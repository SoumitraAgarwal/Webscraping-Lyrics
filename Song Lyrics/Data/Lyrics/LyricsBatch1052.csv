Nana Mouskouri,"A donde ira
Veloz y fatigada
La golondrina
Que de aquí se va
Por si en el viento
Se hallara extraviada
Buscando abrigo
Y no lo encontrara

Junto a mi lecho
Le pondré su nido
En donde pueda
La estación pasar
También yo estoy
En la región perdido
Oh cielo santo!
Y sin poder volar

Deje también
Mi patria idolatrada
Esa mansión
Que me mir nacer
Mi vida es hoy
Errante y angustida
Y ya no puedo
A mi mansión volver

Ave querida
Amada peregrina
Mi corazón
Al tuyo acercare
Voy recordando
Tierna golondrina
Recordare
Mi patria y llorare",La Golondrina
Nana Mouskouri,"Cuando cantas yo canto con tu libertad
Cuando lloras también lloro tu pena
Cuando tiemblas yo rezo por tu libertad
En la dicha o el llanto yo te amo
Recordar días sin luz de tu miseria
Mi canción olvide por un tiempo quien eras

Cuando cantas yo canto con tu libertad
Cuando tu estas ausente yo espero
Es tu religión o quizás realidad
Una idea que a todos nos cambia
Creo yo que eres tu la única verdad
La nobleza de nuestra humanidad
Por tenerte se debe luchar
Esperarte si desfallecer

Cuando cantas yo canto por tu libertad
En la dicha o el llanto yo te amo
La canción de esperanza
Es tu nombre y tu voz
Y la historia nos lleva
Hacia tu eternidad
Libertad libertad",Libertad
Nana Mouskouri,"Cuando salí de la habana, valgame dios
Nadie me ha visto salir sino fui yo
Y una linda guachinanga como una flor
Se vino detrás de mi, que si seor
Si a tu ventana llega una paloma

Tratala con cario que es mi persona
Cuentale tus amores bien de mi vida
Corónala de flores que es cosa mía
Ay chinita que si, ay que dame tu amor
Ay que vente conmigo chinita
A donde vivo yo

Y una linda guachinanga como una flor
Se vino detrás de mi, que si seor
Si a tu ventana llega una paloma
Tratala con cario que es mi persona
Cuntale tus amores bien de mi vida
Corónala de flores que es cosa mía

Ay chinita que si, ay que dame tu amor
Ay que vente conmigo chinita
A donde vivo yo
Ay chinita que si, ay que dame tu amor
Ay que vente conmigo chinita
A donde vivo yo",La Paloma
Nana Mouskouri,"Soledad, chaque nuit berant ma solitude
Un chant monte au loin comme un prlude
Et dans mes rves je te vois
Mais tu n'es pas l

Soledad, dans la forme des nuages
J'imagine ton visage
Que j'ai embrass tant de fois
Mais tu n'es pas l

Soledad, dans mon me sans dfense
Mon chagrin vogue en silence
Je suis forte et ne pleure pas
Mais tu n'es pas l

Et j'entends mes souvenirs qui chantent
Le bruit de ton pas
Le son de ta voix
Tout me parle de toi
Ce n'est pas vrai qu'un jour tu m'oublieras

Et j'entends mes souvenirs qui chantent
C'est plus fort que moi
J'ai le cur qui bat
Tout me parle de toi
Tu me disais que tu n'aimais que moi
Et pourtant que c'est loin tout a
Mon amour, aujourd'hui n'est pas l

Soledad, quand le vent dpendait des toiles
Quand la mer laisse rentrer les voiles
Que je serai bien dans tes bras
Mais tu n'es pas l

Soledad, on dit que le temps efface
Une plus belle amour trpasse
Moi je sais, je ne change pas
Mais tu n'es pas l

Soledad, je lance dans la rivire
Cette rose est ma prire
Et si tu les vois tu sauras
Que je pense toi

Et j'entends mes souvenirs qui chantent
Le bruit de ton pas
Le son de ta voix
Tout me parle de toi
Ce n'est pas vrai qu'un jour tu m'oublieras

Et j'entends mes souvenirs qui chantent
C'est plus fort que moi
J'ai le cur qui bat
Tout me parle de toi
Tu me disais que tu n'aimais que moi
Et j'ai comme un clair de joie
L'espoir qu'un jour tu me reviendras",Soledad
Nana Mouskouri,"Rows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons ev'rywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on ev'ryone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way
I've looked at clouds from both sides now

From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As ev'ry fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained
In living ev'ry day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all
I've looked at life from both sides now
From up and dawn, and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all",Both Sides Now
Nana Mouskouri,"Every time we say goodbye
I die a little
Every time we say goodbye
I wonder why a little
While the Gods above me
Who must be in the know
Think so little of me
They allow you to go

When you're near
There's such an air
Of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere
Begin to sing about it
There's no love song final
But how strange to change
From major to minor
Every time we say goodbye

While the Gods above me
Who must be in the know
Think so little of me
They allow you to go

When you're near
There's such an air
Of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere
Begin to sing about it
There's no love song final
But how strange to change
From major to minor
Every time we say goodbye

Every single time we say goodbye",Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye
Nana Mouskouri,"The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the empty skies, my love
To the dark and the empty skies

The first time ever I kissed your mouth
And felt your heart beat close to mine
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command, my love
That was there at my command

The first time ever I lay with you
I felt the earth move in my hand
I thought our joy would fill the earth
And last till the end of time, my love
And last till the end of time
",The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face
Nana Mouskouri,"If the sun should tumble from the sky 
If the sea should suddenly run dry 
If you love me, really love me 
Let it happen, I won't care 

If it seems that everything is lost 
I will smile and never count the cost 
If you love me, really love me 
Let it happen, darling, I won't care 

Shall I catch a shooting star 
Shall I bring it where you are 
If you want me to, I will 
You can set me any task 
I will anything you ask 
If you'll only love me still 

When at last all life on earth is through 
I will share eternity with you 
If you love me, really love me 
Let what ever happens 
I won't care",If You Love Me
Nana Mouskouri,"Love, love changes everything
Hands and faces, earth and sky
Love, love changes everything
How you live and how you die
Love can make the summer fly
Or a night seem like a lifetime
Yes love, love changes everything
Now I tremble at your name
Nothing in the world will ever be the same

Love, love changes everything
Days are longer words mean more
Love, love changes everything
Pain is deeper than before
Love will turn your world around
And that world will last forever
Yes love, love changes everything
Brings you glory, brings you shame
Nothing in the world will ever be the same

Off into the world we go
Planning futures, shaping years
Love bursts in and suddenly
All our wisdom disappears
Love makes fools of everyone
All the rules we make are broken
Yes love, love changes everyone
Live or perish in it's flame
Love will never never let you be the same

Love will never never let you be the same",Love Changes Everything
Nana Mouskouri,"Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,
And think of you
Caught up in circles confusion 
Is nothing new
Flashback warm nights 
Almost left behind
Suitcases of memories,
Time after 

Sometimes you picture me 
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear
What you've said 
Then you say go slow 
I fall behind 
The second hand unwinds

Chorus:
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has
Turned to gray
Watching through windows you're wondering
If I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time 

Chorus:
If you're lost...

You said go slow 
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds 

[Chorus]
If you're lost
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time

Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,

Flashback warm nights 
Almost left behind
Suitcases of memories,

Nana Mouskouri,"In a world as changeable as skies above
Where the eagle all too often overtakes the dove
There is one thing in this life we can be certain of
Your love, my love

Nation fights with nation
Everyday somewhere
But through every situation
We will not despair

For we know that our salvation
Is the gift we share
Your love, my love
Lock me, desert me

I'll get by love
Now you're my love
Nothing can hurt me
Now I'm sure of your love

When our castles crumble, when our dreams take flight
And we sometimes find it hard to face the morning light
There is one thing that will see us through the darkest night
Your love ,my love

I will never fear what fate may have in store
For with every passing year
I love you more and more
And as long as I'm alive

I will be living for
Your love, my love
Lock me desert me
I'll get by love

Now you're my love
Nothing can hurt me
Now I'm sure of your love
In a world where peace and harmony are strange

And whatever dreams our destiny may rearrange
There is one thing on this earth that time will never change
Your love, my love
Your love, our love","Your Love, My Love"

Quand tu descendras du ciel

Nana Mouskouri,"Do not forsake me oh my darlin'
On this our wedding day
Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'

Wait, wait along
I do not know what fate awaits me
I only know that I must be brave
And I must face a man who hates me

Or lie a coward
A craven coward
Or lie a coward in my grave
Oh to be torn 'tween love and duty
Supposing I lose my fair haired beauty
Look at that big hand move along

Vowed it'd be my life or his'n

What will I do if you leave me",High Noon (Do Not Forsake Me)
Nana Mouskouri,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",The Windmills of Your Mind
Nana Mouskouri,"Hay en RÃ­o, un monte de chocitas, 
Pobrecitas es el morro, de los negros la mansiÃ³n. 
Es tan humilde, tan desgraciada why tan sencilla, 
Ni siquiera una capilla da cobijo para rezar. 

Ave MarÃ­a, Ave MarÃ­a
Aunque no tenga capilla, 
Reza la gente sencilla
Ave MarÃ­a

Cuando hay fiesta, en monte de chocitas, 
Pobrecitas lo celebra con su ritmo ancestral.
Suenan tambores, hay alegrÃ­a, 
Se desenfrenan con los ritmos que resuenan
Con el baile tradicional

Ave MarÃ­a, Ave MarÃ­a
Aunque no tenga capilla, 
Reza la gente sencilla
Ave MarÃ­a

Pero se vive cerca del cielo why con piedad 
why la noche con su manto cubre las chozas, lleva la paz. 
AllÃ¡ se escucha, al fin del dÃ­a una plegaria Ave MarÃ­a. 
AllÃ¡ se escucha, al fin del dÃ­a una plegaria Ave MarÃ­a.

Nana Mouskouri,"Desde que se fue triste vivo yo,
Caminito, amigo, yo también me voy
Desde que se fue nunca mas volvió,
Seguiré sus pasos, Caminito, adiós

Caminito que el tiempo ha borrado
Que juntos un dia nos viste pasar,
He venido por ultima vez
He venido a contarte mi mal

Caminito que entonces estabas
Bordado de trébol y juncos en flor,
Una sombra ya pronto seras
Una sombra lo mismo que yo

Desde que se fue triste vivo yo,
Caminito, amigo, yo también me voy
Desde que se fue nunca mas volvió,
Seguiré sus pasos, Caminito, adiós

Caminito que todas las tardes
Feliz recorria cantando mi amor,
No le digas si vuelve a pasar
Que mi llanto tu suelo regó

Caminito cubierto de cardos
La mano del tiempo tu huella borró
Yo a tu lado quisiera caer
Y que el tiempo nos mate a los dos

Desde que se fue triste vivo yo,
Caminito, amigo, yo también me voy
Desde que se fue nunca mas volvió,
Seguiré sus pasos, Caminito, adiós",Caminito

Negli occhi suoi spunto:
Quelle festosee giovani
Invidiar sembro.

M'ama, lo vedo.

Del suo bel cor sentir!
I miei sospir, confondere
Per poco a' suoi sospir!
Cielo, si puo morir!
Di piu non chiedo.


English Translation

One tear that falls so furtively
From her sweet eyes has just sprung,
As if she envied all the youths
Who laughingly passed her right by.
What could I want more than this?
She loves me! I see it.
One moment just to hear her heart,
Beating so close next to mine,
To hear my sighs like they were hers,
Her sighings as if they were mine!

Nana Mouskouri,"Am Brunnen vor dem Tore
Da steht ein Lindenbaum
Ich träumt in seinem Schatten
So manchen sen Traum
Ich schnitt in seine Rinde
So manches liebe Wort
Es zog in Freud und Leide
Zu ihm mich immer fort

Ich musst auch heute wandern
Vorbei in tiefer Nacht
Da hab ich noch im Dunkeln
Die Augen zugemacht
Und seine Zweige rauschten
Als riefen sie mir zu
Komm her zu mir Geselle
Hier find'st du deine Ruh

Die kalten Winde bliesen
Mir grad ins Angesicht
Der Hut flog mir vom Kopfe
Ich wendete mich nicht
Nun bin ich manche Stunde
Entfernt von jenem Ort
Und immer hr ich's rauschen
Du fndest Ruhe dort
Du fndest Ruhe dort",Der Lindenbaum
Nana Mouskouri,"Please donÂ't begg me stay
IÂ've got my chance to give
IÂ'm done on the bottom canÂ't take any more pain painfull love is all I know
Only chance to dry my tears is to let it go
Why are you so sad
Why are you so sad now
Whne you know

you could have been there for me
You could hade treat me right
You could have care about me
And give me your love
But you choose not to so why so sad

Nana Mouskouri,"Leise flehen meine Lieder
Durch die Nacht zu dir;
In den stillen Hain hernieder,
Liebchen, komm zu mir!

Flsternd schlanke Wipfel rauschen
In des Mondes Licht;
Des Verrters feindlich Lauschen
Frchte, Holde, nicht.

Hrst die Nachtigallen schlagen?
Ach! sie flehen dich,
Mit der Tne sen Klagen
Flehen sie fr mich.

Sie verstehn des Busens Sehnen,
Kennen Liebesschmerz,
Rhren mit den Silbertnen
Jedes weiche Herz.

La auch dir die Brust bewegen,
Liebchen, hre mich!
Bebend harr' ich dir entgegen!
Komm, beglcke mich!",Serenade
Nana Mouskouri,"Voi che sapete
Che cosa Ã¨ amor
|: Donne vedete
S'io l'ho nel cor :|

Quello ch'io provo
Vi ri diro
E per me nuovo
Capir nol so

Sento un affetto
Pien di desir
Ch'ora Ã¨ diletto
Ch'ora Ã¨ matir

Gelo e poi sento
L'alma avvampar
E in un momento
Torno a gelar

Ricerco un bene
Fuori di me
Non sochi il tiene
Non so 'cause'Ã¨

Sospiro e gemo senza voler
Palpito e tremo senza saper
Non trovo pace notte nÃ¨ di
Ma pur mi piace languir cosi

Nana Mouskouri,"Quien no ha llorado diciendo un adiós 
Quien no lleva esa herida en el corazón 
Que ni el paso del tiempo ni un nuevo amor 
Han podido aplacar su dolor 

Quien no ha creido una noche soñar 
Que tan solo era un sueño la cruel realidad 
Quien por unos instantes no tuvo valor 
Deseando jamás despertar 

Nada me puede hacer olvidar 
El vacio que un día dejastes tú en mí 
Y si allá donde estes aún me puedes oir

No tengo otra cosa que darte que un ramo de rosas
De sueÃ±o rebelde why gitano cubierta de flores
Why beso tu boca de grana jugosa manzana
Que me habla de amores

Mujer que conserva el embrujo de tus ojos moros
De rosas de suave fragancia
Que le dieran marco a la Virgen morena

¿Qué poemas nuevos fuiste a buscar?
Una voz antigua de viento y de sal
Te requiebra el alma y la esta llamando
Y te vas hacia alla como en sueños

Cinco sirenitas te llevaran
Por caminos de algas y de coral
Y fosforescentes caballos marinos haran
Una ronda a tu lado
Y los habitantes del agua van a jugar
Pronto a tu lado

Bajame la lampara un poco mas
Déjame que duerma, nodriza en paz
Y se llama él no le digas que estoy
Dile que Alfonsina no vuelve
Y se llama él no le digas nunca que estoy
Di que me he ido

Me dio el corazon que agita su marco
Cuando miro el fruto del cerebro humano
Cuando miro el bueno tan lejos del malo
Cuando miro el fondo de tus ojos claros

Esto no puede ser no mas que una cancion
Quisiera fuera una declaracion de amor
Romantica sin reparar en formas tales
Que ponga freno a lo que siento ahora a raudales
Te amo
Te amo
Eternamente te amo
Si me faltaras no voy a morirme
Si he de morir quiero que sea contigo
Mi soledad se siente acompaÃ±ada
Por eso a veces se que necesito
Tu mano
Tu mano
Eternamente tu mano
Cuando te vi sabia que era cierto
Este temor de hallarme descubierto
Tu me desnudas con siete razones
Me abres el pecho siempre que me colmas
De amores
De amores
Eternamente de amores
Si alguna vez me siento derrotado
Renuncio a ver el sol cada maÃ±ana
Rezando el credo que me has enseÃ±ado
Miro tu cara why digo en la ventana

Holy infant, so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace

Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia

Nana Mouskouri,"Fat man lookin' in a blade of steel, thin man lookin' at his last meal
Hollow man lookin' in a cottonfield for dignity

Wise man lookin' in a blade of grass, young man lookin' in the shadows
That pass
Poor man lookin' through painted glass for dignity

CHORUS #1:
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave
I went into the city, went into the town
Went into the land of the midnight sun

Searchin' high, searchin' low, searchin' everywhere I know
Askin' the cops wherever I go, ""Have you seen Dignity?""

Blind man breakin' out of a trance, puts both his hands in the pocket of
Chance
Hopin' to find one circumstance of dignity

I went to the wedding of Mary-lou, she said I don't want nobody see me
Talkin to you
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity

CHORUS #2:
I went down where the vultures feed
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men, wasn't any
Difference to me

Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade, house on fire, debts unpaid
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, ""Have you seen dignity?""

Drinkin' man listens to the voice he hears
In a crowded room full of covered up mirrors
Lookin' into the lost forgotten years for dignity

Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity

CHORUS #3:
Footprints runnin' cross the silver sand, steps goin' down into tatoo
Land
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light, in the bordertowns of
Despair

Got no place to fade, got no coat, I'm on the rollin' river in a jerkin'
Boat
Tryin' to read a note somebody wrote about dignity

Sick man lookin' for the doctor's cure, lookin' at his hands for the
Lines that were
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity

Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
Combin his hair back his future looks thin
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity

CHORUS #4:
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed, dignity never been
Photographed
I went into the red, went into the black, into the valley of dry bone
Dreams

So many roads, so much at stake, so many dead ends, I'm at the edge of
The lake
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity

When we shared our lives, our hopes
I thought that we belonged and if that is true
How can I go on without you ?

Time was mine but doesn't hide my heart
Life just goes on without meaning

They last forever
In my heart I know
If love was that way
It will always be(It will always be)

Through my tears as I'm looking back at us
You touched me in a place deep in my soul

I gave to only you;
No one else can love me
Just the way you do.
No matter what we go through,

That tells me just how much

How far your love would go.

Eyes that warm my heart just like the sun
In them I can see a million days to come
There beneath the sky
Besides the one who brings me happiness
How can I express

are-
This is the sound of my heart
Whispering softly in the dark
Words that are simple and true
This is my song for you

Love is the music I find
In every breath, every sigh
One precious gift shared by two
This is my song for you

Hold me close I need to feel you near
Oh! You are the joy inside of every tear
And I've always known
That words alone could never quite reveal
This love I feel

We've traveled through so many seasons now
We've seen joy, we've seen pain and fear
You and I, we made it through somehow

So light our hope and let it catch the breeze
Close you eyes and we can set it free
And though tomorrow's not for us to see
We must follow everywhere it leads

Just let it go, let it go, let it go
Like a star that lights the way
Like a lullaby that calls to you
That's the way our love should always be
Let it go, like the tears of yesterday
Like the laughter of tomorrow
A gift for all eternity
For you, for me

So here's to love and all our future years
These are times we will remember them
And every moment is our souvenir
I'll share them with you until the end

The horizon has blinded my sight again

The earth lies frozen in the chill
My fingers idly trace your name
Across the icy window pane
The stars look down so bright and clear
I close my eyes and wish you near
""You come to me, you always do""
I dreamed you
All at once the winter's done
And warm my field the summer sun
We walked through fields where flowers grow
The way we did so long ago
I leave this weary world behind
And softly find you in my mind
'Cause lying in the morning dew
I dreamed you
I dreamed your fingers touched my face
I feel you're locked in my embrace
""As once more you are mine, but now...""
The summer sun is growing dim
I stand here lonely in the wind
And hear the sounds of spring no more

A sad and a long lonely day
I walk the avenue and hope I'll run into
The welcome sight of you coming my way

I stop just across from your door
But you're never home any more
So back to my room and there in the gloom
I cry tears of good bye

Till you come back to me
That's the way it will be
Every day in the life of a fool

I stop just across from your door
But you're never home any more
So back to my room and there in the gloom

Nana Mouskouri,"How do you keep the music playing
How do you make it last
How do keep the song from fading
Too fast
How do you lose yourself to someone
And never lose your way
How do you not run out of new things
To say
And since you know we're always changing
How can it be the same
You're sure your heart will fall apart
Each time you hear her name
If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day
To make it better as it goes
With any luck than I suppose
The music never ends",How Do You Keep the Music Playing?
Nana Mouskouri,"Laura is the face in the misted light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The love that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall

Have you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura, but she's only a dream

Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.

Side on which you lie

And so she takes her summer times
Tells the moon to wait and the sun to linger
Twists the world around her summer finger

And if you learned your lesson well
There's little more for her to tell
One last caress it's time to dress for fall

Nana Mouskouri,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember

To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine, that's your way

While you were the one with all the strength
Beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain

And everything I would like to be
I can fly higher than an eagle

But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know I know the truth,of course I know
I would be nothing without you

Nana Mouskouri,"Speed bonnie boat, like a bird on the wing,
Onward, the sailors cry
Carry the lad that's born to be king
Over the sea to skye

Loud the winds howl, loud the waves roar,
Thunder clouds rend the air;
Baffled our foe's stand on the shore
Follow they will not dare

Though the waves leap, soft shall ye sleep
Ocean's a royal bed
Rocked in the deep, Flora will keep
Watch by your weary head

Many's the lad fought on that day
Well the claymore could wield
When the night came, silently lay
Dead on Culloden's field

Burned are our homes, exile and death
Scatter the loyal men
Yet, e'er the sword cool in the sheath,
Charlie will come again.

*note: This song commemorates the escape of Bonnie Prince Charlie from these
Shores when Flora MacDonald took him, disguised as a serving maid,
From Uist to Skye in a small boat.
Flora is buried at Kilmuir on the north coast of Skye. Prince Charlie
Near Rome where he was born.

Nana Mouskouri,"There's a village hidden deep in the valley
Among the pine trees and forlorn
And there on a sunny morning
Lil' Jimmy Brown was born

So his parents brought him to the chapel
When he was only one day old
And the priest blessed the little fellow
Welcomed him into the fold

All the chapel bells were ringing
In the little valley town
And the song that they were singing
Was for baby, Jimmy Brown

There's a village hidden deep in the valley
Beneath the mountains high above
And there, twenty years thereafter
Jimmy Brown was to meet his love

Many friends were gathered in the chapel
And many tears of joy were shed
In June on a Sunday morning
When Jimmy Brown and his bride were wed

All the chapel bells were ringing
'T was a great day in his life
All the songs that they were singing
Were for Jimmy and his wife

From the village hidden deep in the valley
One rainy morning dark and gray
A soul wound its way to Heaven
Jimmy Brown had passed away

Silent people gathered in the chapel
To say, ""Farewell"" to their old friend
Whose life had been like a flower
Budding, blooming 'till the end

Just a lonely bell was ringing
In the little valley town
'T was farewell that it was singing
To our good old, Jimmy Brown

And the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
""Lead us not into temptation""
Make his soul find a salvation
Of thy great eternal love""

Nana Mouskouri,"Qui dove il mare luccica
E tira forte il vento
Sulla vecchia terrazza
Davanti al golfo di surriento

Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza
Dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce
E ricomincia il canto

Te voglio bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
E' una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare
Penso alle notti la in America
Ma erano solo le lampare
E la bianca scia di un'elica

Senti il dolore nella musica
E si alzo dal pianoforte
Ma quando vide uscire
La luna da una nuvola
Gli sembro piu dolce anche la morte

Guardo negli occhi la ragazza
Quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvviso usci una lacrima
E lui credette di affogare

Potenza della lirica
Dove ogni dramma e un falso
Che con un po'di trucco e con la mimica
Puoi diventare un altro

Ma due occhi che ti quardano
Cosi vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole
Confondono I pensierei

'cause diventa tutto piccolo
Anche le notti la in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita
Dietro la scia di un'elica

Ma si, e la vita che finisce
E non ce penso poi tanto
Anzi, si sentiva gia felice
E ricomincio il suo canto

Te voglio bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
E una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai

Nana Mouskouri,"My life has been a tapestry of rich and royal hue,
An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view.
A wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold
A tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold.

Once, amid the soft, silver sadness in the sky,
There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by.
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide,
And a coat of many colors, yellow, green on either side.

He moved with some uncertainty, as if he didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go.
Once he reached for something golden, hanging from a tree,
And his hand came down empty.

Soon within my tapestry, along the rutted road,
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad.
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell,
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well.

As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure, gray and ghostly, beneath a flowing beard.
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black.
Now my tapestry's unraveling; he's come to take me back.
He's come to take me back.

Sad, deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving
Ah, but then you know it's time for them to go
But I will still be here, I have no thought of leaving
I do not count the time

For who knows where the time goes?

I heard a maid sing in the valley below
""Oh don't deceive me, Oh never leave me,
How could you use, a poor maiden so?""
Remember the vows that you made to me truly
Remember how tenderly you nestled close to me
Gay is the garland, fresh are the roses
I've culled from the garden to bind over thee.

Here I now wander alone as I wonder
Why did you leave me to sigh and complain
I ask of the roses, why should I be forsaken,
Why must I here in sorrow remain?

Through yonder grove, by the spring that is running
There you and I have so merrily played,
Kissing and courting and gently sporting
Oh, my innocent heart you've betrayed

How could you slight so a pretty girl who loves you
A pretty girl who loves you so dearly and warm?
Though love's folly is surely but a fancy,
Still it should prove to me sweeter than your scorn.

Soon you will meet with another pretty maiden
Some pretty maiden, you'll court her for a while,
Thus ever ranging, turning and changing
Always seeking for a girl that is new.

Thus sang the maiden, her sorrows bewailing
Thus sang the poor maid in the valley below
""Oh don't deceive me, Oh never leave me,
How could you use, a poor maiden so?""",Early One Morning

Nana Mouskouri,"Quelle importance le temps qu'il nous reste
Nous aurons la chance de vieillir ensemble
Au fond de tes yeux vivra ma tendresse
Au fond de mon cœur vivra ta jeunesse

Comme une prière du temps de l'enfance
Ces mots sur tes lèvres me donnent confiance
Je nous imagine ta main dans la mienne
Nos moindres sourires voudront dire je t'aime

Mais l'un de nous s'en ira le premier
Il fermera ses yeux à jamais
Dans un tout dernier sourire
Et l'autre en perdant la moitié de sa vie
Restera chaque jour dans la nuit
Son cœur bien sûr battra mais pour qui mais pourquoi

Ton pas résonne la porte s'entrouvre
Mon cœur bat plus vite et je te retrouve
Quand nos mains se tiennent j'oublie tout le reste
J'ai l'impression même que le temps s'arrête

Mais l'un de nous s'en ira le premier
Il fermera ses yeux à jamais
Dans un tout dernier sourire
Un jour l'un de nous sera trop fatigué
S'en ira presque heureux le premier
Et l'autre s'en tarder viendra le retrouver

Je nous imagine ta main dans la mienne
Nos moindres sourires voudront dire je t'aime

How I long to be there
With Marie who's waitin' for me there.
Ev'ry lonely city where I hang my hat
Ain't as half as pretty as where my baby's at.

Is this the way to Amarillo?
Ev'ry night I've been huggin' my pillow
Dreamin' dreams of Amarillo
And sweet Marie who waits for me.
Show me the way to Amarillo
I've been weepin' like a willow
Cryin' over Amarillo
And sweet Marie who waits for me.

There's a church bell ringin'
Hear the sound of joy that it's singin'
For the sweet Maria
And the guy who's comin' to see her.
Just beyond the highway
Lies an open plain
And it keeps me goin'
Through the wind and rain.

What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be

Someone true to love

For when you hear a call
To follow your heart
You'll follow your heart

I've been through it all
And I'm a old hand

Thrill me, thrill me
Walk me down the lane where shadows will be, will be
Hiding lovers just the same as we'll be, we'll be
When you make me tell you I love you
(Will you take me in your arms)
They told me, ""Be sensible with your new love
Don't be fooled thinking this is the last you'll find""
But they never stood in the dark with you, love
When you take me in your arms
and drive me slowly out of my mind
Kiss me, kiss me, and when you do
I know that you will miss me, miss me
If we ever say adieu, so kiss me, kiss me

Nana Mouskouri,"My story is much to sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree, fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
But I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me, you obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane, flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do, yet I get a kick out of you

The right time for kissing
But night time is my time
For just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting
With somebody else

There'll be no one , unless
That someone is you, you, you

When your heart is on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes""
So I shut them, and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I'm without my love
Now laughing friends deride

Nana Mouskouri,"Our love was like a song
A lovely melody
Our hearts will sing along
In perfect harmony
But you forgot all the words
While I still remember the tune

Each time our lips will cling
I heard a silly name
Of love when you can spring
Forever to be played
But you forgot all the words
When I still remember the tune

We used to dance
Instead of walk
We used to sing
Instead of talk
Why with a love song that used to be
All the stars are blue for me

But songs are funny things
They never really die
And so my hope still clings
That someday you will try
To just remember the words

For I still remember the tune
For I still remember the tune",You Forgot All the Words

How many gentle flowers grow
In an English country garden?
I'll tell you now of some I know
And those I'll miss I hope you'll pardon
Daffodils, heart's ease and flox
Meadowsweet and lilly stalks
Gentain, lupine and tall hollihocks
Roses, foxgloves, snowdrops, forget-me-nots
In an English country garden.

How many insects find their home
In an English country garden?
I'll tell you now of some I know
Those I miss I hope you'll pardon
Dragonflies, moths and bees
Spiders falling from the trees
Butterflies sway in the mild gentle breeze
There are hedgehogs that roam
And little gnomes
In an English country garden.

How many songbirds make their nests
In an English country garden?
I'll tell you now of some I know
Those I miss I hope you'll pardon
Bobolink, coo cooing doves
Blacbirds and the whirlwind thrush
Bluebird, lark, pigeon, nightingale
We all smile in the spring
When the birds all start to sing
In an English country garden.

Robin, don't forget the Robin.

By love's light my foot finds the old path way to thee.

Chorus:
Bheir mi oh a ro van oh;bheir mi oh a ro van e.

Thou art music of my heart;Harp of joy oh cush ma cree

And my father won't slight for your lack of kind
And he stepped away from me and this he did say
""It will not be long,love,till our wedding day
He stepped away from me and he went through the fair
And fondly I watched him move here and move there
And then he went honward with one star awake
As the swan in the evening moves over the lake
The people were saying ""No two were e'er wed
But one had a sorrow that never was said
And I smile as he passed with his goods and his gear
And that was the last that I saw of my dear
Last night he came to me,he came softly in
So softly he came that his feet made no din
And he laid his hand on me and this he did say

Mamma's got her chicken soup of love 
For the bad old world is sick with hate

That you can hum when you're alone

And finds someone comes back for more

Maybe this time
The cards will treat you right
Deal a little magic in the middle of some lonely night
Maybe this time, this time

I always smile, act caviler
But what I feel behind the smiles, a little fear
I'm just like you, nobody's fool
Whenever someone gets to close I play it cool

But maybe this time
We'll find the other key that opens up another door
And find someone comes back for more
Maybe this time, this time

You turn to go but then you hesitate
I wonder can I make you wait
Aren't we a pair afraid to care?

I see the light of love in your eyes
Love is forever, no more good-byes

Now just a memory the tears that I cried
Now just a memory the sighs that I sighed
Dreams that I cherished all have come true
All my tomorrows I give to you

Over and over I whisper your name
Over and over I kiss you again
I see the light of love in your eyes
Love is forever, no more good-byes

Life's summer leaves may turn into gold
The love that we share will never grow old

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed nor hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one

Nana Mouskouri,"Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night beside her
And you know that she's half crazy
But that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
Then she gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover
And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind.
And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said ""All men will be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them""
But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind.
Now Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you to the river
She is wearing rags and feathers
From Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look
Among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror
And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind.",Suzanne
Nana Mouskouri,"Adios my love
I'll always be true
I'll miss you so
But this you know
I'll wait forever and ever
Saving my love for you

The rolling tide that brings you to me
Must take you back to roam on the sea
But as I wait alone on the shore
You know my love is yours forever more
Since time began,a man had to roam
A girl must wait to welcome him home
But every day while you are away
I'll love you more than words can ever say

Adios my love
I'll always be true
I'll miss you so
But this you know
I'll wait forever and ever
Saving my love for you
I'll wait forever, and ever
Saving my love for you

The rolling tide that brings you to me
Must take you back to roam on the sea
But as I wait alone on the shore
You know my love is yours forever more

Adios my love
I'll always be true
Adios my love
Adios my love

Nana Mouskouri,"Church steeples, songs of a bird
Soft crying nobody heard
Lives are passed around,
Eye looks at the ground
Wind can whistle cold,
And rich men don't grow old

[Chorus:]
The seed is sown, no harvest to collect
Just second-class of factory reject
And four of you, the power and the glory

Hearts breaking, don't make a sound
Landlord buys ten acres of ground
Castles in the air, climb them if you dare
Look, don't try to see me, to be is not to be

For some it's cold, for some it's warm
For some it's sunny
While men still look in the street outside
For milk and honey

Nana Mouskouri,"Pintor nacido en mi tierra, 
Con el pincel extranjero, 
Pintor que sigues el rumbo, 
De tantos pintores viejos 

Siempre que pintas iglesias, 
Pintas angelitos bellos, 
Pero nunca te acordaste, 
De pintar un ángel negro

Pintor si pintas con amor, 
¿por qué desprecias su color, 
Si sabes que en el cielo, 
También los quiere dios?

Pintor de santos de alcoba, 
Si tienes alma en el cuerpo, 
¿por qué al pintar en tus cuadros, 
Te olvidaste de los negros? 

Aunque la virgen sea blanca, 
Píntame angelitos negros, 
Que también se van al cielo, 
Todos los negritos buenos",Angelitos Negros
Nana Mouskouri,"Te regalo una rosa
La encontré en el camino

O tiene amor escondido

Ay, ay, ay, ay amor!
Eres la rosa que me da calor
Eres el sueño de mi soledad
Un letargo de azul
Un eclipse de mar

Pero Ay, ay, ay, ay amor!
Yo soy satélite y tú eres mi sol
Un universo de agua mineral
Un espacio de luz
Que sólo llenas tú

Ay amor!

Te regalo mis manos
Mis párpados caí­dos
El beso más profundo
El que se ahoga en un gemido

Te regalo un otoño
Un día entre abril y junio
Un rayo de ilusiones
Un corazón al desnudo

Nana Mouskouri,"Dicen que la distancia es el olvido
Pero yo no concibo esa razón
Porque yo seguir siendo el cautivo
De los caprichos de tu corazón
Supiste esclarecer mis pensamientos
Me diste la verdad que yo so
Ahuyentaste de mi los sufrimientos
En la primera noche que te amo

Hoy mi playa se viste de amargura
Porque tu barca tiene que partir
A cruzar otros mares de locura
Cuida que no naufrague en tu vivir
Cuando la luz del sol se esta apagando
Y te sientas cansada de vagar
Piensa que yo por ti estar esperando
Hasta que tu decidas regresar",La Barca

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

I viewed the morning, with much alarm

Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

That would bore me terrifically too

She stepped away from me, and she went thro' the fair.
And fondly I watched her move here and move there.

So softly she came that her feet made no din.

As every fairy tale comes real.

But now it's just another show.
Leave 'em laughin' when you go.
But if you care, don't let em' know
Don't give yourself away.

From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall.
I really don't know love at all.
Tears and fears and feeling proud,
Say ""I love you"" right out loud.
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way.
But now old friends are acting strange.
They shake their heads and say I've changed.
But something's lost when somethings gained

Die mein Lied besingt
In der Sonne liegen
Heimat spüren

Nana Mouskouri,"Plaisir d'amour ne dure qu'un moment
Chagrin d'amour dure toute la vie
Tu m'as quitté pour la belle Sylvie
Elle te quitte pour un autre amant

Nana Mouskouri,"Huh listen!
Do you have to go shake your head (yes or no)
Do you have to go tell me it isn't so
Do you wonder why it makes us cry everytime we say goodbye
Do you ever give in to what you believe
You know I never want you to leave
Do you wonder why it
Makes us cry everytime we say goodbye

[Chorus]
Catch your breath and I'll catch mine
Why does it feel like the end of the world
I've felt [read?] and I've seen and I've heard

About the power in that word
Goodbye, I know it's not forever
Goodbye, I don't understand
Why it seems so silly to cry everytime we say goodbye

I don't see how you've become so far away
I'm around the new friends I have found
But you mean so much more I just can't ignore
You're the one that I adore
It's so crazy there's just not a choice
My heart beats just to hear your voice
Do you wonder why it makes us cry everytime we say goodbye

[Chorus]

Funny how when you are younger
You just giggle at a farewell kiss
I never knew it could be like this
The way you're watching from the outside
You can see what's in a soul
I guess that loving someone makes us all

[Chorus]",Everytime We Say Goodbye
Nana Mouskouri,"It's by far the hardest thing I've ever done
To be so in love with you and so alone

Follow me where I go, what I do and who I know
Make it part of you to be a part of me
Follow me up and down, all the way and all around
Take my hand and say you'll follow me

It's long been on my mind, you know, it's been a long time
I'll try to find the way that I can make you understand
The way I feel about you and just how much I need you
To be there where I can talk to you when there's no one else around

Follow me where I go, what I do and who I know
Make it part of you to be a part of me
Follow me up and down, all the way and all around
Take my hand and I will follow too

You see, I'd like to share my life with you and show you things I've seen
Places that I'm going to, places where I've been
To have you there beside me and never be alone
And all the time that you're with me, then we will be at home

Follow me where I go, what I do and who I know
Make it part of you to be a part of me
Follow me up and down, all the way and all around
Take my hand and say you'll follow me

Follow me where I go, what I do and who I know
Make it part of you to be a part of me
Follow me up and down, all the way
Take my hand and I will follow too
Take my hand and I will follow too

",Follow Me [#]
Nana Mouskouri,"For all we know
We may never meet again
Before you go
Make this moment sweet again

We won't say goodnight
Until the last minute
I'll hold out my hand
And my heart will be in it

For all we know
This may only be a dream
We come and go
Like a ripple on a stream

So love me, tonight
Tomorrow was made for some
Tomorrow may never come
For all we know
Tomorrow may never come

Nana Mouskouri,"He gave to me a silver ring
To wear upon my hand
But I turned away
And he heard me saying
""Oh!he doesn't, he doesn't understand""
Refrain
I don't need riches to make me care
Just a ribbon for my hair

He gave me two golden hearts
To wear upon my ears
But I turned from him
So he could not see
My eyes, my eyes were filled with tears

He tought I was unhappy
But he could not fight no more
So he bought me just a ribbon
For a penny at the store

He bought me just a ribbon blue
To wear in my hair
Then I pressed my lips
To his fingerstips,
Saying ""Now, now I know you care
I don't need riches to make me care",Hust a Ribbon
Nana Mouskouri,"I'll remember you
When I've forgotten all the rest
You to me were true
You to me were the best

When there is no more
You can do the core
Quicker than anyone I knew
When I'm all alone
In the great unknown
I'll remember you

I'll remember you
At the end of the trail
I have so much left to do
I have so little time to fail

There's some people that you don't forget
Even though you wanna see them
One time or two
When the roses fade
And I'm in the shade
I'll remember you

Didn't I, didn't I try to love you?
Didn't I, didn't I try to care?
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
With the wind blowing in your hair?

I'll remember you
When the wind blows in the pile of wood
It was you who came right through
It was you who understood

Though I'd never say
When I'm gone away
That you don't love me too
In the end, my dear sweet friend
I'll remember you

Though I'd never say
When I'm gone away
That you don't love me too
In the end, my dear sweet friend
I'll, I'll remember you
",I'll Remember You
Nana Mouskouri,"The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to you door

The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know
The many ways I've tried

And still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door

But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here

Nana Mouskouri,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life tha's full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exception

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit it off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and threw it out, I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subsides
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way
Oh no, no, no not me
I did it my way

For what is a woman, what has she got?
If not herself, then she has naught
To say the things she truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

",My Way
Nana Mouskouri,"Sometimes I remember the old days
When the world was filled with sorrow
You might have taught I was living
But I was all alone, in my heart the rain was falling
The wind blew, the night was calling
Come back, come back, I'm all you've ever known

Open the door and come on in
I'm so glad to see you my friend
You're like a rainbow coming around the bend
And when I see you happy,well it sets my heart free
I'd like to be as good a friend to you as you are to me

There were friends who could always see me
Through the haze, their smiles would reach me
Saying ""OK "" saying goodbye, saying hello
Now we've perhaps stormy weather, the sunshine though
When we' re together I' ll be your friend, right through to the end

Open the door and come on in
I'm so glad to see you my friend
You're like a rainbow coming around the bend
And when I see you happy,well it sets my heart free
I'd like to be as good a friend to you as you are to me

Nana Mouskouri,"Baby,
They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied
""Something here inside
Cannot be denied""

They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed and I gaily laughed
To think they would doubt my love
Yet today, my love has flown away
I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
""When a lovely flame dies,
Smoke gets in your eyes.""",Smoke Gets Your Eyes
Nana Mouskouri,"Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue

Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left inside
On that starry, starry night

You took your life as lovers often do
But I could have told you Vincent
This world was never meant for one as
Beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hang in empty halls
Frame less heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

And now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will

Nana Mouskouri,"When I fall in love it will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I fall in love with you.

And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I fall in love with you.",When I Fall in Love
Nana Mouskouri,"Across the morning sky all the birds are leaving
But how can they know it's time for them to go?
Before the Winter's fire
I will still be dreaming
I have no thought of time

For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?

Sad deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving
Ah and yet they know it time for them to go

But I will still be here
I have no thought of leaving
I do not count the time

For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?

And I am not alone while my love is near
And I know it will be so until it's time to go

So count the storms of winter
And then the birds in spring again
I have no fear of time

For who knows how my love grows?
And who knows where the time goes?

For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?",Who Knows Where the Time Goes
Nana Mouskouri,"In a world as changeable as skies above
Where the eagle all too often overtakes the dove
There is one thing in this life we can be certain of
Your love, my love

Nation fights with nation, everyday somewhere
But through every situation we will not despair
For we know that our salvation is the gift we share
Your love, my love

Lock me, desert me
I'll get by love, now you're my love
Nothing can hurt me, now I'm sure of your love

When our castles crumble and our dreams take flight
And we sometimes find it hard to face the morning light
There is one thing that will see us through the darkest night
Your love, my love

I will never fear what fate may have in store
For with every passing year, I love you more and more
And as long as I'm alive, I will be living for
Your love, my love

Lock me, desert me
I'll get by love, now you're my love
Nothing can hurt me
Now, I'm sure of your love

In a world where peace and harmony are strange
And whatever dreams our destiny may rearrange
There is one thing on this earth that time will never change
Your love, my love, your love, our love

I was playing soft while Bobby sang the blues.

Quand on s’aimait
Comme on s’aimait
Mon amour
De mois de mai 
En mois de mai
Chaque jour

Nos cœurs couraient la chance
 Mordant à pleines dents 
Dans le fruits mur de nos vingt ans
Quand j’y pense 
On aurait pu se rencontrer
Maintenant
Et commencer à nous aimer
Comme avant quand ta jeunesse entre mes bras
Pleurait déjà
Mais toi tu ne le savais pas

Quand on s’aimait
Comme on s’aimait

De mois de mai 
En mois de mai
Chaque jour

C’était comme un dimanche
Qui n’en finirait pas
Comme un printemps sur les lilas
Qui se penche
Quand reviendra le mois de mai

Je sais que je te reviendrai
Pour toujours
Et dans le soleil retrouvé

Burning from day to day

Got a smile to still the city,
And Lord, you know, you got those sleepy eyes.
Alabama sweet-talking baby,
Calmed the heart of a lonely lady,
You kept me flying high,
And the leaving easy.
And it's Dallas in the rain,
And I was dreaming.

October winds still blowing, Lord,
You know the song were flowing
From a broken-hearted lady
By the wayside.
Listen to my song, you
Kept it ringing clean and strong,
You held me like an angel
To confide in.
And I tried to make you home,
But I was dreaming.

Lord, I guess you just ain't home,
That damned old telephone
Is trying hard to help me find
The lines here.
Wish that you could understand
Why I love the other man,
He gives me truth and reason,
I believe in.

Nanci Griffith,"Ronnie stood beneath the movie marquee
His memories all curled up inside
He was trying to remember
Was it August or September
He'd seen her for the last time

He'd heard that she'd become an actress
Lord, she always had the prettiest face
And he stood with his hands
In his pockets and waited
For the dollar matinee

Lord, she's bigger than life on the screen
There's a laugh from the balcony, good Lord
And the sun will burn you and blind you
When you step back into the street

The theater, she smelled so familiar
She was a smokey old velvet delight
Yes, and he sat down front
Just like he'd always done
With his feet hanging out in the aisles

And he watched her with eyes disbelieving
Felt something like time on his brain
And he told himself
Don't you remember it's only
Just a part that she's playing

Lord, she's bigger than life on the screen
There's a laugh from the balcony, good Lord
And the sun will burn you and blind you
When you step back into the street

She stood by some window in Paris
While the captions translated the scene
Oh, and Ronnie stared back
At her body and breathed
""Christ, that's the first time I've seen it!""

Behind him the people were leaving
Well, the busses, they were humming outside
But old Ronnie never went
To the movies unless
He could stay and see it twice

Nanci Griffith,"Oh, your golden lights of America,
Joseph sought your prairies and your buffalo.
And the humming of the rails down through Kansas,
They brought Joseph in from Baltimore.
The Cavalry, the Indians, and an old dan were his only friends.
Then the old dan died and the Indians' plight
Made the Cavalry young Joe's enemy.

Oh, the outlaws spilled the blood across the
Kansas plains back in the '70s.
Joseph took a badge for America
To defend you from your fantasies.
Joseph wore that badge across the Kansas
Prairies to save the railroads.
But the heroes that we made, well, they were
Ruthless soldiers who'd kill for gold.

With a broken heart for the frontier plains,
Joseph sat a-rocking in his front-porch swing.
That old tin badge is tarnished now,
You know it was just a young man's dream.
And old man's tales are hard to reach when you
Don't believe in your American Dream.

They died from memory.

Nanci Griffith,"He was a simple man only to a stranger.
And the kindness in his eyes
I still remember.
Now that he is old,
They say he's angry and he's cold,
That his soul is dying.

He's a wealthy man's dream,
And he's a working man's dime.
He has stood in both men's shoes
In his own damn time.
The hard times of the thirties
Still linger in his mind
When he is lonely.
He's out there in the cold,
Twenty years away from home.
Does he dream about his old home
In San Antone?
He's often watched the highways,
But he's a man of sixty-five.
Where ain't a soul in El Paso
Who would give an old drunk a ride.

Now, he traded in his draftsman's pen
For a fishing pole.
And his mansion on the hill
Is an alley in El Paso.
The anchors of the fifties
Still hold to broken dreams
When his sorrows grow.

Nanci Griffith,"There's a light out on the freeway
Says it's time to go
I'm wasting my time counting
Stains on a barroom floor
Thinking 'bout my hometown
And the friends I'll leave behind
Mostly 'bout the man who writes
His songs with smiling rhymes
And I'm holding on to a smokey view
Of his dreams in the midnight light

Michael counts his songs
In the years of wasted miles
I used to think he was really part
Of that fantasy in rhyme
But looking back on all his tunes
Of butterflies and sunshine
There was only one about the
Man he kept inside
About the time he crossed the line
And let a tear come to his eye

I used to hide out
In his pretty smile
And hope it would shine me
Through the morrow
Until I learned the way
It feels to be the man
Who sings the world a smile
Without a soul to share his sorrow

The light here at the freeway
Well, it's turning green to gold
The stains on that barroom floor
Ten miles back down the road
Thinking 'bout how that old bar
Brought Michael back to mind
And how I can sing his blues
And be smiling here inside
I guess a weary soul will always

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Marilyn Monroe/Neon and Waltzes

Where does the love go when it dies?
Hey, I want you to know, love never dies,
It is sheltered here very safe inside and it's left you
With a friend out in the madness

And you say you love me still,
How your soul does change and your heart still ponders,
How I could grow fonder, of a life out on my own
I still sing the harmony
I'll have another wine and toast this madness
I'll howl at your moon, on my way home alone

Nanci Griffith,"Down at the station the tracks are cold
The wheels of thunder, they roll no more
And the heart of America cries for the souls
Who won't be rollin' home
The dragon weeps with empty eyes,
The whistle sighs no more in the night 

It rests in the lines, like a ghost in the music,
The soul of America's pride
Toil of our fathers with foreign hands,
They laid the tracks and they opened the plains
They fought the mountains and they merged our seas
They set America free

Tell me
Where is the blaze of the hobo's caldron?
The refuge for these poor and these fallen?
It rests in the lines, like a ghost in the music,
The soul of America's pride

American son, father see what your son has done
He's torn up the mountains
And reshaped the plains
The dreams he dreams aren't the same
To the fallen ones who may still be askin,
""Who'd take time to stir these ashes,
Who'll hear the lines of a ghost in the music
And kindle America's pride?""

It's the last winter storm of the season and such
And I am lost to the fiction of the book in my lap
The snow makes me drowsy, while the dreams roll and tumble,
It's a long way to Texas, it's a long way back home
It's a three hour flight on the plane when I go
Away from this snow from Boston to Southshore where the
Dreams roll and tumble, and bring the prose to the wheel,

And if the cards were all laid on the table, now darlin'

I would not be the woman that I am
And I have seen my share of long nights
And I have told my share of lies
And I have run into the darkness, now darlin'
When I saw the look in your eyes

But if the night didn't lie in the darkness
Then the daylight would be hard to find
And if the truth didn't turn to a weakness, now babe
I would have never have spoken my mind

Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

Acting like I was part of your property

I'm so tired of going any way the
Wind blows
And I thought that me and you

But never mind

[Chorus:]
Never mind, never mind
I'm just talkin' through the wine
And you know that drinkin' always
Makes me sad
But before this night is through

I better say I love you
Or I'm gonna always wish that
I had
I first saw you pickin' oranges
In Orlando
All day you kept your ladder close
To mine
We froze in Georgia, burned up

In Chicago
And I always thought that we,
But never mind
Did you know today my baby called
You daddy?
Sometimes I've wished that she was
Yours and mine
I could call my brother Milt in Cincinnati
And ask him for a loan,
But never mind

Nanci Griffith,"I don't wanna be standing here
With this ticket for this outbound plane
Oh, I've been here before
Somehow this doesn't feel the same
Talk is cheap
So we could talk all night long
And we may never figure out just
Where your love went wrong

[Chorus:]
'Cause I don't wanna be standin' here
Don't wanna be talkin' here
And I don't really care who's to blame
'Cause if love won't fly on it's own
Free will
It's gonna catch that outbound plane

The old folks say
That love's not forever anymore
Because these young people walk
Away from love alone
To pace the floor
Young or old I say that love is still the same
You may walk away from love but
You'll fall head and heels again

Two lonely hearts in this airport
Knowing
Neither cares where that other
Heart is going
But, if love won't fly on it's own
Free will, it's gonna catch that

That frown you're wearing's
Just you're halo turned upside down
Where is the laughter we once
Shared back in the lost and found?
These broken wings are gonna leave
Me here to stand my ground
You can have this ticket for that
Lonely plane that's flying out

Nanci Griffith,"My daddy sent me on to Baton Rouge in 1969
He said our love was like a forest fire and he'd end it with a mind
So you rode with us to Temple, Texas where I did catch the train
And I remember waving back at you from a silted window pane

[Chorus:]
And I said fare thee well true love of mine
And I said fare thee well sweet lips of wine
And you said fare thee well my Texas rose
And then you blew a kiss of innocence as the trains began to roll
So long ago

You'd gone off to fight the war when I returned from school
And I traded in my innocence when the springtime came in bloom
And I married for my family; one night I dreamed of you
And you were running from me in the rain down on Congress Avenue
Now I saw you once in a crowded bar and it was Christmas time
I was frightened by the thunder of our hearts in '69
Because I live my life in whispers now and I choose to live alone
So I slipped back to the avenue and flipped my collar to the cold",So Long Ago

And the snow-capped mountains white
From a distance the ocean meets the stream

It's the voice of every man
From a distance we all have enough
And no one is in need
There are no guns, no bombs, no diseases
No hungry mouths to feed
From a distance we are instruments
Marching in a common band

Playing songs of home, playing songs of peace
They're the songs of every man
God is watching us, God is watching us

From a distance you look like my friend
Even though we are at war
From a distance I can't comprehend
What all this war is for

I would bring you Ireland

If you would keep my heart for me
In the quiet of your Texas days
And my old friend, will you shelter me from pain
In return I'd bring you Ireland

One day I'll build a tower
High upon my Texas plains
I can see from coast to coast
On hot platinum summer days
When the dust is still, and the cotton prays for rain
And the thirsty passers-by wonder why they came

I dreamed of Amarillo
On a foreign night in Dublin
The dust was on my pillow
When the raindrops started falling
In a hotel window, where I could see his rainbow
And I thought I'd send my heart to you
Cause that's the way the wind blows

And I'll reclaim my heart one day
We'll sit and watch your children play

Dance a little closer to me

Dance a little closer tonight

Hey, it's closing time 
And love's on sale
Tonight at this five and dime

I read your warm words from the plains
While the poets say that I should never
Be thinking of you this way

They say that I misread your lines
Because I've been lonely all my life
And I'd be reaching for some silver
And leave my heart out in the fire

I can hear them now ... playin' 'Comin' Through the Rye'
She was dressed in blue and she looked so lovely
just a gentle flower of a small town girl
Then he took her hand and they danced to the music
with a single smile ... she became his world

And they danced all night ... to the fiddle and the banjo
their driftin' tunes, seemed to fill the air
so long ago, but they still remember ...
when they fell in love, at the Roseville Fair
Now, they courted well, and they courted dearly
They'd rock for hours in the front porch chair
Then a year went by ... from the time that he met her
and he made her his, at the Roseville Fair

When the bankers swarm like locust out there turning away our yield
The trains roll by our silos, silver in the rain
They leave our pockets full of nothing
But our dreams and the golden grain

Have you seen the folks in line downtown at the station
They're all buying their ticket out and talking the great depression
Our parents had their hard times fifty years ago
When they stood out in these empty fields in dust as deep as snow

And all this trouble in our fields
If this rain can fall, these wounds can heal
They'll never take our native soil
But if we sell that new John Deere
And then we'll work these crops with sweat and tears
You'll be the mule I'll be the plow
Come harvest time we'll work it out
There's still a lot of love, here in these troubled fields

There's a book up on the shelf about the dust bowl days
And there's a little bit of you and a little bit of me
In the photos on every page
Now our children live in the city and they rest upon our shoulders
They never want the rain to fall or the weather to get colder

Whether it's me that does the leavin or the love that flies away
The moon outside my window looks so lonely tonight

Where are all the dreamers, that I used know?

From the lungs of the young men
In a Deadwood saloon, South Dakota afternoon
And the old ones by the door
With their heads on their chests,
They told lies about whiskey on a womans breath

Yes, and some tell the story of young Mickey Free
Who lost an eye to a buck deer in the Tongue River Valley
Oh and some tell the story of California Joe
Who sent word through the Black Hills
There was a mountain of gold

And the gold she lay cold in their pockets
And the sun she sets down on the trees
And they thank the Lord
For the land that they live in
Where the white man does as he pleases

Some flat-shoed fool from the East comes a-runnin'
With some news that he'd read in some St. Joseph paper
And it was Drinks all around cause the news he was tellin'
Was the one they called Crazy
Has been caught and been dealt with

And the Easterner he read the news from the paper
And the old ones moved closer so's they could hear better
Well it says here that Crazy Horse
Was killed while trying to escape,
And that was some time last September,
It don't give the exact date

Where the white man does as he pleases
Then the talk turned back to whiskey and women
And cold nights on the plains, Lord
And fightin' them indians
And the Easterner he says he'll have one more
Fore he goes
He gives the paper to the Crow boy
Who sweeps up the floor

Oh, and did they really see you out there laughing at us all

[Chorus:]
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Oh, were you really out there laughing at us all?

The midnight boy from Minnesota shut you down and stole the show
They say that you bitter in your anguish
Cause it was you they ought to hold
You wore your causes on your sleeve like a beacon wears the dark
It's only right you should be out there laughing at us all

Now you are only dust for art
You're a shadow to recall
For all those late night drinkers in their ragged lonely bars
And we all said you'd never make it cuz you had that fragile heart
Now, all our hearts you held are wasted
You're out there laughing at us all

Nanci Griffith,"What've you got to say for yourself now, baby, now that I am leaving you, 
What have you got to lose?
The truth you tried to keep from me, 
Well, it nearly drove me crazy, 
And I have grown weary from sleepless nights of you.

Is that a broken heart in the corner of your eye, 
Something to remind you?
You made this love a teardrop waiting to fall.  
There are those who can't love right. I just can't love wrong.
When you are lonely in the night,
 how I hope you will recall you made this love a teardrop waiting to fall.

No, I will not forgive you betraying trust between us, 
Though I will always care for you.
I have loved you half my life, and when I give my heart again,
I know that I'll remember love is but a fragile flame and trust just fuels the fire.

When I think of all the years your love has taken from me, 
I can't believe I'm leaving you.
You made this love a teardrop waiting to fall. 
There are those who can't love right. 
I just can't love wrong.

When you are lonely in the night, 
How I hope you will recall you made this love a teardrop waiting to fall.
You made this love a teardrop waiting to fall.

Nanci Griffith,"I once was a lot like you
We share a dream I couldn't make come true
I was a child who wrote my name
Across a frosted window pane

And there are jobs that I might hold
If they'd just let me through the door
Without a shower and new clothes
That I can ill afford

[Chorus:]
Can you spare the time?
Can you spare a dime?
Can you look me in the eye?
I'm down 'n' out
And I am lonely
Do you ever think of me on
Sunday?
No. I don't live
Across the water
Hey, I live right here
On this corner
Just a bank account away from
America

I won't hurt your family
I don't want a house there on your street
And I know you think that I'm
As lazy as a hobo's sigh
Now, you call me down 'n' outer
If there's a way out
I've not found 'er
I only want to earn my piece of America

Nanci Griffith,"I am fragile in the morning
I grow stronger in the day
I can sprint like a new spring doe
By the fall of the night
Love has chased me down
Through the cities and the towns
Until I stood beside the road
And let it pass me by
Like a fool I've missed the rain
Cause I was crying

[Chorus:]
Then you are calling
Call my heart awake from years of slumber
And then I'm falling
Like a child head over heel
In fields of summer
Can you hold me?
Though I am inclined to
Leave my home and wander
Can you keep me,
Like a child head over heel
In fields of summer?
Fields of summer
Fields of summer
I am falling
Like a child head over heel
In fields of summer

Now that you have caught me
Are you sure you really want me?
Though I'm fragile as December
On your shoulder in the dawn
And when the day has made me stronger,
Can you satisfy my hunger?
When the night has come and I would race the moon
Across the sky,
Would you chase me through
Those open fields of summer

Can you hold me?
Hold me?
Hold me?
Because I'm falling,

And a friend is still a friend
I need a hometown street where the love you're given
Surely comes back 'round again

With faces that you've always known
But, you'll never see them

But we will still be here

Do you miss me when I'm far away?
Do you save me for your rainy days?

With your tool case by the roadside
There beneath the power lines
Or the pallor of your skin
Paled beneath fluorescent lights
In a Greyhound station's cruel midnight
Where you can't afford the ride

[Chorus:]
Oh, the power lines
They go from sea to sea
They carry voices
Love from him to me

Are the rainbows you can't climb
And you will not climb the power lines
You are lost beneath the power lines
There's no place that you haven't been
And no place that you call your home
There's no place that you cannot go

And the tools to build another's dream
That connects them to the power lines
You do not feel you need

Nanci Griffith,"Never saw the morning till I stayed up all night
Never saw the sunshine till I turned out the light
Never saw my home town till I stayed away too long
I never heard the melody till I needed the song

Never saw the white line till I was leavin' you behind
Never knew I needed you till I was caught up in a bind
And I never spoke I love you till I cursed you in vain
Never felt my heart strings until I nearly went insane

Never saw the East coast until I moved to the West
I never saw the moonlight till it shone off your breast
And I never saw your heart till someone tried to steal it away
Never saw your tears till they rolled down your face

I never saw the morning till I stayed up all night
Never saw the sunshine till you turned out the light
Never saw my home town till I stayed away too long
I never heard the melody till I needed the song

Nanci Griffith,"I've been walkin' in my sleep
Countin' troubles 'stead of countin' sheep
Where the years went I can't say
I just turned around and they've gone away

I've been siftin' through the layers
Of dusty books and faded papers
They tell a story I used to know
And it was one that happened so long ago

It's gone away in yesterday
Now I find myself on the mountainside
Where the rivers change direction
Across the Great Divide

Now, I hear the owl a-callin'
Softly as the night was fallin'
With a question and I replied
But he's gone across the borderline

It's gone away in yesterday
Now I find myself on the mountainside
Where the rivers change direction
Across the Great Divide

The finest hour that I have seen
Is the one that comes between
The edge of night and the break of day
It's when the darkness rolls away

It's gone away in yesterday

It's a hot and heavy load
And the folks I meet ain't always kind
Some are bad and some are good
Some have done the best they could
Some have tried to ease my trouble in mind

And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound
Where I'm bound
I can't help but wonder where I'm bound

I've been wandering through this land
Just doin' the best I can
Tryin' to find what I was meant to do
And the people that I see
Look as worried as can be
And it looks like they are wanderin', too

And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound
Where I'm bound
I can't help but wonder where I'm bound

And I had me a buddy back home
But he started out to roam
And I hear, he's out by Frisco Bay
And, sometimes when I've had a few
His old voice comes ringin' through
And I'm goin' out to see him some old day

If you see me passin' by
And you sit and you wonder why
And you wish that you were a rambler, too
Just nail your shoes to the kitchen floor
Lace 'em up and bar the door
Thank your stars for the roof that's over you

It almost breaks my heart when I think of my family
I told them I'd be coming home with my pockets full of green

The only time I feel alright is when I'm into drinking

I dream I see white horses dance upon that other ocean

Why do you rope for short pay?

Nanci Griffith,"The name she gave was Caroline
Daughter of a miner
And her ways were free and it seemed to me
The sunshine walked beside her

She came to Spencer, across the hill
She said her pa had sent her
'Cause the coal was low and soon the snow
Would turn the skies to winter

She said she's come to look for work
She was not seeking favors
For a dime a day and a place to stay
She'd turn those hands to labor

But the times were hard Lord, and the jobs were few
All through Tecumseh Valley
But she asked around and a job she found
Tending bar at Gypsy Sally's

She saved enough to get back home
When spring replaced the winter
But her dreams were denied, her pa had died
The word come down from Spencer

So she turned a whorin' out on the streets
With all the lust inside her
And it was many a man returned again
To lay himself beside her

They found her down beneath the stairs
That led to Gypsy Sally's
In her hand when she died was a note that cried
Fare thee well, Tecumseh Valley

The name she gave was Caroline
Daughter of a miner
And her ways were free and it seemed to me

He was standing by the highway
With a sign that just said Mother
When he heard a driver coming
About a half a mile away
So he held the sign up higher
Where no decent soul could miss it
It was ten degrees or colder
Down by Boulder Dam that day

He was raised up in Milwaukee
Though he never was that famous
He was just a road musician
To the taverns he would go
Singing songs about the ramblin'
The lovin' girls and gamblin'
How the world fell on his shoulders
Back in Boulder I don't know

Chorus
And she told him she would take him
For a ride in the morning sun
Back in Boulder he had told her
I don't know when, I've had a better friend

It was out in Arizona
That he heard the lady listening
To each word that he was saying
To each line that he would write
So he sat down at her table
And they talked about the weather
98.6 and rising down by Boulder Dam that night

Chorus

Now he's traded off his Martin
Though his troubles ain't over
His feet are almost frozen and the sun is sinking low

That's when we stood in line
Waiting for our soup
Swallowing our pride

This old town should've burn down in 1931
When the rain refused to come
Air filled up our bellies, dust filled up our lungs
And we thought our time had come

This old town was built by hand
In the dust bowl of the motherland
There must be rock beneath this sand
Oh' I'll be damned, this town still stands

This old town should've burned down in 1944
When the last men went to war
They came back different
If they came back at all

This old town should've burned down in 1956
That's when the twister hit
And all our hopes were buried
Beneath the boards and bricks
And we almost called it quits

This old town was built by hand
In the dust bowl of the motherland
There must be rock beneath this sand
Oh' I'll be damned, this town still stands

Somewhere in the distance
The city lights do shine
The sidewalks gleam with neon dreams
That call from time to time

When my children's children
Ask me why didn't I go
They say the heart of any town
Is the people that you've known
They'll always call you home

In the dust bowl of the motherland
There must be rock beneath this sand

Nanci Griffith,"He was a flyer for the Air Force
On a plane from San Antonio
I was traveling to London
He was going off to Buffalo
Changing planes in Pittsburgh
We got grounded in a storm
Now, I would give anything
To be on that flyer's arm

We played cards, mostly blackjack
As we sat out on the tarmac
We sang songs we knew in Spanish
As we both loved songs of language
He'd heard me on the radio
I'd seen the flyers on San Antone
Now, I would give anything
To have that flyer for my own

God bless the flyer
Who would be flying home tonight
I would give anything
To see that flyer, flyin' tonight

He said he'd never married
Cause, his heart was in the clouds
And I said I was too clumsy 
That I broke the wings of the loves I found
He shouted out his name to me
As I ran to make my flight
Now, I would give anything
To see that flyer, flyin' tonight

One year I watched a war in London
In the airport leaving London
And I wondered if I'd know him 
If I saw his wings in motion
Did I leave my heart in Pittsburgh
In the lightening of that flight?
I wish that you could tell me now
Will he be flyin' home tonight?

God bless the flyer
Who would be flying home tonight
I would give anything
To see that flyer, flyin' tonight

God bless the flyer
Who would be flying home tonight
I would give anything
To see that flyer, flyin' tonight",The Flyer
Nanci Griffith,"I look out on these shields of heather
Across this countryside
I wonder how they've grown together
While people live such separate lives
I think I'll stay inside for the winter
Cause the weather's in my bones
And the wind could shatter bone to splinter
Then howl me back home
 
[Chorus:]
I'm fragile as the lady of the harbour
Fragile as her torch that glows
Fragile as these gulf stream waters
To the Texas coast
To the Texas coast

I stared up at the faces in the mountain
Just a year ago
Laughin' in the spirit of America
And singin' in the snow
Now I wish I felt as strong as that mountain
Just carved in stone
I wish I was the gulf stream water
And I could sail you home

[Chorus]

I would give you all that's in me
Though part of me is gone
If I could have that day upon the mountain
For the snow and the song
But here's to love and all that it changes
When you're alone out in that storm
Cause' if I'd had a shield of heather
I'd have never loved at all

I would sail you home
To the Texas coast
I would sail you home

Nanci Griffith,"Flippin' bottle caps through the ring around the moon
All alone on a Saturday night with the stars in bloom
I am a vision of my mother's dream come true
Built this house out in the hills
All by my own will
I've got love enough for two
But it's just me and this old moon

[Chorus:]
And the sailors on the water
They all want the captain's daughter
They want her beauty and her youth
To grace their bow out on the sea
Me, I'm getting older and I'm plain
As plain can be
Got a bank full of mother's dreams
Maybe mother just didn't see
That love would be the only thing
Her daughter would ever need

Oh, I am the heart not taken
The one thought not worth breakin'
I am the late blooming rose
With only her mother's dream to hold
On this less travelled road
Who really knows
Maybe the hearts not taken
Are truly made of gold

I'm gonna flip one more bottle cap up at the moon
I've got an early call with so much work to do
But, when I go inside I'm gonna let my back door slam
Mother, to tell you the truth
I would trade your dream away
Just to hear some loved one say
I love you, too

Nobody's angel now

The one who can't love wrong
The one who won't fall

Who listens with pen in hand
I'm everyone's shoulder
Till it's me who falls down

Nanci Griffith,"On Grafton Street at Christmas time
The elbows push you 'round
This is not my place of memories
I'm a stranger in this town
The faces seem familiar
And I know those songs they're playin'
But I close my eyes and find myself
Five thousand miles away

[Chorus:]
It's funny how my world goes round without you
You're the one thing I never thought
I could live without
And I just found this smile to think about you
You're a Saturday night
Far from the madding crowd

The buskers sing by candle light
In front of Bewleys Store
A young nun offers me a chair
At a table by the door
And I feel compelled to tell her
Of the sisters that we knew
How when they lit their candles
I'd say a prayer for you

[Chorus]

The church bells ring for holy hour
And I'm back out in the rain
It's been twenty years or more
Since I last said your name
I hear you live near Dallas now
In a house out on the plains
Why Grafton Street brought you to mind
I really can't explain

Is it just because you know that's what I want to hear?
Lately friends are warning me
What they hesitate to tell me leaves a thread of fear

And when the final truth comes down
There's only one thing left to do
It's come back 'round to you
(come back 'round to you)

[Chorus:]
Say it isn't so
Tell me that you're someone
I'll believe in
Am I the last to know
That you don't love me anymore?

Oh, if you ever did
Say it isn't so
Am I caught up in a web
That you are weaving?
Oh, the stories I've been told
Indicate that you're already
Reachin' for the door

It's just a lovers situation
Are you in or out of love?
I've heard those words before
I've had to face up to the truth
'cause' staying and pretending
Would have hurt him more

Sometimes they leave too soon

Staring at the sky
I'm thinking of my childhood
And I'm trying not to cry
While a stranger sleeps against me
And it feels like I'm his wife
Towns and cities flutter past
Like the pages of my life
My heart is on the baggage rack
It's heavy as can be

I wish that I could find someone
Who would carry it for me
Just to pay it some attention
And to handle it with care
Because it has been dropped
And is in need of some repair

[Chorus:]
Some things I know
Some things I guess
Some things I wish that I could learn
To express
Like the way that I feel
As I stare at the sky
And I remember your voice
And the sound, of goodbye

Maybe it's the autumn chill
Maybe it's the rain
Maybe I should wake the stranger
And ask him his name
But, my eyes they would betray me
And my words could not defend
No, I must learn to wait my turn
Before I love again

You told me in the dark while I was sleeping
Then you slept through the sunrise
As it washed across your face
And all that I had heard were our hearts beating

While this love has a voice that we both
Can hear
Before you let it go,
The greatest love I've ever known

I cannot find a place to put this love away
Or lose the thought of sunlight on your face

And put this silence in my heart in a better place

That I see you in the shadows
In hotel rooms and headlights
You're coming up beside me
Whether it's day or night

These days my life is an open book
Missing pages I cannot seem to find
These days your face
In my memory
Is in a folded hand of grace against these times

No one's ever come between your memory and me
I have driven this weary vessel here alone
Will you still find me if I leave you here beside this road
Cause I need someone who can touch me
Who'll put no one above me
Someone who needs me
Like the air he breathes

I can't remember where this toll road goes
Maybe it's Fort Worth, maybe it's a heart of gold

That I've lived my life in the back roads
With your love in my pocket
If I spend the love you gave me
Tell me where will it go?

This heart hit the sidewalk wonderin'
Why you left it on

Was stuck out in a blizzard in it's summer clothes

When the love comes
And when it goes

Could you see my heart beside you?

Could this naked love survive the light of day

Where the Walker runs down into the Carson Valley plain
There lived a young maiden Darcy Farrow was her name
The daughter of old Dundee and a fair one was she
The sweetest flower that bloomed o'er the range

She was courted by young Vandermeer
And quite handsome was he I am to hear
He brought her silver rings and lacy things
And they promised to marry before the snows came that year

But her pony did stumble and she did fall
Her dyin' touched the hearts of us, one and all
Young Vandy in his pain put a bullet in his brain
And we buried them together as the snows began to fall

They sing of Darcy Farrow where the Truckee runs through
They sing of her beautyin Virginia City too
At dusty sundown to her name they drink a round
And to young Vandy whose love was true

Where the Walker runs down into the Carson Valley plain
There lived a young maiden Darcy Farrow was her name
The daughter of old Dundee and a fair one was she
The sweetest flower that bloomed o'er the range

The oranges are stacked
In their Creosote dumps
They're flying them back
To that Mexico border
To pay all their wages
To wade back again

Goodbye to you Juan, goodbye Rosalita
Adios mis amigos, Jesus and Maria
You won't have a name
When you ride the big airplane
All they will call you
Will be deportee

He waded that river
They took all the money
He made in his life

Come working the fruit trees
And they rode on the trucks
'Til they took down and died

Like rustlers, like thieves

We died in your hills
And we died in your deserts
We died in your valleys
We died on your plains
We died 'neath your trees
And we died in your bushes
Both sides of that river
We died just the same

Over Los Gatos Canyon
Like a fireball of lightning
And shook all our hills
Who are all those friends
All scattered like dry leaves
The radio says
They are just deportees

We can grow our best orchards?
Is this the best way
We can grow our good fruit?
To fall like dry leaves
And rot on my topsoil
And beknown by no name
Except deportee

And he'd sit out in the kitchen and cry
And run his fingers through seventy years of livin'
And wonder, ""Lord, has ever' well I've drilled run dry?""

We were friends, me and this old man
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

He's a drifter and a driller of oil wells
And an old school man of the world
He let me drive his car
When he's too drunk to

And he'd wink and give me money for the girls
And our lives were like some old western movie
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

From the time that I could walk he'd take me with him
To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe
There were old men with beer guts and dominos
Lying 'bout their lives while they'd played

And I was just a kid
They all called his ""Sidekick""
Like desperados waitin' for a train

One day I looked up and he's pushin' eighty
And there's brown tobacco stains all down his chin
To me he's one of the heroes of this country
So why's he all dressed up like them old men

Drinkin' beer and playin' Moon and Forty-two
Like desperados waitin' for a train

A day before he died, I went to see him

Who lives with hate and loving him in mind

We left our kin and all our friends back there in Tennessee
I bought those one way tickets, she had often begged me for
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore

Her heart was filled with laughter, when she saw those city lights
She said, ""The prettiest place on earth is Baltimore at night""
Oh well a man feels proud to give his woman, what she's longing for
And I kind of liked the streets of Baltimore

Well I got myself a factory job, I ran an old machine
I bought a little cottage in a neighborhood serene
Yet every night when I came home with every muscle sore
She would drag me through the streets of Baltimore

Well I did my best to bring her back to what she used to be
But I soon learned she loved those bright lights
Much more than she loved me

That brought me here before

I packed up my suitcase
Pulled down my old bedroll
And I started to wander
Far from my home
And the time it passed quickly
And the days seemed to be hours
Far from your city
And Yarrington Town

Well, I wandered through the midnights
Of sea-bordered bar lights
And I wandered through the forests
As deep as the sea
But I never got lonesome
Until I'd hear a sad song
One to remind me of Yarrington Town

Well, I followed a miner
To his home in the North woods
And he promised to love me
As long as I'd stay
And I even saw lightning
Touch a stone in the mine field
Could not touch the lightning
In Yarrington Town

So I packed up my suitcase
I pulled out my old bedroll
And I started to wander
On back to my home

And the days seemed to be years

It rang her ""From A Distance"" just like it was my own
I'd pretend I've the voice of Beth Neilsen Chapman
I wrote 'Late Night Grande' with just my right hand happenin'

Now it's keys rent the air in it's new place to stand
A gift for the children who'll play right and left hand
Just a 1937 Pre-war Kimball
Oh, with the grace of that three-quarter grand
Oh, the grace of that three-quarter grand

Oh, it's lonesome in this corner at five am
I'd call Harlan Howard, only he'd understand
All those melodies that came to be
Mornings in this corner, that piano and me

And I wished for the left hand like Glenn D. Hardin
I could play Jimmy Webb or perhaps Randy Newman
Ah, it's a blessing, it never met Jerry Lee's feet
Just the hands of those children is all this Kimball needs

I'll let it go, let it go
That piano I bought from Al Jones long ago
I've let it go, I've let it go
And I smiled as it rolled out my door
And the songs that we wrote, ah, note for note
That piano will always know

Now it's keys rent the air in it's new place to stand
A gift for the children who'll play right and left hand
Just a 1937 Pre-war Kimball
Oh, the grace of that three-quarter grand
Oh, the grace of that three-quarter grand
Oh, it's the grace of that three-quarter grand

And God bless the child

Nanci Griffith,"The drops from the faucet like a nervous heart
Beat on my porcelain sink a rhythm avant-garde
I page through the phone book, reach for my fountain pen
Is he comin' in for the holidays to haunt me again?
I call up the Grand Central, ""information please.
Is that nickel line on time? Oh fine!""
It's a hair-do with a wave
We both forgot and forgave last time

A peddler of pots and pans down on Union Square
Said City Hall wants us off the street
There's no Christmas in the air
Some high-brows were waiting
Carnation bright lapels
Their big cars line the curbs outside those grand hotels
I passed a marquee, Third Avenue
""Ramona"" with Loretta Young and I swung myself around
And (headed) uptown to the train

So this is New Year's eve another year has passed
We wait so patiently, (but) still they come and go so fast
I stand on this platform, wait for that basket of light
And the sound of the whistle screamin' out
Like some hot trumpet in the night
And, as I'm waitin' I wonder why and where,
And what went wrong
But this song don't tell no lies
It was just a quick good-bye, yeah",Drops from the Faucet
Nanci Griffith,"Rita was sixteen years
Hazel eyes and chestnut hair
She made the Woolworth counter shine

And Eddie was a sweet romancer
And a darn good dancer
And they waltzed the aisles of the five and dime

[Chorus:]
And they'd sing
Dance a little closer to me
Hey, dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight

Dance a little closer to me
Hey, it's closing time 
And love's on sale
Tonight at this five and dime

Eddie played the steel guitar
And his mama cried 'cause he played in the bars
And he kept young Rita out late at night

Soon they married up in Abelene
Lost a child in Tennessee
But still that love survived

[Chorus]

One of the boys in Eddie's band
Took a shine to Rita's hand
So , Eddie ran off with the bass man's wife

Oh, but he was back by June
Singin' a different tune
Sporting Miss Rita back by his side

[Chorus]

Eddie played in the barroom band
'Til arthritis took his hands
Now he sells insurance on the side

When I am reminded of all we've been through
Such a blue moon shining
Does it ever shine down on you?

Like I'm the only one whose getting up from a fall
Don't you remember, can't you recall?

Nanci Griffith,"I am a clock without hands
I'm walking through the midnights
Counting all the moments
Of the loves I've left behind
Crying on the shoulders of the days
I've not forgotten now

I am frozen in time
Like the battles of the soldiers
Left displaced of time 
Where their tears still fall
Loves that wreck out on the track
Far beyond my looking back to recall
I'm just a clock upon the shelf
Without hands to give the time of day
For love at all

[Chorus:]
I am a clock without hands
No one understands this
That when the autumn comes
I see no reason for a fall
Spring can fail to move me
With its tulips and its clover
Now the time for love is over
I am a clock without hands
I'm just tickin' and that's all
I am a clock without hands
I'm just tickin' and that's all

I recall a time 
When love still had the power
To reach inside this clock
Where my hands held a dream
The innocence of passion
And the words of Saint Teresa chiming in 
And I recall the faith
Of the love of my life
And the losing of my hands
Which he took with him when he died
I'm crying on the shoulders of his love
That I'm remembering now
It's been ages since this heart has ticked a beat of love
So I've forgotten how

Are you weak or are you strong?

With the wife of my best pal,

Off to see Mount Rushmore,
Staring through the snow.
And to gamble with the boys of Deadwood as we drove.

So a swimsuit I adorned.

And brand new plastic skates.
Out into the snow to catch this cold,

What's that I feel now beating in my heart

I've felt that beat before
What's that I feel beating in my heart
I feel it more and more
It's the rumble of freedom calling

Climbing up to the sky
It's the rumble of the old ways falling
You can feel it if you try
You can feel it if you try

It's the sound of freedom calling
You can hear it if you try",What's That I Hear
Nanci Griffith,"There's a star in Heaven's sky
Always shining bright
It's just a tear in an angel's eye
A gentle guiding light

[Chorus:]
Let it shine on me
Let it show the way
Let it always be
Let it always stay
Let it flood my soul
Let it hold the key
Let it all unfold
Let it shine on me

When the way seems so dark
Let it shine on me
Bringing home within my heart
A reason to believe

[Chorus x 2]",Let It Shine on Me
Nancy Sinatra,"Some people run
Some people crawl
Some people don't even move at all

Some roads lead forward
Some roads lead back
Some roads are bathed in white
Some wrapped in fearful black

Time, oh time
Where did you go?
Time, oh good good time
Where did you go?

Some people never get
And some never give
Some people never die
But some never live

Some folks they treat me mean
Some treat me kind
But most folks just go their way
Don't pay me no mind

Time, oh time
Where did you go?
Time, oh good good time
Where did you go?

Sometimes I'm satisfied
Sometimes I'm not
Sometimes my face is cold
(Shot Me Down)
Sometimes it's hot

At sunset I laugh
But at sunrise I cry
At midnight I'm in between
And wondering why

Time, oh time
Where did you go?
Time, oh good good time
Where did you go?",Until It's Time for You to Go
Nancy Sinatra,"At the end of the rainbow
You'll find a pot of gold
At the end of a story
You'll find it's all been told
But our love has a treasure
Our hearts can always spend
And it has a story without any end

At the end of a river
The water stops it's flow
At the end of a highway
There's no place you can go
But just tell me you love me
And you are only mine
And our love will go on
Till the end of time
Till the end of time",The End
Nancy Sinatra,"Cold, cold, cold, cold, it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail

Somebody help me please 
I'm as helpless as I can be
And I don't know what my life is comin' to
Now they say that I shot a man 
Well I never shot I ran
And that was my first mistake I'm telling you

Ah it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail, it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail
Well it's cold, cold, cold, cold, it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail

I got a man in Wichita and a man in Saginaw
And they both ain't heard from me in some time
I hate to disappoint them both but some feller under oath
Said I did it and they believed his story not mine

Ah it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail, it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail
Well it's cold, cold, cold, cold, it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail

There's snow all over the ground 
And there ain't one robin around, that I'd trust to carry a message to a friend
I guess I'll just stay here till spring 
I sure wish I knew what spring
They'd let me out so I can start again

Ah it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail, yeah it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail
Well it's cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail

Well it's cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail",Hutchinson Jail
Nancy Sinatra,"I have tried to make you love me 
I've done everything your way
And I'm crying for the words you'll never say
You think love is an illusion
That must end in sad conclusion
If that's what you feel that's just how it will be
And I can't grow peaches on a cherry tree

When I see the peaches blossom
I'll regret I said goodbye
I remember cherry kisses and I'll cry
But I can't go on pretending
That our love is never ending
For you can't be loved unless you want to be
And I can't grow peaches on a cherry tree

Someday I will find a new love
But for you there can be no love
For you can't be loved unless you want to be
And I can't grow peaches on a cherry tree

Nancy Sinatra,"[Getting stoned on sunshine, getting high on air,]
Getting to it naturally, really getting there,
[Getting such a high on, loving what I do,]
I'm so full of happiness, my hope's on something new,

[Each day on earth is a day that's worth remembering]
(remembering, remembering).

[My pot is filled with flowers, my grass is bright and
green,]

I've got to fly my own sweet way, and don't you shoot me down.

Nancy Sinatra,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try",The More I See You
Nancy Sinatra,"They say the neon lights are bright
On Broadway 
They say there's always magic in the air 
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't have enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere

They say the women treat you fine
On Broadway 
But lookin' at them just gives me the blues 
How ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes
 
They say that I won't last too long 
On Broadway 
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home they all say 
But they get wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar

I won't quit till I'm a star
On Broadway 
On Broadway

Nancy Sinatra,"These shades can hide the teardrops crying
But not the way I feel inside
These shades can only do their part oh yeah
But these shades can't hide a broken heart
These shades can hide my red red eyes
But not the hurt left by your lies
These shades can only do their part oh yeah
But these shades can't hide a broken heart
Dark shades I'll keep on wearin' as long as I'm still caryin'
For you and I still love you so oh why did you go now
These shades can hide my eyes away
But not the pain I feel each day
These shades can only do their part oh yeah

Nancy Sinatra,"Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things

I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled to
A song that I had only sang to just a few
She saw my silver spurs and said let's pass some time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oh, oh summer wine

Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oh, oh summer wine

My eyes grew heavy and my lips they could not speak
I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet
She reassured me with an unfamiliar line
And then she gave to me more summer wine
Oh, oh summer wine

Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Mmm-mm summer wine

When I woke up the sun was shining in my eyes
My silver spurs were gone, my head felt twice its size
She took my silver spurs, a dollar and a dime
And left me cravin' for more summer wine
Oh, oh summer wine

Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you my summer wine",Summer Wine
Nancy Sinatra,"There's a little bird that somebody sent
Down to the earth to live on the wind
Going on the wind and he sleeps on the wind
This little bird that somebody sent

He's light and fragile and feathered sky blue
So thin and graceful the sun shines through
This little bird who lives on the wind
This little bird that somebody sent

He flies so high up in the sky
Way out of reach of human eye
And the only time that he touches the ground
Is when that little bird
Is when that little bird
Is when that little bird dies
",This Little Bird
