Snow,"[Yami Bolo]
It´s been so long We´ve been in captivity
People wishing one day to be free

[Snow]
Waiting to see the day when freedom will come
Mama working hard in the burning sun
I wish the world were truly happy living as one living as one
Wish the word they call freedom one day would come
I may bee just a foolish dreamer
But I don´t care

[Yami Bolo]
Freedom rushes freely trough the air

[Chorus]
Freedom more freedom don´t turn them down don´t turn them down
Freedom more freedom don´t turn us down don´t turn us down

[Snow]
Although they´ve no love for Humanity 

[Yami Bolo]
How could you ever sell your brother man in slavery

[Snow]
In word of injustice crimes and poverty
Organize and set your lives in one I-nity was meant to be

[Yami Bolo]
Overcome material gain petty prejudice system
Too long poor people have been the victim
I wish that one day when freedom comes
For each and every man to see the morning sun

Snow,"[CHORUS] 
If this world were mine, I'd play a rub a dub all the time 
Oh girl you would be mine, keeping per perfect time 
If this world were mine, I'd play a rub a dub all the time 
Oh girl you would be mine, keeping per perfect time 

It was a lonely afternoon I took a walk that day 
And there she was up in the park could it one same way 
She was wearing something oh that I cannot mention 
Just to get my attention 
I said I'm running no game what is your name 
Do you understand what I say 
Are you confused by the words that I choose 
And if you are should I slow down 
So io so io so io an manyana 
Young girl listen to what I say 

[CHORUS] 
You got me movin' you got me groovin' make me feel much younger 
Say even is the bag she got me bubbling under 
Make me pray to God when you roll like thunder 
The heat from your body make it hot like fire 
Say there's no other girl that can quench my desire 
Now if you had the same you wouldn't call me a liar 
She makes me high, so high 

[CHORUS] 
I only want to rub a dub with you baby, you know I love you 
I only want to rub a dub with you baby, all the time 
want to get with you but I want to be your play toy 
Venture into something new 
want to kiss your sweet lips touch in the sun dips 
Tell me what you want to do 
Whatcha gonna do...

Snow,"I led a hard life 
Dust in the wind 
I led a hard life 
I led a hard life 

Close my eyes 
Only for a moment 
And the moment's gone 
All we do 
Crumbles to the ground 
And we refuse to see 

Dust in the wind 
All we are is dust in the wind 

I led a hard life (Repeat) 

Same old sound 
Just a drop of water 
In an endless sea 
In all you do 
And not another minute 
Oh no, no more goodbye, bye, bye 

CHORUS 
Dust in the wind 
All we are is dust in the wind 
Dust in the wind 
All we are is dust in the wind 

I led a hard life (Repeat) 
?? 
?wonder 
I don't know 
What about? 
And we stick it assunder 
Out of coming up in this world 
And it's bringing me under 
And as I can make it this far 
I know just who we are 
We must be dust 

CHORUS & fade with the following: 
I led a hard life (repeat) 

",Hard Life
Snow,"Informer, you no say 
That's who I'm gonna blame 
A likky boom boom down 
Detective man said Daddy Snow 
I stabbed someone down the lane 
A licky boom boom down 
Informer, you no say 
That's who I'm gonna blame 
A licky boom boom down 
Detective man said daddy snow 
I stabbed someone down the lane 
A licky boom boom down 


Police them come and they blow down my door 
One him a crawl through my windo 
There is something you must really know 
I'm born and reaised in the ghetto 
That's all I want you to know 
Pure black people is all that I know 
My shoes used to tear up and my toes used to show 
Never let them show 
But never let Informer, him know 

(*repeat) 

The bigger they are 
They think they have more power 
They're on the phone 
Me say on every hour 
I said I want to use it once 
To call my lover 
Lover who I'm going to call 
It is still Tamei 
I lover her from my heart 
Down to my belly 

(*repeat) 

Watch my girl, watch my girl 
Come with a nice young lady 
Intelligent, yes she's gentle and irie 

Everywhere I go, I've never left her at all 
Yes, me Snow roam the dance 
Roam the dance in every nation 
You'll never know, me daddy Snow 
I am the boom Shakata 
I'll never lay down flat in one cardboard box 
Yes, me Daddy Snow 
I'm gonna reach the top, so? 

(mc shan part) 
If you analyze my style you'll see I'm pure breed Rotweiller 
And we could go line per line and match that dollar for dollar 
I seems that I spit a luggie every time that I spit 
And as the balls flow by it seems the grittier it gets 
And in this game you gotta choose between your pride and your chips 
Who rides in your whiz and what slides from your lips 
And if my shit was any hotter my lungs would combust and explode 
And they say the man of steel would never rust and corrode 
And still I don't like no Informer

Whiplash freaky music accident 
You look sweet

Raindrops rollin' down the windowpane 
Just can't leave you standin' in the rain 
We got frozen like the novacaine 
But just can't believe it 

Sit back, feels just like I live a dream 
Get stacked foolin with the?. 
In fact, we pump it up 
'Cause we just like to hear it 

(*Repeat 2 times) 

Hip hop singin' to a reggae tune 
No more lonely Monday afternoons 
And I'd? 
'cause you just like to hear it 

Sometimes I just wanna hide away 
If not for my little baby jane 
And I keep singin' songs 
'cause she just likes to hear it

Snow,"Say hello, hello, hello 
Say hello, hello, hello 

Wish that I was just a kid 
I'd find some place to play 
The world around us 
Seems to drown us on a slow decay 
I close my eyes 
Imagine floating out to sea 
Not a sound for miles around 
The only man was me 

CHORUS 1 
Still there ain't no use 
I'm gettin' it sideways 
It's nothin' at all 
I'm getting' it my way 
Keep imagining cars 
Up in the driveway 
I'm hittin' the highway 

CHORUS 2 
How can you knock it 
You're getting' by 
You can do anything 
If you try 

The things I did when I was a kid 
I wish would go away 
Be who you are that's who you'll be 
That's what I always say 
My life's an open book 
For all the world to see 
I don't bother you but yet 
You throw your dirt at me

",You Can Do Anything
Snow,"Every time I see your face
My heart begins to race
I guess it's all right to say
You've got a lovin' biological reaction on me

Don't know what happens to me
But ever time I see you, baby
It's hard to understand
I feel a change in my body

My legs begin to tremble and I can't walk up
My throat becomes dry and I can't talk up
My palms get wet and I can't touch up
And I can't believe

My body temperature begins to rise
My eyes feel like they've been hypnotized
I feel so numb like I'm paralyzed
You do this to me

Every time I see your face
My heart begins to race
I guess it's all right to say
You've got a lovin' biological reaction on me

Every time you come around
My stomach makes a sound
I guess it's all right to say
You've got a lovin' biological reaction on me

My friends they just laugh at me
They don't understand what happens to me
I know I seem like a fool
There's just no way I can play it cool

My legs begin to tremble and I can't walk up
My throat becomes dry and I can't talk up

Must be your thighs when you walk
The way they switch on ya

On the real ma
I'm intimidated by you
I've been with mucho models
They can't compete with you

I all want to do is walk up and talk to you
I all want to do is write up my math for you

Snow,"Baby I got, no need to worry
No need to feel 
No need to be alone alone alone again,
Do you know why, 
Cause I'm around girl

I can see the sadness in your eyes, oh my...
I can see the teardrops crying why, oh why... 

I remember them days alone
Oh so long ago
And I had this really silly crush on you
But I hoped you'd never know

When you were sitting on your doorstep
Wearing shoes that you've outgrown
Trying really really hard just 2 impress you
But you would turn on your radio
(your favorite song you'd play)

She would always laugh at me
But I would take it
'Cause I thought she would make it
But all this time, it's been killing me
So I sing...
Ooo-ahh-na-na-na...

I can see the sadness in your eyes, oh my...
I can see the teardrops crying why, oh why... 
I can see the sadness in your eyes, oh my...
I can see those teardrops crying why, oh why... 

I double-rode you down 2 that secret place
The only world we could be alone
And the sun had hid it's face from you
Where we'd usually laugh and be skipping stones

You would tell me about your family
How they'd never-ever seen to get along
And pretending it don't hurt you
But the clouds told me somethings wrong...
(she didn't want to say)

Wanted a life that could not be
But she would fake it
Until she would make it
Still all this time, it's been killing me
So we sing...

Snow,"I used to sit and wish for all this stuff before
Now I got it & don't want the shit no more
Never had a girlfriend when I was living poor
So who the hell are these women knocking at my door

I'm through with these so called friends of mine
Cause no one was around when I was doing time
No one ever called or send a dime
None of these fakes drop me a line

Snow will survive this fucked-up game
I'll live to see my enemies bow in shame

Cause that's my life

First I got the money 
Then I get the drama
Tired of the hating
Be careful of the karma
Then I got the baby
Never loved the mamma
Screw them all the haters
I don't need the trauma

It's always about me doing for you
What you don't think I got problems too
Never see you when I'm broke and need a few
But you always find me when your rent is due

Sit back shut your mouth I got something to say
Everything I used to do I'm gonna change today
Why you only call me when you need my car
I've given too much been pushed too far
Can't figure out whose being real
Screw y'all fools
That's the way I feel

Cause that's my life

You know I never stopped believing 
You turned all my loneliness to truth 
Baby don't you break this feeling 
Whether or not my heart starts beating 
Tell me did I mean a thing to you? 

Catch the midnight train to go back home 
It's hard to tell how long my soul can roam 
Things don't feel right I can feel them in my bone 
As the train pulled up I saw you in his arms 
I never knew the reason why everytime I asked you lied 
Now I know that you ain't coming home 
You used up all your alibi's its hard to tell the reason why 
Why you have to leave this boy alone?

If I could change in the end 
I wouldn't do it again, and again, and again

And what life should be, be happy to know

Do you like the things life in showing you? 
I did you wrong, hope you understand that I'm trying to change

Trouble may come but don't leave it 
Take your time and slow it down girl 
You are the star that shines bright in my world 
Soon you'll see that time will come easy 
You are the only one that can please me 
In your eyes I see the future-rewind and come again... 

Listen to your friends, believe them if you want to 
In the end you know it doesn't really matter 
They don't have a clue if they knew how much I want to

You sit alone but now I wish that you would find your way 
Since you been in my life my days seem shorter and my nights with you so long 
Gotta feeling deep inside of me, you're tearing me apart 
Running through my veins you feel the pounding of my beating heart 
When you're gone, night or day trying to find peace of mind hideaway 
Or does she love me at all?

Rain and the thunder she's taking me under 

Got me feeling things that a lonely man can't understand 
Want her all the time but she only see's me when and if she can 
Who would ever thought that I could fall in love 
Somethings are better left unexplained 
Still I sit and wonder why, did my life just pass me by? 
Now I'm wrapped up in the games we play left me in this land alone

Who am I a foolish man to think this way 
Addicted to your love, what a price to pay 
The people see me off the ground and dust me off again

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",On/Off

And it's beginning to get to me
That I know more of the stars and sea
Than I do of what's in your head
Barely touching in our cold bed
Are you beginning to get my point
That all this fighting with aching joints
It's doing nothing but tire us out?
No one knows what this fight's about

The answered phone
The lonely sound of your voice
Frozen in time

I only need
The compass that you gave me
To guide me on

'Cause I can carry you on my back
After our enemies attack

And not collapse under its weight

I can only give you everything I've got
I can't be as sorry as you think I should
But I still love you more than anyone else could

All that I keep thinking throughout this whole flight
Is it could take my whole damn life to make this right
This splintered mast I'm holding on won't save me long
Because I know fine well that what I did was wrong

The last girl and the last reason to make this last for as long as I could
First kiss and the first time that I felt connected to anything
The weight of water, the way you told me to look past everything I had ever learned
The final word in the final sentence you ever uttered to me was love

We have got through so much worse than this before
What's so different this time that you can't ignore?
You say it is much more than just my last mistake
And we should spend some time apart for both our sakes

The last girl and the last reason to make this last for as long as I could
First kiss and the first time that I felt connected to anything
The weight of water, the way you told me to look past everything I had ever learned
The final word in the final sentence you ever uttered to me was love

I hang my coat up in the first bar
There is no peace that I've found so far
The laughter penetrates my silence
As drunken men find flaws in science

Their words mostly noises
Ghosts with just voices
Your words in my memory
Are like music to me

I'm miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground
And I pray that something picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms

After I have traveled so far
We'd set the fire to the third bar
We'd share each other like an island
Until exhausted, close our eyelids
And dreaming, pick up from
The last place we left off

But not our last days of silence, screaming, blur

Most of what I remember makes me sure
I should have stopped you from walking out the door

You made me happier than I'd been by far

Snow Patrol,"Tell me if I'm going crazy
But everything you said amazed me
It seems too easy on the ear
To be something I should adhere to

You told me to just simply wander
Rather than take shelter under
And open my heart to the thought that
Life is something you're not caught at

Too easy to get lost in progress
I didn't see you there in that dress
And suddenly the world seems so small
We'd fit it all inside out front hall

To ever see the light that you gave
Don't wanna take it nice and slow here
Don't wanna waste a minute more dear

And all the stars collapsed behind the pitch black night
And I can barely see your face in front of mine
But it is knowing you are there that makes me fine

Maybe it's the warmer climate
Maybe I'm a smarter primate
Maybe it's the beer I'm drinking
Maybe I've stopped over thinking

The sweetness in the morning after
You are the cry that turns to laughter
You're the hope that ends disaster

It seems careless that I shouldn't care less

And there was no keeping up with you.
It's no triumph I knew I was for the high jump
But I delighted in my best mistake.

I only thought of me.
I only thought of me.
Now you're all I see.
Now you're all I see.

Reading backwards I see where the attack was
Which in real time came out of the blue.
It's the weakness that I love this bleakness
Over any constant happiness.

Take me out of this.
Carry me with love.

Snow Patrol,"And for my opening line 
I'm not trying to indicate my state of mind. 
I turn you on, 
I tell you that I'm laughing just to keep from crying 
Pretty music when you hear it, 
Keep on trying to get near it.
A little rhythm for your spirit 
Oh but that's what it's for 
Come on in, here's the door

And I've seen a sparrow get high 
And waste his time in the sky 
He thinks it's easy to fly 
He's just a little bit freer than I

Now here's a mystery 
And maybe you can help to make it clear to me 
When you're fast asleep 
Then what is it that's lighting up the dreams you see 
Only your tears can't conceal it 
And only your prayers may not reveal it 
You've got soul so you can feel it 
And when you make the scene 
Well you know what I mean 

Hey, I've seen a sparrow get high 
And waste his time in the sky 
He thinks it's easy to fly 
He's just a little bit freer than I

Down here on the ground 
When you find folks are giving you the runaround 
Keep your game uptight 
And if you must just take your secrets underground 
Now politicians are trying to speech you 
Mad color watchers are trying to teach you
Very few will really try to reach you 
If you're lost in a stack 
That's OK, come all black

Now I'd be the last to deny 
That I'm just an average guy 
And don't you know each little bird in the sky 
Is just a little bit freer than I

Hey ordinary Joe 
Although they say you're just a lazy so-and-so 
What they think is real 
Is nothing but an animated puppet show
So don't let time and space confuse you 
And don't let name and form abuse you 
Let that Big Joe Williams blues you 
In the light of the sun you can see how they burn

And waste his time in the sky 
He thinks it's easy to fly

Like the wings of the last bird to leave
For the south for the heat for no reason

Makes the cold just a word, just a sound

Snow Patrol,"It's like we just can't help ourselves
Cause we don't know how to back down
We were called out to the streets
We were called out to the towns, how the heavens they opened up
Like arms of dazzling gold
With our rain-washed histories well we do not need to be told

Show me now
Show me the arms aloft
Every eye , trained on a different star
This my chick
This drunken semaphore, and I
We are listening
And we're not blind
This is your life, this your time
We are listening, and were not blind
This is your life, this is your time

I was called out in the dark
By a choir of beautiful cheats
And as the kids took back the parks
You and I were left with the streets

Show me now
Show me the arms aloft
Every eye, trained on a different star
This my chick
This drunken semaphore
And I, we are listening
And we're not blind
This Is your life
This is your time
We are listening
And we're not blind
This is your life
This is your time

And we're not blind

Snow Patrol,"You called my name in the dark, called me back to the start
The condensation is building tension
Stubborn silence is formed, around our bodies it's warm
The cool wet grasses as summer passes
Frightened under attack, fallen flat on my back
Arms and legs, I'm too scared to beg
Harm me most when it's light, thought of you don't sit right
I need the darkness a desperate embrace

Razing cities to dust, faces dripping in lust
Fallen empires and raging bush fires
All your words unfounded, secret lives bound in bed
Living backwards and tangled back words
Ruined everything right, so good can't see the light
From my cave I can see the wave, fallen empires and raging bush fires

Snow Patrol,"There's the river there's your house and there's the church
And there's us years ago
Deep in your garden where the nettle met the rose
Is where we'd hide ourselves
Yes we were just kids, but you couldn't tell us that
These are the garden rules, that's what you always said

Oh, you'll never know, how much I love you so
Oh, you will never know, how much I love you

You would call the garden rules out like commands
And we would all obey
But you'd stifle giddy laughter as you spoke
And puncture the pretend
Then we would chase our tails, until the sun forgot to shine
And our parents called our names, 'til just you and I were left

Oh, you'll never know, how much I love you so
Oh, you will never know, how much I love you

From your house we walk the river
To the church by the silent fields
Amongst the lavender and headstones
And the larks in our Sunday clothes
Your father calls to you as he's looking at his watch
You leave me with a kiss on my quickly heating cheek

Oh, you'll never know, how much I love you so
Oh, you will never know, how much I love you

Was the day that you'd always planned to leave anyway

Makes the world look like pennies in my hand

I'll never let go, I'll never let go you shouted out

Your words shook me right out of a daydream
I was lost somewhere cold and it looked haunted
I was asking strangers but no one understood me
I was drenched in sweat when your words came to me

I'll never let go, I'll never let go you said out loud
I'll never let go, I'll never let go you shouted out

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

It was the last highway you would ever travel
The long road from a daughter, wife and son
When the bus stopped a beat from California
Your tired feet they ached over the road

For the lies I've told
That the truth it no longer thrills me

And why can't we laugh?
When it's all we have
Have we put these childish things away?
Have we lost the magic that we once had?

In the end, in the end
There's nothing more to life than love, is there?
In the end, in the end
It's time for us to lose our weary minds

Will you dance with me?
Like we used to dance
And remember how to move together

You are the torch
And it all makes sense
I've waited here for you forever
I've waited here for you forever

The fan club on the jukebox, the birds and yes the bees

This is all I ever wanted from life, this is all I ever wanted from life
This is all I ever wanted from life

Words of reassurance but only if they're true
Just some simple kindness, no vengeance from the gods

This is all I ever wanted from life, this is all I ever wanted from life
This is all I ever wanted from life

And be for them what I've had, a father like my dad

If the curve of you was curved on me

'Cause I loved the simple thought of you

If our hearts are never broken and there's no joy in the mending
There's so much this hurt can teach us both,
And there's distance and there's silence, your words have never left me,

And the lack of it snaps me in two

In the arms you said you'd never leave
I'd tell you that it's simple and it was only ever thus

And you know they'll never leave,

Like the wolf calls to her young

And the dark never enters
But it also never leaves,
And this spark that he gave you
Is just an ember all but out

If he'd one eye on the exit,
Oh you never would have known
Until he drove off in the darkness
Like some slowly fading song

The lightning picks on emptiness.
The horse without a rider takes the race.
The thunder races on through dawn.
The horse without a rider charges on.",All You Need

Snuff,"Looking for an answer, tough shit there's none to give.
All gone astray, lost on the way.
Looking for choices the sale's on every day, bargains galore all stowed away.
The same brick wall no matter where you stand.
No answers no choices just silence and darkness.

No truth no lies no nothing surprise surprise.
Nothing to say no matter how you try you're heading for a fall.
No matter how you try no matter what you say.

A voice to echo 'round my brain there to remind me how to
Lose it all, open up a void, lose it all.
Always there breathing down my neck.
Always one step behind me.

Always there to remind me.
I'll feel your arms around me.
I'll taste your blood inside me.

I'll dream your lips on mine once again, because i love you darling.

What price to answer, what price to pay.
A viscous rumour is round again.
So if you're trying to keep it even then the effort's wasted.
Trying to keep it even but the ground's against it.
That burden will drag you on with the flow.
Who's answer, who's to guess.
A filthy bastard, a fucking mess.
What rhyme and jingle tagged on behind.
A viscous rumour starts to unwind.
Trying to keep it even but the hands get tired (round again).

Watch the thief follow the aftermath, wasting time just hanging round.
Waste an hour, watch the shadows rolling, watch the thief go walking by.

I'm sure there's always going to be thieves and liars, robbers and cheats.
I'm sure there's always going to be eyes in the darkness.

Snuff,"They called his name when he was 18.
He couldn't wait to go.
He knew that there was glory waiting, he knew all there was to know.
So when they called his name he joined the line.
Turned into a number, got tickets for the show.
Eyes front join the line he signed his name, faded into khaki.
Got seats in the front row.

He knew it would be high adventure, a big pub brawl in the sun.
He'd come home to a heroes welcome, he knew the time would come.
But then three days forced march later through the debris of hell,
all his preconceptions blown away into nightmare.

Wasted numbers.

So when they called his name he joined the line to do his bit for king & country,
took the shilling, sang the songs, took the tin hat and showered spirit.

The one that walked away can't find the words to say.
In the early morning sun death just did a little dance.
He opened up a grave and stole the day.
He stopped believing.

She was my beatnik girl
We talked about statues and
Then we went back to her house
And then we sat down
On the ground
And she played some modern jazz

'cause she was reading Naked lunch
She's into Kandinsky
Has all of Klaus Kinsky's films
Like it or not
It's a shock that
She likes to rock
And I can't deny

And I feel so good
