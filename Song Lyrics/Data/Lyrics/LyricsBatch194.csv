Jill Scott,"Ah
There's something on my back
That I need to get off baby
The world's been nuts
Just the other day
I had to reprimand a grown up
Who am I to act this way
But sugar I'm the boss lady
Busy handling and managing
But oh
When I get next to you baby (hey)
Ain't nobody gonna be there
But me and you, you, you, you

(Can't wait to be loved by you)
I can't wait baby
(Can't wait to be loved by you)
I've been working so hard and so long
(Can't wait to be loved by you)
I need to come home I do I do
(Can't wait to be loved by you)
I do

I've been going through somethings
Feeling all kinds of hectic in my space
We all running the same race
Just to pay some bills
Staring monsters in their face (with grace)
You'd be so proud
Money made, bills to be paid
Like each and everybody
But baby I need
And I need you
Ooh
When I get next to you baby
Ain't nobody gonna be there but me and
You, you, you

(Can't wait to be loved by you)
I can't wait baby (baby)
(Can't wait to be loved by you)
I've been working so hard and so long
(Can't wait to be loved by you)
I need your arms I do I do
(Can't wait to be loved by you)
Come to me soon (hee)

What you want to get off
You can get it off right here
Baby no fear
Let all that old thing go
Don't worry 'bout it no more
Got you baby no
I got you right here
Deep in the bedroom
I got you baby
Or maybe in the back of a car
What up
What up baby
What's up

What you wanna get off
You can get it off right here
Baby no fear
Let all that old thing go
Don't worry 'bout it no more (worry no more)
Got you baby
I got you right here

Got you right here

Mm hm
Wooh
Mm hm
When I get next to you baby
Ain't no body gonna be here but me and
You

Can't wait to be loved by you
I can't wait baby
Can't wait to be loved by you
I'm busy holding the world on my shoulders
Can't wait to be loved by you
And baby I know you're out there
Can't wait to be loved by you
Doing what you need to do too

Dooh dooh ooh",Canât Wait
Jill Scott,"In the morning when I wake up
I'mma take a little time and bring up
The fact that we did break up
And just for one night we made up
And we made love, and it was so good
That sweet, rough, that funky stuff
I can tell by your moans, you ain't get enough
Baby you want, but it ain't my love

Don't be expecting no breakfast in the morning baby
You got all you gon' get, this is it, this is closure
This is closure, this is closure, this is closure, told ya

Now you're looking at me with faces
'Cause I went two different places
You're thinking it's a new beginning
When I know that it's the ending
We ended our time for a reason
Our trouble was never pleasing
Each other we got the right seeds done
That ain't enough to plant our dreams in
Oh I want some sugar in my bowl
A deeper connection baby
Don't you want more?
I think it's time that we move forward
I've hurted like a kid turned on you wrong
This is the last time I hope you enjoyed
Now would you mind leaving out the back door?

Don't be expecting no breakfast baby
You got all you gon' get
This is it, this is closure
This is closure, this is closure, this is closure, told ya

Look homie
There will be no more homemade waffles, okay?
With the fresh strawberries, you know the ones I put the agave in
There will be no more quiche and no more sausages
And don't even think about my pepper jack grits
Or my grandma's buttermilk biscuits (told ya)

Hungry?
You want something to eat?
You want some of my time? You want some of affection?
You want my honesty? You want me to listen to you baby?
Aw, is that what you want from me?
You better get that backdoor
Told you (told ya)
You don't know",Closure
Jill Scott,"I'm on my way to show ya
I'm not gon' wait beside the road no no
I know the world's been gettin' to ya babe
It's such a such a heavy load
You need to hold on

Ooh, they're gonna tell you turn your head now
From love and hate instead
Don't let your heart be confused no more
Don't be mislead
I'm almost there
Baby

And when I get to ooh
And when I get to you babe
Gonna leave all that old stuff on the floor
We're gonna take love higher baby
To heights they've never seen before
And they gon' say
Wooo
'Cause they can feel it too
In every part of the room
In a deep full bloom
And soon
I'm comin' to you baby
I'm on my way
I'm almost there
I'm comin' to you

I know you're tired of waiting
Baby baby what you been through
I think I know what make you feel good
How 'bout a slice of fan
So good that you can taste it
Baby please don't you waste it
You just don't know how much I missed ya
No need to wait now
I'm on my way
Now

And when I get to
When I get to you babe
Gonna leave all that old stuff on the floor
We're gonna take love higher
To heights they've never seen before
And they gon' say
Wooo
They can feel it too
Love in the room
In a deep full bloom
And soon
I'm comin' to you
I'm comin' to you baby
I'm almost there
I'm comin' for you
I play the winning team, baby
I'm almost there
Ain't no stopping me
For getting to you honey
I've got so much love to give

(Break it down)

Some people
They don't understand
How music can pull up
And help rebuild a man
It put color where it ain't
Put color where others can't
Ooh
I'm almost there

But when I get to you
But when I get to you
Gonna leave all that old stuff on the floor
We're gonna take love higher baby
To heights they've never seen before
And they gon' say
Wooo
'Cause they can feel it too
In every part of the room
In a deep full bloom

I'm comin' to you baby
Baby baby
I'm almost there
I'm comin' to you",Coming to You
Jill Scott,"You say you wanna love me
'Cause that's what I need
But I ain't sure
If that's what you're here for
You say I can trust you
And I wanna believe
I hear your words but my heart needs to see

I can't see myself
Waking in the morning with someone else
But I can't tell if it's real I need to know

So I'm cruisin' in the evening breeze
To clear my mind
Take my time so I can breathe
Cruisin' in the evening breeze
To clear my mind
Take my time so I can breathe

In my past I made mistakes because
I was drunk on love too quick to trust
Jumped in too easy
Yet we feel like we could be an us
But my fear is strong though I've seen no wrong
I hope I'm not dreaming

I can't see myself
Waking in the morning with someone else
But I can't tell if it's real I need to know

So I'm cruisin' in the evening breeze
To clear my mind
Take my time so I can breathe
Cruisin' in the evening breeze
To clear my mind
Take my time so I can breathe

You seem like you're on time
You feel like a good guy
You make my mind wander
We're laughing all the while
You're holding out your hand
You're such a lion man
But I'm scared

So I'm cruisin' in the evening breeze
To clear my mind
Take my time so I can breathe
Cruisin' in the evening breeze
To clear my mind
Take my time so I can breathe",Cruisin
Jill Scott,"Oh, silly me my dear, for thinking that you'd stay
Gave you my heart and then you ran away
Either I'm stupid, I'm foolish, or you're playing me
But it seems, we were never really meant to be

So I thought I would try something new
I wanted to find out if I could live happy without you
And it turned out I wasn't living at all
I'd rather never known if you had just played along

I was living the dream believing things that just ain't true
Oh I can't believe I ever believed in you
You had me chasing fool's gold
I was chasing fool's gold
I was chasing fool's gold

So I did die inside knowing you weren't right
But breaking your spell was a plan I never devised
I wanna be here forever if it's for you
But I would had been living forever as your fool

I was living the dream believing things that just ain't true
Oh I can't believe I ever believed in you
You had me chasing fool's gold
I was chasing fool's gold
I was chasing fool's gold

I bit in to the apple
I took the wooden neck out
I was blinded to my core
And I went into the wrong door
And furthermore

I was living the dream believing things that just ain't true
Oh I can't believe I ever believed in you
You had me chasing fool's gold
I was chasing fool's gold
I was chasing fool's gold

I was living the dream believing things that just ain't true
Oh I can't believe I ever believed in you
You had me chasing fool's gold
I was chasing fool's gold
I was chasing fool's gold

I was living the dream believing things that just ain't true
Oh I can't believe I ever believed in you
You had me chasing fool's gold
I was chasing fool's gold
I was chasing fool's gold",Fool's Gold
Jill Scott,"I would climb inside
A red balloon floating towards the noon
For you
I would fly across the midnight sky
The stars and the moon
For you too
And on that flight I devise a
A new way to say
How much I love you
Tippy tah, sight ah tay
I'm still working on it, baby please forgive me
I think I try

How bout jahraymecofasola
How bout jahraymecofasola
How bout jahraymecofasola

Well

On my way I realized
I didn’t have a gift for you
So I racked my mind on what it is now
That I am supposed to do
Then it hit me I kissed the love in the air
Hugged rain before it falls down
Put infinity into a melody
And see how it sounds

Sounds like
Jahraymecofasola
Sounds like jahraymecofasola
Sounds like jahraymecofasola

Oh almost there now, oh
Just a million miles to go oh
And still I can contain
How you make me glow, oh you make me glow
People look up at me and ouh
They think that I’m a star
But it’s all because the love you give to me
It made me who I are

And it sounds like, it sounds like
Jahraymecofasola
Hmm, it sounds like jahraymecofasola
It sounds like jahraymecofasola

Hmm",Jahraymecofasola
Jill Scott,"I know, oh

Says you're going through some things
And for sure
Maybe for sure
I'm here
Mmm hmm here for you baby
Yes
Whatever it is
Trouble is deep
I can see by your eyes
They're heavy to me
Talk to me baby

I am your shelter

Look here hol' up
You got a lot goin' on
I can see
By the way you walk
And how you got your shoulders on
Baby everybody get wet
When the rain is falling
Can't stop now 'cause the wind is foreign
It's a fact
Of the universe
That sometimes
Life is pain
And it can hurt
But I know
That it'll get better
Because you've gone through worse
Hey

Sitting here
Contemplating
If we should even be
See I'm in love with a man
Who loves me
For me
He'd do anything
Easily
Oh his heart knows no boundaries
But
He needs
Sometimes
To write
With a different pen
On different paper
He needs
Oh
He needs
He needs
Mmm hmmm

So I'm sitting here
Contemplating
If we should even be
Like him
I, too, have needs
Like
Like I'm so happy
Hypnotic and sweet
Like
Part of the dream
And, and I need you
On the other side of the speaker
To look up a little more
And think a little deeper
And live in your truth
I need that too
I need to do that too

I used to be stuck
How 'bout you
Inside a lie
That you know ain't near
Near the absolute truth

And you keep
You keep ignoring the signs
Listening to it happening to you again songs
And put your alarm on
Sleep
Inviting new dumb s***
And more loss of peacefulness

Ask for direction
Ask for protection

Awakening
An ego-reshapening
Pencil-sharpening, heart-mending a pride shifting
And a cure to the Wild Cookie
Now, Wild Cookie choices lead to lonely pregnancy
And anybody that knows
Knows that ain’t all it could be
Scuffling to make sense out of his missing presence
In the current tense
When the romance is gone
Just paper and pen
Infant and journal tear
Private and public embarrassment
The demise of a dreamer’s dream
A girl not so unlike me
Sick with some shit that just shouldn’t be
'Cause her desire to be desired and his way would pee pee
Oh, Wild Cookie
Stop Now, count your blessings
All these kids and the systems don’t know where they are
'Cause their momma and daddy done lef’em
It’s a pandemic
Just the other day
My girlfriend said she was watching TV
And her Wild Cookie detached from it’s seat
And was strolling down a hundred twenty fifth yelling
“somebody, anybody come get me!”
She caught her Wild Cookie in between two parked cars
With a foolish man enticing it with a candy bar
Nameless prick
Attached to some guy who just wanted to escape his troubles for a bit
She cried aww Cookie, you got to work with me
You can’t rule my world
You don’t have no brain you ain’t meant to lead you mean
I mean you can get a couple of things
But things are things
And i deserve to feel my heart ring

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break!

Jill Sobule,"You've opened up my careful eyes
Woke up from a black and white slumber
I notice things I didn't before
I dream with you in living color
In living color

Fingertips touch a granite heart
I open up like a flower
Light as the wind that carries me there
Into the land of living color
Of living color

Time can now pass through the haze
Memories form more bright
Loving you dulled senses come alive
In living color

In living color now
A wet moon shines a prismed light
Reflecting a vision of wonder
I notice things I didn't before
I see myself in living color

Jill Sobule,"It's been five years since the man has died
Don't think the people have changed
We can put up posters, we can riot in the streets
Still a woman can't make ends meet

[Chorus]
So why don't you do something about it?
Things don't happen to you, you make them happen
She laughed
You don't understand, you're from another land
Things here are different

Here in sunny Spain the widows all wear black
To show their respect and their sorrow
Here in Spain, so simple is our life
You're either a whore, a mother, or a wife

[Chorus]

We've seen your freedom
We get your TV shows
So sinful, so inviting

You thought I didn't see
By the way that you stared
I know there's something there

What you don't want me to know
There's a warmth inside your hide (I can feel)
That would start a flame
Your little secret stays with me (don't you know)
I'll never give it away

Oh you're too cool to fall in love
You're too cool to fall in love
Only fools have open hearts
You're too cool

So distant, so free
Pretending mystery
Calculating every move
Tell me what you got to prove
It doesn't matter what we do (no one cares)
So why you are still playing safe
And don't you know I would give my heart and soul
I'm not the one who's afraid

On his cigarette
Billows of smoke
Pouring out of him
Like a firefighter
Hit by a torpedo

Before the fire
Reached the hold
She was hanging on to him
Like he was a raft
We both agreed, we'd never be
The couple on the street

We were so rosy-cheeked
And fresh and horny
On our way to the movies
When you told me for the first time
That you loved me,
And I knew that you loved me
And it was like we were together
In another life
We never parted and love never died
Although I don't really
Buy that stuff, today I'll believe
You and me, well never be
The couple on the street

Like a still life
Of our worst fears
Like the seven years
Of a broken mirror
I love you so much
Won't you tell me please
We'll never be

Jill Sobule,"If I had a lot of money
I'd move to another country
I'd disappear, not tell a soul, I'd change my name
Or maybe I'd go back to school
Major in something foolish
And I could do it cause I'd have a lot of money
Here I am holding on to childhood's dream
Sitting in my apple tree
Swaying as the branches tremble under me

The jig is up, it's all been played
The well is dry, the bed's been made
The jig is up, the jig is up

Maybe I could jump,
Jump off the Brooklyn Bridge
But I don't live in Brooklyn
And I don't know how to swim
Or I could find religion
Go on some kind of mission
Feed the poor, and then I would go to heaven
If I believed in heaven

Here I am, holding on to childhood's dream
Standing on the balcony
Waiting for someone to come and rescue me

The jig is up, the dance is done
The record skips, the song's been sung
The troops have dwindled down to one
The jig is up
The jig is up, the sun has set
The train is wrecked, the sheets are wet
And like I said, the jig is up

Well I can't really disappear
Cause I don't have a lot of money
And I don't really think I want to
Go back to school
But maybe I'm just in a bad mood
And I need to change my attitude
And when I wake up tomorrow
I'll believe in heaven

Here I am, holding on to childhood's dream
Climbing down the apple tree
Waking as you pull the covers off of me
The jig is up

The jig is up, yes it's been tough
The punch is drunk, the shrink is shrunk
It's time to get the baby up
It's off to work let's start the car
We'll turn it over in its grave
And start again its soul to save
The jig is up but so what
We'll fill again this empty cup
The jig is up, the point's been made
Elvis has just left the stage
The story needs another twist 
And I have had enough of this",The Jig Is Up
Jill Sobule,"Karen, she's my boss at the shoe store
We sell to the rich on Madison Avenue
I come in late from Brooklyn on the F train
Karen says ""honey, make this your last time""
But we like her, she's firm but approachable
Dresses in style, pretty conservative
We ask her, ""hey, come out with us after work""
Karen she always declines

And we talk about
Karen by night
We imagine she must lead a very dull life
With just a cat and a book by her side
We know her by day but we don't know
Karen by night

In the stockroom searching for a 9B
I overheard Karen whisper on the phone
She said, ""Meet me at the club
There's a shipment coming in
And I can't pull this one off alone""
Well, I didn't know what to think
Was my mind playing tricks?
Was there more to this Karen then realized?
I had to know so I followed her home
I could not believe my eyes

And then I saw
Karen by night
The leather comes out under the moonlight
Takes off her Chanel and hops on her bike
Looking like young Marlon Brando
Karen by night

Saw her leaning on the bar with a drink in hand
And a cigarette dangling from her bright red lips
She looked like she was looking for someone
Like she was looking for a fight
Then a young blonde buck walked in
She grabbed him by the collar
Kissed him hard on the mouth
And slapped him on the cheek
Then I thought she spied me in the corner of her eye
So I ran outside, but all night all I could think about was

Karen by night

The next morning, I'm late as usual
Karen's there fresh as a daisy
She says with a smile, ""You look like hell
And where were you last night?""

Imagine she must lead a very dull life
With just a cat or a book by her side

I knew someday I would have to forgive her

Somewhere in France fighting traitors and fascists
You were my mistress, yes, you were a woman
But I knew it was you by the shape of your mouth
And you called me Maurice and I had a thin mustache
And I played clarinet in a decadent band
Until we

Hid in the bushes
We shot from the bushes
Made love in the bushes
Like there was no tomorrow

In my real life, I'm a cocktail waitress
Dodging men's hands
Instead of bullets
And you're a bass player
In a band 
That got a deal.
Dealing with assholes
Instead of explosives
Still we were grateful
To be alive
Together fighting 
Side by side
As we

Hide in the bushes
Shoot from the bushes
Love in the bushes
Like there is no tomorrow

We promised if one of us left or died
We'd meet again in another life

I wish I was on that train with you

I'm running from my husband, you're running from the law
But there's agents at the border so I hide you in my cabin
Of course I let you spend the night not knowing who you are
And when I let you out, you become another person

And watched the old church
Burn for the second time

They could shut the whole war out
With the squeak of the springs
And tomorrows dreams 
And the beating of their hearts

She would forgive his brother's crime
They would do anything 
To make it past Vrbana Bridge

Well he looked up to Jesus
And she looked to the east
Where the sun was soon to rise
She asked for Allah's blessings
To keep them both alive
They had friends in high places
Who could do them a favor
Turn a blind eye
They'd seen so much hate
And death every day
""Let's just let those two walk by""

They would lay their arms down for her
They would forgive his brother's crime
Just for one moment they would 
Let them pass Vrbana Bridge

Through a crack in the wall
Of a sandbagged building
The soldier saw them fall
He said ""If love was their only armor""
It did no good at all
They lay for six days
In a final embrace
They had shut the whole war out
The soldier blames the other side
But even he has his doubts

He would forgive his brother's crime

An albatross tied 'round his throat
And he tells me to forget that boat
He rambles on I just get bored
I hear the laughter of the crew
They know the ropes they'll see me through
To truth and brighter days
When my ship comes in I won't be lonely
I'll have lots of friends and they'll all want me
When my ship comes in you might be sorry
And I'll be something when my ship comes in
When my ship comes in
I'll be standing at the rail
Waving you goodbye
You'll never be standing on the beach
You'll be wondering why

When my ship comes in I might take you
You could swab the decks if you're nice today
When my ship comes in we'll be something
Won't that be something when my ship comes in

Does it occur to you I might need help?

You'd walk in and ask me ""How was your day?""

I'm sure that you really care for me
And your heart's as big as Germany
But you're as blind as they were back in '33

The Nebutol is racing through my veins
You'd come in and ask ""Are you okay?""

I'd make you eat grits and the red-eyed gravy
I'd make you sit down with the southern ladies and
their blue pantsuits
I'd talk about Jesus

I'd say you were in trucking
And I was a teacher
In a Christian school where the kids are good
And they don't do drugs and they save themselves

I wouldn't tell them you had a wife
That wasn't me and we just had sex

Who finally said why he moved on

I knew he wasn't wrong
I saw two lovers in the park
With that dreamy look of lust in their eyes
The whole world smiled as they passed by

And wait for a strange light to come and take me home
Or I will stand by the statue and wait for her to cry

With plastic beads on straps to match

Was red ball jets
So I could get over the schoolyard fence

Outside you hear them say

On the shelves I looked in horror
On display were combat boots and platforms

Jim & Jesse,"Now let me tell a story, I can tell it all
About the mountain boy who ran illegal alcohol
His daddy made the whiskey, the son, he drove the load
And when his engine roared, they called the highway thunder road

Sometimes into Ashville, sometimes Memphis Town
The revenuers, they chased him, but they couldn't run him down
Each time they thought they had him, his engine would explode
He'd go by like they were standing still on thunder road

There was thunder, thunder over thunder road
Thunder was his engine and white lightning was his load
There was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him, but the devil got him first

On the first of April, 1954
The federal man sent word, he better make his run no more
He said 200 agents were covering the state
Whichever road he'd try to take, they'd get him sure as fate

“Son”, his daddy told him, “Now make this run your last
Your tank is filled with 100 proof, you're all tuned up and gassed
Now don't take any chances, if you can't get through
I'd rather have you back again than all that mountain dew”

There was thunder, thunder over thunder road
Thunder was his engine and white lightning was his load
There was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him, but the devil got him first

Roaring out of Harlan, revving up his mill
He shot the gap at Cumberland and screamed through Maynardville
With G-men on his tail light, roadblocks up ahead
The mountain boy took roads that even angels feared to tread

Blazing right through Knoxville, out on Kingston Pike
Then right outside of Bearden, there they made the fatal strike
He left the road at ninety, that's all there is to say
The devil got the moonshine and the mountain boy that day

There was thunder, thunder over thunder road
Thunder was his engine and white lightning was his load
There was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him, but the devil got him first

Jim & Jesse,"I stopped at a roadhouse in Texas
A little place called Hamburger Dance
I heard that old jukebox playing
A song about a truck driving man

Pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
I put a nickel in the jukebox
And play that truck driving man

The waitress just brought me some coffee
I thanked her but called her again
I said that old song sure does hit me
'Cause I'm a truck driving man

Pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
I put a nickel in the jukebox
And play that truck driving man

I climbed back aboard my old semi
And then like a flash I was gone
I got that old truck wheels rollin'

Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away

Jim Aikin,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence
Jim Altamore,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

The more I see you as years go by

One more down in accordance with my fate
One long drift across the lake of Avalon
One more trip that I must create

And my eyes sweep a shore
That was always there
A blood red line
Through the sonisphere
I can't resolve where it's coming from
I sense it's the great pandemonium

One more, just one more
Just one, just one more day
One more day by the pits of hell
Just one more when even yesterday was too late
One more thought that I have to sow
One last trick that you can't debate

War

On a silent shore
I confronted fear
I spoke to god
But he wasn't there
The sun is down
And the war begun
Assemble the great pandemonium

Growls
Break down
Got to break down
Break down

And my eyes sweep a shore
That was always there
A blood red line
Through the sonisphere
I can't resolve where it's coming from
I sense it's the great pandemonium

On a silent shore
I confronted fear
I spoke to god

The sun is down

You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

Carry it home and cook it for supper

Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang

To get the things that we've wanted and get the things 
We've left behind, what you wanted what you needed 
What you've always dreamt about. 

don't take another step, don't breath another breathe
Unless your coming back to me

I'm trusting you and I'm taking the long way home
I'm leaving, and its not because of you, 
Will you just hold me tight and never let me go 
I know this whole things wrong but baby were invincible

if I could take these words and fill them up with air
I'd fly you too the stars so we can disapear
If I could take your heart and keep it close to me 
I swear it will not brake, I swear it will not bleed,
And I believe just anything you say 

if you'd tell me to get lost id ask how far away 
And now its getting late and I can't keep my eyes open
But my hearts open for you

I can see your world, beautiful and new
And although I'm not sure where it's leading to
We will travel on, our fate unknown
And for once I know I'm not alone

Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its babel sounds the blessed angels sing

Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
Oh, rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing

When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When the new heaven and earth shall own the prince of peace their king

My angel in the night
You are my love
The love of my life

Now here you are
With midnight closing in
You take my hand as our shadows dance
With moonlight on your skin

I look in your eyes
I'm lost inside your kiss
I think if I'd never met you
About all the things i'd missed

Sometimes it's so hard to believe
When a love can be so strong
And faith gave me the strength
And kept me holding on

You are the love of my life
And I'm so glad you found me
You are the love of my life
Baby put your arms around me
I guess this is how it feels
When you finally find something real
My angel in the night
You are my love

What we believe in
Funny, just the other day
I was walking down the street
Stopped into that place
You know, the one where we used to meet
Thought I heard you call my name
And I whispered on the wind
And I remember you were going,
Never coming back again
But if love is what we believe in
I'll see you in heaven's first bright star
If seeing is believing
I look into the skies and there you are
You're not that far
'Cause love is what we believe in
Looking through some photographs
From not so long ago
Right now, I'd give anything
If I had only known
I would never you touch you, hold you
Or kiss your face
Feel your arms around me
Or fall in your embrace
Now love will break your heart
When you say goodbye
But love is worth the pain
And all tears you cry
And if seeing is believing
I look into the skies and there you are
You're not that far
'Cause love is what we believe in
And you are in my heart
And our love is what I believe in.",What We Believe In [*]

Is this all that we get, what a way to go
Five minutes in heaven
Breathe that scream into me, what a sad little show

It feels like love
Not some rigged up holiday
Where I believe in somebody who can bring me down again
It feels like love
Is this how you make me pay
Branding me with deep cuts that will never go away

Did you stage this yourself, every twist and turn
Five minutes in heaven
What a masterpiece, will we ever learn

Jim Brickman,"Mom and Dad were reading in the den
Mom said, ""I'm gonna go to bed, it's late""
She went to the kitchen to make three school lunches
Another night in a mother's day
Put the cereal bowls out for breakfast
Set the coffeemaker for 6 a.m.
Sewed a loose button on brother's shirt for him

Checked sister's math homework, sent a note to the teacher
Added eggs to the grocery list
Started a load of wash, made sure the doors were locked
Put water in the puppy's dish
Wrote a check to the children's piano teacher
Turned the dishwasher on
And Dad called out, ""Honey, what's takin' you so long?""

Have I ever thanked you
For everything you've done?
Now all that I can say is
""I love you, Mom""

Hung some art on the refrigerator door
And headed up the stairs
Kissed all the children and helped sister comb
Her wavy golden hair
Washed her make-up off and turned on the bath
Lay down in the moon's soft light and kissed Dad goodnight

Have I ever thanked you
For everything you've done?
Now all that I can say is
""I love you, Mom""

Thank you for nursin' me
Through all those colds and fevers
Thank you for believin' in me
When they were no other believers

And it's never too late to say

In your hands

Though in this burden of my making
Yet in the shadows, still a light I see
Maker whose love is not forsaken
Oh, Lord be Thou near to me

And the holy voices sing Hallelu
Ever will Thy reign be
As I wander through this life
Oh, Lord be Thou near to me

And the holy voices sing Hallelu
Ever will Thy reign be
As I wander through this life
Oh, Lord be Thou near to me
Oh, Lord be Thou near to me",Be Thou Near to Me
Jim Brickman,"Crown him with many crowns, 
The Lamb upon his throne.
Hark! How the heavenly anthem drowns 
All music but its own.
Awake, my soul, and sing of him 
Who died for thee,
And hail him as thy matchless King 
Through all eternity.

Crown him the virgin's Son, 
The God incarnate born,
Whose arm those crimson trophies won 
Which now His brow adorn;
Fruit of the mystic rose, 
As of that rose the stem;
The root whence mercy ever flows, 
The Babe of Bethlehem.

Crown him the Son of God, 
Before the worlds began,
And ye who tread where he hath trod, 
Crown him the Son of Man;
Who every grief hath known 
That wrings the human breast,
And takes and bears them for His own,
That all in him may rest.

Crown him the Lord of life, 
Who triumphed over the grave,
And rose victorious in the strife 
For those he came to save.
His glories now we sing, 
Who died, and rose on high,
Who died eternal life to bring, 
And lives that death may die.

Crown him the Lord of peace, 
Whose power a scepter sways
From pole to pole, that wars may cease, 
And all be prayer and praise.
His reign shall know no end, 
And round his piercèd feet
Fair flowers of paradise extend
Their fragrance ever sweet.

Crown him the Lord of love, 
Behold his hands and side,
Those wounds, yet visible above, 
In beauty glorified.
No angel in the sky 
Can fully bear that sight,
But downward bends his burning eye 
At mysteries so bright.

Crown him the Lord of Heaven, 
Enthroned in worlds above,
Crown him the King to whom is given 
The wondrous name of Love.
Crown him with many crowns, 
As thrones before him fall;
Crown him, ye kings, with many crowns, 
For he is King of all.

Crown him the Lord of lords, 
Who over all doth reign,
Who once on earth, the incarnate Word, 
For ransomed sinners slain,
Now lives in realms of light, 
Where saints with angels sing
Their songs before him day and night, 
Their God, Redeemer, King.

Crown him the Lord of years, 
The Potentate of time,
Creator of the rolling spheres, 
Ineffably sublime.
All hail, Redeemer, hail! 
For thou has died for me;
Thy praise and glory shall not fail 
Throughout eternity.

Jim Brickman,"Take these tears, put 'em in a bottle.
Don't let these tears I cry be in vain.
Take these tears, keep them up in heaven.
Water my life with tears like rain
Hear me, hear my words unspoken, Restore my faith in hoping
Hear me, I am feeling broken I am broken open.
Take this life, turn it into something, I'm afraid it's just wasting time
Turn this life the sun has ripened, grow it slowly on the vine. 
Turn my tears into wine
Hear me, hear my words unspoken, Restore my faith in hoping
Hear me, I am feeling broken I am broken open.
Turn my tears into wine, turn these tears into wine.

Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made

How great Thou art, how great Thou art
Then sings my soul, my Savior, God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art

When Christ shall come with shouts of adulation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow in humble adoration
And there proclaim my God, how great Thou art

I saw a polka-dot railroad tie

Made a vegetable truck

I saw a baseball bat

Someone shoots a gun
In the midnight air.

Somebody lives, somebody dies;
Somebody wrongs and a mother cries.
And I don't know why.

Other things you change if you can.

And the heart is right where love lives,
And love can always find a way.

It's not too late to find us.
One day we may be in peace.

Haven't spoken in thirty years
After angry words and bitter tears.
And I don't know why.
Best of brothers and best of friends;
One mistake and their story ends.
And I don't know why.

Some things we'll never understand;
Other things you change if you can.

While sugar plum fairies dance in your hair
Tomorrow you'll wake and open your eyes

Sail through the dream--that's where wishes come true
I'll meet you on dawned morning light

And when you get scared, you won't be alone

All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more

Alone in the gloom once more I'm close to you

Melancholy serenade as the music starts to fade

Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone

So I lit a fire

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

But she don't see his pupils as they're shrinking

He thinks he's controlling his habit
But soon from this earth
He will leave

He used to be a very happy fellow
And everything he did was very mellow
But now his skin is slowly turning yellow
Looking just like a bad dream

He used to play a melody so pretty
On a silver stick a long way from the city
But now my heart is so filled up with pity
What can we do with him now

He's just a boy with a problem he can't conceal
He thinks he's controlling his habit
But soon from this earth
He will leave

I'm gonna write a song and send it to him
And maybe he will see just what I'm feelin'
I've still got love and hope and my affection
To keep him from fading away

The earth is pure, its veins are rivers of water
And man should be as a father to a daughter

Jim Capaldi,"You know I've had my share of dealing with despair.
I'm tired of seeing my dreams vanish in the air.
Enough of users and all them two time losers.
I've seen that killing floor and I just won't take no more.

So I'm gonna move out on the highway. 
Head on down the road leaving it all behind. 
Had enough of lying. There'll be no more crying this time.
Living on the edge. Running with the wind.
Soaring to the heights on an eagle's wing. 

If you wanna see your spirit flying free.
Then step outside your mind and cross over the line.
Don't spend your lifetime weeping.
For things that ain't worth keeping.
Life can be very short and you know everybody is bought. 

So I'm gonna move out on the highway. 
Head on down the road leaving it all behind. 
Had enough of lying. There'll be no more crying this time.
Living on the edge. Running with the wind.
Soaring to the heights on an eagle's wing. 

It's time to go down to Mexico.
Mescalitos' song will help you to be strong. 

So come on move on down the highway.
Head on down the road leaving it all behind.

Jim Capaldi,"All the guys that follow you around
are trying to catch your eye;
They just think that I'm a clown
I'm crazy to even try
But when I see you on the street
My whole world starts to change;
Then the blood beneath my feet
starts burning me up like a fire
and I feel like I'm falling
that's when I hear you calling
Hold my breath and look around..
Oh Anna Julia
Oh Anna Julia...
Pray for the day when your love sets me free..
People say there's no way,
that your love?s not for me..
But there'll come a day
When I tell you all that I feel;
and they'll stand and watch
while you walk away with me...

It's when my woman pawns her voice so
So she can make her old excuses sound new

But I just want one clue

'Cause when the city drops into the night
Before the darkness there's one moment of light
When everything seems clear
The other side, it seems so near
What seemed wrong?
I think it's gonna be just about right
Before the city drops, the city drops
Into the night

It's when the door to the River
That door is like 26 miles
It's when ambitious little girls start
They start to dream about a change in style
It's when the slick boys got their fingers
They got their fingers in the telephone dial

But I think I'll just wait a while

That body is my own reflection
But it ain't hip to sink that low
Unless you're gonna make a resurrection
They're always gonna come to your door
They're gonna say, ""It's just a routine inspection""
But what you get when you open your door
What you get is just another injection
And there's always gonna be one more
With just a little bit less until the next one
They wait in shadows and steal the light from your eyes
To them vision's just some costly infection
But listen, you should come with me
I'm the fire, I'm the fire's reflection
I'm just a constant warning to take the other direction

and snap a bone that is so close to the brain
And be attended to by so many down below
I saw a doctor tie you up from so far above
And you start singing just like light through a black floor
You start sliding like burned skin to a side door

Refrain:
But crow, when you throw yourself under
Singin's hard when you can't loose control
They don't know, to them in the dark you don't whisper nothin'
And they're all gonna try and rip the wind from your soul

It must have been hard to be a cashier in a bookstore
And to be surrounded by the history of your true loves
And you'd get naked between the deep shelves in the backroom
And have your brain get tan by sharp fluorescent light tubes
And you start spinning like the pillars in the temple
You'd start screaming just like Sister Aimee Semple

But Crow, when you throw yourself under
The streets are hard when you cannot lose control
They don't know, to them the dark don't whisper nothin'

It was so sweet when you brought donuts to the junkies
Hey, you'd give us something we'd go slip into our coffee
And we'd start reading lines from poems that didn't matter
You covered me with blankets in the Chelsea Hotel lobby
And I'd start reachin' for the scar along your belly
They'd start takin' us 'cause winning is their hobby

But nothing's true, she said everything is permitted

She got jewels on her tongue to time the stars
She drives all morning in unmarked cars
But nothing's true, it is all permitted

She got these special tools just to keep things tight
They robbed her eyes long ago of light
But nothing's true, she told me it's all permitted

She got inscrutable poise and nihilist charms
She gets her sleep through tubes in her arm
She said nothing is true, she said everything is permitted

She nods on graves, the marble's cold and white,
Her dreams surround the sun like a satellite
She said nothin' is true, she told me it's all permitted

The spiders [milk?] her thigh, it does not phase her
She cleans her skin with a krypton laser
Nothing is true, everything is permitted

She got heels so high, she got a gown so thin
Her eyes stop the whip before it tames her sin
She says nothin' is true, everything is permitted

You all better remember you're all alone
Because nothing is true, she said everything is permitted

The more she denies them the more they demand her

She got high heel shoes
She sings the blues
She says abracadabra when she goes down on you

She got a sister and her name is Anita
Anita got one peculiar feature
Every time that they come to meet her
She turns out like a jungle cheetah
She got spiked shoes
She hums the blues
She says razor when she goes down on you

There's another one that makes a trio
Her name is Sally but they call her Cleo
She's a Leo
She got a flat in Soho
She breaks the ceiling
Every time she twirls her mojo
She ain't got no shoes
Never had the blues

Then all their dates would call me Mister

Jim Carroll,"By jim carroll and steve linsley

You're passing,
I hear your shadow through the door
It's outlined on my shade
Like a map of some foreign shore
If I could keep that shadow,
I could live forever in these

Rooms, the rooms inside my dreams . . .
And dreams have kept me in these rooms

I've never seen her face
But I've memorized each sound . . .
The way the wind m eets grace
When it's shadows pull her gown

But I could never hear the whispers,
Voices cannot reach my room

I live inside my dreams, and dreams
Have locked me in these rooms

I have no sense of time,
Or even night and day. I left my body
Somewhere, somehow it
Just got in the way

I guess I always knew
These rooms would all lead back to you

Jim Carroll,"By jim carroll and lenny kaye

I don't believe in sin
But maybe I'll begin
A vagrant evil's climbing up my skin
The shadows from last week
Are dancing in the street
In homage to the darkness closing in

It's hard to say what's different each new morning
I need some clue to tell me when or where

But it seems I must believe
Night wears it on it's sleeve
A warning that the time's come to prepare . . .

I owe so much to someone
I've watched her teardrops fall
Like wings that melted reaching for the sun

I need her to be near
To clarify the dangers
I didn't come this far to die with strangers

I can't explain exactly what I'm saying
But you're the only reason I still care

But things become so clear
When the spider licks her tears
A warning that the time's come to prepare . . .

I beg you not to leave me
With these warnings in the air . . .
I never thought I'd say it
But for once I'm truly scared

We create every lie
In order to survive
To mirror all the terror in our souls

With nothing left to steal
Lies make our lives seem real
It slows down all the madness like a shield

I don't know why I need to understand it
I don't know if there's anyone who cares

I don't know how or why
It could be something in the sky
That makes it seem it's best to be prepared . . .

I don't know where it will be
Two by land . . . one by sea
Sleep with one eye open
Be prepared

The spectres ride the stallions of my ruin
The shifting of my blood tell me it's soon . . .

I don't know how
Or why . . . it could be
Something in the sky
That makes it seem the time says to beware

Little boy,
Looking at the sky,
Tell me what you see?

Little boy
Looking at the sky,
Tell me what you see? ? ?

As I wait in the bath
And I wait for you

Where the sky falls down in rains
And I look across the river

I watch the couples
On the corner of town
Men dressed in black tie
The ladies in gowns
A taxi pulls up
Drives them across the street,
Takes them to a place

Where they dance the night away

And I take out respect
It doctors the sickness

And it peels into the night just like a knife

But I know that she's feelin' better...
I saw her walking to the Market

She went down
The sharp black hole
She wants to die just to save her soul...

But she wants to live
She wants to start her band
She swears the stage is God's left hand

So I'm sitting in the cellar
Beneath my dark apartment
I had the angel on my shoulder
You know, his wings were kinda shattered

He plays with broken mirrors
And he said that he just saw Sally
And that Sally was with Lorraine
And they were playing in the alley

So I went around to see them
Ahhh... they were doing it together

And there was a little blood across the concrete...
I know they were feeling better...

They got straight
They understand
They wanted to die but now they got plans
They want to live; they want to start their band
They swear the stage is God's left hand

I'm waiting in the lobby
The angel dropped the mirror
But he still insists that beauty...
That beauty is just one part of terror

There's a painting on the ceiling
Of a dog . . . he had eyes like rubies,
And then the angel just remembered
That Lorraine was at the movies

I found her in the back aisle
There was blood across the next seat
When she reached out to touch me
I thought that that that was so sweet

So I stuck her with my finger
It was like a knife through leather
She had a song along her eyelid

I know she was feeling better

She got straight
She understand
She wanted to die but now she got plans

She want to live
She want to start her band
She swear the stage is God's left hand...",Lorraine
Jim Carroll,"There's a wind up in the trees
Like a voice that's whispering ""Please""
Someone's decided on dividing
Everything in two 
I'd rip the money in half
I'd even break the staff
But split apart my heart
And there's no room for you 

[Chorus]
Listen, love will always divide
You may not need both sides
It may be empty, it may be full
It's all just push and pull 
The front might be the rear
My poison pet
And you can't be sure which side you get

Come on,
Then make the decision
It's a love division 
All the jealous gestures, the blades of hurt desire
Slit my heart apart
Hear the cries that flow through the wire
They're passing through
They're split in two
I know inside, I can't divide the things I'm sure are true...
But I could take what you break
And make it all seem new 

[Chorus]

Everybody's underground commuting at the speed of sound
Listen what the wheels say
They say: ""Rip apart, rip my heart, rip my heart, 
rip the dark, trip the dark, abattoir...""

Jim Carroll,"They hit you with their papers when you're living 
on loan. They're the ones who say nothing when you
answer the phone. You see them in the alleys when
you're passing late at night, but you tell your friend
to check it and there's no one in sight
I never wanted it
I never asked for it
I surely didn't sleep with them
If the phone rings, don't answer it

Death is their only way to survive
The neck of Anubis strangled by wire

They hold their eyes in their fist
One is fire... one is ice
They roll them across the bed like some loaded dice

7 come 11 but I could not stay
I kissed her eyes on the sheets
I took a bus to yesterday

Their flesh is a cemetery, centuries old...
You are free as a lap dog
Just do what you're told

They wear spandex and gloves
And feed on fetus flesh
They're the fashion rage
Of the empirical age

But I never wanted them
Never asked for them
Didn't sleep with them
Please don't answer it

Death is their only way to get high
The neck of Anubis strangled by wire

They say, ""I'll live for your sins
If you will die for mine..."" 
I'll summon the darkness
If you buy the wine 
They're all underage
Yet they're a thousand years old 
They make you feel so clever while you're being sold",Them
Jim Carroll,"The gravity here is just sick for revenge
It's like my lungs are filled with chains . . .
The sky seems so low,
It hasn't moved this slow
Since the virgins, since the virgins went dancing for the rain
You know the stars in the night
They're like the holes in the cave
Like the ceiling of a bombed-out church
But gravity blocks my screams
It's like an enemy's dreams
My guardians quit
They quit before they started their search

[Chorus:] 
I want a world without gravity
It could be just what I need
I'd watch the stars move close
I'd watch the earth recede
I want to drift above the borders against my will
I want to sleep where the angels don't pass
But now my lips are blue
Gravity does it to you

It's like they're pressed against a mirrored glass
I want my will and capability to meet inside the region
Where this gravity don't mean a thing
It's where the angels break through . . .
It's where they bring it to you
It's where silence, silence can teach me to sing
Repeat Refrain 2 times
I want to lay beneath these sheets and never turn blue
I want to hold you, hold you tight but never touch
I want some pure, pure white; hey, we can nod all night
We can do it without thinking too much
I want the dilettantes and parvenues to choke on my wrists
They think the pearls I wear are pills
I want their gravity to shatter . . . but it really doesn't matter
I got something in my eye that kills!

Jim Carroll,"The bell rings . . .
It's a decade past my decadence
My beast wears rings and he's waiting
In the shadows of my hesitations, my silent
Hesitations . . . Each image is so clear;
It seems I have no hands
The gestures of the air confuse all my demands 
And the beast hears the bell; he comes
Out of the shadows. He rips apart the shadows . . .
And he says: 
""This is work and not play""
And he says:
""There's always more than one way . . .
This is work not play"" 
Refrain:
I see the ghosts of my childhood . . .
Dressed in blue, they trail me in the night
They drive these cars with real upholstery
They trail me until . . . here comes the night 
She was standing, standing on the balcony
Her black, black eyes folded over her eyelids
Like sheets on motel beds . . .
She must be eatin' reds
This place is filled with mirrors
It echoes what she said
And she said:
""I need a judgment day"" And she said:
""I know there's more than one way,
But I want my judgment day . . ."" 
Repeat Refrain 
To sleep without dreams
So distant from the mirror
Imitating clarity, disguising
All the terror . . . I heard a thousand bells
From a thousand old cathedrals
They rang . . . I haven't heard them since
A decade past my decadence
The beast hears the bell

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

He would dot an' carry one
Till the longest day was done
An' never seemed to know the use of fear
If we charged or broke or cut
You could bet your bloomin' nut
He'd be waitin' fifty paces right flank rear
With his mussick on his back
He would skip to our attack
An' watch us till the bugles made""Retire""
An' for all his dirty hide
He was white, clear white inside
When he went to tend the wounded under fire

It was Din, Din, Din
With the bullets kickin' dust spots on the green
And when the cartridges ran out
You could hear the front files shout
Send ammunition mules, and Gunga Din!
I shan't forget the night
When I fell behind the fight
With a bullet where my belt plate should a' been
I was chokin' mad with thirst
An' the man that spied me first
Was our good old grinnin', gruntin' Gunga Din
He lifted up my head
An' he plugged me where I bled
An' he gave me half a pint of water green
It was crawlin' and it stunk
But of all the drinks I've drunk
I'm most grateful to the one from Gunga Din

He carried me away
To where a dooli lay
An' a bullet came and drilled the beggar clean
He carried me inside
An' just before he died
I hope you like your drink said Gunga Din
So I'll meet him later on
In the place where he as gone
Where it's always double drill and no canteen
He'll be squattin' on the coals
Givin' drink to poor damn souls
I'll catch a swig in hell from Gunga Din

It was Din, Din, Din
You Lazarushian-leather Gunga Din
Tho' I've belted you an' flayed you
By the livin' God that made you
Your a better man than I am, Gunga Din",Gunga Din
Jim Croce,"Well I got my mail late last night
A letter from a girl who found the time to write
To her lonesome boy somewhere in the night
She sent me a railroad ticket, too
To take me to her loving arms
And the big steel rail
Gonna carry me home to the one I love

Well I been up tight most every night
Walking along the streets of this old town
Not a friend to tell my troubles to
My good old car she done broke down
'Cause I drove it into the ground
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love

Well look over yonder across the plain
The big drive wheels a-pounding along the ground
Gonna get on board and I'll be homeward bound
Now I ain't had a home cooked meal
And Lord I need one now
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love

Well, I been out here many a long days
I haven't found a place that I could call my own
Not a two bit bed to lay my body on
I been stood up I been shook down
I bin dragged into the sand
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love

Now here I am with my head in the sand
Walking on the broad highway will you give a ride
To a lonesome boy who missed the train last night
I went in town for one last round
And I gambled my ticket away
And the big steel rail won't carry me home to the one I love",Steel Rail Blues

From the fact that I've got me a wife and a kid

I'd save every day like a treasure and then,
Again, I would spend them with you

And you think you've seen trouble
Well you're lookin' at the man
Oh the world's own original hard luck story
And a hard time losin' man

Oh sometimes skies are cloudy
And sometimes skies are blue
And sometimes they say that you eat the bear
But sometimes the bear eats you
And sometimes I feel like I should go
Far far away and hide
'Cause I keep a waitin' for my ship to come in

Oh I saved up all my money
I gonna buy me a flashy car
So I go downtown to see the man
And he smokin' on a big cigar
Well he must' a thought I were Rockefeller
Or an uptown man of wealth
He said ""Boy I got the car that's made for you
And it's cleaner than the Board of Health""
Then I got on the highway oh I feelin' fine, I hit a bump
Then I found I bought a car held together
By wire, and a couple a' hunks of twine

Oh Friday night, feelin' right
I head out on the street
Standin' in the doorway

Is just waitin' to get a convict in his sights

Difference so seem quite as bad today.

I'll have to be low-down
Cryin' the blues
So it's goodbye, baby, the whistle is a blowin'
If I miss the train I'll have to stay around
But as long as those railroad tracks go on unending
I'll be off to another day in another town

You say you'd like to ramble with me
This ain't no life for a girl
Too many people out to get you in a hobo's world
And it gets mighty cold when you're on the road
'Cause a boxcar never was a home
But you could join me if you want
I'm gettin' mighty tired of bein' alone
So it's goodbye, baby, the whistle is a blowin'
If we miss the train we'll have to stay around
But as long as those railroad tracks go on unending
We'll be off to another day in another town

But as long as those railroad tracks go on unending
We'll be off to another day in another town
We'll be off to another day in another town","Another Day, Another Town"
Jim Croce,"[Chorus]
Big wheel, don't you roll
Big diesel, don't you whine
Through the night as I'm runnin' down the road
Big semi, don't you stop, 'cause if you do I'm not
Gonna make it back to Baltimore with my load

Well, the truckstop's warm and friendly
And the coffee keeps me up
And the waitress there would like to waste my time
But I'll have to pass it by
As it's down the road I fly
Just a racin' with that pocket watch of mine

Smoke a-puffin', tires a hummin'

Countin' road signs and the miles to Baltimore

One for radar traps

You know I might have stayed
But I couldn't hang around
To be beaten to the ground

You asked me for something
You know I couldn't lend
You tried to make me break
But it hurt too much to bend
And the more I see of what used to be our love, I find
That we've just been going nowhere
And we're never gonna get there
And we're wastin' our time

If I were just another guy
You know I might have tried
To fit into you schemes
And to have a plastic dream

It was just another lie
I couldn't swallow when I tried
Just enough to realize
I'd been pretendin' all the time

Jim Croce,"Lazy days in mid July
Country Sunday mornin's
Dusty haze on summer highways
Sweet magnolia callin'

But now and then I find myself
Thinkin' of the days
That we were walking in
The Alabama rain

Drive in movies, Friday nights
Drinkin' beer and laughin'
Somehow things were always right
I just don't know what happened

But now and then I find myself
Thinkin' of the days
When we were walking in
The Alabama rain

We were only kids
But then I've never heard it said
That kids can't fall in love
And feel the same
I can still remember the first time
I told you I love you

On a dusty mid July
Country summer's evenin's
Weepin' willows sang its lullaby
And shared our secret

But now and then I find myself
Thinkin' of the days
That we were walking in

That you were here with me

Don't you know I had a dream last night
You were here with me
Lyin' by my side so soft and warm
And you said you'd thought it over
Said that you were comin' home
But then I woke up
From my dream it was gone

I'm not the same
Can you blame me
Is it hard to understand
I can't forget
You can't change me

I was walking on a lonely road
Getting tired of dreaming alone
Like all the lonely people I have known

Seems like such a long time ago
There was no one who would share my song
I was just a boy far from home
I became a man when you came along

We spent the whole night talking
You said you'd like to see the sunrise
But in the gold of morning
T'was nothing that I had not seen in your eyes

I was so afraid to touch you
Thought you were to young to know
So I just watched you sleeping
Then you woke and said to me
The night is cold it frightens me
I could sleep so easy next to you

Wasn't very long ago
You said that you would like to share my road
Then you started singing my songs
Spent so many nights a waiting
Let's not spend the moments wasting
Time for me has very far to go
I will go if you would take me
I have never had a lover
I am young but I am so alone

We spent the whole night talking
But in the gold of morning",A Long Time Ago

Was just a matter of time
But now I've come to my decision
And it's a-one of the painful kind
'Cause now it seems that you wanted a martyr

But baby I can't hang upon no lover's cross for you

Yes, I really got to hand it to you
'Cause girl you really tried
But for ev'ry time that we spent laughin'
There were two times that I cried
And you were tryin' to make me your martyr
And that's the one thing I just couldn't do

And people are bound to change

Christmas cards you sent to me
All that I have are these
To remember you

Memories that come at night
Take me to another time
Back to a happier day
When I called you mine

But we sure had a good time
When we started way back when
Morning walks and bedroom talks
Oh how I loved you then

Summer skies and lullabies
Nights we couldn't say good-bye
And of all of the things that we knew
Not a dream survived

The way they came
Someone who knew the way
To help you play
Your daytime game
It's not the same

Well, I started out pretending
That I ought to mean enough to you
To make you want to change
Then I came to realize
That there was just too much of you
You had to rearrange

And I couldn't bear to wait around
For all your nighttime lovers to go
The way they came
And it came to hurt too much for me
To have to play your daytime games

With this heavy-duty woman I been speakin' of
Things looked kind of bad
Until the day she skated into my life

Well she might be nasty she might be fat
But I never met a person who would tell her that
She's my big blonde bomber
My heavy handed Hackensack mama

The night (you know) that I fell in love with a Roller Derby Queen
(Round 'n' round, oh round 'n' round)
The meanest hunk o' woman
That anybody ever seen
Down in the arena
Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round
Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round

Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round
Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round

Jim Croce,"Guess that it was bound to happen
Was just a matter of time
But now I've come to my decision
And it's a-one of the painful kind
'Cause now it seems that you wanted a martyr
Just a regular guy wouldn't do
But baby I can't hang upon no lover's cross for you

Yes, I really got to hand it to you
'Cause girl you really tried
But for every time that we spent laughin'
There were two times that I cried
And you were tryin' to make me your martyr
And that's the one thing I just couldn't do
'Cause baby, I can't hang upon no lover's cross for you

'Cause tables are meant for turnin'
And people are bound to change
And bridges are meant for burnin'
When the people and memories they join aren't the same

So I'll hope that you can find
Another who can take what I could not
He'll have to be a super guy
Or maybe a super god
'Cause I never was much of a martyr before
And I ain't 'bout to start nothin' new
And baby, I can't hang upon no lover's cross for you",Lovers Cross
Jim Croce,"Well the South side of Chicago
Is the baddest part of town
And if you go down there
You better just beware
Of a man named Leroy Brown

Now Leroy more than trouble
You see he stand 'bout six foot four
All the downtown ladies call him ""Treetop Lover""
All the men just call him ""Sir""

And it's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damned town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

Now Leroy he a gambler
And he like his fancy clothes
And he like to wave his diamond rings
In front of everybody's nose
He got a custom Continental
He got an Eldorado too
He got a thirty two gun in his pocket for fun
He got a razor in his shoe

And it's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damned town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

Now Friday 'bout a week ago
Leroy shootin' dice
And at the edge of the bar
Sat a girl named Doris
And oo that girl looked nice
Well he cast his eyes upon her
And the trouble soon began
And Leroy Brown learned a lesson
'Bout messin' with the wife of a jealous man

And it's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damned town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

Well the two men took to fighting
And when they pulled them off the floor
Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle
With a couple of pieces gone

And it's bad, bad Leroy Brown

Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

Jim Croce,"Snowy nights and Christmas lights
Icy window panes
Make me wish that we could be
Together again
And the windy winter avenues
Just don't seem the same
And the Christmas carols sound like blues
But the choir is not to blame

But it doesn't have to be that way
What we had should have never have ended
I'll be dropping by today
'Cause we could easily get it together tonight
It's only right

Crowded stores, the corner Santa Claus
Tinseled afternoons
And the sidewalk bands that play their songs
Slightly out of tune
On the windy winter avenues
There walks a lonely man
And if I told you who he is
Well, I think you'd understand

But it doesn't have to be that way
What we had should have never have ended
I'll be dropping by today

Jim Croce,"Gonna tell you a story that you won't believe
But I fell in love last Friday evenin'
With a girl I saw on a bar room TV screen
Well I was just gettin' ready to get my hat
When she caught my eye and I put it back
And I ordered myself a couple o' more shots and beers

[Chorus]
The night (you know) that I fell in love with a Roller Derby Queen
(Round 'n' round, oh round 'n' round) 
The meanest hunk o' woman
That anybody ever seen
Down in the arena

She is a five foot six and two fifteen 
A bleached-blonde mama with a streak of mean
She knew how to knuckle
And she knew how to scuffle and fight
And the roller derby program said
That she were built like a 'fridgerator with a head
The fans called her ""Tuffy""
But all her buddies called her ""Spike""

[Chorus]

Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round 
Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round
Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round

Jim Croce,"The railroads and the riverboats
That bred the mighty men
That we read about and we dream about
The men who built this land
And the farmers and the lumbermen
And the men who work the mills
And the poor hard workin' miners
Who died inside the hill

[Chorus]
While the rivers that flow
Are the blood of our land
And the trucks they keep rumbling
On the great concrete band
And the railroads keep pushin'
To be all they once were
And nature is calling
No one's listening to her

And the immigrants by the boat load in a dozen different tongues
Sang of freedom in the new land
Climb the ladder rung by rung
Some to Boston, some to Pittsburgh
Philadelphia and St. Paul
And the old ways led to new days
They were welcome one and all

[Chorus]

With the railroads and the riverboats
And the breadlines far behind
And the days we sang together long gone but still in mind
And the men who came before us
Men who brought us to today
And the story still unravels from the dreams of yesterday

[Chorus]",Railroads and Riverboats
Jim Croce,"How come we can't talk the way we used to do?
Nothing seems to be the same
Have we forgotten all the things we knew
Was it you or I who changed?
We got to find the answer, let the secrets fly
Enough of telling stories and our well meaning lies

Things don't seem to be the same no matter how I tried
There's no rhythm to the rain
Wind still whispers through the leaves on high
But they no longer sing your name

We got to find the answer, let the secrets fly
Enough of telling stories and our well meaning lies
We got to try to build what we had in the past
Trying's half the battle if we lose it, we can't last

I heard myself just say the things, I could never say before
And listen to the rhythm of the rain
Wind just whispered through the leaves on high
And I thought, I heard them sing your name

We got to find the answer, let the secrets fly
Enough of telling stories and our well meaning lies
We got to try to build what we had in the past
Trying's half the battle if we lose it, we can't last

I heard myself just say the things I could never say before

Jim Croce,"Perhaps I'll never show this world all I could be
I just can't sing to any man the song he wants to hear
And I know that some won't like me
Others try to be my friend
But I'm all of me, and that's all that I am

[Chorus]
And if life is for the living
Then why can't men be real
'Stead of hidin' in their costumes
Forgettin' how to feel, forgettin' how to feel

We still live in a time when manners cover what is real
There's a basic fact of life that the times cannot conceal
That if some are masqueraders
Others live in their facade
But I'm what I am
I cannot be what I am not

[Chorus]

I may be too honest and offend those who pretend
I don't claim I'm always right, that I'm ev'rybody's friend
Perhaps for them it's easier to be what they are not
But I'm what I am, and I just can't play that part

[Chorus]",I Am What I Am

Jim Croce,"Well, she was standing by my dressing room after the show
Asking for my autograph and asked if she could go
Back to my motel room. But the rest is just a tragic tale
Because five short minutes of lovin'
Done brought me twenty long years in jail

Well, like a fool in a hurry I took her to my room
She casted me in plaster while I sang her a tune
Then I said, ""Ooh, ooee!"" Sure was a tragic tale

Nights we couldn't say good-bye

Jim Croce,"When I was a boy in the days of the train
I'd sit by the tracks on a long summer day
And I'd wave at the brakesman
And he'd wave back at me
While the thunderclouds rolled
Out of East Tennessee

But the dreams of a boy disappear when you're grown
And though I may dream, the railroads are gone
The ties they are rotten
And the tracks shot to hell
Along with my dreams and the old railroad bell

Workin' diners and farms along the way
Or I'd hop a ride to hide across the border
With a black eyed girl beside me all the way

Now the mountains are silent
And the railroads are gone
And the coal towns no longer hear the miners at dawn
But the train whistle shrills out her memories to me

Jim Croce,"There's ice and snow on the northern roads
And the Jersey Pike is closed
Have to go and do some drivin' tonight
They say I'd be a fool if I would ride those icy roads
But a little storm ain't stoppin' me tonight

I'm gonna wear out the turnpike
Rack up those miles
Keep this rig a rollin', I'm in it every mile
'Cause she's in Oklahoma and
I'm up in Maine
So diesel sing a song that will bring me home again
Doodle doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doodle doo doo doo

There's a red light turnin' behind me
There's a trooper on my tail
I can tell I won't get to New York town on time
If he decides to pull me over
And if he get's me on the scale
I'm gonna have to tell a tale or take a fine

I'm gonna wear out the turnpike
Rack up those miles
Keep this rig a rollin', I'm in it every mile

I'm up in Maine
So diesel sing a song that will bring me home again
Doodle doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doodle doo doo doo

With the snow against my windshield
I will run on through the night
There's not stoppin' me once I hit the road
Cause the turnpike's like my second home
And I know it like my hand
So diesel sing a song that'll bring me home again

Jim Croce,"I drive a broke down rig on ""may-pop"" tires
Forty foot of overload
A lot of people say that I'm crazy
Because I don't know how to take it slow
I got a broomstick on the throttle
I got her opened up and head right down
Nonstop back to Dallas
Poppin' them West Coast turn-arounds

[Chorus:]
And they call me Speedball
Speedball Tucker
Terror of the highways
And all them other truckers
Will tell you that the boy is mad
To be drivin' a rig like that

You know the rain may blow
The snow may snow
And the turnpikes they may freeze
But they don't bother ol' Speedball
He goin' any damn way he please
He got a broomstick on the throttle
To keep his throttle foot a-dancin' round
With a cupful of cold black coffee
And a pocketful of West Coast turn-arounds

[Chorus:]

One day I looked into my rear view mirror
And a-comin' up from behind
There was a Georgia State policeman
And a hundred dollar fine
Well he looked me in the eye as he was writin' me up
And said ""Driver, you been flyin'""
And ""Ninety-five is the route you were on
It was not the speed limit sign""

Maybe we were just too young to know
But now and then
I feel the same,

I hear you calling my name

And now we do not even say hello

Jim Croce,"Snowy nights and Christmas lights
Icy window panes
Make me wish that we could be
Together again
And the windy winter avenues
Just don't seem the same
And the Christmas carols sound like blues
But the choir is not to blame

But it doesn't have to be that way
What we had should have never have ended
I'll be dropping by today
'Cause we could easily get it together tonight
It's only right

Crowded stores, the corner Santa Claus
Tinseled afternoons
And the sidewalk bands that play their songs
Slightly out of tune
On the windy winter avenues
There walks a lonely man
And if I told you who he is
Well, I think you'd understand

But it doesn't have to be that way
What we had should have never have ended
I'll be dropping by today
'Cause we could easily get it together tonight

Jim Croce,"Well the South side of Chicago
Is the baddest part of town
And if you go down there
You better just beware
Of a man named Leroy Brown

Now Leroy more than trouble
You see he stand 'bout six foot four
All the downtown ladies call him ""Treetop Lover""
All the men just call him ""Sir""

And it's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damned town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

Now Leroy he a gambler
And he like his fancy clothes
And he like to wave his diamond rings
In front of everybody's nose
He got a custom Continental
He got an Eldorado too
He got a 32 gun in his pocket for fun
He got a razor in his shoe

And it's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damned town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

Now Friday 'bout a week ago
Leroy shootin' dice
And at the edge of the bar
Sat a girl named Doris
And oo that girl looked nice
Well he cast his eyes upon her
And the trouble soon began
'Cause Leroy Brown learned a lesson
'Bout messin' with the wife of a jealous man

And it's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damned town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

Well the two men took to fighting
And when they pulled them off the floor
Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle
With a couple of pieces gone",Bad Bad Leroy Brown

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair

But baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor

And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Jim Croce,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Careful Man [Harper College 2/5/73] [Live]
Jim Croce,"It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",New York’s Not My Home [Harper College 2/5/73] [Live]

You told my girl who I'm drilling and cutting
Yet it's all for nuthing

Fuck pain and suffering

One of these days
And it won't be long
You'll look for me
And I'll be goin' home
Gotta hold on
Gotta be strong
'cause people don't live that long no more

Now I been off in the cut
I wish I knew from the git
Plenty money on the table
But this thang is a bitch
And can't see nothin
See you blind as hell
This change that I got
Don't mean shit if we don't sell
Forget what ya tell, Playboy
Lookin forward to buyin my momma a crib
And tell it like it is
That's the deal
Decatur been hea'
Stay down what ya feel
I miss my boy every damn day, for real
Seem like last week that ?????? was here
At the crib gettin blown
Damn, I wish I knowned
How this woulda turned out
To have a nigga stressin
I'm prayin every night to thank the Lord for my blessin
Confessin to change, just ain't the same
When it's me
That's hard as steel
I had to lose my folk to see
Resevoirs run dry where ya knees don't bend
I could poor a fifth of Hen
But it ain't enough in the end, 'cause

Look around
How many people here
How many people gone
How many times you done sang that song
It's so hard to say goodbye
That's what we say when the kinfolks die
My homeboy Twain
Oh, he goin through a thang
So let it be known
When momma gone, shit gon' change
I feel his pain
But it don't rain, everyday
Everybody got a life to live
Some choose to play
But regardless how ya live it
Man, we all got to give it
Ain't no need to fight it
Just let God handle his business
Can I get a witness, ha?
I know sometimes I call girls hoes
And I be cussin when I'm bustin my flows
I try to tighten up
But dollar signs keep lightin up
In front of my face
And I can taste it so I'm on this paper chase
Waistin, my precious time
Tryin to paste my grime
Unaware of the finish line
Niggas dyin, 'cause

Hook

Now my past is gone
And my future ain't shit
Might as well hit a lick, 'cause time tick
And split second decisions decide if I live or die
Forever rest face to the sky
Life is like a motor burnin out
You done heard it word a mouth
And in the south everyday a title bout
Between myself and I
Eye to eye without a clue
If it angers me it endangers you
To the point where you got to smoke a joint
'Cause you frustrated
Cussin out the girl you was datin
Nigga, that girl trippin, leave her
She feed you good, keep her
Or smokin on this reefer
I teach her, how to be seen and not be seen
The phone ring, broad tryna' sell me dreams
It's just a fling, but some, don't understand
Some, won't understand
Hash in the hand better than ass in the jean
I gotta get the cheese by any means necassary
Bullshit done got my cousin buried
The way ya carry, done got his life took
The love of money niggas get hooked
Quicker than crack
And that's a fact you find in no book
And you can sho' look
But you won't find none
Life's a card game with no shuffle
I got the bad hand, tryna' bluff
Touchin pain, flushin shit down the drain
Train ya girl to run trains
Now who to blame?

Jim Ed Brown,"(Gunfighter) Marta woke me up that night and she began to cry
She tried to tell me once before about another guy
She held a letter in her hand her body shook with fear
The man she left so long ago at last was riding here
Next day the dark eyed stranger came and called me to the yard
I'd picked up my rusty gun my blood was pounding hard
He said it let me ride away if I give up my wife
But if I chose to stay in draw it have to take my life
Gunfighter who is wrong or right
The man who fights to love or the man who loves to fight

I didn't want to fight the man and I didn't want to run
But slowly he began to count and I went for my gun
Then out of whip his hand lashed out so quick I couldn't see
Before I even touched my gun his bullet burdened me
I felt my strength go leaking out my eyelids turned to red
I watched him aimed the second shot directly at my head
Just then I heard my Marta say gunfigter turn around
She raised my shotgun to her whip and blew him off to ground

And the junk yards and the highways come between us
And some other woman cryin' to her mother cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walking on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind
I dipped my cup of soap back from a gurgling crackling caltron in some train yard
My beard a roughen coal pile and a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands round a tin can I pretend I hold you to my breast and find

Jim Ed Brown,"Out in the west Texas town of El Paso I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Feleena would whirl
Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden I was in love but in vain I could tell
One night a wild young cowboy came in wild as the west Texas wind
Dashing and daring a drink he was sharing with wicked Feleena the girl that I loved
So in anger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down with his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenege was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young strager lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence shocked by the foul deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance that was to run
Out through the backdoor of Rosa's I ran out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one it looked like it could run up on its back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I could from the west Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless everything's gone in life nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death
I saddled up and away I did go riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet will find me tonight nothin's worse than this pain in my heart
And at last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward down off the hill to Feleena I go
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting I can't let them catch me I have to make it to Rosa's backdoor
Something is dreadfuly wrong for I feel a deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle I'm getting weary unable to ride
But my love for Feleena is strong and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary I can's stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle I feel the bullet go deep in my chest
From out of nowhere Feleena has found me kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for one little kiss then Feleena goodbye

He says get up gotta rise and shine through my gloom
I better face myself gotta brace myself to go on

I can't help but listen and then realize the words you have spoken are beautiful lies

I see red roses blooming a rainbow in the sky
All sweet things come to me and the twinkle of an eye
When you hold and tell me those beautiful lies

Jim Ed Brown,"When I noticed her the first time I was outside running barefoot in the rain
She lived in the house next door her nose was pressed against the window pane
When I looked at her she smiled and showed a place where two teeth used to be
And I heard her ask her mom if she could come outside and play with me
Soon the days of sand and shovels gave way to the mysteries of life
Then I noticed she was changing and I looked at her through different eyes
We became as one and knew a love without beginning or an end
And everyday I lived with her was like a new day dawning once again
And I've loved her since every doll was Shirley Temple soda pop was still a nickel
Jam was on her fingertips milk was circled on her lips
After many years our love grew silent and at night I heard her cry
And when she left me in the fall I knew that this would be our last goodbye
I was man enough to give her everything she needed for a while
But in searching for a perfect love I found that I could not give her a child
Now she lives a quiet life and is a mother of a little girl
And every time I pass her house my thoughts go back into another world
Cause I see her little girl her nose is pressed against the window pane
And she thinks I'm a lonely man who wants to come inside out of the rain

Said to me think big and prosper win a Grammy or an Oscar
Make it big and be someone so that's what I've gone and done
But it all seem empty after awhile

For all the world is cold and lonely fame and fortune made me only
Realize life's greatest charms are those you can't hold in your arms
And now that I've been through it all I know that life is made of

For I've got everything that life
Has to offer in my hands

And silver creeps into her hair

Where life began when we were young last night
I feel your back pressed close to me
And hear your steady breathing as you sleep

Then as the first soft glow of dawn moves silver gray
Like paint along the wall
I touch your hand and feel your ring
And know this night is all we'll ever have

Suddenly, I look into your sleepy eyes
You breathe my name and it just seems to dangle there
Then I feel your fingers running through my mind
Jumbling up my thoughts to leave them tangled there

I know so well that this is all there is
And when we leave this room, it's gone
My mind is clear as we walk down
The crooked little steps to the front door

From off a rooftop light our stumbling way
I touch your hand and feel your ring
And know this night is all we'll ever have

From a woman who said she was through

When I heard my child in prayer.

To stay old fashioned with me

Jim Gaffigan,"You pulled up and parked your El Dorado
We said ""hi"" and kissed with some bravado
I got out my camera and was laughing
Happy it was you I'm photographing

And we drove to the ferry
Like the cat and canary
I said, ""Baby, it's scary
When it's so beautiful

Why does it hurt me
To feel so much tenderness?
Beautiful
You little wonder, you""

Maybe then I held your hand and kissed you
I know once I just hauled off and hit you

'Cause I can't even stand it
'Cause I don't want to end it
To be perfectly candid ?
Baby, you're beautiful

Sometimes it hurts me
To feel so much tenderness
Beautiful
Wish you could see it, too

And all I have to do today
Is make you happy
The only thing you have to say
Is, ""It's all lovely, baby""

Late that night, we checked into the Bellevue
Held you close, but, baby ? couldn't tell you

And we stayed in our Calvin's
And we swore we'd be best friends
And I looked through the zoom lens
And thought you were beautiful

Sometimes it hurts me
To feel so much tenderness
Beautiful
Baby, I'm dazzled
By the view
Beautiful
You don't need to tell me
I'm completely powerless
Beautiful
I wish you could see it, too [Repeat: x3]
Baby, how I see you",Beautiful

With your wings frayed and torn,
Laughter's your's so is scorn
As they point to you in shame.

With your wings near fire,
But confess when your tire,
Is the candle worth the flame?

There's not a hear to really call your own;
So before it's too late, 
Change your ways and repent,
Take my love that was meant

Jim Galloway,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You
Jim Galloway,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me
Jim Galloway,"Sadness just makes me sigh,
I've come to say goodbye,
Altho' I go, I've got those farewell blues.
Those farewell blues make me yearn,
That parting kiss seems to burn.
Farewell, dearie, Someday I will return.
Dreaming of you is sweet,
Someday again we'll meet.

Jim Galloway,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way
Jim Galloway,"Sleep, sleep, sleep
How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep
While we sleep, sleep, sleep
It seems that daytime was just made for laughter and song
Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep
How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep

Sunday morning
Sun shining from your eyes
Sleepy face 
Smiling into mine

Sunday morning
Lots of time with nothing to do
Lots of time to spend with you
On Sunday morning

We can hear the sound of feet walking by
I'll put coffee on to brew
We can have a cup or two
And do what other people do

I love Sunday, Sunday morning

Come hold me in your arms
I love you

Wishing is good time wasted,
Still it's a habit they say,
Wishing for sweet's I've tasted,
That's all I do all day.
Maybe there's nothing in wishing,
But, speaking of wishing I'll say,

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

No one could be sweeter
Than my sweetie when I meet her
In the morning.

When the morning glories
Twine around the door
Whispering pretty stories
I long to hear once more
Strolling with my girlie
Where the dew is pearly early
In the morning.

Butterflies all flutter up
And kiss each little buttercup
At dawning.
If I had Aladdin's lamp
For only a day
I'd make a wish
And here's what I'd say

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

Dreaming was meant for night time
I live in dreams all the day, 
I know it's not the right time,
But still I dream away
What could be sweeter than dreaming,

Jim Gibson,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I,
""You do not know, silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed 
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming
And the signs said, 
""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence",The Sounds of Silence
Jim Gibson,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall

She gave your very first kiss to you

Hope them ho's puckerup tryna get them to slide
that's on our mind getting high all the time (we tryna fuck!)
We hustle hard, hope the fiends buy all the dimes
So we can scoop up and hit the party and scoop a bitch (get twisted)
You know the drill homie
Play the rules and play the field but don't get killed homie (stay alive)
So where's the better days?
The have to get up days to cheff up yay just to get us paid (we hustle hard)
You see never it fails most of my homies either dead or jail (gone)
Don't fuck with phonies cause they get you killed (ah ah)
My testimony's every bitter real (thats right)
don't run up on me cause I'm gripping steel (bang bang)
I'm kinda nervous and I'm quick on the blast
due to the murders that I witnessed in town

Look what the ghetto's did to me (Baby)
And when you finish running the streets
I'll be the only one that you gonna run to

Got a cuses that want some pies 23 a slice
Transactions by the building, uptown Harlem world, Manhattan where we kill them (Taz)
Plus my project way of thinking spending most my days drinking
It's like I'm on my way to sixton (lock in)
But we do what we do that's survival
And we move how we move that's through the rivals (fuck them enemies)

That's for the soldiers that we lost in the mist of this war (RIP Life)
For the ones on the grind and front line they got called by po nine
And now they prisoners of war
They fight for appeal or a bill or a ball
Cause they slipped and got nailed for a sale of a rob (Zeek you know wassup)
Two shouts for O.B.C.C six main house of fame
When you come home come and see me
Stay cool I lay the rules on ya
Play the fool and they will move on ya

Jim Jones,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word

Jim Jones,"Got this problem with these niggaz on the other side of town
Plus my little homey Pop-la-di he's a rider now
So you know he want some answers off top he ridin down
With them automatic weapons, load and fire in the pound (bang bang)
Hood devastated, prayin that they let him make it
Heard it 'bout the incident, it's crazy how he just got faded (it's fucked up)
But it's better places, G's call it heaven's Matrix
Pray the Lord open up, they told me how heaven's gated (let a thug in)
Certified, decorated
Murder never hesitated, I heard it was premeditated (who told you that)
And my whole hood segregated
Harlem World's so small, but my whole ghetto dedicated (Eastside, Westside)
We was young, loose cannons
Shoot cannons, point aim, broad day, wherever you standin' (fuck that do it now)
We live our life as a G
Day and, night with the heat, rollin' dice on the street
Now come on

[Chorus: x4]
Do doves fly, when thugs cry?
Here's a story 'bout the trials and tribulations of this thug life

Now, play the game, know the code, say no names
Fast life ain't no game, R.I.P. Baby Main
He was large in the game, slingin' thangs
Shiny rings, diamond chains, he's a star in my hood (he was ?)
All the cars, V12 by the hood
Had the jets, had the strip, had the power, he was livin' that life
New whips every hour, it's a shame, in my hood
He'll be missed like the Towers in the midst of the prowess
Not to put his business out there (uh-huh)
But the kid'll make you think that Po Rich was out here (like '86)
And in these stories it mainly contain the lobby
About the young and the restless like Harlem's main ?

[Chorus]

We light and chill, each night we would chill
Block number, fifty ? seven, movin' white for them bills
Stashin' open rice for it stales, I tried to tell you
That my life is so real, they dog me in and bring me home nine-trey
Took the city on my own crime raid (N.Y.C.)
Invadin' clubs, with brazy bloods (tell 'em)
Tell Peter Geisha what's up, back to the saga, when Light got killed
It's like one side of my life is killed, for real
And Chills turned state fed, couldn't deal with a state bed
But snitchin' breaks the code, gotta lie in your made bed (you know the rules)
No sympathy homey, you gotta follow them codes
You get a thousand years of die in that hole (G's up)

Call my G's when I got to move
'Cause I drop 100 G's when I dropped the Coupe

Niggaz found a way tryna take my life
'Cause I run 'round the way wit' a neck full of ice
Gotta bunch of doggs and I set 'em to bite
So if you niggaz want war we can do it tonight

I'm prayin' to the Lord that optimize
Dip Set Byrd Gang know I'ma ride
And I'ma rep till my last breath
Take a pull of my last hit

Pull up on these niggaz and blast the bitch
East side when I mask the bitch

I'm kinda nervous and I'm quick on the blast
Due to the murders that I witnessed in town

Livin' the life with a rider seems
It's the only thing that I'm gonna run to
That's when you light and get high with me
Look what the ghetto's did to me
(Baby)

And when you finish running the streets
I'll be the only one that you gonna run to
Just getting paper and ducking police
Look what the ghetto did to me
(Uh, yeah, yeah)

There was no peace in sight

It was sleepless night
(Yup)
Hustling ya breaking day to see the light

Got a causes that want some pies 23 a slice
Transactions by the building, uptown Harlem world
Manhattan where we kill them

Plus my project way of thinking spending most my days drinking
It's like I'm on my way to sexton
(Lock in)
But we do what we do that's survival
And we move how we move that's through the rivals

Do your thang slang cane and get your bucks on your steps

They have you in your cell man serving life for that

(Uh, yeah, yeah)

Now for my project corners, go hard for warrants
(Fuck 'em)
Every night I make it, I pray to God for goners
(I pray to God)
We pour liquor on floors that's for the soldiers
That we lost in the mist of this war
(RIP Life)

For the ones on the grind and front line they got called by po nine
And now they prisoners of war they fight for appeal or a bill or a ball
'Cause they slipped and got nailed for a sale of a rob
(Zeek you know wassup)

Two shouts for O.B.C.C six main house of fame
When you come home come and see me
Stay cool I lay the rules on ya
Play the fool and they will move on ya
Young niggaz that keep them tools on ya

They quick to let them blickas blast

So crazy the way we get this cash

Now we set them presidents, to get them presidents
Over the ones that are dead, we'll put guns to your head
Put dots on your loaf like you was wonder the bread
Sheek, Zeke, hell rell and I got some in the feds

I contradict what ever the government says
For them boys on my back wit them bugs by my bed
They still thinkin' that we coppin' sellin raw
Tryin' to put us through them Rico and them Rockefeller' laws

I'm in L.A. the top down the pedals floored
Wit a hot stiletto whore, suck my cock tell the law
And for you fagots I see past all your cheap stares
Nowadays I see my past from a beach chair, yeah

And I the fellin' so relaxed and refreshin' when chillin'
A total change from movin' crack off the steps of the building's
Rollin' wit gangs in the back of the jects where the killin'
In Park Ave where young Chris body found
A number is all to add to task body count
Watch it boy they'll show you how that shorty bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce

I'm the most incredible, to ever do what you cats'll never do, or be able to
I'm ahead of you, 'cause I spit like I never ate
And if I did then I'm just never full
Stop the hoe jokes, I'm not a homo, better believe I'll cock the 4-4
I ain't Mexican, but I'll stretch your man, yes I am a fuckin' vato loco

I went from the pot with cocoa to the block with cocoa
To gettin' locked, catchin' a charge dealin' wit the cops with cocoa
Now I'm just hot like cocoa
You can catch me on the block, being watched, in a drop
The same color as chocolate cocoa

I don't walked in the street, with so much raw in my sneaks
God dam, got home and had corns on my feet
I see the Lord when I sleep and often He speaks
He says Juelz you better than all of these creeps

So I got all my shit light, got on my shit right
Not a lot of thems this nice, but the games funny so I gotta do shit right
So to the ball drop and the world blow up, I'm a twirl shit up
Until my peeps come home, Zeke come home
Better believe I'm a keep on beastin' on

Where should I began our pompous, a thousand wins accomplished
Known throughout the atlas, honest been accomplished
You'll be abolished, men, women, children astonished
The don is the one, jewelry way beyond it

Chunky blessed on the chest, funky S when I dress
Thunder storm damn, monkey wrenching' her fresh
But I cope wit the rain, mad I can't float with my dame
Down to the coastal wit Caine, Maine, my boat is a plane

I land on the water, here I go boastin' again
I keep toast, give a toast, inhale smoke for the pain
Girls gone wild, nope, they goin' insane
All doped off the fame, jump rope with my chain

Now that's off the chain, ma take off your chain
I'm 40 will off your brain, kids will be lost and claimed
'Cause of Walton James, now in the orphan game
Whether adoption or foster it's all the same

Jim's the rider of riders, J are's the writer of writers
Juelz you know him well, hell he the fire of fire
I'm the supplier, baffled that's the hustler
Trifle got a knife for that apple inside your jugular

The big apple, I tackle all the customers
Put it on the apple at the castle, come and fuck with us
And further more, got the birds of raw, I deserve a tour
Hey, hey holla' back, swallow that, that's murda' whore

In a Persian turban, swervin', that suburban mergein'
Curvin', herb in the air, yeah, yeah I'm hurtin' y'all
See I crash and cop it, mash and mop it, blast a rocket
Natural born hustler, yeah crack I stocked it

Now my drugs are legal, so just pass the profit
Three months alone sizzurp will smash the notic
We them be boys in one year a quarter billion
Here come the clothin' line, I got your order children
And that's more than illin', long as the Lord is willin'

Shit, make 'em believe in this prophecy (movement)
You can see I'm tryin to lead my democracy (Dip-Set)
To get money and rip sleeve off of my city (New York)
And slow down, then try to breeze through the projects be	 (Taft)
And how I speeds in velocity (160)

My man caught 10, couldn't find the keys to the lobby be	
The boys rushed him, 2 keys of mahogany (Damn!)
In my life you can't see me not possibly (Nooo!)
How we swoop up in Harlem, 20 Coupes when we mobbin'
40 troops if it's problems (What Nowww!)
Cause 1 nigga you know is a shotgun driver (jus 1 nigga)
Ready to dump triggers, that shotgun fire (blakka!)
I ain't gone front nigga I shot some guys up
(didn't kill 'em though, fuck 'em though)
And they came back to my block like riders (Yop!)
But I'm like ""Crouching Tiger"", spin, roll, crouch and fire (Boom, Yea!)
A fast retally (Uh Huh!)
Now it's cash we tally
Miami, Atlanta, fuck it we smash to Cali (L.A.X.!)
Back on L.A. Ave, you know the Lennox strip
Where they Henny sip
Beef we let the semi rip

And in a Dip-Set mansion is where ya girl be found (hollaaa!)
How can a pearl be drowned (yea)
How can a diamond not shine (uh huh)

But I don't fuck wit no bitch if she ain't worth no chips or no cabbage

[Verse 3]
I'm so problematic (yeah)
And do to servin' Harlem-matics (damn)
My fame and fortune still revolve wit' static (that beef)
Still involve wit' savage types that move drugs
365 all around set every night (perrico)
I ain't the passive type (nope)
On the benches where I crashed them nites (movin')
Blowin' hemp, movin' slabs of white (hustlin')
Spend days up in court
How I shaved weight to snort
Give that to the press or Dave Mays in the source (suttin to read about)
Yes, since success it has changed
Since we, stepped up in this game and stepped up wit' our game (ballin')

Jim Jones,"I seen it all from a player's eyes
Look at this world from my latest ride
We knock 'em all if you let this slide
This how you ball if you a major guy
With alcohol and a hazy high

The city lights in the jaded sky
I had this girl, wanna make her mine
I can't lie, I was interested in her
We shared a bed in the club and even crept to dinner

It's such a funny situation
'Cause I knew she had a man in the ave by reputation
I get around I'm just a product of my occupation
I asked her number and she contemplated
I'm losin' patience and it's startin' to get flagrant

Seize the moment or forever regret it
Three in the mornin' and I'm stressin' to catch her
Creepin' up on her and applyin' the pressure
Me and my homey A don't think I can get her, uh but

It's crazy, smooth ghetto angel so amazin'
Smokin' gettin' high with the daisy
Thinkin' 'bout makin' you my lady, maybe
You're a bad girl, she say I only want her for my pleasure
Slow hit it from the back, I do it better
She left me with a kiss and I let her, never sweat her

You seekin' love is watchin' movies on and off the stations
Those commercials was our intermissions
For the [Incomprehensible] and the tongue-kissin' and one instance
Turns some heated touchin' to some freaky fuckin'

My situation is a bit of trouble
See this affair is a bit of struggle
And my persona and my thuggish morals
That was enough to start a lover's quarrel

Since she had a man but he wasn't loyal
Got loose enough just to open up
It be the mornin 'fore he sober up
I call the shit like Punky Brewster
And she never met a thug loser
Star nigga party with the snub shooter

My thug True is probably posted in back
We party hard, get so crazy
And we smoke and drink 'gnac
I'm tryin' to slide in the night on some smutty sex
Niggaz beepin' my phone to ask me did I get her yet

It's crazy, smooth ghetto angel so amazin'
Smokin' gettin' high with the daisy
Thinkin' 'bout makin' you my lady, maybe
You're a bad girl, she say I only want her for my pleasure
Slow hit it from the back, I do it better
She left me with a kiss and I let her, never sweat her

It's gettin' nervous now 'cause the word in town
Is that your man got the word that we done flirtin' 'round
In your Beemer merkin' 'round foreplay in the hallways
So now we hit the house and pull the curtains down

We laugh and we joke, we drink and I pass you the smoke
Smack your ass when you walk, when fuckin' I grab and you joke
Have sex at night as we lay and we chill
Your crib, nice apartment, who's payin' the bills

This type of shit'll get you sprayed and you killed
That's that Harlem shit like Mitch shot in 'Paid in Full'
This is not a movie script, some of my truest shit
Selfish premonition, out of sight I'm out of mind
When this nigga gone and missin'

Wishin' she mine, I'm knowin' that she'll never be
This'll be fine, the closest that I'll ever be
I see a chick and she mine, new Goldie of the ghetto be
Niggaz beepin' my phone to ask me did I get her yet

It's crazy, smooth ghetto angel so amazin'
Smokin' gettin' high with the daisy
Thinkin' 'bout makin' you my lady, maybe

When that wreck came around, I'm in the trench with my pound

Man, fuck all that, I don't know what that's about but fuck all that
Jim, I'm in the building
Dipset, it's your turn, you up nigga!
Let's go!

I'm puffin' my weed and these niggaz, they mad
I'm frontin' this season
As far as they hoes, they want me to see 'em
I fuck 'em and then they don't want me to leave 'em
An addictive obsession, I twist 'em, I sex 'em
My dick's an obsession
They call me, they miss me, they stressin'
I call 'em, they miss me, they stressin'

These hoes, they sayin' that shit that'll kill ya
I'm rich now, this kid look familiar
As far as my Dips, we rich the cars and the whips
We spent what you spent on your car on my wrist
Don't bother me bitch
In the midst of this grind, I'm twistin' my lime
I'm 'bout to get cash, and you can kiss ass
Dipset got this shit up on smash

This is Jim Jones, he's breezin' on chrome
Ya best bet is leave him alone
O.G. in them stones, spent G's on them stones
Now mami just send me the tone

These are true stories, I used to live poorly
And now man I live in two stories
Get suited in Maury, the coupe is Ferrari
The coupe cost 140, you don't wanna race, I will move on you shorty
Look good on them cameras
They love me, I put my whole hood up on cameras
They bloody, niggaz in hood with them blamas
Tell me, so do it for grandma

We did it from druggin' and [Incomprehensible]
We did it from hustlin' and comin' up wrong
We did it from strugglin' and comin' up strong
Still runnin' with cons, with guns in their palms
You front on Dipset, we will dump on your moms
Or come through with bombs and stop and park
And set off them bombs

This is Jim Jones, he's breezin' on chrome
Ya best bet is leave him alone
O.G. in them stones, spent G's on them stones
Now mami just send me the tone

You got to admit I'm hot when I spit
Like a summertime's tropic's eclipse
Like a drop on the strip with no top on the whip
A block it yeah I put with them cops on the strips
With glocks on their hip
Like shells when they drop when them shots get dismissed
The pain in my heart been my aim from the start
We started when we came from the star

Now we all gainin' on charts
With back to back hits, like Yankees an' shit
Dipset, we gangsta as shit but I credit my ghetto
'Cause now we rock platinum, the preciousest metal
Don't press us, we'll press on this metal and blow you apart
Shoulda known from the start
My jewels, they glow in the dark
You fools, keep playin' ya part

This is Jim Jones, he's breezin' on chrome
Ya best bet is leave him alone
O.G. in them stones, spent G's on them stones
Now mami just send me the tone

Turn'em up a little more, turn'em up a little, yeah there we go yeah, uh yeah

[Bizzy Bone]
Born in the poverty probably we never get off the monopoly, won't we just stop it 
With all the monotony, look at me awkwardly hide my broccoli, nigga what
Fuck the media, how could you come to me, follow me, bother me, tell me to simmer it down
Part of the system is worser now, melody murder must've ran
What if the rapture happens, nigga just deeper than rapping vanish or not
Never gone change my style, I do what I wanna pop, 'til the ""Body Rot"" stop
Generation X, I am the mastermind, general militants seven times, revolution rebellious, totally out of line
I still in the mind of apocalyptic, biblical optimistic
Thank my lucky stars, never I say my graces, I'm so thankful god
Take me to the promise land, all I see is cops with guns
Soap in my sock, county charges stuck in the struggle with number one
Never will have a friend like me, reality checking the crooked judge
Man because the rapping is over, we fucking soldiers, we fucking thugs
And ain't nobody stopping my fucking drugs
If I can melt down the words, and put them in plastic sucks, rip it to the nation, let it go what, what
Bitch I would speak your mind, even if they offended you 'cous
Ride off in the sun set, with the streets niggas 'cause that's who I love
Standing next to Capo twin towers shoot up to the heaven sky
We rolling down the ninety-five, take the bridge, I'm ready to die..................

[Bizzy Bone]
For the grace of Capo... for the grace of Capo, in the moment of silence, 
Now the grace of Capo, in the moment of silence, in the mist of tyrants and silence,
And the demon malignancies, motherless children are born, poppa the one who murdered her,
Witness the vision first hand plumping master of source of us

[Jim Jones]
By the, grace of Capo, in the moment of silence, in the mist of tyrants and violence,
I'm flossing my diamonds, by the grace of Capo, in he mist of the hood, and it should be all good,
But murders go down, you know they go down

[Jim Jones]
Straight out the projects be, I'm telling ya'll it was so hard for me (so hard)
Coming up hard in these Harlem streets, where niggas will starve, cause it's hard to eat
Some niggas will rob in the hardcore streets, ridiculous all it's hard concrete (watch it)
Bitches the boosters the credit card scammers, niggas that shoot cause they all gone blame us
People they shoot cause they cocky 'bout scanners (scwalay!) 
So if watch where the birds fly, (watch it) don't speed when you swerve high
Cause believe me the third eye, put the squeeze on your whole ride (lock down)
See I'm always in the rear view, see the law in your rear view (what else) pray to the lord he can hear you (why)
I'm the nigga on the corner, plus my niggas on the corner bring same shit
Three carry gripes in the crime in heaven, I'm in this Fahrenheit called 9/11
When I go to the cross roads, lord knows Ferrari white, mean highway to heaven (forgive them lord)
And these digital times, we all need to have a political mind (that's right)
Federology, technology, and we can shine like astrology (they can see from the stars)
When we walking on eggshells, when you talk on next cells (what happens)
When you talking on fed cells (listen to me) and we all on sex cells (whooo)
When the drugs and rock-n-roll, and when the drugs lock your soul
Don't blame it on 'caine, got rich when the reggae came (that's right)
Bill Clinton rejuvenated us (yeah), all been the Bush's hoovernated us (stupid)
Police will soon be chasing us (that's right), the streets they be afraid of us (yeah)
From cutting up raw, from frying up coke, give a fuck about war
We ain't trying to voting (voting)
So if you draft me jail me (you hear that)
Or better yet kill me (uh-huh) 'cause I rather go to hell be, and there's nothing you can tell me
Cause we risking ourselves, just sit in the cell, over punk as nigga in cells (damn)
All the grief in the cells, spin on shelves, I'm running out of time, cause I'm living in hell (yeah)

[Jim Jones]
By the, grace of Capo in this moment of silence, in the mist of the violence, the mist of tyrants,
Flossing my diamonds......yeah, by the grace of Capos nigga, you heard, that's two strong armies nigga
Two under bosses we can't be stopped, we will not be brought down like the twin towers
We some political soldiers ghettolutionists, we freedom fighters

Run up in ya crib there's a safe up in it

These niggas beefin' and kissin' and then they make-up
Shit, I still prowl through the gutta
All you hear em say is that's a wild motherfucka'
Its been a while muh'fucker
Had to fall back, face trial cause of Rucker
One-Eyed Willie, you can come try kill me
Still ridin that 5, you can get hung high silly

We pop bottles and we all smoke weed
And we'll burn this bitch down, better call po-lice
And y'all know y'all don't want that beef
I'm tryna G-Mack look at all these freaks
Besides, the dance floor look sweet
So like Lil' Jon we can all skeet skeet
I'm tryna bag this bimbo
Mad she spilled her drink on the tan Timbo's
Stuntin' hard in my be-Boy pose
You ain't got nothin' on me dogs ain't V I ain't drove
Fuck about the law top-speed on the road
.44 squeeze, breathe, reload
And if I gotta take it that far
That mean I left the club nigga and went straight to the car

I live a hard rock life
Mix a whole pot til that hard rock white
Six 4-5, hard top white
Big 4-5 for you hard rocks aight
And my advice to the buyers
Although the City's hot I rock ice through the fire
Listenin' to Pac, live life like rider when I pull up to the block fiends 
Wipin' off the tires
So I got to be the hardest
15th and Lennox when my posse in the projects

G's up nigga, ho's down 
If the bitch can't swim she gon'drown 
Runnin' the streets totin' the 4 pound 
You didn't know we was them niggas, the nigga you know now (dipset) 

I had to fade 'm into black 
Hit 'm with the crossover made 'm jump back 
And before all that 
I used to make 'm pump crack 
Ridin' shotgun in the ?? slum back 
Max leave the streets, please the don't want that 
They need me in the shit 
The .40 cals is mine, the nina's we could split 
Cock back, squeeze off, started feedin 'm with the 5th 
And you couldn't really hide, cause I seen that nigga trip 
You ain't seen a nigga flip 
Until they bank 50 g's and you feed a nigga shrimps 
39, 40 and you feed a nigga strips 
Beat the nigga bitch, 
Till she bleedin' from the lips, yeah 
Got me speedin' in the six 
Drunk off the hen, breezin in the mist 
Chicks believin' in the dick, dick 
Feenin'for a sniff 
Got me needin' for a spliff 
Ain't a thing funny, when you fucking with this money 
I'm a lean you off a cliff, G's up

The picture gettin' clearer 
If it was bricks than the strip we had to tear it up 
If it's beef, the .45th we had to gear 
Lookin' at my life through this rear viewer mirror 
Burnin' in the pike in this brand new Carrera 
The game funny, mo' money it's gets weirder 
My gang hungry, no money that we scared off 
And do us both a favor my nigga, and don't compare us 
We still loosin soldiers at this war 
Like every other week I'm pourin cold drinks at the floor 
We just lost iky, he was going to the store 
That's why I roll around the fully loaded in the door 
Majority time, I'm tryna stay above the poverty line 
And that's a major part of my grind 
I still hit the hood and park my car in the nine 
While the little niggas pump hard with dimes 

[Chorus]

The say success is like amen (pray for me) 
You see police will arrest us while we rollin' 
We stay on heat so if you press we ain't foldin 
You see me in the streets so there ain't no question bout ?

We pimpin' easy 
Niggas hate, come teach me 
The niggas with the big cake they couldn't reach me (I know) 
Now when they see us, they kick game, everything all peachy 
Snitch niggas put 'm beneath me, believe me 

Fuck 'em I can't let them break me 
A ? and a man is what it makes me 
I rather ride in the lambo's and the AC 
Top down, stoppin' for nothing, coming through frollin' 

I tryna to be, one of these niggas that do it for nothin'
I got a passion for this shit cause I love it 
Like a piece of pussy when I'm fuckin, waitin to come

Shot out to Taft where them killas is made
We was out on the Ave., young dealin' that gay
Tryin' to get cash pumpin' crills to get payed
Alcohol in my glass blunt filled up with haze

We congregated in front them grocery stores
Sellin' crack held gats and conversate while we smoked the raw
And sit on crates like they lay-Z boys
The strip we wait like the 80's boy

And whip up 8th in the latest toy like it's the only thing to do
You know the house parties you had to bring your crew
And you know we stay fly Pelle leather with the boots
And niggaz shake the dice and call you bet out 'fore you shoot

You lookin' scared, money fall better to the deuce
We would set up on the stoop, gettin' wet up on the stoop
And watch the dust fiends gettin' wet up off the juice
Tryin' to get up off that loot so we could get up on the coupes

I wish Harlem Lee was still around
You know the jam packed traffic buggin' out in front of Willie's Lounge
I been doing this since Nucleus was open
Coppin', they black well who knew what we was smokin'

Took a few pulls had you movin' slow motion
Walkin' pass the Carter, now it's pokie still smokin'
And I could still picture the sports bar
Niggaz think they hot shit whippin' up in the sports car

State building jams, remember Farraqan had that fake million man
Copped the fly jackets from Carlos at the mall
Or be in King Domes poppin' bottles in the park
Don't play on 40th cause they'll rob you after dark

Wolf pack gang don't jog Central Park
F.T.W fuck the world
Drinkin' 40's got us fucked up till we earl

Somebody tell Cuda, let me in this cherry lounge
This ain't Queens homie you surrounded by deadly grounds
And I was downtown just watchin' the caine flip
Heard a nigga from the west side was fuckin' my same bitch

But them bitches didn't care
Just tryin' to get some cash buy some sneakers fix they hair
Ride up Lennox Ave. you smell the reffer in the air
3rd Ave. viva Puerto Rico the Boricua fair

African parade every year, the whole block is there
You want raw yay, Broadway you go cop it there
Shit, and we can cruise autobahn, go buy the rawest chron
Or around the clock baby even 4 in the morn'

The summer time, we still illin' on them
God they clear the whole 7th, poppin' wheelies on them squads
Terror Squad still got the hottest team in the Rucker
Look real close, you can see it from the brucker

When I'm dippin on the grind I get my money quick
But sometimes I wanna lay up wit my honey dip
She be wit me cause she aint like all them other chicks
Let you hit, then she split, that's why I got a honey dip
From the club to the telly you know how it is
Most of the chicks I never tell em where a nigga live
Tryna reach me at my mansion or my mother crib
Hit my cell, hit my two, now I'm at my honey dips

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Yo we talked about 8, said I was comin thru to hit
Now its wee hours in the mornin and I'm drunker than a bitch
Stumblin and shit, I jumped up in the whip
Flipped open the horn like where's my honey dip
And bitch fuck ya man tonite, you know my steelo
Sizzurp wit the Cristal, the corners playin cee-lo
You see me well you jus smile you know we on the le-low
I'm whippin thru the town like we boilin up a kilo
Huh, I'm tryna dip up in the tele
Dip up in the room, then dip up in her belly
Dip off on Pirelli's, Dip-Sets Fonzarelli
My white t-shirt, lookin dip up in my Pelle
Smokin weed up in the Range
Full speed left lane

But I'm no dummy, most these bunnies

So after the brother hit
I'll tell a honey dip
She won't see a contact, address nor buddy list
I aint on some hubby shit
That lovey dovey shit its nuttin trick I'm suttin slick you couldn't get
enough of it
How a slugger jus slide up thru the check in

Hundred diamonds on my neck and wrist shit

Watch how I do this stupid grindin and perfectin
Who's flyer when I step in got em spyin every second, cause that 06
Charger remind em of a 7
Yes man I'm so fresh the pro mess wit bread honey
My jeans 800, these are called Red Munkey

Throw singles at other hoes in the strip club wit me
She do anything for jus one quicky

For this slow dick
She give no lip, she jus go get
The paper I ask her for, my bitch so quick
Plus she know every Santana song and she don't mind puttin the damn bandana on
Slap her ass tell her dance in this thong
She do it all for daddy
She move it all for daddy...Aye Aye
She get a brick and she boof it all for daddy
Hit the road shake the State Troopers off for daddy
And she bring all that paper back
No short paper back, she sure don't play wit that

Or maybe it's because I keep my pants off my ass

I am my own boss, I only answer for cash
I only fear the law, so fuck a man with a badge
And I'm tryin' to duck the law dogs I'm gettin' indicted
They done showed me the money, shit the kid got excited

So if the kid get an inch, well, I'm takin' a yard
And if the kid do get bitch, well, I'm takin' a yard
That's till the day that I'm charged
We be leavin' out the club, my crew racin' the cars
Who's at your favorite broad

Catch that boy Capo
Cruisin' up 8th with the top low and the cops low
I'm a DipSet boss
You don't wanna get clapped, get caught up in the cross

And I'm caught up in the floss
Chain 500 thou' 'cause I'm brought up in the gloss
And I'm caught up in the cross
I'm a winner, I ain't tryin' to get caught up with a loss

I done ran through most clubs that they have in my city
Dancin' in the spot with my hammer getting pissy
One hand up on the bitch other hand on my blizzy
I kicked my G mac, tryin' to slip her a mickie

Lord, help the boy they tryin' get me
Always pull me over they be dyin' to frisk me
Car smell like weed and I be reakin' of liquor
Told me I was free but they see I'm the nigga

I gotta leave 'em one bigger
I said I'm from a hood where police gettin' hit up
Get up, let's not make it a issue
But if a nigga piss me off I'm goin' straight to the pistol

Then we could make it official
Next time you see ya mama
Won't be awake when she kiss you
I'm just tryin' to get some paper
And avoid all the haters

Catch that boy Capo
Cruisin' up 8th with the top low and the cops low
I'm a DipSet boss
You don't wanna get clapped, get caught up in the cross

And I'm caught up in the floss
Chain 500 thou' 'cause I'm brought up in the gloss
And I'm caught up in the cross
I'm a winner, I ain't tryin' to get caught up with a loss

Now we try corners
Old folks try and warn us
The cops try and swarm us
Blocks hot like saunas
Well fuck it I'm a risk it
Got a bunt nigga twist it
I'm a get drunk with my biscuit
5 cent cup, take a sip kid
I'm a product of the p-jects
My teachers always told me that I'd prolly be a reject
I came up by my lonely now I'm a product of that D-Set
Two twelvin' with my homie, he caught a homy of that d-wreck
He said it had him zonin' left the body in building three steps
The project now on fire every where you see the detects
His high is coming down cause now he's nervous smokin bogeys
And now he findin' out that fuckin' murder was his co-D
And this the shit that happens all too often up in Harlem
No shit you smell a rat you better off him what's the problem
In this business sellin' crack we cook that raw shit up to hard shit
And tell my fellas that and to my coffin steady mobbin' to my coffin
Steady mobbin'

[Chorus]
Take a look into my eyes and you'll see all the pain the ghetto brings
Take a journey through my soul and lets
Roll through the streets of reality
They tell me slow down I'm livin' life fast See they don't all wanna
Ride with me
I know it ain't right but this is my life
It's just a piece of my diary yeah


Now, we ran reckless, no grown-ups to guide us
So it's the man what you expect, I've grown-up to violence
I had my eye up on the pushers, the ones that stay fly
Fiends got high off the suga, you know that ain't right
That sweet cane, some got buried to the street game
My niggas only worried bout the jewelry and the street fame
And what the bitches thought of them, it's all about the money
Well shit I cop some Porsche or trucks
'Member I was hungry, I was whippin' in the Corsica
Hoopty motherfucka', hoppin the double four's
My pants droopy motherfuckas
And pardon my grammar, my nana died '95
So I done left my heart wit my grandma
I hid outside and played the park wit the hammer
And I'm watchin' for the narcs, they movin' cars with antennas
Thug and respect, for all my goons behind bars in the slammas
To my G's on rikers, to all my three time lifers

[Chorus]

[Repeat: x2]
This is my life we die young cause we livin fast
So I'm a let you read my diary I'ma let you read my dairy

Now lets ride (to where), to Harlem, the Westside
I show you blocks and murals, dawg where some of the best died
(Like who, like who?) Like Porter and them
I heard Po put the order on him, now that's more than a friend!
But he stitched of course, now let's talk about Fritz the boss
And he got rich off snort, they said 500 bricks was brought
So in hindsight, it's a shorty who couldn't get a gist of his thought
But if you grind right wit the snorpy, a whip could be bought
Now think about po-9, if it caught me, how it get you in court
But now the feds, they still tailin' me, DA think he nailin' me
I had to turn in the goons come and post the bail for me
Still in the Byrd Gang myself, you say Byrd Gang is wealth
And all the liquor stores, man the Syzzurp on the shelf
I rose from the dump you see, now it's Dipset, Byrd Gang the company

",Ride Wit' Me
Jim Jones,"They say rap music is subliminal
But the music for us is like our own diary
Something like a confession
They tell me life is a bitch

She's something like the seasons
Just like mother nature
She come and go as she please
That's why they get their period once a month

I say that to say this, if you think that bitch
Summer is yours, she could be cheating on you
Ya heard?

Uh, just got me feeling like opium
I'm tryna dance with the loaded M
Open up a bottle and it goes around
I'm leaving drunk by 4 a.m.

And watch me jump in the golden Benz
Top down with the pokey rims
Now I'm swerving, so you know I'm bent
I lost count, who knows what I spent

I recall nine cleavage
Bitches stepping on my nice sneakers
One hand in the sky, the other hand was on her thigh
I was grinding to the beat with my hammer on my side

Now G's only as we speed to the Rolex
And three or four G's is what we sneeze at the Rolex
Play some out your part, it's about 6 a.m.
You think the night is over but it just began

They say clubs pacing like Bad Boys 2
You can see the snow bunnies do what bad girls do
And that's ecstasy, weed that had girl too
Scoop the bitch that had key's to some fast old blue

Now, I'm speeding to the telly, I got the Porsche behind
Trying to get in her belly the only thought on my mind
Like damn, I'm not trying to be pushy or nothing but
Since the strip joint girl, I should have been fucking

I shoulda lil' mama, listen
Spending my summers with the top dropped low
Throwing my hundreds at the top notch hoes
When we smoking on the top notch dro
Dro, dro, that's the summer wit Miami

Bottle in the air, I'm living without a care
Shorty beside me, wind blowing through her hair
Oh, no, no, that's the summer wit Miami

I can't keep it low anymore
I'll be with my girl, when it starts to snow, I get bored
And when you love three women
It's hard keeping up with lies

See, spring's my first love, I started creeping with July
Used to say I had some shows
Catching planes to M I
Then I started tricking dough, I brought the range for July

Mama said, I'm love sick over this hot ass hoochie
I seen her when I told Nas I slapped her with coffy
We don't play disrespect but that was the day that we met
Summer jam O 2, I hit the stage with my set

But her man, he was from Brooklyn
She still slipped me the number
She said, he's on vacation, so, get with me this summer
Then I been flirting wit her for about the past two years

So now, she hates seeing me in the winter
Ain't gonna last through the year
So now, I'm looking at winter like life's an adventure
And when June come, I'll be gone till September

Now, would you hate me for that?
I know your heart's cold, could you wait till I'm back?
I'm just a sucker for love
But a nigga hold you down if you wanna fuck with a thug

Spending my summers with the top dropped low
Throwing my hundreds at the top notch hoes
When we smoking on the top notch dro
Dro, dro, that's the summer wit Miami

Bottle in the air, I'm living without a care
Shorty beside me, wind blowing through her hair
Oh, no, no, that's the summer wit Miami

Spending my summers with the top dropped low
Throwing my hundreds at the top notch hoes
When we smoking on the top notch dro
Dro, dro, that's the summer wit Miami

Bottle in the air, I'm living without a care
Shorty beside me, wind blowing through her hair",Summer Wit' Miami

What you been drankin on? What you been sippin' on?
What got you bumpin' in the funk wit all that gator on?

'Cause you ain't drunk, hoe, you ain't drunk, hoe
You ain't ridin?, you ain't live, you ain't drunk, hoe

I was up in the club vibin', sippin' on sizzurp vibin'
Gettin' a lil' close with my man, slow grindin? to the jams
These girls gon? start whylin'
They gots to start trippin', they got the crowd listenin'
You know the type, wanna get into a fight when I get a little light
Them chicks just need attention

They playin' different ground, I'm sayin? get from round me
If you spill that drink on my brand new mink
I'ma split every bitch that's round me
We can buck if you want to
I'm the type that'll give you what you want, boo
Y'all chicks can't stand me
I bet a bunch of G?s who's just waitin? to bust things to the roof

You ain't drunk, nigga, you ain't drunk, nigga
Til' that sizzurp and Henny is in your cup, nigga
What you been sippin? on? What you been hittin' on?
It be them chicks in bikinis we bought ?em Cris's on

Call me Diddy, let's ride that out, stop that talk outside your mouth
I'll put guys outside your house, we the hottest in the South
Bad Boy, Dipset, baby girl, get ya lips wet
Maybach like that chauffeur, money ain't too far from Oprah's

You should've seen what I paid my chauffeur
It's enough to buy you a roster
This toaster supposed to take you on a roller coaster
You ain't poppin' like Diddy, baby, I'm rockin' with Diddy, baby
The Drops is terrific, kid, them wrists? to 80

What you been sippin? on? Who you been smokin' with?
What got you actin' all silly doin' stupid shit?
'Cause you ain't drunk, nigga, you little fuck, nigga
You ain't bad, you's a fag, you ain't tough, nigga
What you been drinkin' on?

y'all know the deal
Long John shirt don't show the steal
Ski mask when we gone to kill
We blast and you know we will

We don't mash in this olds-mobiles
Ride to ya block slow as hell
Look for you fucks, unload the shells
A nigga get caught, then please post bail

Eastside to the homies in jail
Know how it be that lonely S.L.
Full of turf is Smokey?s cell
You cookin' it up, then goin' to hell

I'm with a bitch in the front seat holdin' the steal
God, I'm so for real
Move the candy ring to get the candy paint
For them pretty Range Rover wheels

What you been sippin' on? What's in that white cup?
It's that Memphis-in', codeine, not purple tub
?Cause you ain't leanin', bitch, you ain't codeine-in' bitch
That cup and money, you ain't high, you ain't sleepy, bitch
I see what you been drinkin? on

Cock the 4, hold the deuce
Mixed with sprite maybe juice
Prepare to lean off that codeine
Prescription call it syrup, gets me loose

White cup that's full of that oil
Texas T, we call it drank
Sittin' sideways on them 4's
Lavish drippin' wet candy paint

Who's the man, who's the G?

Ya know like that shit sound like rock music
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Yea, my man Bruno just stepped in

You know how we living it up
We all gettin' money
That's what he like to say
Fuck it, it's my life nigga

This is a dream of a hustler
I had the butter and the fiends was in love with us
We copped the gutta, not a team that could fuck with us
And word to mother keep the thing in every truck with us

Now I was fronting like Rich was and some of my bitches
Was going so hard, got some of us sick thugs
And minor setbacks got some of us tripped up
But the guns we done gripped up so we coming to get ya

And fuck the local authorities
And hope the big boys don't pick up my case
'Cause for these big toys and these chips, we get chased
Playing ball just like the Orioles to get to 1st base

But the goons on 2nd, bust on 3rd
You know they move with the weapons, get bucks off birds
It's like I'm playing Chicken with my life
Tryna get this paper moving pitches for a price

I come to ride out with them niggas, baby, we getting figures
It's byrd gang, we doing it big
But we towered up, get the Remy I'll need a cup
You slippin' good, can I get a squeeze?

I don't think you want it with them niggas
'Cause them hammers they won't hesitate to squeeze
We on the road, travel 'cross the globe
All my homies ain't diggin' cheese

Look the nightmares of a trap star
With white tees, Nike air's and my fast car
D.A tryna wrap me in the charge
But I just bought some V's and a pack in my garage

Now me rapping what's the odds?
We the last crew standing diplomats now in charge
Yeah, 300 for the light show
Another hundred on the hand to watch the ice glow

Another 10 grand to watch the dice roll
Trying to let you motherfuckers see this how my life go
The bright lights and this big city
I'ma live the nightlife until the pigs get me

Range Roving, Big Truck Series
The chain frozen, big chunk jewelry
White girls say he's all semi cool
But you don't want to cost him 'cause he got a short fuse

I come to ride out with them niggas, baby, we getting figures
It's byrd gang, we doing it big
But we towered up, get the Remy I'll need a cup
You slippin' good, can I get a squeeze?

I don't think you want it with them niggas
'Cause them hammers they won't hesitate to squeeze
We on the road, travel 'cross the globe
All my homies and they get cheese

We live life on reality and we flip white for a salary
You might catch us at the light in the lavish V
But watch them 'Blue And Whites', try and grab a G

Making some chips so the hate's getting thick
Watch the world through my tint, smoking haze in the whip
Contemplate, maybe take a little trip
Ocean Drive heavy glean in my neck chillin'

Call up cabs, rushing drinks out of 'Wet Willies'
""Eu Seuy O Balling"", but y'all foolish
Getting locked up for crimes and ya lawyer's ain't Jewish
That's why I keep the Turnie's on the tainer

'Cause every time I turn I'm getting chained up
They say what they want to search, tryna tame us
I think they mad we from the turf and we dangerous
And my whole crew icey we playing hockey like the rangers

I come to ride out with them niggas, baby, we getting figures
It's byrd gang, we doing it big
But we towered up, get the Remy I'll need a cup
You slippin' good, can I get a squeeze?

I don't think you want it with them niggas
'Cause them hammers they won't hesitate to squeeze
We on the road, travel 'cross the globe
All my homies ain't diggin' cheese

I don't think you want it with them niggas

Jim Jones,"Yo, it definitely is a concrete jungle
And yet there's more to life than misery
We have to have unity in our community
We have to work together brothers and sisters

Yeah, this is Dr. Ben, I'm with Jim Jones
(Lord knows, I was on the run confused)
DipSet forever
(Shit)
We're talking about a concrete jungle
(Yeah, it sure is a jungle)
Life or death, you have to choose life
(I done seen it all, at least I think I seen it all)

I'm with my concrete jungle, no Tarzans and Janes
Diesel by the bundles and the hard grams of Caine
D's when they come through, it's hard to get some change
Smoking weed getting drunk, in the car for a flame

Yeah, I see the traffic but we dipping on the shoulder
Winter start to set in, it's only getting colder
And I miss you all my political soldiers
Most are doing life for moving bricks or doing hold-ups

Damn, I know we caught up in the fast life
Some like a fiend when they caught up on the glass pipe
Me, I'm still caught up from last night
Same clothes from the club on the block getting cash right

Damn, you know this world full of misery
Some get tore up 'til they hurl off the liquor be
Somebody told me that the girls need the chivalry
That's why I cop ice 'til they ass get the shivers be

Ain't nothing sweet living in this ghetto
(Ain't nothing sweet about it)

Been there, done that, so I can live out all my dreams
(Live out my dreams)
Now put your lighters to your head, nigga ride

For the coke I would sleep hard
But the game drove me nuts, in the streets, I'm a full-fledged retard
Was the city block overseer
Man your life is Chuck E. Cheese, mine is a pizzeria

How many pies I done flipped? I lost count
How many guys I done gave shit? I lost count
Holding but I can't ignore cheating
Any day your life could be the hot topic at that board meeting

They discussing who'll stretch you for your trees
For your thievery, you living, you breathing for no fucking reason
That's how it is when you make a man
That's why your man's gotta learn to make himself then you shake his hand

Man, I'm into catching heavy clams
And when Dezzy can us when it comes to dumping I got heavy hands
Ain't gonna be right for your picking jet
This is ours, the square is where we eat, this our kitchenette

Ain't nothing sweet living in this ghetto

Been there, done that, so I can live out all my dreams
(Live out my dreams)
Now put your lighters to your head, nigga ride

I let my temper hit the floor
I be staring through the mirror as I serenade my halls
I'm fond of the juices that marinate they drawers
My shorty, she bank a carrot with the four 'cause

If you take us out, the streets will evolve
Some niggaz they live to eat, some niggaz eat to survive
And my conscience keep disturbing me, fucking with my energy
Niggaz that I thought was friends, really the enemy

Dear Lord, please grant me the serenity
To accept the things that I cannot change
Locked up for eight years and ain't join no gangs
Been converted to true nigga, I'm as real as they come

And any moment I have you staring the barrel of my gun
Put my dick up in the streets but I'm married to the slums
Put the chips up in the ante and tally up the sum
I'm having fun, hitting the fiends in the allies with some jums

Ain't nothing sweet living in this ghetto
(Ain't nothing sweet about it)
Been there, done that, running in the streets
(I'm running young, wild and free)
Now put your lighters to your head, nigga ride

Trying to make the most of my hustle
(I'm trying to make the most of my hustle)
Been there, done that, so I can live out all my dreams
(Live out my dreams, live out my dreams)
Now put your lighters to your head, nigga ride

Alright, yeah but in choosing life, you got choices
(Oh yeah)
The jungle is full of everything
It's the mother and the father of creation
(Ain't nothing sweet about it)
But listen up, you have to choose something for yourself
Do something for yourself, make something of yourself

That's what time it is
(Don't let go)
Go strong, be strong, stand for something in life
(All my young soldiers)
Yeah, concrete jungle, I can feel it, I can smell it

Now due to me, me and my truancy
Running through the streets since early puberty
What influenced me? It was the jewelry
Tryna get cash so I can do it like the older G's

The 80's, big thick rope chains
Life was all crazy getting rich off cocaine
So I been caught up dog, nothing like Usher
More like a hustler

All night with customers, tryna get my paper up
Jealousy, envy gotta watch, they'll spray you up
But it was something bout the gun play
Rolling dice on blocks, double parked up on a one way

And breaking law was the norm'
The club break about 4 in the morn'd
So we parking lot pimp, hit the diner for some grub
The squad type thick you know I'm rolling with the thugs

Know ya dress code, heavy sag on ya Dickies

And get screwed, get a deuce and we can blow it up
ATL sharp, if you balling and you make it rain
In love with a stripper, alcohol on ya brain

Fast track life, the shit is uncanny
When it come to birds fly south to Miami
Weather like 80, drop-top Mercedes
""Sai Pa Say"", on the block in Little Haiti

Chicago is the wolves, the bears and the gangster's
2 12'N with the OG's, tryna get the answers
And all these O. T trips got me tired, drive the wheels
'Til they fall off and I just bought some new tires

Byrd gang we get money

So don't forget about me, don't forget about me

Jim Jones,"Now don't push me away 'cause when the first time I met you
Girl, you shook me in ways
You know the life of a nigga's cookin' up yay
And because you knew the pitfalls and the tumbles of the game

You've seen the spotlight watch niggas fallin' to the fame
And all the time you tried to tell me to stay hungry and maintain
When I was like let's go half on a baby
And if not then lets go half on a 'cedes

Drop top coup while we pumpin' sweet sadie
Flyin' up Lennox, doin' us, pushin' 80
The road trips, the late nights got you pissed
The road trips, the late nights got us rich

The clothes that we wear, the place that we piss
Run and get shot, we ain't what we sit
So if I don't get a chance to tell you
Now too often lately girl how your hand so helpful

In this cold world girl every man needs help too
So baby, I'ma ride and no plans to fail you

Please, baby, don't push me away
I want you
Please, baby don't push me away
I need you

I had enough of the shucking and jiving, duckin' and hidin'
I'm tryin' to get to conversation and ridin'
'Cause I'm feelin' your essence your presence
Is just enough to let me know that it's destined

And since the day that I found you, there's something about you
That makes me want to lose it and pounce ya
But it's not just your body, it's your mind
Your spirit, everything combined

And while I got a chance, take my hand
And let me show you something real, that love you can feel

Please, baby, don't push me away
I want you
Please, baby don't push me away
I need you

Uh, now two years done passed, few cheers, few laughs
Coppin' Vs, shoppin' sprees gears in the bags
And who cares who's near 'cause most of the bitches
Would just say you was there for the cash

And I ain't scared of your past, I prepare for the future
The one thing I ask is just don't tear a nigga coup up
You brang the bail when I was caged up
And back and forth the court to the lawyer now we case shut

You found the numbers in my phone, you was my face but
You know what they say the break ups to make ups
And I admit I'm getting better with the flirtin'
You know you dead sexy when you yellin' and you cursin'

You such a hell of a person
So when I get home I'm gonnna tell you in person
Face to face, I'ma run base to base
And then I'ma slide home safe till I make yo body shake

You tell me every night that life comes with a twist
That I'm in the spotlight and I'm runnin' the risk
Hey, you always say love don't come with a kiss
It's hard soakin' up game when it's comin' from a bitch

But where's my manners, never take you for granted?
Never take you advantage, most people don't understand it
Is you happy? Look inside humor
When you and I together what the fuck they gonna do wit us?

Say ya prayer 'cause we destined for glory
And when the credits roll it's Harlem's West Side Story

My vision of the lovin' is close
That's how I want us to be when we doin' our thing
Kissin' ya, lickin' ya, touchin' ya, rubbin' ya
Tell me how you want me to bring it?

Because I know he got limits
But baby I don't, and my feelin's they won't
Let you get away from me, come stay with me
Baby, baby, please, baby, don't push me away

When the sunshine turn to rain
Baby, I can take away your pain
Just call me up when you need some time
I'll take you out, break you off like daddy come on

You don't have to settle for less
And baby, I can give you what you want
Just call me up when you need some time
And you can get it from me just like daddy come on

Next thing you know she'll be tastin' my good

I get money be quiet, you talkin' to the jolly green giant
I see it, I like it, I buy it
Baby I'm flyer then a pilot
Flyin' at his highest, climb it

We make hits in the studio nightly
We out trying to get this money
We take trips in the winter in jet planes
To climates where it's sunny

We got mami on the dance floor
Grindin' to the beat, tipsy off the bubbly
But at the end of the day, we feelin' to play
I'm tryin' to pin the tail on the donkey

Where are my homies? Up to no good
Where are my homies? Yup I'm so hood
What up pimpin', pimpin', I'm exempt already
See my hoes are like my plates, temporary

Act nil you beat it, move on strategic
The marbles man, yup the floors are heated
Cam half pound a quart a kid better ask 'round
I'm sorta needed mack rounds you're deceited

In the 90's, Z3, BB's
Now in the crib the TVs watch TVs
Killen Killen, mo killen and then a kitty purrs
Fuck furs, his and hers, Bentley spurs

Gun talk, real talk, speak mack to mack
We like the Pistons, Bulls, you know back to back
Mazirattis back to back, come ride wit me
On 11 hundred, not the pipe, two five fifties

We make hits in the studio nightly
We out trying to get this money
We take trips in the winter in jet planes
To climates where it's sunny

Uh, yeah, you know
This that dope boy shit, nigga
Ya smell me, fuck wit ya

Your reign on the top, short like leprechauns
I came through in drops, Porches and heavy charms
And I came from the block, was flawless with ex-cons
And we aimin' them glocks, of course, ready to bomb

Now I done seen a custy cop four pies of the same gear
I also seen a nigga cop four rides in the same year
The concrete jungle, no trees to swing from
This weed and gettin' drunk and heaters gettin' dumped

Or hit the highway, nigga, key's up in the trunk
Back up in the city with some skeezers in the trunk
I ain't a player but I do my dirt, dawg
Drop top 'Cedes better move when it murk off

I got it swayin' to the left lane
Plus a nigga coughin' 'cause the haze give me chest pain
Yes, mothafucka, the boys are back with my vest
And I'm tucked up with my boys in back, fucka

You don't want it with them niggas
While you haters steady bitchin', my niggas gettin' richer
Bet you're mad 'cause we ballin', bet you're mad 'cause we scorin'
If he get outta line, put his punk ass in the coffin

Nigga, we the regime, Byrdgang, we the truth
Even four in sedan, I'm swervin' in the coupe
Oak wood in interior, suede on the roof
Now shoot back, now shoot back

Ah man, Hell Rell, he on the same bullshit again
Same black hoodie, ya same fo' fifth again
Bitches stop likin' me but now they on my dick again
See me in that Aston with my chain glistenin'

Yeah, I'm bustin' off the chrome, yeah, I'm 'bout to off your dome
Kill a mother and a father, kids go to foster homes
Yeah, I like to floss the chrome, nigga, leave the boss alone
See my neck and my wrist, I'm rockin' with a cost for homes

Homie, they don't call me Ruger for nothin'
Back out on these bitch niggas, get that Ruger to dumpin'
So don't run up on me, nigga, you know I stay with it
G'd up from my beef and brocks, to the Oakland A's, fitted

That's the bottom to the top, you seen the bottom of the pot
I got it white, I got it tan, it's either you coppin' or you not
Nigga, jets is pullin' off and you stuck on the curb
D I P, be G, fuck what you heard

You don't want it with them niggas

Nigga, we the regime, Byrdgang, we the truth
Even four in sedan, I'm swervin' in the coupe
Oak wood in interior, suede on the roof
Now shoot back, now shoot back

We all strapped in the ride, I ain't talkin' like the elderly
Yak when we drive, like we rollin' fuckin' felony
Trap to survive, get the buck, sellin' keys, it's hard to get by
That's why we puff hella weed

But if this high don't come down
I feel the walls spinnin' like the sky gon' come down
I need air, top of the ride, gon' come down
And I swear I stay fly when I jump out

Jewled up in ice, that bent that dude like
Spyder 430 with the bluish lights
Got the coupe, bright, but we still shoot dice
For my niggas on the Eastside, this is true life

You don't want it with them niggas
While you haters steady bitchin', my niggas gettin' richer
Bet you're mad 'cause we ballin', bet you're mad 'cause we scorin'

I'm in the coupe relaxing, you see the roof collapsing
I got my paper up although I'm still kufi smacking
And it's God fearing, foreign car steering
60 thou Jabar wearing, just beat a trial hearing

You should catch me walking cocky out the courtroom
Like eat my dust, a buck 40 for the Porsche zoom
We back in population, we cop drops to race 'em
We getting money over here what's your occupation

We on top of things and we got them things
But we only sell them birds, you tryna cop a wing?
I know the real rich, the real Richard Porter
RIP he left the hood to us, we own the corners

The bright lights and my big city
My ice bright and the wrist silly
I'm risking Fed time, front page headline
Make the pedal hit the floor 'til the throttle red line

I let my pants sag, so I can show my ass
It's twenty g's a pocket, that's 'cause we blowing cash
And when the photo's flash, Gallardies going pass
Lights, camera's, autographs 'Wet Willies"", call a cab

The fast life is pricey, the time piece is icey
And my niggaz moving fish scale just like the Pisces
Momma raised a thug, lawyers when we face the judge
This is the chance we take to try and put ya brain on drugs

And we invade the clubs standing on the furniture
Throwing gang signs, two stepping with our burners tucked
And we will burn you up like three star alarm
We are the bomb hundred g's on the charm

You'd think I own the cleaners how I wash that paper
And now we at the dealer tryna cop all flavors
We at the dealer dog, so how you feeling y'all?
Just tear the ceiling off, fuck the light we peeling off

House money on the necklace the pigs want him arrested
'Cause I'm obsessed with the guns and the vest's
'Cause when you get some cake, the candles come with a death wish

The rock star living, the hot cars and women
The God forgive him, hope the cop cars don't get 'em
Them bitches on the bozart at the club, throwing stacks
At Star Wars, they threw two I threw four back

And I'm back, it's Mr. New York City
My hat to the back, I stay flyer than a Frisbee
We still Diddy bopping, we still could get it poppin'
Ain't nothing change but the year of the Range

And the clouds still moving with the squamy
And the gangsta's don't die, we get money and move to Miami!

All types of incidentals charges on my room
From last night buggin', we mobbin' with the goons

We hit the town hard, fuckin' with the ladies
Bottles of viva clique, puffin' on the hazy
It's all deja vu seen it all before
Got her in my drop heater on the floor

So I sped off from the spot, gettin' heady rock
Got her in the telly she wouldn't let a nigga pop

Gotta get fly squad ready to ball
We thinkin' 112 or maybe even visions
Drinks at the bar like baby what you sippin'

Then she told me magic city fat asses and they pretty
They got me blowin' thousands throwin' stacks by the fifty
Got some bitches out of strokers gotta get focus
I'm tryin' to play my cards like a game of strip poker

Flight up in the mornin' gotta get up on her
When I leave you can tell ya friends about my performance
And all the time M.O.B. on my mind
The weekend was nice baby but I'm back to N.Y.

See the fly cars that the big wheelies pushed out,
Dirt bikes popping wheelies by the cookout, that was that summer,
I was thirst to be plumper. It pays better but the risk was worst,
Save the fly leather copping kicks with the work.
It didnt work; I was fucken up the re-up.
Bottles at the tunnel, that was 98, I called papa for the bundles,
An easy ten grand, it felt like a hundred,
These Gucci belts by the stomach, with guns in them.
Its only wealth that we want, if we run wit em
Till the death, until the feds come and get em
Byrd gang money, it started off that Byrd Kane Money
New cars, in that third lane money!

Just clean my fancy car,
Picked up my fancy clothes,
And we only in the hot spot,
No, we got the bomb,
We got the bomb,
This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money
Only real niggas spending that Byrd gang money.

Getting money is the hardest,
Your first hundred grand is a job
Your first cool million, you're an artist.
Especially if the niggas up the block, sell garbage
Told it, crumbles all apart when you hold it
Wasn't naturally born a crook, I was molded
Drugs kept my uncles in the green, so I sold it
Even learned to smell a good grade through the packing
Headed Midwest and got financial backing
Started networking with the wheelies on credit
Any concepts of being robbed I was debited
Anybody get it, don't come a day later with the eigth money
Got to play it out, cause I said it
Courts an acquittal, coming in the club with an entourage
Me I'm the boss in the middle.
The brain and the bran roc-a-house rope around the neck
A lot of letters for the chain, and the charm. Come on man

Just clean my fancy car
Picked up my fancy clothes
And we only in the hot spot,
No, we got the bomb,
We got the bomb
This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money
Only niggas spending that Byrd gang money.

At a young age, no bricks just grams
Nigga stuck, then your mans a flip
The situation real, then your mans a hit
You slow on the get-a-way, the can you get
You circle the block, you play track and field
A lot of real niggas on that track got killed
But you know me forever manning up,
Never sit down when I pee, forever standing up
I'm a boss, so I'm calling the shots,
Big homie, pioneer of the block
You wanna pump, nigga Ill tell you when and where at
Don't face-fight; I'm not the one to stare at.
Matter of fact dog, you and your man sits,
In the back off cop car, dog, pointing your index
I guess you could, cause you a Sammy the Bull
But somebody gonna die if a hammer get pulled.

Just clean my fancy car
Picked up my fancy clothes
And we only in the hot spot,
No, we got the bomb,
We got the bomb
This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money
Only niggas spending that Byrd gang money.

Just clean my fancy car
Picked up my fancy clothes
And we only in the hot spot,
No, we got the bomb,
We got the bomb
This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money

Jim Jones,"You know, everybody expect a baller, but I'm like
Why you worried about balling, cause I am balling
I'm just ready to blow the bank on you girl
You know we just splashing them this year
It's all about that splash life
I still live the fast life, I blow the bank though

I got at place in mind, for my move to LA
Or my mansion in NJ, we can party in the sky

Where you wanna go?

From Manhattan to my hood, where my money's never good
We can spend it playa, tell me what you want

Trying to scoop something nice (fly girl)
Trying to put you on the flight
I'm a jumper, we can do Aruba tonight
Or we can jump in the coupe and just shoot for the night
She was dancing in the club with her pumps in her hand
Trying to tell her that The Trump was the plan
Trying to get her out of the club
And have her jump in the Lamb (Murcielago)
Konichiwa, we can jump to Japan (you like sushi?)
Or we can just do the tropics
We need more problems cause the money ain't the object
Probably get mad cause the smokes in the cockpit (so what?)
Chest cold as a froze up locket

I wanna blow the bank with you
Spending all that money, spending all that cash
I wanna blow the bank with you
Spending all that money, spending all that cash, let's go

In Atlanta, popped up like a toaster (I'm burnt out)
Did Miami in the soft-top roadster (drop top)
Rose champs, spilling drinks on the sofa (champagne don't stain)
Thank god for the chauffeur
Where to little lady?
She's my designated driver
Bad little be, like the destiny survivor (she's a dime)
We can see the sun rise up
Speeding to the room in the V getting highed up (hit that, hit that)
Or we can jump through the block
Brand new whip, so you can jump through the top
Hop out like who got bank
Then we blow it all cause you know we gonna ball

I wanna blow the bank with you
Spending all that money, spending all that cash
I wanna blow the bank with you

Jim Jones,"This shit is fucked up cause
Some niggas call it tough love
It's crazy cause
You might know a nigga all your life
And he got a twisted alterier motive
And he just wanna see you do bad
See a smile on your face all day
So he just acting like your friend
When he is really your enemy
Or your best friend can become your enemy
Through the the jealousy
So we call those frienemies

Knew him since a child
Played cops and robbers
My best partner grew up to be monsters
Stayed in my crib
Ate out my fridge
We was on a grind
Even wore the same clothes
My brother
Fucked the same hoes
His beef was mine
Even had the same foe
We was inseparable
Joined at the hip
I let you get the checks
I kept the joints on the hit
And what happened
The sneaky hating
Niggas in your ear
And a plan deviating
Snakes in the grass
Just waiting for the moment
Niggas on your team
And they're really your opponent
Play the game
And you know goes booments
Mama said friends come by the dozen
Know I'm feeling for their guns
When I hug em'
I hate them from a close
From a distance I could love em'

[Chorus]
Frienemies [Repeat: x2]
The ones you kept close
The ones you love most
Frienemies
You know who you kiss
You know who you lift
This shit is getting scary
Frenemies [Repeat: x2]
The ones you kept secret
You had plans to make it
Frienemies
I smell danger
Over the money
Best friends become strangers

Bailed you out of jail
Wait let me backtrack
First you came home
Then I got your ass a deal
Fresh out the can
Signed a quater mill
Running through the paper
Buying copes and popping pills
Money got low
You started acting ill
You grew desperation
Once again you got nailed
Someone got killed
Conspiracy, and even still
I bailed you out of jail
Without me you would be facing
In a pale, barude nuders
You would be Judice
But in the process
Flew you in the world
Put diamonds on your neck
Like you were my little girl
Put money in your pocket
Like you was my son Su
Food in your stomach
Like you was my son Pooh
The streets talk
Heard you partnered Tru
Now you talking shit
Like you really wanna do it
A will-wack
The type that deceive you
Your mama should have told you
Never bite the hand that feed you
Caught me off guard
I met you through my man
I let my guards down
And accepted you as fam
Told you get a chair
Let you eat at the table
Never thought that he would be ungrateful
But guess what
I own the pub and the label
So if a nigga feeling itchy
I got killers on the paper

[Chorus]

Hope y'all paying attention
Keep y'all eyes open
Hope I ain't wasting my breathe
About this shit that I'm talking about
Cause it's so real
You gotta watch these niggas around you
Cause you never know whose who now a days
And all of our love we be showing
They might not be showing the same type of love back
Matter of fact
They might not be in there for your best interest
See an alterier motive is hard to see when
You've known a person for so long, or
You've became a custom to their ways
But you gotta stay on 50
You gotta stay on 50
Cause, you got some people that
Think like, if niggas is moving fast like that
Then karma will get em'
But sometimes karma don't come around fast enough
To handle the situation
But sometimes for us to learn a lesson
We go way to far
Then the consequences become way too heavy
That's what I'm trying to let learn from experience
And please don't be naive to the fact that
The nigga next to you could be the nigga that set you up for failure
Or even kill you
You know how the game go
And you gotta watch these bitches
These trifling bitches man they set you up for failure too
You know they're in there for the money man
Gold digging bitches
It's a fucked up world
But you probably won't even get a chance
You know, might put you up in a gang

Jim Jones,"N they shootin, I must be on top 
(it's clear up here) 
We coopin we must be inta trouble, 
Some hard type shit that cost a quarter mill a pop 
It makes me laugh ha, life is so ironic, 
How I would get tha cash I become so iconable 
Cop the fast cars that come with the trip tonic panel 
I live the life that's filled with the jealousy 
Doomed from the start its like we born wit a felony 
Where's the longevity 
We in the place where best friends become enemies 
And foul nigguhs got the tendency 
You gotta watch what you wish for 
I hope to god its on a switchboard 
When I'm tryin to say a prayer and I'm callin' hope you listen lord 
See its just my position lord 
Gotta me smokin on this blunt while I'm lookin' at the sky 
Make it rain so I know the doves cry. 

[Chorus]
Lord do you hear me praying, when I'm lookin' at the sky 
I hope you can hear what I'm saying 
Its like my, my, my 
I'm not really complaining, but it makes me wanna cry 
I know you can see what I'm saying 
Its like my, my, my 
Its like my, my, my 

Cause God ain't cryin' when the sky starts to rain 
That must you and god in heaven poppin' champagne 
And speakin' of the shams, remember in Miami 
You got bent pussy it was your first trip wit me 
We was goin' hard to many bottles up in free-vay 
You was goin' crazy wit my Haitian man t-sway 
Pass that on the twins I had teesh fer like three days 
And I can't forget you're be-day 
We had dead body tap we was deeper then aye 
And now I'm just wishin' I could see a nigguh face 
And they kill, bang bang, did you get it wit em yet 
And its a damn shame because nigguhs still upset 
Like chita chala god musta needed y'all 
I think about the street dream saw how we were born 
But now all I got is the memories of two great soldiers 
That are dear friends of me

To tell you both the truth, I ain't doin' the best 
I'm tryin' to keep a positive mind movin' through the stress 
I'm tryin' to stay afloat, they say I'm doin' the most 
I'm doin' way to much I'm playin' death to close 
I'm think bout the thought of goin' back to court 
For the petty little games I really should avoid 
But its the calculator risk on how we make the chip 
Realizin' if I slip its a bottomless pit 
If you'd a filled my shoes, would you walk a mile 
Let the media tear you down and turn around and smile 
I thank god that I'm alive to see a black president 
We screamin' yes we can but that won't change the deficit 
That ain't really even the best of it, 
You catch me in the streets I will surly tell you the rest of it

They said damn man you looking like Pac
I said nah, not alive, man I'm looking like Jones (cappo)
Besides I put money on your skull and bones
And keep it low watch what you say up on those fucking phones
Be quiet

And get ya ass hung the fuck up just like a bunch of clothes
Hey ma, we stretch work like you touch your toes
And in the middle of July we got that summer snow
I got em snowboarding in August
And I love a pretty bitch but the Porsche look gorgeous (you see it)
Harlem is one big ski slalom
I guess the Hill is like the Swiss Alps, we bring them whips out

Waiting at the flash throwing money at the cameras

Looking at my ass know you wish he had a camera

And now the money taste sweet like pastry, they hate me (back at you)
Now tell me how I look
Would you rather live life like me or by the book? (you get it?)

Make the wrong move will put your faggot ass in the ER

The feds taking flicks of us (say cheese)
They all know I put on for Harlem
Tell rich Broadway I took it up another level (God bless 'em)
I took 80, blew it on a Beezle
Bought the new Fiskar flew it through the ghetto (15th st)
The definition of opulence
The jewels dripping we dropping on top and popping shit (splash)
Who would think that this kid from the projects
Get his neck so cold you would think he's lethargic (I'm froze up)
The wrist look like hypothermia set in (what)
Pick a club night that the burner don't get in (I can't recall that)
We pop champagne until the club let out (and)
I drink and I fuck and then I piss a nigga rent out

Teachers so you study your lessons
And advise for that viewer discretion
On a scale to one to ten I get eleven
Give a toast to the pussy like Devin
And beat it up off Sprite and Seagram Seven
I've plottin' on a way to get rich
And keep bread out that cock
And all the folks in the hood aimin' for head
Shots of lead poppin'
Situation's crucial

Though there seems there's no one to this pain 
Every time I close my eyes I pray for rain 
I pray for rain to wash away the strain 

You couldn't understand how much the pain weight 
So in the hood we love the rainy days 
Cause subconsciously we know the suns coming 
We love the winter cause we know the summers coming 
Remember I got locked the same night my son was coming 
All I could do is pray that they don't take me away 
And lord knows I have the angel's on my side 
They search the car I had the hammer in my ride 
A miracle on Flatbush Avenue I still made it back 
To say push when she was having you 
A newer version a younger me I want him to go to school 
And raise him motherfucka free I swear some places I don't want him to be 
I swear some things I don't want him to see but new booty daddy
Loves you truly and the nights you don't see me you know daddy's on his duty 

[Chorus]

What's a poor mans pickle survive threw the poor pull a truck upfront 
And drive threw the store had to be a felon hated being proper 
Read the book of life and Satan was the author still I was the cooperative 
Rather be in Rykers the bugger had my baby momma running threw them 
Diapers all fo that shiting and all them pampers 
Grandma laid up with all of that cancer lid paint flaking constantly chipping 
Mama with that dark rum constantly sipping I vow to my name a bad transmission for getting in the game that's a bad transition 
One flick one night I'm ally ally out sin free for getting you a place with a g 
A couple heavy shots ima newer man ready go and get paper the hustler 
With the confetti 

[Chorus]

I can truly understand how life can drain all the passion from a man 
With just one chance it can change his circumstance 
And get the money baby lets get the money baby

Jim Jones,"See this is the life that most people dreamed of but this what we live for
They wanna take this from us why
Cause we young black rich and famous, I wouldn't trade it for the world
And there's no regrets in life, how that sound

This is the life
When the champagne spills and the Rollie on a nigga wrist glows
This is the life
When the spotlight shines and the camera gets me with a sick pose

This is the life
When the night time falls and the cash shuts everything down
This is the life
I'm escapin' on a heartache so why you gotta blame the hood?

Main dragon chin chillied up
Took the champagne glasses, please fill 'em up
Don't be scared that you spillin' it
And tell the truth is you feelin' it

That's the breeze from the gutta
We make cheese cop V'S and burn rubba
The latest coop V's got the ladies loopy
Indulged in the world so we spend the paper loosely

Life in the lime light, pretty, pretty bitches
My ice shine bright, break bread wit my niggaz
The feds takin' pictures, we call 'em paparazzi
I tell my possie vogue strike a pose
I hop up in the Rolls, blunt, I'm gonna smoke

Prayin' to God is there Harlem up in heaven?
Gazin' at the stars Ferrari engine rarrin'
At the red light and Harlem was the settin'

I'm married to a gang but didn't come for the weddin'
It started with the dealin' and dreams of four wheelin'
Comin' up I ran a amuck in the streets
Chasin' the fast bucks, stomach touch gotta eat

Now we orderin' breakfast, I'm sittin' at the table
Stackin' up my pancakes the syrups on maple
I gotta watch my brothers 'cause Cain can turn Abel
Gotta watch the money 'cause the thing can turn tables

This is the life
I'm escapin' on a heartache so why you gotta blame the hood?

All I need in this world of sin is just me and the pearl twin turbo
Blowin' smoke through the pipes, gettin' ghost through the night
This is fast life livin', pick a coast if you like

The day we cell dope, the night is velvet rope
Party with the chicks from the club with hella smoke
Whips that we valet soon as we hit Cali
Call the more buckets, ask the waitress what's the tally

Swipin' all da cash, lightin' up the grass
Four Seasons stays, more reason for us to play
Doin' sunset the Porsche Caberlay
Or the red eye flights like the Jedi Knight in Star Wars

In the face, I'mma wash it like black sand (check the watch box)
And I used to sell smack like a back hand (X-15 Sharif)
And I see through you niggas like a cat scan (get em')
And fuckers getting fax like a lap dance (fuck that)
They say I’m a rock star it's like the Gap Band (aye now)
It’s new whips, I pull into the night club
I got them Jordan number 6 outta flight club
Sway still in seats all piped up,
And we ain't leave the club until the lights out (one more bottle)
Everyday I stay splashy like it’s Easter (Word)
That’s why they say I’m something like a fashionista
Roll some, burn some, pass the reefer
I turn the shit black and yellow, tape Like Khalifa (black and yellow)
I’m so fly, tell me where I’m landing
I hope the summer hot nigga, where we tanning

And I don't know what to say to him, I mean,
Do you think he blondes?
I guess I could be blonder

Over the shadows and the rain

Jim Lammers,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep

Well I forded the river

I paid all my bills

Gave a gift to the giver

Now I'm headed for the hills


I paid back my borrows

Likewise all my dues

I'll be gone tomorrow

Nothing here I can use


Headed for the hills

Headed for the hills

I can't hear 'em calling

Headed for the hills


Once I had a a woman

Deaf and mute and blind

Only one could hear me

When I tried to speak my mind


Once I had a fiddle

Once I had a bow

There's nothing on the griddle

But I paid back all I owed


Headed for the hills

Headed for the hills

I can't hear 'em calling

Headed for the hills


Can't roll off to glory

Much less Arkansas

Or freedom teritory

Till you satisfy the law


No love, lock and chain

Provides me the key

No blood-soaked law of Cain

Can set my spirit free


Headed for the hills

Headed for the hills

I can't hear 'em calling

Headed for the hills


Last thing I got to do

One thing before I go

To say my love for you

Was all the love I know


If you don't forget me

I'll do the same for you

Forever in your memory

To pay back all that's due


Headed for the hills

Headed for the hills

I can't hear 'em calling

I went out walking up high timberline

Snow fell like kisses, the air sweet as wine

Calling me back to the days you were mine

So close to heaven, up high timberline

So close to heaven up high timberline

Way up on high timberline


Remember my love, do this for me

For I think of you all the time

Whenever the wind howls lonesome and free

From the peaks of the high timberline


Like a vision of angels the higher I climb

A mare and a stallion with traces so fine

Stepping like dancers in three-quarter time

The ghost of white horses of high timberline

The ghost of white horses of high timberline

Way up on high timberline


Remember my love, do this for me

For I think of you all the time

Whenever the wind howls lonesome and free

From the peaks of the high timberline


I love you and I always will

Although we for evermore part

Sierra Nevada remembers us still

Holds our love deep in her heart


For shame that the sun showed its face on the day

You and the rose on your cheeks slipped away

But the promises love made between us still shine

When we rode white horses up high timberline

Dancing white horses up high timberline

Way up on high timberline

Looking elsewhere, looking around

I sat me down, I sat me down

Looking for answers where they can't be found

I come around, I come around


Elsewhere, that's where I was looking

When I should have been looking right over there

Over and over, never too far

That's where I'll be looking, wherever you are


Looking for good love, for love sweet and true

Looking for you, I was looking for you

I knew when I saw you, that my looking was through

Brought you my heart, and I hope it will do


Elsewhere, that's where I was looking

When I should have been looking right over there

Over and over, never too far

That's where I'll be looking, wherever you are


Looking elsewhere from the sky to the ground

From the sea to the sunset, from the hill to the town

From the creek to the bar room, from the dawn till the sun

Sinks over the mountain and another day is done


Elsewhere, that's where I was looking

When I should have been looking right over there

Over and over, right over there

Sweet apple blossoms twined in your hair


Looking elsewhere

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me

When on the world the mists began to fall
Out of the dreams that rose in happy throng
Low to our hearts love sung an old sweet song .
And in the dusk where fell the firelight gleam
Softly it wove itself into our dream

Just a song at twilight, when the lights are low
And theflick'ring shadows softly come and go
Though the heart be weary sad the day and long ,
Still to us at twilight comes love's old song
Comes love's own sweet song 
Even today we hear love's song of yore .
Deep in our hearts it dwells for evermore
Footsteps may falter, weary grow the way
Still we can hear it at the close of day
So till the end, when life's dim shadows fall
Love will be found the sweetest song of all

And each kiss an inspiration

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.

Now it seems years
I'm back in the city
Where nothing is clear
But thoughts of me holding you,
Bringing us near

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

Time in New England
Took me away
To long rocky beaches
And you by the bay
We started a story
Whose end must now wait

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

I feel the change comin'
I feel the wind blow
I feel brave and daring
I feel my blood flow
With you I could bring out
All the love that I have
With you there's a heaven,
So earth ain't so bad

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you

Jim Nabors,"The streets are always wet with rain
After a summer shower when I saw you standin'
In the garden in the garden wet with rain
You wiped the teardrops from your eye in sorrow
As we watched the petals fall down to the ground
And as I sat beside you I felt the
Great sadness that day in the garden

And then one day you came back home
You were a creature all in rapture
You had the key to your soul
And you did open that day you came back to the garden

The olden summer breeze was blowin' on your face
The light of God was shinin' on your countenance divine
And you were a violet colour as you
Sat beside your father and your mother in the garden

The summer breeze was blowin' on your face
Within your violet you treasure your summery words
And as the shiver from my neck down to my spine
Ignited me in daylight and nature in the garden

And you went into a trance
Your childlike vision became so fine
And we heard the bells inside the church
We loved so much
And felt the presence of the youth of
Eternal summers in the garden

And as it touched your cheeks so lightly
Born again you were and blushed and we touched each other lightly
And we felt the presence of the Christ

And I turned to you and I said
No Guru, no method, no teacher
Just you and I and nature
And the father in the garden

No Guru, no method, no teacher
Just you and I and nature
And the Father and the
Son and the Holy Ghost
In the garden wet with rain
No Guru, no method, no teacher
Just you and I and nature and the holy ghost
In the garden, in the garden, wet with rain
No Guru, no method, no teacher
Just you and I and nature

If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promise myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top will throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to who
Ever what it's like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch at a church
Where people saying: ""My god, that's tough
She's stood him up""
No point in us remaining
We may as well go home
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to well wouldn't do
The role i was about to play
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much, as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me in doubt
Talk about God and His mercy
Or if He really does exist
Why did He desert me in my hour of need
I truly am indeed Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do? What do we do?

Alone again, naturally
Now looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears

And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul,
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally

With whom I shared A four sordid rooms in Chelsea
She wasn't what you'd call a blushing flower
As a matter of fact she rented by the hour.

The day she died the neighbors came to snicker:
Well, that's what comes from too much pills and liquor.
But when I saw her laid out like a Queen,
She was the happiest, corpse, I'd ever seen.

I remember how she'd turn to me and say:

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay:
In fields where they lay a-keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

They looked up and saw a star,
Shining in the east, beyond them far:
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from the country far;
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

This star drew nigh to the north-west;
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

Then entered in those wise men three,
Fell reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in his presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the kind of Israel.

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,
That hath made heaven and earth of nought,
And with his blood mankind has bought.

Over the hills and everywhere

Over silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light.

The shepherds feared and trembled,
When lo! above the earth,
Rang out the angels chorus
That hailed the Savior's birth.

And lo! When they had heard it,
They all bowed down to pray,
Then traveled on together,
To where the Baby lay.

Down in a lowly manger

And maybe we could grab a bite to eat 
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me

I've looked at clouds from both sides now,
from up and down, and still somehow,

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels, the dizzy dancing way you feel
as every fairy tale comes real; I've looked at love that way.

I just wished that I could lose it

I always hope there'll be nice weather
between us, there's nothing worse
than when you turn into a thunderstorm with me

and how do i help you?
and how do you help me?
we'll buy an umbrella
and we might be safe from the turbulent weather

Jim O'Rourke,"Hello, Hello, can you hear me?
Are your skies clear and sunny down there?
Even in this rain the breath of the breeze is reaching me here

Here on this phone
A quarter a day room for me
And as things stay the same
I'm quickly running out of change
You're thinking on your feet
While you're sitting there on your ass
Fresh crease in your shirts
No stain of sweat on your back
There's no need
There's an employee
To make up for all of your slack
A seed don't make a tree
Without a servant who waters the grass",Eureka
