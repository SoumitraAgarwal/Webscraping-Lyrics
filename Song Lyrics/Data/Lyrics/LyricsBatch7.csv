Celine Dion,"Qu'est-ce qui se passe 
Quand on est lasse 
Quand le cœur a perdu ses couleurs? 
Une émotion 
Comme une invitation 
À chanter sans aucune raison 
Tout ça pour un regard ou deux 
Un sourire qui tremble un peu 
C'est l'amour, c'est l'accident 
On sent passer le courant 

On traverse un miroir 
Malgré la peur d'y croire 
On se dit que cette fois-ci 
On aime à la folie 
Une vie sans histoire 
C'est bien pire qu'un trou noir 
Sans hésiter, sans savoir 
On traverse un miroir 

Champagne en trop 
Rien n'est trop beau 
On a du mal à trouver les mots 
On dit tout bas n'importe quoi 
Pour étouffer l'envie de crier 
On se tait, on reste accroché 
Comme deux enfants désespérés 
On rêve de partager 
Une nuit comme au ciné 

On traverse un miroir 
Malgré la peur d'y croire 
On se dit que cette fois-ci 
On aime à la folie 
Une vie sans histoire 
C'est bien pire qu'un trou noir 
Sans hésiter, sans savoir 
On traverse un miroir 

On se tait, on reste accroché 
Comme deux enfants désespérés 
C'est l'amour, c'est l'accident 
On sent passer le courant 

On traverse un miroir 
Malgré la peur d'y croire 
On se dit que cette fois-ci 
On aime à la folie 
Une vie sans histoire 
C'est bien pire qu'un trou noir 
Sans hésiter, sans savoir 
On traverse un miroir 

On traverse un miroir",On Traverse un Miroir
Celine Dion,"J'ai du succès dans mes affaires
J'ai du succès dans mes amours
Je change souvent de secrétaire

J'ai mon bureau en haut d'une tour
D'où je vois la ville à l'envers
D'où je contrôle mon univers

Je passe la moitié de ma vie en l'air
Entre New York et Singapour
Je voyage toujours en première

J'ai ma résidence secondaire
Dans tous les Hilton de la terre
Je peux pas supporter la misère

Je suis pas heureux mais j'en ai l'air
J'ai perdu le sens de l'humour
Depuis que j'ai le sens des affaires

J'ai réussi et j'en suis fier
Au fond je n'ai qu'un seul regret
Je fais pas ce que j'aurais voulu faire

J'aurais voulu être un artiste
Pour pouvoir faire mon numéro
Quand l'avion se pose sur la piste
À Rotterdam ou à Rio
J'aurais voulu être un chanteur
Pour pouvoir crier qui je suis
J'aurais voulu être un auteur
Pour pouvoir inventer ma vie

J'aurais voulu être un acteur
Pour tous les jours changer de peau
Et pour pouvoir me trouver beau
Sur un grand écran en couleurs

J'aurais voulu être un artiste
Pour pouvoir être un anarchiste
Et vivre comme un millionnaire

J'aurais voulu être un artiste
Pour avoir le monde à refaire
Pour pouvoir dire pourquoi j'existe",Le Blues du Businessman
Celine Dion,"Come on baby, fais-moi une chanson 
Réponds au moins au téléphone

Préférée...c'est d'avoir du fun 

Mais moi j'ai besoin de ma chanson

J'suis bookée à la télévision 
Dans tous les shows de promotion

De quoi j'vais avoir l'air?

Sinon mon planning tombe à l'eau 

Donne-moi au moins l'idée du refrain 
Faut que j'tourne une vidéo - oh!

Celine Dion,"Elle
Avait dix huit ans
Les cheveux au vent
La ligne
D'un cygne
Qui dépliait ses...
Elle
Avait les accents
D'un oiseau chantant
Et tous les
Musiciens
Se retournaient sur...

Avait tout l'éclat
De ce siècle-là
Où la valse
Etait reine
Où l'amour était roi
Dans un ciel
De dentelles
Irré...
Elle
Promenait ses mains
Sur un clavecin
Et Chopin la trouvait

Qu'il composait pour elle

J'ai tant rêvé d'elle
Parlé avec elle
Que souvent
Je me prends

Celine Dion,"Tout comme son père
Le petit Jean-Pierre
Était un fan
Un fan de Superman
Il collectionnait
Toutes les bandes dessinées
Où il pouvait voir son héros
Voler comme un oiseau

Jean-Pierre devait avoir huit ans hier
Et ses parents en étaient tellement fiers
Qu'ils décidèrent de faire
Pour son anniversaire
Un voyage éclair à New York
La ville de Superman
De leur chambre d'hôtel
Au cinquantième étage du Waldorf
La vue était si belle

Que leur première soirée
Ils la passèrent à regarder
Les lumières de Manhattan
Le lendemain
Ils marchèrent sur Broadway
Main dans la main
Comme dans un conte de fées

Et dans un magasin
Où l'on vend de tout de rien
Jean-Pierre se fit offrir par son père
Un costume de Superman
Dès ce soir-là
Il voulu le porter
Comme pyjama
Pour pouvoir mieux rêver

Mais quand ses parents
Se furent endormis
Tout près de lui dans le grand lit
Il se leva sans bruit
Il ouvrit la fenêtre
Et quand il vit apparaître
Les lumières de Manhattan
Il voulut s'envoler
Dans la nuit étoilée
Comme un oiseau qui plane

C'est justement hier
Qu'on a porté en terre
Jean-Pierre
Le fils de Superman",Le Fils de Superman
Celine Dion,"L'avenir est planétaire
Y'a six milliards d'humains sur terre
Mais chacun vie sa vie en solitaire

Chacun a ses habitudes
Chacun a ses certitudes
Et l'amour est la pire des solitudes

Quand l'univers m'indiffère
Quand j'ai plus envie de rien faire
Quand la vie m'endort comme un somnifère

J'ai inventé la formule
Qui vaut mieux que toutes les pilules
Même si ça me donne l'air d'une somnambule

Je de-de-de-danse dans ma tête
Je de-de-de-danse dans ma tête
Je de-de-de-danse dans ma tête

Que je sois debout dans le métro
Que je sois assise à mon bureau
Tous les jours les mêmes mots
Les mêmes gestes de robot

Y a de quoi devenir fou
Et vous qu'en pensez-vous?
Y a vraiment de quoi devenir fou
Mais moi je m'en fout

Je de-de-de-danse dans ma tête
Je de-de-de-danse dans ma tête
Je de-de-de-danse dans ma tête

Quoi qu'on fasse ou quoi qu'on dise
De partout on nous satellise
On nous épie, on nous informatise

À force de la regarder
Je commence à me demander
Si ma télé ne va pas m'avaler

Dehors les néons s'allument
All right!
Je préfère regarder la lune
All night
Étendue nue sur mon lit
Dans la chaleur de la nuit

Les sirènes de police
Hurlent comme des loups
Je voudrais comme Alice
Tomber dans un grand trou

Celine Dion,"There ain't a dream that don't have a chance
To come true now
It just takes a little faith baby
Anything that we want to do
We can do now
There ain't nothing in our way baby
Nothing our love couldn't rise above
We can get through the night
We can get to the light
Long as we got our love to light the way

With a little faith
Just a little trust
If you believe in love
Love can move mountains
Believe in your heart
And feel, feel it in your soul
And love baby love can love can move mountains

Oceans deep and mountains high
They can't stop us
Because love is on our side baby
We can reach the heavens and touch the sky
Just believe it, believe in you and I baby
If we got love that is strong enough
We can do anything, make it through anything
'Cause through it all love will always find a way

With a little faith...

You believe in me
I'll believe in you
If we believe in each other
Nothing we can't do
If we got love that is strong enough
Love will find a way

With a little faith?",Love Can Move Mountains
Celine Dion,"Comme tous les matins 
Le soleil se lève 
Entre les buildings 

Vers sept heure et demie
J'ouvre ma fenêtre
Toujours le même homme qui fait son jogging! 

Je m'habille
Je me maquille
J'avale un grand café noir 

Mes lunettes
Ma malette
Accessoires obligatoires 

Les miroirs
Du couloir
Multiplient ma silhouette 

L'ascenceur
Me fait peur
À chaque étage, mon cœur s'arrête

Donnez-moi
Donnez-moi de l'oxygène
Donnez-moi de l'oxygène

Dans une cour d'école
Un enfant qui joue
Avec un ballon vert
Porte tout à coup
La main à son cou
En tombant par terre, étouffé par l'air 

À midi
Et demi
Encore un grand café noir 

Je ne mange
Qu'une orange
Pour tenir le coup jusqu'au soir 

Je m'étends
Un instant
Les jambes à la verticale 

Je respire
Et j'expire
Dans un mouvement machinal

Donnez-moi
Donnez-moi de l'oxygène
Donnez-moi de l'oxygène

Dans une ambulance
Traversant la ville
À deux cents à l'heure
On mène à l'urgence
Um homme immobile
Avec une pile à la place du cœur 

Toute la s'maine
J'me démène
De neuf heures jusqu'à cinq heures 

Le trafic
Me panique
Quand je roule à la noirceur 

Le parking
Du building
À toujours la même odeur 

En rentrant
Dans l'apartement
J'allume mon climatiseur

Donnez-moi
Donnez-moi de l'oxygène
Donnez-moi de l'oxygène",Oxygene
Celine Dion,"Quand on n'a que l'amour
À s'offrir en partage
Au jour du grand voyage
Qu'est notre grand amour

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Mon amour toi et moi
Pour qu'éclatent de joie
Chaque heure et chaque jour

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour vivre nos promesses
Sans nulle autre richesse
Que d'y croire toujours

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour meubler de merveilles
Et couvrir de soleil
La laideur des faubourgs

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour unique raison
Pour unique chanson
Et unique secours

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour habiller matin
Pauvres et malandrins
De manteaux de velours

Quand on n'a que l'amour
À offrir en prière
Pour les maux de la terre
En simple troubadour

Quand on n'a que l'amour
À offrir à ceux-là
Dont l'unique combat
Est de chercher le jour

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour parler aux canons
Et rien qu'une chanson
Pour convaincre un tambour

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour tracer un chemin
À chaque carrefour

Alors, sans avoir rien
Que la force d'aimer
Nous aurons dans nos mains
Ma mie, le monde entier",Quand on N'A Que l'Amour
Celine Dion,"Ziggy, il s'appelle Ziggy
Je suis folle de lui
C'est un garçon pas comme les autres
Mais moi je l'aime, c'est pas d'ma faute
Même si je sais
Qu'il ne m'aimera jamais

Ziggy, his name is Ziggy 
I'm crazy about him 
He's a boy like no other 
But I love him, it's not my fault 
Even if I know 
That he will never love me
Ziggy, il s'appelle Ziggy
Je suis folle de lui
La première fois que je l'ai vu
Je m'suis jetée sur lui dans la rue
J'lui ai seulement dit
Que j'avais envie de lui

Ziggy, his name is Ziggy 
I'm crazy about him 
The first time I saw him 
I jumped on him on the street 
I simply told him 
That I wanted him
Il était quatre heures du matin
J'étais seule et j'avais besoin
De parler à quelqu'un
Il m'a dit, ""Viens prendre un café""
Et on s'est raconté nos vies
On a ri, on a pleuré

It was four o'clock in the morning 
I was alone and I needed 
To talk to someone 
He told me, ""Come take a coffee"" 
And we told each other's lives 
We laughed, and we cried
Ziggy, il s'appelle Ziggy
C'est mon seul ami
Dans sa tête y'a que d'la musique
Il vend des disques dans une boutique
On dirait qu'il vit dans une autre galaxie

Ziggy, his name is Ziggy 
He's my only friend 
In his head there's only music 
He sells discs in a boutique 
We could say he's living in another galaxy
Tous les soirs, il m'emmène danser
Dans des endroits très, très gais
Où il a des tas d'amis
Oui, je sais, il aime les garçons
Je devrais me faire une raison
Essayer de l'oublier, mais

Every night, he takes me dancing 
In very, very cheerful places 
Where he has lots of friends 
Yes, I know, he likes boys 
I should reason myself 
Trying to forget him, but
Ziggy, il s'appelle Ziggy
Je suis folle de lui
C'est un garçon pas comme les autres
Et moi je l'aime, c'est pas d'ma faute
Même si je sais
Qu'il ne m'aimera jamais

Celine Dion,"Ça t'arrive sans crier gare
Au milieu d'une heure incolore

Un geste, une odeur, un regard
Qui comme déchire ton décor

Tout à coup, ce cœur qui t'avait presque oublié
Se pointe à ta porte et se remet à cogner

Attention, le ballet va commencer

Tu comprends pas trop ce qui t'arrive
Tu crois d'abord à une erreur

Tu l'évites et lui te devine
Entre le désir et la peur

Tu t'entends lui dire des phrases sans aucun sens
Qu'importe, les mots n'ont plus la moindre d'importance

Car le ballet a commencé

Il met ses plus beaux atours et du miel sur sa voix
Toi, tu te fais velours et tes bijoux brillent sur toi
Il te dit poèmes et rêves et lointains voyages
Tu réponds Florence, peinture, impeccables images

Dames et cavaliers, avancez

Un coup d'œil à son dos, ses hanches, quand s'efface le galantin
Un regard quand elle se penche et laisse deviner un sein
Elle sait déjà ses mains, les contours de sa bouche
Le cambré de ses reins, qu'elle a noté en douce

Car le ballet va s'animer

Il a su les codes et donne les bons mots de passe
Encore un peu d'alcool et que tombent les cuirasses
Livrées, les clés des corps, enfin les peaux s'embrassent
Et le temps s'arrête tant que dure la grâce

Car le ballet est bientôt terminé

Et la vraie vie a commencé
Eh oui, la vraie vie",Le Ballet
Celine Dion,"Quand marcher sans autre but
Plus de passé, demain fourbu
Dans le néant du froid de la rue

Quand les mots n'existent plus
Quand l'espérance oubliée, dissolue
Quand les alcools, même, ne saoulent plus
Restent les phrases écorchées
De ces phrases qu'on jette avant de renoncer

Les derniers seront les premiers
Dans l'autre réalité
Nous serons princes d'éternité

Un billet sur le trottoir
Dans un journal, d'autres histoires
Un rayon de soleil au hasard

Une fleur abandonnée
Ce que les autres ont laissé de côté
Plus assez neuf, plus assez
Quand ta place est au-dehors
Ne reste que ces phrases comme île au trésor

Les derniers seront les premiers
Dans l'autre réalité
Nous serons princes d'éternité

Les derniers seront les premiers

Celine Dion,"Et j'écoutais longtemps couler l'eau des fontaines
Et j'écoutais le vent chanter infiniment
Vagues de quiétude et de paix d'aussi loin que je me souvienne
L'enfance est un immense océan

Et je rêvais longues années, longue indolence
Où rien ne se passe mais où rien ne s'oublie
J'allais, sereine et sans connaître le moindre feu d'une absence

Ce n'est qu'en te croisant
Que j'ai su, j'ai compris

J'attendais, j'attendais
J'attendais ton regard pour expliquer enfin
Le pourquoi de ces ""au revoir""
À tout ce long chemin

J'attendais, j'attendais
Le pays de ton corps, le toucher de tes mains
Ma douce boussole, mon nord
Le sens à mes demains

Et j'abordais les troubles, rives adolescentes
Les doutes, les jeux, les mauvais courants
Je me souviens les coups de sang, des musiques et des mots de France
Amants d'avant

Y'a bien des vies qu'on nourrit d'étude ou de science
Destins faits d'aventures, de records ou d'argent
Des vies d'écriture et de voyage ou de rêves de puissance
J'y pensais bien de temps en temps
En écoutant le vent

J'attendais, j'attendais
J'attendais ton regard pour expliquer enfin
Le pourquoi de ces ""au revoir""
À tout ce long chemin

J'attendais, j'attendais
J'attendais ton amour
Ton beau, ton bel amour
Je l'attendais pour enfin vivre
En donnant à mon tour

Celine Dion,"Détourner des rivières, porter des poids
Traverser des mers, je saurais faire

Défier des machines, narguer des lois
Les foudres divines, ça m'effraie pas

J'sais prendre un coup, le rendre aussi
River des clous, ça j'ai appris

J'suis pas victime, j'suis pas colombe
Et pour qu'on m'abîme, faut que je tombe

Je sais les hivers, je sais le froid
Mais la vie sans toi, je sais pas

Je savais le silence depuis longtemps
J'en sais la violence, son goût de sang

Rouges colères, sombres douleurs
Je sais ces guerres, j'en ai pas peur

Je sais me défendre, j'ai bien appris
On est pas des tendres par ici

Je sais les hivers (sais les hivers), je sais le froid (le froid)

Raisonnable et nouveau, c'est ainsi par ici
Que les choses ont changé, que les fleurs ont fané
Que le temps d'avant, c'était le temps d'avant
Que si tout zappe et lasse, les amours aussi passent

Il faut que tu saches

J'irai chercher ton cœur si tu l'emportes ailleurs
Même si dans tes danses d'autres dansent tes heures
J'irai chercher ton âme dans les froids, dans les flammes
Je te jetterai des sorts pour que tu m'aimes encore

Fallait pas commencer, m'attirer, me toucher
Fallait pas tant donner, moi, je sais pas jouer
On me dit qu'aujourd'hui, on me dit que les autres font ainsi
Je ne suis pas les autres
Avant que l'on s'attache, avant que l'on se gâche

Même si dans tes danses d'autres dansent tes heures
J'irai chercher ton âme dans les froids, dans les flammes
Je te jetterai des sorts pour que tu m'aimes encore

Je trouverai des langages pour chanter tes louanges
Je ferai nos bagages pour d'infinies vendanges
Les formules magiques des marabouts d'Afrique
Je les dirai sans remords pour que tu m'aimes encore

Je m'inventerai reine pour que tu me retiennes
Je me ferai nouvelle pour que le feu reprenne
Je deviendrai ces autres qui te donnent du plaisir

Plus brillante, plus belle pour une autre étincelle

Celine Dion,"C'est comme une machine à fond de train
Une locomotive qui foncerait sans fin

Des coups, des secousses, je m'habitue pas
Qui conduit, qui pousse ce train, qui sait où il va?

Faites que l'on arrête, appelez-moi le contrôleur

Et toi, qu'est-ce que tu fous là? (toi, qu'est-ce-que tu fous là?)
Sur ton sofa (sur ton sofa) à côté de moi (ye-ye-yeah)

Tu vois pas que je crève, (non, non) que j'suis vidée? (vidée)
Que j'ai plus de sève, (plus de sève) que je vais lâcher

C'est le miroir où j'existe
Et sans eux, je ne me vois pas

Mais tout nous aspire, petits écrans
Faut montrer le pire ailleurs pour accepter nos néants

Si t'y prends pas garde, avec le temps
Tu te fous des gares et jamais plus tu ne redescends

Les tempes qui cognent, ça me reprend
Ou tu te raisonnes, ou tu prends des médicaments

La fin de l'histoire et pourquoi, ou et comment
Qui sont les bons et les méchants?

I think of all the friends I've known
But when I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

All by myself
Don't want to be, all by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't want to live, all by myself anymore

Hard to be sure
Some times I feel so insecure
And love so distant and obscure
Remains the cure",All by Myself
Celine Dion,"For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful baby
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through through it all

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

You were my strength when I was weak

I'm everything I am
Because you loved me",Because You Loved Me
Celine Dion,"Close the door
Shut the world away
All the fight's gone from this wounded heart
Across the floor
Dreams and shadows play
(Call) call the man
Who deals in love beyond repair
He can heal the world
Oh hearts in need of care
(Shine) shine a light ahead
When the next step is unclear
Call the man
He's needed here
I close my eyes
I remember when
Your sweet love filled this empty room
The tears I cry
Won't bring it back again
Unless the lonely star should fall
Needed in the chaos and confusion
From the plains to City Hall
Needed where the proud who walk the wire are set to fall
Woah, call the man
Who deals in once upon a time
Maybe he
Can mend this broken heart of mine
Shine a light ahead
Now the future isn't clear
Isn't clear
Call the man
He's needed here
Call the man
He's needed here
Oh yeah
Ah, mmm
He's needed here
Right here
He's needed here, right now, yeah",Call the Man
Celine Dion,"Lyin' in my bed
Thoughts in my head
Visions of you
But I can't get through the night

So pick up the phone
I know you're home
You're playin' with my heart
And you know that it just ain't right

It's just a game of love, love, love
And even though it's hard baby
I can never give you up

You're the one I'm dreamin' of
I can't live without your love
Tonight
And it's you that I adore
You're the one that I live for
Inside
Of you, I'm dreamin' of you

So I get in the car
But I didn't get far
'Cause the radio played
Every song that I sang with you

Yesterday's gone
And it may be true
But you know that
I'll never get over you

It's just a game of love, love love
And even though it hurts me baby
I can never give you up

'Cause you're the one I'm dreamin' of
I can't live without your love
Tonight
And it's you that I adore
You're the one that I live for
Inside
Of you, I'm dreamin' of you

You, you gave me love
Love gave us hope and strength
To carry on and
You, you gave me faith
When I was fallin' down
You would pick me up, my love

You're the one I'm dreamin' of
I can't live without your love
Tonight
And it's you that I adore
You're the one that I live for
Inside
Baby, baby, baby, baby
You're the one I'm dreamin' of
I can't live without your love

I'm dreamin' of you",Dreamin' of You
Celine Dion,"And in your eyes I see ribbons of color
I see us inside of each other
I feel my unconscious merge with yours
And I hear a voice say, What's his is hers

I'm falling into you
This dream could come true
And it feels so good falling into you

I was afraid to let you in here
Now I have learned love can't be made in fear
The walls begin to tumble down
And I can't even see the ground

I'm falling into you
This dream could come true
And it feels so good falling into you

Falling like a leaf, falling like a star
Finding a belief, falling where you are

Catch me, don't let me drop!
Love me, don't ever stop!

So close your eyes and let me kiss you
And while you sleep I will miss you

I'm falling into you
This dream could come true
And it feels so good falling into you

Falling like a leaf, falling like a star
Finding a belief, falling where you are

Falling into you
Falling into you
Falling into you",Falling into You
Celine Dion,"Fly, fly little wing
Fly beyond imagining
The softest cloud, the whitest dove
Upon the wind of heaven's love
Past the planets and the stars
Leave this lonely world of ours
Escape the sorrow and the pain
And fly again

Fly, fly precious one
Your endless journey has begun
Take your gentle happiness
Far too beautiful for this
Cross over to the other shore
There is peace forevermore
But hold this memory bittersweet
Until we meet

Fly, fly do not fear
Don't waste a breath, don't shed a tear
Your heart is pure, your soul is free
Be on your way, don't wait for me
Above the universe you'll climb
On beyond the hands of time
The moon will rise, the sun will set
But I won't forget

Fly, fly little wing
Fly where only angels sing
Fly away, the time is right
Go now, find the light",Fly
Celine Dion,"A mountain of stone a door of steel 
Can't stand in my way I'd go on 
Brutal machines unbending laws 
Can't slow me down I'd go on 
I've learned how to deal and when to fight 
I know what's real I know what's right 
I'm not afraid a wounded dove 
I can be tender in a world so tough 

I'm sure I could face the bitter cold 
But life without you I don't know 

The winds of the heart can blow me down 
But I get right up and I stand my ground 
I've tasted fear, my share of pain 
The wasted tears of love in vain 
I've held you tight, pushed you away 
Now with all my might I beg you to stay 

I'm sure I could face the bitter cold 
But life without you, I don't know 

I know what I want, I know what I need 
But there's just one thing I must believe 
Deep in the night by a dying flame 
You will be there when I call your name 

I'm sure I could face the bitter cold 
But life without you, I don't know 

I don't know 
I don't know 
I don't know 
I don't know",I Don't Know
Celine Dion,"I must be crazy now
Maybe I dream too much
But when I think of you
I long to feel your touch

To whisper in your ear
Words that are old as time
Words only you would hear
If only you were mine

I wish I could go back to the very first day I saw you
Should've made my move when you looked in my eyes
'Cause by now I know that you'd feel the way that I do
And I'd whisper these words as you'd lie here by my side

I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

So today, I finally find the courage deep inside
Just to walk right up to your door
But my body can't move when I finally get to it
Just like a thousand times before

Then without a word he handed me this letter
Read I hope this finds the way into your heart, it said
I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

Well maybe I, I need a little love yeah
And maybe I, I need a little care
And maybe I, maybe you, maybe you, maybe you
Oh you need somebody just to hold you
If you do, just reach out and I'll be there

I love you, please say
You love me too
Please say you love me too
Till the end of time
These three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together

Oh, I love you
Please say you love me too
Please please
Say you love me too
Till the end of time
My baby
Together, together, forever
Till the end of time
I love you
I will be your light
Shining bright
Shining through your eyes

Celine Dion,"You're the bravest of hearts you're the strongest of souls 
You're my light in the dark you're the place I call home 
You can say it's all right but I know that you're breaking up inside 
I see it in your eyes 
Even you face the night afraid and alone 
That's why I'll be there 

When the storm rises up when the shadows descend 
Every beat of my heart every day without end 
Every second I live that's the promise I make 
Baby, that's what I'll give, if that's what it takes 
If that's what it takes 

You can sleep in my arms, you don't have to explain 
When your heart's crying out, baby, whisper my name 
'Cause I've reached out for you when the thunder is crashing up above 
You've given me your love 
When your smile like the sun that shines through the pain 
That's why I'll be there 

When the storm rises up, when the shadows descend 
Every beat of my heart, every day without end 
I will stand like a rock, I will bend till I break 
'Til there's no more to give, if that's what it takes 
I will risk everything, I will fight, I will bleed 
I will lay down my life, if that's what you need 
Every second I live, that's the promise I make 
Baby, that's what I'll give, if that's what it takes 

Through the wind and the rain, through the smoke and the fire 
When the fear rises up, when the wave's ever higher 
I will lay down my heart, my body, my soul 
I will hold on all night and never let go

And it gets higher, day by day

And do I love you my oh my
Yeah river deep mountain high
If I lost you would I cry
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby

When you were a young boy
Did you have a puppy
That always followed you around
Well I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy
No I'll never let you down

Cause it grows stronger, like a river flows
And it gets bigger baby, and heaven knows
And it gets sweeter baby, as it grows

And do I love you my oh my

If I lost you would I cry
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby

Or your sweetest caress

I've given up on yesterday
Here and now is all that matters
Right here with you is where I'll stay

Everything in this world
Every voice in the night
Every little thing of beauty
Comes shining through in your eyes
And all that is you becomes part of me too
'Cause all you do seduces me

And if I should die tomorrow
I'd go down with a smile on my face
I thank God I've ever known you
I fall down on my knees

That every breath I take for love

Niles to go before I sleep

Lifted like a pebble from the beach to the skies 
I could build you a bridge that spans the ocean wide 
But the greatest gift I give you would be to stand by your side

But they can't take away the love that lives inside us always

So spread your wings and fly,
Guide your spirit safe and sheltered,

Carrying all of his treasures from the stars
To a rainbow which leads to where we are.

Heart would surely die without you

I tried to swallow my pride
But I felt my heart start to tremble inside
Wish I didn't know cause I can't let you go
Tell me

Why
Why when I looked in your eyes
I felt my heart start to cry
My o my
When I saw you with the other girl

Ooh why,
Why did you have to lie
Cause I felt the trust start to die
Why o why
When I still love you
It's so hard to say goodbye

How can you tell me it was nothing
Cause you took away everything I dreamed in
Just a night and I held you tight
When you know you were sleeping in my bed

I tried to swallow my pride
But I felt my heart start to tremble inside
Wish I didn't know cause I can't let you go
Tell me

Why
Why when I looked in your eyes
I felt my heart start to cry
My o my
When I saw you with the other girl

Ooh why,
Why did you have to lie
Cause I felt the trust start to die
Why o why
When I still love you
It's so hard to say goodbye

Should I quietly leave through the door
Or maybe pretend the way things were once before
When I met you
I'll never forget you, so

Why
Why when I looked in your eyes
I felt my heart start to cry
My o my
When I saw you with the other girl

With sweet ""I Love You's"" and some pretty lines

No you'll never steal my heart away

It's all in the things that you do 
I'm telling you 

If you want me to believe 
That I'm the only one you need 
I need lovin' proof 
I need lovin' proof 
Baby hold me in your arms 
And show me something from the heart 
Give me lovin' proof 
I need lovin' proof from you, ooh baby 

And if the love you got is strong and true 
And if you love me like you say you do 
Your tender touch will tell the honest truth 
And your kiss can never tell a lie 
'Cause I'd see it in your eyes 
There's one way to ease any doubt 
I tell you now 

If you want me to believe 
That I'm the only one you need 
I need lovin' proof 
Baby I won't be impressed 
Unless I get some tenderness 
Give me lovin' proof 
I need lovin' proof from you, ooh baby 

(I need lovin' proof) 
If the love is right 
(I need lovin' proof) 
Prove it to me all night

A l'amour fou a l'infini

Et prier cet homme sur la croix
see'est encore se donner a lui
Et quand lui viennent ces idees la
see'est a peine si elle en rougit
La religieuse a comme moi
Des nuits d'amour en nostalgie
La religieuse a quelques fois
Des sanglots longs de jalousie

Meme a genoux meme en priere
Elle entend sa voix qui l'appelle
Elle voit des bateaux sur la mer
Elle revoit des chambres d'hotel

De l'autre cote de ce mur
Il why a le soleil de la vie
Il why a des levres qui murmurent
A des levres assoiffees d'envie

Et prier cet homme sur la croix
see'est encore se donner a lui
Et quand lui viennent ces idees la
see'est a peine si elle en rougit
La religieuse a comme moi
Des nuits d'amour en nostalgie
La religieuse a quelques fois
Des sanglots longs de jalousie

Meme a genoux meme en priere
Elle a des frissons de desir
Tellement de sorciers l'ensorcellent
Que le diable why prend do plaisir

Elle a beau nouer ses cheveux
Sous une cornette anonyme
Elle ne sait pas baisser les yeux
La peur do mal l'enfeminine

Et prier cet homme sur la croix
see'est encore se donner a lui
Et quand lui viennent ces idees la
see'est a peine si elle en rougit

Celine Dion,"Il est arrivé 
Par un matin de mai 
Et du premier jour 
J'ai su que je l'aimais
Vous allez sourire
Il m'a semblé que j'avais
Du soleil au cœur
Du soleil au cœur
C'étrait lui
Qui brillait dans ma vie 

Le temps a passé
Si bien que je ne sais
Si on s'est connus
Un jour ou une année
Mais je peux vous dire
Que j'ai encore aujourd'hui
Du soleil au cœur
Du soleil au cœur
Comme au jour
De notre premier jour 

Je me dis souvent 

Pour combien de temps 

Encore un moment
Ou cent mille ans
Tant que je vivrai
Jamais je n'oublierai

De ce matin de mai
Tout au fond de moi
Je sais que j'aurai toujours

Un jour s'arrêtera",Du Soleil au Coeur

I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Celine Dion,"Le soleil en automne, indulgent 
Les peaux nues se donnent aux tièdes vents 
Là-bas les tempos paraissent 
Battre au rythme paresseux du temps 
L'abandon, tout s'apprend 

Caresses des vagues aux chauds courants 
Le sable doux, bel et tendre amant 
Là-bas les danses infinies 
Nous mélangent et l'amour aime la vie 
L'abandon, c'est appris, la nature initie ici 

On sait déjà ces moments-là 
Le soleil avait préparé ça 
L'abandon tout petit 
Les îles initient à l'amour ici 

On sait déjà, ces rythmes-là 
Les feux d'en bas, ce lascif état 
La chaleur et le vent 
Oh, tout doucement 
Mon île m'apprend 

Le rhum aux hommes attendrit les bras 
Le rire aux femmes, aux filles, aux éclats 
Les nuits velours ici-bas 
Les mêmes à Panama, mêmes à Cuba 
L'amour a faim de toi et vice versa 

Des corps à corps, amoureux soldats 
Le plaisir en ces brûlants combats 
Tout ici: l'eau, le climat 
Tout est désir, on n'y échappe pas 
L'abandon, tout s'apprend 
Dans les danses et les jeux d'enfants 

Un pas de toi, un pas de moi 
Les bassins collent et bougent tout bas 
Tout s'apprend, l'abandon 
Je vais où tu vas et même au-delà 
Un pas de toi, un pas de moi 
Les bassins collent et bougent tout bas 
Tout s'apprend, l'abandon 
Je vais où tu vas et même au-delà 

Tout contre toi, la nuit sans loi 
Que l'instant nous soulève et basta 
Le moment, ce moment, rien n'est plus 
Important que ça 

On sait déjà ces moments-là 
Le soleil avait préparé ça 
La chaleur et le vent 
Oh, tout doucement 
Mon île m'apprend",L' Abandon
Celine Dion,"Loin, loin, c'était certain
Comme une immense faim, un animal instinct
Oh, partir, partir et filer plus loin
Tout laisser, quitter tout, rejoindre un destin

Bye bye, mais faut que je m'en aille
Adieu tendres années, salut champs de bataille
Et sentir, oh sentir et lâcher les chiens
Y'a trop de trains qui passent, ce train c'est le mien

Et tant pis pour moi, et tant pis pour nous
J'aurais pu rester où la roue tourne, où tout est doux
Moi j'avais pas le choix, ça cognait partout
Le monde est à ta porte et se joue des verrous

Rendez-vous dans un autre monde ou dans une autre vie
Quand les nuits seront plus longues plus longues que mes nuits
Et mourir, oh mourir, mais de vivre et d'envie
Rendez-vous quand j'aurai dévoré mes appétits

Beau, beau de bas en haut
J'aimais manger sa peau j'aimais boire à ses mots
Mais trop tard, ou brouillard, ou bien trop tôt
c'était la bonne histoire mais pas le bon tempo

Bye bye, faut que je m'en aille
Une croix sur ses lèvres et ma vie qui s'écaille
Et s'offrir et souffrir et tomber de haut
Et descendre et descendre au fond sur le carreau

Et tant pis pour moi, et tant pis pour lui
Je pourrais l'attendre ici, rien ne s'oublie tout est gris
Moi j'avais pas le choix, ça cognait aussi
C'est le monde à ta porte et tu lui dis merci

Rendez-vous dans un autre monde ou dans une autre vie
Quand les nuits seront plus longues plus longues que mes nuits
Et mourir, oh mourir, mais de vivre et d'envie
Rendez-vous quand j'aurai dévoré mes appétits

Rendez-vous dans un autre monde ou dans une autre vie
Une autre chance, une seconde et tant pis pour celle-ci
Et puis rire à périr, mais rire aujourd'hui
Rendez-vous quelque part entre ailleurs et l'infini
Rendez-vous quand j'aurai dévoré mes appétits
Rendez-vous quelque part entre ailleurs et l'infini
C'est le monde à ta porte et tu lui dis merci

Rendez-vous dans une autre monde ou dans une autre vie
Une autre chance, une seconde et tant pis pour celle-ci

Ticket pour autre rencontre, rencard au paradis
Et puis rire à périr mais rire aujourd'hui
Au plaisir à plus tard et plus tard est si joli",Dans un Autre Monde
Celine Dion,"En attendant ses pas, je mets la musique en sourdine, tout bas 
Trop bête, on ne sait pas, s'il sonnait
Si je n'entendais pas cette fois 
En attendant ses pas ce matin-là

Un soir? Un matin? Un hiver, une aube 
Un printemps qu'il choisira
Rien, je n'en sais rien, je mets des lumières 
Les nuits au bord des chemins

En attendant ses bras je peins des fleurs aux portes 
Il aimera ça
En attendant le doux temps de ses bras 

Et je prends soin de moi, rouge à mes lèvres, à mes joues 
Pour qu'il ne voit pas
Quand trop pale parfois, ne surtout pas 
Qu'il me surprenne comme ça

Il y a de l'eau fraîche et du vin 
Je ne sais pas ce qu'il choisira
Je ne sais s'il est blond, s'il est brun 
Je ne sais s'il est grand ou pas
Mais en entendant sa voix je saurai 
Que tous ses mots, tous seront pour moi
En attendant le doux temps de ses bras 

J'y pense tout le temps à cet instant, oh quand on se reconnaîtra 
Je lui dirai c'était bien long, non, je ne lui dirai sûrement pas
En attendant ses pas, je vis, je rêve et je respire pour ça 
En attendant juste un sens à tout ça

Celine Dion,"Et quand nous aurons fait le tour de nos ultimes projets
Quand nous apprendrons a aimer nos échecs et nos regrets
Quand nous en serons a ouvrir nos livres de souvenirs
Je chanterai, je chanterai, je chanterai, je chanterai toujours

Quand les rêves de nos enfants deviendront nos espérances
Quand leurs chagrins d'amour seront les nôtres et notre souffrance
Quand nos regards nous suffiront, quand nos pas seront les mêmes
Je chanterai, je chanterai, je chanterai, je chanterai toujours

On dit ces choses, on oublie parfois, quand on rêve
Ou qu'on est ivre
Je te les dirai cent mille fois, et ça m'aide tant a vivre

Quand nos passes, quand tous ces jours seront notre vraie richesse
Quand je saurai tout de tes dons, quand je saurai tes faiblesses
Quand l'amour aura d'autres goûts que la passion, le désir

Celine Dion,"Je crains la nuit quand tu n'es pas là  
Ce tout petit au-delà  
Je crains le silence après les voix 
Ce froid si froid 

Je crains les rues, le jour et les gens 
Et la solitude autant 
Je prie qu'on ne me remarque pas 
Moi je crois toi, toi je te crois 

La pluie, les éclairs et les chats noirs 
La vie me glace d'effroi 
Soudain je sursaute en ne croisant qu'un miroir 
Mais n'ai-je peur que de moi? 

Je crains les promesses et les serments 
Les cris, les mots séduisants 
Je me méfie si souvent de moi 
Mais de toi, pas, toi je te crois 

La pluie, les éclairs et les chats noirs 
La vie me glace d'effroi 
Mais quand je sursaute en ne croisant qu'un miroir 
N'aurais-je peur que de moi? 

Je crains les saints, le mal et le bien 
Je crains le monde et ses lois 
Quand tout m'angoisse, quand tout s'éteint

Je te crois, toi 
Toi, je te crois 
Moi, je te crois",Je Crois Toi
Celine Dion,"On ne change pas
On met juste les costumes d'autres sur soi
On ne change pas
Une veste ne cache qu'un peu de ce qu'on voit
On ne grandit pas
On pousse un peu, tout juste
Le temps d'un rêve, d'un songe
Et les toucher du doigt

Mais on n'oublie pas
L'enfant qui reste, presque nu
Les instants d'innocence
Quand on ne savait pas

On ne change pas
On attrape des airs et des poses de combat
On ne change pas
On se donne le change, on croit
Que l'on fait des choix
Mais si tu grattes là
Tout près de l'apparence tremble
Un petit qui nous ressemble
On sait bien qu'il est là
On l'entend parfois
Sa rengaine insolente
Qui s’entête et qui répète
Oh ne me quitte pas

On n'oublie jamais
On a toujours un geste
Qui trahit qui l'on est
Un prince, un valet
Sous la couronne un regard
Une arrogance, un trait
D'un prince ou d'un valet
Je sais tellement ça
J'ai copié des images
Et des rêves que j'avais
Tous ces milliers de rêves
Mais si près de moi
Une petite fille maigre
Marche à Charlemagne, inquiète
Et me parle tout bas

On ne change pas, on met juste
Les costumes d'autres et voilà
On ne change pas, on ne cache
Qu'un instant de soi

Une petite fille
Ingrate et solitaire marche
Et rêve dans les neiges
En oubliant le froid

Si je la maquille
Elle disparaît un peu,
Le temps de me regarder faire
Et se moquer de moi

Une petite fille
Une toute petite fille
Une toute petite fille
Une toute petite fille",On Ne Change Pas

Aux jours, plus courts
Qui retiennent
Mon corps et ma voix

Que je vous aime

Cocon qui s'éveille
Aux seuls parfums

Au fond de mes rêves
Souvent
Quand mes yeux s'éclairent

Papillon éphémère
Aux ailes de verre
Prisonnière du fil de vos secrets

De vous, si doux

Comment lui faire lire au fond de mes pensées?

Mais comment font ces autres à qui tout réussit?
Qu'on me dise mes fautes, mes chimères aussi

Je ferais de ce monde un rêve, une éternité

J'ai du sang dans mes songes, un pétale sèche
Quand des larmes me rongent que d'autres ont versées
La vie n'est pas étanche, mon île est sous le vent
Les portes laissent entrer les cris même en fermant

Dans un jardin, l'enfant, sur un balcon des fleurs
Ma vie paisible où j'entends battre tous les cœurs
Quand les nuages foncent, présages des malheurs
Quelles armes répondent aux pays de nos peurs?

Celine Dion,"Sur les passerelles à l'embarquement
Populaires ou premières, derrière ou devant
On monte les malles, des quais sur le pont
On charge dans les cales de l'acier, des jurons
Ne manque plus qu'un signe, du capitaine un mot
Des cabines aux cuisines
Sur le même bateau
Un doigt de champagne, un toast au départ
Dans les soutes, le bagne et les heures de quart
Des soirées mondaines, des valses ou tangos
Aux ombres, à la peine, un mauvais tord boyau
En attendant l'escale, Athènes ou Macao
Sous les mêmes étoiles
Sur le même bateau

Au feu des machines, souffre matelot
Près de la piscine, les belles et les beaux
Des salles de moteurs, des salons joyaux
Ici la sueur, le plus grand luxe en haut
Mais vienne une tempête, une lame en sursaut
Toutes les âmes s'inquiètent
Sur le même bateau

Quand les astres s'en mêlent sur l'immense océan
Quand tout devient si frêle face aux éléments
Plus de rang, plus de classe, plus de bagne ou de beau
Chacun la même angoisse

Que font les amants qui se retrouvent?
Que dois-je mettre ce soir?

Celine Dion,"""I woke up this morning, baby
The blues was pouring out of me""
Cent fois, ces mots je les ai dits
Ces mots que d'autres avaient écrits
De toute ma voix, de toute mon âme
""With all the soul that I can""
Le blues comme on me l'a appris
""I woke up this morning, baby""
Mais ce matin-là, j'ai compris

La peine aux longs champs de coton
J'imaginais de mon cocon
Les coups, le sang, les temps boueux
J'avais mal en fermant les yeux
""His baby's far away""
J'ai des pardons, j'ai des prières
Mais l'blues c'est pas des phrases en l'air

""I woke up this morning, baby""
Mais ce matin t'as vraiment froid
Tu comprends du fond de ta poitrine
Tous les blues sont écrits pour toi

""Oh, oh I feel the blues in me
Nobody knows how I really feel
Nobody knows, nobody cares""
Les mots te brûlent un par un comme s'ils
Comme s'ils t'appartiennent enfin

Une tache, une faute et soudain tu comprends

Zora sourit, aux trottoirs, aux voitures, aux passants

À tout ce qui nous semble évident
Elle avance et bénit chaque instant

Just as many fourth of July's
And we're still holdin' it together
It only comes down to you and I

I know that you can still remember
Things we said right from the start
When we said that this could be special
I'm keepin' those words deep down in my heart

Another year has gone by
And I'm still the one by your side
After everything that's gone by
There's still no one saying goodbye
Though another year has gone by

I never been much for occasions
But you never let another birthday go by
Without announcing how much you love me
But the truth was always there, right there in your eyes

And were still holding hands when were walkin'
Actin' like we've only just met
But how could that be when there's so much history
I guess that's how true lovers can get

Another year has gone by
And I'm still the one by your side
After everything that's gone by

Celine Dion,"Don't get so busy that you miss
Giving just a little kiss
To the ones you love
Don't even wait a little while
To give them just a little smile
A little is enough

How many people are crying
People are dying
How many people are asking for love

So don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find a way
To give a little love everyday
Don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find your way
'Cause holidays have come and gone
But love lives on
If you give on
Love

How could you wait another minute
A hug is warmer when you're in it
And baby that's a fact
And saying I love you's always better
Seasons, reasons, they don't matter
So don't hold back

How many people in this world
So needful in this world
How many people are praying for love

So don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find a way
To give a little love everyday
Don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find your way
'Cause holidays have come and gone
But love lives on
If you give on
Love

Let all the children know
Everywhere that they go
Their whole life long
Let them know love

Don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find your way
To give a little love everyday
Don't save it all for Christmas Day, hey hey

You have everything and you're still lonely

People smile as they are passing
Christmas time is here, our waiting is done
Wishing it could last forever
Not just twelve days in December

Through the year let's try to remember
That special way
That everyone feels

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees

O hear the angel voices

O night when Christ was born

And in His Name, all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise his holy name

Celine Dion,"I've looked everywhere I can
Just to find a clue
Oh to get to you
And make you want me
And I've run circles around the sun
Chasin' after you
Oh but it's no use
Can't you see that I'm going out of my mind
Trying to find a way to get through to you
Oh you don't know how hard I try
And I try and I try
What do I gotta do

Do I gotta get water from the moon
What do I gotta do 
To make you love me
Do I gotta turn the sand into the sea
Is that what you want from me
I've done everything that I can do
But get water from the moon

I've reached high up in the sky
Tryin' to steal the stars
Oh to win your heart
But even that's not enough
And I've searched every book I know
Just to find the words
Oh to touch your world and get some love out of you
I've already given all I can give
And I don't know what's left to try
And I try and I try
What do I gotta do

Do I gotta get water from the moon, 

Love me, how do I make you love me
How do I make you see that I'm going out of my mind

I try, and I try, and I try

Do I gotta get water from the moon
What do I gotta do 
To make you love me
Do I gotta turn the sand into the sea
Is that what you want from me
I've done everything that I can do
But get water from the moon",Water from the Moon
Celine Dion,"I thought I knew you
Thought that I knew you well
We had a rhythm
But I guess you never can tell

Oh I learned early
Never to ignore the signs
You'll be forgiven
It ain't worth that much to my mind

Lovin' you  so easy
It's hard to say goodbye
But if it's the way it goes it goes

Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
One more lover that used to be
If you think you're in my head
You been seriously misled

Loving somebody ain't your average nine to five
It takes conviction it takes a will to survive
I'm not somebody who commits the crime
And leaves the scene
But when I've been dissed
I don't spend much time on what might've been
I'm not about self-pity
Your love did me wrong
So I'm movin', movin' on

Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
One more lover that used to be
If you think you're in my head
You been seriously misled",Misled
Celine Dion,"Deep within each heart
There lies a magic spark
That lights the fire of our imagination
And since the dawn of man
The strength of just ""I can""
Has brought together people of all nations

There's nothing ordinary
In the living of each day
There's a special part
Every one of us will play

Feel the flame forever burn
Teaching lessons we must learn
To bring us closer to the power of the dream
As the world gives us its best
To stand apart from all the rest
It is the power of the dream that brings us here

Your mind will take you far
The rest is just pure heart
You'll find your fate is all your own creation
And every boy and girl
As they come into this world
They bring the gift of hope and inspiration

Feel the flame forever burn
Teaching lessons we must learn
To bring us closer to the power of the dream
The world in lights and hope and peace
We'll pray that you will always be
It is the power of the dream that brings us here

There's so much strength in all of us
Every woman child and man
It's the moment that you think you can't
You'll discover that you can

Feel the flame forever burn
Teaching lessons we must learn
(To bring us closer to) the power of the dream
The world in lights and hope and peace
(We'll pray that) it will always be
It is the power of the dream that brings us here

That my body froze in bed 
If I just listened to it 
Right outside the window 

There were days when the sun was so cruel 
That all the tears turned to dust 
And I just knew my eyes were 
Drying up forever 

I finished crying in the instant that you left 
And I can't remember where or when or how 
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made 

But when you touch me like this 
And you hold me like that 
I just have to admit 
That it's all coming back to me

There were those empty threats and hollow lies 
And whenever you tried to hurt me 
I just hurt you even worse 
And so much deeper 

There were hours that just went on for days 
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances 
That were lost to us forever 

But you were history with the slamming of the door 
And I made myself so strong again somehow 
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then 

But if I touch you like this 
And if you kiss me like that 
It was so long ago 
But it's all coming back to me 

If you touch me like this

Will he think me weak if I tremble when I speak?

Life can be so cruel, I don't know what to do

I've been there with my heart out in my hand

You can't let the chance to love him pass you by

Tell him, tell him that the sun and moon rise in his eyes
Reach out to him
And whisper tender words so soft and sweet
I'll hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

Touch him with the gentleness you feel inside, I feel it
Your love can't be denied, the truth will set you free
You'll have what's meant to be, all in time you'll see

Ooh, I love him, then show him
Of that much I can be sure, hold him close to you
I don't think I could endure if I let him walk away
When I have so much to say

Tell him, tell him that the sun and moon rise in his eyes
Reach out to him
And whisper tender words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

Love is light that surely glows
In the hearts of those who know
It's a steady flame that grows

Feed the fire with all the passion you can show
Tonight love will assume its place
This memory time cannot erase
Your faith will lead love where it has to go

 When you question me for a simple answer
 I don't know what to say, no
 But it's plain to see, if you stick together
 You're gonna find a way, yeah

 So don't surrender 'cause you can win
 In this thing called love

 When you want it the most there's no easy way out
 When you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
 Don't give up on your faith
 Love comes to those who believe it
 And that's the way it is

 When life is empty with no tomorrow
 And loneliness starts to call
 Baby, don't worry, forget your sorrow
 'Cause love's gonna conquer it all, all

 When you want it the most there's no easy way out
 When you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
 Don't give up on your faith
 Love comes to those who believe it
 And that's the way it is

 When you want it the most there's no easy way out

Celine Dion,"For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right

For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful, baby

You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through
Through it all

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me

Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me, ooh, baby

You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach

You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love, I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me

Maybe, I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because
I was loved by you

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me

Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

You were always there for me, the tender wind that carried me
The light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak

Celine Dion,"I would fight not to ever fall too deep 
Never sure that love would grow 
Now at night as I lay me down to sleep 
I could never let you go 

And lying here with you  I still can't 
Believe it's true 
Never thought that I would ever find a 
Love 

That lasts forever 
Be the man that's mine 
Find the love that never goes away 
Be the heart I know will be 

The one that beats for me  be the man 
Used to be scared if I would ever get 
This close 
I'm not afraid to touch you now 

Long before I knew, I'd be making love 
To you 
I dreamed that maybe I would one day 
Lose myself in someone, someday 

Be the man that's mine 
I always try to find the love that never 
Goes away 
Be the heart I know will be 

The one that beats for me, be the man 
Take me where I have never been 
I will follow you, you'll never be alone 
I will run, run to you 
I never thought that I would ever find a 
Love 
That lasts forever 

Be the man that's mine 
I always try to find the love that never 
Goes away 
Tell me we will always be together 

Make us stay in love this way forever 
Be the heart I know will be 
The one that beats for me 
Wherever you may be 

Always be with me, be the man",Be the Man (On This Night)
Celine Dion,"(Bryan Adams, Elliott Kennedy, Jean-Jacques Goldman)
Everywhere I go all the places that I've been
Every smile is a new horizon on a land I've never seen
There are people around the world - different faces different names
But there's one true emotion that reminds me we're the same...
Lets talk about love

From the laughter of a child to the tears of a grown man
There's a thread that runs right through us all and helps us understand
As subtle as a breeze - that fans a flicker to a flame
From the very first sweet melody to the very last refrain...

Lets talk about love
Lets talk about us
Lets talk about life
Lets talk about trust
Lets talk about love

It's the king of all who live and the queen of good hearts
It's the ace you may keep up your sleeve - ¡®til the name is all but lost
As deep as any sea - with the rage of any storm
But as gentle as a falling leaf on any autumn morn...

Lets talk about love - it's all were needin'
Lets talk about us - it's the air we're breathin'
Lets talk about life - I want to know you
Lets talk about trust - and I want to show you
Lets talk about love",Let's Talk About Love

A thrill that I have never known

Another night away from you
You're the reason I go on

From this fear I will break free
And I'll live again with love
And no they can't take that away from me
And they will see

A very strange enchanted boy.
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea,

And while we spoke of many things,
Fools and kings,
This he said to me,
""The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return.""

Where there was pain now there's joy
Where there was weakness, I found my strength

Then I'm sorry for not giving you enough

But I'm not sorry for my love
I'm not sorry for my touch
The way I made your hands
Tremble and my heart rush

I would do it all again
Wouldn't take back a thing, no
'Cause with you I've lived
A thousand lives in one

And I could never be
I could never be
Sorry for love

Well, maybe there've been times
That I let you down
Looking back on all those moments
I know that I should have found

The best of me for you
And now I will promise to
And if you don't see that in my eyes
Then I'll be
Sorry for the rest of my life

But I'm not sorry for my love
I'm not sorry for my touch
The way I made your hands
Tremble and my heart rush

I would do it all again
Wouldn't take back a thing, no
Cause with you I've lived
A thousand lives in one

But I could never be
I could never be
Sorry for love

Aren't we all make mistakes
No matter how hard we try
But hearts can only break
When sorry comes all around

Oh, when sorry comes around

I'm not sorry
For my love
For my touch

I would do it all again
I wouldn't take back my love

Because with you I've lived
A thousand lives into one
But I could never be
I could never be
I could never be
I could never be

And all that I can do is pray, and pray

We were lost in time
Everything I needed
I feel in your eyes
Always thought of keeping
Your heart next to mine
But now that seems so far away
Don't know how love could leave
Without a trace
Where do silent hearts go?

Where does my heart beat now
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night
Where does my heart beat now
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go

Candle in the water
Drifting helplessly
Hiding from the thunder
Come and rescue me
Driven by hunger
Of the endless dream

I'm searching for the hand that I can hold
I'm reaching for the arms that let me know
Where do silent hearts go?

Where does my heart beat now
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night
Where does my heart beat now
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go
Where do all the lonely hearts go

Then one touch overcomes the silence
Love still survives
Two hearts needing one another
Give me wings to fly

Where does my heart beat now
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night
Where does my heart beat now
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside

I've got someone to give my heart to
Feel it getting stronger and stronger
And stronger
And I feel inside

Celine Dion,"Des milliers de baisers, des milliers de milliers
Un à un de mes lèvres à tes lèvres déposés
Des millions de secondes, instantanés de bonheur
Effacés, disparus en un battement de cœur

Des milliers de mots doux sur des pare-brises envolés
Numéros composés sans jamais oser parler
Bouts d'aveux déchirés dans des corbeilles à papier
Les défroisser, les recoller, lire et les garder

Des milliers de caresses au millimètre carré
Des milliers de cris, de souffles à nos bouches échappés
Dans de ciels effleurés, touchés, sommeils emmêlés
Rayés comme si tout ça n'avait jamais été

Je voudrais tout ramasser dans des grands sacs poubelle
Les paroles oubliées, des plus banales aux plus belles
Qu'aucun ne se perde de ces instants si précieux
Ces phrases ont été dites, ces moments ont eu lieu

Tout enregistrer, ajouter le son les odeurs
ADN, empreintes, mais que jamais rien ne meure
Ces millions de films de nous, mais pas du cinéma
Toutes les scènes perdues que l'on ne jouait pas

On ouvrirait tous les jours où nous serions moins forts
Tous ces embryons d'amour, toutes ces aurores
Sincères, démasqués, fragiles et vrais de candeur
Nous revoir ainsi nous rendrait peut-être meilleurs

Des milliers de baisers, des milliers de milliers
Un à un de nos lèvres sur des peaux déposées
Des milliers de pensées, de moments d'éternité
De regards échangés dans des gares, échangés
Des milliers de baisers en un clin d'œil oubliés",Des Milliers de Baisers

Que la terre est si belle et le ciel est si grand
Qu'il est beau, que je l'aime, qu'il est ma vie, ma joie
Qu'il est un parmi des millions d'humains

Le bien, le mal et même le bonheur
Qu'il ne perde jamais ses yeux d'enfant

Je lui dirai les chansons, les poèmes
Qu'il n'y a pas d'amour sans histoire
Que le bonheur est un grain que l'on sème
Qu'amour et santé ne s'achètent pas
Et qu'on n'est riche que de ça

Je lui dirai qu'un jour une autre femme
Viendra l'aimer et qu'il l'aimera
Que j'en mourrai de bonheur et de larmes
Mais que nous serons là pas après pas
Que c'est la vie et sa loi

C'est mon homme, mon drapeau
Mon homme, celui qu'il me faut
Je frissonne, je prends l'eau
C'est mon homme, mon abri, mon lit, mon héros

Il ne saurait pas comment briller
Ou comme un phare banal, oublié
Dans sa mer ordinaire
Il brise les vagues sans voir
Ces milliers de lumières
Qu'il m'offre sans le vouloir

C'est mon homme, mon drapeau
Mon homme, celui qu'il me faut
Je frissonne, je prends l'eau
C'est mon homme, mon feu, mon repos

Then it hits you with no chance to hide

But don't you miss out on the way

Just throw in everything you've got 
'Cause in love there's no holding back

Tell me that you played it safe
'Cause you're afraid to hurt your neck

Never knowing what you get

Want to date the best in me
Giving up the greatest trash,
Who knows what it turns out to be

Dreaming you will find me

And every brand new morning
You're the sun that's dawning
And I love that landslide
Feels so good I want to cry

Never felt this way before
In your hands I'm free to fall
Show what's underneath it all
The way you make me feel

Reveal

What we do in privacy
Make a woman out of me
When you're close it feels so right
You and I reveal tonight

Celine Dion,"Forgive me for the things
That I never said to you
Forgive me for not knowing
The right words to say, to prove 

That I will always be
Devoted to you and me
And if you can't feel that in my love
Then I'm sorry for not giving you enough

But I'm not sorry for my love
I'm not sorry for my touch
The way I made your hands
Tremble and my heart rush

I would do it all again
Wouldn't take back a thing, no
'Cause with you I've lived
A thousand lives in one

And I could never be
I could never be
Sorry for love

Well, maybe there've been times
That I let you down
Looking back on all those moments
I know that I should have found

The best of me for you
And now I will promise to
And if you don't see that in my eyes
Then I'll be
Sorry for the rest of my life

But I'm not sorry for my love
I'm not sorry for my touch
The way I made your hands

I would do it all again
Wouldn't take back a thing, no
Cause with you I've lived
A thousand lives in one

But I could never be
I could never be
Sorry for love

Aren't we all make mistakes
No matter how hard we try
But hearts can only break
When sorry comes all around

OOh, when sorry comes around

I'm not sorry...
For my love
For my touch

I would do it all again
I wouldn't take back my love

Celine Dion,"I cry and you comfort me
I'm lost and you hear my scream
So it's hard to watch you falling
When you run so deep in me
You live in me

Gonna stand by your side now
Let me kiss all your tears away
You can stay in my arms now
And I know I can make you believe again

I walk but you can run through fire
I search for reasons and baby you inspire
But I know somebody hurt you
And I know you really need a friend
Well you can take my hand

Gonna stand by your side now
Let me kiss all your tears away
You can stay in my arms now
And I know I can make you believe again

So when you're feeling like you can't go on
Don't you know
You never walk alone no
And you live in me

Gonna stand by your side now
Let me kiss all your tears away
You can stay in my arms now
And I know I can make you believe again

I'm gonna stand, stand by your side
Kiss all your tears away tonight

My lonely days are over, and life is like a song
Oh yeah yeah at last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover, the night I looked at you

I found a dream, that I can speak to
A dream that I, can call my own
I found a thrill, to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known
Oh yeah you smiled you smiled oh and then the spell was cast
And here we are, in Heaven
For you are mine at last at last
At last oh yes",At Last [Live]

For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful baby
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through through it all

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

Celine Dion,"Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago, that's right

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, ""Julie, baby, you're my flame""

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said, ""Oh Daddy, don't you dare""

He gives me fever when he kisses me
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses
""Oh daddy, won't you treat him right""

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade

They give you fever when you kiss them

Was a little nappy headed boy 
Then my only worry 
Was for Christmas what would be my toy

Would not get a thing 
We were happy with the 
Joy the day would bring 
Sneaking out the back door 
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine 
Greeted at the back door 
But thought I told you not to go outside 
Tryin' your best to bring the 
Water to your eyes

Why did those days ever have to go

'Bout you playin' doctor with that girl 
Just don't tell I'll give you 
Anything you want in this whole wide world 
Mama gives you money for Sunday school 
You trade yours for candy after church is through 
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (you nasty boy) 
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the wall 
You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right 
But while you were doin'it-it sure felt outta sight

I'm sittin' on a rainbow
Got a string around my finger

I can make the rain go
Any time I move my finger
Look at me, can't you see, I'm in love?

Life is a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let you go

I've got the world on a string

Celine Dion,"There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed if I just listened to it right outside the window

There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever

I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me

When I touch you like this and I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe but it's all coming back to me

(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow, baby Baby

If I kiss you like this and if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago but it's all coming back to me

If you want me like this and if you need me like that
It was dead long ago but it's all coming back to me

It's so hard to resist and it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now",It's All Coming Back to Me Now [Live]

If I could travel across the world
The secrets I would tell

You and I were meant to fly
Higher than the clouds
We'll sail across the sky
So come with me, and you will feel
That we're soaring, that we're floating off so high

Je devrais me faire une raison

Every night, he takes me dancing 
In very, very cheerful places 
Where he has lots of friends 
Yes, I know, he likes boys 
I should reason myself 
Trying to forget him, but
Ziggy, il s'appelle Ziggy
Je suis folle de lui
C'est un garçon pas comme les autres
Et moi je l'aime, c'est pas d'ma faute
Même si je sais
Qu'il ne m'aimera jamais

It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt it's worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees

O hear the angel voices
O night divine!
O night when Christ was born
O night divine!
O night, oh night divine!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains He shall break, for the slave is our brother.

And in His Name, all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise his holy name
Christ is the Lord!
Their name forever praise we

I finished crying in the instant that you left 
And I can't remember where or when or how 
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

The life I meant to lead
Won't slip away from me.

[Chorus]
'Cause this time is the last time
I know that my eyes
Have seen to much
This nightmare is not fair
And I've had enough
You break me 'cause I bleed
You just say you're sorry
You call this love
But this time
Your lies are not enough
This time.

There's nothing left of this
You whispered words and empty threats
We both wait to see
What I thought this would be
The last thread has come undone
To reveal what I've become
Another victim of
A poison love

I've been afraid for years
But that won't keep me here.

[Chorus]

What remains a mystery
You can not have the best of me
So I'm taking back all you took from me.

Celine Dion,"I've seen the tears and the heartache, and I felt the pain
I've seen the hatred in so many lives, and lost in vain
And yet through this darkness there's always a light that shines through
And takes me back home
Takes me back home

All of the promises broken
And all of the songs left unsung
Seems so far away as I make my way back to you

[Chorus:]
You gave me faith and you gave me a world to believe in
You gave me your love to believe in
And feeling this love I can rise up above
And be strong and be whole once again

I know that dreams we hold on to, can just fade away
And I know that words can be wasted, with so much to say
And I when I feel helpless there's always a hope that shines through
And makes me believe
Makes me believe



And I see for one fleeting moment
A paradise under the sun
I drift away and I make my way back to you

[Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Life goes on
Can leave all sweet sorrow and pain
And life, hold on
To all that you are
To all that we'll be
And I can go on once again

Because your love hears my soul once again
I can live and I can dream once again
Because you made me love you",A World to Believe In

I keep the memory of you and me 
Inside

Fulfill your destiny
Is there within the child
My storm will never end
My fate is on the wind
The king of hearts, the joker's wild
We don't say goodbye
We don't say goodbye
I'll make them all remember me

'Cause I have found a dream that must come true
Every ounce of me must see it through
But you are my only
I'm sorry I don't have a role for love to play
Hand over my heart I'll find my way
I will make them give to me

Immortality
There is a vision and a fire in me
I keep the memory of you and me, inside
And we don't say goodbye
We don't say goodbye

With all my love for you
And what else we may do
We don't say, goodbye",Immortality [From Saturday Night Fever]
Celine Dion,"The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling like thunder now
As I look in your eyes

I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear
Suddenly the feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

'Cause I'm your lady And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love",Power off Love
Celine Dion,"I knew I loved you, before I knew you
The hands of time would lead me to you
An evening star, watched from afar
It guided me here, It knew you'd be here

Now wrapped in moonlight, at last together
Here in the incandescent glow, we are all we need to know
As we softly please each other 'til the stars and shadows glow
And we sing with our dreams among us

It guided me here, It knew you'd be here

I knew I loved you, before I found you
And you had built my world around you
Now all my days, they're now my nights
And my tomorrows will all begin and end, with you",I Knew I Loved You
Celine Dion,"My love, we have seen it all
The Endless confession,The rise and fall
As fragile as a child
Lately I'm sorry I can't hold a smile

But I stand tall to get by
No matter how hard I try to hide
Did you know I take the time for you
Did you know that I would see you through
Did you know that I would play the part
I must've made it clear right from the start

My love, can you give me strength
Somehow I forgot how to ease my pain
I know I'm right where I belong
Something from nothing never proved me wrong

But I stand tall to get by
No matter how hard I try to hide
Did you know I take the time for you

Did you know that I would see you through
Did you know that I would play the part
I must've made it clear right from the start

I would shade my whole life with you
Would you do the same for me
I would give all I am to you
Would you do the same for me

And I will stand tall to get by
No matter how hard I try to hide
Could you see I've been brave
Did you notice all my mistakes
There were times I could feel you read my mind

Did you know I take the time for you
Did you know that I would see you through
Did you know that I would play the part
I know I made it clear right from the start",My Love [Live]

I'll be the one to hold you
Let me be your soldier
I'll fight the fight for you
When you're up against the wall
I will pull you through

There comes a time
In everybody's life
When alone is not enough

Celine Dion,"I know that once in love
You don't think of the devil who's inside
And maybe it will come one day
When you'll feel safe and I won't have the time

You hear what you wanna hear
Blink once I could disappear
Some rules to the game of me
Get it right for both of us

Just say what you wanna say
I've got it to give away
We both want to make it last
So keep your eyes on me, your eyes on me

It's not an illusion that you're the one
And I have fallen deep
I said it from the start, when we're apart
You must only think of me

Temptation is all around
Take good care of what you found
That's why when I turn around
You better keep

You better keep your eyes on me
No matter what you think I need
No matter what you once believed
If you're mine, so you better say

No matter what you think I need
No, it doesn't really matter what you once believed
I wanna be the air you breathe
Yeah, you better be everything you said you'd be

I've gotta be your only one or we can't go on
No matter what you think I need
You better keep your eyes on me

And say that you want me
Open up your heart even if it's hard
Say that you need me
Better let him know, baby don't put on a show

You say that you need me
Tell him how you feel, let him know it's real
And if you love me
Never turn your back, gonna keep my eyes on us

Temptation is all around
Take good care of what you found
That's why when I turn around

Celine Dion,"I learned from the past
Not everything lasts
I understand that now
Everything changed
When you walked away
But I'll survive somehow
Though I have regrets
I'll learn to forget
And just keep moving on
Cause when love is gone
You have to be strong
Once touched by pain
You're not the same
But time can heal
Your heart again
So let the clouds
That bring you down
Just fade away
Away

So I try to smile
But after a while
The memories come back
But I won't give in
Cause I know that then
My heart will fade to black

And this time I learned
That love can burn
It's an all consuming flame
There's no right or wrong

I've got to be strong

Once touched by pain
You're not the same
But time can heal
Your heart again
So let the clouds
That bring you down
Just fade away
Away

I know that one day I'll find that feeling again
But until I do I'll do fine by myself

Once touched by pain
You're not the same
But time can heal
Your heart again
So let the clouds
That bring you down
You know that

Once touched by pain
You're not the same
But time can heal
Your heart again
So let the clouds
That bring you down
So let the clouds
That bring you down
Just fade away
Away",Fade Away
Celine Dion,"When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold

When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood’s run stale

I want to hide the truth
I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside
There’s nowhere we can hide

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

When the curtain’s call
Is the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl

So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you made

Don’t want to let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don’t want to hide the truth

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go

Your eyes, they shine so bright
I want to save their light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide",Soul Medley: Sex Machine/ Soul Man/ Lady Marmalade/ Sir Duke/ Respect/

Ces yeux qui se ferment par instants 
Ces pensées qui nous séparent

Peines muettes ou courses d'enfant 
Bouts de vie que tu caches 
À l'abri dans ton silence 
Que brise ma voix, je le sens

Souffler comme le vent 
Sur ton doux visage 
Faire partir le noir, disparaître le temps 
Casser les nuages 
Parler même tout bas

De petits riens 
Mais là-bas 

Au loin, tu nages 

Tu nages sans t'arrêter 
Dans les eaux profondes, quelque part 
Tu nages pour ne pas couler 
Et ici-bas, c'est déjà le soir

Celine Dion,"I listen to my heartbeat and I
Try to follow where it leads me, that's right.
I don't wake up in the shadows anymore.
I can finally breathe

I dig a little deep down searching
Took a little time to work it through
But I found everything
The day that I had you

I once was the lost one
Like a wayward child
Now you're the light that leads the way

I can melt the drops of freezing rain
I'll fly in and save the day
I will always try to make it
Better than it was for me

You'll always be the first one in my prayers
Just close your eyes and I am there
It's a better world
Since you're my boy I'll always be your girl

I'm picking up all the pieces
When I put 'em back together I'm like new
'Cause my greatest wish
Has already come true

We'll always be connected baby
Like a button to a sleeve
And this lullaby
Will send you off to sleep

It's hard to imagine
My life before you
'Cause you're the light that leads the way

I can melt the drops of freezing rain
I'll fly in and save the day
I will always try to make it
Better than it was for me

You'll always be the first one in my prayers
Just close your eyes and I am there
It's a better world
Since you're my boy I'll always be your girl

I'll be holding the wrap if you come on and fall
There is love after love after all

We'll always be connected baby
You're like a button on my sleeve
And this lullaby, oh

I can melt the drops of freezing rain
I'll fly in and save the day
I will always try to make it
Better than it was for me

You'll always be the first one in my prayers
Just close your eyes and I am there
It's a better world
Since you're my boy I'll always be your girl
Your girl",Always Be Your Girl
Celine Dion,"I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear-skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired

The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say ""Come dance with me""
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems at seventeen

A brown eyed girl in hand-me-downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, ""Pity, please, the ones who serve
They only get what they deserve.
The rich relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly""

So remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality
And dubious integrity
The small town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received at seventeen

To those of us who knew the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
When dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly ducking girls like me

We all play the game and when we dare
We cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
That call and say, ""Come dance with me""
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me at seventeen",At Seventeen
Celine Dion,"From the fire in your words
To the dagger in your eye
I just have to lay my body down
Go and lay my body down
I pretend to be asleep
But I know you hear me cry
I just have to lay my body down
Go and lay my body down

But if I
Really want a change
Then I must admit
That I'm the one to blame

If I could break away
Cut the cord
For worse or better
If I could turn the page
At last and say
Goodbye forever
But on the other side
Of yesterday
Beyond the heartache
What if all I am
Without the pain
Is empty hearted
I could break away

Is it true what people say
That it's darkest before dawn?
I just have to lay my body down
Go and lay my body down
Any hope we might have saved
Is too weak to let live on
I just have to lay my body down
Go and lay my body down

And if I
Really want a change
Then tonight I'm gonna need
All of my strength

If I could break away
Cut the cord
For worse or better
If I could turn the page
At last and say
Goodbye forever
But on the other side
Of yesterday
Beyond the heartache
What if all I am
Without the pain
Is empty hearted
I could break away

Oh, anything is better than this
I know
Anything is better

If I could break away
Cut the cord
For worse or better
If I could turn the page
At last and say
Goodbye forever
But on the other side
Of yesterday
Beyond the heartache
What if all I am
Without the pain
Is empty hearted

If I could break away
If I could turn the page
But on the other side
Of yesterday
Beyond the heartache
What if all I am
Without the pain
Is empty hearted
I could break away",Breakaway
Celine Dion,"I thought I had it long ago,
I held on, but It let go.
It kissed me on a subway train
And I melted

It got my hand it brushed my cheek,
It moved right in, it cut me deep.
You know it even had a name,
I really felt it.

I didn't know love,
Not even close,
This is more beautiful and frightening than I've ever known,
It's making me weak,
Making me strong,
It's making me afraid I'm gonna wake up
And find it gone,
I didn't know love.

It's a blessing, it's a curse.
You know you've found it when it hurts.
It can drive you off a cliff,
But it's worth it.

Careful where you spend the night,
It's complicated when it's right.
You can make me such a mess,
Yeah you're perfect!

But I didn't know love,
Not even close,
This is more beautiful and frightening than I've ever know,
It's making me weak,
Making me strong,
It's making me afraid I'm gonna wake up
And find you gone,
I didn't know love.
No, I didn't know love.

Now you're lying in my arms, beside me.
In the past I'd settled for a touch,
I'd tell myself it was enough,
I was lying, lying, lying.
'Cause I didn't know love

I didn't know love,
Not even close,
This is more beautiful and frightening than I've ever known.
It's making me weak,
Making me strong
It's making me afraid I'm gonna wake up and find you gone.

No, I didn't know love,

Celine Dion,"Over time, I've been building my castle of love
Just for two, though you never
Knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you now to say
That I've got to throw my castle away

Over dreams,
I have picked out a perfect come true
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come
From too far away
For you to say come back some other day

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully
Turned every stone
Just to find,
I had found what I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me now to find
The love that I sought can never be mine

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

And though the odds say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you will find
You too like I
Overjoyed, over loved, over you, over you",Overjoyed

Lay me down to never wake
I look up and I see you
So with everything I am

Escape from pouring rain
Running to the alleyways

After chasing ghosts and fairy tales
I'm right where I belong

And I don't care where you have been before

But I'm thankful to be here
Thankful to feel clear
Thankful my prayers have been answered
I'm thankful you listened
Thankful to heaven
Thankful for feeling alive again
Thankful that hearts always mend

I write it all on paper dolls
Let them play their little games
Of who loves who and what is true
No one ever takes the blame

I see you through the window
And it takes my breath away
But I lose the floor beneath me
And all that's left to say

As I don't know where I was going
And I don't care where we have been before

But I'm thankful to be here
Thankful to feel clear
Thankful my prayers have been answered
I'm thankful you listened

It's been nearly an hour,
Since I thought of you.

I'd settle for a busy tone,
At least by that I'd know that you're okay.

Now you're gone,

I need a drink to get me out.
A couple more til I forget your name.

I saw a guy that looked like you,
I did not know quite what to do,
It took a power of will to break my stare.
I realized what I wanted wasn't there.

Now you're gone,

J'ai supplié:
""Laissez-le moi!""
Mais ils sont venus te chercher
Je n'ai que toi au monde
Pour me parler d'amour
Que toi qui me répondes
Quand j'appelle au secours
Je n'ai que toi au monde
Que toi à qui confier
Mes blessures profondes
Et mes rêves brisés
Je n'ai que toi au monde
Et si je te perdais
Je crois que j'en mourrais
Tu sais
Tu t'en allais
Porter la paix
À un peuple en détresse
Sans hésiter
Tu étais prêt
À donner ta jeunesse
Tu étais beau
Comme un héros
Sur ta dernière photo
Je n'ai que toi au monde
Pour me parler d'amour
Que toi qui me répondes
Quand j'appelle au secours
Je n'ai que toi au monde
Reviendras-tu vivant
De cette guerre immonde
Vivant mais comme avant?
Je n'ai que toi au monde
Et si je te perdais
Je crois que j'en mourrais
Tu sais
Je n'ai que toi au monde
Mais qu'est-ce que t'as fait
De tes deux bras
Qui ne pourront plus me serrer?
Je n'ai que toi au monde
À qui parler d'amour
Que toi qui me répondes
Quand j'appelle au secours
Je n'ai que toi au monde
Et si je te perdais
Je crois que j'en mourrais
Tu sais
Je n'ai que toi au monde
Que toi au monde",Que Toi au Monde (En Cours)
Celine Dion,"When I was a little girl
I had a rag doll
Only doll I had ever owned
Now I love you just the way I loved that rag doll
But only now my love has grown

And it gets stronger, in every way
And it gets deeper, let me say
And it gets higher, day by day

And do I love you my oh my
Yes river deep mountain high
If I lost you would I cry
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby

When you were a young boy
Did you have a puppy
That always followed you around
Well I am going to be as faithful as that puppy
No I will never let you down

Because it grows stronger, like a river flows
And it gets bigger baby, and heaven knows
And it gets sweeter baby, as it grows

And do I love you my oh my
Yes river deep mountain high
If I lost you would I cry
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby

I love you baby like a flower loves the spring
And I love you baby just like Tina loves to sing
And I love you baby like a school boy loves his pet
And I love you baby, river deep mountain high
Oh yeah you have got to believe me

Do I love you my oh my, oh baby

Au cadran de l'absence
Tant de temps
Déluge de silence

La nuit tombe sur nous

Tant de temps
Comme une marée noire
Qui s'étend
Sur l'eau de ma mémoire
Sous la proue
D'un amour qui s'échoue

Oh, ma vie
Pourquoi suis-je tombé de haut
Sur le banc des gens normaux
Dans mes mains
Y'a plus rien
Que du pain pour les oiseaux

Tant de temps
À respirer tes lettres
Ces instants
Qui ne peuvent pas renaître
Dans nos yeux
Qui ne croient plus en nous deux

Tant de temps
Qui me ronge les ongles
Jusqu'au sang
À blanchir ton ombre
J'ai si peur
Des fantômes du bonheur

Toutes ces nuits
À survivre loin de toi
Dans le vide de tes bras
Accroché à l'amour
Sous l'avalanche des jours

Celine Dion,"If ever a boy stood on the moon
All the heavens would call them angels 'round
Stop the tears from troubled sky's, from 
Falling, falling, falling.

If ever the river could whisper your name,
Would the choices you made still be the same?
Like a flower that dies from angry rain,
Why do we hurt ourselves?

Where is the love that lets the sunlight in to start again?
The love that sees no color lines?
Life begins with love,
So spread your wings and fly,
Guide your spirit safe and sheltered,
A thousand dreams that we can still believe.

If ever a boy stood on the moon,
Carrying all of his treasures from the stars
To a rainbow which leads to where we are.
Together we'd chase the sun.

Where is the love that lifts my brother's voice to the skies?
The love that answers a mother's cry?
Life begins with love,
So spread your wings and fly,
Guide your spirit safe and sheltered.
A thousand dreams that we can still believe.

A boy stood on the moon
The ancient souls can still discover
A thousand dreams that we can still believe
That we can still believe
We can still believe
We can still believe",Where Is the Love?
Celine Dion,"À la claire fontaine, m'en allant promener

[ CHORUS: U.G. ]
Aiyo, get nice
Shoot dice
Skip the small talk
Son, advance to BOARDWALK
Collectin properties and profit
Expand and make dough
Yo, slide past GO

[ Phantasm ]
Check the drama as the saga starts to enfold
To advance and pass GO and get the pot of gold
In the MEDITERRANEAN
Met this fly lady, and
She had two lovers
The rich Parker Brothers
On the run from the IRS for INCOME TAX
After this heist, son, we sittin on stacks
In this new community lookin for the Treasure Chest
Took a wrong left turn, fuck it yo, nevertheless
It's my fault, kid
We ended up on BALTIC
Off course
But still we ain't takin a loss
There he go, READING at the RAILROAD in his Porsche
Waitin for his brother to come in on the iron horse

[ U.G. ]
Can it be so simple?
Playin in my rental on ORIENTAL
AVENUE passin through CONNECTICUT
Got to get the burn mark just to VISIT Matt Life in the clink (/JAIL)
I'm bagged for stolen minks and snatchin links
[ Phantasm ]
At ST. CHARLES PLACE
Let me check Digga and Masta Ase
And the Inc.
They own ELECTRIC COMPANY
Next is the state of VIRGINIA, with Rhamadan
And got Mad Skillz like Shaqwan
At the train station
We waitin
For my PENNSYLVANIA connect
To come through and show us love and respect
Don't even take aim, cause he's a SAINT like JAMES
And when you're done with the body burn em in the flames

[ U.G. }
Sippin Hennessy on TENNESSEE
With Hav and P
Seen Schott Free, asked me to walk to NEW YORK
AVENUE, bag two chicks who whips were stashed at FREE PARKING
We seen Lou Diamond with Tony Starks, then
Some kid tried to buck me
On KENTUCKY
Some gang named CHANCE wore bandanas
So I ran to INDIANA
(ILLINOIS/) ILLA NOYZ and his boys
Held me down and got my back
Pass the gat, yes, I'm just cool like that

It's after three, yo
We at B&0
Amtrak and MARVIN GARDENS
A player like Phantasm is starvin
Check the fountain and see if the WATER WORKS
While I send four

[ U.G. ]
I was on ATLANTIC
With my man Quick
To snatch jewels and hit the scale
Seen 50, didn't want to GO TO JAIL
On PENNSYLVANIA
I met Lorena
She had on Guess
She said (you need a vest
goin through COMMUNITY CHEST)
Or NC, NORTH CAROLINA if you visit
You look exquisite
????? made by PACIFIC
Kicked a SHORT LINE
Shorty was mine
She was with it
I got the digits
But never got the CHANCE to hit it

[ Phantasm ]
At PARK PLACE
Hit the Parker Brothers' safe
And made a killin
And skated with about two million
But we got to pay TAX on the LUXURY

[Chorus]
Perfect combination
Ain't no other relationship
Like this
I know we're gonna last forever

At the edge of my bed I sit back and reminisce
Long talks and walks and also your soft kiss
We went shopping at Macy's, skating at Lacey's
Cut off all my dime pieces, even thick Stacey
Thinkin' in this rental blastin' instrumentals
How we first met was all on my mental
It was at Great Adventure, the 'Batman Ride'
Thought I was deaded 'cause first this fat man tried
The sun, beamin', federation schemin'
But you was clockin' DiBiase, musta been day-dreamin'
Waitin' on line, wishin' she was all mine
Shootin' the gift, exchanged digits, the whole nine
Spent about 850 in Atlantic City
After you, boo, my attitude is real sh

Scenery sunny, act one, near a money machine
Jumped out the cream Lex with Jacks, she rocked a black tennis skirt
With Stan Smith's, about a size 6
Jewels, chinky eyes, long hair, bow legged, her thighs
Was thick like she ran track, for what it's worth
Shortie was made from the best things on this Earth
Like a Snapple I wanted to drink her to quench my thirst
Jumped in the coupe and threw my joint in reverse
Hey boo, I was watchin' you (I was watchin' you)
Here's my number (true) call me at the crib at 2

[Chorus]

Hey yo, tell me what went wrong to make me write this song
Used to have it going on, our feelings was so strong
Your age 26, my number one draft pick
From all the rest, got first dibs plus your own crib
You just flew back in town (from where, son?) from Dallas
And said she wants the Tall Man to come to her palace
I'm over there tonight to watch the Bulls catch licks
From the Knicks and at halftime I watch Rod Strick's
Get bizzynizm, I feel lucky to shoot the gizm
In her triangular prism, and that's the realism
(Where does she live, kid?) Out in Bed-Stuy
(Do-or-Die?) come on now, baby, 'cause I'm packin'

I got the phone call at 2 (it's me, boo) oh
She said (you know, why don't you come to the crib-o?
We could wine and dine and relax on the low
And drink Mo, by the way, I just saw your video)
Yeah, true, I'm comin' through, give me a hour
Jumped out the shower and buried my body in baby powder
Dipped wears plus my hair smells like Nexus
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) Yo, I jump into the Lexus
On the highway, it's a Friday, can't wait to see her
I picked up two slices from the local pizzeria

[Chorus]

Got to the crib about 8, she told me wait in the living room
Be back real soon, on HBO tonight is ""Platoon""
Laid back in this recliner, sex on my minder
Playin' Pitty Pat watchin' ""Fritz the Cat""

Whip in the drive-way and do want to club, playin' Nas 'One Love'
Drinkin' OE, she told me her address was double 0-3
I slowly walked up the steps and rung her back bell
Talkin' on my cell

I skated to the back, I see Black Knights and smell Fahrenheit
That's when shortie took flight

What's the deal, fam? What's the real plan, shortie flashed
Knockin' over trash like she was runnin' a 40 yard dash
Let's hit the club and start from scratch
'Cause all I wanted us to be was the perfect match

Where frozen breath originates

Celly Cel,"[ VERSE 1 ]
One by one goes the bullets in the clip
Put it in yo gat, one in the chamber, now you're ready to start shit
Heat comin from the barrel with a cloud of smoke
Dead bodies on the ground when these fools get loc'ed
It's crazy in the street, pack some heat for a sucker
Mobbin through the town tryin to murder muthafuckas
211's every day, liquor store and bank jobs
D boys gettin robbed, niggas get jacked for they mobbs
What's a nigga to do, can't survive without a gun
Snitches in the street, a nigga livin on the run
It's fun but the pen is like smokin sess
Locked up on a 187'll make any nigga stress
You can wear a vest, it won't stop two to the head
Shot you in your face and now your ass is better off dead
Talkin shit'll get you smoked quick
No need to save a hoe because they can't live without dick
So I focus on the mail, Celly Cel
Ain't no playa-hatin nigga, I got too much heat to sell
Fairy tales I never kick, it's gangsterism in my veins
I kicked it with the O.G.'s pickin up on game:
Get your money on, fuck a bitch and get ghost
And keep one in the chamber for them fools that play you close
Them Sick Wid' It niggas keep makin the beat 4 yo azz
Ciggedy-Cel the figgedy-funky nigga got some heat 4 yo azz

[ CHORUS (2X) ]
Some heat 4 yo azz
Some heat 4 yo azz
Them Sick Wid' It nigga got the beat 4 yo azz
Some heat 4 yo azz
Some heat 4 yo azz
That nigga Celly Cel got some heat 4 yo azz

[ VERSE 2 ]
Them Sick Wid' It niggas got the beat up comin with some heat
Them federal muthafuckas tryin to get a buck in the streets
Every day a nigga want to test yo skill
And playa-hatas hate to see a nigga comin real
The H-i-double l-s-i-d-e
Down with the P.G., niggas don't want to see me
Act a fuckin fool, shootin up the city
Happy on the trigger like my nigga Frank Nitty
Let's get into the see thang, Hillside slang
It's a Hillside thang from the Hillside, mang
Smokin em like a chronic sack, rollin em in a zag
Hittin em with the funk and zippin em up in bodybags
Everywhere I go fools get to actin crazy
want to let they nuts hang, thinkin they can fade me
So I keep a life-long mug on my face
Rollin with some heat, sippin on a straight lace
A high speed chase, bank it in the side pocket
Po-po's can't fuck with the 350 rocket
Under my hood it's all good when I'm on the gas
Checkin the rollers and the jackers that try to blast
Tricks of the trade already made, gangster got it down
Never panic under pressure when it's goin down
Droppin a bomb, nigga, mobb beats 4 yo azz
Ciggedy-Cel the figgedy-funky nigga got some heat 4 yo azz

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Breakin em off somethin proper for the nine-fo'
In the do' is some of that heat 4 yo azz, hoe
Little hoes and the don't-know's need to know
A nigga that flow who ain't comin out the gate slow
Pimpin and and pandlin, hoe handlin the whole bit
Killers move in silence, nigga, I don't talk shit
I see them loudmouth niggas keep gettin dead
And the silent ones on 25 to life bids
You gotta pack some heat in the street, it's goin down
If you ain't down you better move to a square town
Niggas talk shit, drink and smoke weed up
Hit the county jail straight p.c.-ed up
You never know who really down till the funk jump
Same one that jump and the finger points at the punk
And your crew wasn't down from the get-go
Don't you know how that bitch-made nigga shit go?
Hollow points get to the point quicker
Cause talkin shit full of liquor thinkin that you're sicker
Than the next nigga'll get you full of bullet holes
Stayin on my toes and I just can't let go
Of this mobb shit that I kick 4 yo azz
Ciggedy-Cel the figgedy-funky nigga got some heat 4 yo azz

Choppin it up with the homies, havin visions of a glock 17
Niggas on my team can't wait to fill clip up
We jumpin out the barrel with my niggas, shootin shit up
See under niner ross, black talon, hollow tips flow
Aim me at the chest, I'm makin sure that vest don't get no love
Ain't even breathin, leave the body shittin like a seagull
See I'm illegal, I got pockets like that ? eagle
Fuckin around with me is danger, I'm talkin shit
Tryin to brainwash the trigger when I'm in the chamber
Don't give a fuck if it's a accident or on purpose
When I'm comin out the chamber, fool it's just inservice
Don't get nervous when you see what I do
I love to hit the target, and when I'm breakin that skin, ooh
Travel through his heart, ricochét off the nearest bone
Rip his insides up, shatter his spine, now I'm gone
Layin by the body, waitin for the FEDS
Swoop me up for evidence, then I'm just some melted led
It ain't no thang, got me back where I started
In a box, with my homies, waitin for my next target

Ha ha ha, the mothafuckin bullet
Shootin up shit everywhere
Every city in every state
Don't give a fuck about who when the bullet fly
The only thought that's on my mind is ""die nigga, die""

But what do ya know, looks like I'm 'bout to be purchased again
I seen a nigga ask for them black talons and grin
It won't be long 'til they let me loose
Got me in the clip, drinkin Gin with no fuckin juice
It's goin down, I know they ridin on some fools tonight
Hit the lights, squeeze the trigger, send me on my flight
Don't give a fuck about who I hit when I fly
The only thought that's on my mind is ""die nigga, die""
Women and children and babies, I know it's crazy
See I'm a bullet, it's my job, man that shit don't faze me
Even the hand that's on the trigger get shot too
Wherever the barrel aiming at, that's who I end up smokin fool
Don't get it twisted, I got no love for none of y'all
Got to dig a tunnel through your head, and watch the body fall
Just shoot and I'mma do the rest
I love givin young niggas cardiac arrests
Bullet-proof niggas, I go up in 'em quickly
The ambulance picked him up with shit all in his Dickies
Just cock the glock, put your finger on the trigger, pull it
And make a mothafucka feel the bullet

Ha ha ha, yeah
Another victim of these mothafuckin bullets
Once we pull the trigger, don't get nervous
'cause it's instant mothafuckin service
Ha ha ha, yeah
Breakin fools off every-mothafuckin-day
Ha ha ha

Up out the chamber, it's that sneaky mothafucka creepin
You heard a shot but didn't know until the blood was leakin
Up out your chest, you seen your flesh was a bloody mess
Dropped down on your knees, and ran outta breath
Sentanced to your death
Got hit by the wig splittin, shirt rippin, pistol wippin nigga
Catchin 'em slippin when they set trippin
Dippin and dabbin, you niggas know who I am, and
Can't be fuckin with them faulty heaters that be jammin
I love to fly and when they jam, I can't come out and kick it
Just pick a target, point me at it and see how quick I hit it
Droppin bodies by the dozens, in and out your cousins
I'm burnin niggas like a oven, givin up no lovin
? with my dogs, ridin in a 50 round clip
Ready to make the hit, talkin long shit, bitch
Hit the floor before I hit the door and split ya with some heat
Take your head and leave your body in the street
As I creep, up on my next mothafuckin victim
Sweep him off his feet, pull the trigger, let me sick him
Hit him high, hit him low, you know how it go
Put your finger on the trigger, pull it, the mothafuckin bullet

Ha ha ha, the mothafuckin bullet
Mobbin through your hood and takin head
Showin no mothafuckin remorse
We don't give a fuck about you

In & out the pen, real niggas might ? nice 
Made this hog get the brew

Moms know a nigga kill 
Go to my room, sleep off my high, and hit the door

Boxin' toe to toe & everybody in a circle 
Sockin' mutha-fuckas 'til they eyes turn purple 
Ain't no set trippin', no jumpin', it's just 1 on 1 
Fools throwin' thangs to the end

No gunshots 
No need to hit the floor 
But after shool 
The whole city woken up 
Let's hit the park fool 
To see a little league, a Babe Ruth baseball game 
Niggas was down there cuttin' up or throwin' thangs 
Chasin' 5 off for hot dogs & fries bitch

Got a little older, now the park is a joke 
'Cause all the ball players out there slangin' dope 
Some of my niggas is on grimmies, but I didn't slip 
Ain't that a bitch, you can't tell a nigga shit 
So I mind my own, find my home 
Now I'm in the zone 
Behind Farmers in the alley, gettin' my money on 
Had 10 dollas & JB gave me the other 10 
Bought a breakdown, now I'm Gone With The Wind 
Brakes with the ???, ounces & QP's 
The half ki's, now I'm sellin' weight to the G's 
Hit Oxford Street, spent a grip, now I'm ready to go 
To Hogan Hoctors, it be bitches at the talent show 
And for all & hoop games had hoes

This brings the homicide rate in the state of California to one of the

And is now known to you as killa kali

(Verse 1)
The state of California niggas call it killa kali
Murder weapons in the river bodies found in the alleys

Body bags gettin zipped up
Heads blown off wit they insides ripped up
Mobile phones flipped up
Factors callin shots
Bitch made niggas its some real niggas on the block
Cause every hood got a trigga happy nigga
That don't give a fuck about puttin two in your liver
But how you figure you can do dirt and stay clean
Niggas like that get pronounced dead on the scene
ain't no winnin teams cause everybody taken losses in they hood
Reminiscin on they niggas man I wish I could
Bring back the homies that I lost up in that funk season
Gotta check myself or let that alcohol be the reason
So I just poor a little liquor on the concrete
For my dead homies and the ones who ain't gone see the streets
Locked up with the rest of the locs
But whatever the reason my folks are walkin the yard
Or gettin they guts some
Tryin to make it home but I think they
Safer in that pin cause niggas on gin be lettin them Mack 10's
Bust 32 times
And niggas who ain't in it gettin shot by
Standards on the block
Smokin like bomb
Fools given up they cell
Gettin sideways leaven them t-shirts soakin wet
Retaliation is a must
So now you know them niggas you was funkin wit
Gone be at yo do so
Keep yo hand on yo nina in the valley
Or get dumped in the alley
Fuckin around in killa kali

(Chorus 1)
Mothers on they knees
Wit tears in they eyes why
(cause killa kali is the state of the drive by)
Mothers on they knees
Wit tears in they eyes why
(cause killa kali is the state of the drive by)

(Chorus 2)
It's killa kali It's killa kali
buddahba
It's killa kali It's killa kali
buck buck
It's killa kali It's killa kali
budduhba
It's killa kali It's killa kali
buck buck

(Verse 2)
The killins on
ain't even safe when you at home
Whatever dirt you do
gone follow you until you gone
So pack ya chrome
And handle your own cause potnas tend to run
Walked in the party 10 deep and only left wit one
Real nigga on your team
But you know how it is
Can't even trust them niggas that you knew since you was kids
It ain't no thang
I let them niggas have it to
Bitch up and I switch up on that ass before I blast you
And fools better watch them hoes in they mix
Seen them chosen and you bid on that set up for a six
foot ditch with your family in front of you
So many niggas slip
That's how they slide a bitch up under you
I wonder whose the next nigga
To catch a bullet for sex nigga
Thought you was cock until they chopped you with them tecs nigga
I think the game is on its last leg
Trigga happy niggas wit no heart
It ain't no used to be
For your life
cause out here they quick to take they own
Snortin that Peruvian
On Hennessey you know they gone
can't tell a nigga shit in the 9-5
All about they scrilla doin niggas in on the side
Bellin through yo hood buckin fools down
Gettin caught slippin with they mutherfuckin pants down
Sleep with one eye open in the valley
cause everything you love'll get smoked up in killa kali

(Chorus 1)

(Chorus 2)

(Verse 3)
California niggas be plottin on fools
Jackin mutherfuckers for them daytons
And leave that ol' school
Sittin on with yo face in the dash
two in the back of yo head
Rip yo pockets of then laugh
Then you got them fools on the track pullin out glocks
Pistol whippin niggas till they drop
Reach in they draws and take they rocks
They money
They rings and they chains
Without a skimask on
But can't complain
Its all in the game
Follow one of them ballers to  they residence
tyin niggas up
Lookin for them dead presidents
Its for the money
You know the scratch but now we call it scrilla
It turned them kali niggas into straight killas
Set trippin on a daily basis
Vietnam ain't shit on what a nigga in the hood faces
1-8-7 case
Cop into a lesser charge
Three strikes
Hit you with that L
Lock behind bars
Bellin wit a strap
Punks seem like its waitin
To catch a nigga slippin or get killed over conversation
Fuckin wit bitch will get you killed quick
Niggas let they hoes mow down they homies on the real beitch
Fools come to kali thinkin club med
Caught up in the cross fire when them sets bump heads
Keep yo hand on ya nina in the valley
Or everything you love'll get smoked up in killa kali

What's up for today, I'm tryin' to kick it, know the homie wit it
Soup up my dog, we hittin' corners, gettin' seven digits
'cause they come out when the sun out, it's on again
I make 'em grin when they see the chrome rim spin
Twenty inch, don't know I'm stingy like the Grinch
I penny-pinch, let them play once and sit the bench
It's a cinch, to pull 'em out of the season
If she choose me, don't let that broad be the reason
Smash off and leave a cloud, music bump loud
Ride through the park and let them fifteens move the crowd
Pop out and bail through somebody barbeque
Make a play, drink a brew, see what I can run through
And half naked in the summer, I'm collecting numbers
I tell 'em keep it on the under, waiting for the sun up
Go down so I can clown, late-night creeping
That's how we kick it, every day is tha weekend

Leavin' traces of burnt rubber on the floor
Everywhere we go, we light it up like the side show
I'm sittin' on the door hangin' out the vehicle
It's Breezy in the store, yellin' ""Celly, where you feel to go?""
Straight-lacin', pervin' until I'm on my face and
No destination, follow me, I got the population
To get yo' go, it's on when we hit the scene
I know you feign for them sticky, mean collard greens
Blowin' zips, chasin' chips, watchin' money flip
Trade more stories, reminiscin' wit' my click
Takin' flicks, never know when the party over
Every summer, it seem like I lose another soldier
Even ones havin' fun gotta watch yo' back
They still creepin, every day is tha weekend

We get the party started when we step in the clubs

You can holla at a playa, I got nuttin' but love
""There they go."" That's what they say when we hit the floor
Get our groove on fo' sho', you know, that's how it go
Got tennis shoes on and I'm still gettin' in
See me at the bar, reelin' 'em in, I'm tryin' to win
Seen this notch with this tight dress on filin'
She kept smilin', sippin' on Long Islands
They was zealous, I love it when a woman choose
And when she hear this conversation, I can't lose
It don't stop, late night, still on the town
Slide by the after hours spot and put it down

Why must I be like that?
Loccing up on niggas I don't know, they might be waiting for me
Where the show?
To get me death, or peel my caps so I step back
Holla at them niggas wit' my hand on my strap
Ain't tryin' to see, they tryin' to makin' me a memory
I'm definitely first, if you get away, remember me
I been a hoe up in this shit before I came on
Just a single with a mic on my hand
I had them heaters ready to flame on

[E-40]
We like to mob, M.O.B. my organization of business, why'all
Fuck with me and I route you'll never see another Christmas
Expect Nicholas to be dressed in black
Coming down the chimney bustin' caps
Superficial goons to the backs and spleen
Dumping like a garbage man, through my team
Shotgun pellets all over the place
Bodies all in the kitchen, all on the staircase
BACK THAT UP!

Yeah, you got Celly Cel back in this muthafucka 
Once again, you know 
'Bout to drop this soul playa shit on y'all 
You know, nothin' but that realness 
Can ya feel this though 
Yeah.. Gonna ride wit ya nigga cuz it's goin' down 

They say break yo'self or make yo'self 
So I said fuck it, bought a glock so I could take myself 
Through all this soft shit a nigga face as a youngsta 
Loc'ed ass niggas made that hillside a monster 
OG's hoopin' at the school house & shootin' dice 
In & out the pen, real niggas might ? nice 
Made this hog get the brew
Made me hit the weed 
Eatin' at the ho house 
Moms know a nigga kill 
Go to my room, sleep off my high, and hit the door 
Tellin' myself ""I ain't smokin' weed no more"" 
But you know 
Them lies as the days go by 
Me, Choo-Choo & Clyde smokin' dank 'til the sun rise 
Walk into the school house 
Franklin Junior 
Back when it was cool to kiss & tell and spread rumors 
Boxin' toe to toe & everybody in a circle 
Sockin' mutha-fuckas 'til they eyes turn purple 
Ain't no set trippin', no jumpin', it's just 1 on 1 
Fools throwin' thangs to the end 
Back then, it was fun 
No gunshots 
No need to hit the floor 
But after shool 
The whole city woken up 
Let's hit the park fool 
To see a little league, a Babe Ruth baseball game 
Niggas was down there cuttin' up or throwin' thangs 
Chasin' 5 off for hot dogs & fries bitch 
But back then, you still couldn't tell a nigga shit

Got a little older, now the park is a joke 
'Cause all the ball players out there slangin' dope 
Some of my niggas is on grimmies, but I didn't slip 
Ain't that a bitch, you can't tell a nigga shit 
So I mind my own, find my home 
Now I'm in the zone 
Behind Farmers in the alley, gettin' my money on 
Had 10 dollas & JB gave me the other 10 
Bought a breakdown, now I'm Gone With The Wind 
Brakes with the ???, ounces & QP's 
The half ki's, now I'm sellin' weight to the G's 
Hit Oxford Street, spent a grip, now I'm ready to go 
To Hogan Hoctors, it be bitches at the talent show 
And for all & hoop games had hoes 
Hilail & Hogie, you know it was on fo' sho' 
Reece assists & Redge with the Tamahawk ? up 
Then the whole town, mobbin' down to the waterfront 
Niggas in Granadas, Cougars & Mustangs 
Stars & Volvos 
Nobody fuckin' with them ? thangs 
Me, G-Roc, JB & Lil' C-Mo 
Puffin' on indo 
Splittin' 4 double O Z's 
Young G's tryin' to live 
And when they shut the ship door, we goin' under the bridge 
Gettin' whip-lash from the brake gas mash and dip 
'Cause back then, you couldn't tell a nigga shit

Made it to a G, but ain't no love in my city 
Now we set trippin', all these fools actin' shitty 
Niggas wanna reel me in, but didn't know 
When you fuckin' wit the big fish, you fuckin' wit a funeral 
No more toe to toe 
HK-44's 
Now what they know about the mutha fuckin' murda shows 
Strap on my right hand side, in the Bay area 
Shit is gettin' scarier 
Niggas are ??? 
Fuck the bird, I'm the nigga bailin' ? early 
Trigga happy nigga wit a head fulla Shirlies, on 
Christian brothas in ??? 
Or drinkin' hurricanes wit my niggas in da click 
So deep, I can't call it 
Spend about a million dollas at the liquor store 
I'm just an alcoholic 
40, Water & Legit put me on the map 
Got my foot in the door, now I'm givin' up dank 
Sick wit his last job, my 9 to 5 
The shit I used to dream about is how I survive 
Lifestyle of a mack 
Funk for life 
Some Heat 4 Yo' Azz 
Them Killa Kali niggas blast and smash 
Without a murda weapon or a witness 
Too many niggas in yo' car, risky business 
They turn snitches 
Break down & have the po-po's at yo' front door 
And all real niggas know 
Who rides sucka-free, on the solo 
When you empty the clip, they can't tell a nigga shit

Never seen candy with the fifth on the back

And bust a right Coney Island pop the trunk and started capping
Niggas was happening put they Burboun to the floor nigga
Hard to bust back but I was penetrating they doe

Steady fronting like a man but you show me a punk

You niggas didn't know that I was outta control
Slow yo roll for I put this chopper straight to yo fo
Head you better off dead than to fuck around with psycho niggas
Don't be trying to plead yo case cuz I don't even like no niggas
In my face, trying to question me about some drama
Only answer to two people: God and my mama
Far as niggas trying to put me in the cross,
Let em holler at my bitch, Nina Ross hoe house boss
I bet you mind something in, run and tell a friend
? on the Gin, I think he said ""trippin"" once again
It ain't no stopping me, get at me then I'm dumping on ya,
Riding past yo funeral hanging out the window slumping on ya
You didn't know, they didn't tell you boy you better listen
While I shoot this shit before you put yourself in that position
Niggas that know me know I specialize in having bump
You can have the tail way from the shovel so we can pop the trunk

These niggas keep talking like they want the funk
Man cause his bitch chose me I fin to pop the trunk
Running off at they dick suckers getting it crunk
Cause I'm fucking yo gal I got to pop the trunk

All we really came to do is just smoke some scum
Smoking at the tittie bar I had to pop the trunk

Under Cali's blue skies, smoking on chronicles and chocolate ties
Even when we tell the truth, the hoes we lies,
Man ain't no disguise, doing ninety week flies,
Ain't got no time for middle men and small fries,
Only money conversation and big thighs,
Let me talk to your boss man, the nigga wit the pies,
And back yo ass up and don't act so surprised,
When pistols start to cock, hands start to rise,
Nobody move too fast I advise,
Or you can catch a hot one right between ya eyes,
Recognize I done set me sights on the prize,
And put lights out with boom fifty bye, bye's,
I'm labeling my life off of rap and weed highs,
And ask my agent bout my fucking shoe size.,
But fucking wit us ain't wise,
We get crunk, we came to pop the trunk
What, the trunk

These niggas keep talking like they want the funk
I knew he was the police I had to pop the trunk
Running off at they dick suckers gettin it crunk
Man I'm sipping on ? popping the trunk
Steady fronting like a man but you show me a punk

All we really came to do is just smoke some scum
To make it, make it crunk I had to pop the trunk

Won't leave the house unless I'm strapped up
I might get backed up in the traffic
Niggas is dumping on me when I got my zapper
Creeping up on me when I had one hand on the wheel
One hand on the steel, trying to break a nigga's thinking
Ride with shoot, sharpening skills for season whatever the reason
I'm dealing with drama; send one of them bitchez-ass niggas
Crying to Mama; I kicking the door to alleviate the whole situation
Fuck with me, he ended up having his whole family erased
Face it, no charges, leaving the body until you better respect game
Fuck that, when niggas spill fuck your hood
When your caught up in a twist flash on us, you'll end up sleeping
With the fish singing, shoes honey singing
Them blues and them sad ballads
Fried colla greens and potato salads
So rounded them up; so many family member crying
Eye for an eye, you ride or you die

Niggas get itching when you run back at them
And let them bullets fly

He moved one; oh, moved back on the piggies; hit'em up and buck
And leave them struck when I'm dictation love for the thugs
That die for this shit with a hundred fifty round, drive
For this shit, fuck the hard hats and locs; pass the fo' fo'
And watch me smoke them hos like the last hitter indoer
Fo' sho', smash and blast, nigga, when I'm provoked
With a loaded magnum coke, I'm down

[Celly Cel]
Why you smiling when these niggas and bitches be playing games?
In the street is where they meet the heat
That's where they sweep their ass up off their feet
This ain't no fairy-tale; you fucking with Cel
Hit the scenes with machines if you want my team
There ain't no in-between seventeen in that place
When your crossing the realest
Niggas is business; kill this shit on the mic
And make the world feel us hit them with rounds; hollow tips
When we're finished, niggas chop they ass up
Till they fully out of...

Niggas get itchy when you run back at them
And let them bullets fly

[C-Bo]
I ain't no actor, bitch; my life is worser than the movies
For real though, from steel toes to my uzi pushers
Impala S.S., Benz Beamer, to Lamborghinis and chase my strip
With X.O. Henn and Remi Rolex on my wrist; hundred bill, crisp
I pull a blunt from my lit forty-five from my hip and spit
Incredible, medical hardcore; the deadliest metaliest
Gas ever set off in a war; westcoast, the spot where
We making millin dollar noise; survival in heck-packing heat
Ducking from them, I'm just a thug nigga, step on your street
And draw my heat then I plug niggas I be a G
From the G.B.C., I mug niggas; don't flag, I just sag
And carry a mag and get off in the snitches' asses
You a bitch, but still ride or die, screaming out the block

Ich weiß, dass sie heiß ist und nicht Nein sagt

Sie steigt ein mit ei'm Smile, setzt Cousin hinten

Aus Prinzip fährt sie nur im AMG und in Jeeps

Im Rotlicht läuft nichts ohne Kondom
Hier dagegen läuft - vom Jung'n
Machst vor der Familie auf braves Mädchen
Um Jungfrau zu bleiben hast du oft Arsch gegeben

Mit diesem Album meistert ihr jede Schikane
Iminiár el skupido, heißt Kurac, ""Schwanz""
Ich erkläre Jargon auf Deutsch für Franz und Hans
Für's ganze Land, ich kann wie ein Duden spitten
Haye´d em kurda heißt Leben ist'n Rudelficken
Das Leben ist 'n Swingerclub
Fick deine Mutter heißt nique mouk
Guck, ich bin Hood-Translator
Eintopf nennt man bei uns Marmeta, Arwena
Heißt Party bis zum Siedepunkt
Crystal in der Nase und Hennessy im Mund
Denn wir sind Jungs, die sich nicht verbiegen und
Aus diesem Grund lieben uns die Fans und zuletzt

Sagt Muharrem, unterbricht sein Cosain
Deutschraps Top 10 damals nur Stadtbekannt
Hazebusters FFM verstrahlt das ganze Land
Die Art die Jeder mag, Rap wie wir reden
Weil Kanacken auf den Straßen diese Texte leben
Red nicht von Gangsterleben, sondern Parallelen
Sozial schwache Gegend, sogenannte Ghettos eben
Prominenten Szene, Innenstadt am Mittag
Blitzlichtgewitter schießt Bilder mit Kindern
Selbst dein Minister findet's nicht mehr witzig
Kids schreien HJ wie 1940
Müşteri's kommen mit ihren kleinen Brüdern
Holen 100 Stücke und fragen nach'nem Picture

Erst mit Headsets Magic Studios
Jetzt gibt's Gangbangs, im Touringbus!
Von Graskilos in Volkswagenbus
Franzaforta läuft auf Yavido
Habibo, der Goldsteinsüder
Erzählt euch von heute und früher
Es umfasst, dies und das

Als Bauchtaschen-Rapper, Saunaclub-Gänger
Gehört der Coup zu meinen Aufgabenfeldern
Ich brauch Para, damit Fickfotzen blasen
Ich muss Fixkosten tragen, die kann Rick Ross nicht zahlen
Nuttensohn, mit dem 5-Sterne-Hacker
Brauchen wir nicht die Scheibe mit 'ner Zündkerze schmettern
Durch komplizierte Passwort-Spiele am Smartphone
Klickt die Tür des Lamborghini Gallardos
Celo steigt ein am Lenkrad, F1 Schaltung
Vom Auspuff der Sound ist besser als mein Album
In Garage tun wir die Wagen schnell bunkern
Verbrennen mit der Flex die Fahrgestell-Nummern
Die Einzelteile werden verkauft, statt an Banker
An Kanaken-Händler aus Balkan-Ländern
Nutte, ist der Bodensatz dick
Wird am Ende doch eh die ganze Kohle verfickt, ah

The Heist letzter Coup, Doppel-S-I-O

Benz-Kombi, mit Kindersitz auf Rückbank geknackt
Während Eltern-Sprechtag schnell in die Werkstatt
Next stop, Hayde gib ihr, Bottegas
Ce und A rippen Cars made in Modena
Yeah, ich hab on entourage 'n Top-Hacker
In Null Komma Nix auf Servern von NSA
Doch der Supra-Toyota aus Japan, Asien
Muss diesmal rustikal behandelt werden, Classic
Wie als die Blaupunkt Hips gerobbt wurden
Grand Theft Auto, Warschauer Pol'n
Im Noir Daimle, durch Frankfurt
Leere Straßen, ich glaub, hier spukt's

Niemals, zieh den Coup durch, Blutdruck
Durchsuch den Benz nach Flus und Uhr'n, Schmuck

So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me

We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Es lief nicht immer rund bei mir, am Anfang hatte ich nicht viel
Ich hatte noch kein Ziel, keine Platte und kein' Deal
Doch ich hatte das Gefühl, dass ich die Welt verändern könnte
Ich legte los, auch wenn man mir nur selten etwas gönnte
Sie gaben mir ein Auto, ein paar Riesen und ein Haus
Dch alles, was ich wollte, war die Liebe meiner Frau
Sie halten sich für Gott, wollen den Shaitan überlisten
Ihr seid keine Atheisten, doch habt nie an mich geglaubt
Ich stieg aus dem Volk, hatte nie mehr gewollt
Alles was ich anfasse riecht nach erfolg
Doch ich lief nie mit Gold oder irgendwelchen Klunkern rum
Wenn ich auf der Bühne steh', spür' ich die Bewunderung
Früher noch im Untergrund, heute bin ich oben, sie
Hören diese Strophe, während sie mit meiner Krone spielen

And your love is the inspiration that I need 
Writing songs for you 
Is the way I find to thank you for this

Face the music 
Dance to the music 
Now I hear the sound of music 
And your kisses take it closer to perfection 
You´re beyond imagination 
We´re the dream team 
You´re so good to me

And I hope to give you back the peace of mind 
That you give to me

With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've know
And why do you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to you
Why do you sing with me at all?

We might live like never before
When there's nothing to give

We might make love in some sacred place

Celso Piña,"Fue en un pueblo con mar una noche 
Después de un concierto
Tu reinabas detrás 
De la barra del único bar que vimos abierto

Cántame una canción al oído y te pongo un cubata 
Con una condición 
Que me dejes abierto el balcón de tus ojos de gata 
Loco por conocer los secretos 
De tu dormitorio
Esa noche cante 
Al piano del amanecer todo mi repertorio

Los clientes del bar uno a uno se fueron marchando
Tu saliste a cerrar 
Yo me dije cuidado chaval te estas enamorando 
Luego todo paso de repente 
Tu dedo en mi espalda
Dibujo un corazón 
Y mi mano le correspondió debajo de tu falda

Caminito al ostar nos besamos en cada farola
Era un pueblo con mar 
Yo quería dormir contigo tu no querías dormir sola 

Y nos dieron las diez y las once
Las doce y la una, las dos y las tres 
Y desnudos al amanecer 
Nos encontró la luna

Nos dijimos adiós ojala que volvamos a vernos
El verano acabo 
El otoño dura lo que tarda en llegar el invierno
Fui a tu pueblo el azar otra vez 
El verano siguiente, 
Me llevo y al final 
Del concierto me puse a buscar tu cara entre la gente

Y no ella quien de ti me dijera 
Ni media palabra, 
Parecía como si 
Me quisiera gastar el destino una broma macabra 

No había nadie detrás de la barra 
Del otro verano, 
Y en lugar de tu bar 
Me encontré una sucursal del banco hispanoamericano 
Tu memoria vengue a pedradas 
Contra los cristales, 
Se que no lo soñé 
Protestaba mientras me esposaban los municipales

Y en mi declaración alegue 
Que llevaba tres copas, 
Y empece esta canción 
En el cuarto donde aquella vez te quitaba la ropa 

Y nos dieron las diez y las once 
Las doce y la una las dos y las tres 
Y desnudos al amanecer nos encontró la luna",Y Nos Dieron Las Diez
Celso Piña,"Por que terminar con mas daños,no debes pensar 
Que te he fallado si enamorado por ti 
Muero en tus brazos siempre te amare. 

Como decir lo que senti tu me hiciste feliz 
Debes borrar ese engaño que te hace dudar 
Al pensar en mi,quiero que entiendas algo 
No te quiero convencer tu eres la ilusion 
De mi vida siempre llorare al pensar en ti 

Y al fin lograste irte de mis brazos lo (2) 
Que sentias por mi lo dejaste ir,el recuerdo 
De tu adios me llevare te fuiste y me dejaste 
Solo muy solo con una ilusion siempre llorare 
Al pensar en ti.",Al Pensar en Ti
Celso Piña,"Recuerdas aquella noche 
Cuando la luna brillaba tan bella 
Y en el cielo aquellas estrellas radiaban 
De luz y color 

Radiaban de luz y color asemejando la fina esperma

Llenando mi alma tan simple 
Trayendo a mi los recuerdos, las cosas 
Que tu me dijiste 

Las cosas que tu me dijiste 
Aquella noche que estaba tan bella 
Luna llena mi alma de cumbia 
Saca de mi la locura 
Llévame a la luz y a la paz

Será que me dejaste esa honda herida  
Será que me dejaste sin consuelo 
Será que sin tus besos yo me muero

Por eso no quiero que me dejes 
Por eso no quiero que te alejes 
Por eso te pido que regreses

Y, en vez de lamentarme, he decidido
Tomármelo con calma
De par en par he abierto los balcones
He sacudido el polvo a todos los rincones
De mi alma

Me he dicho que la vida no es un valle
De lágrimas y he salido a la calle
Como un explorador
He vuelto a tropezar con el pasado
Y he decidido, en el bar de mis pecados
Otra copa de ron

Y en otros ojos me olvidé de tu mirada
Y en otros labios despisté a la madrugada
Y en otro pelo
Me curé del desconsuelo
Que empapaba mi almohada

Y en otros puertos he atracado mi velero
Y en otros cuartos he colgado mi sombrero
Y una mañana
Comprendí que aveces gana
El que pierde a una mujer

Con el cartel de libre en la solapa
He vuelto a ser un guapo entre las guapas
Chulapas de madrid
Sólo me pongo triste cuando alguno
En el momento más inoportuno
Me pregunta por ti",Como un Explorador

Por un hueco que existía

Cuando apareció su padre
Con la vara de avellano
En la mano amenazando
Fue tras ellas como pudo y
Tropezó con la botella

Y ahora felices estamos
Y colorín colorado

Celtas Cortos,"Una vez me fui de vacaciones 
Unos días a Italia con amigos de Madrid 
Y allí vi las cosas más extrañas
En un día cualquiera que yo solo me perdí. 
Comenzó cuando me equivoqué de autobús 
De regreso para volver al camping 
Y aparecí en un lugar de cutre 
Donde todos me miraban con cara de jabalí. 

Pregunté y un buen hombre me dijo 
""Para volver muchacho tu vente por aquí"" 
Cuando en estas que me saca una navaja
Aflójame la pasta o te rajo el cabecín. 
Y al ver que yo no tenia ni chapa
Me llevó por un callejón gris,
En estas que vi un coche que arrancaba
Y fui corriendo y de un salto allí dentro me metí.
Los del coche se llevaron gran susto
Por lo cual el conductor murió,
Nos caímos por una cuneta,
Partiéndonos la crisma y también el esternón.

Cuatro días después de estar en cama 
Ya por fin desperté del gran shock 
Y lo único que yo veía era una enfermera 
Que de mi se enamoró. 
Me cuidó como si fuera mi madre 
Hasta que salí por propio pie, 
Momento en el cual ella me dijo: 
Por fin tu y yo los padres, este crío tuyo es. 
Me da el crío y yo no entiendo nada, 
Se va corriendo y abandona el hospital, 
Y en Jamaica no se que idioma hablan, 
El crío me sonríe ya aprenderá castellano. 

Y al final aparece un policía 
Digo yo que si me podrá ayudar, 
Ya por fin en la comisaría 
Me detienen por secuestro y no llevar el carnet. 
Semanas después de este percance 
Se aclaró lo del secuestro 
Pero no lo del carnet 
Consecuencia tres días en chirona 
Donde conocí una peña 
Por lo menos enrollada 
Cuarenta días después de todo 
Llegue nadando hasta cerca de Irún 
De allí a dedo hasta mi casa 
Que alegría que alboroto y otro perrito piloto!

Qué vaya un chico que era, 
Qué todo el día por ahí"". 

Los colegas que les deje colgados 
""Qué vaya un mal amigo, 
Qué no vuelven a salir"".

No os coléis nunca en el autobús,

¿Te sorprende que te escriba?
Tanto tiempo es normal

Pues es que estaba aquÃ­ solo
Me habÃ­a puesto a recordar

Las risas que nos hacíamos antes todos juntos
Hoy no queda casi nadie de los de antes 
Y los que hay, han cambiado
Han cambiado, sí

Pero bueno, ¿tú qué tal? Di
Lo mismo hasta tienes críos
Qué tal te va con el tí­o ese?

Sigo currando en lo mismo

Me da igual largarme de aquí

De pequeño nací
No se como ni cuando ni donde
Me subí a un escenario
Me puse a cantar
Why aquí estoy cansao de viajar
Has venido a buscar un poco de emoción
Una birra why una canción
Pero no hay solución
Cada noche es lo mismo de ayer
Lo mismo de hoy
Cada noche a las 10 me dejo la piel ahí arriba
Hay muchos aplausos
Pero a veces no se si voy a ser capaz
De aguantar una semana mas
Si pudiera cambiar no lo haria por nada del mundo
Solo quiero beber, aunque se que mañana al salir
Me voy a arrepentir
Te voy a echar de menos con tanto palique

Me sentí fatal

Celtas Cortos,"In Banbridge Town in the County Down
One morning last July
From a boreen green came a sweet colleen
And she smiled as she passed me by
She looked so sweet from her two bare feet
To the sheen of her nut brown hair
Such a coaxing elf, sure I shook myself
For to see I was really there

From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay and
From Galway to Dublin Town
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen
That I met in the County Down

As she onward sped, sure I scratched my head
And I looked with a feelin' rare
And I says, says I, to a passer-by
""Who's the maid with the nut brown hair?""
He smiled at me and he says, says he
""That's the gem of Ireland's crown
Young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann
She's the star of the County Down.""

From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay and
From Galway to Dublin Town
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen
That I met in the County Down

At the Harvest Fair she'll be surely there
And I'll dress in my Sunday clothes
With my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked right
For a smile from my nut brown rose
No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke
Till my plough turns rust coloured brown
Till a smiling bride by my own fireside
Sits the star of the County Down

Di que estaba ciego

Hay dos cosas que sostienen de un país su dignidad
Las dos piernas que sujetan que esto sea una sociedad

Es lo bueno que parece, primo
Ten cuidao con ello
Porque lo malo que esto tiene
Es lo bueno que parece, prenda
Ten cuidao con ellos

Porque si hablo de la escuela
Como si fuera el ministro

Y si quito subvenciones, para los libros de texto
Y si cierro comedores se agudizará el ingenio

My waken eyes may never see,
Surround my bed
That from which they sprung - eternity

Beneath the turf
The silent dead

Sleep brings no wish to knit
My harassed heart beneath
My only wish is to forget
In the sleep of death
Death is my joy
I long to be at rest
I wish the damp earth covered
This desolate brest

Beneath the mould
The silent dead

But the glad eyes around us
Must weep as we have done
And we must see the same gloom
Eclipse their morning sun

Oh not for them 
Should we despair
The grave is drear 
But they're not there
Their dust is mingled 
With the sod
Their pale souls 
Are gone, to god

Well, may they live in ecstasy
Their long eternity of joy
At least I wouldn't bring them down
With me to weep, to groan

As some fair woman, lost in cushions deep
With gentle hand caresses listlessly
The contour of her breasts before she sleeps
On velvet backs of avalanches soft
She often lies enraptured as she dies
And gazes on white visions aloft

Which like a blossoming to heaven rise
When sometimes on this globe, in indolence
She lets a secret tear drop down, by chance
A poet, set against oblivion
Takes in his hand this pale and furtive tear
This opal drop where rainbow hues appear
And hides it in his breast far from the sun",Sorrows of the Moon

Bleeding sweet for dying blind.

Locked up in a room
Human belongs in a cage

Absorbing lifes hidden anguish

It's happy he is to live single and free.

At each wedding feast, as they call in the priest
To invoke marriage blessings, the boys wonder in silence
If God will allow this poor man take a vow
To surrender his will and be doomed to compliance.

For many's the bachelor gets into a match
For the glories of love and connubial bliss,
Too late to discover his wife's not his lover
And he wishes his Missus was still just a Miss.

There was young Packy Hayes, all singin' the praise
Of the wee lass who's father was cursed with the naggin',
We knew if he married himself would be harried,
His songs now lament that his spirits are draggin'.

For the new Mrs. Hayes had a mouth full of nays
That she learned from her mother, a creature displeasin',
Their schemes and their plots tied Packy in knots,
They'd prevent peace from pleasin' his soul any season.

So young men take care if a wedding you dare,
Pick a girl that was raised to take great joy in life.
The woman you wed should delight in your bed,
And not stand on your hand like poor Packy's wife.
And you old ones take warning, lest you be left mourning
That no man will wed or take your daughter's hand,
If you will impart the goodwill of your heart
It's of peace and contentment you'll have full command.",The Bachelor's Warning
Celtic Thunder,"Like a bird without wings
That longs to be flying,
Like a motherless child
Left lonely and crying.
Like a song without words,
Like a world without music,
I wouldn't know what to do
I'd be lost without you
Watchin' over me.

I get so lonely, when you're away
I count every moment, I wait every day,
Until you're home again
And hug me so tight
That's when I know
Everything is alright.

That longs to be flying,
Like a motherless child
Left lonely and crying.

Like a world without music,

Watchin' over me.

You're my guardian angel
My light and my guide
Your hand on my shoulder
And you by my side.
You make everything beautiful,
You make me complete.
Everything in my world
I lay at your feet

Like a church with no steeple,
Where a bell never rings.
In a town without people,
Where no voice in the choir ever sings.
If a boat on the ocean
Would be lost with no sail,
Then without your devotion
Surely all that I dreamed of would fail.

Like a song without words
Like a world without music,
I wouldn't know what to do
I'd be lost without you

And castle walls just lead me to despair.

Hills of forest green where the mountains touch the sky,
A dream come true, I'll live there till I die.
I'm asking you to say my last goodbye.
The love we knew ain't worth another try.

Save me from all the trouble and the pain.
I know I'm weak, but I can't face that girl again.
Tell her the reasons why I can't remain,
Perhaps she'll understand if you tell it to her plain.

But how can words express the feel of sunlight in the morning,
In the hills, away from city strife.
I need a country woman for my wife;
I'm city born, but I love the country life.

For I cannot be part of this cocktail generation:
Partners waltz, devoid of all romance.
The music plays and everyone must dance.
I'm bowing out. I need a second chance.

Save me from all the trouble and the pain.
I know I'm weak, but I can't face that girl again.
Tell her the reasons why I can't remain,

A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I?m older

Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like a world upon my shoulders
Through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

In my life there?s been heartache and pain
I don?t know if I can face it again
Can?t stop now, I?ve travelled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
And I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
And I know you can show me

I'm gonna take a little time
I?m gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
'cause I?ve got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

In my life there?s been heartache and pain
I don?t know if I can face it again
I can?t stop now, I?ve traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
And I want you to show me

And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy

We're more like strangers now

Letters I?ve written
Never meaning to send

Beauty I?d always missed
With these eyes before
Just what the truth is
I can?t say anymore

Cause? I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you

Gazing at people
Some hand in hand
Just what I?m going through
They can?t understand

Some try to tell me
Thoughts they can?t defend
Just what you want to be
You will be in the end

Oh, how I love you

And I love you
Yes, I love you

Put on her suit of leather-o
T'was a cry all around the door

Inquiring for his lady-o

My big horse is not speedy-o
I will ride and I?ll seek me bride

As the battles raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me

So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones

Tonight's the night,
I've waited for
Because you're not a baby any more
You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen

My little tomboy now wears satin and lace

Then when you were ten we didn't like each other
When you were thirteen, you were my funny valentine

From now on you're gonna be mine

So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air

Won't you please bring my baby to me

Celtic Thunder,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Christmas Medley: The Most Wonderful Time of the Year/We Wish You a Mer

To see once more the folks I've been missing

Being back where I belong

It's Christmas and I'm going home

I'll say goodbye to the lights of Broadway

Celtic Thunder,"The Dutchman's not the kind of man
Who keeps his thumb jammed in the dam
That holds his dreams in,
But that's a secret that only Margaret knows.

When Amsterdam is golden in the summer,
Margaret brings him breakfast,
She believes him.
He thinks the tulips bloom beneath the snow.

He's mad as he can be, but Margaret only sees that sometimes,
Sometimes she sees her unborn children in his eyes.

Let us go to the banks of the ocean
Where the walls rise above the Zuider Zee.
Long ago, I used to be a young man
And dear Margaret remembers that for me.

The Dutchman still wears wooden shoes,
His cap and coat are patched with the love
That Margaret sewed there.
Sometimes he thinks he's still in Rotterdam.

And he watches the tug-boats down canals
An' calls out to them when he thinks he knows the Captain.
Till Margaret comes
To take him home again

Through unforgiving streets that trip him, though she holds his arm,
Sometimes he thinks he's alone and he calls her name.

Let us go to the banks of the ocean
Where the walls rise above the Zuiderzee.
Long ago, I used to be a young man
And dear Margaret remembers that for me.

The winters whirl the windmills 'round
She winds his muffler tighter
And they sit in the kitchen.
Some tea with whiskey keeps away the dew.

And he sees her for a moment, calls her name,
She makes the bed up singing some old love song,
A song Margaret learned
When it was very new.

He hums a line or two, they sing together in the dark.
The Dutchman falls asleep and Margaret blows the candle out.

Where the walls rise above the Zuiderzee.

Celtic Thunder,"Well, I took a stroll on the old long walk
Of a day -I-ay-I-ay
I met a little girl and we stopped to talk
Of a fine soft day -I-ay-I-ay
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue
And I knew right then I'd be takin' a whirl
'Round the Salthill Prom with a Galway girl

We were halfway there when the rain came down
Of a day -I-ay-I-ay
And she asked me up to her flat downtown
Of a fine soft day -I-ay-I-ay
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue
So I took her hand and I gave her a twirl
And I lost my heart to a Galway girl

When I woke up I was all alone
With a broken heart and a ticket home
And I ask you now, tell me what would you do

Home, home, home from the sea
Angels of mercy, answer our plea
And carry us home, home, home from the[ sea
Carry us safely home from the sea.

On a cold winters night
With a storm at its height
The lifeboat answered the call.
They pitched and they tossed
Till we thought they were lost
As we watched from the harbor wall.
Though the night was pitch black,
There was no turning back,
For someone was waiting out there,
But each volunteer
Had to live with his fear
As they joined in a silent prayer.

[Chorus]

As they battled their way
Past the mouth of the bay,
It was blowing like never before.
As they gallantly fought,
Every one of them thought
Of loved ones back on the shore.

Then a flicker of light
And they knew they were right.
There she was on the crest of a wave.
She's an old fishing boat
And she's barely afloat.
Please God, there are souls we can save.

[Chorus]

And back in the town
In a street that runs down
To the sea and the harbor wall,
They'd gathered in pairs
At the foot of the stairs
To wait or the radio call.
And just before dawn
When all hope had gone
Came a hush and a faraway sound.
'Twas the coxswain he roared
All survivors on board
Thank God and we're homeward bound.

When on the world the mists began to fall,
Out of the dreams that rose in happy throng
Low to our hearts Love sang an old sweet song;
And in the dusk where fell the firelight gleam,
Softly it wove itself into our dream.

Just a song a twilight, when the lights are low,
And the flickering shadows softly come and go,
Tho' the heart be weary, sad the day and long,
Still to us at twilight comes Love's old song,
Comes Love's old sweet song.

Even today we hear Love's song of yore,

Deep in our hearts it dwells forevermore.
Footsteps may falter, weary grow the way,
Still we can hear it at the close of day.
So till the end, when life's dim shadows fall,
Love will be found the sweetest song of all.

Just a song a twilight, when the lights are low,
And the flickering shadows softly come and go,
Tho' the heart be weary, sad the day and long,
Still to us at twilight comes Love's old song,
Comes Love's old sweet song.",Just a Song at Twilight

From the midnight well
For it's dark and evil, so they say
The midnight well

They'll tell you a tale of a lovely young maid
The fairest that they'd ever known
What a beauty, they say
But she went her own way
On that night, she set out on her own

For they say, she had a rendezvous
At the midnight well
With a gypsy man she barely knew
At the midnight well

Nobody knew where he came from
But they remember the fire in his eyes
His earring of gold
And his hair black as coal
And a look that could just hypnotize

When he said
Come away, come away with me
Come here and lay with me
Come away out of the light
Come away, come away
Come and ride with me into the night

Never more, they never saw her face
At the midnight well
She was gone, and never left a trace
At the midnight well

They say when the summer nights come to an end
The harvest moon glows in the sky
A black horse will appear and a sound you will hear
As the ghost of a gypsy flies by

And he says
Come away, come away with me
Come here and lay with me
Come away out of the light
Come away, come away
Come and ride with me into the night

Come away, come away with me

Celtic Thunder,"My child arrived just the other day
Came into the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin’ ‘fore I knew it, and as he grew
He’d say “I’m gonna be like you, Dad
You know I’m gonna be like you.”

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, Dad?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, son
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

My son turned ten just the other day
He said, “Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let’s play
Can you teach me to throw?” I said, “Not today
I got a lot to do”, he said, “That’s ok.”
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
And said, “I’m gonna be like him, yeah.
You know I’m gonna be like him.”

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
“Son, I’m proud of you. Can you sit for a while?”
He shook his head and said with a smile,
“What I’d really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later. Can I have them please?”

Well, I’ve long since retired; my son’s moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, “I’d like to see you if you don’t mind.”
He said, “I’d love to, Dad, if I can find the time.
You see, my new job’s a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it’s sure nice talking to you, Dad.
It’s been sure nice talking to you.”

He’d grown up just like me

They opened Ellis Island and they let the people through
And the first to cross the threshold of that isle of hope and tears
Was Annie Moore from Ireland who was all of 15 years

Isle of hope, isle of tears
Isle of freedom, isle of fears
But it’s not the isle you left behind
That isle of hunger, isle of pain
Isle you’ll never see again
But the isle of home is always on your mind

In a little bag, she carried all her past and history
And her dreams for the future in the land of liberty
And courage is the passport when your old world disappears
But there’s no future in the past when you’re 15 years

Isle of freedom, isle of fears
But it’s not the isle you left behind

And the next time I saw her, she bid me goodbye

Twas in the merry month of May, from me home I started,
Left the girls in Tuam, nearly broken hearted,
Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother,
Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother,
Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born
Cut a stout black thorn to banish ghosts and goblin;
Bought  a pair of brogues, rattling o’er the bogs
And fright'ning all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin.

Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road

In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary,
Started by daylight next morning blithe and early,
Took a drop of pure to keep me heart from sinking;
Thats a Paddy's cure whenever he's on drinking.
See the lassies smile, laughing all the while
At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a bubblin'
Asked me was I hired, wages I required,
I was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah!

In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity
To be soon deprived a view of that fine city.
So then I took a stroll, all among the quality;
Me bundle it was stole, all in a neat locality.
Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind,
No bundle could I find upon me stick a wobblin'
Enquiring for the rogue, they said me Connaught brogue
Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah!

From there I got away, me spirits never falling,
Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing.
The Captain at me roared, said that no room had he;
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy.
Down among the pigs, played some hearty rigs,
Danced some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling;
When off Holyhead I wished meself was dead,
Or better for instead on the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah!

The boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed,
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it.
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing;
Poor old Erin's Isle they began abusing.
""Hurrah me soul"" says I, me Shillelagh I let fly.
Some Galway boys were by, saw I was a hobble in,
With a load ""Hurray !"" joined in the affray.
We quickly cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin.

And my father won't slight you for your lack of kine,'
She went away from me and this she did say,
'It will not be long, love, till our wedding day.'

She went away from me and she moved through the fair,
And slowly I watched her move here and move there,
She went his way homeward with one star awake,
As the swan in the evening moves over the lake.

The people were saying no two were e'er wed
But one has a sorrow that never was said,
And I smiled as she passed with her goods and her gear,
And that was the last that I saw of my dear.

She came in so sweetly, her feet made no din;
She stepped up beside me, and this she did say,

And I've no doubt
There's truth in what they say
But sure a body is bound to be a dreamer
When all the things he loves are far away

And precious things
Are dreams unto an exile
They take him o'er
The land across the sea
Especially when it happens he's an exile
From that dear lovely Isle of Innisfree

And when the moonlight
Peeps across the rooftops
Of this great city
Wondrous though it be
I scarcely feel its wonder or its laughter
I'm once again back home in Innisfree

I wander o'e r green hills
Through dreamy valleys
And find a peace
No other land could know
I hear the birds make music fit for angels
And watch the rivers laughing as they flow

And then into a humble shack I wander
My dear old home
And tenderly behold
The folks I love
Around the turf fire gathered
On bended knee
Their rosary is told

But dreams don't last
Though dreams are not forgotten
And soon I'm back
To stern reality

The footways here with gold dust

Celtic Woman,"I wish I was in Carrickfergus
Only for nights in Ballygrand
I would swim over the deepest ocean
The deepest ocean for my love to find

But the sea is wide and I cannot swim over
Neither have I wings to fly
If I could find me a handsome boatsman
To ferry me over to my love and die

My childhood days bring back sad reflections
Of happy times spent so long ago
My childhood friends and my own relations
Have all passed on now like melting snow

But I'll spend my days in endless roaming
Soft is the grass, my bed is free
Ah, to be back now in Carrickfergus
On that long road down to the sea

I'll spend my days in endless roaming
Soft is the grass, my bed is free
But I am sick now, and my days are numbered
Come all you young men and lay me down

Celtic Woman,"'Tis the last rose of summer left blooming alone
All her lovely companions are faded and gone
No flower of her kindred, no rosebud is nigh
To reflect back her blushes and give sigh for sigh

I'll not leave thee, thou lone one, to pine on the stem
Since the lovely are sleeping, go sleep thou with them
Thus kindly I scatter thy leaves o'er the bed
Where thy mates of the garden lie scentless and dead

So soon may I follow when friendships decay
And from love's shining circle the gems drop away
When true hearts lie withered and fond ones are flown
Oh who would inhabit this bleak world alone?
This bleak world alone

As some fair woman, lost in cushions deep
With gentle hand caresses listlessly
The contour of her breasts before she sleeps
On velvet backs of avalanches soft
She often lies enraptured as she dies
And gazes on white visions aloft
Which like a blossoming to heaven rise
When sometimes on this globe, in indolence
She lets a secret tear drop down, by chance
A poet, set against oblivion
Takes in his hand this pale and furtive tear
This opal drop where rainbow hues appear
And hides it in his breast far from the sun

When the light begins to fade,
And shadows fall across the sea,
One bright star in the evening sky,
Your love's light leads me on my way.

There's a dream that will not sleep,
A burning hope that will not die.
So I must go now with the wind,
And leave you waiting on the tide.

Time to fly, time to touch the sky.
One voice alone - a haunting cry.
One song, one star burning bright,
Let it carry me through darkest night.

Rain comes over the grey hills,
And on the air, a soft goodbye.
Hear the song that I sing to you,
When the time has come to fly.

When I leave and take the wing,
And find the land that fate will bring,
The brightest star in the evening sky,
(Is your love far from me)
Is your love waiting far for me.

(oh)Is your love waiting far from me....




",The Soft Goodbye
Celtic Woman,"On the first day on January,
Eighteen ninety-two,
They opened Ellis island and they let
The people through.
And the first to cross the threshold
Of that isle of hope and tears,
Was Annie Moore from Ireland
Who was all of fifteen years.

Isle of hope, isle of tears,
Isle of freedom, isle of fears,
But it's not the isle you left behind.
That isle of hunger, isle of pain,
Isle you'll never see again
But the isle of home is always on your mind.

In a little bag she carried
All her past and history,
And her dreams for the future
In the land of liberty.
And courage is the passport
When your old world disappears
But there's no future in the past
When you're fifteen years

Isle of hope, isle of tears,
Isle of freedom, isle of fears,
But it's not the isle you left behind.
That isle of hunger, isle of pain,
Isle you'll never see again
But the isle of home is always on your mind.

When they closed down Ellis Island
In nineteen forty-three,
Seventeen million people
Had come there for sanctuary.
And in springtime when I came here
And I stepped onto it's piers,
I thought of how it must have been
When you're fifteen years.

Isle of hope, isle of tears,
Isle of freedom, isle of fears,
But it's not the isle you left behind.

Celtic Woman,"If you ever go across the sea to Ireland,
Then maybe at the closing of your day,
You can sit and watch the moon rise over Claddagh,
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay.

Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream,
The women in the meadow making hay,
Just to sit beside the turf fire in a cabin,
And watch the barefoot gosoons as they play.

Ooh

For the breezes blowing o'er the sea's from Ireland,
Are perfumed by the heather as they blow,
And the women in the uplands digging praties,
Speak a language that the strangers do not know.

Yet the strangers came and tried to teach us their ways,
And they scorned us just for being what we are,
But they might as well go chasin' after moon beams,
Or light a penny candle from a star.

And if there's gonna be a life here after,
And faith somehow I'm sure there's gonna be,
I will ask my God to let me make my Heaven,
In that dear land across the Irish sea.

Celtic Woman,"Goodnight my angel.
Time to close your eyes.
And save these questions for another day.
I think I know what you've been asking me.
I think you know what I've been trying to say.
I promise I would never leave you.
And you should always know, I never will be far away.

Goodnight my angel, now it's time to sleep.
And still so many things I want to say.
Remember all the songs you sang for me.
When we went sailing on a emerald bay.
And like a boat out on the ocean.
I'm rocking you to sleep.

The water is dark and deep inside this mother's heart.
You'll always be a part of me.
Goodnight my angel, now it's time to dream.
And dream how wonder your life will be.
Some day a child may cry and if you sing this lullaby.
Then in your heart there will always be a part of me.",Goodnight My Angel
Celtic Woman,"Where Lagan stream sings lullaby
There blows a lily fair
The twilight gleam is in her eye
The night is on her hair
And like a love-sick lennan-shee
She has my heart in thrall
Nor life I owe nor liberty
With love is lord of all.

And sometimes when the beetle's horn
Hath lulled the eve to sleep
I steal unto her shielding lorn
And through the dooring peep.
There on the cricket's singing stone,
She spares the bogwood fire,
And hums in sad sweet undertones
The song of heart's desire

The song of heart's desire.",My Lagan Love

Celtic Woman,"A spaceman came traveling on his ship from afar,

And over a village he halted his craft,
And it hung in the sky like a star, just like a star,

He followed a light, and came down to a shed,
Where a mother and child were lying there on a bed,
A bright light of silver shone round his head,
And he had the face of an angel, and they were afraid,

Then the stranger spoke, he said, ""do not fear,
I come from a planet a long way from here,
And I bring a message for mankind to hear"",
And suddenly the sweetest music, filled the air,

And it went la la la la la la la la la la,
La la la la la la laaaa, la la la la la la la la la la,
Peace and goodwill to all men, and love for the child,

This lovely music went trembling through the ground,
And many were awakened on hearing that sound,
And travelers on the road the village they found,
By the light of that ship in the sky,
Which shone all around,

And just before dawn, at the paling of the sky,
The stranger returned and said ""now I must fly,
When two thousand years of your time has gone by,
This song will begin once again, to a baby's cry"",

And it went la la la la la la la la la la,

Sister, brother, mother, father
It's time to stem the flow of blood
Lying frosted on these city walls
Burnt out cars in the parking lots
Are the tribal symbols of our streets
A young recruit still the age of innocence
Swears allegiance to his beliefs
So give us love and understanding
Give us hope that's never ending
And to the faithful, now departed
May you rest in peace, may you never be forgotten
To the children of tomorrow
May the final act and triumph of our will
Be your walk to freedom
A missing face in the family portrait
A hoard of memories on the mantle piece
Outside a patriotic speech
Falls upon the lips of angry men
So give us love and understanding
Give us hope that's never ending

Now I'm wide awake, I'm not sleeping, oh no
And this room feels like a cage, driving me crazy
And I wish I could be there upon your pillow
I can recognize the silence
As it hangs endlessly on line
And the words never spoken
Seem so little yet means so much

Incessant chase after the unknown.

I can grasp this thin border between the dew.
Over the green grass
Whisper of the distant trees.
Between the glow of sun
And the shadows over the dead mouth.

You're such an inspiration for the ways 
That I'll never ever choose to be 
Oh so many ways for me to show you 
How the savior has abandoned you fuck your God 
Your Lord and your Christ 
He did this 
Took all you had and 
Left you this way 
Still you pray, you never stray 
Never taste of the fruit 
You never thought to question why 
It's not like you killed someone 
It's not like you drove a hateful spear into his side 
Praise the one who left you 
Broken down and paralyzed 
He did it all for you 
He did it all for you 
Oh so many many ways for me to show you 
How your dogma has abandoned you 
Pray to your Christ, to your god 
Never taste of the fruit 
Never stray, never break 
Never, choke on a lie 
Even though he's the one who did this to you 
You never thought to question why 
Not like you killed someone 
It's not like you drove a spiteful spear into his side 
Talk to Jesus Christ 
As if he knows the reasons why
He did it all for you 
Did it all for you He did it all for you

Metaphor for a missing moment 
Pull me into your perfect circle 
One womb 
One shape One resolve Liberate this will To release us all Gotta cut away, clear away Snip away and sever this Umbilical residue that's Keeping me from killing you And from pulling you down with me in here I can almost hear you scream Give me One more medicated peaceful moment One more medicated peaceful moment And I don't wanna feel this overwhelming Hostility Because I don't wanna feel this overwhelming Hostility Gotta cut away Clear away Snip away and sever this Umbilical residue Gotta cut away Clear away Snip away and sever this Umbilical residue that's Keeping me from killing you Keeping me from killing you

Come lie with me
Make good with love
It's better than envy

Oh I'm soft in the middle
Still hurting a little
All I wanted was for you
To lay in my arms arms
And show me what good Lovin' can do

So kiss me goodnight
I'm suddenly suddenly tired
Let the sun go down on me and you, we've got the time
And truth be told
I've been sad and lonely,
I've been sad and lonely too",Caught in the Middle

And left me there to drift away

I woke up in the morning 
Stripped of everything
Oh sweet lord its time its time 
We moved along
Tonight I'll put the good
Back in goodbye

If the boat don't float and she don't go
This girls gonna blow the morning
I'll turn to face the cold cold sea
And will this ship around
And I'll swallow level tears 
Of broken promises

But the calm prevailed with 
No whistle to her name
And I could see whose name 
Was on your mind
I heard sighs from a million muted
Turncoats at attention
And tonight I'll put the good 
Back in goodbye

If the boat don't float and she don't go
This girls gonna blow the morning
I'll turn to face the cold cold sea 
And will this ship around
And swallow level tears 
Of broken promises

What freedom owes the devil 
To the devil I'll be due
I'll walk right down to hell before 
I fall in love with you
I'll take this broken heart of mine 
And pin it to the floor
And tonight ill put the good 
Back in goodbye

Sun burns, stars earn shadows,
sing baby brown eyes
You give me everything to try
I'm following grey skies, grey
Skies lead me lost in the night

We'll dance till were tired
Eat till were full
With a guaranteed window over some where to go
My room needs no 4 walls to cushion the blow, lets go

Maybe you're right maybe I'm wrong
Climb till your pacified
Fight till your strong

We'll dance till were tired
Eat till were full
With a guaranteed window over some where to go
My room needs no 4 walls to cushion the blow, lets go

We'll talk till were empty drink till were blue
You can dare me to race you you can pay me my dues
Your maybe's no answer, 'cause maybe its you, lets go

Dance till were tired eat till were strong
A guaranteed window where nothing can go wrong

Cerys Matthews,"Rain fell; it called off play
We ran for shelter
Laughing at the stormy weather
Jack sang bread of heaven
And I thought of you

One sweet day, finally, we'll trace each other
Shine a little light together
Till that day I hear you though you're faraway

I'll walk the earth to find you
And wrap my arms around you
And sing the sweetest songs for you

In all good time we'll come across a mountain haven
Build a house and home and settle
Plant some crops, and pray they'll grow for me and you

Who's to say we might wander in the trees
And shimmer under canopies of autumn's
Rich kaleidoscope of gold and ruby?

I'll walk the earth to find you
And wrap my arms around you
And sing the sweetest words for you

And as for stormy weather
We'll be so good together
I've got to find my way to you

Here and now, the rain's still falling steadily
The damp is crawling up to me, and
Jacks is singing all your favorite melodies

Soon enough I fall into an easy sleep
Now, no one move and no one speak
Let the moonlight carry from me from here to you

I'll walk the earth to find you
Wrap my arms around you
And sing the sweetest songs for you

And as for stormy weather
We'll be so good together
I've got to find a way to you",Louisiana
Cerys Matthews,"Two ships passing in the night
Drop an anchor for a while
We'll share some company
We're the same you and me
It's in the air that we breathe
And there's no shame

Wide is the ocean
Sweet Gravity

And beneath the evening sun
If there's work to be done
I shall not falter
Swell shell ease
Swell she'll rise
I?ll take my seat there by your side
You won me over

Wide is the ocean, I long to follow,

A time and a place for everything

The moon will not roam

Cerys Matthews,"Only a fool to stick by your side

Struck by your change of heart
Straight into your arms
Like a newborn child
Straight into those open arms

I'm only a fool to stick by your side
Struck by your change of heart
Every day and every night
Try as I might
You're my black and you're my white

I've got eyes on you
Like you want me to

So I creep by your side no great surprise
All for your sweet surrender
The morning stands still
Won't let me in
And nobody hears me try

I need you, I need you
Oh I need you
Like I need salt in my water-
Salt in my wounds ,but I stay
'cause I'm only a fool
To stick by your side
Struck by that changing heart

Straight into your arms,
Your broken arms
Straight into your open arms,
I never look behind
'cause I'm only a fool,
I'm only a fool



",Only a Fool
Cerys Matthews,"We stopped for coffee in the redwood forest
Giant dripping leaves, spoons of powdered cream
I wanted to kiss you, but I wasn't sure how
Like those Indians lost in the rain forest

Forced to drag burning wood wherever they went
They had had all forgotten how to light a fire

That's why people OD on pills
And jump from the golden gate bridge
Anything to feel weightless again

Those poor lost Indians when the white men found them
Most died of TB, the rest went insane
In our motel room you were drinking slice and gin
Reading Moby Dick on the other bed

Remember the first time we slept together
You said it felt like when you learn to float

That's why people OD on pills
And jump from the golden gate bridge
Anything to feel weightless again",Weightless Again
Cerys Matthews,"I took a ride on your fingertips
Heaven high with the thrill of it
And in your eyes for a moment
Its like we never said goodbye
We took a walk for the hell of it
And we talk through the thick of it
And in your eyes for a moment
Its like we never said good bye

But something went wrong
You never came home
And time takes so long
What are these tears we're crying

'Cos I remember the open roads
Met at the corner where no one goes
And no one mattered at all
And I remember the driving rain
Soaked to the skin these were perfect days
And I remember it all

Friend is such a horrid word
Is it at home with the thing we learned
You didn't phone
And in a different world
We'd have never said goodbye

Where are we going with feeling alone
Time takes so long
And what are these tears were crying

'cos I remember the open roads
Met at the corner where no one goes
And no one mattered at all
And I remember the driving rain
Soaked to the skin these were perfect days
And I remember it all

And as for then and as for now
As for who and as for how
There's just one thing I cant forget
How beautiful you are",Open Roads
Ces Cru,"Another day in the life, no time for play I'm tryin' to cake,
High stakes survival, increasing my fire rate
Eyes dilated, aim my sight fly straight
If I ever want my record to see the light of day
I'mma find a way, weight of the world need a lift
If we carry bags I know we gon' need a tip,
You're free to give my man but I don't need a disk,
With the grip of tracks, it's really nothing for me to skip,
We the creed of a better breed and you never read and
Since you never see it son that's, if'n you ever see us,
My nemesis, while you bein' a Ebenezer
I’ll be seein' sights sippin on somethin' with señoritas,
Pro-political peace, let 'em read
With a Palestinian, Israeli or Lebanese,
Behold the horse I'm paler to ever be
I'm tryin' to catch some while I'm sailing the seven seas
I float my friends, scuttle my enemies and we
Constantly in the struggle for energy,
I rock steadily in the spot ready or not
Pushin' my pronouns for plenty plenty a pop,
I'm getting guap my man I got plans
To cop land away and lay in in the hot sand,
I 'Know the Ledge' and I'm, playin' my Roxanne,
Another dollar another day in the rock band,
It's juice!

Give me, give me, give me the juice
Give me, give me, give me the juice

Crawling out of a casket, I woke from madness,
I've been in the media feeding off the sadness,
If any an enemy coming rattling as if,
He ready for Armageddon now wet him in acid
I've been in the back bitch, playing the sidekick
Surprised they realize the size of my dick,
They blog and criticize the lines of my shit,
Straddle up on a iron alone and you ride dick,
Better get him a stretcher, an oxygen mask,
Socks and gym bags, box of Slim Fast,
I lose dead weight, got a lot to get past,
For all that hate, I'm about to get cash,
I ain't got a chain yet, you're hearing the same vet,
Could say that I'm lucky I made it out of a train wreck,
Want me to speed it up motherfucker it ain't Tech
It's Godemis idiots study up on on the name check
I zone in the canvas, I'm in the paint, they ain't ready
I spray seven or eight I'm alive to aim steady
It's like me and Jason using the same 'chete
So 'Raw' I'm 'Delirious' nigger it ain't Eddie!
It don't matter I don't chatter at all to y'all,
The new data is out of an old catalog,
The instinct is that of an old rabid dog,
Who might have been good on that day, but he got it all
That's juice!

Give me, give me, give me the juice
Give me, give me, give me the juice

Wakin' him up, shakin' the fuck
Outta Pagans that are mating fornicatin'
With hate and sick lust,
Eatin' bloody steak and bacon with Satan
They can abrup-tly be taken by Yates
And I'm placin' this blade in his guts,
Amazing to us sleknov raisin' a cup here's to,
Layin' the blade today who bathin' in blood Bedlam,
Might behead ya psyches dead for life he bled
But Ike said to knife these Negras!
Bright ran away for the night I'm a sinner
Hate my inner light when I stray see the fright,
I generate, I innovate in the fight I'mma incinerate a mic!
Men obey when I write they disintegrate
It's over, soul of a soldier
Chose to be cold and overload ya with vulgar
S'posed to be old but the flows gettin' bolder
And hoes lose they clothes never holdin' they composure

Someday we’ll be free and take control

Wake your mind up, you feel the earth spinnin?
You heard your voice was insignificant, I heard different
Committed people change the world even in small groups
It’s the only way that it happens man it’s all truth
John Lennon knew it, and Martin Luther knew it
The truth is you find it inside the heart of any human
So if you’re ready do it unlock it and set it free
Rest in peace, Jack and Bobby Kennedy, let it be
Where did Amphetamine originate? It’s man made
The war on drugs is just a motherfuckin band aid
And you’ve been fed lies, caught up in the head lights
I’m bout to break bad, Walter White tread light
Waitin at red lights, sit for the control system
Heroin addicts smack their arm and go to soul prison
Discard a dream for that sweet fix, feed addiction
And we don’t read directions, … or need prescriptions

I hear a motherfucker cussin' and such
And when I love on somethin' I love on it much too much
For your love I'm such a sucker punches bust my shit
I'm waking up to lumps, I'm wonderin' what the fuck I did
And for your punishment, I am a gluten feed me please
You never met anybody hungry as me believe
I'm taking licks, sores bleed on my face from kicks
Gettin' a taste of what it's like to be replaced so quick
Give me a break you're here today and gone the next
They call it wanderlust, I'm wishin' you would wander less
I try to stay strong, calm my stress
Play along but it's out of balance all a mess
And weighed it wrong, chess game
Either take the queen, or play the pawn

We're not gonna take shit, may work or it may not
We comin' in harmony, in rhythm with fate's clock
We take it at our pace, and if the brakes lock
I got you, you got me, inside a heart-shaped box
I'm not gonna force it, got nothing to force with
We smash when it's crunch time, unable to forfeit
It's good but of course it, may even be tested
You bring the best out me, the worst is reflected

Yeah, she has a certain affect, I put in the work and I sweat
But it's worth all the stress if I lay with her when I rest
This love burnin' my chest, I stop searchin' for sex
What she got I never found in any person I met
In the blink of an eye it all turned to a mess
I'm tryna iron out the kinks first, permanent press
Give me the courage to jet
I'm hangin' onto every word that I get
But truthfully, I haven't heard from her...yet

The streets are red, runnin with the blood of non-believers
So play your part I’ll make a star out of a bottom feeder
The romans fell under his knife but made a God of Caesar
For every Caesar there’s a Brutus with a blade of steel
For every offense there’s a defense ‘til I break the shield
For every fake a real, I guess that my fate is sealed
I’m drivin drunk off a power trip somebody take the wheel
Told travel light, what you hold will weigh you down
Big noise, Bob Dylan, you don’t make a sound
The golden truth, motherfucker I don’t roll with mute
Show and prove yourself, fuck am I supposed to do?
EPMD, teach a man to fish
Learn from me only if you seek advantages
Complaints about the game? You need to speak with management
Best crew, Ces Cru it seems to be unanimous
I’m out for action what the fuck are y’all about relaxin?
They doubt my sanity but they could never doubt my passion
I don’t know why they deceive us, feed us lies mislead us
He who denies what he has seen is worse than blind believers
I just play the cards the way they’re dealt
It’s hard enough to change the world I’m tryin' to change myself
The choice is this: except your conditions as they exist
Or accept responsibility and change the shit

She handed me my change after I completed my purchase
I thought of spitting game but I managed to fight the urges
I said it must be strange for you all alone on the surface
She said it was a curse to be perfect without a purpose
Feeling nervous, I stepped in the opposite direction
Her comment resonated, I tried to sever connection
Is this a twist of fate with some karma and misdirection?
I’m standing in the mirror still looking for my reflection
What am I trying to say rocking all this ink on my body?
I’m King, Hathaway, Donnie, most people know me as Godi
It’s ill though, I kick it like Fei Long with a steel toe
They run amuck and couldn’t give a fuck with a dildo
For real bro, my hater scoping' Dumbdar's been on
So I don’t give a bloody fuck who’s dropping the N bomb
We bout to shake it up till the planes fall
Then cut through all the tension y’all invent with a chainsaw
Is that a threat? No it’s a request
To be correct it's a requirement, you’re fucking with Ces
And if you try to fix your place to say that we ain’t the best
It might as well be tryna work a deal with nothing for less
And I’m up in the nest
Never depressed I'm pressin' my tears
Conquering fears, and never cave in from the pressure of peers
Swilling my beers while telling Jehovah to thank heaven
All I need is six addy’s, a shot, and a tank seven
Tell a bitch I am dynamite, she might blow me
And the shit I’m snorting is China white just like OT
Pardon my passion, it feels like I’m ripping my OG
My [?] will K I M the day that I OD

Ces Cru,"Ayo what up though, What you lookin at?
Took it from us and got pissed when we took it back
You pickin up what I dropped? They can’t hold us
I’m plottin on whatever you got now hand over
Give it to me

Praise goals, pay tolls, only if you play it pro player
That’s the way it goes, ain’t nothin to say no more
Seated at a feast, took a plate, only ate a roll
Felt regret, hunger that I kept would save me later though
Fire burned in my belly, everywhere that I would turn
I was met with adversity and from that fire I emerged
Pain I felt along the way, never made it my concern
Took it as a lesson to the game and let the tires burn
Gas out, gassed up, bout to pass the past up
This for every faggot battle rapper that harassed us
Hard work added up, perseverance paid off
Independent underground, grindin with no days off
Play the boss pay the cost, rather than stay lost
Now I need that prime cut, slathered in steak sauce
Matter fact I’m takin all of that, then I’ll take more
Livin in the moment what you waitin for? Good lord KC
While you been acting like some poor babies
I get it crackin never relaxin doin my chores daily
You got a fine wine well then my rhyme is the gourmet cheese
Follow your guideline I’m in my prime you’ve been warned take heed
I’ve got a list of accolades that I don’t have to say
And I ain't talkin now, I’m talkin way back in the day
Add it up to now for real it’s still nothin to me
I’m finna top that, man I got that y’all ain't fuckin with me boy!!

Ain't nothin' changed, I still arrange to pack up in the civic
The frame of mind is ain't nobody fucking with the clinic
Ironically enough, you fuck with us and get the d-dick
Ya dig it? The faction back in action spinnin' Riddick
Oh is it common knowledge I commit on the pivot?
Killin' it, put on a show then we come in and steal it
Feelin' it, we bout to go bananas can you peel it?
Cause U-B-I and Godi's like canvas and acrylic
But we don't know no limits, roll the credits it's finished
Sit home and watch a chain, if they complain, I change the image
Heard opportunity knockin', hopped in the cockpit
Just another pissed pilot who's ready to drop ship
If death is certain, that means the reaper is lurkin'
And his cousin sleep is creepin in while we closin' the curtain
I'm workin' a fuckin' miracle out of the situation
To knock it back out of orbit and blitz the administration
So what do you want from ya dude, I gotta be ruder than Jude
The second I enter ya loo, we comin' to Rubik's ya cube
They lookin' at me like I'm food, been hurtin' to get em a meal
They wanna know steps that I took, been tryin' to get em a deal
Behold the murderous Hanzhong
I bring the death star to any planet ya land on
The prettiest in pink, I think you stuck on that Cam'ron
With orange mocha frappe chinos and a man pawn, bitch

I’m full of hope, yes, truer than a motherfucker
I’m full of smoke, yes, cooler than a motherfucker
Flying through the Midi, the most hated in my city
Couldn’t give a bloody fuck, look up, I keep these feelings with me
If a hater marks a hickey, I’m a target come and stick me
I can pick a chick apart so if she starts to acting picky
I be rolling up that sticky while I’m throwing up them deuces
Just a slave to the rhythm, neck inside of seven nooses
I ain’t calling him a racists, if you thought so you’s a dummy
Death is chasing me while I pursue this money, kind of funny
It’s a sunny day in Killer City, if you feel it split a philly
Skip it, you can feel it with me
Ces about to kill it, really

I’m about to take what’s mine, I’m a let them take it easy
Take your time I’ll give you space and take your place on TV
It’s give and take I’m chasin cheese but that don’t make me greedy
If you don’t give a fuck they’ll rape you and then take it freely
Let’s celebrate graffiti fuck it elevate the needy
If only it was that simple to sell a crate of CD’s
Let’s keep it relevant, how well equipped am I
They debate the creation of my intelligent design
I tried to told em but they didn’t listen, It’s tougher
To sit in prison then deal with reality and big decisions
Bottled your instinct and slept on intuition
The reason I Stevie Wondered about your depth of inner vision
My dreams manifest that’s divination
I’m overwhelmed with possibility
You’re stressed about your limitations
It’s all about the mindstate you stay in
If you don’t like it change the situation

Nobody’s knockin I can chill got me feelin good

Mayday and Ces, they got about a pound, you heard this?
Your whiskey glass half empty? Well fuck a sermon
Better call your bartender till your throat starts hurting
Until it’s burning, the shit’s working
Riding down the district, causing nothing but mischief
Bass so heavy you flinching, just to get some attention
Some girls in every direction, thinking the future’s ours
Had to bottle this instant, just to sell it to y’all
An enemy of the system for putting it in your system
Yeah it’s stranger than fiction, still we cutting it raw
Our products flooding the streets and it’s starting to float abroad

Staggerin', slack-jawed, wear a pair of shoe if it fits

Was backyard boogie down? Everybody parachuted and split

The fuck is more therapeutic than this? I give thanks where due
It's nothing more, if you were legit then I thank you
Now you Mr. Manipulation ain't it a bitch that I came to?
I’ve done a dozen things you did in a day

On a beach, gonna reach lot of peaks, I skeet then I wanna go sleep

And satisfied until somebody else step in our place
You said we would be the best of friends, friendship can change
Now we're spitting at each other like some venomous snakes
We go to war and then forgive, but can't forget the mistakes
When you in love, you stick together, do whatever it takes
I'm sayin', I'm feeling high and then I get set in my place

Over a little time you became a permanent fixture
We perfected the mixture, read each other the scripture
Out of the blue I knew what was happening, wasn't quick ta
Say that I had an issue, I deaded communication
You became even colder because of the situation
Hatching to you was facing a breakup or separation
Told her this could occur, you preferred to get next to Jason
And forget information, I wasn't chasing you down
Open to making up the breakup if only you down
Yeah if only you down, yeah if only you down

I play my part to make a change while you aim at my heart
From day-to-day you created your mark, bae
Illuminate the way, I'm too afraid of the dark
I'm hardly speaking to you, communication is sparse, hello?
You make it hard, I mean it's difficult, boo
For me to move on in my life while I be trippin' off you
(Sick as the witches with the wickedest brew
No I don't mind 'cause most the time she make it do what it do

I let 'em know I'm doing everything you can't see
And homie you don't want no problems, you get one chance
We ain't even thinking bout repping where we from fam
They wanna hang with us, wishing they came with us
Let's keep it real, we ain't even in the same bidness
This entertainment, the money, power, and fame bidness
It's same same, while they thinking it's the same difference

Yeah, y'all got it, y'all run it
That's what you already don't know
Your turn, we're on it
That's what you already don't know

Ay, better find out, that boy that ticket to kick it

My lip is like a hundred round clip
Enough to make another nigga turn around
I wish he could just turn around and dip
Suicide but I'm a turn the gun around
And you bother nobody
Blazing some CES, Ubi, Godi
And I'm rocking with the KOD he
Got me a check for my rap, money

Ces Cru,"I'm aware that right now a lot of us feel like chips are down
Sick of bein' kicked around
Thrown on the ground, picked right back up then tossed in the lost and found
Stumblin', lost your ground but it sounds like a chance for you to recover quickly
If you know anything about a struggle at all, the hustle is real, you probably already get me
So I need all of you with me
The Killer City committee, the Middi West version
Of the Avengers goin' harder than Bobby and Whitney
The enemy's shifty, so we gotta react swiftly
Whenever negativity hit me, I try to get it in check quickly
Came to know playing the role of a psycho is not gon' fit me
Cause I'm not so fifty, but I do know this
We all have the power, in every moment the time is ours
Counting minutes, seconds, hours
Death to cowards, fight the power
Smite the lions, light the fires -
Brighter, higher, 'till we burn 'em down
Take the tables that we turn around
It's worth the search if freedom's found
(And you're a hero)

What we need is a hero
Someone who's always strong
A source of light when things go wrong
What we need is a, hero
Who's always there to take flight
Who can mend our wounds and defends our rights
What we need is a hero
Someone prepared to lead the way
Who can brave our world and save our day
Hero, who always knows what to do
Someone like me
Someone like you
What we need is a hero

I watch it all unfold, and then I take my chosen road
This one goes out to everybody livin' state to state, place to place, and coast to coast
They're ridin' in, committin' acts of violence that leave us divided, you can take your own control
The kids lookin' up to us for guidance, now they wanna try it, how were they supposed to know?
It's like we all wanna fly (Uh), nobody wanna phone on the line but
Sometimes you gotta swallow your pride and apologize
For all of the time you were wrong and cauterized the wounds that we harbor inside (Uh)
Ain't nobody perfect, we need to organize the community, stop living like Lord of the Fly
I know it might seem hard, it's important to try to keep a light on and centered at the core of your life
Go to war with a mic
Shoot 'em down with a peace sign
The system of control is an intelligent design
It need a second look, and many elements refined
We're lookin' for a hero that can help us defeat crime and settle the beef
If you only throw a rock at police lined, you're really not a rebel to me
It isn't us vs. them, we all one, stand together in unity better than lyin' dead in the street

Break it down, roll it up, Philly weed and shake

My hat's off, better get your facts all straight
Before you get figured out and get black balled (HEYY)
I see you runnin' like a track star
Too bad you run in a circle around in the backyard
It's like nobody did ever listen to Black Star
And if they did they probably thought it was whack bars
I guess they too cool for school they act dumb
And sell the venom to kids and get 'em a fat sum

Listen up and everybody soundin' like clowns
They never had a rhyme nor a reason
The roof is on fire everybody leavin'
The air is still and it got everybody wheezin'
I got the keys keys keys got the keys keys keys
Which means I be gone for the weekend
These idiots be acting like I ain't got it when I always had it
Been at it with a pad and a pen and it never mattered the patterns
I was developin' hell I been a veteran long as a lot of y'all walkin' the planet and
I don't need an automatic I'm doing this out of habit, you silly rabbit
Anybody can have it if you in it then grab it, do it good as the baddest
Take a look at the status yeah it's Godi doin' the Hammerdance
Go ahead and forfeit you never had a chance
They holla at us and we answer with an avalanche
I'm going Super Saiyan stayin' in a battle stance
Kamehameha flying out of both of my hands

Passion'll splash the page, peer pressure I'll pack it on
Rolling with CES I got the unity
They waiting on breakups holding ya breath
Well stop it, you can breathe
So in the best of my community, my vocal open up global investment opportunities
Nobody guessed that I would do these things
Manifested my destiny, acting out my lucid dreams
I see you overly stressed about your moody ring
Run the jewelry while these rappers acting like beauty queens
Nobody messing with the U to B, I to the Q-U-I to the T-O
To the U to the S to the death copy
I'm what they thought was humanly
Possible Rocko popping locking they shot then shoot at please
Put no stock in your flock of scrutiny
Officer of chopping hip hop I could talk it fluently
It's not what you thought
They thought they could out-maneuver me
Drop it like it's hot so I pop at your top while you asleep

Skill is a weapon I test in a millisecond
And you will accept it the catastrophic event specialists
Emerge from the rubble CES settle the mess
Rebel on mesh, metal and flesh, peddling death

From my perspective the path to freedom is clear to see
This one is for the Nesha ignore it living in fear to be
Trump's a modded model of Hillary
Cause both of them do dirt and have zero accountability
Swear they could never care bout a G
They drunk off chugging powers they paying the cowards salary
Fuck how you see it, we need to face it for how it be
Cause man created laws that were never based in morality
If you fucking suck, you should swallow
The best crew is the CES Cru and yes you can trust the motto
I do the devil's work twice as much as you follow
Cause U-B-I and Godi's like Tyson and Cus D'amato
Baddest duo you know I'm spitting facts
Take whatever's dissing my mission's getting this shit to crack
Keep a grammar Glock on my person merkin' with different gats
Cause nowadays these rappers I'm hearing seem to forget to rap

Turning little shit into big things
Pain Bruce Wayne meets Bane, that means I'll clip ya wings
Back cracking still backpacking raps slacking
Played out like white tees and snap rapping
Laffy taffy in baggy jeans
It's over for 'em they crying Jordan I mean the saddest meme
Beat drops for them beatbox
My silly thugs take billy clubs and then they beat cops
Non violence a non issue I don't agree
Stressing in the streets protesting, oh no that won't be me
Shoot first, we shoot back homie with buzzer beaters

Sight beyond sight, touch beyond touch
You can get a feel for what's beyond us
Everything you hearing, not really what you heard
Men and women lie so really what's the word
If I'm lying and I'm dying, a killer must emerge
Fill a bust to burst 'til I'm feeling up to purge
See the world is yours and it ain't hard to tell
Look up in the sky, you can start to smell
Smoke in the air, smoke smoke in the lung
Nobody should ever fly this close to the sun
Wings melted down, flesh felt the burn
Tumble to the ground with no self concern
Kill an Afghani man or go help the curd
Earn a purple heart if you don't go to hell first
Win a Pulitzer or a Nobel prize but they won't tell why
They let those shells fly
Got a cosell sign, cosign to sell
Sell 'em like phosphorous both sides'll fail
Young men die while the old timers help themselves
Staking power but only time will tell
Terminate terrorists override the cell
Fore a state fell, the government backoo
Marine coming home, he covered in tattoo
Stuck in the past, post traumatic Iraq mood
Iraq's not Iraq, it's really Iraq fool
Lieutenants say they're pulling the pilly to pop dudes
And citizens in the inner city can not move

When I hit 'em with the motherfucking facts now
Bringing everything to light with the universal might
So for anybody saving in the background
Fuck pigs with a passion for blasting my nade
Ain't even put my brother through a proper pat down
How I know I'm finna crack has been a matter of fact
They could never see the signal when I crackdown
Then now we got 'em murdering the track down
We need a reason for they why he had to clap rounds
These pigs get to go ahead to pop while
We put them in power they only wanna act out
Crack files in the pound by the trap house
Is open twenty four seven, how they rap 'bout
Bee-gees go to be the heat with that clout
He breaking even he don't need to get the cash out
I'm figuring I'm in the middle of a war zone
They come in weather or not if anyone's home
I don't imagine they could win a war with no clones
They got a pin on everybody with a go phone
You might as well be a middle man in the midi
A black cloud's covering every bit of the city
You never see us coming together and it's a pity
We all pissed off, the situation is shitty
See we need to band together, swear to never run
No retreat and no surrender when whoever come
Fighting for freedom is a battle that ain't ever done

Claim they can hang, we're like gyro

One in a million will not rock boats

Running out of gas, you could give me yo lane
I'm a do it for the average Jimmy Joe Jane
I'm doing great, got my syllables straight
Turn a rapper yellow with the killer cold play
Feeling myself, they be feeling old age
I strip away they ego, I don't need a codename
Mister billion a, really don't play
Augment a intellect silicone brain
Numbing up my nerve now I'm feeling no pain
Loading up a gun but will it go bang

Are you serious, I'm doing just fine
I was living down low, you was up high
From the underground now we're moving up, climb
I'm a drop another album do it up fly

Take a va-cay, I never been to Maui
Never dream about sleep, but I'm feeling drowsy

Laugh now but y'all dogs better rabie up

Fools forget to play still chasing dollar bills
I'm feeling great fail if you cruising it's a race

And every lake is just as bad, I can't look past the traffic jam
Test the rappers they won't ever pass the class exam
Blazing like I lit a match and had a can of gas in hand
You make me mad on stage, I'll backhand a bitch like afro man
Snap a wrench in half and discipline you like a kid again

Get off your iPhone, boy I'm in the rhyme zone
Walking over pine-cones shining like a rhinestone

We ain't rocking with you clowns never no more
It's going down a level, CES is on that deep shit
Tidal wavy so that shady gotta drown slow
I'm telling whoever could ever keep a secret

You only care about yourself and that's weak shit

César Costa,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura
Cesar Marquez,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear

A te procurar

Vou de novo pro meu quarto
Vou te amar da minha janela

Come sei brava tu a colpire
Quante parole sai trovare
Mentre io non so che dire
Le tue parole sono mine
Le sento esplodere in cortile
Al posto delle margherite, ora 
Ci sono cariche esplosive
Due lunghe e romantiche vite
Divise da queste rime

Le tue labbra stanno male, lo so
Non hanno labbra da mangiare
Oh ma la fame d'amore la si può 
Curare, dannazione!
Con le parole, sì, che fanno male
Fanno sanguinare 
Ma non morire

Ah, le tue parole sono mine
Le sento esplodere in cortile
Al posto delle margherite, ora 
Ci sono cariche esplosive

Ah, due lunghe e romantiche vite
Due lunghe e romantiche vite divise

Cesare Cremonini,"Dico sempre che non cerco amore

Piango ogni notte
Sempre per lei 
Vieni a vedere perché

Dico sempre che odio l'amore 
Che non mi serve a niente però 
Prego perché, il Signore lo sa
Che prima o poi lo troverò

Voglio che tutto intorno ci sia solo la vita per me 
Voglio te, notte e giorno, devo convincerti che

Capirai che il cielo è bello perché 
In fondo fa da tetto a un mondo pieno di paure e lacrime 
E piangerai, oh altroché! 
Ma dopo un po' la vita ti sembrerà più facile
E così fragile, ricomincerai 

C'è chi rinuncia all'amore 
Solo perché non ne ha avuto mai 
Eccomi qua, dammelo e poi 
Ora capisci perché 
Dico sempre che odio l'amore 
Che non mi serve a niente però 
Prego perché, il Signore lo sa
Che prima o poi lo troverò 

Voglio che, tutto intorno, ci sia solo la vita per me
Voglio te, fino in fondo, devo convincerti che

Capirai che il cielo è bello perché 
In fondo fa da tetto a un mondo pieno di paure e lacrime
Oh, e piangerai, oh, altroché!

Cesare Cremonini,"Che tu sia figlio di un re o capo di stato
Che tu sia buono come il pane, o brutto e maleducato
Che tu sia pazzo o normale, gatto oppure cane
Guardia o ladro, non importa se sei fatto o ubriaco
Puoi chiamarti dottore, puoi chiamarti scienziato
Puoi chiamarti ufficiale, puoi chiamarti soldato
Puoi persino morire
Comunque l'amore è là dove sei pronto a soffrire
Lasciando ogni cosa al suo posto e partire
Anche tu come me

Che giri a destra o a sinistra, vero o per finta
È così, la tua impressione è solo un punto di vista
E non importa quale donna sposi o come si chiama
Ciò che hai fatto in questa vita e in una vita passata
Puoi chiamarti dottore, puoi chiamarti scienziato
Puoi cambiare il tuo cognome e usare un nome inventato
Puoi persino morire
Comunque l'amore è là dove sei pronto a soffrire
Lasciando ogni cosa al suo posto e partire
Anche tu come me
L'amore soltanto l'amore può farti guarire
Anche tu come me

Comunque vada, che tu sia Dolce o Gabbana
Che tu sia figlio di una guerra santa, giusta o sbagliata
Non importa se dormi in una villa o per strada
Che tu sia uomo, donna, frocio, Lucio Dalla o Sinatra
Puoi chiamarti dottore, puoi chiamarti scienziato
Puoi chiamarti ufficiale, puoi chiamarti soldato
Puoi persino morire
L'amore soltanto l'amore può farti guarire

Cesare Cremonini,"Chi sei?
Amore buongiorno
Quando ti levi di torno non vedo l'ora
Che esci e non torni più
Il amore sei tu,
Sei la donna che voglio,
Vorrei dirti parole d'amore
Ma forse a parlare sei più brava tu
Ti va un'altra GreyGoose?

Accendiamo un film porno?
Già ti vedo vestita di rosa,
Ti comprerò casa, sei tu la mia sposa
Ma scendi più giù, vieni a darmi il buongiorno

La notte è già finita Angelina
Ma tu sei così bella Angelina
Presentami un'amica Angelina
Mi basta non sapere
Chi sei

Amore buongiorno
Ti ho amata dal primo momento, da quando mi hai detto
Somigli a mio padre, il tuo nome qual è?
Ti porto nel bosco
Ti giuro non sono ubriaco
Se guido non bevo, domani lavoro
Va un'altra GreyGoose

Tra poco fa giorno
La festa è finita, si torna alla vita
Ti chiamerò un giorno d'estate o magari mai più

Amore buongiorno

Il trucco è già sbiadito Angelina
Ma tu sei così bella Angelina
Non so quello che dico Angelina
Mi basta non sapere
Chi sei

Tornando a casa stasera ho capito che
Cercandomi nel buio pensavo ancora a te
Nella luce dei lampioni ti ho rivisto ancora
L'amore non viene mai una volta sola

La notte è già finita
La notte è già finita
La notte è già finita",GreyGoose

E' tutto quello che so
Per ogni domanda componi un verso
Non siamo soli in questo universo

Logico sì, è Logico
Per tutti persino per te
Ragazza dagli occhi caleidoscopio
Solo la luce corre nel vuoto

Non succede quasi mai a due come noi
Di Credere che sia possibile trovare
Un complice in questo disordine
Tracciare un'orbita nell'atmosfera

Amore mio la logica non è sincera
Chissà se amare è una cosa vera

Logico, sì è Logico
Non chiedersi come e perché
All you need is love
Mind Games and I Love Her
E' solo musica e fibre nervose

Non succede quasi mai a due come noi
Di Credere che sia possibile trovare
Un complice in questo disordine
Tracciare un'orbita nell'atmosfera

Amore mio la logica non è sincera
Siamo molecole oltre le nuvole
Corsie chilometriche
Raggi di luce, di bombe atomiche
Pronte ad esplodere

Stasera la logica non è sincera
Chissà se amare è una cosa vera
Chissà se amare è una cosa vera

Cesare Siepi,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine","Begin the beguine, song (from ""Jubilee"")"
Cesare Siepi,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.","I've got you under my skin, song (from the film ""Born to Dance"")"
Cesare Siepi,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night","In the still of the night, song (from ""Rosalie"")"
Cesare Siepi,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby
You'd be all my heart could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon shining above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love","You'd be so nice to come home to, song (from ""Something to Shout About"""

She think I like homie, putting her ice-grill on me
Nice build on him, and I might feel naughty
But I feel for him, when it's said too fake
Now he throwing me light meals when he can't even pay my light bills for me
I ain't enticed lil' homie, got ice bills... show me
Coz this nice deal holds me to this acting field nosy
I ain't the broad you want to beef wit'
Better use what you sleep wit'
That language that you speak wit'
Will make you lose your teeth quick
Crushed velvet and sequins
You broads are just the cheapest
Same chick Kim said you'd find down at FreakNic
Hush puppy muse, oh enough I'm amused
Same chickens in sessions around Jagged & Absolute
Studio groupies is what I call that
Say it, cause that's how y'all act
Same chickens on the bra-strap
Actin' like we go all back, yo

*Samples MC Lytes ""Shut The Eff Up (Hoe)""*

Say what?
You broads don't get it do you
Uh-huh, uh-huh I put it down like this
y'all don't know what it is
Is it cause big girls be tough beneath the see-cups
Pull up to your club, ten deep, three trucks
Rovers for the winner, with the seats heating up
Oh the tint too dark, what's wrong can't see enough
Cause hell when I show up, didn't expect me to blow up
Advance like Boa, now I want you to throw up
Cause I'm the type of broad that set a goal, reach a goal
Say three, cause it's reasonable
Then go Gold, just regional, so...

y'all really should just stop hatin'
We're gonna do it like this
Oh, this where you broads gonna piss me
What you got against me?
Mr. Man stand wit' me, get back you all quizzy
Call me charged as if I'm guilty, in a minute, I'ma simply
Snap my finger like a sissy, tell 'em all where to kiss me
In the club, same thing (now ain't that a coincidence)
Now I'm the one you spill your drink on (Clumsy with Chrissy Chrissy)
These broads are fake, I know, but they gon' face Cha though
I'm in a lace condod, ballin' down the Lake Tahoe
Fellas with broads is trife now, but it costs my lifestyle
Sitting steady for a while, just to figure your wives out
Put an end to these fits, makin' it with a long kiss
Make her jam meet these fists, she f'ed with the wrong chick
Astonished, you want this, I promise I won't miss
And I get Miss Who She Wit', ice grillin' accomplice
She modeling from the Explorer, think my man ex-whore
Had run-ins with her before, but this time here's what I told her
You know what?

*Samples MC Lytes ""Shut The Eff Up (Hoe)""*

I tell her like that uh-huh yeah
Tuskadero baby, what you thought
You know? See how you gonna hate the laced broad
Cause I'm in the club with you and we got the same thing on
But I'm 'bout it

You best remember, who kept ya warm during the winter
And kept the judges paid through the whole trial in September

Wreck my brain, my patience wearing in

Down to lie for the baby, in a ride like y'all
To many ladies is jealous of the Mercedes
And how close we are lately, that's why I don't like broads
Either you chickens like all in the business
Asking y'all who did it, them inquiring type broads
Intimidated cause I could be the misses
But I'm like a little sister and I'm tired of liking y'all
I only ride shot gun cause it's rightful
Make her hope in the back just to be fightful
Just because I know it's tight when my eyes closed
Just as soon as these niggas drop me off she gone be out though

And I find that these gold digging hoes, they out to get a nigga
Fuck up my foes and enemies, I'm bout to hit a nigga
Let a nigga mettle wit not cheddar, will I kill a nigga?
Just because he jealous of the fellas got him drinking liquor
Thinking that a nigga is slipping, but I ain't shorty
Damn what you keep money for?

Well I can't doubt it, might as well forget about it
Lot of folk talk I'm talking shit about him

When we pull the ball out to test, so bitch I been bout it

Cause I'm that broad that their broads tell more broads about
And on their mouths is the mouths my name won't stay out
Big benjamining in the slimming
And see me, I keeps in it
Chrome spinning window tinted
I can see me all up in it
It's only summer I have him moving out before fall
How the misses gon' let the mistress steal dough from y'all?
Have him taking me to the places he don't go with y'all
Be the one he sneak and call when he out with y'all
Come on y'all gotta admit it's kind of good to be young
Got his whip, got him whipped, and she don't know what's going on
Yeah I ran that bank account, spent everything in it
Took the credit cards, pushed the Visa to the limit
She be so nieve too the things you believe boo
If I was you I'd be rocking these sunglasses too, come on

Repeat 1

I see this industry gon' love me or hate me
But y'all aren't fans, ain't gonna make me or break me
It takes you a year to get a hit I can't relate see
Cause what you doing in minutes, seconds it takes me
Ain't got no choice so take your verbal spanking like a troop
We're all actors and I'm whooping your whole cast and crew
I make this vow if it's the last thing a sister do
To rip this mic until I'm out of breath or black or blue
This is going out to all your rappers who be acting new
Give me my props or I'mma take them like a rapist do
And why you females hatin' me cause I ain't hatin' you?
I'll take your man for a second but I'll give him back to you
Ain't trying to keep him every state have a him and you
If you were in these sneaker shoes you would do it too
So understand y'all just got picked out of the chosen few
But he gon' always gonna think of me when he holding you
What'cha want to do? Come on

I make 'em come up out the cuffs quick to touch this Miss Luscious
Make you see how much you miss from the broad you fuss with
Ask a friend if you don't know-oh, vanilla slash cocoa
I be dipping your five to the uh-oh
Messing with that Sebring chick, touch knee deep quick
And if need be switched cause the team is getting thick
I keeps all I leave with ain't nothing strategic
Broads see chick want to be chick
Without cause, sea sick

Moving that kind of weight, getting them kind of ends
Count me in, you really trying to ball and spin

Del viejo puente, del río y la alameda 
Déjame que te cuente, limeño 
Ahora que aún perfuma el recuerdo 
Ahora que aún mece en su sueño 
El viejo puente el río y la alameda 

Jazmines en el pelo y rosas en la cara 
Airosa caminaba la flor de la canela 
Derramaba lisura y a su paso dejaba 
Aroma de mixtura que en el pecho llevaba 

Del puente a la alameda 
Menundo pie la lleva 
Por la vereda que se estremece 
Al ritmo de su cadera 
Recogía la risa de la brisa del río 
Y al viento la lanzaba del puente a la alameda 

Déjame que te cuente, limeño ay! 
Deja que te diga moreno mi pensamiento 
A ver si así despiertas del sueño 
Del sueño que entretiene, moreno

Aspiras de la lisura 
Que da la flor de canela 
Adornada con jazmines 
Matizando tu hermosura 

Alfombras de nuevo el puente 
Y engalanas la alameda 
que el río acompasara tu paso por la vereda 

Y recuerda que, jazmines en el pelo y rosas en la cara 
Airosa caminaba la flor de la canela 
Derramaba lisura y a su paso dejaba

From the brim to the dregs
It poured sweet and clear
It was a very good year",It Was a Very Good Year
Chad & Jeremy,"When I was just a lad of ten, my father said to me
Come here and learn a lesson from the lovely lemon
Tree
Don't put your faith in love, my boy, my father said to
Me
I fear you'll find that love is like the lovely lemon
Tree

Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat

Beneath the lemon tree one day, my love and I did a lie
A girl so sweet that when she smiled the sun rose in
The sky
We passed that summer lost in love beneath the lemon
Tree
The music of her laughter hid my fathers words from me

Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat

One day she left without a word, she took away the sun
And in the dark she left behind, I knew what she had
Done
Shed left me for another, its a common tale but true
A sadder man but wiser now I sing these words to you

Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat",Lemon Tree
Chad & Jeremy,"I've a most unusual coloring book
 The kind you never see
 Crayons ready, very well
 Begin to color me
 These are the eyes that watched her as she walked away
 Color them grey
 This is the heart that thought she would always be true
 Color it blue
 These are the arms that held her and touched her then lost her somehow
 Color them empty now
 This is the tie I wore until he came between
 Color it green
 This is the room I sleep in and walk in and read in
 Hidin' that nobody sees
 Color it lonely please
 This is the girl, the one I depended upon
 Color her gone
 Color her gone
 Color her gone",My Colouring Book
Chad & Jeremy,"The leaves of brown came tumblin' down, remember
 In September in the rain
 The sun went out just like a dying ember
 That September in the rain
 To every word of love I heard you whisper
 The raindrops seemed to play a sweet refrain
 Though spring is here, to me it's still September
 That September in the rain

 To every word of love I heard you whisper
 The raindrops seemed to play a sweet refrain
 Though spring is here, to me it's still September
 That September in the rain
 That September in the rain",September in the Rain
