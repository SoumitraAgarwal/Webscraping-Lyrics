Martha Reeves,"I've been crying
'Cause I'm lonely (for you)
Smiles have all turned to tears
But tears won't wash away the fears
That you're never ever gonna return
To ease the fire that within me burns

It keeps me crying baby for you
Keeps me sighin' baby for you
So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me
(Come see about me)
See about your baby

I've given up my friends just for you
My friends are gone
And you have too
No peace shall I find
Until you come back
And be mine
No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you anyway

Keep on crying baby for you
I'm gonna keep sighin' baby for you
So come on hurry
Come on and see about me
(Come see about me)
See about you baby

Sometime's up
Sometime's down
My life's so uncertain
With you not around
From my arms you maybe out of reach
But my heart says you're here to keep

Keeps me crying baby for you
Keep on, keep on crying baby for you
So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me (Come see about me)
See about you baby (Come see about me)
You know I'm so lonely (Come see about me)
I love you only (Come see about me)
See about your baby (Come see about me)
Hurry, hurry",Come See About Me
Martha Reeves,"You're like quicksand, quicksand, pulling me closer closer in my arms.
Can't you see, it's your loving charms,
It's like quicksand sinking me deeper in love with you.
 
The more I find it, the deeper in love I get.
Each time you call me, I feel nothing but happiness.
It's not sane, loving you this way,
But from your heart I can't stay.
 
You're like quicksand, quicksand, pulling me closer closer 
making me love you, need you 
It's like sinking me deeper, deeper in love with you.
 
The more I find it, the deeper in love I get.
Each time you call me, I feel nothing but happiness.
It's not sane, loving you this way,
But from your heart I can't stay.
 
You're deeper, deeper, deeper in love with you.
My heart is a prisoner of your warm embrace,
I can't help it, I can't help myself.
Nothing can take your place.
Ah, when you say sweet things to me,
I start trembling from head to feet.
You're like quicksand, quicksand, 
Yea, pulling me closer, closer.
I just can't resist you, 
I just want to kiss you,
You're like quicksand, yea.

Martha Reeves,"Anyone who ever loved could look at me
And know that I love you
Anyone who ever dreamed could look at me
And know I dream of you
Knowing I love you so

Would take me in his arms and love me, too
You couldn't really have a heart and hurt me
Like you hurt me and be so untrue
What am I to do

This time it's goodbye, dear
Loving you the way I do

Martha Reeves,"This mornin' when I woke up, sushine touched my heart 
Children of the earth, they walk so far apart 
From this protection of what's supposed to be 
They don't have it goin' right
You've been people 

Who loves your neighbor  
They seem to miss the boat 
Letting others drown so they can stay afloat 
But we have love so real, just let them be 
I wanna thank someone for sendin' you to me 

Bless your mother, bless your father 
But most of all, bless you, bless me 
Let our love last for eternity 
People will try to break it 
They don't wanna see us make it 
We'll never let them take it, no sir-ee 

I can well remember, you left yourself home 
And the spells we left each other just last strong 
You think we'll have a love to share like we do 
They'd know the happiness I've got in here in you 

Bless you, bless me 
Let our love last for eternity 
People will try to break it 
They don't wanna see us make it 
We'll never let them take it, no sir-ee 

Oh I've got you and baby, you got me 
I wanna thank someone for lettin' us be 

Bless your mother (bless your mother) 
Bless your father (bless your father) 
But most of all, bless you, bless me 
Let our love last for eternity 
We're gonna make it, boy 
Heaven won't break it, boy 
I wanna share my joy that's heavenly",Bless You
Martha Reeves,"This time we almost made the pieces fit
Didn't we?
This time we almost made some sense of it
Didn't we?
This time I had the answer, right here in my hand
Then I touched it and it had turned to sand

This time we almost sang our song in tune
Didn't we, love?
This time we almost made it, made it to the moon 
Didn't we, love?
This time we almost made our poem rhyme
This time we almost made that long hard climb

Martha Reeves,"All the world over, so easy to see
People everywhere just wanna be free
Listen, please listen, that's the way it should be
Peace in the valley, people got to be free

You should see, what a lovely, lovely world this would be
If everyone learned to live together
It seems to me  such an easy, easy thing this would be
Why can't you and me learn to love one another

All the world over, so easy to see
People everywhere just wanna be free
I can't understand it, so simple to me
People everywhere just got to be free
Ah, ah, yeah . . . ah, ah, yeah

If there's a man  who is down and needs a helping hand
All it takes is you to understand and to see him through
Seems to me, we got to solve it individually
And I'll do unto you what you do to me

There'll be shoutin' from the mountains on out to sea
(out to the sea)
No two ways about it, people have to be free
(they got to be free)
Ask me my opinion, my opinion will be
(ah-ha)
It's a natural situation for a man to be free

Oh, what a feelin's just come over me
Enough to move a mountain, make a blind man see
Everybody's dancin', come on, let's go see
Peace in the valley, now they want to be free

Martha Reeves,"I walk along the city streets you used to walk along with me
And every step I take reminds me of just how we used to be
Well, how can I forget you, girl?
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me

As shadows fall, I pass a small cafe where we would dance at night
And I can't help recalling how it felt to kiss and hold you tight
Well, how can I forget you, girl?
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
I was born to love her, and I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me
Oh whoa ooh whoa ooh whoa oh

If you should find you miss the sweet and tender love we used to share
Just go back to the places where we used to go and I'll be there
Well, how can I forget you, girl?
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
I was born to love her, and I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me
'Cause there is always something there to remind me

Martha Reeves,"Now we kiss good-bye
you'll be off to war, the battle's on 
I don't wanna cry as I stand 
And watch your ship sail on 
Now when you're out to sea
And the sky is dark and water surrounds you 
And your heart just won't be 'cause you feel 
As if our loneliness will drive you

Forget me not, boy 
Let my love comfort you 
Comfort you and see you through 
Forget me not, boy 
Lock my memory in your heart 
And we'll never be apart

Remember Old Joe's, 
Our favorite song, our table for two
Well, heaven knows, these little things 
I'll share with no one but you 
Wherever you are, no land 
And sea and time will divide us 
No matter how far
Back to each other's arms our love's gonna guide us

Forget me not, boy 
Write a letter every day 
Don't throw my picture away 
Forget me not, boy 
Let my love within you burn 
I'll be here when you return

Each night I will pray for peace on earth, goodwill to all men 
And my little heart will say these tender words time and time again:

Forget me not, boy 
Let my love within you burn 
I'll be here when you return 
Forget me not, boy 
Lock my memory in your heart 
And we'll never be apart 
Forget me not, boy",Forget Me Not
Martha Reeves,"You're shiftless and you're lazy
Just like the hound dog, Daisy 
I had when grandma raised me
Honey chile, poor Granny 
Got too old to scorn me
Dear old auntie warned me 
You sure was no good for me
Honey chile, but your kiss 
Is sweeter than the cake
That grandma used to make
Oh them sweet little things about ya 
Sure enough takes the cake
You ain't gonna amount to nothing
'Cause you ain't gonna work for nothing
Without you, I'm good for nothing

Sure 'bout to drive me wild
And I love you so 
Can't let go 
Now honey chile oh sugar chile
I'd walk a country mile 
Just to be with you 
And to stay with you, now honey chile

I try to act like a lady 
But you've been courtin' Sadie
Your reputation's shady 
Honey chile, hey you even took out Sally
Who lives across the alley 
Oh I've been keeping tally 
Honey chile you're like the grapes
Upon the vine at winning pretty wine
'Cause like that home made wine so sweet
You sure enough drove me out of my mind now
You ain't nothing but a playboy 
Using me for a play toy 
You're ruining my pride and joy 
Now honey chile, honey chile
Sure 'bout to drive me wild
And I love you so, can't let go 
Now honey, ,oh sugar chile
I'd walk a country mile 
Just to be with you 
And to stay with you, now honey chile

One day I'm gonna get stronger
And I won't need you no longer
This feeling will be a goner

Martha Reeves,"Babe, I wanna tell you what's exactly on my mind 
I won't stay at home another night 
While you're out makin' time 
I'm well aware of where you go 
And every girl you see 
'Cause whenever I can't find you, 
Boy, my phone begins to ring 

I can't dance to that music you're playin' 
Stop, think it over, & rewrite your tune 
I can't dance to that music you're playin'

You said ""Where's Little Joe? 
We had a one-night stand 
To play down on Covent Road 
If you went down to the park to play 
You weren't playin' with your band 
'Cause your sax was here at home

If you really love me, then unpack your bags and stay 
Don't tell me you've got to think it over, got to get away 
I've taken all that medicine of yours that I can stand 
Now please change your prescription or find another band

Martha Reeves,"I promise to wait, my love, right here till you return 
With a love that's weak and a heart that sadly yearns 
Yearns because you've left me all alone and blue 
And to another I know I just can't be true 
I know that you'll come back home 
But hurry up, don't take so long 
'Cause I love you, need you 
Even though you've done me wrong 
I promise to wait, my love, until you finally find 
The love you're sharin' now is not as real as mine 
Her love is like a diamond only worth a dime 
But my love for you is strictly genuine 
I know that you'll come back home 
But hurry up, don't take so long 
'Cause I love you, need you 
Even though you've done me wrong 
How I miss you; I long to hear you call my name 
And since you've been gone, baby, 
You don't think this ain't been the same, no 
I promise to wait, my love, right here till you return 
With arms that want you, baby, & flames that forever burn 
I cry for your tender love & ever-lovin' kiss 
And your tight embrace is what I really miss 
I know that you'll come back home 
But hurry up, don't take so long 
'Cause I love you, need you 
Even though you've done me wrong 
Gonna stay right here, my love; ain't goin' away 
Gonna wait for you, baby",I Promise to Wait My Love [Bonus CD Track] [*]

Oh yeah (get out of here, 
Love bug leave my heart alone)
Leave my heart alone (get out of here,

Spring is here and like a wayward breeze
The love that left me came back haunting me
He's like the ever changin' sun

To stir my tender feelings through his words of honey 
But if you wait to sleep in love
I bear it deep inside

Again he'll leave me cryin'

Hope you fly away
Spread your little wings, leave my heart and fly away

How can I live through another day
Watching my dreams turn to ashes

Now I am numb, I've become unreal
I walk the night, without a goal
Stripped of my heart and my soul

What now my love, now that it's over?
I feel the world falling all around me
Here come the stars, tumbling around me
There's the sky, where that sea should be

What now my love, now that you're gone?

So kiss me and say you understand

Bei mir bist do schon means that you're grand

It means I am begging for your hand

Afraid to find another one caressing you
Although you promised me that this could never be

I climbed up the door and o-pened the stairs.
I said my pajamas and put on my pray'rs.
I turned off the bed and crawled into the light.
And all because you kissed me (Kiss) goodnight.

Next morning, I woke and scrambled my shoes.
I shined up an egg, then I toasted the news,
I buttered my tie and took another bite.
And all because you kissed me (Kiss) goodnight.

By evening I felt normal, so we went out again.
You said, ""Goodnight,"" and kissed me.
I hurried home and then,

I said my pajamas and put on my prayr's.
I turned off the bed and crawled into the light,
And all because you kissed me (Kiss) goodnight.

I powdered my hair and pinned up my nose.
I hung up the bath and I turned on my clothes.
I put out the clock and wound the cat up tight,
And all because you kissed me (Kiss) goodnight.

I ran up the shade and pulled down the stair.
I curled up the rug and I vacuumed my hair.
I just couldn't tell my left foot from my right,
And all because you kissed me (Kiss) goodnight.

By evening I felt normal, so we went out again.
You said, ""Goodnight,"" and kissed me.

Martha Wainwright,"I wrote this song late last night about my brother and all his might
And you would be so very kind to listen to these words I've written
About the boy who seems quite smitten, but like no other you will find
'Cause, baby, I know the reasons why we were unkind

He's Laurel, he's Hardy, he's the life of the party
And he's got great taste in furniture
Wakes up at noon, plays the piano till he swoons, goes out for food
'Cause, baby, I know the reasons why we were unkind
But I gotta know why

Three years before me, you came out and cried
Boy, not a girl, where'd you get all that pride?
You are so very thin and I've always wanted to fit into your pants
Photogenic at first glance, but got something missing for romance

We share a mother, we do and a daddy too
Home on [unverified] avenue and a melancholy mood
With a rhapsody in blue
'Cause, baby, I know the reasons why we were unkind

First born son, son of a gun
I love you even more than when the song was begun

Martha Wainwright,"Poetry is no place for a heart that's a whore
And I'm young and I'm strong
But I feel old and tired
Over fired

And I've been poked and stoked
It's all smoke, there's no more fire
Only desire
For you, whoever you are
For you, whoever you are

You say my time here has been some sort of joke
That I've been messing around
Some sort of incubating period
For when I really come around
But I'm cracking up
And you have no idea

No idea how it feels to be on your own
In your own home
With the fucking phone
And the mother of gloom
In your bedroom
Standing over your head
With her hand in your head
With her hand in your head

I will not pretend
I will not put on a smile
I will not say I'm all right for you
When all I wanted was to be good
To do everything in truth
To do everything in truth

Oh I wish, I wish, I wish, I was born a man
So I could learn how to stand up for myself
Like those guys with guitars
I've been watching in bars
Who've been stamping their feet, to a different beat
To a different beat
To a different beat

I will not pretend
I will not put on a smile
I will not say I'm all right for you
When all I wanted was to be good
To do everything in truth
To do everything in truth

You bloody mother fucking asshole
Oh you bloody mother fucking asshole
Oh you bloody mother fucking asshole
Oh you bloody mother fucking asshole
Oh you bloody mother fucking asshole
Oh you bloody

I will not put on a smile
I will not say I'm all right for you

For you, whoever you are
For you, whoever you are",Bloody Mother F***ing A**hole

These night's that I've been on the road
Through my window the moonlight she shone
And on my walls the fire she danced
Playing out my very last chance to run, run, run, run

On my TV, walking my streets, making sounds
And I can walk with them I love them I need their love
There are others I have known as poor souls, sores exposed
The the run-of-the-mill, the destitute, and the cold
Sores exposed to the blisters and shards
Where any kind of kindness is as far as the sun, the sun

In some lovely way I hear your call
Whatever happened to them all?
Whatever happened to us all?

I know that we've never met before
But that was then, and now I need you more
Is someone here keeping the score?
Is there only dying at your door? 
Taking me down off this cross
Lay me down, down, down in the dust
Whoa, love, take my hand across the crowd
I have been digging underground
What'er remains is yet to be found
I have no children
I have no husband
I have no reason
To be alive
Oh, give me one

Green grass blades are all on fire
I own the crack that's in the wind
From your window I see bars and the birds
They sing and they sing and they sing and they sing
And the dogs
They bark and they bark and they bark and they bark and they bark

Whatever happened to them all?
Whatever happened to us all?

And there are things these days
That can help you through a phase
Like food & health & fear
I prefer the beer
Not the way that I don't love you

From the ocean floor
It speaks its native tongue
Physical, subliminal
Not the way that it left you cold

When the Sun, it fills its girth
And I know we'll go howl at the night
But still the sun will not hide our fight

Martha Wainwright,"Home no more home to me, whither must I wander?
Hunger my driver, I go where I must
Cold blows the winter wind over hill and heather:
Thick drives the rain and my roof is in the dust

Loved of wise men was the shade of my roof-tree
The true word of welcome was spoken in the door -
Dear days of old with the faces in the firelight
Kind folks of old, you come again no more

Home was home then, my dear, full of kindly faces
Home was home then, my dear, happy for the child
Fire and the windows bright glittered on the moorland;
Song, tuneful song, built a palace in the wild

Now when day dawns on the brow of the moorland
Lone stands the house, and the chimney stone is cold
Lone lt it stand, now the friends are all departed
The kind hearts, the true hearts, that loved that place of old

Spring shall come, come again, calling up the moorfowl
Spring shall bring the sun and the rain, bring the bees and flowers;
Red shall the heather bloom over hill and valley
Soft flow the stream through the even-flowing hours

Fair the day shine as it shone on my childhood
Fair shine the day on the house with open door
Birds come and cry there and twitter in the chimney
But I go for ever and come again no more



",Whither Must I Wander
Martha Wainwright,"There are days, when the cage
Doesn't seem to open very wide at all
There are others that would shock, the most indiscriminate lovers of all
My heart was made for bleeding all over you

You got a girlfriend 
And I can only talk about her, for so very long
Then my mind turns into my heart
And whispers into that dark cave, that I've been wrong

[Chorus: ]
My heart was made for bleeding all over you
And I know you're married but I've got feelings too
And I still love you

You moved up North, you've got a farmhouse
There's cow shit in your brain and, love in your heart
I'm in the city and I'm trapped between two buildings 
And having to start at the start
You've got a daughter, now you're a father
You have your pack and they are wild

Since nineteen seventy nine
Not such a long time

Of this, I am allowed
'Cause you would never sue me baby

Have a drink after the show

But everything you say I oppose
I blame it on my hole

With booze and smoke from cigarettes and dope

And we, we made out on my tiny couch

More than you could love the common man

You never made it to the moon
We've all been waiting
Been waiting for you

Finally committed the crime
I decided that you were
Fundamentally unkind

And make, and you make, hold me down

About the king who went broke
It was the story of you
From the point of view of your death bed blues
And you will never believe in me again

You sign, you sign out in that questionable way

You always wrote a song a day
And there were always words
And it made me want to say ""shut up""

I'm in the Hearts Club Band
And I'm not, ever, ever coming back

I ride on the back of your life
But I never take your advice
You were cruel in a different way than I was used to
And you have the funniest smile I've ever seen
You look, you look better under water
Where my eyes can't see
The details in the face of who you pretend to be

You always wrote a song a day
And there was never room for yesterday's news
I'm on the back end of you

I wish I were
A singer
A dancer
Dancing for your love

Am I somewhere in the middle
Do I count at being special
Is there a sincerity in anything I say, ahh
Do I know what anything means
Can I see

I listen to the radio
Not music but the talk shows
I watch a lot of PBS and BBC
I don't want to meet the press
I'm scared, I'm scared of what I see

Is the pain in my side
And the hunger that I feel
Is the only thing that is real

Comes a knockin' at my door
There's a limousine outside

And I heard it bein' said
Aw, that the comfort in your head
And I wonder if it doesn't create a sense of shame

And you're leanin' on your wheel in your car
As you walk to the top of the hill
And you hope the will in your mind
Does not jump from the edge to the climb

It was the time before the last
And you did not give up
And I threw you on the ground
And you did not get up
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
But the tears in your eyes
It made me want to cry
But with a sense of shame

It was the time before the last
We did not make up
And I threw you on the ground
And you did not get up
And I don't know why
And I don't know why

On the wilder shores of love

Oh you'd go blind

To the other side of town
Where they don't count the days
With steel blades on the walls of time
They just dance naked in the sun all the time

She's the jewel in your crown
But I'm the gold that's gonna wear you down
I'll keep you around this dirty old town

Every time I put the stove on
Dinner's cold by the time you come over
Oh you turn over on that cold shoulder

To tempt you in and drive you far away

But you still can't get enough of the stuff

And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsession

And I want you

Love is a danger of a different kind
To take you away and leave you far behind
I said love is a danger of a different kind
To take you away and leave you far behind

It's savage and it's cruel
And it shines like destruction
Comes in like the flood
It seems like religion
It's noble and it's brutal
It distorts and deranges
And it wrenches you up
And you're left like a zombie

[Chorus: ]

It's guilt edged glamorous
And sleek by design
You know its jealous by nature
False and unkind
It's hard and restrained
And it's totally cool
It touches and it teases
As you stumble in the debris

Dotted in time
And the mangroves
They grow
Like our love

Stronger than the time spent
Down in the valley below

Take, take my hand
And push to the side
And come inside
And your hair it grows
Around your ears
Like a mysterious pose
That's music
To my fears, that will follow the years
Down to the valley below

Why did you come in the night
You hardly like me
You like people strong and free
That's not like me
I am caged in chains
Of my own sad nature
How do you change so fast
Like my face in the looking glass
I hardly recognize it",Niger River

As clear as day, as dark as night

And the truth became a lie

There was no longer peace of mind
Just fear of the unknown, and the unkind

And then when he undressed me
And took my body
I was resolute to be fine

Now the soldiers are all on fire
And our hearts, are dead from desire

And when you say it has nothing to do
Nothing to do with you, you're a liar

Why don't you go ask her for a second stack of lies

You cheated me and I can't believe it
I've been calling since 4 o'clock last night
You cheated me and I can't believe it
I saw you singing and dancing in the rain
On the way home

You left the keys in the door when you left that night
I don't wanna point the finger but I can't help it
Why don't you run your skinny little ass down the block?
I'll catch up to you when you come back
And you cheated me and I can't believe it
I've been calling since 4 o'clock last night
You cheated me and I can't believe it
I saw you singing and dancing in the rain

Martha Wainwright,"Get in the car we’re late for the gig
But don’t go too fast it’s been snowin’ since 10 am
We never will be this free again
Just over the bridge, crossin’ the Gatineau
To the side that I know where the light becomes strange
And we’ll never be this free again.

On our way home singin’ the songs that we learned on our mother’s knee
Four black sheep in need
Tryin’ or cryin’ to be free.

Jesse’s been drinkin’ again and again he won’t believe, he can’t believe
We can see right through his soul.
Mom and Dad are on their way, they know these roads
They’ve been travelling a lonely life.
Black sheep they too were born in the night.
And we’ll meet at the lodge to suck on life as we look up at the sky that we don’t feel the same.
And we’ll never be this free again.
May walked away in the snow sayin’ she was through.

And Frere Jacques would never want to ring the bell to tell us all
We already knew
That out there in the freezing night we will not be all right
Four black sheep travelin’ different speeds

Angry at the world
Losing their way in the cold blue snow.
Red on black on white it glowed.
We will never feel that free again.
We will never feel that free again.

After the show back on the road to Montreal
There were diamonds piercin’ our eyes
And the snow pilin’ up on either side.
Jesse took the wheel, there was an appeal to stop the ride
but we were just four black sheep in the night.

Tryin’ to hold on for our lives.
We never made it home, spinnin’ out on the road
We took to the sky where we were finally free for the last time.
Flyin’ high at the end of our lives.

Four black sheep deep in the white light
Red on black on white in the night

I said red on black on white in the night
Red on black on white in the night

But since, since you went away

With my head hanging down
And I wonder who's loving you

Oooh, my first mistake was
I wanted too much time
I had to have him morning, noon, and night
If I would of known then
The things that I know now
I might not have lost the time I complain about

Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded thoughts of dispair
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love
Ooh, ooh, baby hold on
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love

The art of playing games now
Is not the hearts you break
It's bound to good love you make
When it's heart's on fire
Give him love evryday
Remember he needs space
Be patient and he'll give his heart to you

Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded thoughts of dispair
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love
Ooh, ooh, baby hold on
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love

Trust and honesty too
Must be the golden rule
You'll feel the strength of passion in your soul
Burn so deeply within
Ooh, the magic that you share
So sacrifice and show how much you care

Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded thoughts of dispair
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love
Ooh, ooh, baby hold on
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love

Keep the ties
Hang on tight
And don't let go
No, no, no, no
If you need him
Just keep on
Just keep on hanging on
Little trust, honesty, golden rules
Feel the strength of passion in your soul
It's burning so deep
Have faith
Just keep the fire burning at home
Hey yea
He'll come home to you
He'll be there for you
He'll want to have you","Hold On, Pt. 1"
Martha Wash,"When there's a dark storm on your horizon
And you think you can't get through it
Just put your hand in my hand
And I'll show you how to do it

When the future looks uncertain
You can count on me to be there
And when your heart and soul are hurtin'
Just look and you'll see me there

Just follow where I lead 
I'll give you what you need
A love that's always true
And someone who believes in you

It's time to come alive
Your moment has arrived
I'll bring out the best in you
We can have it all
No, we will never fall
Looking down from our celestial view

So when you're searching for that rainbow
I will help you find it
And when a mountain stands before you
I will help you climb it

Just follow where I lead
I'll give you what you need
And I'll tell you something else
You'll start believing in yourself
It's an easy thing to do 
When you have someone who believes in you

Someone who believes
Someone who believes
I'm someone who believes
You've got someone who believes in you

Martha's Trouble,"God rest ye merry, gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ, our Saviour
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

In Bethlehem, in Israel,
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came;
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not then,"" said the Angel,
""Let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might.""
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His Mother Mary kneeling down,
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Beneath the blue

We both found what we were looking for.
With a friend to call my own,
I'll never be alone, and you, my friend, will see,

You feel you're not wanted anywhere.

There's something you should know, you've got a place to go.

I never knew how long you'd stay,
When you hear temptation call
It's your heart that takes,
Takes the fall

Won't you come out and play with me?

Step by step,
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart,
We never win,
But the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

It's getting hard to wake up in the morning,
My head is spinning constantly,
How can it be?
How could I be so blind to this addiction?
If I don't stop
The next one's gonna be me
Only emptiness remains,
It replaces all the pain.

Won't you come out and play with me?

Step by step,
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart,
We never win,
But the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

(We never win)

Only emptiness remains (ahh)
It replaces all the pain,

Won't you come out and play with me?

Step by step,
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart,
We never win,
But the battle wages on

I'm safe and warm
But I'm never alone
Because my heart is your home

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,

Martin Castillo,"Del rio frio donde inicia,
Por las calles andaba de prisa,
Aveces andaba descalzo y no tenia pa mas!

Barrio pobre y de esperanzas
Donde vivió aya en su infancia
Pero el mundo gira y tenia que cambiar

Tuve escuela de la calle
Mil consejos que me dio mi madre
También con el viejo aprendí a trabajar
Hoy la vida es diferente, firme camino hacia el frente
La suerte ha cambiado y el sol brilla mas

Con los dedos de la mano
Mis amigos los tengo contados
En buenas y malas no me han de fallar
El pepe y el juan al tiro, el rocke y el josesillo
Y el tío va conmigo es como mi carnal

Lo que vives lo que vales
Como se moviliza en el jale
Mide sus palabras nunca habla de mas
Quito algunos que estorban
Mi trabajo es a la sorda
No ocupo lucirme se bien despistar

Cosas buenas también malas
Son los golpes que te da el destino
No existe remedio ya no hay vuelta atrás
Un dolor fuerte en mi vida
Del señor la despedida,
Tengo fe que algún día lo vuelvo a mirar

Mis princesas son mis ojos
Lo que quiero y cumplo mis antojos
Y es a mi modo y no se diga mas
Firme estoy con mis hijitos, el andru y el angelito,
Por ellos no hay duda siempre eh de brincar

Mi delirio son las damas
Y con un vaso de un buen Buchannans
Seguido en el rancho me gusta pistear
Serio cuando se requiere
Pero al mil con mis deberes
Al que es de respeto lo eh de respetar

Cobro y vamos pa delante,
Pues la vida se va en un instante
Y la bella señora no avisa al llegar
Ya aprendí a vivir de todo
Rico, pobre ya ni modo

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Of paradise, where roses grew

Martin Gore,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air
For the little dark star on the wind down there
And he stated and promised he'd take special care
So it wouldn't get lost again

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over them
Keeping track of how it all goes on

But I've been walking all the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
And we're lost out here in the stars.

He lurks out in the darkness or in the neon's glow

My writhing shadow twists and turns as though it is in pain
I'm trying to escape the memory my heart recalls
And I cast a lonesome shadow on these lonely, lonely walls

"Martin Luther King, Jr.","Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.
But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.
In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the ""unalienable Rights"" of ""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked ""insufficient funds.""
But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.
We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.
It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.
But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.
The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. 
We cannot walk alone.
And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.
We cannot turn back.
There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, ""When will you be satisfied?"" We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until ""justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.""¹
I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where your quest -- quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. 
Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.
And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.""
I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.
I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. 
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of ""interposition"" and ""nullification"" -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; ""and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.""²
This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with.
With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.
And this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning:
My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. 
Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim's pride, 
From every mountainside, let freedom ring! 
And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.
And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.
Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.
Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania. 
Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.
Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.
But not only that:
Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.
Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.
Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.
From every mountainside, let freedom ring.
And when this happens, when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:
Free at last! free at last!
Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!",I Have a Dream

Back when in love was what to be
To know what truth was there to see
Was harder than keeping you close to me

Today I know that friends can be
More than good friends like you and me
The worst of what this story tells
Is me in love like no one else with you

*Made me believe in you 
Blindfolded by you 
Scolded by thoughts of you

Please don't throw my love away
What if you need this love someday
Please don't push it might go away
What if you come back nevertheless no
Please don't throw my love away
Don't you go taking for granted after all I gave
Don't throw this love away
Can't you see there's nothing else nobody else

But you and me not long ago
Were more than friends
We were lovers in a roll
Please tell me tonight
That night you were in love
As you were making me more and more
In love with you

With teardrops in my eyes 
And here I am alone starting to realize 
That my days would be brighter 
If I could learn to hide

Keeps haunting me inside 

Then my days begin 
With simple thoughts of you 
Hoping that tomorrow will be me and you 
Sharing dreams with each other 
And making them come true 
Holding one another, saying all I need is you 

But will you say that you love me 
And show me that you care 
Say when I need you 
You will always be there 
But if you go and leave me 
(Ooh) This I swear is true 
My love will always be with you 

Now my nights would end 
With just one wish, that's you 
To hold me in the dark 
And help me make it through 
'Cause the pain that's inside me 
Would simply melt away 
If I had you here with me 
And promise me you'd stay 

But will you say that you love me 
And show me that you care

Every memory repeats
Every step I take retreats
Every journey always brings me back to you

After all the stops and starts
We keep coming back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
After all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be
Forever you and me, after all

When love is truly right
(This time is right)
It lives from year to year
It changes as it goes
And on the way it grows
But it never disappears

After all the stops and starts
We keep coming back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
After all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be
Forever you and me, after all

Always just beyond my touch
You know I needed you so much
After all, what else is livin' for?

After all the stops and starts
We keep coming back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
After all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be
Forever you and me, after all

Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
After all that we've been through
Just comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be
Forever you and me",After All
Martin Nystrom,"You alone are my strength, my shield
To You alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship Thee

As the deer panteth for the water
So my soul longeth after Thee
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship Thee

You're my friend
And You are my brother
Even though You are a King
I love You more than any other
So much more than anything

I want You more than gold or silver
Only You can satisfy
You alone are the real joy giver
And the apple of my eye

Martin O'Donnell,"Remember those walls I built
Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound

I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now


It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can see your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can see your halo halo
Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want

And I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget

To pull me back to the ground again
Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'

I'm never gonna shut you out

Martin Page,"We've played the final game, now we both remain
Froze beneath your jealous sky
Lord knows I fear to tread, I see no steps ahead
Suspicion burns out all the lights

On a broken stairway
Is this where our love will stay?
On a broken stairway
We say goodbye

Silence corrodes the air, I guess we can't repair
The cracks that run right through our lives
All of the tears you fake are abandoned here halfway
Between the truth between the lies

On a broken stairway
Foundations rock and sway
On a broken stairway
We say goodbye

On a broken stairway
Is this where our love will stay
On a broken stairway

Martin Page,"Hannah is dreaming, she's young once again
She stands with her brother, with thousands of men
Her head has been shaven by a black uniform
She's one of God's children that waits at the door

Tears on her pillow, she tightens her lips
Touches the number tattooed on her wrist
The sign says, 'Treblinka', again she can't breathe
For all of the children she'll always see

They're her constant companions, six hundred souls
In the doors of the chambers, there's one door of hope
That would open to the forest and fields covered green
Where all of God's children again would be free

And they came out of the tunnels, went over in waves
She'd run with the others over the graves
As the watchtowers tumble in an ocean of fire
Some of God's children escaped through the wire

Slowly 'round the raven flies, scours the trees
Where they hide, the beast, he threatens, ""You won't survive""
She raises her fist and whispers in her sleep
""I am going to live, I am going to live""

Sunlight has risen in her garden today
Hannah is watching, her grandchildren play
She hears the bells ringing in a town far away
For all of God's children who died for this day
",The Door
Martin Page,"I see my mother sit in silence
Count the minutes to closing time
One more drink and he'll bring home anger
Like clockwork, I would hide

Heavy steps, drunken threats
Locked away I can feel you

In my room, I can hear her fight his kiss
In my room, I hear him bring down his fist
And still at night, I hear my mother cry, mother cry

Tonight the wait is over
And he won't be pacified
He'll raise his bottle just like a hammer
And she will be crucified

Broken cross, something lost
Locked away I can feel you

In my room, I can hear her fight his kiss
In my room, I hear him bring down his fist
And still at night, I hear my mother cry

What did she do to suffer you?
Her tears bleed through the walls in here
And I'll stand in your way, father
You won't hit her ever again, no

Broken cross, something lost
Locked away I can feel you

In my room, I can hear her fight his kiss
In my room, I hear him bring down his fist
And still at night, I hear my mother cry

And she lays herself down
No more strength to resist
Then I close my eyes
But the darkness won't forgive

And still at night, I hear my mother cry
Oh, don't cry, please don't cry
Just this time

And still at night, I hear my mother cry

Under the bridge where we met first time
I'm comin' across town
Walkin' to your house

Yesterday weighs you down
Oh, lonely girl, won't you come on out?
I swear, it'll be alright
On this holy night

Put on your red dress, baby
And wear your smile
Say goodnight to your sister
We're gonna walk for miles
We'll go where the boats are leavin'
In St.George's bay

And when I look into your eyes
There's one thing that I can say
No one loves you this way
So put on your red dress baby
And one more time let me see you smile
See you smile tonight

There's the abandoned train
Where we sheltered from the rain
Somehow I knew someday
We'd come here again

Put on your red dress, baby
And wear your smile
Say goodnight to your sister
We're gonna walk for miles
We'll go where the boats are leavin'

And when I look into your eyes
There's one thing that I can say
No one loves you this way
So put on your red dress baby
And one more time let me see you smile

See the candles burnin' on the Saturday night over rainy town
All over rainy town, see them smile tonight

Here on this empty road
We stare at ourselves in a shop window
Funny we seem so right
On this holy night

So put on your red dress, baby
And wear your smile
Close the door right behind you
Gonna walk for miles
We'll go where the boats are leaving
In St.George's bay

And recall the tenderness
As we sit by the waterside
Oh, I can never forget
That I was the man who let you
Slip out of his life
So put on your red dress, baby
And let me one more time
Make you smile tonight

See the candles burnin' on the Saturday night
Oh, see the candles burnin' on the Saturday night

Put on your red dress, come out and wear your smile
Put on your red dress
Put on your red dress, come out and wear your smile
Put on your red dress, come out and wear your smile

Love seems so far away
There's no sign of life in Eden's garden

On a Belfast street
Concrete stained
Blood and rain

for faith that's blind
The voice of reason cries
Oh why can't we shape the invisible

Brotherhood won't show his face
In the neighborhood
Drive by shots
time stops
Doors are locked

Behind my door
Fear is keeping score
Oh why can't we shape the invisible
And the dealer won't rest
'Til he sells a child death
Oh why can't we shape the invisible

Just another day,
Walking in the steps of Cain
In the desert sun
Lightning strikes
Chemical lights
Burn my eyes

Is now a soldier marching on 
He's been told to shape the invisible
Under poisoned skies
The children wonder why
Our fathers can't shape the invisible

Somewhere a small boy is playing with his toys
Someday his innocence
Will shape the invisible",Shape the Invisible

In a garage by the motorway

To a pawn on a Christmas day

Said God is dead and war's begun
Alvin Tostig has a son today

And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man

His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day 
Sits on the porch swing watching them fly
And Jesus, he wants to go to Venus

Complete for us to
Share together

You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who

Martin Sexton,"I was a fool I was so much younger then
The night she took me by surprise
I should have known all the trouble that I'd be in
But then she hooked me with those eyes

Her drink was gin as she said “Tonight would never end”
But her love weighed so heavy on my mind
For she was the live-in lover of a drummer I called my friend
She weren't nothing but a gypsy in disguise

Gypsy woman, how'd you do that to me?
Gypsy woman, stole my heart and then you set me free
Gypsy woman, how'd you learn to like that?
Gypsy woman, come on back

Spending my wages on rose and wine
We'd ride the days and we'd dance the nights
The things we could do in my old VW
The city lights never seemed so bright from the reservoir

And my friends they would warn me
Saying she's one fickle queen
Better get out while the getting is good my friend
And besides her old drummer man is looking

And he's so big and bad and mean
But what I didn't know then is what I know too well
She played me like a violin

Gypsy woman, how'd you do that to me?
Gypsy woman, stole my heart and then you set me free
Gypsy woman, how'd you learn to like that?
Gypsy woman, come on back

So you tell me that you're leaving me now
After all the times that we have been through
As your clown how am I gonna ever go home
Somebody tell me what am I gonna do

And so it goes I lost my pride and I lost my job
This gypsy woman took nearly every thing I called my own
It was a big surprise

So next time she comes dancing prancing through the town
Gonna recognize the gypsy, I'm gonna recognize the gypsy
Gonna recognize the gypsy in disguise

Silence, silence now

As you sit and read the paper
Dozing off, you dim the light
Put your glasses on the table
Sink into your easy chair

Dream the dream you've always dreamed of
You're a boy so free and wild
In this dream you capture freedom
And you're not your father's child

People cheer and clap their hands
Now you dream that you're a man
Amidst applause and blissful noise
You cannot hear your father's voice saying

Silence, silence now
Silence, silence now

As you dream you're in the circus
Ran away from home at ten
Got yourself a painted pony
Summersaults upon his back

This is what you've always wanted
Could this be the promise land
Share a laugh with all the carnies
Limelight and adoring fans

People cheer and clap their hands
Now you dream that you're a man
Amidst applause and blissful noise
You'll never hear your father's voice screaming

Silence, silence now
Silence, silence now

As you sit and read your paper
Dozing off you dim the light
As you wake your dream is over
Forget it all and say goodnight
Goodnight

Hangs a dark cloud over the moon

Was it your quality or high quantity that's put me in the shape I'm in

Martin Sexton,"In a rusted red Chevy with a heart full of glory
She left that night
A suitcase at the door open wide let the cold air come in
And then she asked me for a light

Said she had some old business see an old friend
Or maybe make a new start
But the words of her reason they changed with the season
And the truth burned in my heart

It blew me away and I thought I'd go crazy
Cause I knew even then I was caught

I'm caught in the rain again
I pray to the Heavens to defend me
I'm caught in the rain
Why's it seem like more rain that they send me?

So I listen to the wind for the answer
Time hangs heavy on my face
I run from the storm that's on it's way
Until I find there is no place

No person, no thing I can run to, no shelter I can gain from the rain
Yes I know this time it's too late, now

Cause I'm caught in the rain again
And I pray to the Heavens to defend me
I'm caught in the rain
Why's it seem like more rain that they send me? And they send me

And the rain comes down so silently
And time stand's still like it's in front of me
And the years turn to the rain
And this silence kills me

So now in this one horse town bar
I sing in the back room in the December night
Here she comes through the doorway
With a blustering wind that's too cold to forget

She looks like she knew me
The heat shot through me, melted me down
So we sat and talked about the old days
Or any new things that we found

Talked about the days when we were so much younger and innocent
We saw it plain, we were just caught in the rain

We're caught in the rain again
I pray to the Heavens to defend me
Caught in the rain
Why's it seem like more rain that they send me?

I'm out here on my knees
And my love knows I've been trying
Still I'm caught in the rain on these old fool ideas I'm relying
So I guess she gets me the rain again",Caught in the Rain
Martin Sexton,"I was a fool I was so much younger then
The night she took me by surprise
I should have known all the trouble that I'd be in
But then she hooked me with those eyes
Her drink was gin as she said tonight would never end
But her love weighed so heavy on my mind
For she was the live-in lover of a drummer I called my friend
She weren't nothing but a gypsy in disguise

Gypsy woman how'd you do that to me
Gypsy woman stole my heart and then you set me free
Gypsy woman how'd you learn to like that
Gypsy woman come on back

Spending my wages on rose and wine
We'd ride the days and we'd dance the nights
The things we could do in my old VW
The city lights never seemed so bright from the reservoir
And my friends they would warn me saying she's one fickle queen
Better get out while the getting is good my friend
And besides her old drummer man is looking
And he's so big and bad and mean
But what I didn't know then is what I know too well
She played me like a violin

So you tell me that you're leaving me now
After all the times that we have been through
As your clown how am I gonna ever go home
Somebody tell me what am I gonna do

And so it goes I lost my pride
And I lost my job
This gypsy woman took nearly every thing I called my own
It was a big surprise
So next time she comes dancing prancing through the town
Gonna recognize the gypsy
I'm gonna recognize the gypsy
Gonna recognize the gypsy in disguise",Gypsy Woman
Martin Sexton,"Every single time I come to this town
It brings out the worst in me
Decadence dries deep in the root of mine eyes
To bring out a thirst in me

Bust in to Burbank and buy a big beef jerky on Barham
Stare into the stockyard
Life in this car out on the road can be so easy

Then in the evenin' time, there's a welcome sight
In my lazy dreams
I'm still hopin', still hopin', still hopin' to find

The best in me is the beast in me
The best in me is the beast in me
The best in me is the beast in me
The best in me is the beast in me

Hansel and Gretel turnin' tricks for the big bad wolf on Sunset
In front of the health food store
See 'em linin' up in their Range Rovers and their Mercedes
For some peek a boo with the queen of hearts

And as the sun goes down in that purple sky
What passes for stars comes out
I'm still hopin', still hopin', still hopin' to find

The beast in me is the best in me
The beast in me is the best in me
The beast in me is the best in me
The beast in me is the best in me

The beast in me is the best in me
The beast in me is the best in me
The beast in me is the best in me
The beast in me is the best in me

I dreamed I saw Jesus on the sidewalk
Of Sodom burnin' sage he told me
""LA you're my desert rose, forgive me your age
I've done with my twenties but there's a reason to live
Swear I found it in the picks and pans of People magazine""

The best in me is the beast in me
The best in me is the beast in me
The best in me is the beast in me
The best in me is the beast in me

The best in me is the beast in me
The best in me is the beast in me
The best in me is the beast in me
The best in me is the beast in me

I made good my escape in my Geo Prism
The little red rental that could
I was prayin' no more hair would grow on my palms
As I drove away from the sign, it said
""Welcome to Hollywood""

Oh, it's the beast in me comin' on through
It's the best in me shinin' on through
Mama had told me, watch out for the beast in me
But mama, mama it's okay
Yeah, the beast in me, oh, it's the best in me
Oh, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

The beast in me is the best in me
The beast in me is the best in me
The beast in me is the best in me

Martin Sexton,"Hey little jail bait 
Tell me a story 
Let me bum a smoke and we can chat a while 
I only need a moment 

One moment in your glory 
Before you get off and make your change 
Talking 'bout a woman that hasn't felt a day in a while 
Talking 'bout a woman that just can't say no 

She needs another lover like she needs another dose in her blood 
Talking 'bout a woman whose name is 
Candy 
She's so fine 

She's waiting on the backstreet line 
Like a 
Lost angel 
Not long for this world 

Don't usually get emotional 
Don't usually show my vein she said 
Only when I sing or when I'm making tracks 
And sweatin's just my mean way 

To show me where I am 
And to tell me where I need to be 
And through those eyes 
If she wore her disguise 

I'd see through it and say 
Come in from the rain girl 
Talking 'bout a woman she loves me like a dog loves a bone 
Talking 'bout a woman I just can't let go 

I need her as my lover like I need another hole in my head 
I'm talking 'bout a woman I know 
Candy 
She's so fine 

But she's shaking on that backstreet line 
Like a loose cannon 
Ashamed to explode 
In the middle of my day 

In the night 
When will I learn 
To let you go 
You're my Candy 

You're my 
Lost angel 
Not long for this world",Candy
Martin Sexton,"Hold me tight don't say goodnight
And I'll let you know that I care
Wait a little longer don't let me be
And I'll comfort you from the storm
It's been a long night tomorrow's another day
Call me when you find out the answer 
And I'll hope and I'll pray 
To a power that will keep me from goin' insane in the meantime

Teenage lovers caught up in this dance
Pain's the price of this young romance
How was I such a young fool to know
Lord knows I got no direction from home
So I say this prayer

Take hold of me blessed powers that be
Love keep us together

Down with the rain came the news
That our wild ways gonna bring us a baby boy
Wash away all those innocent dreams
Now my whole world is turned upside-down on me
And here I pray
To some power they say's gonna keep me from goin' insane

I can't be strong unless I'm by your side
My weakness tells me to run for the hills
Responsibility beckons me
To think I dreamed your kiss would set me free
Well I've never been so wrong

Chorus

There cries a child so deep in the night
He needs a father somebody to set things right
I am the one to love to hold him tight
To discount by love a serious oversight
Higher power has brought us together I know
She will keep us together wherever we go
Even if I live a thousand miles away
My love is pure and strong and here to stay",Love Keep Us Together
Martin Sexton,"Oh my Maria 
Seems you got me in your spell once more 
Must be there's a storm on the way 
You taught me to know when you're near 
In your glance 
Recall my shady days of youth 
Stealing altar wine and microphones 
Not so blindly fueling my need 
As rock and roll fueled my dreams 
You know rock and roll fueled my dreams 
Back then you saw me as this child 
In great need of the wildest sin 
How sweet your grace I stumbled in 
And how completely you waved 
As I laughed in your face 
Oh my Maria 
Oh my Maria 
How you stood for strength and sanity 
Now is there someone poking holes in thee 
I see now why you called me near 
Maria my song can you hear 
I know you see the silence on the sidewalk 
And the anger in the street 
And the voices of all these children 
Coming up to my feet 
And we sing your song in vain 
As some preacher sees his reign 
Come down 
Maria 
Oh my sweet, Maria 
In the silence on the hill 
You know I'll be dreaming of you still 
Maria, oh my Maria 
I sing for my Maria 
I sing for my Maria",My Maria
Martin Sexton,"The other night I had a crazy dream
'Bout a man in a fishing hat selling magazines
All the way from Kingston he'd worked his way down
I bought him a drink on the night they kicked him out of town

He said, ""You know I don't like the way I am.""
""No, I don't like the way I am.""

And I saw an old fisherman out swayin' on a dock
Swigging a jug of something and a string of fish that he had caught
His wife had left him just a week before
She packed up her bags and waltzed on out the door

She said, ""You know I don't like the way I am.""
""No, I don't like the way I am.""

And then she cried
And you and me walked down the shores of our youth
Chasing the sunrise, challenging the truth

It's all so distant now I've seen too many lies
Turning my vision into crumbling demise

Makes me want to say
You know I don't like the way I am
No, I don't like the way I am

But I'm gonna change the way I am
I'm gonna change the way I am",Way I Am
Martin Sexton,"Does Satan wear a suit and tie 
Or does he work at the Dairy Queen 
Does he listen to rock and roll 
Does he feed the mean 
Singing Hallelujah 

What about Jesus 
Didn't he do it too? 
Hang out with prostitutes 
And have a drink or two. 
Power of example 
My mama said it and I heard 
She says one ounce of action 
Beats a ton of words.

Singing Hallelujah. 
Mama said there would be angels 
Mama said there would be sun 

Is the devil in Elvis to go where no white man went 
Or hiding in Hugh Hefner's body or maybe even Larry Flynt. 
Say, how's about the President shielding all them stones 
Man if I could find a shield like that I'd run 'round naked 
In my glass home.

Sippin' Hallelujah 
I think my angel's gone to Vegas 
Sippin' Hallelujah 
Holding aces in her hand. Hallelujah 
As she's singing rock of ages. Hallelujah 
On the table at the Sands. Hallelujah

Does Satan wear a suit and tie or 
Does he work at the Dairy Queen. 
Does he listen to rock and roll 
Does he feed the mean

All us saints here on earth 
Hypnotized and over-advertised 
'Til we're numb at birth

And my angel's turning pages 
Singing Hallelujah 
And she just don't understand. Hallelujah 
That the devil's hot on her trail. Hallelujah 
On the road to broken promised land. Hallelujah 
On the TV and the radio. Hallelujah

Are you ready to fill my soul

All those years I try not to remember
Singin Stevie tunes in the schoolyard
The nuns would whip their sticks and
Try to make me remember

When I sang those songs the penguins said
Keep down the noise
And you're never gonna make it as a choir boy

What in the world is happening to me
I think I'm happy
Like the first day of summer vacation
Happy when I get some rest and relaxation
Happy like the choir on Sunday morning

Sister, when you cook that way
Sweet distraction rules the day
The kitchen table honey just might break
To the sound of you and I rockin' our bodies

A hundred years ago
The fellas are gonna have to understand
And tip their hats to the man who scored

Like lovin' you all night long
Happy and sleeping on our front lawn
Happy like hearing my favorite song on the radio
Take me to the bridge
'Cause I've been 'round this world a hundred times
And I never knew love could happen this way

Thinking of me too

Or some other seaport town
I'd put my foot on a steamboat

Don't you remember, Molly
You gave me your right hand?
You said whenever you'd marry
I would be the man.

But you broke your promise
Go with whom you please

Molly came ridin' by
I could tell her mind was changin'
By the rovin' of her eye.

fingers long and small
told me she's good natured and that's the best of all

Martin Simpson,"Through streams and bogs and under bush, I made my weary way,
Though windfalls thick and devil's floods, my aching feet did stray.
Until at last by evening start, on higher ground I gained,
And there I met with a Creole girl, by the Lakes of Pontchartrain. 

Good evening to you Creole girl, my money is no good,
Although I fear the gators, well I must defend the wood.
You are welcome here kind stranger, my house is very plain,
But we never turn a stranger out, by the Lakes of Pontchartrain.

She took me to her mammy's house, and she treated me right well,
The hair around her shoulders, in them jet black ringlets fell.
I'd try to describe her beauty, but I find the words in vain,
So beautiful that Creole girl, by the Lakes of Pontchartrain.

Well I asked if she'd marry me, she said that could not be,
Because she loved a sailor, and he's far away at sea.
She said that she would marry him, and true she would remain,
Even through he never did comeback, to the Lakes of Pontchartrain.

So farewell farwell you Creole girl, I'll ne'er see you no more,
I'll ne'er forget your kindness, in the cottage by the shore.
And at each social gathering, a flowing glass I'd drain,
And I drink a health to the Creole girl, by the Lakes of Pontchartrain",Lakes of Ponchartrain

Wringing her fingers and tearing her hair

You were never any good with money.
You couldn't even hold a job.

When your grammar school days were over, 
It was nineteen-seventeen, 
And you did the right and proper thing.
You were just eighteen.
You were never mentioned in dispatches.
You never mentioned what you did or saw.
You were just another keen young man
In the mud and stink of war.

You were never any good with money.

Not steady enough for the office, 
Not hard enough for the hod.
You'd rather be singing the Pirate King, 
Or going fishing with your split cane rod.
You were never any good with money.
You couldn't even hold a job.

You came home from the Great War
With the pips of a captain's rank.
A German officer's Luger, 
And no money in the bank.
Your family sent you down in the coal mine
To learn to be captain there, 
But you didn't stand it very long.
You needed the light and the air.

You knew what should be done.
You would re-enlist to teach young men
The booby trap and the gun; 
And they sent you home to Yorkshire, 
With a crew and a Lewis gun, 
So you could save your seaside town
From the bombers of the Hun.

You would have seen that it never could work, 
And I would have never been born.

There's no proper work in your seaside town, 
So you come here looking for a job.
You were storeman at the power station
Just before I came along.
Nobody talked about how you quit, 
But I know that's what you did.
My mother said you were a selfish man, 
And I was your selfish kid.

You were never any good with money.
You couldn't even hold a job, 
Not steady enough for the office, 
Not hard enough for the hod; 
And your Norton it was soon gone
Along with your split cane rod.
You were never any good with money.
You couldn't even hold a job.

You showed me eyebright in the hedgerow, 
Speedwell and travellers joy.
You showed me how to use my eyes
When I was just a boy; 
And you taught me how to love a song
And all you knew of nature's ways:
The greatest gifts I have ever known, 
And I use them every day.

You were never any good with money.
You couldn't even hold a job, 
Not steady enough for the office, maybe, 
Not hard enough for the hod.
You'd rather be riding your Norton
Or going fishing with your split cane rod.
You were never any good with money.
You couldn't even hold a job.",Never Any Good

Martin Taylor,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Martin Taylor,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere

For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad

Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine

She wouldn't read that heart shaped note
She found in the pocket of his coat
That time in the car she found an earring
You know that doesn't prove a thing

She's heard the talk all over town
But she don't want to believe he's runnin' around
Deep down in her heart she's willing to bet
Oh but she ain't seen nothin' yet

He's not the same man that she met
Oh but she ain't seen nothin' yet
She thinks it's as bad as it's gonna get
Oh but she ain't seen nothin' yet",She Ain't Seen Nothing Yet

Two strangers passing on the sidewalk
Barely brush each other's hand
He says ""I'm sorry""
She says ""Don't worry""
And that is how it all began

A few short days and night together
And it's like they were meant to be
Lying there with her he softly whispers
Just think what we were so recently

Strangers, strangers
The world greatest lovers
Last week we were strangers

Two strangers passing in the hallway
Barely touch each other's heart
Now they're pretending
Two shadows blending
But they're a million miles apart

Soon she'll be packing up her suitcase
They'll be dividing all the blame
They know how they started
Now empty hearted
They don't have a clue how they became

Strangers, strangers
The world greatest lovers
And now they are strangers
The world's greatest lovers
Have turned into strangers
Strangers, strangers",Strangers
Martina McBride,"I know she must've cut you deep
She's gone but you won't let her leave
I know your heart has not healed yet
But sometimes I think that you forget

That wasn't me
That wasn't me
I'm not the one
Who made love bring you to your knees
You can't love if you can't trust
Her memory's hurt you long enough
Let your heart see
That wasn't me

I can no longer pay the price
For damage done by her careless lies
We can't move on 'til you let go
I always thought by now you'd know

That wasn't me

Martina McBride,"[Chorus]
Where I used to have a heart 
Feel like a mile wide ditch 
I got a hole inside 
The doctor just can't stitch 
Gone without a trace 
You left a hollow place 
There's not a stone to mark 
Where I used to have a heart 
 
There were times when I would 
hold you 
And feel the pounding in 
by chest 
Now I'm just as empty 
As a canyon way out west 
That's how deep I love you 
Babe, I love you  still 
To the bottom of this space 
I'll never fill 
 
[Chorus]
 
I guess I'll learn to live with 
A different kind of pain 
I'm suffering from a sickness 
That I cannot give a name
Such a strange sensation 
I've never felt before 
Missing you has cut me to the core 
 
[Chorus]
 
Where I used to have a heart",Where I Used to Have a Heart
Martina McBride,"They drank their anniversary glass
A silent moment passed
Then they kissed
She knows there's something on his mind
He'll tell her in due time
What it is

He says ""I've never built
Your mansion on a hill
Or warmed you in the Spanish sun
I simply blink my eye
And think as years fly by
Of all the things we've never done""

She smiles and takes his hand in hers
And says ""It just occurred
To me now
The thought that brings you such regret
What hasn't happened yet
It makes me proud""

""You never walked away
When I needed you to stay
Or made me feel I'm not the one
There've been no broken vows
And the reason we're here now
Is all the things we've never done""

""We've never grown apart
You never broke my heart
With secrets that you've kept me from
We've never been untrue
And I'm still here with you
Through all the things we've never done""",All the Things We've Never Done
Martina McBride,"The sky's been grey every day since I lost you
But I know the sun is shinin' somewhere, beyond the blue
My eyes were red when you said that we were through
But now I can see better days for me, just beyond the blue

Beyond the blue, on the other side of lonely
And it's only a matter of time, until I'm
Lookin' back and feelin' like I'm over you
When these tears are gone and I'm beyond the blue

Beyond the blue, on the other side of lonely

On my feet and I meet somebody new
And I fall in love again beyond the blue

As sure as stars light the midnight sky
As sure as children wonder why
As sure as newborn babies cry
I was born to give my love to you
Born to give my love to you

Heaven must be holding on
To all the love I'm feeling now
Here we are this is a moment
I believe it's our turn somehow

My own private hell on wheels
But this time I'm gone for good
And I've never gone this far before
Beyond the slamming of the back screen door
But you never loved me like you should

And there ain't no telling what I'll find
But I might as well move down the line
There's no comfort here in your zip code
I'd rather break down on the highway
With no one to share my load 
And cry on the shoulder of the road

It makes me feel a little low
Steel guitar on the radio
And it's kinda scary the way these truckers fly
So this how leaving feels
Drinking coffee and making deals with the One above
To get me though the night

And there ain't no telling what I'll find
But I might as well move down the line

Goin' through the motions of my life

But when the sun goes down
And the moon is high
I can't control the flood of all these tears inside
And if they only knew
They'd be so surprised
I'm just a good pretender in a great disguise

Keep 'em guessin', keep 'em laughin'
Build that wall up high
As long as they don't see the other side
You've really done it
Done a number, a number on my soul
But I'll be damned if I'll ever let you know

There's no way to hide the truth from me, myself, and I
Yeah, I wear it well
Though it ain't my size

Like some fools I see
I won't wear my heart out on my sleeve

Not for a moment
I'm gonna be okay

Martina McBride,"With lipstick on his collar and a trace of cheap perfume
He undresses in the darkness and eases into bed
With her face turned to the other wall she pretends to be asleep
But it doesn't really matter 'cause there's nothing to be said

He calls from work to tell her he's sorry about last night
If he uses all the right words she'll forgive him once again
But the phone just keeps on ringin' and he knows something's wrong
He feels his heart start pounding, and his head begins to spin

Phones are ringin' all over town
North and south and east and west on Main Street up and down
He's got friends of his callin' friends of hers
But she's nowhere to be found
Phones are ringin' all over town

He calls the hospital, her sister's house and the place that does her hair
God, if somethin' ever happened he'd surely lose his mind
And he's thinkin' it's just like she's disappeared into thin air
As American flight 204 departed right on time

North and south and east and west on Main Street up and down
He's got friends of his callin' friends of hers

So tired of livin' solitaire

Someday I'll find a net below
Someday I'm gonna be

I want arms that know how to rock me
Safe in the arms of love
I want to fall and know that love has caught me

I roll my heart out like a welcome mat

Oh I know you can hear me
But I'm not sure you're listening
I hear what you're sayin'
But still there's something missin'.
Whether I go,whether I stay
Right now depends on
Whatever you say.

You say yes you need me
And no you wouldn't leave me
And that should be enough to make me stay.
And even though I want to
I don't hear I love you
In whatever you say.

Oh I know you can hear me

Martina McBride,"From the day we met
You made me forget
All my fears
You knew just what to say
And you kissed away
All my tears
I knew this time I had finally found 
Someone to build my life around
Be a lover and a friend
After all my heart had put me through
I knew that it was safe with you
What we had would never end...
Wrong Again.

Everybody swore
They'd seen this before
We'd be fine
And you'd come to see
That you still love me
In good time
And they said there's nothing you can do
It's something that he's going through
It happens to a lot of men
And I told myself that they were right
That you'd wake up and see the light
And I just had to wait till then
Wrong again...

And it seemed to me the pain would last
My chance for happiness had passed
Nothing waited 'round the bend
I was sure I'd never find someone
To heal the damage you had done
My poor heart would never mend
Wrong again
Wrong again",Wrong Again

And every morning when I make my coffee
I can't believe my life's turned out this way
All I could say was

Love's the only house big enough for all the pain in the world
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain

Hey baby how you been?
Yeah I got me a little girl now and she's 4 years old
And she's got her daddy's little grin
And you only want what you can't have
And baby you can't have me now

Yeah I'm a mother and he's a father and we're a family
And we've got each other

Love's the only house big enough for all the pain in the world
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain

You drive three miles from all this prosperity
Down across the river and you see a ghetto there
And we got children walking around with guns
And they got knives with drugs and pain to spare
And here I am in my clean, white shirt
With a little money in my pocket and a nice warm home
And we got teenagers walkin' around in a culture of darkness
Livin' together alone, and all I can say is

Love's the only house big enough for all the pain in the world
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain

And I can't explain it and I can't understand
But I'll come down and get my hands dirty and together we'll make a stand
Somewhere cross the parking lot some bands playin' out of tune
City streets are gonna burn if we don't do something soon
And senorita can't quit cryin', baby's due now any day
Don Juan left, got sick of tryin'
No one there to show him the way
She came down to the grocery store and
She said I, I wanna buy a little carton of milk but I don't have any money
I said hey I'll cover you honey cause the pain's gotta go somewhere
Yeah the pain's gotta go someplace

Sometimes I sit on my
Front porch swing
Just soaking up the day
I think to myself, I think to myself
This world is a beautiful place

I have been blessed
And I feel like I've found my way
I thank God for all I've been given
At the end of every day
I have been blessed
With so much more than I deserve
To be here with the ones
That love me
To love them so much it hurts
I have been blessed

Across a crowded room
I know you know what I'm thinking
By the way I look at you
And when we're lying in the quiet
And no words have to be said
I think to myself, I think to myself
This love is a beautiful gift

I have been blessed
And I feel like I've found my way
I thank God for all I've been given
At the end of every day
I have been blessed
With so much more than I deserve
To be here with the ones
That love me
To love them so much it hurts
I have been blessed

When I'm singing my kids to sleep
When I feel you holding me
I know

I have been blessed
And I feel like I've found my way
I thank God for all I've been given
At the end of every day
I have been blessed
With so much more than I deserve
To be here with the ones
That love me
To love them so much it hurts
I have been blessed",Blessed [#]
Martina McBride,"She walks to school with the lunch
She packed
Nobody knows what she's
Holdin' back
Wearin' the same dress
She wore yesterday
She hides the bruises with linen
And lace

(Oh oh)

The teacher wonders but she
Doesn't ask
It's hard to see the pain
Behind the mask
Bearing the burden
Of a secret storm
Sometimes she wishes she was
Never born

Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In her world that she can rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place where
She's loved
Concrete angel

Somebody cries in the middle
Of the night
The neighbors hear, but they turn
Out the lights
A fragile soul caught in the hands
Of fate
When morning comes
It'll be too late

Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In her world that she can rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place where
She's loved
Concrete angel

A statue stands in a shaded place
An angel girl with an upturned face
A name is written on a polished rock
A broken heart that the world forgot

Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In her world that she can rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place where
She's loved

Every street we take
Is paved with truth
If a mountain's in our way
That's a mountain we move
Baby there ain't nothin' we can't do
Since me and you
Built a city of love

Through shiftin' sands
With our own hands
We dug to solid ground

What love's about
Yeah there's no stoppin' us now

Yeah on our own stone by stone
We built a fortress strong where

I am a hero,
I am strong and wise,
And I know no fear,

She was sent to rescue me,
I see who I want to be,

In my daughter's eyes,
Everyone is equal,
Darkness turns to light,
And the world is at peace,
This miracle God gave to me,
Gives me strength when I am weak,
I find reason to believe,
In my daughter's eyes

And when she wraps her hand around my finger,
How it puts a smile in my heart,
Everything becomes a little clearer,
I realize what life is all about,
It's hanging on when your heart is had enough,
It's giving more when you feel like giving up,
I've seen the light,
It's in my daughter's eyes

In my daughter's eyes,
I can see the future,
A reflection of who I am and what will be,
And though she'll grow and someday leave,
Maybe raise a family,
When I'm gone I hope you'll see,
How happy she made me,
For I'll be there,

Never let down my guard
Closed the curtain on my heart
So the world could not see
All the demons in me
Told myself I was free

Then you showed me how wrong I could be

[Chorus:]
Now I'm standing on a mountain of rubble
That once was a wall
Took years to build around me
And you came along
And you tore it down
Like it was nothing at all
Now it's a little scary
Learning to fall

When you looked in my eyes
Past the fear and false pride
You saw goodness inside
I can't believe how I feel
I believe love is real
And I'm ready to heal

You show me how right I can be

I was holding on, now I'm letting go
I was holding on, now I'm letting go
I was holding on, now I'm letting go

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

I wanna be His child again
Tell Him what my name is
In case He's forgotten

Tell Him I'm the woman at the well, drawing water
And I'm sorry if I've been His reluctant daughter

To keep me in their prayers
Remind them how I need
To feel them everywhere

Tell 'em I'm ready to drink living water
I don't want my angels to think I'm His reluctant daughter

Jesus, tell my Father
I want to come to Heaven
Tell Him to shout my name out

Martina McBride,"She remembers when she first got her wings
And how she opened up that day
she learned to sing
Then the colors came, erased the
black and white
And her whole world changed
when she realized

She's a butterfly, pretty as the crimson sky
Nothing's ever gonna bring her down
And everywhere she goes
Everybody knows she's so glad to be alive
She's a butterfly

Like the purest light in a darkened world
So much hope inside such a lovely girl
You should see her fly, it's almost magical
It makes you want to cry, she's so beautiful

God bless the butterfly,
give her the strength to fly
Never let her wings touch the ground
God bless the butterfly,
give her strength to fly
Never let her wings touch the ground

Never let her wings touch the ground

Martina McBride,"I was walking down the street
In my blue jeans and my bare feet
I saw old Mrs. Mayo in her garden so high

She got her prize azaleas
And her big ole fat tomatoes
She invited me in to have a piece of her pie

And later on I thought I'd head on down
By the Caley River to the old rope swing
There was a bunch of kids laughin' and jumpin' in
I sat down on the grass and I just watched them play
And all my worries seemed to wash away

Oh it's a magical thing
When the sun is shining down on me
And this is such a beautiful place
Don't want to miss a minute of today it's
So magical

Tonight I'll go home and write myself a letter
Tell myself to live a little freer and love a little better
Gonna soak it in like there's no tomorrow
And drink up every second like a big ole glass of water

Oh it's a magical thing
When the sun is shining down on me
And this is such a beautiful place
Don't want to miss a minute of today it's
So magical

Oh I feel like I could fly
When I see the world through these eyes

Martina McBride,"When you found somebody new I thought I never would
Forget you for I thought then I never could
But time has taken all the pains away until now I'm down to hurtin' once a day
Once a day all day long and once a night from dusk till dawn
The only time I wish you weren't gone is once a day every day all day long

I'm so glad that I'm not like a girl I knew one time
She lost the one she loved then slowly lost her mind
She sat around and cried her life away oh lucky me I'm only cryin' once a day

Now you're puttin' on the style
And you've never once looked back

You're the gossip of the town

Where you tossed it to the ground.
Pick me up on your way down.

Pick me up on your way down,
When you're blue and all alone
When their glamor starts to bore you,
Come on back where you belong.
You may be their pride and joy,
But they'll find another toy
And they'll take away your crown,
Pick me up on your way down.

They have changed your attitude,
Made you haughty and so rude,
Your new friends can take the blame,
Underneath you're still the same.
When you learn these things are true
I'll be waiting here for you,
As you tumble to the ground
Pick me up on your way down.",Pick Me Up on Your Way Down

Who can give more than you can,
Though you've given me everything money can buy
But your money can't hold me tight like he does,

You made me cry now I cried a lot I lost your love baby thanks a lot

You said I deserve just what I got well if that's how you feel honey thanks a lot

I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
And then today I started loving you again

With only these few million tears I've cried
I guess I should have known the worst was yet to come

Martina McBride,"He sits all alone in his easy chair
Staring back on his lost yesterdays
Long before he encountered the bottle
And the demons that drove her away

In his hand he is holding her photograph
Her image all tear-stained and worn
Tonight he's embracing reality
And he curses the day he was born

[Chorus]
And the darkness still echoes her warning
You can't have two loves in your life
Now the things that will haunt him
Until the day that he dies
Is the smell of cheap whiskey
And the sound of goodbye

Since the hour that she left he's been sober
And each breath that he draws makes him think
About the light of his life gone forever
When he traded her love for a drink

I close my weary eyes 
And see your face
I hold my pillow tight
And dream of your embrace

Martina McBride,"In waters calm I sailed from shore
To see what I might see
And having never sailed before
I drifted aimlessly
A warm breeze rocked my boat until
In slumber I fell sound
But woke to find the light grown dim
And dark clouds gathering 'round

In haste I worked at turning back
But now the wind blew wrong
And when the night came cold and black
My strength was almost gone
But with one last small thread of hope
I bowed my head to pray
Then through the dark I saw a rope
And heard a calm voice say

Grab the rope
Hold it tight
In the distance
Shines a light
Neither fear
Nor feel alone
There is One
Who'll lead you home

I heard my heart beat loud and fast
But did as I was told
And with the rosey dawn at last
Dry land I did behold
I kissed the sandy banks and swore
My sailing days were through
But should I ever stray from shore
I know now what to do

Grab the rope
Hold it tight
In the distance
Shines a light
Neither fear
Nor feel alone
There is One
Who'll lead you home

Martina McBride,"There's a photo in an album he don't notice anymore
That's me, that's me
There's a stack of cards and letters buried deep inside a drawer
That's me, that's me
And the shirt that I once slept in hanging loose behind the door
Tossed aside so carelessly
That's me, Oh that's me

There's a picture in my wallet and one less faded in my mind
That's him, that's him
There's a name that always haunts me and it slips from time to time
That's him, that's him
There's a yearning that I feel in my heart and in my soul
An old flame that'll never dim
That's him,  I know that's him

And a man at the altar says ""I do"" to someone else

They were herding us in and out of there like we were cattle
Not exactly the fairy tale that I had planned
But mama said, 'aren't you supposed to get married, girl
Before you bring a baby in this world?'
And what could I say but 'yes, ma'am'?

And I called her from that chapel in Love Land
I said, 'I really love this man.'
Love Land

Seemed like a lifetime driving from Vegas to Oklahoma
If you're allowed a number of mistakes in life, maybe I've filled my quota
They called it a reception, saying we did the right thing
And they smiled their broken smiles
Said, 'who needs to walk down the aisle?'
And I showed off my wedding ring

And we walked away hand in hand to Love Land
Oh, how I love this man
Love Land

Amazing all the progress we've made since the days of Thomas Edison
Still only God gives life in spite of modern medicine
Doctor's voices whispered, 'we did all that we could do
But your baby wasn't strong enough
To make it the whole nine months.'
And as my world broke in two
He said, 'I'll carry you through to Love Land.'

For the longest time I blamed myself
Thought I was paying for my mistakes
But we tried again
Now we're watchin' him blow three candles out
He's daddy's little man
And only God could have planned
The steps I've taken
That led me to where I am

I don't know how long this pain will last
All I know is it can't go on forever
Isn't this just pointless anyway
If you're tryin' to find a reason to stay

It's hard to admit it, what we know inside
We've tried everything, everything but goodbye
Say goodbye

If your heart has nothin' left to give
If your world feels like it's just stopped turnin'
Maybe that says all there is to say
If you're tryin' to find a reason to stay

It's hard to admit it, what we know inside
We've tried everything, everything but goodbye

Maybe it's just time to walk away
If you're tryin' to find a reason
Tryin' to find a reason to stay
Baby, it's just time to walk away

The Last man on earth
Gave him everything she ever had
He'd break her spirit down
Then come lovin' up on her
Give a little, then take it back

She'd tell him 'bout her dreams
He'd just shoot 'em down
Lord he loved to make her cry

You'll ever leave the ground""

She didn't go to church
He wondered why she didn't leave
He went up to the bedroom
Found a note by the window
With the curtains blowin' in the breeze

Had a face of stone 
And a heart of gloom

Cryin' all my tears 
With the curtains drawn

I've got these angels watching over me 

Oh watch me go 
I'm a happy girl 
Everybody knows 
That the sweetest thing you'll ever see 
In the whole wide world 
Is a happy girl 

I used to hide in a party crowd 
Bottled up inside 
Feeling so left out 

Standing in a corner wearing concrete shoes 
With my frozen smile 
And my lighted fuse 

Now every time I start to feel like that 
I roll my heart out like a welcome mat 

Oh watch me go 
I'm a happy girl 
Everybody knows 
That the sweetest thing you'll ever see 
In the whole wide world 
Is a happy girl 

Laugh when I feel like it 
Cry when I feel like it 
That's just how my life is 
That's how it goes 

Oh watch me go

And I've come to know 
That the world won't change 
Just 'cause I complain 
Let the axis twirl

Fall around me like a sun shower
Kiss me like you're on fire

Run with me like a hell bent Gypsy
Scream for me from the highest balcony
Carve my name on an old red door in Spain
Make me immortal, make me immortal in your heart

Show me
I want you to show me
What love is
What love is

Baby, get my attention
Touch me deep inside
Show me what I've been missing
Missing all my life

Give me my finest hour
Give me my ray of light
Give me something that can't be denied

Like a thousand red balloons
In a sapphire sky
A roman candle burning
Burning through the night

Like the pyramids in Egypt
The diamonds in your eyes
Show me
Show me what love is

Like the Eiffel tower shining
With a million lights
Snowflakes falling like confetti
On a New York City night

And to hold on to forever
Newborn babies cry

I want you to show me
What love is

Show me what love is

And that don't cost a dime

It's a big world to walk through honey
And if you got love, you don't need money

And everyone who sees you
Always want's to know you
And everyone that knows you
Always has a smile
You're standing ovation after years of waiting
For a chance to finally shine
Everyone calls you amazing
Yeah
I just call you mine

I fall apart
Just a word from you just somehow seems to fix
Whatever's wrong
Oh, you reach into the weakest moments
And remind me that I'm strong
You've got to know
I'd be a fool not to see you even worse
To forget that you're more than I deserve

Cause everyone who sees you
Always want's to know you
And everyone who knows you
Always have a smile
You're standing ovation after years of waiting

Martina McBride,"She said I'm not pointing fingers,
He said yes you are,
Cause you wouldn't bring it up if you weren't.
And if I'd told you I'd been walking
Out in the dark night thinking
Would you take as truth this alcoholic's word?
Oh I can't change, what's done is done,
But I can tell you this
Not a day goes by that I don't curse myself and all my sins
And I need you to hold on too,
While this part of me is dying
Though I haven't kicked the demons that haunt me,
I'm trying, I'm trying.
She sat down on the floor and said I wish that I was stronger
Right now I feel as fragile as glass.
And I want to believe you,
Believe what's held you has freed you,
And I hate these doubts that keep on comin' back.
My parents think I'm crazy for hangin' on this long,
But there's nothing I want more for us
Than to prove to them they're wrong.
And I don't want to be afraid,
I don't wanna think you're lying,
And though I haven't found the faith that I need,
I'm trying. I'm trying.
He asks do you want me to leave?
Cause if you do you know I will,
But she says, much to his disbelief,
No, I love you still.
Oh, I love you still.
He said I don't know why I've been the fool,
But I can tell you this,
Not a day goes by that I don't curse myself and all my sins.

And you don't want to face the day

To think your world will ever change
You can hide beneath the covers
Or you can run outside head up high and carry on

Life is a roller coaster ride
Time Turns the Wheel and Love Collides
Faith is believing you can close your eyes and touch the sky.
So Shine while you have the chance to shine
Laugh even when you want to cry
Hold on tight to what you feel inside and ride

It brings you up slowly then shoots you like a rocket towards the ground
It twists you and it shakes you before it turns you upside down
You can't see what's around the corner
And You can't look back, so just live it up and feel the rush

Life is a roller coaster ride
Time Turns the Wheel and Love Collides
Faith is believing you can close your eyes and touch the sky.
So Shine while you have the chance to shine
Laugh even when you want to cry
Hold on tight to what you feel inside and ride

Laugh even when you want to cry

When you feel the world shake from the words that are said

And private eyes solve marriage lies cause we don't talk for years

Just take my hand, together we can do it
I'm gonna love you through it.

They said they caught it just in time
But they had to take more than they planned
Now it's forced smiles and baggy shirts
To hide what the cancer took from her
But she just wants to feel like a woman again
She said, ""I don't think I can do this anymore""
He took her in his arms and said
""That's what my love is for""

Martina McBride,"As I walk this land of broken dreams,
I have visions of many things.
Happiness is just an illusion,
Filled with sadness and confusion.

What becomes of the broken hearted
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Maybe.

Fruits of love grow all around
But for me they come a tumblin' down.
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger,
I can't stand this pain much longer!

I walk in shadows,
Searching for light.
Cold and alone,
No comfort in sight.

Hoping and praying for someone to care,
Always moving and goin' nowhere.
What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed?

I know I've got to find,
Some kind of peace of mind.
Help me
I'm searching though I don't succeed,
For someone's love, there's a growing need.

All is lost, there's no place for beginning,
All that's left is an unhappy ending.
What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed?

I know I've got to find,
Some kind of peace of mind,
I'll be searching everywhere,
Just to find someone to care.
I'll be looking everyday,
I know I'm gonna find a way.
Nothings gonna stop me now,
I'll find a way somehow.",What Becomes of the Brokenhearted

And the wind catches your feet
Sends you flyin', cryin'

Ooo-woo-wee!

And all the girls walk by
Dressed up for each other
And the boys do the boogie-woogie
On the corner of the street

And the people, passin' by
Stare in wild wonder

Roars out just like thunder

Hoping to catch it in her sails

Parading around town
With her open wounds
Saying: ""hush now, don't tell a soul,""
Any charity will come too soon
""I can get through this on my own,""
And she's recruiting sympathy like it's an army
And as the front lines fall, she brings new lines up
She says: ""keep on your tip-toes, boys
My tissue's scarring,""
Collecting pity like change in a cup

And she's thrown all caution to the wind
Hoping to catch it in her sails

She won't make it worth her while
She won't let it get her down

Last time that he saw me
It was way back in February
And he was smoking like a chimney
He had me swaying like a daisy
When he said,
""Happy Valentine's day, babe,""

And I walked away

I've pulled it all apart, just for fun
Just to see if it would come undone
Now it's all undone

Now I stay out late at night
I do what the heck I like
Adventurousness is alright, I guess
But I like it less and less
And hey, well, that's exactly
What he warned
He said, ""If you think this happens every day, babe
You've got a lot to learn,""

No room to turn
Let alone run

And I am

Of sunlight on his coat
Livin in a cage make a 7 time daddy
Lose his mind to roam

You keep a-flayin til there's no skin at all

And you fall

De várias idades de muitos amores
Com umas até certo tempo fiquei
Pra outras apenas um pouco me dei

Do tipo acanhada, do tipo vivida
Casada carente, solteira feliz
Já tive donzela e até meretriz

Mulheres cabeças e desequilibradas
Mulheres confusas, de guerra e de paz
Mas nenhuma delas me fez tão feliz como você me faz

Procurei em todas as mulheres a felicidade

Procurei em todas as mulheres a felicidade
Mas eu não encontrei e fiquei na saudade
Foi começando bem mas tudo teve um fim
Você é o sol da minha vida a minha vontade
Você não é mentira você é verdade
É tudo que um dia eu sonhei pra mim.

O tal do samba sincopado
Só não dá pra cantar mesmo

Esse sambinha é da madrugada

Quem não tem vai caminhando

Sobe o rio de jangada

Martinho da Vila,"No cais dourado da velha Bahia
Onde estava o capoeira
A Iaiá também se via
Juntos na feira ou na romaria
No banho de cachoeira
E também na pescaria

Dançavam juntos
Em todo fandango e festinha
E no reisado
Contra mestre e pastorinha

Cantavam, iaiaralaiá, iaiá
Nas festas do alto do Cantuá
Mas loucamente

A Iaiá do cais dourado trocou seu amor
Ardente por um moço requintado
E foi-se embora
Passear de barco à vela
Desfilando em carruagem
Já não era mais aquela

E o capoeira
Que era valente chorou

Até que um dia a mulata
Lá no cais apareceu
Ao ver o seu capoeira
Pra ele logo correu

Pediu guarida
Mas o capoeira não deu
Desesperada
Caiu no mundo a vagar
E o capoeira
Caiu no mundo a vagar

He was richer than a king
We thought that he had everything

We topped the bill but never stayed

Tengo celos hasta del pensamiento
Que pueda recordarte

Mucho tiempo
No has de olvidar el momento
En que yo te conocí

Mírame, pues no hay nada más profundo
Ni más grande en este mundo
Que el cariño que te di
Bésame, con un beso enamorado

Como nadie me ha besado
Desde el día en que nací
Quiéreme, quiéreme hasta la locura

Marty,"Magic mirror come and search my heart
Can you tell me what you see
There's a thousand voices whispering
Songs and you're the melody

So I imagine my heart with you
See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive
Love ecstasy imagining you with me

Many, many days our shadows passed
Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light
And that morning light is you
So I imagine my heart with you

See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive 
love ecstasy imagining you, imagining me
The beauty we both can see

You're the dream I prayed would come along
To make my fantasy
Day and night you live inside my heart
You're the flame of love to me

Marty,"Wastin' my twenties on this God thing
It's what they tell me, like they wanna make my mind change
God saves, just don't question His time frame
Supreme hoodie, pull the strings to cover my face
I been treatin' these planes like it's a bed
Missin' birthdays and Facetimin' instead
I lie about what I do when they ask me
Sometimes I think my family is happier without me, me
I haven't been myself in weeks now
I'm runnin' by myself in these streets now
No apologies for bein' me now
Only makin' songs if I'm killin' every beat now
I never live by the compliments
Twenty-seven, unmarried, still livin' at my father's place
I promise to take care of them when I get rich
These record execs look like Harvey Dents
It's a new era of the misfit
Everything switched, rather be happy than get rich
And growin' up, to me, is like a death wish
Gave my purity away, I wish I woulda kept it
Only makin' songs that I like
Instagram is not real, it's just highlights
And rappers talkin' crazy about my life
When I see them in person it's, ""Whaddup?"", high five
They like, ""Why you make these silly songs?""
'Cause I'm bored of everything that my city does
I don't make songs for the radio
'Cause I don't talk about pretty women and dealin' drugs
So shoutout to suburbia
If you're ain't from here, chances are we never heard of ya
It's like I was raised in the old school
Where haters talk about you like they know you, you
I probly shoulda died in '02
Labels sayin' that we killin' things, I'm like, ""Oh, shoot!""
I'm 'posed to, I'm goin' postal
And if you need some dope music we the go to
The Social Club boys are in the buildin'
Dad's Puerto Rican and my mom's side's Sicilian
Which means when I'm talkin' they assume that I'm yellin'
I wanna shift culture for all my independents
This is the land of the free
Anti-Christian celebrity
Those bright lights weren't meant for me
My God's not dead and He still reigns supreme
Close my eyes, I see stadiums
Performin' when nobody was payin' 'em
Thank God his parents never stopped prayin' for 'em
The world didn't understand him, so instead they hated on 'em

After the show, when the room was empty
No, he wouldnt go
So I asked him why he called her name

Let me ride through the wide open country that I love
Don't fence me in

Let me be by myself in the evening breeze
And listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever but I ask you please
Don't fence me in

Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle on
Underneath the western skies
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder
Till I see the mountains rise

I want to ride to the ridge where the West commences
Gaze at the moon till I lose my senses
And I can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences

Oh I never really know quite what to expect
But it won't get me down

'Cause I know you bring each and every thing
Just to teach me how to live
And the secret of it all is trusting in you
And the wisdom to give

So say goodbye to the feelings 'cause the feelings go away
Say goodbye to the people 'cause the people never stay
And say goodbye to the future when it blinds you today
Say goodbye to the reasoning that's standing in the way
'Cause we've got to break away
Break away to be

Faith-talkin' people, we must discern what's really real

Faith-talkin' people seems like such a mystery

But in all the earth there is nothing worth
Half as much as life with you
'Cause the people and the things we're counting on here
They're gonna pass away too

I don't understand everything is planned
But I don't really have to know
'Cause he's giving me a joy that's filling my heart
When I learn to let go

So say goodbye to the feelings 'cause the feelings go away
Say goodbye to the people 'cause the people never stay
And say goodbye to the future when it blinds you today
Say goodbye to the reasoning that's standing in the way

With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by

Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,

And sunlight beams on clover-leaf and pine.
But other lands have sunlight too and clover,
And skies are everywhere as blue as mine.

I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left

Tripping in the starlight, Lord and I'm feeling down
Walking in the shadows, sneaking down a side road
Come early morning I'll be there on the edge of town

I was a thinking, thinking about a good thing
Thinking bout a sweet dream, in my honey's eyes
And I was a sinking', feeling kind of lonesome
Come early morning I'll be home at my honey's side

I have drifted up across the mountain
and I have stumbled down the other side
And I've been tempted, tried and troubled

She just walked right out the door she didn't say goodbye

Loving her gives me the right to miss her like I do
And it gives me a right to be as blue as I want to
I don't want too much of this my heart's about to die
Oh don't you think I've got a right to cry

She walked off and left me with a great big bunch of hurt
And don't you know she walked on me like I was so much dirt
What a lousy way to thank me after how I've tried

",Don't You Think
Marty Robbins,"Faith makes me believe behind the darkest cloud
There's a brighter ray of sun
And if today's not quite as good as yesterday
Tomorrow has yet to come
And I believe each time you reach a mountain top
With faith you see below
A green and shaded valley where
A peaceful gentle river flows

But it takes faith to climb each mountain
It takes faith to climb each mountain
It takes faith to climb each mountain
And it takes faith to face this life

Faith makes me believe for every stormy sea
A peaceful ocean rolls
And I believe for every tree that falls
Another tree will grow
And I believe when faith is used it gives
Us strength to have the things we need
The way the sun will give a rose the strength
It takes to grow up through the weeds

But it takes faith to climb each mountain
It takes faith to climb each mountain
It takes faith to climb each mountain
And it takes faith to face this life
It takes faith to face this life

My way of puttin' the bread on the table at home

First place could be just a dream but I'm gonna chase it
Finishing out of the top ten is nothing but bad
And a junker won't ever be first I might as well face it

And my woman cries with each goodbye kiss that I give her
And she prayes that come Monday morning and I'll be driftin' home

Well my woman sleeps in my arms and I lie here thinkin'
Half awake half asleep I run and re-run the race
From dark end till dawn it goes on my half awake dreamin'
And ever so often I dream of me taking first place

It's got to be more than a dream dreamin' won't make it
Or dreaming won't ever put bread on the table at home
And racing runs deep in my veins and I'll never shake it
I'm tied to it just like I'm tied to the woman at home

",Two Gun Daddy
Marty Robbins,"Out in the west Texas town of El Paso I fell in love with a Mexican girl.
Nighttime would fine me in Rosa's Cantina,
Music would play and Felina would whirl.

Black as the night were the eyes of Felina,
Wicked and evil while casting a spell.
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden,
I was in love, but in vain I could tell.

One night a wild young cowboy came in, wild as the west Texas wind...
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing,
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love.

So in anger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden;
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore.
My challenge was answered, in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor.

Just for a moment I stood there in silence,
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done.
Many thoughts ran through my mind as I stood there;
I had but one chance and that was to run.

Out through the back door of rose's I ran, out where the horses were tied
I picked a good one; he looked like he could run,
Up on his back and away I did ride.

Just as fast as I could from the west Texas town of El Paso,
Out through the badlands of New Mexico.
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless;
Everything's gone in life nothing is left.

But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden,
My love is stronger that my fear of death.
I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark...
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me,
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart.

And as last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso,
I can see Rosa's Cantina below.
My love is strong and it pushes me onward, down off the hill to Felina I go.

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys,
Off to my left ride a dozen or more.
Shouting and shooting; I can't let them catch me,
I've got to make it to rose's back door.

Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel 
A deep burning pain in my side. 
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle, 
I'm getting weary, unable to ride. 
But my love for 
Felina is strong and I writhe where I've fallen. 
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest 

I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle,
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest.
From out of nowhere, Felina has found me,
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side.
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for,
One little kiss and Felina good-bye.",ElPaso
Marty Robbins,"I'm as sad as the willow
That weeps in the valley
Since you've gone,
Since you've gone from my arms

I'm as sad as the cold wind
That rythes in the treetops,
I'll be lonesome until you return

Come back, come back,
Come back to the valley,
Come back to this poor cowboy's arms

I will weep like the willow
That weeps in the valley,
I'll be lonesome until you return

Come back to the valley,
Come back to this poor cowboy's arms

Marty Robbins,"When I was but a young man,I was wild and full of fire
A youth within my teens, but full of challenge and desire
I ran away from home and left my mother and my dad
I know it grieved them so to think their only boy went bad

I fell in with an outlaw band, their names were known quite well
How many times we robbed and plundered, I could never tell
This kind of sinful living, leads only to a fall
I learned that much and more the night I heard my Master's call
 
One night we rustled cattle, a thousand head or so
And started then out on the trail that leads to Mexico
When a norther started blowing and lightning flashed about
I thought someone was calling me, I thought I heard a shout
 
Then at that moment lightning struck not twenty yards from me
And left there was a giant cross where once there was a tree
This time I knew I heard a voice, a voice so sweet and strange
A voice that came from everywhere, a voice that called my name
 
So frightened I was thinking of sinful deeds I'd done
I failed to see the thousand head of cattle start to run
The cattle they stampeded, were running all around
My pony ran but stumbled and it threw me to the ground
 
I felt the end was near, that death would be the price
When another bolt of lightning showed the face of Jesus Christ
And I cried oh Lord forgive me, don't let it happen now
I want to live for you alone, Oh God these words I vow
 
My wicked past unfolded and I thought of wasted years
When another bolt of lightning killed a hundred head of steers
And the others rushed on by me and I was left to live
The Master had a reason,life is his to take or give 
 
A miracle performed that night, I wasn't meant to die
The dead ones formed a barricade nearly six or seven high
And right behind it there was I, afraid but safe and sound
I cried in vain for mercy kneeling there upon the ground
 
A pardon I was granted, my sinful soul set free
No more to fear the angry waves upon life's stormy seas
Forgiven by the love of God, a love that will remain
I learned that much and more the night the Saviour called my name",The Master’sCall

Set out to find the gambler

Who murdered their pa

Five brothers and three in their teens

Who killed their pa in New Orleans


They heard of him in Houston

And his trail was leadin' west

He'd left there many months ago

And so they couldn't rest

Five brothers and three in their teens

Gotta find the man

Who killed their pa in New Orleans

The sun was hot as fire

And the nights were cold as steel

Hate was strong and youth was wild

And so they couldn't feel

Gotta find the man

His trail led to the Badlands

And the desert promised death

The gambler's odds were different now

He treasured every breath

Close behind the man

Who killed their pa in New Orleans

When first they saw the killer

He was by the waterhole

Five rifles rang out through the night

They killed the gambler cold

Five brothers and three in their teens

Finally got the man

Who killed their pa in New Orleans


The desert is their keeper now

For this a traveler said

That poison lived within the hole

Now six of them are dead

Lay beside the man

Who killed their pa in New Orleans

Lay beside the man

Marty Robbins,"North of the border of Old Mexico
I rode one day to the cowtown of San Angelo
A hot sun was glowing, a hot breeze was blowing
Still not as warm as the lips that I waited to kiss

She sent a message a long time ago
Secora had promised to meet me in San Angelo
I was aware of the chance I was taking
I was an outlaw but great was my love for this girl 

I must be with her I can't stay away
Nights spent without her are lonely and so are the days
If it means death then I'll have to chance it
Only a few minutes more and she'll be at my side

At ten o' clock in the morning
I tied my horse and I started to walk down the street
Where was Secora, had she forgotten
This was the day and the hour that she wanted to meet
But something is wrong with our plans and I fear death awaits me
Here on this hot dusty street. 

Up on a housetop but still I can see
There hides a man with a rifle, it's pointed at me
I might escape from the man with a rifle
But there are others just like him that I cannot see 

Back of each window the click of a gun
Die if I stay and my love for her won't let me run
Where is Secora, will my eyes see her
Then in a moment she runs from a door down the street 

""Up on your horse"", she is crying
""Ride out of town it's a trap and they're waiting for you""
But if I ride out, she must ride with me
Then in a moment I know that our chances are gone
For a bullet is well on its way and it finds my Secora
She cries as she falls in my arms 

Over and over her soft lips did say
""Now we're together, I won't let them take you away""
One little sigh, her little lips tremble
Then it was over, Secora had drifted away 

Tears dim my vision but plainly I see
The ranger that killed her is standing there waiting for me
I rise to meet him, my one thought it beat him
He deserves death and I swear that this ranger will die 

I beat his draw and I shot him
Shot him six times just as fast as the bullets could fly
My gun is empty or more I would shoot him
Now there are others just like him that want me to die
Their bullets are coming my way, how they hurt when they hit me
The pain makes me fall to the ground. 

Gone is my strength, just the will left to fight
I hear the sound of the lead as it robs me of life
If I must die, let me find Secora
Let me hold on to her hand for the few moments left 

Blindly I search and it isn't in vain
I touch the soft velvet hand and it eases the pain
Life is no more but we're together
Even in death she's my lover,
It's over,
Goodbye",San Angelo

She was all a man could ask for but her heart could not be true
No her heart could not be true
Eyes that sparkle just like diamonds lips as fresh as morning dew

She was young and she was fickle and her heart could not be true
No her heart could not be true
Cheeks just like a rose when blooming and a form so fine and rare
Curls that hung below her shoulders gold the color of her hair

Now she's gone no one can claim her in my cell I'm sad and blue
One bright night I shot and killed her she was young and so untrue
She was young and so untrue
One bright night I watched another kissed her like I used to do

So I drew my gun and killed her she was young and so untrue
In the morning just at daybreak when the roses kissed the dew
I shall hang because I killed her she was young and so untrue

Fair as the sweetest flower bloomin' in the shade
She loved a bandit bold who roamed the prairie o'er

Hee li oli yip ioli yip ay oli ya he brings a token of his love
Swift as the wind he goes for high as the hills he knows she's waiting

One day he rode away but never to return
Danger was waitin' now his love must never yearn
Long days and lonely nights she waited all in vain

'Til winter passed and summer came again
Still every night when the moon came shining for his song her heart was pining
Hee li oli yip ioli ay
Hee li oli yip ioli...

One night an angel brought a message from her love
Told her he waited in the starry sky above
Softly she closed her eyes and bade the angel go
And then the whole world echoed to his song

For straight down a moonbeam he came ridin' out of the sky on a winged horse glidin' Hee li oli yip ioli ay

No money to jingle as I ride along

I'm broke but I'm wealthy because I am free
Let me walk in this valley where my fathers had trod
Let me live forever on this peaceful sod

Till I'm meek and I'm humble and the Lord wants my soul

",This Peaceful Sod
Marty Robbins,"To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say,
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
""He's an outlaw loose and runnin'"",  came a whisper from each lip
""And he's here to do some business with a big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip""

In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more,
One and nineteen more

Now the stranger started talkin' made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizonia ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He was here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter that he was after Texas Red,
After Texas Red

Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry, men who tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip,
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

Now the morning passed so quickly and it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they rode out in the street
Folks were watchin' from their windows,
Every body held their breath,
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death,
About to meet his death

There was twenty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

It was over in a moment and the crowd all gathered 'round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on livin' but he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip,

I told my heart it's best that we part

How silly to even begin
If I win, if I lose, or if I sing the blues
I must play the game to the end

Begging you to stay but still you go this time you won't be back I know
Just like all the other times I cry had that same old hurt deep down inside
Lonely nights for me are nothing new lonely every night since I lost you
It's my fault because I've lost but I just couldn't see
If I'd been a man I should you'd still be here with me
But I guess it's always been this way when you break a heart you have'll to pay

Marty Robbins,"Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I loved

So in anger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor

Just for a moment I stood there In silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one, it looked like it could run
Up on its back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico

Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone, in life nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

I saddled up and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And at last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosa's back door

Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride

But my love for Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss, then Felina good-bye",El Paso
Marty Robbins,"From this valley they say you are leaving
We shall miss your bright eyes and sweet smile
For you take with you all of the sunshine
That has brightened our pathway a while

Then come sit by my side if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
Just remember the Red River Valley
And the cowboy that's loved you so true

For a long time, my darlin', I've waited
For the sweet words you never would say
Now at last all my fond hopes have vanished
For they say that you're going away

Then come sit by my side if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
Just remember the Red River Valley
And the cowboy that's loved you so true",Red River Valley
Marty Robbins,"Ride, cowboy, ride
Don't ride too slow
Tucson's a mighty long way yet to go
He started his long ride in Prescott
The sun was a hundred or more
On down he rode at full gallop
Into the flat desert floor
Driving the big herd to Flagstaff
In Prescott the letter was there
Happiness soon would be sorrow
Sad news the letter did bear
Ride, cowboy, ride
Don't go too slow

Racked by fever and pain

At each breath she's callin' your name

Pushing through mesquite and sage
His head never raised for a greeting
As he passed the Wickenburg stage
Ride, cowboy, ride
Don't ride too slow
Tucson's a mighty long way to go
In Phoenix he traded horses
Now on the back of this roan
He could see visions of Tucson
His darlin' and their lovely home
Ride, cowboy, ride
Don't ride too slow
There's still a hundred and twenty to go
In through the ranch gate he galloped
And without breaking his stride
He bounded out of the saddle
And rushed to his sweet darlin's side
Then as the dyin' girl saw him
A smile came over her face
Holding her hand as it tightened
Barely had he won the race

Might even whisper her name

As I walked out in Laredo one day
I saw a young cowboy, wrapped all in white linen
Wrapped in white linen, as cold as the clay

Oh, beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly
Sing the Death March as you carry me along
Take me to the valley, there lay the sod o'er me
I'm a young cowboy, I know I've done wrong

I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy
These words he did say as I boldly walked by
Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story
Got shot in the breast and I know I must die

Go fetch me some water, a cool cup of water
To cool my parched lips, then the poor cowboy said
Before I returned, his spirit had left him
Had gone to his Maker, the cowboy was dead

And I found a girl who loved just me
and I wished that I could love her, too

And it happened just that way with me
They took my gold and set me free

Or it might be the sound of your hello
This music I hear I get misty whenever you're near
You can say that you lead me on but it's just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost that's why I'm following you

On my own would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left, my hat from my glove
I'm so misty and so much in love
You can say that you lead me on...
Misty and so much in love",Misty
Marty Robbins,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street

The breakers play on coral sands that say
We'll bring her home again the wind, the sea and me

Marty Robbins,"I fell in love the night I came ashore
You're what I'd wanted what I'd waited for
I built my dreams too high it seems that now
The things I wanted turned out wrong somehow

The dawn will find me sailing back to sea
But I when I sail I'll leave a part of me
Though you're untrue what can I do I love you
I can't forget you o'er the night I came ashore

The dawn will find me sailing back to sea...




",The Down Where the Trade Winds Blow
Marty Robbins,"Last night, all alone in the barroom
I met a girl with a drink in her hand
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair
And eyes that would tempt any man

She came and sat down at my table
And when she put her soft hand in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine

And I was almost persuaded
To strip my self of my pride
Almost persuaded
To push my conscience aside

We danced and she whispered, ?I need you
Take me away from here and be my man?
Then as I looked in her eyes, I saw it
The reflection of my wedding band

And I was almost persuaded
To let strange lips lead me on
Almost persuaded
But your sweet love made me stop and go home
",Almost Persuaded
Marty Robbins,"I don't ask you ,Lord, to lighten up my burden
I don't mind the trials on earth that I go through
Beyond doubt, I want to prove that I am worthy
Of a little spot in Heaven close to you

Years ago my Mother taught me all your meaning
Of the hardship and the pain that you went through
Know you ,Lord, that I am ready and I'm waiting
For a little spot in Heaven close to you

Precious Lord, forget me not don't pass me by
Though there must be others worthier than I
If you can then, Lord, here's what I'll have you do
Save a little spot in Heaven close to you

If my wish is more than I deserve, forgive me
Up in Heaven any place would surely do
But I've done my best on earth that's why I'm asking
For a little spot in Heaven close to you

At the altar years ago we got acquainted
And as time went on the love in my heart grew
If it isn't asking too much, Lord, then save me
Just a little spot in Heaven close to you

A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply as time goes by
And when two lovers woo
They still say ""I love you""
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings, as time goes by
Moonlight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy, and hate

I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning

Marty Robbins,"Some people say that she's really no good
Others have said she drinks more than she should
And that it's hopeless and really no good
To be in love with her

She got the worst of a careless romance
Love's little arrow was more like a lance
But still I'm happy and I'm glad for the chance
To be in love with her

She tells too many jokes she takes too many smokes
Spends her money much too fast
She still has her pride and she's only tryin' to hide
Disappointments of the past

Maybe she's seen with the wrong kind of crowd
Maybe she laughs just a little too loud
I know she's good and I know that I'm proud

I should have known you'd come my way
Since she left me

Why do you fall like winter rain?
It's too late now
For she won't be back again
And there's nothing you can do
To ease this longing in my heart
For I'll miss her just as long as we're apart 

** For awhile I thought she loved me
All of that is over now
And I tried to make her happy
But I failed her somewhere, somehow

Were are the shining stars above?
Do you miss them
As I'll always miss my love?

All night long until the dawn
For I know that I can't sleep now that she's gone.

I ended up in a little Mexican town
Was there I met a lovely senorita
There she offered her heart if I promised I'd settle down

As I rode away with tears in her eyes she was pleading
I can still see her tears I can still hear the words she said
Don't go away senor don't go away
Don't go away senor don't go away don't go away don't go away

Guess my wanderin' is through I just can't forget her

There's nothin' to do but ride back south of the border
And beg her forgiveness and never wander again

My eyes look but they don't see...

Today was to be a day of fun and fiesta
The wedding day of Juan and lovely Vanessa
Inside the chapel only the padre remains
Everyone waited but Vanessa she never came.

Oh, only sorrow at the mission in Guadalajara
No fiesta, no laughing, no singing
No wedding bells will be ringing
Only sorrow in Guadalajara.

And every year on that very same day in September
He lights a candle and prays that she will remember
Inside the chapel he begs the padre to stay
He swears Vanessa will surely be here today.

No fiesta, no laughing, no singing
No wedding bells will be ringing
Only sorrow in Guadalajara.

But to this cruel world I'll soon say my farewell at last
I will be gone when you'll read this last letter from me

When you are lonely and tired of another man's gold
When you are lonely remember this letter my own
But don't try to answer though I've suffered anguish untold
If you don't love me I just wish you would leave me alone",The Last Letter
Marty Robbins,"Let me live in your world for a day
Even though I know my heart will fail
A lonely soul in search of happiness
Has found the world of heaven in your kiss

I knew someday someway I'd find a thrill
But finding love there too doesn't seem real
I know it's wrong and you won't let me stay
But let me live in your world for a day

And that day I know I found the way
Of living in my world so far away
Love me now and then send me away
But let me live in your world for a day




",Let Me Live in Your World
Marty Robbins,"I grew up in Alabama in a valley I called home
And I learned to love sweet lily from the start
But I had to do my duty yes I had to do my part
But the thought of leaving really breaks my heart
If this war could just be over and I could go back home
If I could hold and kiss her once again
Then if I should die tomorrow after loving her tonight
Then I would not feel my life had been in vain
Cause she's my lily of the valley and I want her for my wife
She's my lily of the valley I guess I've loved lily almost all my life all my life

Just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I rang her number by mistake today

Just because I haunt the same old places
Where the mem'ry of her lingers ev'rywhere
Just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be

She thinks I still care
But if she's happy thinkin' I still need her
Then let that silly notion bring her cheer
But how could she ever be so foolish

Just because I saw her then went all to pieces

But I knew her love would never set me free
And even on the morning she became another's bride
I said they'd never never take her love from me

I'm so thankful for each golden hour of happiness

I'm right back where I've really always been

Concerning a great speckled bird 
Remember her name is recorded 
On the pages of God's Holy Word. 
2. All the other birds are flocking 'round her 
She is despised by the squad 
But the great speckled bird in the Bible 
Representing the great church of God. 
3. All the other churches are against her 
They envy her glory and fame 
They hate her because she is chosen 
And has not denied Jesus' name. 
4. Desiring to lower her standard 
They watch every move that she makes 
They long to find fault with her teachings 
But really they find no mistake. 
5. She is spreading her wings for a journey 
She's going to leave by and by 
When the trumpet shall sound in the morning 
She'll rise and go up in the sky. 
6. In the presence of all her despisers 
With a song never uttered before 
She will rise and be gone in a moment 
Till the great tribulation is o'er. 
7. I am glad I have learned of her meekness 
I am proud that my name is on her book 
For I want to be one never fearing 
The face of my Savior true love.

On the cloud that He writes in His Word 
I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him

Brings my cup of coffee to my bed
And her silken nightdress brushes cross my chest as she bends down
And last night's mem'ries rush into my head
With her kiss she makes me feel that even if the sun would go away then
Everything would still be just fine
And it's such a shame that every man can't start the day
With early morning sunshine but she's mine

She gives up her smile so easy and it makes the day go better
She's brightened every night we've ever known
Her hands are so warm and gentle she brushes my cheek softly
It's so good to know sunshine is my own
We've been through so much together all the joy and tears and laughter
And we've been so down we didn't have a dime

If you could imagine some things that I've had to go through
Perhaps you'd remember I'm doing them all just for you
But you don't see the bars you can't hear that big iron gate

Said, the city life was what she wanted more

For three years now I watched alone and waited
Somethin' told me that I would see her once again

Today I'm gonna drive down to the station
And I'll pick her up and bring her home at last
So often I've said that I'd forgive her
For anything that's happened in the past

Last week I got a letter from the city
Sayin' they were going to send me what was mine
She's commin' back to stay here in the valley
She's returning in a simple box of pine

Even though my heart would break
And I'll give her flowers like I used to give her

Some mornin' and be lookin' in some old and wrinkled face

For no one else can kiss me like you can
And all the time you're tryin' to reassure me
That my youth ain't dyin' now
That I'll never be too old
That I'll always be this much a man

No more from life than I can give

They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.

Marty Robbins,"[Chorus]
Well I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old juke box
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone singing
Hey, hey, mama can your daddy come home

Now I'm living wild and dangerously
But I've got plenty of company
When the moon comes up and the sun goes down
I can't wait to see the lights of town

[Chorus]

A pretty little girl and a jug of wine
Well that's what it takes to make a honky tonk time
With the juke box moaning those honky tonk sounds
I can't wait to lay my money down

Marty Robbins,"""I'm not in your town to stay,""
Said a lady old and gray
To the warden of the penitentiary
""I'm not in your town to stay
and I'll soon be on my way
I'm just here to get my baby out of jail
Oh warden, I'm just here to get my baby out of jail""

""I tried to raise my baby right
I have prayed both day and night
That he wouldn't follow the footsteps of his dad
I have searched both far and wide
and I feared that he had died
But at last I've found my baby here in jail
Oh warden, at last I've found my baby here in jail""

""It was just five years today
When his daddy passed away
He was found beneath the snow so cold and white
'Twas then I vowed to take his ring
and his gold watch and his chain
and the county laid his daddy in the grave
Yes warden, the county laid his daddy in the grave""

""I will pawn you his watch
I will pawn you his chain
I will pawn you my diamond wedding ring
I will wash all your clothes
I will scrub all your floors
If that will get my baby out of jail
Yes warden, if that will get my baby out of jail""

Then I heard the warden say
To the lady old and gray:
""I'll go bring your darlin' baby to your side""
2 iron gates swang wide apart
She held her darlin' to her heart
She kissed her baby boy and then she died
But smiling, she kissed her baby boy and then she died

""I'm not in your town to stay,""
Said a lady old and gray
""I'm just here to get my baby out of jail

Marty Robbins,"Hands that are strong but wrinkled
Doing work that never gets done
Hair, that's lost some of the beauty
By too many hours in the sun

Eyes, that show some disappointment
And there's been quite a lot in her life
She's the foundation I lean on
My woman, my woman, my wife

Everyday has been uphill
Oh, we climb but we can't reach the top
I'm weak and I'm easily discouraged
She just smiles when I want to stop

Lips, that are weary but tender
With love, that strengthens my life
A saint, in a dress made of gingham
My woman, my woman, my wife

Two little babies were born in the spring
But died when the winter was new
I lost control of my mind and my soul
But my woman's faith carried us through

When she reaches that river
Lord, you know what she's worth
Give her that mansion up yonder
'Cause she's been through hell here on earth

Lord, give her my share of Heaven
If I've earned any here in this life
'Cause God, I believe she deserves it

Another mountain yet to climb
Lord if there's still another mountain
Don't make it quite as high this time

Lord give me no more raging rivers
Give me a valley cool and green
Lord if there has to be a river
Make it a calm and peaceful stream

And Lord if each mountain is only a test
Do you mind if I stop for a moment and rest
And Lord let me look at the blue in the sky
And if I'm your child wipe these tears from my eyes

Marty Robbins,"Last night I come home and I knocked on my door
I called to my love as I oft had before
I knocked and I knocked but no answer it came
No kisses to greet me no voice called my name

I couldn't believe it was true oh Lord I couldn't believe it was true
My eyes filled with tears I must have aged ten years
I couldn't believe it was true
I let myself in and I walk to our bed

I found a note there and the message it read
The truth like a bolt from the blue in the dawn
My sweetheart had left me my darling had gone
I couldn't believe it was true oh Lord...

Marty Robbins,"I left my home town
Turned a good woman down
Even laughed at my own Mother's plea
I pushed her aside
Even laughed when she cried

Her love has stood the test

But youth's full of fire
Challenge and desire
Now I'm here in this penitentary

I fell in you see with bad company
And I started in gamblin' for fun
One night when the cards
Had been dealt and I'd lost
I backed up my play with a gun

I shot and I killed

Marty Robbins,"One starry night in a little town in old Mexico
I found my love down by the sea where soft trade winds blow
She came in the night with perfume that sweetened the air
And I lost my heart to the girl with gardenias in her hair

I glanced her way she smiled and my heart started to sing
She came into my arms and the night became a sweet magic thing
When I held her close I knew I'd follow her anywhere
And I lost my heart to the girl with gardenias in her hair

We shared through the night our love until the first light of dawn
Then one last kiss and like a whisper on the wind she was gone
I go each night to the places where she once spoke my name

Tonight Carmen's coming back home
Tonight there'll be no room for tears in my bedroom

Tonight Carmen's coming back home.
Tonight as I stand here I notice my hand here
Is trembling as never before
My feelings I can't hide, resistance has all died

My pride will rush outside
The moment she walks through the door.
The lips that have kissed her,
That's loved her and missed her

Are lips that have cursed her at night
In anguish and torment, I've cursed as the night went
From darkness till dawn's golden light
I thought of just taking these two hands and breaking

The body I'm waiting to touch
I find while I'm waiting, there's no time for hating
While anticipating, the woman I've wanted so much.
I've placed pretty flowers to brighten the hours

I put brand new sheets on the bed
I'm nervous, I'm trembling, recalling remembering
The way that she tosses her head.
I've given much thought to the fact that I ought to

Have more control over my life
How can I fight it, how can I deny it,
There's no way to hide it
The love that I have for my wife.

I'm gonna miss the sunshine of your smile

Because my heart will be with you each passing mile

Turn around and ride right back to me again

",I'm Gonna Miss You When You Go
Marty Robbins,"I'll sing you a true song of Billy the Kid
I'll sing of some desperate deeds that he did
'Way out in New Mexico long long ago
When a man's only chance was his own forty-four.
When Billy the Kid was a very young lad
In old Silver City he went to the bad
'Way out in the West with a gun in his hand
At the age of twelve years he did kill his first man.

There's Mexican maidens play guitars and sing
Songs about Billy, their boy bandit king
'Ere his young manhood has reached his sad end
With a notch an his pistol for twenty one men!
Was on a sad night when poor Billy died
He said to his friend, ""I'm not satisfied
There's twenty one men I have put bullets through
Sheriff Pat Garrett must make twenty two!""

I'll sing you how Billy the Kid met his fate
The bright moon was shinin', the hour was late
Shot down by Pat Garrett who once was his friend
The young outlaw's life is now come to an end.
There's many a man with a face fine and fair
Who start out in life with a chance to be square
Just like poor Billy they wander astray
They'll lose their lives in the very same way!",Billy the Kid

Without the taste of water, cool water
Old Dan and I with throats burned dry
And souls that cry for water

Cool water
And with the dawn I'll wake and yawn
And carry on to water, cool clear water

He's a devil, not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water
Dan, can ya see that big, green tree?
Where the water's runnin' free
And it's waitin' there for you and me?

Tonight we pray for water

And way up there he'll hear our prayer
And show us where
There's water, cool clear water

Along that dusty trail I'll take my stand
The steers are big and bold and the nights are often cold
But I'll get by so long as I can

I got no home I got no wife but I'll be a doggone cowboy all of my life

I'm up at the crack of dawn and I throw the bacon on
Seems somehow my work is never through
When I get done at night all the stars are big and bright
But then that's sorta what you're used to when you

Throw that rope and brand that calf dream of a girl in a photograph

With just an old campfire to keep me warm
I'll move the herd along and I'll greet them with a song

Marty Robbins,"Down in the little Mexican town of New Wavo
There lived a maiden lovely as a rose
Deep was the love of Lisa, the rose of New Wavo
For Johnny Fedavo and he loved her too
They made a vow that they'd always love each other
For them, on other could be so true

Storm clouds swept in the life of Johnny Fedavo
The promise of Heaven lasted for just a day
God needed someone to brighten his throne
Lisa was taken and Johnny was left all alone

That day in the little Mexican town of New Wavo
Sadly, a village laid their rose away
Johnny came home but no Lisa was there to meet him
No arms to greet him or hold him tight
Johnny prayed alone for God to hear it
To take his spirit away that night

The years passed by and no one saw Johnny Fedavo
The children grew and people were gay once more
One day they found him with hair snowy white
The rose in his hand was his message to Lisa that night

Down in the little Mexican town of New Wavo
Two lovers at last their peace with God have found
Deep was the love of Lisa, the rose of New Wavo
For Johnny Fedavo and he loved her too
There in the chapel shadows they both lay sleeping
Their vows still keeping and both still true

It's an eagle that circles above me 
And he screams to his friends on the hill 
""Stay close together, move not a feather 
Man walks among us, be still, be still 
Man walks among us, be still"" 

Everything hides, but I see them 
I've spotted an old mother quail 
I look close and see, looking right back at me 
The eyes of a young cottontail 
I see a coyote sneaking 
As he crawls through the brush on the hill 
And the eagle screams down, ""Stay close to the ground 
Man walks among us, be still, be still 
Man walks among us, be still."" 

Twenty feet high in the side of a cactus 
I see a hole where the butcher bird stays 
If mortals could choose, and if heaven should ask us 
Here's where I'd want to spend all of my days

Cities will cover each hill 
Today will just be a fond memory

Marty Robbins,"When I was but a young man,I was wild and full of fire
A youth within my teens, but full of challenge and desire
I ran away from home and left my mother and my dad
I know it grieved them so to think their only boy went bad

I fell in with an outlaw band, their names were known quite well
How many times we robbed and plundered, I could never tell
This kind of sinful living, leads only to a fall
I learned that much and more the night I heard my Master's call
 
One night we rustled cattle, a thousand head or so
And started then out on the trail that leads to Mexico
When a norther started blowing and lightning flashed about
I thought someone was calling me, I thought I heard a shout
 
Then at that moment lightning struck not twenty yards from me
And left there was a giant cross where once there was a tree
This time I knew I heard a voice, a voice so sweet and strange
A voice that came from everywhere, a voice that called my name
 
So frightened I was thinking of sinful deeds I'd done
I failed to see the thousand head of cattle start to run
The cattle they stampeded, were running all around
My pony ran but stumbled and it threw me to the ground
 
I felt the end was near, that death would be the price
When another bolt of lightning showed the face of Jesus Christ
And I cried oh Lord forgive me, don't let it happen now
I want to live for you alone, Oh God these words I vow
 
My wicked past unfolded and I thought of wasted years
When another bolt of lightning killed a hundred head of steers
And the others rushed on by me and I was left to live
The Master had a reason,life is his to take or give 
 
A miracle performed that night, I wasn't meant to die
The dead ones formed a barricade nearly six or seven high
And right behind it there was I, afraid but safe and sound
I cried in vain for mercy kneeling there upon the ground
 
A pardon I was granted, my sinful soul set free
No more to fear the angry waves upon life's stormy seas
Forgiven by the love of God, a love that will remain
I learned that much and more the night the Saviour called my name",The Master's Call
Marty Robbins,"Old Red was one of the orneriest yet 
I've seen at the big rodeo 
He'd bite you and kick you and stomp out your life 
Old Red had never been rode 

Meaner than sin, wild as the wind 
That blew on the Montana plain 
Old Red was one of the last of his breed 
And wasn't about to be tamed 

From Idaho a young cowboy came 
To ride in the big rodeo 
The young cowboy's name was Billy McClain 
And Billy had never been thrown 

The greatest desire filling young Billy's heart 
To ride this old outlaw called Red 
He drew him one day and I heard Billy say 
""I'll ride him or drop over dead"" 

Old Red was wicked down there in the chute 
He was kicking and stomping about 
Billy climbed in to the saddle with ease 
Then yelled ""Turn him loose, let us out"" 

Old Red came out with his head on the ground 
His back hooves were touching his nose 
Tryin' to get rid of the man on his back 
But the man went wherever he'd go 

Billy was rakin' Old Red with his spurs 
From his tail to the tip of his chin 
He was doin' right well, but Billy could tell 
This outlaw would never give in 

Old Red was runnin' straight for the fence 
Suddenly stoppin' and then 
He reared on his hind legs and fell on his back 
Takin' poor Billy with him 

There was a hush in the crowd and they knew 
This would be Billy's last ride 
The saddle horn crushed Billy's chest when they fell 
And under Old Red Billy died 

Old Red lay still, no more would he move 
The cowboys that seen it could tell 
In tryin' to throw Billy off of his back 
Old Red broke his neck when he fell 

Out in the West is the place where they rest 
This cowboy that never was thrown 
And one foot away restin' there 'neath the clay 
Is the outlaw that never was rode",Old Red

I was, running dodging danger,left the, girl that I loved so
Far behind lay Kansas City and the, past that I had earned
Twenty, notches on my six gun marked the, lessons I had learned

Many times I sold my fast gun for a, place to lay my head
Till the, nights began to haunt me by the, men that I lay dead
Couldn't, stand it any longer with the, life that I'd begun
So I, said good-bye to Jeannie and, became a running gun

I rode into Amarillo as the sun sank in the west

As I smiled and kissed her gently and then turned around to go
Said I'd send for her to meet me when I reached old Mexico

I had barely left the saddle and my foot just touched the ground
When a cold voice from the shadows told me not to turn around
Said he new about my fast gun,new the price paid by the law
Challenged by a bounty hunter,so I turned around to draw

I knew someday I'd meet him for his hand like lightning flashed
My own gun stayed in leather as his bullet tore it's path
As my strength was slowly fading,I could see him walk away
And I knew that where I lie today,he to must lie some day

Now my strength is slowly fading and my eyes are growing dim
And my thoughts return to Jeannie
and the home that we had planned
Oh please tell her won't you mister
that she's still the only one
But a woman's love is waisted when she loves a running gun",Running Gun
Marty Robbins,"I was hangin' 'round town, just spendin' my time
Out of a job, not earnin' a dime
A feller steps up and he said, ""I suppose
You're a bronc fighter from looks of your clothes""
""you figures me right, I'm a good one"" I claim
""do you happen to have any bad ones to tame?""
Said ""he's got one, a bad one to buck
At throwin' good riders, he's had lots of luck""

I gets all het up and I ask what he pays
To ride this old nag for a couple of days
He offered me ten; I said, ""I'm your man
A bronc never lived that I couldn't span""
He said: ""get your saddle, I'll give you a chance""
In his buckboard we hopped and he drives to the ranch
I stayed 'til mornin' and right after chuck
I stepped out to see if this outlaw can buck

Down in the horse corral standin' alone
Is an old caballo, a strawberry roan
His legs are all spavined, he's got pigeon toes
Little pig eyes and a big roman nose
Little pin ears that touched at the tip
A big 44 brand was on his left hip
U-necked and old, with a long, lower jaw
I could see with one eye, he's a regular outlaw

I gets the blinds on 'im and it sure is a fright
Next comes the saddle and I screws it down tight
Then I steps on 'im and I raises the blinds
Get outta the way boys, he's gonna unwind
He sure is a frog-walker, he heaves a big sigh
He only lacks wings, for to be on the fly
He turns his old belly right up to the sun
He sure is a sun-fishin', son-of-a-gun

He's about the worst bucker I've seen on the range
He'll turn on a nickel and give you some change
He hits on all fours and goes up on high
Leaves me a spinnin' up there in the sky
I turns over twice and I comes back to earth
I lights in a cussin' the day of his birth
I know there are ponies that I cannot ride
There's some of them left, they haven't all died

I'll bet all my money, the man ain't alive
That'll stay with old strawberry
When he makes his high dive",The Strawberry Roan
