Michael Ball,"I'll sing it one last time for you
Then we really have to go
You've been the only thing that's right
In all I've done

And I can barely look at you
But every single time I do
I know we'll make it anywhere
Away from here

Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear

To think I might not see those eyes
Makes it so hard not to cry
And as we say our long goodbyes
I nearly do

Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear

Louder, louder
And we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak, I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say

Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear

Louder, louder
And we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak, I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say",Run
Michael Ballam,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Michael Ballam,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening
Michael Ballew,"I want you to want me;
I'm goin' crazy knowin' he will be your lover tonight.
And when he comes I'll let you go;
I'll just pretend as you walk out the door.
Oh no, I can't sleep;  oh no, I'm goin' crazy with love over you.
 
I need you to need me;
I wanna hold you but you're holdin' someone else in your arms.
When I close my eyes I see your face;
I'm just not sure how much my heart can erase.
Oh no, I can't think;  oh no, I'm goin' crazy with love over you.
 
Oh, honey, oh, sugar.
Oh no, I can't sleep anymore, baby.
Oh no, I can't think anymore, baby.",Oh No

Michael Bellar,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

Michael Bellar,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.",Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds
Michael Benedict,"Honey you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers go through rain
But how can love go through pain

Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-arity
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you baby til I don't want to see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger

Ain't that peculiar
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity

I cried so much just like a child that's lost its home
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears

Now ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity
Ain't it peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

Said I don't understand it baby
It's so strange sometimes",Ain't That Peculiar
Michael Berkowitz,"Don't the moon look lonesome shinin' thru the trees?
Don't the moon look lonesome shinin' thru the trees?
Don't your arms look lonesome when your baby back's up  to leave?
Well I'm goin' up on the mountain  to call that baby of mine 
Said I'm goin' up on the mountain  to call that baby of mine 

But something tells me he's not coming back this time

Would like to go to the country can't take you
I'm goin' up  to the country can't take you
Nothin' up there a man like you could do

He's got fins like a fish
Sheep  like a frog

When he loves me I hallo oh, hot dog
Love that man better than I do myself
But I'm all alone, all alone on the shelf, on the shelf",Boogie Blues
Michael Berkowitz,"When the porter yells Massachusetts
I'll be there with bells, Massachusetts
Homesick as can be, Massachusetts
Only place for me, Massachusetts
Got a special date
With that New England State

How my heart will knock, Massachusetts
To see Plymouth Rock, Massachusetts
Want to roam around, Massachusetts
In Nantucket town, Massachusetts
I can hardly wait
I hope the train ain't late

You can't guess how much it means for me to be there
Childhood friends and childhood scenes for me to see there

`Neath blue skies above, Massachusetts
With the one I love, Massachusetts
Just like Jack and Jill, Massachusetts
We'll climb Bunker Hill, Massachusetts
Spread the news around
I'm Massachusetts bound

As you walk to Lexington, you think of glory
When those minute men were done, they left a story

Where they speak with ee's, Massachusetts
Boston if you pleese, Massachusetts
Where they can't say can't, Massachusetts
And where Aunt meets Aunt, Massachusetts
Spread the news around
I'm Massachusetts, Massachusetts bound",Massachusetts
Michael Bloomfield,"Fare thee well, my own true love
Fare thee well a while,
For the ship is a-waiting and the wind blows free
And I am bound away for the sea,
Mary Ann.

If I had a flask of gin,
Whiskey there for two
And a great big bowl for to mix them in
I'd mix a drink for you my dear
Mary Ann.

The lobster boiling in the pot,
The bluefish on the hook;
The pain they bear is nothing like
The ache I bear for you, my dear
Mary Ann.

Fare thee well, my own true love
Fare thee well a while,
For though I go I'll surely come again
Though it be ten thousand miles, my dear
Mary Ann.

Fare thee well, my own true love
Fare thee well, my dear,
For the ship is a-waiting and the wind blows free
And I am bound away for the sea,
Mary Ann.

Michael Bloomfield,"I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun for another overload
I hear you singin' in the wire
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line

I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line",Blues Medley: Sweet Little Angel/Jelly Jelly

Can you see the tears roll down the street.

Can you see the tears roll down the street.
I've been looking for my baby
And I've been wondering where can she be

I my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street
I my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street
You know it hurt me, hurt me so bad
It made my poor heart skip a beat

I got a real, real fine feeling
That my baby she don't love me no more

That my baby she don't love me no more
You know the sky's been crying
Can see you see the tears roll down my door",The Sky Is Cryin'

You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no,

This might be our last goodbye

Carrie, Carrie, things they change my friend

You know at first you had me so confused

Just copin' with the feelings I so long refused

Well, I surrendered my love
I saw you turn your heart stone-cold to ice, darlin'
I put my heart on the line for you
Oh, I did, I put my heart on the line, yeah
First you take me to the highest ground
Then you keep me hanging like some foolish clown

I keep playing such a fools' game, yeah (forever)
I keep on playin', keep on playin' this fools' game
Yeah, this fools' game

I can't take another sleepless night
It's time to light the fire down inside of you
I don't mind: I have the sun on my back

To get a feeling that you never knew
You never knew
Got the secret in the palm of your hands
Will you keep it, woman?
Will you break this man?

It's such a fools' game, yeah
It's such a fools' game
I keep playing such a fools' game, yeah (forever)
I keep on playin', keep on playin' this fools' game

Overnight, overnight, oh, no, no

[Chorus]
Gave it all; for it seemed like ages
Lived the life of a rolling stone
Seen the world from a thousand stages
There ain't no feelin' you've ever known
Like when a hometown boy comes home

This guy's a joker, and this is not the key to your town
And there's always somebody who thinks he makes a living
From putting you down
You're aware of the odds just forgetting the chance you must take
When you're bound to a vision, there is no decision to make
No, no, no

[Chorus]

When he comes home
The road is long and you're on your own
But through it all you know your roots run so deep
Out on the rock-'n'-roll highway
You make a promise to bring it back home
And that's one promise you know ya gotta keep

But it's never gonna feel like
When a hometown boy comes home
He's a hometown hero",Hometown Hero
Michael Bolton,"You came to me and told me it was over
You assured me you wouldn't need him anymore
But that look upon your face is too familiar
It was long ago, but I've been there before

And this song is like a movie that we might as well pretend
From the moment as the camera closes in
Just say it one more time with feeling
One more time like you really mean it
The last time you told me you loved me
I almost believed you

If I'd never realized what I was asking for
I'd be confused upon the the presence of your pain
Though your smile cannot disguise the hurt within you
It appears upon the mention of his name

But most of all the strangest thing
It's hard for me to bear
That the words that should be music to my ears

Say it one more time with feeling
One more time like you really mean it
The last time you told me you loved me
I almost believed it

Sometimes I wish that you'd save that line for someone else
Do you want me to believe what you don't believe yourself
Well, let's not talk about it now
In my life I've made mistakes
This is just one chance I'll have to take

So let's carry on with the story
Try and shoot the scene again
As the moment that the camera closes in
Just say it one more time with feeling
One more time like you really mean it
The last time you told me that you loved me

There's a fire in my heart that will burn till I find a way
Here inside we can feel what our words were not meant to say

To see myself loving someone new
Still I know I'm wasting my time

Bet it's all, it's only a lie

Who could hurt me more
And when you promise me that no one else
Will ever take my place
I get the feeling you're just leading me on
And lying right to my face

First you say you want me then you say
You're leaving
I've gotta know if I'm coming or going with you
When ya say you need me
Do you really mean it
Maybe it's true I just wish I could believe it

Hot love ya leave me so cold
But one touch and you've got me
Where ya want me
Hot love ya leave me so cold
I don't know if I'm coming or going
There's no way of knowing with you

Just when I give it up the game
Is through and your heart is mine
I turn around you're up to something new
Ya do it time after time

What's it gonna take to break this circle
I've gotta know am I coming or going with you
And when ya hurt me do ya really mean to
Ya say ya don't I wish I could believe you

Hot love ya leave me so cold
But one touch and you've got me
Where ya want me
Hot love ya leave me so cold
I don't know if I'm coming or going
There's no way of knowing with you

You come on like a fire burning
And I'm lost in the flame
Over and over again

Hot love ya leave me so cold
But one touch and you've got me
Where ya want me
Hot love ya leave me so cold
I don't know if I'm coming or going
There's no way of knowing with you

Michael Bolton,"Shadows fall
Through the darkness we reach
As the hunger calls
Then you run
To the passion that takes you over

No lookin' back
The chance will never come again
You risk it all
For your dream
Won't let you go

When you feel the hunger
Drivin' you on
To your one desire
Alone through an endless night
And the need's never satisfied

Through these eyes
Seen a river of tears
Seen the strong survive
Separate lives
And the emptiness makes you wonder
Blame it on love

You had it all and it's not enough
You'll never change
A slave to the fire
It never ends

Still you've got the hunger
Drivin' you on
To your one desire
Never deny your heart

The need to be satisfied
Still you feel the hunger
The primitive right
Of a restless breed
Surrendering all your life
To the true nature of the beast

No looking back
The chance will never come again
You give it all to your dream
It never ends",The Hunger

We thought our dream was over
When you and I
Had surely reached the end
Still here we are
The flame as strong as ever
All because we both kept holding on
We know we can weather any storm
Baby, that's what love is all about
Two hearts that find a way, somehow
To keep the fire burning
It's something we could never live without
It it takes forever
We can work it out
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
Baby, that's what love is all about
As time goes by
We've learned to rediscover
The reason why
This dream of our survives
Through thick and thin
We're destined for each other
Knowing we can reach the other side
Far beyond the mountains of our pride
Ridin' the good times is easy
The hard times can tear you apart
There'll be times in your heart
When the feelin' is gone
But ya keep on believing
And ya keep holdin' on

And it nearly drove me out of my mind
Always thinking what she meant to me
All we left behind
Can't be afraid, startin' over
When you're drownin' in your loneliness
The hurtin' never ends
And the night rolls on 
I search for some peace of mind
No, I can't be wrong
Won't get burned by desire this time
 
Gonna wait on love
Holdin' out till I find the one
Wait on love, won't hold back
I promised myself, till it comes
Gonna wait on love
 
Wanna get close with somebody
When a voice says I'm movin' too fast
It's hard to know when to walk away
Or try to make it last
Still the night rolls on 
Secrets are safe in the dark
And I stayed too long
I'm not gonna lie to my heart
 
Gonna wait on love
Holdin' out till I find the one
Wait on love, won't hold back
I promised myself, till it comes
Gonna wait on love
 
Someone I can run to
Just know that it's right
Trust my heart and soul to

Michael Bolton,"What do you do when you know something's bad for you
And you still can't let go?

I was naive
Your love was like candy
Artificially sweet
I was deceived by the wrapping

Got caught in your web
And I learned how to bleed
I was prey in your bed
And devoured completely

And it hurts my soul
Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
'Cause I, I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

I should have known
I was used for amusement
Couldn't see through the smoke
It was all an illusion

Now I've been licking my wounds (licking my wounds)
But the venom seeps deeper(deeper, deeper)
We both can seduce
But darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)

I'm about to break
I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
And I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need

I can't mend
This torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya

Every time I try to grasp for air
I get smothered in despair, it's never over, over
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,
I let out a silent prayer
Let it be over, over

Inside I'm screaming
Begging, pleading
No more

I don't know what to do
My heart has been bruised
So sad but it's true
Each beat reminds me of you

It hurts my soul
'Cause I can't let go

And how we promised together
Forever that we'd never fall

Deep in our restless hearts

Nothing breaks the ties

The air that I can breathe

And always let me know
Found the strength to understand
It's been no easy road

You've never given up
Can't live without your love

Until you believe

You're all that I need

You always said I'd never know how much I loved you
Until it was too late to make you stay
I know it looked as though I took our love for granted
That doesn't mean I wasn't feeling all the things
I meant to say


( Suzie )
And who was I always asking so much of you
To make you prove your love time after time
Until I found myself living my life without you
How could I have been so foolish, how could
I be so blind

From now on I'm gonna love you like there's no tomorrow
I don't want to wait until our time has come and gone
I'm gonna hold you now more than ever

Till I see your face
Chase away this loneliness inside

When you're close to my heart
Right here in my arms
Then and only then
Will I be satisfied
I'm missing you now
We'll be together, it won't be long, it won't be long
But it feels like forever, and it's hard to be strong

[Chorus]",Missing You Now
Michael Bolton,"There's always somethin' new about you
Always somethin' takes me by complete surprise
Every time I see you, I see a part of you
Oh, I've never seen before

Every day and night, the more we know each other
Every single time, the more that I discover

[Chorus]
It's a new love, always feels like a new love
Every touch is feelin' so much
Like the very first touch
Like a new love, always feels like a new love
It's never old whenever we make love
And I can't get enough of this new love

I'm still excited just talkin' to you
I'm still inspired just walkin' next to you
Girl, the way I need you
I find as time goes by, oh I need you even more

Nothin' feels as good, as good as us together
Nothin' in the world, no; there ain't nothin' better than this

[Chorus]

We can just go on and on
'Long as we keep this love
'Long as we keep this love

[Chorus]",New Love
Michael Bolton,"I can still remember
When all I had was time
A time when I had nothin'
But this empty heart of mine

When I needed inspiration
When the night was all I knew
You were the light shinin' into my life
The reason for all the love I'm feelin'

[Chorus]
Now that I've found you
I don't know how I lived without you
I don't know how I survived without your love
Now that I've found you
I only know I'd be lost without you
I found the love
That I'll never find again
'Cause all I ever needed
And all I ever wanted
Has come true
I found it all now that I've found you

I could've searched forever
And never realized
The treasure of a lifetime
Was the love inside your eyes
When I reach for inspiration
In your touch, it's always there
Givin' me faith every step of the way
Givin' me all I ever needed

[Chorus]

And every step of the way
Gonna dedicate my heart to you
Promise you my world forever
Pledgin' my love my whole life through",Now That I Found You
Michael Bolton,"Tonight I feel like a prisoner
On fire, waiting desperately
Denied, sentenced forever more
Only your love can set me free

I search my heart in vain
To understand what I'm supposed to do
Ain't never felt this way
But there was never anyone like you

[Chorus]
Lover, you've gotta save me
Oh, woman, don't you drive me crazy
Lover, you've gotta save me
Believe me, you're the one
Won't you come and save me?

Inside, so deep in the heart of me
You've got this power I just can't explain
In this life, this world of insanity
I'm at your mercy when you call my name

Something in your touch defies all reason
With you passion rules
I never felt this much
But there was never anyone like you

[Chorus]

Take me through this fire, this raging wall of flames
Only you can break me from these chains

[Chorus]

Save me",Save Me
Michael Bolton,"In the night I hear you speak
Turn around, you're in my sleep
Feel your hands inside my soul
You're holding on and you won't let go

I've tried running, but there's no escape
Can't bend them, and I just can't break these

[Chorus]
Steel bars, wrapped all around me
I've been your prisoner since the day you found me
I'm bound forever till the end of time
Steel bars wrapped around this heart of mine

Trying hard to recognize
See the face behind the eyes
Feel your haunting ways like chains
'Round my heart they still remain

[Chorus]

And with every step I take
Every desperate move I make
It's clear to me
What can all my living mean
When time itself is so obscene
When time itself don't mean a thing?
I'm still loving you

[Chorus]",Steel Bars
Michael Bolton,"So you say that you can't go on
Love left you cryin'
And you say all your hope is gone
And what's the use in tryin'?
What you need is to have some faith
Shake off those sad blues
Get yourself a new view

Oh, nothing is as sad as it seems, you know
'Cause someday you'll laugh at the heartache
Someday you'll laugh at the pain
Somehow you'll get through the heartache
Somehow you can get through the rain

[Chorus]
When love puts you through the fire
When love puts you through the test
Nothing cures a broken heart
Like time, love, and tenderness
When you think your world is over
Baby, just remember this
Nothing heals a broken heart
Like time, love, and tenderness
Time, love, and tenderness

I understand how you're feeling now
And what you've been through
But your world's gonna turn around
So, baby, don't you be blue
All it takes is a little time
To make it better
The hurt won't last forever

Oh, all the tears are gonna dry you know
'Cause someday you'll laugh at the heartache
Someday you'll laugh at the pain
You may be down on your luck
But, baby, that old luck's gonna change

[Chorus]

Baby, oh baby you just need some
You just need some
Time, love, and tenderness
Time, love, and tenderness
The hurt ain't gonna last forever
Time, love, and tenderness
Time, love, and tenderness","Time, Love and Tenderness"
Michael Bolton,"Here we are, just going through the motions one more time
You look into my eyes but you don't see me
And here I am, feeling like a stranger in your arms
I touch you, I hold you but lately I don't know you

Something is wrong but we go on from day to day
And we just pretend it all away
We act like nothing's changed
But in our hearts we know, it's not the same, oh, no

'Cause we're not makin' love anymore
Baby, we're not makin' love like before
We may hold each other tight
Say that everything's alright
But we're not makin' love

Remember when you couldn't wait to run into my arms
When the love inside my heart was all you needed
Remember when you made me wish the night would never end
The fire, the thunder, we lived to love each other

If ever two hearts were one, then it was yours and mine
But that was another place in time
Now all we have to show
Are memories of a dream we used to know

'Cause we're not makin' love anymore
Baby, we're not makin' love like before
We may hold each other tight
Say that everything's alright
But we're not makin' love

When did we lose our way? We had it all
Don't know how it all just slipped away
But oh, can we get it back again?
Is it too late? Can we try just one time?

'Cause darling, we're not makin' love anymore
Baby, we're not makin' love like before
We may hold each other tight
Say that everything's alright

We're not makin' love anymore
Baby, we're not makin' love like before
Can we find a way to try?
Find the magic one more time
'Cause we're not makin' love
",We're Not Makin' Love Anymore
Michael Bolton,"When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd trade the world
For a good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend
If he puts her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be

When a man loves a woman
I give you everything I've got (yeah)
Trying to hold on
To your precious love
Baby please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playing him for a fool

I want to get lost in your rock-'n'-roll and drift away
Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul

You will always be, you will always be
The soul of my soul

Soul of my soul, heart of my heart
The greatest treasure of my life that's what you are
Soul of my soul, child of my heart
I love you more than you know, soul of my soul

Soul of my soul, heart of my heart
Some kind of miracle of my life that's what you are
Blood of my blood, light of my life
You mean much more than you know
Soul of my soul",Soul of My Soul
Michael Bolton,"Sometimes you find out what you wanted
Isn't really what you need
And the dream and all its promise
Was never meant to be
All your hopes and desperation
Won't make it like it was
And you believe the pain will never end
Believe me in time it does

[Chorus]
You've gotta know when love is over
You've gotta learn to carry on
And with the world upon your shoulders
You walk away when hope is gone
When your golden road has reached the end
You find a way to start again, you know
There's a time for love, a time for letting go

When you're standin' tall tomorrow
Looking back at yesterday
Through the memory of your sorrow
How the dawn was so far away
You'll be far beyond the shadow
Where hearts can learn to shine
And you'll realize the endless night
Was only a moment in time

[Chorus]

The night is long, the night is cold
With nothing to believe in
Just hold on 'cause life goes on
Your new day is waiting
Let go and let it begin

[Chorus]",A Time for Letting Go
Michael Bolton,"Gotta get close to me
Gotta let love inside
Gotta get into my arms
And listen to the voice of my heart
Oh, oh, oh

Searchin' my soul, searchin' for somethin'
To find a way to make you believe, yeah
And what can I say? Words don't mean nothin'
Oh, what can I do to prove what I'm feelin' for you?

Oh, I could promise you love eternally
Swear you mean the world to me
Tell you over and over, get down on my knees
To hold you and make you believe

[Chorus]
Gotta get close to me, gotta let love inside
Gotta get into my arms and listen to the voice of my heart
Baby, the only way you'll know the sound inside my soul
Gotta get close to me and listen to the voice of my heart

Look into my eyes; don't look behind you
Let me take you where heaven is waiting
Right here in my arms, yeah
I promise this time real love will find you
Oh, what can I do to just make this one thing come true?

Oh, I would take your heart into my hands
Shelter you, make you understand
Tell you over and over you're all that I need
To hold you and make you believe

[Chorus]

Talkin' 'bout some deep emotion
You'll find it when you look in my eyes
Lookin' for some real emotion
Come into my life, come into my arms
Come closer, come closer
It don't mean a thing until I can make you believe

Gotta let love inside
Gotta get into my arms)

What else can I do, I'm forever wantin' you

I can see it comin', hey
'Cause heaven sent you down to me

I saw your wings unveil, inviting to me

Like some cruel game we can't seem to win
It just goes on over and over again

It took the best outta you and me

Am I wrong
Didn't we part as friends

How many lifetimes must we live through
'Til we're lookin' through the eyes of the truth

We are joined at the soul
With a heart that don't know how to let go

When we say good-bye
But if life is unkind
And forever ain't a place we can find
We'll know how we've tried
And that forever's just a matter of time

So much love, so much pain
No one to judge, no one to blame
It holds on
How desperate this need that remains

We know the passion that leads us blind
'Cause the two of us are one of a kind

We are joined at the soul
With a heart that don't know how to let go
What does it mean when it don't mean a thing

And forever ain't a place we can find
We'll know how we've tried
And that forever's just a matter of time

Time after time we stumble and fall
Past the point of no return
God knows we've given so much more than our all
To this lesson we may never learn

We are joined at the soul
With a heart that don't know how to let go
What does it mean when it don't mean a thing

And that forever's just a matter of time",Forever's Just a Matter of Time
Michael Bolton,"We've got the power, we've got the hunger for the search
As we race across the heavens to embrace the universe
In this hour and in truth what is it worth
When we can't escape the madness
We've created on this earth

They say that money talks but you and I
Know places money just don't say enough

Let there be love where there is emptiness
Let there be faith where hope is gone
Let there be strength where there is helplessness
And open eyes to see right from wrong
We've gotta find a way to trust
The very best in all of us
Let there be love, let there be love

We live divided behind imaginary walls
Brother against brother, we just watch each other fall
With hearts united we will never stand so tall
Reachin' out to one another
We'll find the meaning of it all

Ain't one power we will ever know
Could ever heal the poverty of the soul

Let there be love where there is emptiness
Let there be faith where hope is gone
Let there be strength where there is helplessness
And open eyes to see right from wrong
We've gotta find a way to trust
To forgive and rise above
Let there be love, let there be love

(When will we learn, tell me when will we see)
How many more promises spoken
While the dreams of the innocent die
Every day another heart gets broken
While the flame of hate survives
When will the healing begin in our lives

Let there be love where there is emptiness
Let there be faith where hope is gone
Let there be strength where there is helplessness
And open eyes to see right from wrong
We've gotta find a way to trust
The very best in all of us
Gotta be more than wise enough

Pleasure or pain

Am I in it for the pleasure or pain

Ya make me smile
Make me thankful that I breathe

Before ya drop me to my knees
Ya chain me baby, till it's time to set me free

Michael Bolton,"I have often dreamed of a far off place
Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me
Where the crowds would cheer, when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be

I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
I will find my way if I can be strong
I know every mile would be worth my while
When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong

Down an unknown road to embrace my fate
Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years would be worth the wait
It might take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through

And I won't look back, I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope
But I won't loose hope, 'till I go the distance
And my journey is complete, oh yeah

But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart, oh

Like a shooting star, I will go the distance
I will search the world, I will face its harms
I don't care how far, I can go the distance

Tu pure, o Principessa

Guardi le stelle che tremano d'amore
E di speranza!
Ma il mio mistero e chiuso in me
No, no, sulla tua bocca lo dirò
Quando la luce splenderà!

Michael Bolton,"Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People called said, ?Beware doll, you're bound to fall?
But you thought they were all just kidding you

You used to laugh about everybody that was hanging out
And now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal

How does it feel? How does it feel?
To be on your own, with no direction home
Like a complete unknown, just like a rolling stone

Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they did their tricks for you
You never understood it ain't no good
Shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you, oh

You used to ride on a chrome horse with a diplomat
Carried on his shoulder, siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discovered that he really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal

How does it feel? How does it feel?
To be on your own, with no direction home
Like a complete unknown, just like a rolling stone

Princess on the steeple, all the pretty people
Drinking, thinking that they've got it made
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things
Better lift your diamond ring, you better pawn it babe

You used to be so amused
Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to loose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal

How does it feel? How does it feel?
To be on your own and no direction home
Like a complete unknown, just like a rolling stone

Just like a rolling stone

We skipped the light fandango
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kind of seasick
But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well've been closed

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

And so it was.... (fade)

Michael Bolton,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Though I wasn't ready to believe you were there to reach inside of me.
I thank you for the love you gave
For every step along the way
You taught me to believe again
Baby, that´s the hardest part.
It´s all because you took the journey
The journey to the center of my heart

Looking back I have to laugh
Thinking how I walked the earth so proudly on my own
When deep down I was scared to be alone
Somewhere down that lonely path
You appeared with love to follow anywhere I go
How did you know that you could turn my world around
This place I never would have found
Without you I would spend my life afraid to fly

She was standing there
By the bar in a red dress
I couldn't catch my breath

I couldn't fight it
I felt my knees go weak

I admit it: she's a little too hot for me
I don't really want to walk through the fire

Led me down the stairs
To the floor where the music was
Worshiped by strangers
Her body moved in ways I've never seen
Has the face of an angel
So filled with danger
I couldn't fight it
I couldn't take the heat
She barely had to speak

I don't really want to fall tonight
But it feels so right
When I know it's so wrong
I don't really want to walk away
But she's beggin' me to stay
And she's much too strong

I wanna love with my eyes closed, yeah
I want your warm body next to me
So I can feel what my heart knows

Wanna love with my eyes closed
Wanna live in the afterglow
Wanna trust then I can believe
Everything that my heart knows
Wanna love with my eyes closed

I've seen beauty in the mountains
I've seen rivers meet the sea
I've seen light above the horizon
Shining down all over me
I've seen beggars turn to rich men
Seen the birth of my own child

I don't wanna find this feeling
Just to let it go

Wanna love with my eyes closed",Love With My Eyes Closed
Michael Bolton,"It's beautiful, your honesty
You cry when you need to
You say what you feel
You're never afraid to wear your heart on your sleeve
You're always so open with me

It's in your voice, I can hear it
The sound of a woman in love

[Chorus]
Only a woman can love you so much
Give you her life and give you her trust
Not any woman can do what you do
Only a woman like you

It's magical, your love for me
It's more than a man could ever receive
I'm just a man and it's hard to believe
A woman like you could love me

It's in your eyes, I can see it
The look of a woman in love

[Chorus]

If only I could find the words to say
But I just can't, so forgive me
'Cause you took the words away
You answered every prayer I always prayed

It's in your touch, I can feel it
The feeling of a woman in love

[Chorus: x2]",Only a Woman Like You
Michael Bolton,"I simply love you, I don´t have to ask why
I simply know this, like the sun knows to shine
The way you touch me, is there anything so right
In the soul of every part of me, I feel alive

[CHORUS:] 
It´s true, I don´t have to think twice
So true, baby, you´re the fact of life
Every little thing you say and do 
Just breaks me down and brings me back to you
It´s true, there ain´t no doubt in my heart
It´s you, even in the deepest part 
Never gonna be a way around it 
It all comes down to...

I simply need you and I want you ´till I ache
You made me need you
The choice was never mine to make
I surrender, I´m just a man with no escape
´cause I´m really not about to live without you, baby

Ain´t got no temptation, try to solve this mystery
There ain´t no explanation, just need to find out what´s meant to be

Slowly I feel my soul consumed
I´m losing myself in you...

Piece by piece, baby, I come undone, slowly...

To go on and on and on, oh baby

This is the way that we live
This is the world where our dreams survive
Fight for the love that we give
The love that we make is all in the way that we live
The way that we live

In my dreams I can fly
In your arms, there's no earth, no sky
There's one truth, no lies
There's no distance between us

Hold on 'till forever is gone
Hold on to whatever it takes to go on and on, oh baby

In our lives there's so much useless information
The truth is as simple as the air that we breathe
So many souls with the need for human affirmation
You and I choose to believe we are free!

This is the world where our dreams survive
Fight for the love that we give

Michael Bolton,"I know I´m old 'til the moment when we dance
I finally realize I'm not so strong
Until my heart have had enough
So I close the door round up
But baby you prove me wrong

Now I remember what it´s like to hurt so deep inside
God I never want to know 'til you brought me back to life
Been forever since I love somebody till I cry because of you
Because of you
I can feel again
I can feel again

My heart was going through the motion of beating
But I was faking everything breath I take
You taught me with the single kiss
Simple truth I almost miss
What good to heart that can´t break

Now I remember what it´s like to hurt so deep inside
God I never want to know 'til you brought me back to life
Been forever since I love somebody till I cry because of you
Because of you
I can feel again
Feel my life begin
Put an end to all this emptiness and let you in
Took me all enough and now that I know
Never got this feeling
Oh baby

Now I remember what it´s like to hurt so deep inside
God I never want to know 'til you brought me back to life
Been forever since I love somebody till I cry because of you
Cause of you
Baby every way you touch me makes my senses speak
Now I dream in eleven colors
Since you woke me from my sleep
More you give, the more I wonder
Where the hell I've been

Because of you
Because of you
I can feel again
I can feel again
I can feel",To Feel Again
Michael Bolton,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)
Always
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)
Always
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)
Always
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)
Always mm mm

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As [From the Motion Picture Snow Dogs]
Michael Bolton,"Tell me something I could say
To make you feel the power
Of my love for you
Just help me find the way

If I thought you didn't know
Just how sweet you really made it
Music to my soul...

[Chorus:]
Far beyond all space and time
You'll live within this heart of mine
And forever with you
I will be
Take my heart and take my hand
I'll love you with all I am
When forever's through
I'll be loving you
Eternally...

Within my dreams I knew you'd come
I knew you long before I ever saw your face
You are the only one
And no one in this world could ever take your place
Oh, for as long as I am breathing
Till the stars fall from the sky
You're the one thing I believe in
My every reason why...

I'll love you all my life

Michael Bolton,"You and I sailed away to a place
We once called paradise
We were young and deep in our love
And we never needed lies
So here we stand face to face
Knowing we've drifted apart
As for myself, there'll be nobody else
Who'll ever touch this place in my heart
You just call my name
And I'll come runnin' for you in the night
Just call my name
And I'll come runnin' right back into your life
If you ever need my love, call my name
Will ya call the love we shared
Just a moment passing in time
It was a moment I can never forget
And a love that was so hard to find
There are no chains to hold you down
I told you a long time ago
If the time has come for movin' on
There's one thing I need you to know
You just call my name
And I'll come runnin' for you in the night
Just call my name
And I'll come runnin' right back into your life
If you ever need my love, call my name
If you feel you need my love
And it's time we start over again
You just call my name
And I'll come runnin' for you in the night
Just call my name
And I'll come runnin' right back into your life
If you ever need my love, call my name
",Call My Name
Michael Bolton,"Here you come with that song on your face
Telling me with tears in your eyes
How you made a big mistake
Now you say you realize
Was I just supposed to fade away
Into the lonely night?

Just waitin' for the day
You would say you've learned your lesson well
Livin' without my love was hell
And I would believe every word that you say
But I know when I just look in your eyes

[Chorus]
You don't want me bad enough
You don't want me bad enough right now
I don't think you've had enough
Baby, you don't want me bad enough right now

Maybe you could take some time
Think about the plans we once made
Before you put your dreams on the line
Think about the price to be paid
Was I supposed to open up the door
And carry on just like it was before?

I hope you understand it's not the end
But I'm not goin' through this scene again
And I do believe every word that you say
But I know when I just look in your eyes

[Chorus]

Love you'll learn is a double-edged blade
Now the tables are turned
And it cuts both ways
If you're ready for love
Then I want you to stay

This time, I've gotta be sure, yeah

But what does it bring
If I ain't got you, I ain't got you

Like your words that once rang true
Just like the love I thought I found in you

But you walked away when I needed you most

Now maybe, baby, maybe, baby, I found someone
To take away the heartache, to take away the loneliness
I've been feelin' since you've been gone, since you've been gone

Dry your eyes. I never could bear to see you cry
Someday your love will shine through
And show you the feelings you never really knew
But, baby, don't ya lose that thunder, talkin' 'bout the fire in your eyes
You're lookin' at me but you still don't believe

That maybe, baby, maybe, baby, I found someone
To take away the heartache, to take away the loneliness
I've been feelin' since you've been gone, since you've been gone

Too long on the border line, wonderin' if your love was really mine
But you left me with open eyes, and when I realized, baby

And then you say goodbye

How can mere words my heart explain

Watchin' the tide roll away
Sittin' on the dock of the bay

I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll just remain the same

Nobody could have ever known
The road that lay before you
The journey that would lead you home
How steep was the mountain
How long was the fight
In the face of something so wrong
Somebody had to make it right

The courage in your eyes
The wisdom in your smile
The strength within your heart
To walk the endless mile
The years have only shined upon your face
And showered you with dignity and grace
Like the way you live your life
And the light you've always shown
More than the world, more than the world
Has ever known

Through the night and the darkest hours
The promise and the faith you kept
Brought the fury and the danger
To your home where your children slept
You believed in a time for love
There'd never be a time for hate
What kind of woman keeps the dream alive
What kind of dream does a lifetime take

Michael Bolton,"I have often dreamed of a far off place
Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me
Where the crowds would cheer, when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be 

I'll be there someday; I can go the distance
I will find my way if I can be strong
I know every mile would be worth my while
When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong

Down an unknown road to embrace my fate
Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years would be worth the wait
It might take a lifetime, but somehow I'll see it through 

And I won't look back; I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track; no, I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope
But I won't loose hope till I go the distance 
And my journey is complete, oh yeah

But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart, oh

Like a shooting star, I will go the distance
I will search the world; I will face its harms
I don't care how far; I can go the distance
Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms

Michael Bolton,"(Turandot)(No one's sleeping!)
Nessun Dorma! Nessun Dorma!
Tu pure, o Principessa,
nella tua freda stanza
guardi le stelle che tremano d'amore
e di speranza!
Ma il mio mistero e chiusoin me,
No, no, sulla tua bocca lo diro
quando la luce splendera!
Ed il mio bacio sciogliera il silenzio
che ti fa mia!
Dilegua, o notte! Tramontate, stelle!
Tramontate, stelle! All'alba vincero!

SYNOPSES
Only the man who answers her riddles can marry the icy
princess Turandot; those who fail die. Calaf, a prince from another land, has
fallen in love with the beautiful Turandot and answered the riddles. Though by
law she must marry him, Turandot pleads to be spared: only if she answers his
riddles-his name.
ENGLISH TRANSLATION
No one's sleeping! No one's sleeping!
This evening, icy princess
perhaps in your cold chambers,
watch all the bright stars
that tremble both with loving
and with desire
I keep my secret locked inside.
No one shall ever know my name!
No, no! When our two mouths
touch, she'll learn it,
when the morning light shines forth!
And then my kisses will dissolve
her silence and she will be mine!
May this night end! May all the stars set!
And may all the stars set!
When dawn breaks, I shall win!",Nessun Dorma [Live]
Michael Bolton,"Don't know why I never told you
There was something in your eyes that took my breath away
And every word I meant to say
Now I know I'd give my soul to you
Take you back in time and hold you
Just for one more day, so I wouldn't have to hurt this way
So I beg and plead, I'm on my knees
Gonna show you how long I can wait
I can't keep holding on if you're telling my heart it's too late

[Chorus]
Next lifetime our love will be deeper
And I'll hold you sweeter
I won't waste so much time
Next lifetime I'll find you sooner
And I'll kiss you better
I won't lose you next time
Oh I will lay my heart on the line, next lifetime

I don't know what I was thinking
But giving you a part of me wasn't good enough
Never gave you all my love
I can't believe I was such a fool
All I needed was to prove to you I could feel like this
Could have said it all in our last kiss
Oh I beg and plead, I'm on my knees
I could never unmake my mistake
I can keep holding on but if somebody's taking my place

[Chorus]

Never knew how long the nights could be
Till you slipped right through my hands
How do I make you believe that I deserve a second chance
Take me back to the place where your heart was mine
If I could take you back in time
I will lay my heart on the line [Repeat x2]",Next Lifetime

This love will never die forever we can have it all
And when I need to believe, I just look in your eyes
You're still the one, you're still the love of my life
Of my life, my life

We've had our ups and downs, we run against the wind
I built some mighty walls and watched your heart just climb right in
Some people thought we'd crumble but they were wrong, we survived
And makin' love to you still feels like the first time
Here with me, there ain't nobody but you

You're still the reason why the sky will never fall
This love will never die forever we can have it all
And when I need to believe, I just look in your eyes

Walk through the winds of change
But they just made us that much stronger
Even now when I watch you sleep
Can't believe you're here with me
You are the answer, the answer to the rest of my life

Michael Bolton,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

Michael Bolton,"The summer wind 
Came blowin' in from across the sea
It lingered there
To touch your hair and walk with me
All summer long we sang a song
Then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts and the summer wind

Like painted kites
Those days and nights they went flyin' by
The world was new 
Beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than a piper man
One day it called to you
I lost you
I lost you to the summer wind

The autumn wind and the winter winds
They have come and gone
And still the days
Those lonely days they go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies
Through nights that never end
My fickle friend, the summer wind

Warm summer wind",Summer Wind

Like the kicker in a julep or two

That you might give a thought to my plea
Cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself, get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature rise

Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

The lights are turned way down low

How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight

Here to stay
Is a new bird

As we stroll along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say ""Are you married?""; we'll say ""No, man
But you can do the job when you're in town.""

Only you remind me to breathe
When my life becomes invisible
You're the only light I need
Baby you comfort me

The faces change when time is on your side
The hand you trust can suddenly become a (?) of lies
The winds of war can leave no place to hide oh no
Until I hear a voice that calls
Lifts me up and carries me away

Baby you comfort me
Only you remind me to breathe
When my life makes me a prison
It's your love that sets me free
Baby you comfort me

My shelter from the rage of the storm (rage of the storm)
You take me to the place in time where my soul lifted
Safe and warm
Until I hear a voice that calls
Lifts me up and carries me away

Baby you comfort me
Only you can make me believe
When truth becomes invisible
You're the only light I need
When my life makes me a prison
It's your love that sets me free
Baby you, only you
Baby you, you comfort me
Oh yeah",You Comfort Me

Among the fields of barley
In his arms she fell as her hair came down
Among the fields of gold

Will you stay with me? Will you be my love?
Among the fields of barley
And you can tell the sun in his jealous sky

We will walk in fields of gold

Michael Bolton,"I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Baby I have been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you.
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in with you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there’s a God above
But all I’ve ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
It’s not a cry you can hear at night
It’s not somebody who has seen the light
It’s a cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

Somethings missing, from seven years ago
You tell me baby don't you cry anymore

I am shaking
Not a breath left to breathe
All this sadness so cold

I'll never be ready

Waiting at the door
Its hard to imagine

I'm scared of tomorrow
And the emptiness to come

Look me in the eyes,
You know it's okay we didn't make it forever
Come hold my hand,
Hold on to this last minute we have together

I could hold you for a million years

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong.

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawlin' down the avenue
No, there's nothin' that I wouldn't do

And on the highway of regrets
Though winds of change are throwing wild and free

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops

Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't 
disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so

So many nights like this

And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

Michael Brecker,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love [*]

Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings

She looks fine tonight

I'll lose my head, tonight

I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well, I'm all grown-up now
Can you still help somehow?
I'm not a child, but my heart still can dream

So here's my lifelong wish
My grown-up Christmas list
Not for myself, but for a world in need

No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
Every man would have a friend
That right would always win
And love would never end
This is my grown-up Christmas list

What is this illusion called the innocence of youth?
Maybe only in that blind belief can we ever find the truth

No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal our hearts
Every man would have a friend
That right would always win
And love would never end

In lama land, there's a one man band
And he'll toot his flute for you

Where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide

Once I get you up there
I'll be holding you so near

Michael Bublé,"Never know how much I love you, never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me, I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever - when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight
Fever - in the the morning, fever all through the night.

Sun lights up the daytime, moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name, and you know I'm gonna treat you right
You give me fever - when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight
Fever - in the the morning, fever all through the night.

Everybody's got the fever, that is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing, fever started long ago.
Romeo loved Juliet, Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her, he said ""Julie baby you're my flame""

Thou givest fever, when we kisseth, fever with thy flaming youth
Fever - I'm afire, fever yea I burn forsooth.
Captain Smith and Pocahontas had a very mad affair
When her Daddy tried to kill him, she said ""Daddy-O don't you dare""

Give me fever - with his kisses, fever when he holds me tight
Fever - I'm his Missus, Oh daddy won't you treat him right.

Now you've listened to my story, here's the point I have made:
Chicks were born to give you fever, be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
They give you fever - when you kiss them, fever if you live and learn
Fever - till you sizzle, what a lovely way to burn.
What a lovely way to burn.
What a lovely way to burn.",Fever

How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?

How can you mend a this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again

I can still feel the breeze
That rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow

You can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will

We should have seen love through

Fooled me with the tears in your eyes
Covered me with kisses and lies
So far
But please don’t take my heart

You are far
I’m never gonna be your star
I’ll pick up the pieces
To mend my heart
Strange that I was wrong enough
To think you’d love me too
You must have been kissing a fool
I said you must have been kissing a fool

But remember this
Every other kiss
That you’ll ever give
Long as we both live
When you need the hand of another man
One you really can surrender with
I will wait for you
Like I always do
There’s something there
That can’t compare with any other

You are far
When I could have been your star

It lingered there, so warm and fair - to walk with me
All summer long, we sang a song - and strolled on golden sand
Two sweethearts, and the summer wind

Like painted kites, those days and nights - went flyin' by
The world was new, beneath a blue - umbrella sky
Then softer than, a piper man - one day it called to you
And I lost you, to the summer wind

And still the days, those lonely days - go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies - through nights that never end

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Ev'rybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said 'Julie, baby, you're my flame
Thou giv-est fever when we kisseth
Fever with the flaming youth
Fever I'm afire
Fever yea I burn for sooth'
Captain Smith and Pocahantas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said 'Daddy, o, don't you dare
He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses,
Oh daddy, won't you treat him right'

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade
They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn",Fever [Live][*]
Michael Bublé,"I can only give you love that lasts forever, 
And a promise to be near each time you call. 
And the only heart I own 
For you and you alone

I can only give you country walks in springtime 
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall;
And a love whose burning light 
Will warm the winter's night 
That's all, 
That's all. 

There are those I am sure who have told you, 
They would give you the world for a toy. 
All I have are these arms to enfold you, 
And a love even time can't destroy. 

If you're wondering what I'm asking in return, dear, 
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small. 
Say it's me that you'll adore, 
For now and evermore

That's all.",That's All [Live][*]

But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

And I've brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And my dear we're still goodbye-ing
As long as you love me so

With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous night to make romance
'Neath the cover of October skies
And all the leaves on the trees are falling
To the sound of the breezes that blow
And I'm trying to please to the calling
Of your heart-strings that play soft and low
And all the night's magic seems to whisper and hush
And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush

Can I just have one a' more moondance with you, my love
Can I just make some more romance with a-you, my love

Well I want to make love to you tonight
I can't wait till the morning has come
And I know now the time is just right
And straight into my arms you will run
And when you come my heart will be waiting
To make sure you're never alone
There and then all my dreams will come true, dear
There and then I will make you my own
And everytime I touch you, you just tremble inside
And I know how much you want me that you can't hide

Can I just have one a' more moondance with you, my love
Can I just make some more romance with a-you, my love

Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous night to make romance

And all the leaves on the trees are falling
To the sound of the breezes that blow
And I'm trying to please to the calling
Of your heart-strings that play soft and low
And all the night's magic seems to whisper and hush
And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush

Can't I just have one more dance with you my love",Moondance [Album Version][Live]

Another time to contemplate and think
Will I ever, ever have anyone to love

It's not that I don't try
Maybe I try too hard
Seems like I'm living a lie
So there's a game I just won't learn

And I wonder will I always be alone
I take a sip and wonder
Why I haven't anyone to love

I guess I'll say goodnight

That you’ll ever give

And through foggy London Town

Of a true love withholding nothing,
You came out in front
When I was hiding,

Ooh but now its so much better
So if my words don't quite come together,
Listen to the melody
'Cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place
where there's no space or time,
I love you for my life

Remember when we were together
And we were alone now,

I watched the whole thing fall
And I never saw the writing that was on the wall
If I only knew
The days were slipping past
That the good things never last
That you were crying

Summer turned to winter
And the snow, it turned to rain
And the rain turned into tears upon your face
I hardly recognized the girl you are today

And God I hope it's not too late
It's not too late
Cause you are not alone
I'm always there with you

And we'll get lost together
Till the light comes pouring through
'Cause when you feel like you're done
And the darkness has won

Babe, you're not lost
When your world's crashing down
And you cannot bear the cross
I said, baby, you're not lost

Life can show no mercy
It can tear your soul apart
It can make you feel like you've gone crazy
But you're not

Things have seem to changed
There's one thing that's still the same
In my heart you have remained
And we can fly, fly, fly away

'Cause you are not alone
And I am there with you
And we'll get lost together
Til the light comes pouring through

'Cause when you feel like you're done
And the darkness has won
Babe, you're not lost

So hold on to me
Don't you ever let me go

There's a thousand ways for things to fall apart
But it's no one's fault
No it's not my fault

Maybe all the plans we made might not work out
But I have no doubt even though it's hard to see
I've got faith in us and I believe in you and me

So hold on to me tight
Hold on, I promise it'll be alright
'Cause it's you and me together
And baby all we've got is time
So hold on to me, hold on to me tonight

There's so many dreams that we have given up
Take a look at all we've got
And with this kind of love
What we've got here is enough

So hold on to me tight
Hold on, I promise it'll be alright
'Cause we are stronger here together
Then we could ever be alone
Just hold on to me
Don't you ever let me go
Hold on to me, it's gonna be alright
Hold on to me tonight
They always say we were the lucky ones",Hold On
Michael Bublé,"Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely nights dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
Oh, but that was long ago
And now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song

And beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You were in my arms
The nightingale tells it's fairy tale
Of paradise where roses grew

Though I dream in vain
In my heart it always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain

Though I dream in vain
In my heart it always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain",Stardust
Michael Bublé,"We've all been hurt by love
It's out of our hands
But for all it's worth
I'm drawing a line that's in the sand

Another morning just won't do
I need your love to shine on through
Or it won't be new

Whatever it takes, my love, I'll find it
Whatever it takes my love
To put the lonely days behind us
I'm laying it down
Whatever it takes my love

If there's a chance
For two hearts to celebrate
To blow out some candles
And tempt the hands of fate

You make a wish, I'll make one too
But close your eyes love when you do
Or it won't be true

Whatever it takes, my love, I'll find it
Whatever it takes my love
To put the lonely days behind us
I'm laying it down
Whatever it takes, my love

'Cause I've been wandering 'round
With the same old blues
That have been dragging me down
If you feel the same way too
Maybe it takes two

And if we give thanks
For our love at each new dawn
We'll find the strength
And the will to carry on

The sun alone will never do
Without your love to shine on through
It just won't be new

Whatever it takes, my love, I'll find it
Whatever it takes, my love
To put the lonely days behind us
I'm laying it down
Whatever it takes, my love
(Whatever it takes)

Oh, whatever it takes my love
To put the lonely days behind us
Whatever it takes my love, my love, my love
Whatever it takes
Whatever it takes my love
To put the lonely days behind us

Did you think I could hate you

How could I hurt you

How did I ever let my heart believe
In one who never gave enough to me
And so many years gone, love that was so wrong
I can't forget the way it used to be
And how you changed the taste of love for me

You were my one more chance
I never thought I'd find
You were the one romance
I've always known in my mind
No one will ever touch me more
And I only hope that in return
I might have saved the best of me for you

And we'll have no ending if we can hold on
And I think I've come this far because of you
Could be no other love but ours will do

You were my one more chance
I never thought I'd find
You were the one romance
I've always known in my mind
No one will ever touch me more
And I only hope that in return

Well remember when you're rich that you sold yourself for this
You'll be famous 'cause you're dead

So don't go higher for desire

I don't want to take you dancing
When you're dancing with the world
Well you can flash your caviar and your million dollar car

Or will you set the latest style
You don't need a catchy song
'Cause the kids will sing along

You can strut your little thing
You can swing from vine to vine
While the kiddies wait in line
With the money in their hands

But if you get to California
Save a piece of gold for me
If it's the only thing you'll save
Then I'll bet you'll never wave when I watch you on TV

A house that's filled with joy and laughter

Oh but this evening can be a holy night

And dim those Christmas lights

There's nothing else that you would need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under the tree want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night.

They call it the season of giving
I'm here, yours for the taking
They call it the season of giving I'm here I'm yours

Just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that we would need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under the tree want something that lasts forever
Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight
I'm wearin' our Christmas sweater
While talking to the mistletoe tonight
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night.

I'm here, yours for the taking

Michael Bublé,"It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",Mis Deseos/Feliz Navidad

In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, Are you married?
We'll say, No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kids knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way

Michael Bublé,"Way back when we started
There was a part of me that knew
One did every heartache and I would lose myself to you

And I walked all night
Watching the sun and city lights
Thinking of you
Wondering where I lose my mind

After all I'm delighted
To be back when we begin
I believe that you can fall in love with me again
And we'll both be standin' tall after all

I was all that you wanted

Lost in the sleepless empty nights
Dreamin' of you
And in those dreams you were mine

After all reunited
Yeah you're in my arms again

Cause our we're lovers and we're friends

Fall in love with you again

Every treasure on earth to be young at heart
For as rich as you are
It's much better by far to be young at heart

And here is the best part, you have a head start

The noise of what we often say is not worth being heard.
When the Father's wisdom wanted to communicate His love,
He spoke it in one final perfect Word.

He spoke the incarnation, and then so was born a Son.
His final word was Jesus, He needed no other one.
Spoke flesh and blood so He could bleed and make a way Divine.
And so was born a baby who would die to make it mine.

And so the Father's fondest thought became flesh and blood.
He spoke the living luminous word, at once His will was done.
And so the transformation that in man had been unheard,
Took place in God the Father as he spoke that final Word.

And so the Light became alive and manna became Man.
Eternity stepped into time so we could understand.",The Final Word

Hope for the hopeless and sight for the blind
To all who've been born of the Spirit

And who share incarnation with him;
Who belong to eternity, stranded in time,
And weary of struggling with sin.

That's before you,
And never stop counting the cost.
Remember the hopelessness when you were lost?",Joy in the Journey
Michael Card,"I thought that I heard crying coming through my door
Was it Rachel weeping for her sons who were no more
Could it have been the babies crying for themselves 
Never understanding that they died for someone else

Of innocent and helpless little babies 
Offerings to the spirit of the age

No way of understanding this sad and painful sign 
Whenever Satan rears his head, there comes a tragic time
If He could crush the cradle, then that would stop the cross 
He knew that once the Light was born, his every hope was lost

History speaks of it on every page

Offerings to the spirit of the age

Soon all the ones who seemed to die for nothing

And walked the earth in lowly majesty

Come to bare love's sacred mystery
He the Truth was called a liar
The only lover hated so

He was many times a martyr before He died
Forsaken by the Father
Despised by all the world
He alone was born to be the crucified

Upon the cross of Glory
His death was life to me
A sacrifice of love's most sacred mystery
And death rejoice to hold Him

And no words could ever say
And no cord is foul enough to sing the pain

And suffer with your song
You love us so and yet you bid us sing

Came down upon His head
It was not for anything He'd done
Or for anything He'd said
For all His life He'd sought to show
They were only living a lie
But they didn't care to hear, Oh no
They just wanted Him to die

Soon a circle of glory
Will be placed upon His brow
And He'll come to reign forever
Though it may not seem so now
Then our time of tears and trouble
Will seem only like a dream
As we stand before the glory
Of our Savior and our King

Michael Card,"Trembling with fear, alone in the garden
Battle before the final war
Blood became tears, there in the garden
To fall upon the silent stone
There in the darkness the Light
And the darkness stood still
Two choices, one tortured will
And there once the choice had been made
All the world could be saved by the One in the garden
The light of the dawn, was seen in the garden

By gentle eyes so sadly wise
The angels appear, they come to the garden
Clothed with sighs, they realize
The One they adored from the start
Will be broken apart
By the ones He had come to save
So they're here simply now to be near
He's no longer alone, they sit by him and moan",In the Garden

Feel the heat of the day, as you look down the way

Oh, daughter of Zion your time's drawing near
Don't forsake Him, oh don't pass it by
On the foal of a donkey as the prophets had said
Passing by you, He rides on to die
Come now little foal, though your not very old
Come and bear your first burden bravely
Walk so softly upon all the coats and the palms
Bare the One on your back oh so gently
Midst the shouting so loud and the joy of the crowd
There is One who is riding in silence
For He knows the ones here will be fleeing in fear
When their shepherd is taken away

Michael Card,"How did it feel to take the place
Of honor at the meal?
To take the sup from His own hand
A prophesy to seal?

Was it because He washed your feet
That you sold Him as a slave?
The Son of Man, the Lamb of God
Who'd only come to save

The silver that they paid to you
From out their precious till
Was meant to buy a spotless lamb
A sacrifice to kill

How heavy was the money bag
That couldn't set you free
It became a heavy millstone
As you fell into the sea

Now Judas, don't you come to close
I fear that I might see
That traitor's look upon your face
Might look too much like me

'Cause just like you I've sold the Lord
And often for much less
And like a wretched traitor
I betrayed Him with a kiss

",Traitor's Look
Michael Card,"Why did it have to be a friend
Who chose to betray the Lord
Why did he use a kiss to show them
That's not what a kiss is for

Only a friend can betray a friend
A stranger has nothing to gain
And only a friend comes close enough
To ever cause so much pain

And why did there have to be thorny
Crown pressed upon His head
It should have been the royal one
Made of jewels and gold instead

It had to be a crown of thorns
Because in this life that we live
For all who seek to love
A thorn is all the world has to give

And why did it have to be
A heavy cross He was made to bare
And why did they nail His feet and hands
His love would have held Him there

It was a cross for on a cross
A thief was supposed to pay
And Jesus had come into the world
To steal every heart away

Yes, Jesus had come into the world
To steal every heart away",Why

And claim Him as your Lord

Chorus
Don't you know that He loves you
Don't you know that He cares

So forget the game of being good,
And your self-righteous pain.
'Cause the only good inside your heart
Is the good that Jesus brings.
And when the world begins to see you change,
Don't expect them to applaud.
Just keep your eyes on Him and tell yourself,
I've become the work of God.
I have decided,
I'm gonna live like a believer,
Turn my back on the deceiver,
I'm gonna live what I believe.
I have decided,
Being good is just a fable,
I just can't 'cause I'm not able.
I'm gonna leave it to the Lord.
I have decided,
I'm gonna live like a believer,
Turn my back on the deceiver,

So how could I fear when trouble is near

Born older than the years
And in the stall the cross He saw
Through the first of many tears
A life of homeless wandering
Cast out in sorrow's way
The Shepherd seeking for the lost
His life the price He paid

Love crucified arose
The risen One in splendor
Jehovah's sole Defender
Has won the victory
Love crucified arose
And the grave became a place of hope

Throughout Your life You've felt the weight
Of what You'd come to give
To drink for us that crimson cup
So we might really live
At last the time love and die

Michael Card,"In the early morning mist
They saw a Stranger on the sea shore
He some how seemed familiar
Asking what the night had brought
With taught anticipation then
They listen to His order
And pulling in the net
Found more than they had ever caught
The one He loved first recognized
The stranger there was Jesus
And he alone remembered
This had happened once before
The one who had denied Him
Who had once walked on the water
Jumped in and swam to Him
To be confronted on the shore
Chorus
You need to be confronted
By the Stranger on the shore
You need to have Him search your soul
You need to hear the call
You need to learn exactly
What it means for you to follow
You need to realize that He's asking for your all
The meal He had prepared for them
Was waiting on the fire
The smell of bread
The sizzle of the fish upon the coals
The laughter and the joy
That once more being all together
They didn't realize that He was searching all their souls
Then came the painful questions
That would pierce the soul of Simon
A three fold chance to reaffirm the love he had denied
The gentle eyes that saw his heart
And waited for an answer
Had seen the look upon his face
The moment he had lied

Face and answer all His questions

Michael Card,"On a gray April morning as a chilling wind blew
A thousand dark promises were about to come true
As Satan stood trembling, knowing now he had lost
As the Lamb took his first step on the way to the cross
Chorus
This must be the Lamb
The fulfillment of all God had spoken
This must be the Lamb
Not a single bone will be broken
Like a sheep to the slaughter
So silently still
This must be the Lamb
They mocked his true calling and laughed at His fate
So glad to see the Gentle One consumed by their hate
Unaware of the wind and the darkening sky
So blind to the fact that it was God limping by

Trembling in fear there at the foot of the cross
Tormented by memories that came like a flood
Unaware that their pardon
Must be bought with His blood

Michael Card,"I am an old rabbi
Where's the Child who was here only yesterday
How my heart start to beat as I sat at His feet
For the things He'd say
The questions I asked Him
Had weighed on my mind an eternity
But the self-righteous show
I had made my disguise
It started to slip as I looked in His eyes
So rather than stay, for my pride sake
I walked away
Chorus
Come listen awhile to the voice of a Child
Stand in awe of the wisdom of God
Hear what He has to say
For the time is today
You can come or just walk away
Then late in the night I awoke to a voice
Deep inside of me
It was gentle and mild like the voice of a child
My mind's eye could see
It spoke of the promises
Made to my people through Abraham
And at once all the prophesy made sense to me
I'd studied them so long
Why couldn't I see
In one holy moment I knew the Messiah was He

The wounds of loves eternal war

With His own holy hands He sought
To touch and heal their scars

Michael Card,"Why did it have to be a friend
Who chose to betray the Lord
Why did he use a kiss to show them
That's not what a kiss is for

Only a friend can betray a friend
A stranger has nothing to gain
And only a friend comes close enough
To ever cause so much pain

And why did there have to be thorny
Crown pressed upon His head
It should have been the royal one
Made of jewels and gold instead

It had to be a crown of thorns
Because in this life that we live
For all who seek to love
A thorn is all the world has to give

And why did it have to be
A heavy cross He was made to bare
And why did they nail His feet and hands
His love would have held Him there

It was a cross for on a cross
A thief was supposed to pay
And Jesus had come into the world
To steal every heart away

Yes, Jesus had come into the world
To steal every heart away

I was not hopeless, though I'd been lost
Now, I felt I was found when He looked at me
With His forgiving eyes

The crowd gathered round, so angry and violent
But He stood beside me, peaceful and silent
Then with a word, with one question, He showed them
That they too were guilty and could not condemn

The next thing I knew, He asked me, ""Where are they?""
And I looked around the courtyard was empty
The stones scattered 'round, the warm morning sunlight
He'd made the darkness perfectly light

In this new light now I understood
He would not condemn me though He could
For He would be condemned someday for me

Their only choice, their only hope
Would he be heard
Their only way they might be saved
Would he be heard

And He offered up a living sacrifice
Now we His children wait for Him
With hope and joyful praise
For we know that God has heard Him
For we know that He was raised
He offered cheerful praise and He was heard
He offered up His life and He was heard

Destroyed the one who holds the power of death

My whole world would fall
I couldn't start anew
Girl I need your love like the plants need the rain
I couldn't stand a minute of this aching pain...
For a day...
For a time...
Until that special moment
When I know that you'll be mine
All I want...
All I need...
Is to feel your love and tenderness
While your arms are holding me
With God as my witness
I think that I'm falling...
In love with you..
I think that I'm falling...
In love with...
I think that I'm falling...

Michael Carpenter,"I love to see the cottonwood blossom
In the early spring
I love to see the message of love
That the bluebird brings

But when I see you walkin' with him
Down along the strand
I wish I were blind
When I see you with your man

I love to see your hair shining
In the long summer's light
I love to watch the stars fill the sky
On a summer night

The music plays you take his hand
I watch how you touch him as you start to dance
And I wish I were blind
When I see you with your man

We struggle here but all our love's in vain
And these eyes that once filled me with your beauty
Now fill me with pain
And the light that once entered here
Is banished from me

Like the kicker in a julep or two

That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

In my heart it will remain

The song that Crosby sings

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it

Michael Cleveland,"While we are living in this world of care
Many the burdens that we have to bear
But there's a prayer bell at the Lord's right hand
Give it a ring and He will understand

   Prayer bells of heaven oh how sweetly they ring
   Bearing a message unto Jesus our king
   When you are burdened down with sorrows and care
   Ring on and on for God will answer your prayer

Three Hebrew children to the fire were thrown
Because a worldly king they would not own
Jesus delivered and the king then saw
Prayer bells of heaven beat a man made law

When Paul and Silas were thrown into jail
They didn't worry who would go their bail
But on the prayer bells they began to ring
Off fell the stocks and they begin to sing

Into the garden Jesus went to pray
Until His sweat became as blood they say
Ringing the prayer bells there in agony
Bringing salvation that we might be free

Your head is humming and it won't go 
In case you don't know, 
The piper's calling you to join him, 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, 
And did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How ev'rything still turns to gold. 
And if you listen very hard 
The tune will come to you at last. 
When all are one and one is all 
To be a rock and not to roll. 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.",Stairway to Heaven

Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,

There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Birds fly over the rainbow. Why then, oh, why can't I?

Beyond the rainbow why, oh, why can't I?",Over the Rainbow

If there is a way
Take this cup away from me
For I don't want to taste its poison
Feel it burn me,
I have changed I'm not as sure
As when we started
Then I was inspired
Now I'm sad and tired
Listen surely I've exceeded
Expectations
Tried for three years
Seems like thirty
Could you ask as much
From any other man?

But if I die
See the saga through
And do the things you ask of me
Let them hate me, hit me, hurt me
Nail me to their tree
I'd want to know
I'd want to know my God
I'd want to know
I'd want to know my God
I'd want to see
I'd want to see my God
I'd want to see
I'd want to see my God
Why I should die
Would I be more noticed
Than I ever was before?
Would the things I've said and done
Matter any more?
I'd have to know
I'd have to know my Lord
I'd have to know
I'd have to know my Lord
I'd have to see

Why, why should I die?
Oh, why should I die?
Can you show me now
That I would not be killed in vain?
Show me just a little
Of your omnipresent brain
Show me there's a reason
For your wanting me to die
You're far too keen on where and how
But not so hot on why
Alright I'll die!
Just watch me die!
See how, see how I die!
Oh, just watch me die!

Michael Crawford,"Night time, sharpens, heightens each sensation,
Darkness stirs, and wakes imagination,
Silently the senses, abandon their defenses,

Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender,
Slowly, gently night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Turn you face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it, secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling, sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night",The Music of the Night
Michael Crawford,"Look at me, a woman, calm and in control
No silly girl, who's head's always turning
Nobody would guess that deep inside my soul

Only you have the power to move me
And together we'd make the whole world move in sympathy
And I couldn't see before

And only you have the power to move me
Take me, hold me, mold me, change me and improve me
It's not funny anymore, anymore

There was I, wondering why
Everyday disappeared into the distance
Now with you, the light is shining through
You gave me life, not just existence

Only you have the power to move me
And together we'd make the whole world move in sympathy
You have the power to move me

All the nights I've wasted, dreaming of the time
When I'd discovered the one to guide me
Searching the horizon, didn't realize
That all the time she was beside me

Only you have the power to move me
And together we'd make the whole world move in sympathy
Hope and pray that I'm in time, I'm in time

Only he can stand and wait that long
Stand by me while I was going wrong
What if she couldn't wait? Have I left it too late?

Only you have the power to move me
And together we'll make the whole world move in sympathy
Brighten up the darkest sky

If only you use the power to move me
Take me, hold me, mold me, change me and improve me
Only you have the power to move me

Somehow you would be here

Wishing I could hear your voice again
Knowing that I never would
Dreaming of you won't help me to do
All that you dreamed I could

Passing bells and sculpted angels
Cold and monumental
Seem for you the wrong companions
You were warm and gentle

Too many years fighting back tears
Why can't the past just die?

Wishing you were somehow here again

No more gazing across the wasted years

But the nights alone can be an eternity
That never heals the scars of foolish pride

Goodbye is not so easy, now
The freedom that I walked away to gain
Is nothing but these chains
That you alone can break

And you would free me, now
Your heart would come undone
Just looking at me once
And my love would bring you back
If only you could see me, now

Trying to fight the tears, missing by a mile
I'm not the one who laughed at you on that yesterday
When you warned me not to throw your love away

A chance to live each day 
And care the way you always knew you could

She plays with your emotions like a song
She chases dreams that can't come true
And always tries too hard for you
And never knows just how to say she's wrong

A chance to take these lonely days and make them sweet
A chance to feel so good 
That everyone will wish they could be you

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here

Michael Crawford,"Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor old self together
I'm weary all the time
Every time
So weary all of the time
When she went away
The blues walked in and then they met me
If she stays away
That old rocking chair's bound to get me
All I do is pray
The lord above will let me
Just walk in that sun again
Can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all of the time

Michael Crawford,"I'm a simple man, you know I don't have much of a plan
All the crazy things I put us through
Don't you stop and wonder, why me? Why you?

Well, you still make me laugh
Not as often maybe as in the past
Still enough for me to stand around
Don't you question, I don't question what I've found

With your hand upon my heart
You make me stronger than I thought I could be
When the world desires to tear us apart
I put my hand upon your heart

Sometimes we're forced to sail
In troubled waters, if the wind does prevail
Hmm, it?s not good enough, no, not good enough, you see
Oh, but it?s good enough for me

With your hand upon my heart
You make me stronger than I thought I could be
When the world desires to tear us apart
I put my hand upon your heart

And if we lose the light, well, do we have to see
For in perpetual night, I feel you here with me

I feel your hand upon my heart
I feel your hand, I feel you hand
You make me braver than I ever should be
You make me strong

And if the world would dare to tear us apart
You'll be right here, I feel your hand upon my heart
I feel, I feel your
I feel your hand upon my heart
",With Your Hand upon My Heart
Michael Crawford,"For all we know
We may never meet again
Before we go
Make this moment live again
We won't say goodbye
Until the last minute
I'll hold out my hand
And my heart will be in it

For all we know
This might only be a dream
We come and we go
Like the ripples, like the ripples in the stream
So baby, love me, love me tonight
Tomorrow was made for some
Oh, but tomorrow
But tomorrow may never, never come
For all we know
Yes, tomorrow may never, never come

Michael Crawford,"
Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you see me?
Papa can you find me in the night?
Papa are you near me?
Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you help me not be frightened?
Looking at the skies I seem to see
A million eyes which ones are yours?
Where are you now that yesterday
Has waved goodbye 
And closed its doors?
The night is so much darker;
The wind is so much colder;
The world I see is so much bigger
Now that I'm alone.
Papa, please forgive me.
Try to understand me;
Papa, don't you know I had no choice?
Can you hear me praying,
Anything I'm saying
Even though the night is filled with voices?
I remember everything you taught me
Every book 1've ever read...
Can all the words in all the books
Help me to face what lies ahead?
The trees are so much taller
And I feel so much smaller;
The moon is twice as lonely
And the stars are half as bright...
Papa, how I love you...
Papa, how I need you.
Papa, how I miss you
Kissing me good night...


","Papa, Can You Hear Me? [*]"
Michael Crawford,"Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
	That saved a wretch like me.
	I once was lost, but now am found,
	Was blind, but now I see.

	'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
	And grace my fears relieved.
	How precious did that grace appear
	The hour I first believed.

	Through many dangers, toils and snares
	I have already come;
	'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
	And grace will lead me home.

	The Lord has promised good to me
	His word my hope secures;
	He will my shield and portion be,
	As long as life endures.

	Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
	and mortal life shall cease,
	I shall possess within the veil,
	A life of joy and peace.

	When we've been there ten thousand years
	Bright shining as the sun,
	We've no less days to sing God's praise
	Than when we've first begun.

Michael Crawford,"Last night I lay a sleeping there came a dream so fair
I stood in old Jerusalem, beside the temple there
I heard the children singing and ever as they sang
I thought the voice of Angels from Heaven in answer rang
I thought the voice of Angels from Heaven in answer rang

Jerusalem, Jerusalem
Lift up your gates and sing
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna to your King

And once again the scene was changed, new earth there seemed to be
I saw the Holy City beside the tideless sea
The light of God was on its streets, the gates were open wide
And all who would might enter and no one was denied

No need of moon or stars by night or sun to shine by day
It was the new Jerusalem that would not pass away
It was the new Jerusalem that would not pass away

Jerusalem, Jerusalem
Sing for the night is o'er
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna for evermore
Hosanna in the highest

Michael Crawford,"Mary are you sleeping?
Mary I'm afraid
Mary can I live up to
The choice that God has made?
Jesus can You tell me
Here upon my knee
What kind of father will I be?

What can I give to You
You, made from miracles
That God has given me to keep?
I can't give much to You
You, made from miracles
But I can hold You as You sleep

What can You learn from me
You, made from miracles
When I've so much to learn from You?
What can a man like me 
Offer the Miracle
Who taught me miracles come true

Tell me how to guide You
Tell me what to say
Tell me how to show You how 
To show the world the Way
How to please the angels
Watching from above
When all I have to give You is love.

But if it's love You need
You made from miracles
Then take my hand and hold it tight
And I will give you love

That God has given me tonight

Would one day walk on water?

Would save our sons and daughters?

Has come to make you new?

Will soon deliver you

Will give sight to a blind man?

Will calm the storm with His hand?

Did you know that your Baby Boy
Has walked where angels trod?

Then You've kissed the face of God?

Mary, did you know

The blind will see, the deaf will hear
The dead will live again
The lame will leap, the dumb will speak

Mary, did you know that your Baby Boy
Is Lord of all creation?

Will one day rule the nations?

Michael Crawford,"I peeked in to say goodnight
When I heard my child in prayer
And for me some scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for my hair

All the stores were closed and shuttered
All the streets were dark and bare
In our town, no scarlet ribbons
Not one ribbon for her hair

Through the night my heart was aching
And just before the dawn was breaking
I peeked in and on her bed
In gay profusion lying there
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair

If I live to be a hundred
I will never know from where
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons

And that world will last forever

Michael Crawford,"Nighttime sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses

Slowly, gently night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it; sense it, tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes; let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before.

Softly, deftly music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you can not fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start a journey though a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night",Music of the Night [DVD]

You never show a sign

No illusion when your work is done

Did you ever dream
Hesitate wonder why
At all the anger you have seen
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh

Does your blood run cold
No light shines in your eyes
No burning flame in your soul

Your commission was written in the sand
No emotion could ever stay your hand
No consolation no word of love or praise
Your fight is over
Your enemies are gone
Your fight is over

사방에 짙은 안개뿐인 반 지하도
견디고 버티다 보니 뭐 괜찮았어
그래도 택시 타는 녀석은
좀 배 아팠어
하나 둘 배고픔에 떠나갈 때
나 역시 고민했었지만
결과는 반대
하나 둘 팬들이 더 쌓여갈 때
음악과 맘은 같았지만
뭘 하든 깠네
그래도 뭐 어쩌겠어
잡초 같은 걸
아직도 빛나는 그 애들처럼
산소 같은 걸
그냥 좀비처럼 걸어 세상을 얻다
모든 걸 고통 없이
원한다면 해답은 없다

충분히 할 수 있으니 believe

한 계단씩 걸어
from the gutter to the top
Never 떨어

서러웠던 날의 어깨의 먼지 털어

Like a drummer in the back
너넨 뒷북이나 쳐
마음이 뒤틀린

누구나 깎아내는
조각가들 신물이 났어
차라리 신문이나 펴
요즘의 경제면처럼 마땅한
대안 없는 음악 믿음이 안 서
착실한 기반 닦은 확실한 상품
어설픈 화가들의 막 칠한 작품
둘 중 하나를 분명히 해
이력서를 써
결과야 뭐 어떻던 미련은 못써

Michael English,"Each of us has come here
With a story of our own
But we wait in restless silence
So no one ever knows
There is one who sits in loneliness
On the edge of despair
While another person longs to love
With so much life to share

Someone cannot feel the warmth of love
Through a wall that's built with time
Being burned so often 
Makes the heart as cold as ice
There's somebody hurting
From a wound that doesn't heal
And the touch of human hands
Could bring a comfort that is real

Which one are you
Which one are you near
Can you reach across the emptiness
Can you touch the heart of someone here

[Chorus]
Take the time
To love somebody
Oh take the time
To show someone you care
Will you have another chance to be
The answer to a prayer
Take the time

We come from different places
And the pain has different names
With different circumstances
But the feelings are the same
If we let down our defenses
And we tear down all the walls
In the center of our souls we find
No differences at all

Which one are you
Which one are you near
Can you reach across the emptiness
Can you touch the heart of someone here

Take the time
To love somebody
Oh take the time
To show someone you care
Will you have another chance to be
The answer to a prayer
Take the time

There's a time when only you will know
When the Spirit speaks within your soul
Dare to reach beyond yourself
And let love go

Come on and take the time
To show someone you care
Will you have another chance to be",Take the Time

Michael English,"I dreamed of a city called Glory,
So bright and so fair.
When I entered the gates I cried, ""Holy""
The angels all met me there:
They carried me from mansion to mansion,
And oh the sights I saw,
But I said, ""I want to see Jesus,
The One who died for all.""

[Chorus]
Then I bowed on my knees and cried,
""Holy, Holy, Holy.""
I clapped my hands and sang, ""Glory,
Glory to the Son of God.""
I bowed on my knees and cried,
""Holy, Holy, Holy.""
Then I clapped my hands and sang, ""Glory,
Glory to the Son of God.""

As I entered the gates of that city,
My loved ones all knew me well.
They took me down the streets of Heaven;
Such scenes were too many to tell;
I saw Abraham, Jacob and Isaac
Talked with Mark, and Timothy
But I said, ""I want to see Jesus,
'Cause He's the One who died for me.""

They’d seen in me true love displayed
Blessed by something I had done for them

No sooner did they speak those words
I found myself somehow disturbed
Uneasy as I took their compliment

‘Cause I know the heart inside this man
I know the truth of who I am

The only thing that’s good in me is Jesus
The only thing that’s good in me is Jesus
I’ve lived long enough to know
No matter what this life may show
The only thing that’s good in me is Jesus

If you could walk the hallways of my heart
And see things as they really are
I wonder if you might be surprised

Seeing faded walls of pride and fear
Rooms I’ve filled with faithless tears
And corners where I’ve stood in compromise

Oh, but you’d see the work His grace has done
You’d know just how far I’ve come

The only thing that’s good in me is Jesus
The only thing that’s good in me is Jesus
I’ve lived long enough to know
No matter what this life may show
The only thing that’s good in me is Jesus

And in a thousand years
When the dust of this world clears
And I look back on my life
And I'll see in perfect light

Michael Feinstein,"You were my adored one
Then you became the bored one
And I was like a toy that brought you joy one day
A broken toy that you preferred to throw away

If I expected love when first we kissed, blame it on my youth
If only just for you I did exist, blame it on my youth
I believed in everything like a child of three
You meant more than anything all the world to me

If you were on my mind all night and the day, blame it on my youth
If I forgot to eat and sleep and pray, blame it on my youth

And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,

And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You

Nothing lasts, people change

Every time I lost another lover
I call up my old friend
And I say let's get together
I'm under the weather

And she listens as I tell her my sad story
And wonders at my taste in friends
And we ponder why I do it
And the pain of getting through it
And she laughs and says, ""You'll do it again""

But we sit in a bar and talk till two
'Bout life and love as old friends do
And tell each other what we've been through
Our love is rare, life is strange
Nothing lasts, people change

And I ask her if her life is ever lonely
And if she ever feels despair
And she says she's learn to love it
Cause that's really all part of it
And it helps her feel the good time when they're there

Yes, we sit in a bar and talk till two
About life and love as old friends do
And tell each other what we've been through
Our love is rare, life is strange
Nothing lasts, people change

And we wander if I live with any lovers
Or spent my life alone
And the bartender is dozing
And it's getting time for closing
So we figured that I'll go out on my own

But we'll meet the year was '62
And travel the world as old friends do
And tell each other what we've been through

But people from Missouri never incensed me

When he said, ""The world was round""
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound
They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother
When they said that man could fly

They told Marconi
Wireless was a phony
It's the same old cry

They laughed at me wantin' you
Said I was reaching for the moon
But oh, you came through
Now they'll have to change their tune

They all said we never could be happy
They laughed at us and how
But ho, ho, ho

Now they're fighting to get in
They all laughed at Whitney and his cotton gin
They all laughed at Fulton and his steamboat
Hershey and his chocolate bar

Ford and his Lizzie
Kept the laughers busy
That's how people are

They laughed at me wantin' you
Said it would be, 'Hello', 'Goodbye'
But oh, you came through
Now they're eating humble pie

They all said we'd never get together

That will keep me loving you
And with your permission
May I list a few

The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No they can't take that away from me

We may never never meet again, on that bumpy road to love
But I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No they can't take that away from me

That sounds alright in a careless rhyme
But there's seldom a second time

Better luck next time
That could never be
Because there ain't gonna be no next time

To make another start
I've made my mind up but I can't make up

But this comes just once in a lifetime
not twice

A fine romance, my friend this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes
A fine romance, you won't nestle
A fine romance, you won't wrestle
I might as well play bridge
With my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals
In the arctic ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion
A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance
This is a fine romance",A Fine Romance
Michael Feinstein,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?
Michael Feinstein,"I wanna be loved with inspiration!
I wanna be loved, starting tonight
Instead of merely holding conversation
Hold me tight

I wanna be kissed until I tingle
I wanna be kissed starting tonight
Embrace until our heartbeats intermingle
Wrong or right

I feel like acting my age
I'm passed the stage of merely turtle-doving
(Be careful, be careful, what you do)
I'm in no mood to resist,
And I insist the world owes me a loving

I wanna be thrilled to desperation
I wanna be thrilled, starting tonight
(Love me, love me, love me)
With every kind of wonderful sensation
I wanna be loved

I feel like acting my age
I'm past the stage of merely turtle-doving
I'm in no mood to resist
And I insist the world owes me a loving

I wanna be thrilled to desperation
I wanna be thrilled, starting tonight
With every kind of wonderful sensation
I wanna be loved!

Michael Feinstein,"Isn't it romantic
Music in the air
A dream that can be heard

Isn't it romantic
Moving shadows write the only magic word
I hear the music playing in the trees above
While all the world is saying you were meant for love

Isn't it romantic
Merely to be young on such a night as this
Isn't it romantic
Every note that sounds is like a lovers kiss

Sweet symbols in the moonlight
Do you think that I will fall in love per chance
Isn't it romance",Isn't It Romantic?
Michael Feinstein,"Though the world has grown cold
We can vanish the chill
We can order the present to vanish at will

We can darken the room, we can start the machine
And from here in the gloom, as we gaze at the screen
We can step into yesterday, still, we can step into yesterday, still

Oh, wasn't it romantic? All storybook and song
You fragile as a snowflake, I resolute and strong
How lovely the glow that I recall, how lovely to know that love was all

White willows in the moonlight, bright silver in the street
Oh, did it really happen, or was it just a dream?
No matter, I still await the moment when I will know romance again

Isn't it romantic? Oh, wasn't it romantic?
Music in the night, all storybook and song
A dream that can be heard

Isn't it romantic? You fragile as a snowflake
Moving shadows write, I resolute and strong
The oldest magic word, how lovely the glow that I recall

I hear the breezes playing in the trees above
How lovely to know that love was all while all the world is saying
You were meant for love

Isn't it romantic? White willows in the moonlight
Merely to be young, bright silver in the street
On such a night as this

Isn't it romantic? Oh, did it really happen
Every note that's sung or was it just a dream?
Is like a lover's kiss
No matter, I still await sweet symbols in the moonlight

The moment when, do you mean that I will fall in love perchance?
I will know romance again, Isn't it romance?
Wasn't it romance?",Wasn't It Romantic
Michael Feinstein,"Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

",Where Do You Start?
Michael Feinstein,"Must I memorize a book
To be considered wise
When I can look into your eyes?

Literature is such a bore
And mathematics too
I'd much prefer to learn about you

You're the only kind of knowledge
They don't teach at any college
You're an education in yourself

There are poems and romances
In the glamor of your glances
You're an education in yourself

Of all the famous dates in history
I recall but a few
The fourth of July
And my dates with you

You've a kiss that's scientific
Though it's tender it's terrific
You're an education in yourself

You're the kind of mental training
I could take without complaining
You're an education in yourself

Intricate as economics
Simple as the Sunday comics
You're an education in yourself

And there are geometric figures
In your beautiful curves
They're good on the eyes
But bad for the nerves

You are my encyclopedia
Let me take you home and read ya
You're an education in yourself

Michael Feinstein,"I could while away the hours
Conferrin' with the flowers

Not a sign of a cloud passing by
And if I want to sing, throw my heart in the ring

There is sunshine everywhere
There are people greeting people
And a feeling of Spring in the air

Or the scene where the villain is mean.

Or he bride with the guy by her side
Or the ball where she gives it her all.
That's entertainment!

So lucky to be loving you
So lucky to be the one you run to see
In the evening, when the day is through

Michael Feinstein,"Wonder why I'm not myself off late
I'm feeling strangely great, I wonder why
I suppose some genius could explain
Why I walk in the rain, just let him try

I guess there is a simple explanation
Unless I've come up with a new sensation
It could be that she's caught up with me
And all the mystery I'm speaking of
Is simply that I went and fell in love

Wonder why I haven't been the same
Since I first heard your name, I wonder why
And what's more, I do peculiar things
Like gaze at wedding rings, I wonder why

What makes a man with two left feet a dancer
It takes a wiser man I guess to answer
It could be that she's caught up with me
And all the mystery I've mentioned above
Is simply that I went and fell in love

Michael Feinstein,"How could you believe me when I said I love you 
When you know I've been a liar all my life
I've had that reputation since I was a youth
You must have been insane to think I'd tell you the truth
How could you believe me when I said we'd marry 
When you know I'd rather hang than have a wife
I know I said I'd make you mine
But who would know that you would go for that old line
How could you believe me when I said I love you
When you know I've been a liar
Nothing but a liar, all my doggone cheatin' life
 
(Girl) You said you would love me long, and never would do me wrong
And faithful you'd always be
(Boy) Oh, baby, you must be loony to trust a lower than low two time like me

A bungalow by the sea

(Boy) I was lyin' I was down in Alabama!

Michael Feinstein,"Strange, there's a fundamental change
Love is now within my range
Like it's never been before
And I can hardly wait for someone
To share my days, my nights and more

Seems you keep starring in my dreams
With their new recurring themes
Maybe one might just come true
I hear that life is great in that blissful state
I can hardly wait to find me there with you

It's not as if I never had the chance at all
It's not as if I didn't really try
I guess my heart just never learned to dance at all
It might have been my timing

More accustomed to the glow
That you've introduced me to

Everywhere an orchid grows you are,

A Swiss Alp as the sun grows fainter,
You're Loch Lomond when autumn is the painter.
You're Moonlight on a night in Capri,
And Cape Cod looking out at the sea,
You're all places that leave me breathless,
And no wonder: you're all the world to me.

You're Lake Como when dawn is aglow,
You're Sun Valley right after a snow.
A museum, a Persian palace,
You're my shining Aurora Borealis

When I want rain, I get sunny weather

Since love is gone, can't get myself together
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry

Friends ask me out and I tell them I'm busy
Must get a new alibi
I stay at home and ask myself, ""Where is she?""

Hanging on a stream of dreams
Fly little memories, my little memories
Remind her of our crazy schemes

The midway and the fun, the kewpie dolls we won
The bell I rang to prove that I was strong
The things we did last summer I'll remember all winter long

The early morning hike, the rented tandem bike
The lunches that we used to pack
We never could explain that sudden summer rain
The looks we got when we got back

The leaves began to fade like promises we made
How could a love that seemed so right go wrong?

Michael Feinstein,"Here we are in court today
Rose just took the stand
She's divorcin' me for reasons
I still don't understand

That dress is showin' more of her
Than I've seen in years
And the story that she's tellin's
Even got the judge in tears

She's accusin' me of hangin' out
With girls of ill repute
Adultery, abandonment
Even alcohol abuse

I just heard my mother shout
Your honor throw the book
And even my attorney
Just gave me a dirty look

The kids and all the cash
Everything's coming up roses

If I keep the shirt that's on my back

She got all I ever made
And all I'll ever earn

If I had a handkerchief
I'd break right down and cry
Why, even Johnny Carson
Got a better deal than mine

It's worth its heartache in ransom
And when that twilight steals
I know how the lady in the harbor feels

When I want rain, I get sunny weather
I'm just as blue as the sky
Since love is gone, can't get myself together
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry

Friends ask me out and I tell them I'm busy
Must get a new alibi
I stay at home and ask myself, ""Where is she?""
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry

Dry little tear drops, my little tear drops
Hanging on a stream of dreams
Fly little memories, my little memories
Remind her of our crazy schemes

Yes, somebody says, just forget about her
So I gave that treatment a try
And strangely enough I got along without her
Then one day she passed me right by, oh, well

Cause his is the only music that makes me dance.

Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Michael Feinstein,"There will be rainbows, there will be sunsets
And there'll be parties and fireworks and music enough to dance
And there'll be chances to take, money to make

Out in the madding crowd you'll be allowed to push and shove
There will be laughter, there will be heartache
No one to follow your rivers, through mountains to oceans wide

But don't forget little man, keep this if you can
Listen and please be wise, no matter what the price you're dreamin' of
Make time enough for love, time enough for love

Like glorious, glamorous and that old standby amorous
It's all too wonderful, I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough, I mean they just aren't swell enough

You're much too much and just too very, very
To ever be in Webster's Dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for words

You're much, you're too much and just too very, very

Michael Feinstein,"In the evening when the cattle's [Incomprehensible]
An old familiar feeling settles over me
And it's your face I see and I believe that you are there

In the garden when I stop to touch a rose
And feel the petal soft and sweet against my nose
I smile and I suppose that somehow maybe you are there

When I'm dreaming and I find myself awake
Without a warning and I rub my eyes and fantasize
And all at once I realize it's morning

And my fantasy is fading like a distant star of dawn
My dearest dream is gone
I often think there's just one thing to do
Pretend the dream is true and tell myself that you are there",You Are There
Michael Feinstein,"You coax the blues right out of the horn, Mame
You charm the husk right off of the corn, Mame
You've got the banjos strummin' and plunkin' out a tune to beat the band
The whole plantation's hummin' since you brought Dixie back to Dixieland.
You make our cotton easy to pick, Mame
You give my old mint julep a kick, Mame
You make the old magnolia tree blossom at the mention of your name.
You've made us feel alive again, you've given us the drive again
to make the South revive again, Mame.
You brought the cakewalk back into style, Mame
You make the weeping willow tree smile, Mame
Your skin is Dixie satin, there's rebel in your manner and your speech
You may be from Manhattan, but Georgia never had a sweeter peach.
You make our blackeyed peas and our grits, Mame
Seem like the bill of fare at the Ritz, Mame
You came, you saw, you conquered and absolutely nothing is the same.
Your special fascination'll prove to be inspirational, we think you're just sensational,

Michael Feinstein,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, just for you only,
Why haven't you seen it?
I'm all for you, body and soul!

I spent my days in longing
And wondering why, why it's me that you're wronging?
I tell you that I mean it
I'm all for you, body and soul!

I can't believe it, it's hard to conceive it
That you turn away romance
Are you pretending? Because it looks like the ending
Unless I could have one more chance to prove dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours just for the taking
I would gladly surrender,

Michael Feinstein,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Michael Feinstein,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me
Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for
We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love
Michael Feinstein,"For love alone, I did what otherwise I never could have done
Though if I lost a race or two, I should have won
And aimed a few too many arrows at the sun, it has been fun

When I was sure how very steep the price can be when love goes wrong
I held my hasty hardened check but not for long
Somehow I never could resist that siren song

If some dark day, I wake to find the love I felt was here to stay
Has slipped away
I'll simply say, these are the breaks, one makes mistakes

I bought the lies but now I'm wise
And from the ashes like the Phoenix I will rise
And sail the skies for nothing dies that flies for love alone

But now I'm wise

Michael Feinstein,"In a world of glitter and glow
In a world of tinsel and show
The unreal from the real thing is hard to know
I discovered somebody who
Could be truly worthy and true
Yes, I met my ideal thing when I met you

I see your face before me
Crowding my every dream
There is your face before me
You are my only theme

It doesn't matter where you are
I can see how fair you are
I close my eyes and there you are
Always

If you could share the magic
Yes, if you could see me too
There would be nothing tragic
In all my dreams of you

Would that my love could haunt you so
Knowing I want you so
I can't erase your beautiful face before me",I See Your Face Before Me
Michael Feinstein,"There may be trouble ahead
But while there's music and moonlight (moonlight and music) and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance
Before the fiddlers have fled,
Before they ask us to pay the bill, and while we still have that chance
Let's face the music and dance
Soon, we'll be without the moon, humming a different tune, and then
There may be teardrops to shed

Michael Feinstein,"Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,
But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon.

Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner.
Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.
Venus de Milo was noted for her charms,
But strictly between us, you're cuter than Venus,
And what's more you got arms.
So cuddle in a corner, any cozy corner,
Love is just around the corner and I'm around you.",Love Is Just Around the Corner
Michael Feinstein,"You know I really can't recall the details
It's horrific how the memory fails
As it fades into a blow, I forget just how things were
My mind's become a wanderer

But wasn't there a smile once so remarkable
That's it's still on fire in my book of dreams
That pile of memories, all of you

But when I saw it then through
Why do I never find a clue
To why that kissing smile withdrew
Wasn't there a moment where I knew?

Wasn't there a time when life was beautiful?
Like a pantomime
When actors move sublimely sure of what they do
And my regrets are through

But there's one mystery I still pursue
When life was beautiful and blue
Wasn't there a moment?
I can't recall the moment

But wasn't there a moment
When you loved me too?

",Wasn't There a Moment
Michael Feinstein,"I know a spot, peaceful and fair
I'd be so happy if I were there
No matter where I chance to be
Connecticut is the place for me

Miss every lake, miss every hill
Even in dreams, I think of them still
And when you see them, you'll agree
Connecticut is the place to be

Village dreams and childhood scenes
Are things that I remember yet
Land of dreams and moonlit streams
How close to heaven can you get

Nights full of stars, hearts full of joy
Paradise for a girl and a boy
I guess it suits me to a T
Connecticut is the place for me to be
Connecticut is the place for me

Sounds like a great stage for a late date
With a mate waiting just for you
And every Yale guy is a male guy
Through and through

Sounds like a great stage
It's never hum drum dating some chum
With her thumbs strumming a guitar
You'll find the chicks slicker and they mix quicker by far

Sounds like a great, great stage
It's quick and spanner then old Montana
And Indiana can't rate
The nights are longer, the men are stronger
So linger longer and wait
Cause it's a great, great, great, great stage

Circle the globe, dozens of times
Seen all its wonders and I've known all its qualms
I've searched it with a fine tooth comb
And found that I have only one home sweet home
Connecticut always will be my home sweet home",Connecticut

Birthday, November 26
Athena Malvain, Aquarius
We two will never mix

Sagittarians are fickle, untrue
Up to, typical, masculine tricks
Aquarians are constant, like you
So, we're in an awful fix

I have the Sun and Saturn
You have the moon in your arms
Beware, this ill starred pattern
I'll forget you if I'm wise

But a man in love is never wise
Sometimes he even defies the skies

Love can change the stars
Whenever it's strong enough
Believe in it long enough
It will happen, somehow

Rearrange the stars
Love gives us the power for it
Remember the hour for it, is now

So, darling, even when we're apart
Take my hand in your arm
Keep me locked in your heart
And I won't be alone

Soon, we'll kiss and stars will fade in the mist, for me
They'll only exist for me
If they shine in your arms

When two hearts are entwined
Venus waltz's with Mars
Hand in hand, we will find
Love can change the stars

""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine

For love is in the air beside a summer sea

There's a big affair awaiting you and me
Something in the weather caused you every heart
Time to get together with a new love swearing true love

Ripples hug the shore and kiss the burning sand
Nature is imploring you to take a hand
So if you are fancy free, this is where you ought to be

I'm about the luckiest man in the world
To have a girl like you, I'm told by Fritz and Peter
Your lips would not be sweeter

Oh, you must be a marvelous thing to delight
The many men you do, the secrets they can find
Have made me swell with pride

Who delight in panning the dancing teachers,
Let me tell you there are a lot of features
Of the dance that carry you through
The gates of Hea-ven.
It's madness
To be always sitting around in sadness,
When you could be learning the steps of gladness.
You'll be happy when you can do
Just six or seven;
Begin to day!
You'll find it nice,
The quickest way to paradise.
When you practice,
Here's the thing to know,
Simply say as you go

[Chorus]
I'll build a stairway to paradise
With a new step ev'ry day!
I'm gonna get there at any price;
Stand aside, I'm on my way!
I've got the blues
And up above it's so fair.
Shoes! Go on and carry me there!
I'll build a stairway to paradise
With a new step ev'ry day.

Ev'ry new step
Helps a bit; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven.
Get bu-sy;
Dance with Maud the countess, or just plain Lizzy:
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.
When you've learn'd to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out.
In time you'll get Saint Vitus dance,
Which beats the latest thing from France.
Take no chances on this Paradise;
Let me give you advice.

Maybe we really belong together
But after all how little we know

Maybe it's just for a day
Love is as changeable as the weather
And after all how little we know

Who knows why an April breeze never remains
Why stars in the trees hide when it rains
Love comes along casting a spell
Will it sing you a song? Will it say a farewell?
Who can tell?

Maybe you're meant to be mine
Maybe I'm only supposed to stay in your arms a while

Is this what I've waited for am I the one

No, I ain't been uptown, what's uptown?

And I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun for another overload

Every time we say goodbye, I wonder why a little,
Why the Gods above me, who must be in the know.
Think so little of me, they allow you to go.

I can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it,
There's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to minor,
Every time we say goodbye.

She almost makes the day begin

I was serenely independent and content before we met
Surely I could always be that way again and yet

Accustomed to her face

She's second nature to me now

More lost without you and so it goes

And we're capable of take each other's souls
We do it every day
Just to reach some financial goal

Isn't it a pity, my God
And so unnecessary

Michael Feinstein,"My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by

Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true

Michael Feinstein,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Michael Feinstein,"Love is rare, life is strange
Nothing lasts, people change

Every time I lost another lover
I call up my old friend
And I say let's get together
I'm under the weather
Another love has come to an end

And she listens as I tell her my sad story
And wonders at my taste in friends
And we ponder why I do it
And the pain of getting through it
And she laughs and says, ""You'll do it again""

But we sit in a bar and talk till two
'Bout life and love as old friends do
And tell each other what we've been through
Our love is rare, life is strange
Nothing lasts, people change

And I ask her if her life is ever lonely
And if she ever feels despair
And she says she's learn to love it
'Cause that's really all part of it
And it helps her feel the good time when they're there

Yes, we sit in a bar and talk till two
About life and love as old friends do
And tell each other what we've been through
Our love is rare, life is strange
Nothing lasts, people change

And we wander if I live with any lovers
Or spent my life alone
And the bartender is dozing
And it's getting time for closing
So we figured that I'll go out on my own

But we'll meet the year was '62
And travel the world as old friends do
And tell each other what we've been through
Our love is rare, life is strange
Nothing lasts, people change

Love is rare, life is strange
Nothing lasts, people change

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only woman I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add her initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that she turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

May I list a few

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No they can't take that away from me

We may never never meet again, on that bumpy road to love
But I'll always, always keep the memory of

Antique lace and acrame

With a daisy chain or a baby's hand and

Oh so elegantly she stands with a stolen rose
Rings for her fingers and a kiss for her nose
And will have music wherever she goes

The lady wears the best perfume
Takes her time in her old man's bathroom
She lures the old man to his doom

Or a helping of strawberry pie
Served up right between his eyes

You know revenge is swift an sticky and
Yes she may have one of these
And yes she may have one of those
Rings for her fingers and a kiss for her nose

In borrowed room or a fine hotel

Michael Feinstein,"Life begins and the spirits rise
They become memories that vaporize
And the vapor becomes all the dreams we devise
And while we are dreaming, time flies

Night turns to dawn and dreams to sighs
And sighs change to sweet love that never dies
And love becomes laughter and lullabies
And while we are dreaming, time flies

And while we are dreaming we meet and exchange
Conversations routinely and nothing seems strange
But when we are awake there's a sense of unease
That another night's gone just as quick as you please

And night turns to dawn and then bright skies
And bright skies to picnics on warm Julys
To deep umber autumns and winter goodbyes
And while we are dreaming, time flies

While we are dreaming, time flies
Time flies, time flies, time flies

Imagining what could have been or should have been

But here we are, we've come so far
Will you and I say the same goodbye again?","The Same Hello, The Same Goodbye"
Michael Feinstein,"I'd like to get away, honey
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, honey
You need a laugh or two

A certain place I know, darling
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go, darling
Before you can count up
One, two, three, four

There's a small hotel with a wishing well
I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people
Who wants people?

When the steeple bell says
Good night, sleep well
We'll thank the small hotel together

Michael Feinstein,"You go to my head and you linger
Like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning 'round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head like a sip
Of sparkling Burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought that you
Might give a thought to my plea
Casts a spell over me
Still I say to myself, get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head with a smile
That makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julys
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

I wish I knew you place no one above me

And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap

once again runnin' away with me.
It was just my imagination runnin' away with me. Oo
 
Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)

Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.

In her prison of wishes

We love and we fight but it's all day for night just a masquerade

Oh woe is we
Who know where it will end
Hard luck follows us
Minus never plus
Will we break or just bend
Never say die
We've got the worst behind us
If we just try
Soon we'll be feeling strong
Cancel that frown
Somehow the light will find us
Can't keep us down
Well at least not for long
Worry's worn us thin
But when our ship comes in
All our troubles will fold
We're a perfect fit
Come to think of it
Love's more precious than gold

Michael Franks,"Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreamin' of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray

Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I pray 
I could breakaway

I'll spread my wings, and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish
Take a chance
Make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk 
Take a chance
Make a change
And breakaway

Want to feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get on board a fast train
Travel on a jet plane
Faraway
And breakaway

I'll spread my wings, and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Swinging 'round revolvin' doors
Maybe I don't know where they take me
But gotta keep movin' on
Movin' on
Fly away

I'll spread my wings, and I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye

But I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Michael Franks,"Here we are again
That fatal combination
I guess it's opposite attraction
It's gone too far again
This crazy conversation
It's like a nuclear reaction
Lady your lip service has no rival
Don't you know deception is uncouth?
Didn't you read somewhere in the Bible
Not to bend the truth?
If you think your lip service will amaze me
You're utterly confused - that much is clear
'Cause baby your lip service doesn't faze me
It's so insincere
It's only lip service
It's nothin' but lip service
There you are again
Unable to conceal it
That hourglass configuration
It's gone too far again
Believe me, I can feel it
I can't resist that old temptation
Lady your lip service can be vicious
Don't you know deception is uncouth?
However your lips look so delicious
While they bend the truth
Give me some lip service, just attack me
I know I have asked you to be real
But sometimes your lip service is exactly
What I want to feel
Tired of of truces
Eloquence is useless
Eighty-six it
'Cause all this talk won't fix it

Michael Franks,"Lovers from Shakespeare come to mind
The ""parting is such sweet""
""Wherefore art thou"" kind
Shattered illusions, sad conclusions
When I think of us
Love called the shots and we believed
We gave new meaning to the word ""naive""
Can't comprehend the logic of love
When I think of us
How it exploded I don't know
Right out of nowhere
We ran out of mistletoe
Still I remember only good times
When I think of us
We were young and our hearts were broken when love was lost
The pain we concealed
Somehow time has healed
We tried hard but I
Guess we failed the test
Does it matter why?
Just remember I
Hope you're happy I
Wish you all the best
Who could predict the end of spring?
We were in love and love was everything
Promises broken, cruel words spoken
When I think of us
How it exploded I can't say
Right out of nowhere
The rain washed it all away
Still I remember only good times
When I think of us
We were young and our hearts were broken when love was lost

Oh the gardenia scent is sweet
Remember me, I'm from out West and

Sometimes a cloud
Sails along harmlessly

Sharing a warm baguette
Coffee with anisette
We kissed in the Metro

And it always reminds me of you
And happily now all these many years hence
You are still by my side, Samba Blue

Written on the back of God's hand

Plantin' seeds and pickin' weeds for another season
Another reason for livin' another reason for givin'
Another reason for lovin' and tryin' stay out of prison
'cause everything in life can't be nice and
Everything you want can't be got
But the lessons on patient be causing the pressure to rise
And make some people suicidal
Oh no! another soul, has lost control
We pull him back into the fold

All the superficial initials upon his clothes
They make me wanna go Sprewell

Uh-huh, the economical can be demonical
Keep love in your soul

Ya see people are so beautiful in love
That's why I'm reminded of life's precious moments every time
I see lovers walkin' by in the park
Close my eyes and I stop reminisce
To see a little baby suckin' on his mama's
Milk-ey silky smoothness of a lovin' caress holdin' baby to breast
And blessin' the world with another to test, test, test
Oh-yes, oh-yes Bom-bom!

Right from the start in a world torn apart
A baby's love leaves finger prints upon the heart
So many think it, but never say it
""why bring a child to this planet full of hatred?""
They might not make it like the youngest departed
Or worst of all they might become a part of it
Involved in it, perpetuating violence, violence
And growing up in silence
Seein' things they don't know how to deal with
And learnin' ways, to try to cope with it
Cope with it, cope with it
And not lose hope

[Chorus]",Every Single Soul
Michael Franti,"Six foot six above sea level
I grab the mic because I take you to
Another mental level
Low power frequency radio modulation

The big sound from the underground another pirate radio station
We bring the truth to places truth is never heard before
We bring the sound communication of our tribal war
Dark vision fly by helicopters in the night
Attempt triangulation of our station in the fight

Straight from the bass the deep down low precision
High crime treason we broadcastin' sedission
Like the wall street mornin' afternoon edition
Commandeering airwaves from unknown positions

[Chorus]
Live and direct we comin' never pre-recorded
With information that will never be reported
Disregard the mainstream media distorted
Whoop! whoop!
We comin' listener supported

Don't take no prisoners if can't afford to feed none
Don't start no fights if you can't predict the outcome
Don't make donations where you cannot get your dough back
Fuck the apathetic bullshittas send em' all your prozac

I will not climb into your telephone tree
And ""hell no you can't put me on hold!""
It's the same recorded message you'd been singin' all along
Keep handin' us the bible while you walkin' off with all the gold

The bureaucratic office sends you merry-go-rounding
While the KKK police the streets by blood hounding
Interest on the credit card just keeps on compounding
But the FCC can neva shut this pirate sound down

[Chorus]",Listener Supported
Michael Franti,"Seems like everyday gets a little bit longer
Seems like yesterday I was a little but stronger
But there ain't nothin'
Nothin' I can't do
But to hold my ground
Try not to come unwound
Don't wanna be let down
But it ain't easy
Doin' hard time
For somebody else's crime

[Chorus]
Hate is what got me here
But I know that love sweet love is gonna set me free
All the hatred in the world is what got me here today
But I know that love is gonna set me free

Man I been away for so long now
I ain't seen no daylight for God knows how long now
I come out fightin' when I hear that bell ring
I always hear my name
But I'd love to feel the rain come down one mo time
Wash away my pain
Love like a hurricane

[Chorus]",Love'll Set Me Free
Michael Franti,"[Chorus]
Oh-my, oh-my God!
Out here mama they got us livin' suicide
Singin' oh-my, oh-my God!
Out here mama they got us livin' genocide 

Slam bam I come unseen
But like gasoline you can tell I'm in the tank
Like money in the bank
I smell appealing, but I'm toxic, can send ya reeling
Without an inklin', keep ya thinkin'
'cause you gave cash to the feds, left your school district for dead
Fucked you up in the head, but still they sayin' nothin's wrong
Sellin' firewater but outlawing the bong
Still believing the system is workin'
While half of my people are still outta workin'
Anonymous notes left in the pockets and coats
Of judges and juries from 'Frisco to Jersey
Threats and protests politicians mob debts
Trumped up charges and phoney arrests
Stage a lethal injection, the night before the election
'cause he got donations from the prison guard's union

[Chorus]

Listen in to my stethoscope on a rope
International lullabies, human cries
Thumps and silence, the language of violence
Algorithmic, cataclysmic, seismic, biorhythmic
You can make a life longer, but you can't save it
You can make a clone an then you try to enslave it?
Stealin' DNA samples from the onborn
And then you comin' after us
'cause we sampled a James Brown horn?
Scientists who's God is progress
A four-headed sheep is their latest project
The CIA runnin' like that Jones from Indiana
But they still won't talk about that (Jim) Jones 
(People's Temple mass suicide) in Guyana
This ain't no cartoon
No one slips on bananas
Do you really think that that car killed Diana
Hell I shot Ronald Reagan, I shot JFK,
I slept with Marilyn (Monroe) she sung me happy birthday
Singin'

[Chorus]

Well politicians got lipstick on the collar
The whole media started to holler
But I don't give a fuck who they screwin' in private
I want to know who they screwin' in public
Robbin', cheatin', stealin'
White collar criminal
McDonald eatin', you deserve a beatin'
Send you home a weepin', with a fat bill for your
Caribbean weekend
For just about anything they can bust us
False advertising sayin' ""halls of Justice''
You tellin' the youth don't be so violent
Then you drop bombs on every single continent
Mandatory minimum sentencin'
'cause he got caught with a pocket fulla medicine
Do that again another ten up in the pen
I feel so mad I want to bomb an institution
Singin'

[Chorus]",Oh My God
Michael Franti,"We livin' in a mean time and an aggressive time
A painful time, a time where cynicism rots to the vine
In a time where violence blocks the summer shine
Lifetimes, go by in a flash
In search for love, in search for cash
Everybody want to be some fat tycoon
Everybody want to be on a tropic honeymoon
Nobody want to sing a little bit out of tune
Or be the backbone of a rebel platoon
It's too soon to step out of line
You might get laughed at you might get fined
But do you feel me when I say I feel pain everyday
When I see the way my friends gotta slave
And never get ahead of bills they gotta pay
No way no way!
Some make a living doing killing Colombian penicillin
Some are willing to play the villain they just chillin'
To pass the time, pass the information
Or pass the wine
Pass the buck or pass the baton
But you can't pass the police or the pentagon
The I.R.S. or the upper echelon
I think it's time to make a move on the contradiction 

[Chorus]
Bom-Bom, rock the nation
Take over television and radio station

Bom-Bom the truth shall come
Give the corporation some complication! 

This is the dawning of our time I say it one more time
To emphasize the meaning of my rhyme
To rise above all the dirt and grime
Add the right spice at the right time
Fuck the constitution
Are we part of the solution or are we part of the pollution
Sittin' by and wonderin' why,
Things ain't the way we like to find them to be, to be
For you and for me the people over there and the ones in between
Check our habitation are we a peace lovin' nation
Peace lovin' nation
I have a reasonable doubt I think I'll just spell it out
There's no need to scream or to shout
The N.R.A. just bought a man's soul
Then he jumps up and shouts gun control
The government says that killing's a sin
Unless you kill a murderer with a lethal syringe
So I ask again ""are we peace lover's then""
Some of them slang guns when they six years old
Some of them end up in some six foot hole
This whole damn place seems to, lost control
So I raise my voice before I lose my soul

[Chorus]

This is the way I'll express my feelings
Vibe revealed and revolved spinning on a record y'all
Try to confiscate take what I communicate with
It's ancient gift of the lip steady creating
Activating passing vocal vibrations to the blind plus the seeing
Human doesn't mean just being
Be coming don't believe it just belife it
Belongings or beloved rehearse it or recite it
While shining drop your guns and move your tongues
Battle motivation in no time lyrics come
Sometimes fun others run their mouth or away
My mind co beaming like an early sun ray
One day we'll get the picture and all combine
Less the talking bout mines is mine and become one mind
Every piece of the puzzle has its place
To build the piece of the puzzle called the human race 

Taking it long enough we crush the formal journalistic
Dyslexic critters talk backwards to rap words
I'm sure raising my hands with questions and demands
Statements and a plan with a map of the land

[Chorus]",Rock the Nation
Michael Franti,"I was born botanical
the soul of an animal
deep beneath the layers, I sink my roots
no need for mechanical
I come strictly organical
when I need to feast, I look to the East
that's why I'm never scared of the beast
even though they try to prey upon me
I'm protected by the one always greater than me
so now I reveal to thee
because you wanna see
the contour of my mystery
the strength of my arches
the colour of my conscience
and the way that I process my diction
some fact some diction some mystery
some future fantasy
I'm the trunk that holds the branches
the leaves who do the dances
my flowers romantic
my love gigantic
from Africa, transplanted translantic
in the heat of the sun
I bring shade for everyone
like the beat on the one
I'm the skin on the drum

(chorus)
I keep on living with the fullness of the one
like the heat of the sun or the skin on the drum

I'm fully marinated and now I'm ready for the fire
so you can fire one
fire one
fire two

See I've been fully marinated
and now I'm ready for the fire
see I'm beginning to perspire
from deep within to the skin
yo, the feminine and the masculine
the pieces of the puzzle
see my reflections in the puddle
after the storm the purple of the sky
brings to mind another time
when we resided 
below the water line
life was fine there human divine
but in the years following
evil men came swallowing
everything in sight
some learned to run, some stayed to fight
I kneeled at the tomb of the soldier
said I would love to behold her
the magic in store there
she touched me on the shoulder
she said, ""in time all is revealed, box of light be unsealed
now listen to me son, be like the skin on the drum""
(chorus)

And as the pepper gas clears
and police and protesters go home
just as the morning dew are tear drops of the night
my emotions are always there for you
and will never leave you dry

Michael Franti,"The world around gotcha down
You got high blood pressure, people pushing you around
And some wanna tell you how you should behave
Cut your hair the right way, tell you what to say,
Hang out with the right folks, become a fashion slave

But do you wanna feel free (and I say it again now)
But do you wanna feel freaky and free
But do you wanna feel free (I don't care where you come from)
Do you wanna feel free, free, free, free, freaky and free

(Chorus:)
Take your time
Unwind your mind
We all need a little soulshine
Take your time (go on, take it)
Unwind your mind
We could use a little soulshine

9 to 5, people tryin' to stay alive
Hard livin' in the city
You find a diamond in the sewer but the gas bills rise
But I got to say to them, ""what's it all mean?""
You gotta take a loan
To pay the bill on the phone
Educated, graduated but you can't get a job

But do you wanna feel free (and I say it again now)
But do you wanna feel freaky and free
But do you wanna feel free (I don't care where you come from)
Do you wanna feel free, free, free, free, freaky and free

(Chorus)",Soulshine
Michael Franti,"You don't have to be so scared to share what's inside
'cause you're Daddy's little superstar
And you're Mama's little butterfly
Fly high

A strange strange litany of verses and reverses
Adlibs and rehearses
Clouds burst and words cursed
An argument breaks out
It's one we've all heard before, it's boring
Had us all snoring from the first line
One after another chimed in perfect time
Tired rehashes of petty cashes and mismatches
You shoulda coulda's
And ""why didn't 'tcha dida's""
Crippling snippets aimed at the heart
To inflame and impart blame
Framed like Mumia
Verbal diarrhea
Creating chasms between the souls of two
Or two billion
Nations torn apart
Station to station damnation
With much deliberation and very little consideration
To the return on the damage from the altercation
Collateral condemnation
Then denyin' like colorization of an old black and white
Create a revision of the recent last night
The fight that started with two words, ""I'm right""

[Chorus]
You don't have to be so scared to share what's inside
'cause you're Daddy's little superstar
And you're Mama's little butterfly
Fly high

But of course the fight ends with no resolution
Merely a vow for retribution, substitution, execution, electrocution
Ruthless, toothless and truthless
Mumbling through page after page of excuses
Abuses of the gift of the gab
Gabriel the trumpeter
Bestowed upon us a voice with a choice
And a tongue kept moist by years of salivating
For oysters, pearls and aphrodisiacs
Locked in an ugly shell always too chewy and gooey
So they get swallowed whole
But a tongue is so much more than a vehicle for greed
A tongue is for washing fur
Or for licking wounds
Or for welcoming newcomers into a room
Or cleansing those fresh from the womb
Without a tongue there would be no croons
Swoons, Junes under the moon
No bees pollinating no flowers in bloom
No recitation of words at the foot of a tomb
Or wills read aloud of the family heirlooms
You probably couldn't even blow up a balloon
And that would be a shame
Because to exhales the name of the game
Exhale from the heart
Not from the lungs
Exhale from the heart
Not from the tongue

[Chorus]

Listening is understanding
And finding compassion
Love is the action of soul satisfaction
A tongue can make wishes and also fine kisses
Taste a sweet cake and also cast disses
But nothing compares to the voice from within
Without it we might just be mannequins
Up to no darn good shenanigans
Learn to be skilful movers of the stones
That block the heart and turn humans to clones
Learn to forgive, set free the bones
Touch with your flesh, take off the rubber gloves
Love like your life depends on it
Because it does

[Chorus]",Speaking of Tongues
Michael Franti,"Starvation is the creation of the devil, a rebel
I'm bringin' food to the people like a widow
Bringin' flowers to a grave in the middle
Of the city isolation is a riddle
To be surrounded by a million other people
But to feel alone like a tree in a desert
Dried up like the skin of a lizard
But full of color like the spots of a leopard
Drum and bass pull me in like a shepherd
Scratch my itch like a needle on a record
Full of life like a man gone to Mecca
Sky high like an eagle up soaring
I speak low but I'm like a lion roaring
Baritone like a Robeson recordin'
I'm givin' thanks for bein' human every morning

[Chorus]
Because the streets are alive with the sound of Boom Bap
Can I hear it once again
Boom Bap tell your neighbor tell a friend
Every box gotta right to be bomin'
Because the streets are alive with the sound of Boom Bap
Can I hear it once again
Boom Bap tell your neighbor tell a friend
Every flower got a right to be boomin'

Be resistant
The negativity we keep it at a distance
Call for backup and I'll give you some assistance
Like a lifesaver deep in the ocean
Stay afloat here upon the funky motion
Rock and roll upon the waves of the season
Hold your breath and your underwater breathin'

To be rhymin' without a real reason
Is to claim but not to practice a religion
If television is the drug of the nation
Satellite is immaculate reception
Beaming in they can look and they can listen
So you see don't believe in the system
To legalize you or give you your freedom
You want rights ask em', they'll read em'
But every flower got a right to be bloomin'
Stay human

[Chorus]

All the freaky people make the beauty of the world

You see Y2K ya know is a moment
In time we find that we can open
Up a heart that's locked or been broken
By the pain of words not spoken
Or shot by guns a still smokin'
Cartwrights out on the Ponderosa
Or drive by bang in Testarossa
We need to heed the words of Dalai Lama
Or at least the words of yo mama
Take a mental trip to the Bahamas
Steam your body in a stereo sauna, sauna, comma

[Chorus]",Stay Human (All the Freaky People)
Michael Franti,"When I was a younger man
People say don't dream too tall
'Cause if you live your life this way
You set yourself up for big falls
I stay up late in my room at night
Play my hoes on my turntable
Opened me to pure phat groove
Help my soul break down them walls

(Chorus)
I thank you
I thank you for all the music 
That you've shown to me
I thank you
'Cause you set me free
Free to simply just be me

You don't know all the influence
The subtle positives that you had on me
Came about like a renaissance
Like a little happy dance, got into my feet
But in your time, the roads you chose
Led you to your hard luck blues
I always feared what it was like
To live inside your big old shoes

Do ya love music, I do
Do ya love music, I do",Thank You

We don't mind
See we've been doin' it all the time
But if you want us to you sacrifice
You will not get it without a price
We don't mind
See we've been doin' it all the time
But if you want us to you sacrifice
You gotta give something back to life

You think I'm vulnerable to your pressure tactics
Because I shed a tear, 'cause I shed a tear
You think I'm vulnerable to your violence
Just 'cause I'm sittin' here
But my babies came into this world
Without a single fear, say they has no fear
'cause the seven generations before me
They all fought to get us here

You can't just come in here like that no more
And snatch up our childhood
You just can't walk on up
And replace it yo, with your Hollywood

How all of the words I say you'll take and misconstrue
And I'm prepared now
To suffer the penalties for speakin' the truth
And I speak the truth when I say

Because a father's just a boy without a friend.
And don't fear to walk slow, 
Don't be a horse race, be a marathon.
And don't fear the long road, 
Because on the long road you got a long time to sing a simple song.

It's never too late to pick up the phone.
You know it's never too late to lay your head down on my shoulders,

Don't fear your teachers, 
Because if you listen you can hear music in a school bell.
And don't fear your preacher, 
If you can't find heaven in a prison cell.
And don't fear your own self, 
Paying money to justify your worth.
And don't fear your family, 
Because you chose them along time before your birth.

I'm a soldier but afraid sometimes 
To face the things that may 
Block the sun from shinin' rays 
And fill my life with shades of grey 
But still I long to find a way 
So today I pray for grace 

I take a moment to myself 
So I can myself 
To feel myself 
And be real myself 
Life's addictions and afflictions 
'Cause abrasions from their friction 
Sometimes, it's easier to live in fiction 
I can run, but I can't hide 
From the pains that 
Reside deep down inside 
There is no pill 
That can be swallowed 
There is no guru 
That can be followed 
There's no escapin' 
From my own history 
Those that I hurt
And those that hurt me 
I was dead for a million years 
'Fore I was born and 
I'll be dead for a million more 
After I'm gone 
So I live, to give somethin' 
That can live on

Like the warmth on the sand 
When the sun goes down 
And I'm sittin' with myself 
Nobody else is around but

[Chorus:]

Been a long, long time 
Since I been away 
Been a long, long time 
Since I felt this way 
Been a long, long time 
I found the words to say 
How much I'm grateful 
For my life today 
'Cause under every cup 
You might find a nut 
Behind every corner 
You might get jacked up 
At the end of every rainbow
You might find gold 
The last bite of your sandwich
Hope you don't find mold 
'Cause none of us 
Can live the perfect life 
The kind that we see on nick at night 
And sometimes, we all 
Just lose sight 
Of the pain that will guide us 
From dark into the light 
We fall down yes, but we get up
And sometimes we just need 
A little bit of love 
To help make it 
Through another day 
Into the night, into the light
Into a Saturday 
So in the morning when I'm waitin' 
For the sun to raise 
And my head's a little foggy 
Like I'm in a haze 
I remind myself that 
Everything is gonna be okay 
I take a breath, slow down and say...

[Chorus:]",Pray for Grace
Michael Franti,"They gotta war for oil, a war for gold
A war for money and a war for souls
A war on terror, a war on drugs
A war on kindness and a war on hugs
A war on birds and a war on bees

They gotta a war on hippies tryin' save the trees
A war with jets and a war with missiles
A war with high seated, government official
Wall street war, on high finance

A war on people who just love to dance
A war on music, a war on speech
A war on teachers and the things they teach
A war for the last 500 years

War's just messin' up the atmosphere
A war on Muslims, a war on Jews
A war on Christians and Hindus
A whole lotta people just sayin' kill them all

They gotta a war on Mumia Abu Jamal
The war on pot, is a war that?s failed
A war that's fillin' up the nations jails
World war one, two, three and four

Chemical weapons, biological war
Bush war 1, and Bush war 2
They gotta a war for me, they gotta a war for you!

[Chorus]
We can't stop it when the beat just drops!
(And we don't stop)
We can't stop it when the rebel rock!
(And we don't stop)
We can't stop until we hit those heights!
(And we don't stop)
We can't stop because we love this life!
(And we don't stop)

Dance to the new day
Sing to the new day, Rhyme to the new day
Transform hell into heaven God lives through,
Grab hold of today

Yesterday is over, tomorrow may be too late
Everything is one but the one is off balance
Music made for the dollar like soul and talent
Really ain't it all about a feeling you was havin'

As a child runnin' wild
Before the mind programmin' set in
Threatenin' your establishment
Get in this energy, lay back and sit

The next men wreckin', to the master's lips
Head spin breathren, get to askin' if
Where, when, Mr. President, ""What do you know?""
It's evident settin' in slow, ""How does it go?""

An unprecedented event is about to unfold
The devil can't stop, won't stop blockin' the globe
Fall in a cell here
Freedom come knockin' at the door

They try lockin' it though, but we about to explode
We got the firefly, tiger eye apocalypse flow
So deep in the bottom of your bottomless soul
Send mind darts flyin' out, without a pistol

Redesign lost minds got outta the cold
Bring order to a world that is outta control
""Truth"" you say, I say, ""How do I know?""

[Chorus]

I wanna rock with punks because I love punk rock
I wanna rock with heads because I love hip hop
I wanna rock my beats all around the block
If I was in Baghdad then I would rock Iraq

I wanna rock with punks because I love punk rock
I wanna rock with heads because I love hip hop
I wanna rock my beats all around the block
There is just one love so the planet we rock

New world days and new world nights
New world wrongs and new world rights
Putting new world funds in the new world banks
With the new world guns on the new world tanks

New world devils and new world gods
New world jails see the new worlds hard
New world names sing the new world songs
New world planes are the new world bombs
New world's flying, the new world's dying

The new world's crying and the new world's trying
New world sons and new world daughters
They are already selling us the new world water
New world beats for the new world to bang

New world streets for the new world to hang
New world president, new world drugs
New world resident, new world thugs
New world players for new world sports

New world trials for the new world courts
New world lawyers and new world laws
New world prisons and new world bars
New world fight the new world's fists

The new world lighting up the new world spliffs
New world smoke in the new world lungs
New world's choking, the new world's done

We don't stop.. (repeat to fade)",We Don't Stop
Michael Franti,"If I could be the sun
I'd radiate like Africa and
Smile upon the world
Intergalactic love laughter and
If I were the rains, I'd wash away the whole world's pain and
Bring the gift of cool like ice cream trucks on sunny days and
If I was the earth I'd be like mountains bountiful
And if I were the sky so high, I'd be like wind invincible and
If I could be a seed, I would give birth to redwood trees and
If I were the trees, I'd generate the freshest air to breathe in

[Chorus]
What I be, is what I be
What I be, is what I be
Well, well, well, movin on!
Well, well, well, movin on!
Do you love someone? Do you love somebody?
Love that one!

If I could be the leaves, then like jade I would stay evergreen and
Spread my limbs out wide and pull love so close to me and
If I could the roots, I would dig deep like ancestry and
If were the fruits, you'd make the sweetest cherry pie from me and
If I could be the night, my moon replace all electric lights and
Magic music would transmit from outer space on satellites
If I myself could be the ocean, you would feel emotion all the time and
If I were the words, then everything that everybody said would rhyme

[Chorus]

If I could be sex my words would protect
I'd be in the lives of all who connect
What the heck, I'd make it so we all got selected
Pores would be dripping pure hot intellect and
The minds of the masses would all stay erect and
Then just for kicks, I'd mail out some checks
Addressed to those who sent their used latex in
Yes, that's what I would if I were sex
If I could be you, you could be me
I could be you, you could be me
I could walk a mile in your shoes.....
And you could walk a mile in my bare feet

[Chorus]",What I Be
Michael Franti,"Everybody wants to be what they want to be
Everybody want to have a good time
I just want to hang out with my peaceful itty bitty family
Playing sweet, sweet music with some friends of mine

But I try to fake it, I can't do it all the time
Try hard to break it, but it was just a waste of my time
When I turn on my TV, seems like they're winning all the time.
I pray to God to please show me a sign

Has anybody seen my mind?
Has anybody seen my mind?
Has anybody seen my mind?
Has anybody seen my mind?

I would never ever leave you hanging on the corner with a problem
I would never ever leave you all alone
I always wanted you to know that you could depend on me
When I come out to your place, I will never be without a home

But I try to fake it, I can't do it all the time
Try hard to break it, but it was just a waste of my time
When I turn on my TV, seems like they're winning all the time
I pray to God to please show me a sign

Has anybody seen my mind?
Has anybody seen my mind?
Has anybody seen my mind?
Has anybody seen my mind?

I want you to walk with me now, talk with me now
Be with now, and everything is all right

Walk with me now, talk with me now
Be with now, and everything is all right
Walk with me now, talk with me now
Be with now, and everything is all right
Walk with me now, talk with me now
Be with now, and everything is all right

I try to fake it, I can't do it all the time
Try hard to break it, but it was just a waste of my time
When I turn on my TV, seems like they're winning all the time
I pray to God to please show me a sign

Has anybody seen my mind?
Has anybody seen my mind?

Michael Franti,"I'm so very happy just to be here
I'm so glad I'm finally in a psace with you
People say that we should never do this
But they don't, they don't wanna know the truth

You can try, you can try
To build a fortress in your mind
Try to stack up all your things so high
You can try, you can try
To climb away from this life
But it will only bring you closer to the sky

People say that you should never come here
Something bad is only gonna happen to you
Better stay inside where we can see you
If you don't we'll make sure that you're feeling blue

You can try, you can try
To build a fortress in your mind
Try to stack up all your things so high
You can try, you can try
To climb away from this life
But it will only bring you closer to the sky

Some people think that life is worth living for tomorrow
Some people think that life is worth living for today
Some people think that life is worth nothing but sorrow
Some people think that life is worth living day by day

Your way to me
At midnight

Burnin' flames

Incinerate
A path for me
And that is why

Michael Franti,"Heavy medicine
Ya see my eyes are feeling red again
I'm bringin' light
Like Thomas funky Edison
Been in the desert for forty seven days
Purple Haze
The poison that I tasted never changed
Turn up the woofers so I can feel the beat
Vibrate my belly like a bomb in harmony
Summer heat
My back is sticking to me to the seat
Bare feet
Tank top and shorts is all ya need but
Summer breeze
I'm feelin' kinda fine
I'm rollin with my shorty all the time
Wind and grind lovely shake your behind
Cinnamon skin be bringing sin to my mind
But whether or not the weather's hot
Or the weather's cold
I'm wrapping her like a blanket with my whole soul
So that she can feel me
Like Coca Cola I'm the woo-o-oh oh the sweet thing
My girl lollipop she growing mad crops
She rollin' herbs everyday
At about 4 o' clock
Tick tock
Strike the hammer while the Iron's hot
Ooh girl watcha got cooking in the pot
See Mary Mary quite contrary
How does your garden grow?
Hydrophonic ultra supersonic
Or does it grow naturally slow?

I love tha way ya love me and the way ya misbehavin'

Come wake my body-ody take my mind away

Just like the cover of I want you
Yoo hoo look watcha gonna do
Watcha gonna do when the rent comes due
Round up the posse and call up the crew
5 bucks at the door and ya bring ya own booze
Call ya neighbor 'cause they can come too
Be sure and bring ya records 'cause I only got a few
So baa baa black sheep have you any wool
Yes sir, yes sir a nickle bagful
Some for my partner some for my crew
Some for my ganja baby she needs 2
For just like me they long to be high

Michael Franti,"When I fall down, I need a helping hand.
And when I lose my head, it's cause it's buried in the sand.
When I get stuck on myself, feelin' sorry for myself.

When I start to lose control, when I get irrational,

Michael Franti,"I received a letter, that you wrote me, 
On a dark, cold and cloudy day. 
Reminded me on the side of the road, 
You'll find a light you'll find a friend you'll find a way. 
Well today I'm feelin' all broke down, 
I ain't got the faintest clue 'bout what to do, 
Can't comprehend the situation at hand, 
So I'll try my best just to get back home to you.

Keep on walkin' now, (yes I will,) 
Keep on takin' bout it (yes I will.) 
Keep on singin' bout it (yes I will,) 
Keep on rainin' down (yes I will.) 

Yoo hoo hoo hoo, yoo hoo hoo 
Yoo hoo hoo hoo, yoo hoo hoo 

I believe that what you sing to the clouds, 
Will rain upon you when your sun has gone away, 
And I believe that what you dream to the moon, 
Will manifest before you rest another day. 
So stay strong, and sleep long, and when you need to 
Let the morning take you out on to today, hey hey, 
And when you find you're at the end of the road, 
Just lift your head up, spread your wings and fly away, come on y'all!

But we all are talkin' at the same time
We say we want peace
But nobody wants to change there own mind
No they don't

So it goes on and on and on and on and on
For a 1000 years, a 1000 years I say
And it goes on and on and on and on and on
A language are your tears, are your tears

Everybody wants to live life of kings and queens
But nobody wants to stay in a cloud of fears
Everybody wants to tear there neighbor's hello
But nobody wants to listen to how they feel

So it goes on and on and on and on, and on
For a 1000 years, a 1000 years I say
And it goes on and on, and on, and on, and on
Well, language are your tears, are your tears

Love enough yeah? Love enough?
Can you love some more?
Is the love enough? Yeah

What Mother Nature gives
Mankind refuse to let live
Taking the universe in their own hand

Oh yes now, start targeting the deposities
Charging the negative
Causing the most unusual circumstances

Everyday we rise back
I love to fights like again
Hoping that's our hearts
Where we see sleep our love tonight

Blessed words we speak again
Of the words to do my friend
For us to live in this dark garden
Of Eden

So tell me is your love enough? Yeah
Your love enough? Yeah
Is your love enough?

Can you love some more ?
Is your love enough? Yeah
Is your love enough? Yeah
Is your love enough?
Oh tell me, tell me, tell me

What language do you laugh in?
What language do you cry in?
What language do you dance in
Make romance in

What language do you make love in?
Oh, pray to above him
What language are your fears?
What language are your tears?

Michael Franti,"A child is born, and a mama's torn 
About the life that it's bound to live 
A sun and moon and a modest home 
Is all they asking the Lord to give 
But politics and big events they never seem to notice the little guy 
So make a plan or simply hold a hand but don't ever be a passer by 

Tolerance or violence and the whole world go to war 
Is one enough or is one too many 
Before we say, ""No More"" 
Could you ever love a pot of gold? 
Could you ever love another lonely soul? 
Could you ever find a love that was oceans wide? 
Could you ever find love in another stranger's eyes? 

Oh, give a little, 
Tolerance, tolerance 
We need you more and more 
So lend a hand or simply hold a friend 
That's in need of a life support 
Draw a picture, share a whisper 
Anyway that you can rise above 
And when the end is near who is gonna volunteer 
To be the last one to die for love 

Tolerance or violence and the whole world go to war 
Is one enough or is one too many 
Before we say, ""No More""
