Radio Futura,"Un día más me quedaré sentado aquí
En la penumbra de un jardín tan extraño
Cae la tarde why me olvidé otra vez
De tomar una determinación
Esperando un eclipse
Me quedaré
Persiguiendo un enigma
Al compás de las horas
Dibujando una elipse
Me quedaré
Entre el sol why mi corazón
Junto al estanque me atrapó la ilusión
Escuchando el lenguaje de las plantas
Why he aprendido a esperar sin razón
Soy metálico en el Jardín Botánico
Con mi pensamiento sigo el movimiento
De los peces en el agua
Un día más me quedaré sentado aquí
En la penumbra de un jardín tan extraño
Cae la tarde why me olvidé otra vez
De tomar una determinación
Esperando un eclipse
Me quedaré
Persiguiendo un enigma
Al compás de las horas
Dibujando una elipse
Me quedaré
Entre el sol why mi corazón

Radio Futura,"Hace muchos, muchos años en un reino junto al mar 
Habitó una señorita cuyo nombre era Annabel Lee 
Y crecía aquella flor sin pensar en nada más 
Que en amar y ser amada, ser amada por mi. 

Éramos sólo dos niños mas tan grande nuestro amor 
Que los ángeles del cielo nos cogieron envidia 
Pues no eran tan felices, ni siquiera la mitad 
Como todo el mundo sabe, en aquel reino junto al mar. 

Por eso un viento partió de una oscura nube aquella noche 
Para helar el corazón de la hermosa Annabel lee 
Luego vino a llevársela su noble parentela 
Para enterrarla en un sepulcro en aquel reino junto al mar. 

No luce la luna sin traérmela en sueños 
Ni brilla una estrella sin que vea sus ojos 
Y así paso la noche acostado con ella 
Mi querida hermosa, mi vida, mi esposa. 

Nuestro amor era más fuerte que el amor de los mayores 
Que saben más como dicen de las cosas de la vida 
Ni los ángeles del cielo ni los demonios del mar 
Separaran jamás mi alma del alma de Annabel Lee. 

No luce la luna sin traérmela en sueños 
Ni brilla una estrella sin que vea sus ojos 
Y así paso la noche acostado con ella 
Mi querida hermosa, mi vida, mi esposa. 

En aquel sepulcro junto al mar 
En su tumba junto al mar ruidoso. 
Hace muchos, muchos años en un reino junto al mar 
Habitó una señorita cuyo nombre era Annabel Lee 
Y crecía aquella flor sin pensar en nada más 
Que en amar y ser amada, ser amada por mi",Annabel Lee
Radio Futura,"why si te vuelvo a ver pintar
un corazón de tiza en la pared
te voy a dar una paliza por haber
escrito mi nombre dentro.

Tú lo has hecho porque ayer yo te invité
cuando ibas con tu amiga de la mano;
se acababan de encender todas las luces,
era tarde why nos reímos los tres.

why si te vuelvo a ver pintar
un corazón de tiza en la pared
te voy a dar una paliza por haber
escrito mi nombre dentro.

Luego estuve esperándote en la plaza,
why las horas se marchaban sin saber qué hacer,
cuando al fin te vi venir
yo te llamé por tu nombre,
pero tú no dejaste de correr.

why si te vuelvo a ver pintar
un corazón de tiza en la pared
te voy a dar una paliza por haber
escrito mi nombre dentro.

Me parece que aquel día tú empezaste a ser mayor
me pregunto ¿Cómo te han convencido a ti?.
¿Te dijeron que jugar era un pecado
o es qué viste en el cine algún final así?

why si te vuelvo a ver pintarte los labios
why es que vas dando besitos por las paredes
why se te pone todo blanco, sí
se pone todo blanco, ei

se pone todo blanco why dime qué ves
lo pintas al derecho why lo pintas al revés
es el nombre de una artista
con su cara de revista
lo pintas primero why lo borras después
al revés dice Roma why al derecho dice amor
primero es el aroma why después la flor
pero luego todo el ramo yo te quiero, yo te amo
why me muero desespero why devoro mi sombrero.

Se llamaba Carmen, se llamaba Lola
se llamaba Juana, nunca estaba sola
se llamaba Rosarito, se llamaba Raquel
se llamaba Carlota why jugaba a la pelota
se llamaba Sofía, se llamaba Brigitte
se llamaba Rita why se hacía la bobita
se llamaba Jenna, se llamaba Marilyn
eres tú la más bonita, pastillita why a dormir.

Con olor de violeta, con olor de jazmín
si me das una peseta entrarás en el jardín
why verás todas las flores, mariposas de colores,
estrellitas en el cielo con guirnaldas en el pelo
why vapores de seda why fulgores de carmín
why te digo mi secreto que que si en un rincón te meto
why te tapo los ojos why contamos hasta diez
estás como en el cine why empezamos otra vez.

Que si te quieres venir conmigo al cine
de las sábanas blancas

porque te gusta estar escondida en lo oscuro
why es que vas dando besitos por las paredes.
why si te vuelvo a ver pintarte los labios.

why si te vuelvo a ver pintar
un corazón de tiza en la pared.

why si te vuelvo a ver pintar
un corazón de tiza en la pared...",Corazon de Tiza

In a sick, sick world
If it's the fool who believes in forgiveness,

Then I will be your emotional whore

When is the time to give into mercy 
And walk from the pain
Where is the will to yearn for out freedom 
And break the chains

How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight

Radio Nationals,"You've made it through another day
Driving past the back roads of your mind
You could have turned the other way
And break down on the sanity you've found inside you

Someone said that you are fantasy
But in the darkness
Behind your smile
You scream
Scream
Scream for the crazy ones
Scream at the things you've done
Scream at the rising sun

We bless the beautiful
Let us forgive you for your sins
These must be holy ones
How could we believe they'd let us in

Oh, once I heard that they were fantasy
But in the darkness
Behind their smiles
They scream
Scream
Scream of a broken heart
Scream as they come apart
Scream cause they never started
Scream

No pain
No sympathy
You've always been so steady at the wheel

Some friend reality
You break down on the highway
About to see it my way

Scream cause they all have sons
Scream as they point the gun at you

Scream at the bleeding heart
Scream cause the end won't start
Scream as you come apart again

Radio Racer,"She’s not much of a poet but she’s got this way with words
That keeps dragging me back to my love for romance
Despite the way it hurts
Just when I think that I’m enough
There always seems to be someone better than me
She’s bittersweet

So tell me where we’re going
And why I’m lonely
Tell me the words that you told me on the drive home
I want to know, where do we go
When the light’s not changing
Like the boy who’s waiting
I need to feel with my old heart again
So I can tell if we’re better off friends

I didn’t mean it like that
I never could understand
The loss of the love
I was chasing away
But you like it like that
Love and you back to back
Suddenly I’m in need
Of a motive in me

But they say the boy is growing weaker each day
And it shows but I know
That without you I’m just blossoming
Into the boy who loved to sing
But you, you got me in a choke

I didn’t mean it like that
I never could understand
The loss of the love
I was chasing away

Don’t say that I’m a lie

But you’ve got nothing to show for I took the fall

It's not that easy at all
When hearts get broken
It's real tears that fall
Darlin' it's sad but true
Cause the one thing I learned from you
Is how the boy don't always get the girl
Here in the real world

And tonight on the silver screen
It'll end like it should

And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",Morning Bell/Amnesiac

Oh, and half of my mistakes I've made with love on the line

Half of my mistakes I swear I should've known better
Half of my mistakes were just amongst friends
You get a little distance on it, the truth is clearer
Oh, and half of my mistakes I'd probably make 'em again

If I had it all to do over
I'm sure I'd win and lose just as much
Spend a lot less time on right and wrong
And a lot more time on love

Half of my mistakes I've made 'cause I was moving too quickly
Half of them were made 'cause my heart was moving too slow
Nobody can tell you a damn thing if you ain't listening
Oh, and half of my mistakes I've made 'cause I couldn't let go

If I had it all to do over
I'm sure I'd win and lose just as much
Spend a lot less time on right and wrong
And a lot more time on love

Half of my mistakes I'd give anything to change how it ended
Oh, and half of my mistakes God, I wouldn't change one thing
You can lean too hard on a prayer but I don't recommend it
'Cause half the good things in my life came from half of my mistakes
Yeah, a lot of good things in my life came from half of my mistakes",Half Of My Mistakes
Radney Foster,"A young man full of pride don't need much hope
He thinks he's got it made even when he don't
Thinks all he's got to do is order up a beer or two
And make work what everybody tells him won't

He don't care what all those people say
He's got to bend the world his own way
He's got dreams, he's got no doubts
You're either in or you're out
And it's better to burn than it is to fail

You wanna feel the wind, you gotta take the ride
You better dream big, you wanna touch the sky
You can't be scared to risk it all
You never gonna fly if you're afraid to fall

And old man don't waste time with regrets
He's made mistakes along the way and yet
He smiles as he's looking back
He says I'd do it all again
In fact, you learn something new 
With every single scar you get

You wanna feel the wind, you gotta take the ride
You better dream big, you wanna touch the sky
You can't be scared to risk it all
You never gonna fly if you're afraid to fall

Guess it's true that time, it really does slip away
You won't elude the chances you don't take

You wanna feel the wind, you gotta take the ride
You better dream big, you wanna touch the sky
You can't be scared to risk it all
No, you're never gonna fly if you're afraid to fall

There ain't nothin' 'bout this honky-tonk

And I can put off going back
To that ol' empty house you swore you'd never leave
From the loneliness you handed me
I can get a brief reprieve
From here until closing time
It won't matter you're gone
I can fill up my emptiness
Maybe make it on my own
From now til they lock the doors
Put the chairs up and sweep the floors
You won't even cross my mind
From here until closing time
Well the good old days are good and gone
Since you left without me
If I could figure out where we went wrong
Then maybe I'd be free
From these ties that bind my foolish heart
And just won't let me start my life again
Then I wouldn't need this lonesome bar

where a man has pulled over to figure life out
with only his concience and the lonesome sound
of diesels winding up grade
he's got a wife and two kids, and they love him so
he's got a woman down in georgia, and she's startin' to show
he's damned if he leaves her, and he's sure damned if he don't
and he wonders how life got this way
cuase it's a fine line in between right and wrong
yea he's been crossing over that border way too long
he should've seen it coming at him right from the start
now there aint' no escape from a broken heart
now the call of the highway is a powerful thing
like the pull of a lover, or a child in a swing
gave his heart to two women only one wears his ring
they're both gonna have his babies now
so how do you confess, what words don't explain
he never intended to cause this much pain
now he feels like a farmer who went praying for the rain
got more than he bargained from the clouds

Radney Foster,"Better build your house on a rock
Or watch it crumble and fail
Better build your love, hammer and nail

I see it in the darkness as if it was broad daylight
I feel it down inside my soul when I hold you tight
It takes much more than passion for love to prevail
Gotta raise it up with hammer and nails

Hammer and nail, we're gonna build this love
Faith and hope, flesh and blood
Lay that firm foundation down to the last detail
Gonna build our love with hammer and nails

You build one room for laughter, you build one room for tears
This ain't no game, no house of cards, it's gonna take us years
A vow that's only spoken comes to no avail
Put 'em in your hands, hammer and nails

Hammer and nail, we're gonna build this love
Faith and hope, flesh and blood
Lay it out so straight and true to the last detail
Gonna build our love with hammer and nails

Or was it more like ten years ago
She nailed two dozen roses to the top of his coffin
And buried'em deep where they never would grow
Lord she buried'em deep where they never would grow

Now the Irish are funny, they'll cry when they have to
And the lady she moaned such a mournful sound
Me and the Mexican just finished the bottle
And remembered the days when Old Silver was around
Yeah remembered the days when Old Silver was around

'Cause Old Silver took the best of it with him
The lovers and the dealers and the dreamers of dreams
And Old Silver took the love of a lady
Who never got over Old Silver and me
Lord she never got over Old Silver and me

Old Silver had the magic and he carried the money
With the grace of a gambler and he lost it with ease
And he knew his lines better than any good carny barker
Wore the best damn boots that you ever have seen
He had the best snake-skin boots that you ever have seen

Now the lady she loved him and she never asked questions
Though she laid awake wonderin' on many a night
She swore she was leavin' most every mornin'
But she always would kiss him when he turned out the lights
She was always right there when he turned out the lights

CHORUS

Now there's always a sidekick in every B-western
Who's always in love with a lady who leaves

It wasn't school boys and ladies it was cow-towns and sin

But that don't change the things we did

If it were me I'd be holding her in my arms

I ain't no smarter than the rest of these clowns
I'm just making it up as I go along 

I had dreams at 21 
I traded for a car 
The car is gone and the dreams are, too 
But I've still got your heart 

You always saw right through the smoke and mirrors 
Nothing fooled you for long 
You know the wizard's just a man behind the curtain shifting gears 
Still making it up as I go along. 

I've worn this mask before 'til I don't know who I am 
I love the cards life's dealt me 
But I sure don't know how to play out my hand

There are nights I've tried to escape it

Girl tell me the truth
Don't try to lie about it
Someone else has been with you
Judas couldn't hide it any better than this
The secret's out darling
Betrayed by a kiss
Well it's right here with us baby
Though it really can't be seen
It's the smell of his seduction
And it makes it hard to breathe
A tender touch can hit you so much harder than a fist
Not a single word was spoken
You've been betrayed by a kiss

And blow that candle out

Learn to fill a house with doubts
And how long have I been so blind
And been the odd man out

Baby whatever comes Monday
Can take care of itself

Cause we've got better things that we can do

A cross in Mexico
Your kiss is like the incense of a prayer nailed to the door

We've held each other through hopes and through fears

If I could just reach inside you
Hold and hide you I would baby I would

New York City down to San Antone
There's boys that are ridin' for legendary fame
And our money's all gone but we ride just the same

Our hearts got broken, and our heads get busted
But we'll always believe the things that we trust
There'll be those nights when glory comes 'round
And we'll tip our hats and wave to the crowd

Tonight gonna throw all the numbers out a window

Laid to rest in 'em like some ancient Egyptian

I can't live without the love you're giving
The only thing I know that's true
Is loving you's how I survive this world we live in

The blue ball keeps spinning
The rich folks, they keep winning
No free lunch, no, the little guy's always gotta pay
The rate race, I try to run it
The only way I overcome it is holding nothing back
Whenever you're holdin' nothing back

I won't lie to you
I would die without the love you're giving
The only thing I know that's true

Radney Foster,"He was nervous and excited when he walked in:
She poured him a drink an' they discussed the price of sin.
She had unbuttoned just two buttons,
An' put her hand upon his thigh,
An' when that grown man started cryin',
She did not blink an' eye.

She just held him in her arms like a little child,
An' she laid there an' listened to him talk for a long, long while.
He rambled on about the lawyers,
An' the family torn in two.
He said: ""Now it's like this: I'm empty;
""I'm just tryin to get through.""

An' the kindness of strangers: 
The tears of angels:
An' the wonderin' how to let go,
When the heartache's all you trust.
The quiet of cathedrals,
To cut through the evil:
There's some little ray of hope,
While you watch love turn to rust.
And your soul is bleedin',
What you really need is,
The kindness of strangers.

He put on his coat an' he headed for the door.
She said: ""You never got what you paid me for.""
She said: ""I don't need to keep this money.""
He said: ""Yeah, you do.""
An' she said: ""I don't pray much,
""But honey, I'll pray for you.""

An' the kindness of strangers: 
The kisses of angels:
An' letting go even though,
The heartache's all you trust.

The wings of eagles:
To carry you some hope,

When you really need it:
'Cause your soul is bleedin':

Walk in barrows, and digging your battles
And good whiskey has never done me wrong
I believe in pretty women
Little kids smiles and worn out denim
The way Waylon used to tear up a country song

I believe love is hard to handle
Wild and crazy, it's a long shot gamble
If you're gonna win, gotta play your cards right
I believe love is coming to me
Faster than the way that you're looking right through me
Judging from the way I feel tonight
I believe you just might prove me right

I probably oughta do a little less talking
Go to bark and laugh more often
And pray harder when nothin' else will do
I belong in honky tonk bar-rooms
Singing songs bout things I've gone through
Wrapped in arms of somebody like you

Play it over the pit and dig up more of that green shit,
And trade it with the Russians, who are traditionally hated,
You can imagine that after a few years
That you'd run out of things to say,
And I'll be here every day.

On a transformer four stories high it walks like a cripple
And turns on its base,

A creature from a creation that's from outer space.
Sixty foot high for miles around;
One million tons of Phospho~Gypsum tailings rise to the sky.
Nearly half the world's fertilizer once lay beneath the overburden;
It got taken off this sandbar,
And now there's something that's left behind.
Hey, this place is a mess!

I'll clean it up later.
No, that's not the way it is at all, I'm not a miner I don't care,
Man, that's pant of the system, I'm punk,
But who's gonna indict the Wall Street Journal, just me and Bob Ray,
It's just part of the system here on the surface of the planet
And the day has come when there's only work left
There's unlimited sunshine in a bottle of Tropicana,
With his friends and his 'Spooky Tooth' 8-track flipped upside down,
Drivin' in his Mercury Monterey down to Lithia Springs,

I want you to listen to me for a little bit right here 
I wanted you to read the newspapers this morning 

Or did you see the evening news 
As you were having dinner with your families last night? 
Well, if you did then you must know that 
This world is now in a whole lot of trouble 

But I don't want you to get discouraged by that, no 
Because I believe that there's a solution to all of this 
Deep down within my soul 
All we have to do is put are heads and hearts together 

You gotta wake up everybody and no more sleeping in bed 
And no more backward thinking, it's time for thinking, ahead 
The world's changed so very much from what it used to be 
There's so much hatred, war and poverty, oh yeah

Wake up all you teachers, you better teach a new way 
Maybe then they'll listen to what you have to say 

Because they are the ones 
Who's coming up and the world is in their hands 
When you teach the children 
You better teach them the very best you can 

The world won't get no better 
If you just let it be, no no 
The world won't get no better 
You gotta change again, you and me 

Wake up all you doctors, make the old people well 
Because they're the ones who suffer a lot and catch all the hell 
They don't hassle very long before their judgment day 
Won't you make them happy before they pass away? 

Wake up all you builders, it's time to build a new land 
I know we can do it if we all lend a hand 
Only thing we have to do is put it in our minds 
And surely things will work out, they do it every time 

The world won't get no better, oh no 
If we just let it be

And when your swollen heart, teased, fickle n' insane

But as you can see the bad bitches love it
They ain't let us in the building back then
Now our names on the flyer if we coming

Yo, check what happened out of state

I smoke the black dust kept my hands clutched, I'm fallin' in lust
Spore plush I played my hand like a royal flush
Baggy jeans, wallabee clarks, pretty woman
I put it in him, shot up in him, deadly venom
I hung around the big time bosses
Illegal force exchange thoughts, showing love to all my sources
Spades tried to bag me, like Cagney, and Lacey
Chef had that bitch stacey slippin in Macy's
I dose off, catch a flashback on how I got trapped
And got licked like papsy in a mob flick I got hit
Stumblin holdin my neck to the god's rest
Opened flesh burgundy blood colored my guess
Emergency trauma, black teen headed for surgery
Can it be an out of state nigga tried to murder me?
I should've stayed in job corp, but now I'm a outlaw
Ray cartegna, carry a fo'-fo' nigga

Can it be that it was all so simple then?
Dedicated to the gods and earths
Dedicated to babies who came feet first
Dedicated to up north and down state
Dedicated to rich niggaz who sell weights
Dedicated to projects with black kids
Dedicated to man who build pyramids

I think it's time to bless them, word up
Bulletproof
First chamber
Yo chef yo

It started off on the island, ak shaolin niggaz wildin
Old folks scream : stop the violence!
True layin up yo, watchin these crack niggaz
Playin nuff crap games for what see?
Back in days, crime pays in mad ways
Sportin tommy hil with caves 360 waves
And no searchin for loose ends, now flex 300 benz
Mad 10's with mad diamonds
Now that's the life of the good life, sometimes niggaz act trife
I paid the price throughout my hood life
Remember I got blasted, now that's in the past kid
God forbid I lay in the casket
But now I'm all about g-notes, no time for weed, mixed with coke
I wash my mouth out with soap
And I got my act together, 'lo sweaters and better
And fat leather, so whatever, bring it on

Can it be that it was all so simple then?",Can It Be All So Simple [Remix]
Raekwon,"Yo, first of all son, peep the arson
Many brothers I be sparkin' and bustin' mad light inside the dark
Call me dough snatcher, just the brother for the rapture
I hand glide, holdin' on strong, hard to capture
Extravagant, RZA bake the track and it's militant
Then I react, like a convict, and start killin' shit
It's manifested, the Gods work like appliances
Dealin' in my cypher I revolve around sciences
The 9th chamber, leave you trapped inside my hallway
You try to flee but you got smoked up by the doorway (blaow! blaow! blaow!)
No question, I send your ass back, right to the essence
Your whole frame is smothered in dirt, now how you restin'
While I'll be trapped by sounds, locked behind loops
Throwin' niggas off airplanes cause Cash Rules
Everything Around Me black, as you can see
Swallow this murder one verse like God Degree
Then analyze my soundtrack for satisfaction
You adapt like a flashback chain reaction

Lace 'em niggas, son
AK's black bust back like seventy Macs
I'm all that, street niggas knowin my steez black
Ron G, you know he coincide with me see
Marvelous, Menace fo' Society
But anyway, let's toast, champagne thoughts with Ghost
I max the most shotguns through the nose
Fuck rap, hip hop put me on top
'Lo wears, and Tommy Hil fly shit with a knot
The witty unpredictable live shit, drive by shit
Do or die shit, I'll take your lie and shit
And then you know, I'm runnin' through the penal, foul
Four-toothed child was wild
The old lady snitched, but fuck it, you know it, one love kid
No I'm not doin a bid
Too much to get for what cause six niggas got
Stuck, and the nigga chain was truck
Yo fuck that, Criminology rap
Speakers stay jet black floatin' in the flyest Ac'
Nigga, bring it! Yeah",Criminology
Raekwon,"Yeah
Yo son you gotta take me to get them Clarks, man
Yo, check it out, yo

Yo I got a crazy idea how to do Clarks now
Check it out, boom, this is how you freak 'em, boom
You go get you go get the cream joints right? Boom
Now now, all you all you dye, is this shit right here, boom
And this, you know what I'm saying? Any color you want
But it'd be like, blue and cream, you know what I'm saying?
Shit like that, niggas don't even know
But son word is bond I'mma rock niggas this summer
On the real, know what I'm saying?
Yo son, I had crazy visions
Check it out check it out check it out, boom
Just imagine if you buy, woo! Check it out
Just imagine you bought navy blue, right
A navy blue, a navy blue pair right, boom
Of this, of this shit, know what I'm saying?
But dyed get this dyed cream on top
Just imagine that color like
But you got it dripping like it's marble cake like...

Stand on the block, Reebok, gun cocked
Avalanche rock get paid off mass murderous services
Chef break 'em, watch the alley cats bake 'em
Four-nine made 'em, drop grenades and take 'em
Quick fast we reflect like the sky be blue true
Wu-Tang saga continue
Rap Meyer Lansky crash your fantasy
Getting high fellas stand by, here's the plan, see
Sit back collecting Tecs and checks and
Blowing slow in a Montero flexing
Beats break heavily word to INS bless me
Blow me like three bags of cess
For real from the Killa Hill locked and caged in
We're sworn representatives, reacting like made men
Strive for wives, nine lives and lies
Max sell and enjoy the highs, what

The treasure is the glaciers of ice, orginal man
Possess the power to hold G's guns and grams
Baker baker, pull off a keystone caper
Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd and watch me scrape her

Proceed with caution as you enter the symphony
Degrees of punishment increase intensely
Syndrome was caused by the deadly drums
But the battle was won by swords being swung
Slicing with a vocal, from the international vocalist
Your style is too local to fuck with this
Offensive antagonist
No assistance, moving motionless
Mysterious swiftness
Thoughts roll down the shaft of the brain
Mental gives the signal to the physical
Whirlwind kicks and hits from every angle
Violent temperaments, left continents dented
Poison vintage wine rhymes I invented
Drunk by the drunken punches that punctures the heart
Vital sparks from the arteries start

The treasure is the glaciers of ice, orginal man
Possess the power to hold G's guns and grams

Straight up and down it's all good
Peace to them check cashing, chain snatching, gun flashing
Niggas in the hoods bubbling good
Analyze Starks, who be buying lion heads and Clarks
To all my house bitches, Starks'll be home soon
I'm on tour chill, catch me '96 in June
But until then my ten-man team be safe
Chill on the whips for seven months, we can all get laced
Take a boat cruise, sip daquiris and max
Swimming pools, fly jewels, Wally shoes, blow stacks
Relax kids, black kids got a craving for Cris
Until we get back and pack, leave the Mac with your Wis'
But whatever, I gotta hit other sides of the Earth
Spread Wu-ness, rule this, civilization's cursed
But luckily I'm born to be wild and aure-al
Move crowds collect twenty thou and then be out
Heavy convoys my crew keep pretty boys paranoid
Blow like a steroid pat down Dan Aykroyd
My seeds, run with his seeds, marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family

The treasure is the glaciers of ice, orginal man
Possess the power to hold G's guns and grams
Baker baker, pull off a keystone caper
Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd and watch me scrape her

My seeds, run with his seeds, marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family

It's been a long time since the father left in '69
It's been a long time since Wu Tang had the chance to shine
It's been a long time since we had diamonds, gold and drink Cristal wine
It's been a long time of walking around here dumb, deaf, and blind
It's been a long time since you had the Son of Man chant like golden wine
It's been a long time",Glaciers of Ice
Raekwon,"Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin
The special technique of shadowboxing

Poisonous, poisonous (word word word)
I should slap all y'all niggaz for coming in my fuckin face with that shit
Alright cool yeah, go ahead man
Poisonous

Poisonous paragraphs, smash ya phonograph
In half, it be the Inspectah Deck on the warpath
First class leavin mics with a cast
Causin ruckus like the aftermath when guns blast
Run fast, here comes the verbal assaulta
Rhymes runnin wild like a child in a walker
I scored from the inner slums abroad
And my thoughts are razor sharp I sliced the mic from the cord
First they criticize, but now they have become
Mentally paralyzed with hits that I devise
Now I testify, the rest is i, rebel ins
Ya highness, blessed to electrify
With voltage of an eel, truth that I reveal'll
Crush the amateurs who screamed to keep it real
Caesar black down hoodied up and fatigues
Part time minor leagues receive third degrees
Attack like a wolf pack, once I pull back
Then guard you, and bust through like a fullback

Yo, you fourteen carat gold slum computer wizard
Tappin inside my rap vein causes blizzards
Do I like the kills for ice trife like botta digits
Gorillas injected with strength of eighty midgets
The earth spins ruins, rap exotic blends
Let my peeps in, niggaz gaspin swallowin aspirins
What a dosage, you overdosed in rap
High explosives my post-its hypnotize with hypnosis
I sell goods, my whole clan is on the run like natural born killers
Record-breaking the album thriller
Now access the jig who has bombs and rocket launchers
Float like dope killer bees is what I sponsor
Ya entrepreneur, pens and gear like Shakespeare
When I fuck I grab hair, collect drawers as souvenirs
Fuck yeah, my crew down German beers
My career is based on guns, throwin cats in wheelchairs
Etcetera, damage any lame ass competitor
Who try to front, get broken and passed like leathers
Whatever hot hardheads get shattered like mirrors
Beretta shots splatter your goose, scatter ya feathers
Say never poetry chumps crumbs deal with graphic
Blew my family overseas in mansions
If rap was crack, fully packed I be tour cats
Tax the kingpin of the rap drug traffickin
Village niggaz get slapped in manhattan
For rappin, big ghost steps off laffin

(Were you just using the wu-tang school method against me?
I've learned so many styles, forgive me)

Sit back relax, fake niggaz don't get turns
Watch me massage ya brain with slang that's king
Projects filled with young men cause threats
Who is that? thousand dollar chains and techs
Focus, the brokest niggaz of life shit
These mics is like cocaine sun, check the suicidal hype shit
Exchange mad blunts taste the sweepstakes
Keepin up on fakes outta state for cakes
No doubt, plus nobody amount, we making dough off of
Puttin fifty on the land and allah, it's like that
Pull ya shoes up black, matta of fact just adapt
Tie up, ya black nike's and tight hats
Corners, stay surrounded with foreigners
Whattup dread? feds caught you grudgin for his bread
But regardless, peace to jail niggaz with charges
Unify layin in the guard with la
My clan done ran from japan to Atlanta, with stamina
Clingers and gamblers, and gram handlers
Tical like the isle, so god, let's get steamed
Infrared guard yo' beem, so seek nuff respect
Rude bwoy you bet, keep it movin par shallah
Pro black like tar
Designin the fly shit and stay shinin and
The rza pours more beats than cristal's fine wine
Concrete raps go to black
With 50 other niggaz on the other side of the map
Knew it's all good and all done what, we want some
Mike Tyson of this rap shit, pullin out macs for fun

The nigga don't get mad, I got mad styles of my own
And it's shown when my hands grip the chrome microphone
Verbally I catch bodies with cordless shotties
Intriguin emcees, I keep em trained like potties
I bomb facts, my sword is an axe
To split backs invisible, like dope fiend tracks
Sky's the limit, niggaz are timid, and nobody knows
How we move like wolfs in sheep clothes
Producin data, microchips or software

Mafia flicks, tyin up tricks was his main hobby
Teachin his seed, Wu-Tang karate
Mixin drinks in clubs, hairy chest with many minks
Night time rollin' with spics
Extra live, he claimed he couldn't die, top rank
Took sixteen shots in his fist to bank
And his pet piranha, he named him marijuana
Smokin' ganja, callin' his weed paisandra
Claimin New York was ancient Babylon
Where the sky stayed the color of grey, like her-on
I can't front though, truck loads of indo

Don't laugh, bag the cash, grab the hash, don't forget his stash
Grab the tear gas, and place it in his face fast
The full blast

Bagged up by the gates, in crates like disco breaks
Yo look out for Jakes, give it all it takes
Let's burn the place before we motivate
Yo Blake, niggaz don't fink, rape his mate
If the bitch scream, for God's sake, grab the grey tape
It's by the plate, with the blow crushed up with the flakes
Killer snakes, four bodies found floatin in lakes
Drug related, paper talkin bout the kids who didn't make it
Hits without a trace, never seen the Big see Rae and Ghostface
Congratulations Chef, let's celebrate and sip an eighth

The rap scar is on rap chrome
Put it on seal it on, we're silicone
Spark it on your Talkathon
This rap phenomenon, to word is bond to the arms
Hit me on the hip and horns, rap chaperone
Scars tone, bar clones, war tones, raw tones
Blowin out the door, bones but
Your rap's fraudulent, float in these rap quarter inches
Reinforced with suspense, be on your rap sword defense
These microphone professional, sensational
Fully operational, I got NIGGAZ here to play with you
You know the steez you know my whole program
Brothers from the No-Lands, all we want is the G's
Guns and grams, livin fat like the Hoffa
Mafia, sippin eatin pastas
Layin in the house tellin the seeds about the sagas
Before we got Germanic and thoughts got sporadic
We grabbed golden tablets and quick guarded the Abbots
Slugs hit the belly put tones into the telly
Sucker tried to knock me out the box like skelly
I smoke the weed dreams I drop top two degrees
Honeydips spendin G's on nails and hair weave
The crime boss, takin no loss, excessive force
We can play the A-Train, back of the iron horse",Knuckleheadz
Raekwon,"You know God, I just been, youknowhatI'msayin?
Doin my regular thing man
So I'ma get back up with you though baby

Yo man, you gotta understand, this shit is real though man

(We've got the powers to resurrect the dead)
Whassup baby? God damn, look at you man
Damn God, I got a shit out you man

A little weed-hopper running around here man
Look at you baby, you look good
(We've got the powers to resurrect the dead)
Understand, I watched you go through a lot of trials and tribulations
But you know something, like I used to always tell you baby
A good listener's a good learner
(G-O-D's my reality)
I see you listened VERY well, understand?
(I'm elevating strong and I'm gonna go on to the highest degree)
Your time is coming baby
See sometime, it could be like, a rear view
YouknowhatI'msayin? And people don't know when their blessing comes
But I watch you grow, man you is a very intelligent man
Man, I watched you when I used to sit down and you would
trick me out my money shootin dice, niggaz is you crazy?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
(G-O-D's my reality)
Crazy you crazy man
Yo Rae, you remember that shit man?
When we used to be down there in the hills and shit man?
(I'm elevating strong I'm gonna go on to the highest degree)
And you'd catch it, from Old Man Freed
He'd be yelling ""You little slick ass""
Ha ha ha ha
Talk to me baby, knowhatI'msayin?
Ha ha ha ha
I've been through all them things, man I'm watchin you growin
But remember one thing Rae like I used to tell you
The child you was is making you the man you is today
And if you don't know where you came from baby
You DAMN sure know that you don't know where you going
Can you see what I'm saying?
Know which way you travelling
(We've got the powers to resurrect the dead)
You understand? And follow that destiny, follow the light
And it'll set you free
(Ohh, G-O-D's my reality)
Cause I've watched you baby
You my main man
Yeah
(We're elevating strong and we're going on to the highest degree)

Now that could be the Wu-Tang production
Start to knuckle up and, gun shots start to click the block's duckin
Could it be, and would it be, that we was babies
Catchin, rabies, niggaz seem to act crazy
Day one, in my spot July the tenth
I had a mint, stickin up Devines hittin them with nines
I was toxie, from layin up in Roxie's all night
This nigga bust a shot, lick my man's wife
It was havoc I contact the Abbot
He shook the shoulder though, then he passed the phat chrome automatic
We goin to war, you know we headed to the floor
He woulda, did it, for me fuck it, let's mosie
Schemin dough, with the P.L.O., wrapped on tight
Sayin in my mic ""Yo we gotta go""
My first impression was to add some lessons
Question, one, what made you even show your gun and blow the session?
He replied and rocked the green eye
And yo, he started, yellin ""Them niggaz sellin two for fives!""
But he's a goner and I got my corner
What, I'm feedin my babies, Cash Rules for mortal daughters

Yeah, Rae baby
Feedin my babies, Cash Rules for mortal daughters
Only God is the son of man
(We've got the powers to ressurrect the dead)
I'll say it one time, and be ceratin that fake God does not exist
(Ohh, G-O-D's my reality)
(I'm elevating strong we're gonna go on to the highest degree)
This is why the universe, has itself balanced the scale
of devine knowledge, and it was measured by the portion
of solid knowledge
No man, can judge for another
But each man must weigh all facts and circumstances
And find truth in his own judgment of righteousness
See, the way to evil, balance equality in no man
For no man is good and bad at the same time
Either you good, or you bad",North Star (Jewels) [*]
Raekwon,"It's a mystery inside
Of how I'm gonna get mine
I'm thinking 'bout so many ways
Of how to conquer these rainy days

It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane

The war is on, yo
On rainy days I sit back and count ways on
How to get rich son, show and prove, ask my bitch
Stood up late nights, build with my a-alikes
We can pull a heist, snatch ice, or rock mics
But this rap shit, got me wanna clack back the latch
How it goes Leon, pesos made from scratch
But in due time, soon to get mine like Bugsy
Heavy on the wrist, Polo mock socks and rugbies
Old flicks remind me of Gucci's
Back in Union Square when little Mack's milk, blast the year
That was Bill Bill, fast forward, ninety-four
Who got the bad base? Filthiest fiends scream for more
Bless me out of state, howdy Jake's, Starks is back
Niggas want work, now I pull back off a G-Pack
Coke rocks flood the co-ops living gossip
Them big lip niggas singing to cops need to box it
Stop it, the projects overflooded with slow leaks
The fiends get, new faces get wrapped in sheets
I gotta get mine, like my old Earth, bless the cheese blind
Sipping on fine wine, the power of the blacks refined
(Raining) Divine
Waiting on these royalties takes too long
It's like waiting on babies, it makes me want to slay these
But that's ungodly, so yo God, pardon me
I need it real quick, the dope flow like penmanship
Meat heads get pistol-whipped, I blow spots like horse shit
So now talk shit nigga, what??

It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane

What brings rain hail snow and earthquakes
The beat breaks, cause all my niggas to break son
Styles is similar to criminals locked up
With gats, ghetto tabernacles is fucked up
I live once though, the mind stays infinite
Traveling to touch nine planets, in my midst
While I carry, to earn a decent salary
Soon get married, raise a family, but the plan'll be
Real great, to sit up in the loft, count stacks and max
And real cats cold watch my back
But listen to the Wu son, and maintain
It's all real, starving individuals kill
I puff what's only right, leave the poison alone
Projects, infested with rats cats and crack homes
Half of us'll try to make it, the other half'll try to take it
So many fake half real freedom-ville
Born to science my alliance analyzes
Wild surprises, keeping my eyes wide to this
The unfortunate, laying in mountains counting
With jewelry on, can it be the next team house the horn
Chill dun, just for real ones, light the lye up
I hate to have to tie the next guy up
Pay attention to 1010 WINS, Wu blends
Now I'm steering you to truth, buckle up
Now who's a legend?

It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane

Word up dun
Peace to Philly, VA, these days
Word up y'all, word up
The sun moon and stars fly cars, word up y'all

No sunlight, more gun fights
I've lost him to the street life, street life
No cash flow, no more dough
He's someone I don't even know, someone I don't know
Rainy Dayz, getting through those rainy dayz
I lost him to the street life, the street life, whoa",Rainy Dayz
Raekwon,"Yo! Can you feel me?
Storytelling rap Magellan I ain't telling
Them niggas ran in the spot for selling
Word up, pushed up, man got mushed up
Seen him at a rap show acting like fat cat though
Glasses gold, shining like a real big boy
This nigga had mega ice on Chips Ahoy!
Cats surrounded, this political brown kid
All out the wind yo, my man walked in
Pulling mints out son had mad clientele
Order me Cristal twice Kion, chill!
Watch them niggas, a-yo that clique's from outta state
They bubble weight in Far Rockaway with Blake Carrington
You know the kid with the most dough getters
And terrors on fat shit clique they rock Lo sweaters
That's my man, that's my man too
Call him up on the strength of the Wu
And watch me gain duke
Grab the cell, I got a heist to pull off well
At the end of the week, I'm buying you a L
Lexus nigga, I ain't talking bout Hancock
No time for weed plus no time to get locked
That night, up in the staircase
Cousin had me laced out, skeed all outta my face
We gon' get dat crunchy chump for all of his lump
Don't try to front, you was sweating this Hilfidiger
Guess who walked in having it, his man from Farragut
Confront him with the Ruger on his back, walk in black
Where's your man, where's the sky blue Land at?
Stop playing Wu in the back, smacked him wit the gat
(Yo, money said he be here in fifteen!)
He's not lying, wait for the Millenia green to pull up
He got the Donna Karan shit on, two rings
Six carats a piece plus the chain swings
Like anchors on ships flooded with all diamond chips
Back pockets: two clips - four-fifths wit rubber grips
Laying, two bottles of brass I was slaying
Meditating, red dot be waiting for my payment
Heard the key in the lock, cocked the Glock
Turn the lights out, dip behind the couch
Kion, gag his mouth
Infra-red at his head when he entered
Butter soft Perry Ellis leather with Dorinda
A friend of, Kion's wife, Kenya, the bitch larger than life
Yo, shorty be fucking mad Columbian niggas
Fuck it, get on the floor meet the black Lex Luthor
Strip fast, the bitch had on Claiborne drawers
Yo Rae I'm about to scrape her, chill Ghost
Thought for a second, turned around
Threw the nine in his meatloaf
Yo, where's the cash and the stash that's mixed?
I don't know!
Shot his hand, he started screaming like a bitch!",Spot Rusherz
Raekwon,"Yeah yeah I'm tired of doing this shit

Let's do it then",Striving for Perfection
Raekwon,"Through the lights cameras and action, glamour glitters and gold
I unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe
When I'm deceased, by then the beast arise like yeast
To conquer peace leaving savages to roam in the streets
Live on the run, police paying me to give in my gun
Trick my wisdom with the system that imprisoned my son
Smoke a gold leaf I hold heat, nonchalantly
I'm raunchy, the things I do is real it never haunts me
While, funny style niggas roll in the pile
Rooster heads profile on a bus to Riker's Isle
Holding weed inside they pussy with they minds on the pretty things in life
Props is a true thug's wife
It's like a cycle, niggas come home, some'll go in
Do a bullet, come back, do the same shit again
From the womb to the tomb, presume the unpredictable
Guns salute life, rapidly, that's the ritual

Perhaps bullets bust niggas discuss mad money
True lies and white guys, we can see it through the eyes
Catch the most on tape, kilos disintegrate
Pyrex pots, we break, fiends licking plates
In the building niggas building, like little children, staring
Them older niggas ain't caring
Sirens circling fiends are lurking in your baggage
Oh, one's gone now, what, smack him in his cabbage
In the woodwork, crack sales bubble like Woolworth's
In the projects, richest niggas rocking all the real worth
Police questioning, rooftop cats invested in
Trading in they Lexuses, GS's, sending messages
Two and two makes four, Cristal's crazily pour
Gun wars my crew feel 'em like swords

With the green leathers, hundred pound snakes and cakes
Fiends found in lakes, jealously Jakes we shake
What I strive for is what I live for
Infatuated by material things in this wild life of war
Like somewhere over the rainbow, I see a big pot of gold
Future stacks so I hold
Thousands of cracks bagged up inside the shoebox
Don't keep jack in my lab, don't wanna see 2Pac
Got two spots, a new lot, flooded with rocks
Shoot-outs making me hot, crooked cops Bad Tony and the ball drop
In the 'nile, I'm banging niggas for slot time
Hurry up duke I'm next on line
And what the fuck is you looking at?
By the way young blood, hit me off with that Green Bay hat
Watch your back inside the hall, new niggas slide through
Like doors yo, you're staring in the mess hall
Your adrenaline runs, cigarette niggas be swindling
New jacks surrendering, come home not remembering
Made bail with different size kicks on, a white dress shirt
Looking gay in the yard, and you got hurt
Flashbacks, of the day room, mop wringer style
Your faggot ass got bashed trying to turn the dial
You told your boo you was wiling
Once you heard Wu, out of the blue, your family's from Shaolin
High class cooks, throw on vests out of phone books
Infirmary niggas are screaming, ""I got juxed!""
Sharpened toothbrushes, 190 mixed with baby oil and shit
Your man's in the kitchen stashing ice picks
Well I'ma end this with a big red cherry on top
Me, Nas and Rae got the best product on the block",Verbal Intercourse
Raekwon,"No man all bitches are the same, just like my hoes, you know
I keep em broke
Wake up one morning with some money they're subject to go crazy you know?
I keep em lookin good, pretty and all that
You know, but no dough
When I get a bitch, I got a bitch (right on)

Word up, that motherfuckin brother wise
YouknowhatI'msayin?  Teachin the uncivilized
Yeah, runnin the streets, know it's deep
Word up, check his technique, yeah
I be Ghostface
Flippin the, marvelous track
Yeah
You know the steelo, but yo, yo
Check the bangin sounds that I invent
Fake niggaz who tried to flex hard came and went
They couldn't match up with the fly nigga
Wit his back against the wall
Heads clapped once I came in the door
I played the speaker, sippin on Kahlua
Saw this bad bitch wit a switch
And yo, I had to step to her in a manner
and rather wished the current was warm
When I had reached her, I looked and knew the shit was on
Peace, excuse me, allow to introduce myself
Yo, I'm the man, and Honey, you've been rated top shelf
Yo, what's your name hon, hair wrapped up in a bun
Your eyes sparkle, just like glass in the sun
Never diss em, it's hard for a nigga just to miss em
Especially, when you're browsin, goin fishin
Your wasteline, bangin like a bassline
Physical form is well complexed
And yo, I love your outline, Boo
Your whole body is wild, wit your rugged profile
Enough to make a hard rock smile
You can't strikeout, tell me what can really go wrong
You rockin' labels - Tommy Hil down to Claiborne
Show me some love hon, show me some love boo
Show me the vibe and I'll be more than glad to shoot it through
Aiyyo peep it, I know you love Victoria's Secret
And lovin' all the marvelous slang on how I freak it
Plus, see you're the type to make a nigga crash
Far from trash, your flesh is way softer than a baby's ass
Your body lotion is the potion, the shit got me open like dust
And yo, your stee is high potent, yo
We can go the distance, I put you under wings
From this convo we can spark and see whatever brings
I walked a hot Arabian desert, barefooted
I grabbed your hand, you grabbed my joint and knew where to put it
Word up, yo, straight up and down yo
Check the joint, baby
It be the Wu-Tang production
Yeah, yeah, and all types of shit
And brothas catchin repercussions
Yo, straight up",Wisdom Body
Raekwon,"Who come to get you
None, they want guns
I be the first to set off shit, last to run
Wu roll together as one
I call my brother Sun cause he shine like one

Scriptures hit the body like sawed-off shotties
Like my hair knotty and my nosepiece snotty
Fuck a nigga hottie, that whole pussy probably
Burn like the deserts of Mugabe, for real
Ain't nothing fraudulent here, we pioneer
Commandeer a new frontier, this be the Wu yeah
Thirty-six chambers of fear, huh you lost it
Information leaking out your faucets, hmm
Time to forfeit your crown and leave the grounds
There's a new sheriff in town holding it down
It's the two holster, shit shot smoker
Wanted dead or alive, bounty on the poster
Wild in the West, a student of my culture
And life is the test, hold up
Let a nigga catch his breath
I'm still paying dues and the last one is death
Back to the essence with that shit you stressing, this rap profession
Now peep Tical, the son of the Shaolin Isle
Bless my style, criminology pays
The last times and days, Johnny fucking Blaze

This goes for niggas who know
Wu will blow like yayo, lay low
Plus cooling in Barbados
Ricans be giving me much shit to touch shit
Stay cool Papa, see you with enough shit
Back at the lab a, crack's bagged up
Yo niggas act up, what blow up their workers if they have to
Señoritas, fucking up a storm buying Gods margaritas
Sucking his dick, up in the whip long
Designed for rhyme crime nigga jail time jiggas
Them niggas up in hype Vigors lighting niggas
Silks Wally wear Figaro chain yeah
Jakes beware of black rap millionaires
Rock Airs, leather goose, bears blowing this year
1-800-GAMBINO niggas, yeah

Wu roll together as one, I call my brother Sun cause he shine like one

Solid gold crown is shining, we're blinding like some diamonds
I'm reclining in the sky on a cloud with silver lining
Double breasted, bullet proof vested, well protected
The heart, the rib cage, the chest and solar plexus
Casting stones, cracking two-hundred and six bones
And watch your ass get blown to a sea of fire and brimstone
How dare you approach it with them poems
The overfiend like noah bean green souls with a soldier mean
The grand exquisite imperial wizard or is it
The Rzarector come to pay your ass a visit
Local bio-chemical, universal giant, the black general
Licking shots at Davy Crockett on the bicentennial
Happy Millennium two thousand microchips two shots of penicillin
Goes up your adrenalin son it's time for bouting
It's a model you're resembling the niggas who like following
Trapped inside your projects like a genie inside the bottle and

God stepping forth upon holy down of the track
It's the sound that surrounds and hurts me like I'm under attack
So I decided to bite down on the mic
So the pain of the track won't deny the fact that I'm the master
For what lurks, is an expert that hurts
The individual who tries to visualize under
Cause I strike, like thunder
Niggas couldn't stand my heat, it's unbearable
My wisdom fucks up your respiratorial
Systems are fractured by the killer tactics
Style is ragged and thoughts are mad jagged
Enter the entity, my vicinity
Is three hundred and sixty degrees of humidity
Represent the school of hard knocks and Glocks my
Clan is hostile and got mad moss for blocks so
Feel the force of impact from the iron side of
The gat as I attack the track
From the blind side of the pack, Starks pass the chrome
Watch a nigga get blown out his motherfucking dome-piece
Deceased, laid to rest

Who come to get you
None, they want guns
I be the first to set off shit, last to run
Wu roll together as one
I call my brother Sun cause he shine like one

Yo, aiyyo I got to serve them my way, move give me room
Holding up your saloon, clean sweep, like a broom
Full moons make me howl like a wolf out of breath
Sold only new vocal cords you heard Genius on Gef
So step back, to the lab at, high velocity
My teammate, enhance cells more like a pharmacy
Fuck Geraldo, Pablo's plan bro is Bravo
Goodfellas we know, best sellers become novels
The man rocking head bands, silk scarves and jams
Early 80's British Walkers, playboys, mocks and shams
The laser beam vocalist does well at symphonies
Bad days, watch me snatch ice right outta Tiffany's
Remember them kids that came off with eight million
Robbed the Brinks and I labelled in royal pavilions
Them flower heads must have been stupid
Tell me how the fuck black niggas get caught with all that loot kid
There's jet money, underground money
Submarines and rings too bad you fucked up dummies",Wu-Gambinos

Selling these cakes in slabs like Lanolakes
Fiends beaming, steaming
Associated wit' names and demons
All apparent reasons
We live here the gate blew in a year 
Sorta like time share where crime
Sport it like I shine yeah,
Rainbow dough was the emmo
So many flavours yo, 
Buy your neighbour off underwater vault
Then I met him, Colombian name Flako
Had the whole block locked selling tons in Morocco
Wristwatch Fachera Costanti, nigga dead up
Sniff the rawest mist mixed wit 7up
Had a black wiz spoke German
Higher learning burning 
Ask Vernon got a bed set bought a black jet
Bitch large percentage on her rich motor lodge
Lost her arm, shot wid a AK up in the south
Paramedics rocked her, 
Said she had connections out Anartica
Barrels of juices from Florida
Can't forget live dusthead centerfoldin
Out in Club Med butt ass layin' like she dead
Wise guys fell for her ambiance
Pull it together, black renassaince 
Queen Elizabeth aunt
Crazy swift Cristal murderer
Guzzle the shit like she dying kid
Showing off her diamond 
Flashbacks now it's me and him again
Last word I caught 
'Put your money in we could have the shit bumpin'
That's federalo music
I caught the glimpse from the bitch 
When she winched yeah Santa a grinch
She blinked twitched her nose then froze
Check your Rolls by the blow
It's time to roll nigga let's go
I thought about it 
Broke the money down
What's the total count it,
No count it over in the mix
Day going slower,
Nope not time to motor
He estimated over me not being a crook
Count it over
Yo only on the strength of my man
We ain't hit him wid the strong hand
Gun him down leave him out in flatlands
He backhand smacked her
Threw her on the table jacked her
I broke out in laughter fifteen minutes after
Police knocked on the door
Looked out the window of my room
As your, nigga yeah that's yours
He opened up the door this nigga wildin'
His bitch is in shock
Start smiling and speaking on Valen
Yo wisen up bitch this from the rich
Immobilize the game get your name right
Envelope came hype
Regards from the mayor you hype
Fuck right, lets fuck this money up
And get large and blow outta sight

Just rocked another wig yeah we on it
God had blood on his sweat pants

The way the tech dance
On a nigga face
Son ain't have a chance
Seen him high pitch yellow nigga

From outta town a young mellow ally
Trying to run through
Hell and song called the dogs to get on him
When we caught him the only famous nigga

Was a lord in his forum
Bum nigga fresh outta jail
I used to play baseball wid him
'Til he got large son bought a whale

As you're by the entrance
Guess it's real nigga night out
He moving on his own negligence
Yo Lexxy strap up meet you in the back

In the Acura spectacular big key stackeler
Seen a nigga gymed down fresh haircut
Trying to swim now
Aqua green Avias on brim style wild

We walked by eyeing I'm
Shorty ain't looked
He trying to get fly

Standing by the incinerator

Thank God he your generator
I can tell bought his lady swade gators
Yo now it's time to move
Spit nozzles on the tools

Might just bust him quiet style rules
He walked out the crib yup drinked
We at the elevator base
Staring at the nigga chains shake

We looked at him seen all crooked
The we flashed on him
He knew we was live 
My man Boo stashed on him

Pulled out take of the wool
Nigga cool out
Walk you out the bulding
Betta run nigga move out

This nigga liver than fuck
Larger than fuck betta kill me
All y'all niggas is butt 
What spray it up

Took the chains in case 
Shot him at point blank range
He started screaming like a cave man
Blood got a salty taste 

I can tell furniture fell out his place
Laced now it's a case
Threw up vomit on my Kobe
Snatched all his ice now

Chrome teeth boating of a loan key
Didn't know the kid was large
Hour later call from jail
Mexicans surrounding the Gods

Chill you bigga than the ocean
Slow motion play it off no emotion
But my man in there grossing
What to do they might kill him

We might kill you circulate death
That's how the real do
We sat there 3 live macks of the year
Crack beers one nigga in the back 

Washing off his trackers

The past don't even ask just believe
Looking in the dictionary 
Trying to spell out hard words
Define 'em and design 'em 
I shine and curve
Take this jewel in and conquer me
I blend it in wit ganja
Not for the babies it's a mind sponsor
From the seventeen million God raised 
Two million lost slaved
Nineteen million may we all praise

With another dred named Gov
Both diamond jimmed out
Rockin rentals, spittin phlegm out
Sucked his teeth, two fingers pointin down
What up bonna, passing marijuana to Tanya
CEO of Benny-Hanna, he fucked, sent her to Ghana
He's Benz nigga, rocked shorts, beige Tims nigga he real
Took us to Switzerland, dressed us all ill
Smoking ganja, rocked Anacondas, on next border Elantra
Sent it to his mama
Now that's a major move, the nigga love family
wouldn't hand me no drugs, showed me his jammi
Bulldog Stanley
Flexin on kinal, sit down, do it Chinese style
On graduation day he threw me a towel
He came through, heavy like fuck, suit flammable
Ill pair of gators he copped in Beirut
Had his man wit him, just stare , don't stand wit him
If assassination strike, he gotta make plans wit him
Roll a joint, keep him on point 'Don Troing poing coin'
Freaked it, members like that I want to join
The next day I heard he got knocked , fucked me all up
We felt it on the block, let the seeds rock

Bet cream, them alligators jet like a vet swing
Nigga like nicolas cage with the gauge in your braids
2 cannons that'll spray, rockin' banana suede
Suck this drunk alcohol dick
Fuck y'all niggas with hits
We bout to shit on y'all shit

Y'all brothas want to call us out?
Name names, otherwise it'd be the best to shut the fuck up
Get pimp-smacked up, jacked up and macked up
You're scared and froze of bein' exposed
I own Harlem, I bone harlem, call me the mayor
It's my borough, you don't want no problems
I'm on now, you dead pop, all jokes aside
I ride the top, you glide the bottom
Pitfall, 5 foot 9, my dick, balls
Shit y'all, leave flat line to stick your's
We flip off basic and brace it
8 kills, 47 ways to taste it
Never understand what you never been told
You did your book bitin' off of my scrolls
We hit man, Colombo, coats and hats to match
Bust off quick, and then, guns go back

I move like Arthur ash against god
Four raquets, eight balls and no practice
Every cypher's a heated discussion
The industry was like a beat that needed percussion
I brun the music, shit that make crews flip
State that I'm the illest, this is qu shit
I used to heat-hole, now I'm takin' over like the repo'
Bitches that roll, cee-lo that'll sniff a kilo'
We went from frank's and greens to shanks and beans
Now we drive our navigators to banks in queen's
Y'all can't fuck around, your words ain't right
Every time I touch the mic, they say ""perb ain't right""
But that's the truth though, d'oh, infact that's it
When they drop this shit, I'm gon' cop that shit
The new star, you want me? I'm at the juice bar
Y'all once hap' niggas, give me two stars

I heard what y'all rappin' about, but bring your stash out
You shouldn't throw rocks if you livin' in glass house
Sneak your weak shit at us, on the low though
Where these cats come from, speakin' about po'
He got cash to cop and I'm crashin' 
But half of y'all cats just catchin' up to rae' last year
Got guns in the jungle, call 'em Jurassic
The chrome, the steel, the 20-shot plastic
While y'all niggas cop jars, me and my niggas cop bars
Gettin' head from rock stars
We blowin' everything apart, I'm smashin' the charts
How I see it? (yo, how you see it?)

[chorus]

Eh yo, what you want to be when you grow up?
Yo, I want to be a leader
Slow your speed up and stop tryin' to be us
Say somethin' always, got a future? stay out the hallways
And get yourself right, a one hundred more ways

Fly like iceberg, nice with verbs, precise words
Bentley swerve, hit the curb, jump out, cock back, spit out
Shut your block down, get out, criminal route
Gangsta shit, can't talk now, gun in your mouth
Cream team killas, cocoon cats like caterpillars
Giant size gorillas, break niggas backs from the skrilla
Scratch, greenback track, fed's berserk
That's my word, disrespect recca, get what you deserve
Inferno, melt down mic's, millionaire in my afterlife

Bagged my man Chaz 32 bags he copped flight

It's like grimsday 
Russian hats rocking it the Benz way
That day we got guns on us
Jakes want us, 
Playin' Einstein lenses and Auroras
Little meek caught us 
Couple of francs, peep the blue Taurus
What up tuck your chain they came for us
Jumped out big nines and some hard bottles
Eyes of hate finally meeting up wid the stakes
It was who I thought it was
2 pair of Clarks one pair of Lugz
Wit the hardbottom nigga with the snub
Cocked it, where rock at, stop that
Violate this cipher pa we'll definitely strike back
All of us right there slight fear in our heart
Blink we take it right there 
Doing our thing apart
Broad jumped out tryin' to run shit 
Spoken loud words all we want is his head 
He did some dumb shit
Beef from Miami now
Damn yo big head Lance in some wild shit
Noodles caught the stair down
Now it came back to me yo
Handle it wise and brutally yo
Put down your tooly and talk like men
No shots rang yo, hittin' the ground like mangoes

We did platinum back in '93, we painted pictures you could see
We was living who ya'll tryin' to be
RZA had a vision, instead of cookin coke in the kitchen
He told the God, hit the booth and start spittin
At first it was a dream to me, Ol' Earth buggin
Put your gun down, screamin that the streets is gon' be needin me
I did the Knowledge to the Wisdom that you spoke to me
The Wu become us, the world enbraced us
A new day, a new life for the God

Shootin' at cops, them maggots tried to stop our C.R.E.A.M
But it won't stop, can't stop, my niggas locked down in a box
I feel your pain, I know you're tryin' to come home
All that weak bullshit, I had to leave it alone
Heard my mom's cryin' at night, we rap on the phone, I love you
Never meant to stress you out, do you wrong, yo I'm workin
Then move you from a block to a home
We came from nothin', seein' how the world is so cold
Some niggas comin' out of churches sellin' devil their soul, yo
My neighborhood is crime central, sort of like prisons and cops
One on lock, instead of tryin' to defend you

No longer on the low, pa, I couldn't handle thieves
Too much to live for, I just want to poly and grow
Stack ones and watch my little dun's blow

Aiyo Clientele Kidd
Layin in the crib gettin' ill money, those who 8 hours get gig
Got rugby's on and 4/5ths
Attractin' them niggaz I go against, the money was his
One nasty unit of murderers, all type of Goons'll watch
Then four minutes later they burgulars
I heard from the grapevine mine made it
Elevate the name up, this gift gotta reign and his game went up
And now he's stronger than ever, Nike jackets and Classics
Go against it and it's instant vendettas
He run things, gun down Kings, check the joint the kid flyin' in
Crib in Africa with two lions
Somethin' like the Prince of a jewel thief, so smack the millions
Came back wrapped it up, too sweet
The game is missin' somethin' unique
I put too much to fall back on, I rather just sleep

[Chorus x2: Polite]
CHEF! We designin', rhymin' with Diamonds
CHEF! Ice Water, it was all in the timin'
CHEF! He gave y'all niggaz bricks on consignment
CHEF! To the death and he Billboard climbin'

[Fat Joe]
Yeah uh
Yo Don Carta' bomb harder over nearly everybody
Very rarely you find me without the mini-shotti
Just waitin' for Rae to give met he cue and
You see about 100 Puerto Rican niggaz shootin'
Get down, lay down, we don't play around
I don't know what you heard but, we don't play around
It's cooked coke, but look, but what the fuck happened?
How you leave the dope game to pursue rappin'?
Already knowin' that ya shit was trash
Breathin' hard on the mic when yo' click is ass
All we tryin' to do is bring dignity to rap
And you kiddin' me? I'm literally the epitome of that
Uh, we much better than y'all, Terre-error the Squad
My niggaz set it when we get in the yard
Whether Marcy or Comstock, triggers 'pon cock
Straight punch in ya lung and you niggaz gon' drop
What?

[Chorus x2]

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo yo yo shoot him in his mouth.. (nah)
Fuck him, get the gasoline tell Terry to pull the act up
Bring him to Rae warehouse, hang him from hooks then skin his ass
As lame as he look he ready to cook (yeah)
And he pleadin' for mercy, bleedin' from his dome and he thirsty
The first week we made him eat shit!
Videotaped his wiz and I fucked his bitch
Made him watch me on the couch havin' fun with his kids
So what hurts more: is it me showin' love to ya fam?
Or you in the box laid under the floor?
Or keep you alive blow torchin' ya balls?
My murder chainsaw, ya bloods on my Scarface walls
Not even Ajax can clean that, Jack
We need that maintenace man shit that kill that greasy blood on contact
Finish you off 'cause I'm pressed for time
Your man and 'em will be next to die

[Chorus: Tiffany Villareal]
Some day, I know you'll be far away
I'll be right here to stay, give me one day
Baby, baby, don't, run away, come see me
Some day, I'll be right, here today, just give me love, Rae.

[Raekwon]
To my hood, I'm always there for you
Rain, hail, sleet, snow, and I'm there
For all the underprivileged, yo we here
My life is all in your soul, daily, since nana left us
She took all of your blessings, 'cause she been there
My life change, yo, could never though be without you, yo
It's strange when I want it to rain
On my best friend's grooming, we all had visions of you
We broke nights, God, knowing you cared
Peace, nigga, only for a minute and I'mma break out
Come back and kiss you on your feet, here
I love my hood, I love my niggaz, there, yo
The older we get, we understand, you might tear

[Chorus w/ ad-libs]

[Raekwon]
You keep the little young ones, happy, true
Graduations occurred, you look so pretty and new
Look at the sky, all blue, all old people with you
Facilities mailing, jail brothers miss you
Wow, it gets crazy when I think about the money you made me
Slipped me away, but Jakes tried to rade me
Nighshifts, smokin' on spliffs, you kept yellin'
""Carry your fifth, the down the block niggaz is gay""
They keep police invadin' your space, we can't live
Plus, they gassin' the mayor, them niggaz wanna give you away
We won't have that, suburban people mad at the fact
That you be gettin' more company then them, they just be scared of that
""Hood"", look at your name, spell it backwards
Yo, ""Dooh"", that's what they yellin' in vain
You the realest, the most livest, flyest, you part of life
I gotta give you love, 'cause you gave it God and life

[Chorus w/ ad-libs]

[Raekwon]
Who ever said you ain't do right by me, they frontin', yo
They couldn't understand that we was a team
I used to come out, hear you words, talk to me, walk with me, brother
Cool, try to be successful and dream
The city lights is on, now, they wanna turn 'em off
Try'nna start some shit, actin' like you never made a penny for 'em
Dun, they doin' you dirty, we had Summer Youth for that, though
No need to cry, never get worried
You gon' live forever, word to mother
'cause she raised you right, and you got fifty-one brothers
I sat with the trees and had conversations at bees
We talked about throwin' money up, landscapin' your knees
You forget that, something to talk about
Show me where to take the check, pay these suckas off and be out
The'll never be another place, everybody happy to see
That's why I keep coming back to you, peace

Stuck, y'all like gum underneath my kick
Better move little when the heat I'll spit

When you cowards see the drama and it come to a head

I've been the greatest, been flippin' the latest

Lately, I had a love that would ignite all the fire
The desire would leave, for you I'd admire
Lately, you seem all corrupt
I've had enough and you forced me to hide under covers
Drove me to arms of another

Broke the top of goose-down shits, kissed her on the neck
Real love, hope this ain't the last time we meet
Felt like a king who had a queen want him
I usually deserve hotels, this one's the gift, slick

On our eye-to-eye contact, body movement, all on the grind
A lady's starin' at me, all in my mind
Sayin', ""Boo, I gotta live with you, let's connect and be a bridge""
You stay three forths and I'm-a wiz you

Sayin', months ago, you came to me
Told me, love me forever
See, time has passed and lonely days
Have rid his head now, stormy weather

But out of the rain, came some delight
I ain't ashamed, I know that it's right
The way that I'm feelin'
He touches me, in ways I like

Says things you won't, won't day or night
Givin' me healin, I'm leavin'
'cause you wanted to know that is the reason

Lately, I had a love that would ignite all the fire
The desire would leave, for you I'd admire
Lately, you seem all corrupt
I've had enough and you forced me to hide under covers
Drove me to arms of another

The only set back in my state of grace
Is that the love is real, for you and him in different ways and
You're out in space, yes here on earth it's fun to play
I wish you were present so my love wouldn't go astray
And he gives what I need
Quenches my thirst when you say ""Girl, please""

That's a waste of my breath
And it's funny to me that you get upset
And I told you quite often
I'ma fill up the space, did ya think I was talkin'
Out the side of my neck?
You left me alone, what did you expect?

Lately, I had a love that would ignite all the fire
The desire would leave, for you I'd admire
Lately, you seem all corrupt
I've had enough and you forced me to hide under covers
Drove me to arms of another

I'm dead in my sleep, she's standin' over the kid
I'm terrified, shorty was deep
I had my hand in her account plus livin' in a lab
Like a count, I had to go six shorties was pink yo
She had the yolk on me that's when I went broke

We used to flip coke together, get boasted and float
We split real bread, we was large
We had our weddin' in the garage
And then she stopped reviewin' my bars
Hold up

Lately, I had a love that would ignite all the fire
The desire would leave, for you I'd admire
Lately, you seem all corrupt
I've had enough and you forced me to hide under covers
Drove me to arms of another

Livin' in apartments, wild he violated flight a Bianca
Took two hundred niggas down but two men houndin' him

Who you gon' call when them dogs come confront you?
You stand firm or be the bitch that you is?
Would you grab the guns or run into the pigs, you mothafucka, huh?

It's time to die, who you gon' run to?
Who you gon' call when them dogs come confront you?
You stand firm or be the bitch that you is?
Would you grab the guns or run get yo' wiz, you mothafucka, huh?

y'all niggas see me eatin' all of ya plate
Don't give a fuck about ya background, shit about the songs you make
And I know you see the draw on the waist
Lookin' stupid with a vest on, these bullets might draw on ya face

They call me Alexander Sean the Great
'cause ya bitch said she love the way the dick talk all in the cake
I need this bank money, throw me the safe
All these killas involved, the cops'll fuck around and chalk the place

Yo, they wonder why we hang with crooks
Shit is take free, I see not used to money off the books
Broke faggot nigga caught in a jukes
I'm a pirate in this rap shit, I leave you niggas off the hook

What the fuck you gon' do when we run in ya crib?
Either we leavin' with the bricks or we gon' leave with yo' kids
And we only got hours to live
So give up the ransom or find they ass up under the bridge

'Lite never been afraid, so keep lookin' niggas
'cause I'll rob yo' ass faster than some Brooklyn niggas
Yo this rap game twisted, everybody beefin'
Everybody killas now and ain't nobody leakin'

Smoke a lot of weed so I don't like to fight
But I might go upside ya fuckin' head with a pipe
Got a bulldog, not only do he bark he bite
Give a fuck about a hood, it ain't safe at night
You fucker

Yo, it's time to die, who you gon' run to?
Who you gon' call when them dogs come confront you?
You stand firm or be the bitch that you is?
Would you grab the guns or run to the pigs, you mothafucka, huh?

Young motherfuckers, man

Fo' fo' long in yo' motherfuckin' mouth, boy?
Shot in yo' face
Who the fuck you gon' call?
Call the cops

Raekwon,"[Intro: Raekwon]
Take it back 1993, '94 or something
Yeah, runnin' through the stairs and shit
Trynna to get to the roof
Narcotos is on, some other shit

[Chorus 2X: Raekwon]
My niggas won't stop til we straight, select bigger gates
We won't stop until we buyin' estate, yo
Pull out them burners and front, where I'm from
Better shoot something, if not, niggas won't salute nothing

[Raekwon]
Corner filled chains and Gucci glasses
The was the era when we flipped all the shh, on the store, splashed it
Had Dominicans runnin' and eatin' steak and cheese sandwiches
They in the back, braggin', the fifth slut
Fuckin' with a few niggas nieces, take it back when we would
Rock for a leases and stand on the speakers
I got the shit locked, I'll battle you, you, you and your whole gridlocked
Little shit, supported the beef
Fly Pierre couldn't tell me nothin' with a brand new beard
Couldn't wait, but kept survivin' the years
We sold crack daily, crack mad bailey's, crack faces and skulls
Sit back, watchin' the mack, twist carefully
It was them horrifyin' times, spit dimes
Police sneak up, I hope he know the time, get mine
Just livin' the ghettos, where we suppose stand loyal
But the game'll get you trapped when it's time, yo

[Chorus 2X]

[Raekwon]
The year's 1990, everybody grimey
Crack was what's in it, the vehicles was 1-90's
Young shorties be gettin' their bread, haunted by Jamaicans
Them niggas had their corners on red
Map the laws, runnin' cards, playin' bars
Mask the coke in the cars, twist the gan', mad, crackin' cigars
Smokin' through Queens, bitches stealin' Guess jeans
Get the scope on our stars, little did we know, we folow they dreams
Now we get around in live limosines, flash stacks in cuisines
Combat, get to smackin' the fiends, just max for a minute and lean
All the shit for the moment, slick omens, my opponents would scheme
We were shot downtown, hit trains, buy cables and remain
The illest villains, walkin' in spots
Playin' the corners, baby, vision or not
Said yo, and when it's on, we gon' rep and rock, nobody call the cops

[Chorus 2X]

[Raekwon]
Where all the major swingers, yo
Where all the live fresh, came home, up state livin' fly rangers
We rep them niggas and we love 'em
Sons, we hug 'em, they make it home and be gone in a week
That's some letters, all my niggas live together
Baby yellin' whatever, we all write in hands, nothin' but creeps
Hold me down, love, I'll hold you fatter
Watch me catch both of these actors, it's Ice Water throwin' hits in the cling
Bloodhounds is on you, goons is beamin'
Take it to the team to team, plot thing, blew you a bean
It's just a young poor hustlers thing
But your gun got a ring, if you gonna live like a young kid

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Raekwon]
Too all them killas and the bank robbers
This is another, another, Smith Bros. production

You know what time it is",Smith Bros.
Raekwon,"Don't take it personal, it's only music
Holla at me, yo, yo, ice water, yo, yo, yo, yo

Try me, PC'll put a clip in a nigga
Fuck a hole, my bullets'll dig a ditch in a nigga
Listen, I've been reppin', only pack big weapons
One shot to the stomach, you missin' ya midsection

I'm off the wall, dog, I could off ya balls
Stick his ass to the rooftop, toss 'em off
Hit the ave with the rooftop off the porch
I get money 'cause it costs to floss, nigga you feelin' me?

And if not then fuck what you gotta deal with me
I'm only here for a minute but haters wanna get rid of me
PC creep with at least three heats
And a shotgun stashed underneath the backseats

You niggas actin' like you don't feel a draft
You seen ya man, tell him I'ma kill his ass
And I don't, wanna talk I want a mill in cash
I come through 'tards shittin', lookin' ill in the past

'cause it's the, ice water, don't get it confused
And one false move'll cause me to spit at you dudes
It's stumic, motherfucker and I'm pickin' ya food
And ain't no one out you know that my niggas'll do you

Let's spit on 'em, rush these niggas
[Incomprehensible] dead with a punctured liver
Only kid in the hood with a mustard ninja
Heard you broke down good, well I fucked ya sister

Eh yo we wyld in da club, style in the club
This is for my niggas gettin' down in the club
At the bar throwin' down rounds in the club
Talk slick and get the four pound in ya mug

Yo we wyld in da club, style in the club

Y'all touch my property somebody gon' die, uh huh
This ain't no joke, it's for real, my niggas they totin' they steel
All it takes is a phone call and they ready to ride

Eh yo the cards are dealt, the words are spoken
Nigga, welcome to the hell, the gates is open
Gatekeeper, first degree murder through the speaker
Who deep enough to flow with the reaper?

Stuck in the middle, I spit a little riddle
Leavin' niggas crippled, my niggas ball 'em like Kerry Kittles
You niggas makin' it hard, it's really kinda simple
If a nigga gotta pull it out I'm puttin' it in ya temple

Official I do this, rude maneuver
I use the rugers to keep the bullets movin' through ya
Weak anatomy, fuck the small talk and flattery
Ya power is weak, to beef you need much more batteries

Keep it genetic, or dead it, ice water inc we said it
Whoever so-called did it or said it, promote it and spread it
Fake it or front it, get ambushed and confronted
With slugs in ya head, back, chest and stomach

Niggas don't want it or ask for it, so we give it to 'em dead in the club
And let them things spit and rip through 'em dead in the club
Is you gon' fuck around and be the nigga dead in the club?

Eh yo we wyld in da club, style in the club
This is for my niggas gettin' down in the club
At the bar throwin' down rounds in the club
Talk slick and get the four pound in ya mug

Yo we wyld in da club, style in the club
This is for my niggas gettin' down in the club
At the bar throwin' down rounds in the club
Talk slick and get the four pound in ya mug

Egyptian look, gazelles on, L's lit, this how it's goin' down
Ski mask, channel shit, move like a terrorist click
Nineteen eighties babies, worldwide, ya girl on our dick

All you know is Rae look good, he hood, envision the flips
I make money like them niggas who take money
Fresh out the can, Duran look, astro van
The ill Castro, rap son of Sam

More rugers, more bow and arrows still no losers
Forty five dollars ahead, I go at niggas shootin' lyrical leads
Stop absorbin', break shit knock that gay shit out ya head

Wyld in da club, style in the club
This is for my niggas gettin' down in the club

Holding my bear, rock and roll in my Lear

Strings is nothing, get your hoe clapped, king
We hundred burners, onion turners, all this, came out the yard
With twenty five to lifers, loving my squad
You know the gun show off, whips is gleaming, clean as a fuck
In dirty hallways, the ninas'll cluck
This is crime station, my obligation is to look raw as ever
Feed my little sons and patients
Cause they hungry, shining, bullet fly right through the lining

I throw five in your Champ hood, and envy your squad
You try to stick out your fucking hand, nah, I don't want no dap, nigga
Fucking lucky you ain't get glammed
Bitch ass nigga, you wrong, yo, you mingle with rats
The other day you got caught with the gat, nigga
How you home, nigga? Why you even up in my square?
Like you get busy, got the block hot and stare
Fresh coffins fast, they spitting, y'all fake bitches
Snitches get mad love, hundred and eight stitches
My condolences, word life, if they can find you a real killa
Someone close is singing like the Jonases
Crime Stoppers, the tips keep pouring in
For a G, you be suprised who's going in
Block huggers, the ones who be holding they jock
And suck my cock, the real cock lovers

Y'all can call me cook up or come back
My flow hot, my hood hot, cause of one rat
My block on fire cause of one match
I spit with paper like thumbstacks, 
These cougars wanna play all these
Young cats with pussy, turning boys to men, so I resort to the pen
But at the same time, I'm pointing the pen
And now it's game time, nigga, you in? You better thicken your skin
Move with your peoples through the thick and the thin
I watch for po-po, they raiding the crib
And I ain't trying to get jammed, and have the next man raising my kids
God forbid, dudes be hating on his, because a nigga go hard
And hit 'em harder then they saying they is
But that's just New York, I carry the torch, just long enough
To light a Newport and carry this thought
Fuck what you thought, the bigger the boss, bigger the cost
They don't know about the Tribe of Shabazz, niggas is lost

Peace, pussies, trees, hello, how was your day? Have you seen the prince? 
Haven't seen him since he pushed Humpty Da-Dumpty fell off the fence 
The smurfs fell out laughin', Heckle toe Jeckle at min,
They took my medicade card, he's a good friend
Bugs still sniffin', Daffy Duck snitchin'
And heard that crazy Bird took the stand on the Simpsons
Bet you ""my golly, oh glory"" with a story to tell 
Droopy got knocked, now he Muslim in jail
His name is Abdrul, Colorful, Snow White tattoo
She used to send him mad flicks in Cash Rule
And the cat too, old girl who's clackin' her shoes
And that wicked witch broke her broom, clappin' at school
It happens every night, I seen it, shoot outs in Jellystone Park
Kermit had the whip, he did from the Narks
They bagged Woody, Shaggy shot dead in his hoodie
Tweety did the Bird, ""I thaw, I thought I thaw a putty""
Ghost, please you don't even want to know
Droopy Long wrote a song, like to hear it, here it go
Ricochet Rabbit had a habit, he was savage
Bruto slapped, Magoto slapped out his glasses backwards
Magelity used to come to class wit rachets
He was known in the hood, plus good for his classics
Slashes, blast four-fifths, diamond cut, hollow point tips
Big Boy bustin' out his corderoy fix
Eleven, way beyond is little boy fit
Magoo, he gon' catch him at the teachers' conference
So later that week durin' open school night
Everybody there, saw open school fight
Blows is big, Olive Oil was pissed
The wolf was too, they murdered one of the pigs
He said, ""What great big heat you have""
He replied, ""Fuck my gun I'll eat you fast""
He said, ""What great big teeth you have""
""Mothafu, you better look at all the beef you have""

And my guns weight more, yo, then Gerald Levert
With more blubber than a Ruben Studdard, I grease the pan
With rhymes, and y'all can't believe it's not butter

Just that I knew him for like 18 years until he violated, stealing my gear
If my lil' homey, yo he eat anything for me
Send him uptown, he get bagged, yo he never call me
Come home and still blow cats for me
Pump crack, stabbing all them hoodrat shorties
A live gunslinger well known, born to dance
When the heat is on, Stapleton days, shoot himself in the groin
The gun went off, it looked like a flick
When he fell to the floor, holding his nuts, screaming ""God dammit
Shit I put one in my balls, what the fuck y'all looking at me for?
Call the police, do something
Motherfuckers standing around, watch when I get better
All hell's gonna be terror
Death to you, you,"" he pointed at Red
I said chill that's fam duke
He put real work in that make you cute, fuck that
But anyway son indeed, he stole two Polo rugbies
Swore to his dead mother, I couldn't take it

It was the best heist since ice
Precise rituals
Skated outta Jacob's wit the Fruit Loop jewels
Holding a navy blue uzi
Krush Grooving waves off the atlas
Cooling, that's how we make movies
Basketball gun brawlers, bounce
Black down 'bill-a-head banks, Malibu colorful shanks
That's the way we live, Staten Island kid
Old dog in it, the thug vaccine wit no pork in it
Vivid imagination paper chasing
Dufflebag swollen, we holding
Drink chocolate milk before we roll in
It's like that y'all, we gangstas
Sticking all you Bay Ridge Benzes
I'm out to get erect, terrific shit be the diamond district
Tiffany's, pretty Valentine brick is on the second floor balcony

Hey yo caught em at the ice pavilion
Dressy, salad bar style Nestle
Four white niggas, covered in vest pieces
Think like a mob flick
Guessing like Patsy in the mask, piece bust
Got aggravated, slapped the glass piece
One nigga beaming, fagot ass
Lay on the floor ya fuck!
Tied his broken arm to his Hush Puppies
Wrapped around trauma, everything realer than fuck
Tajuana left my nigga niece live comma
Three young Italians, suited down personal style
I'm in valour white designing on the 'dallions
Felt like some crackers was in back of me
Spit on the clerk, pass the Harry Winston set
Ghost backing me
Bust a shot, motored
Four male in paper work Lord
We get together once more before we blow this
Murdered nobody
Left em all baseball'd down, brother

Somewhere in Africa

Whipping the Acuras, feel like a mac busting
A rug in Preston on percussion
I'll bust in your gate, nigga it's nothing
A hail storm, ice raining, mind containing
Info, nigga what you in for? Complaining
Sick bars deep in this language
Did I tell you how my day's spent?
Speaking through the face of Ronald Regan
Iceberg History, calligraphy
Colidescope colors, hollow-head shells and flaring gunmen
Hate to see me coming like gray skies on day of judgment
Makes you wonder where the love went
Hit a nigga, feed him to some buzzards
Put up numbers, plus I'm one to push his mug in
We duck in the safe, check what I'm hugging
Rocks the size of some shit, out in the congo
My arms full, let's get the fuck out, Busta I got you

Hey yo we do great study on fossils and stones like archeologists
Gem-ologists, collect the most priceless ices anonymous
Canary stones yellow like a pumpkin
Dunking Donut precious size stones make me want to cut the safe open

Marciano brought a chisel wit an ice pick
Princess cuts, invisible settings
Planning the world's greatest diamond heist playin a tune by Otis Redding
Icicle cones hang from the ceiling just like stalagmites
Time to throw on a skully and tying a rag tight
Throwing light went off and in the basket
Grabbed the necklace from off the satin pillow while the glass casket
Ice lay across the crushed burgandy velvet
Up in the diamond slide-tray
Gun in your face, slide it right away
Roundtable with Habib, Mirishnokof, and the rest of them Jewish niggas
We got them niggas drunk and talking foolish see
You know the way we straight manipulated the shit
We swindle them niggas for all their precious things before we skated and shit
Yeah, y'all niggas know we skated early 
Disguised ourselves as the cidic Jews and even left my sideburns curly
Bounce to Mexico and spend some pesos
And bury the diamonds on an island your never heard

Understand, I watched you go through a lot of trials and tribulations
But you know something, like I used to always tell you baby
A good listener's a good learner
(G O D's my reality)

I see you listened very well, understand?
(I'm elevating strong and I'm gonna go on to the highest degree)
Your time is coming baby
See sometime, it could be like, a rear view
You know what I'm sayin'?
And people don't know when their blessing comes

But I watch you grow, man you is a very intelligent man
Man, I watched you when I used to sit down and you would
Trick me out my money shootin' dice, niggaz is you crazy?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

Crazy you crazy man
Yo Rae, you remember that shit man?
When we used to be down there in the hills and shit man?
(I'm elevating strong I'm gonna go on to the highest degree)
And you'd catch it, from Old Man Freed

He'd be yelling, ""You little slick ass""
Ha ha ha ha
Talk to me baby, know what I'm sayin'?
Ha ha ha ha
I've been through all them things, man I'm watchin' you growin'

But remember one thing Rae like I used to tell you
The child you was is making you the man you is today
And if you don't know where you came from baby
You damn sure know that you don't know where you going
Can you see what I'm saying? Know which way you traveling
(We've got the powers to resurrect the dead)

You understand? And follow that destiny, follow the light
And it'll set you free
(Oh, G O D's my reality)
'Cause I've watched you baby, you my main man, yeah
(We're elevating strong and we're going on to the highest degree)

Now that could be the Wu-Tang production
Start to knuckle up and, gun shots start to click the block's duckin'
Could it be, and would it be, that we was babies
Catchin', rabies, niggaz seem to act crazy

Day one, in my spot July the tenth
I had a mint, stickin' up Devine's hittin' them with nines
I was toxie, from layin up in Roxie's all night
This nigga bust a shot, lick my man's wife

It was havoc I contact the Abbot
He shook the shoulder though
Then he passed the phat chrome automatic
We goin' to war, you know we headed to the floor
He woulda, did it, for me fuck it, let's mosie

Schemin' dough, with the P.L.O., wrapped on tight
Sayin' in my mic, ""Yo we gotta go""
My first impression was to add some lessons
Question, one, what made you even
Show your gun and blow the session?

He replied and rocked the green eye
And yo, he started, yellin', ""Them niggaz sellin' two for fives""
But he's a goner and I got my corner
What, I'm feedin' my babies, Cash Rules for mortal daughters

Yeah, Rae baby
Feedin' my babies, Cash Rules for mortal daughters
Only God is the son of man
(We've got the powers to resurrect the dead)

I'll say it one time, and be certain that fake God does not exist
(Oh, G O D's my reality)
(I'm elevating strong we're gonna go on to the highest degree)
This is why the universe, has itself balanced the scale

Of divine knowledge, and it was measured by the portion
Of solid knowledge, no man, can judge for another
But each man must weigh all facts and circumstances
And find truth in his own judgment of righteousness

See, the way to evil, balance equality in no man
For no man is good and bad at the same time
Either you good, or you bad

Bleeding out the side of his ear, niggas was staring
And the silk shirt was ripped off, Punch cut his hair
Razors was bloody, he kept hitting, Dred grabbed his shirt
Showing his stomach, the kid had zippers on him
Bitches was flipping, they grabbed Tasha, caught her for a Louis
Snatched her titties right up out the bitch bra

Bolt his gun off, from know your horse, she lied

Rock fitted hats, get crack money and drive a sick blue joint
Retard-less, I'mma blow regardless
Resume is straight up live, I shank niggas up for larger E's

Mop wringer magic, mess hall murder's the best
Come through the yard, getting fed lead burgers
Testing anything with bling
Fresh sneakers, we the best teachers
True, watch me move in the cling

Six A.M., the cells unlock
Horn the child, I'm half sleep, yo, hearing the pots
I see the same ice grills, bum niggaz talking to me
With coal in they eye, I can't finish my meal
(Under the grits, two pieces of steel)
Then Spoon had left, we got guns though, we trying to chill
Big Will walked in, him and Seville
(With blood in they eyes, early bird like they ready to kill)

He had a mask on, 4-5, 'Why did you kill him?'
It was supposed to happen, click the shit back (clack, clack clack)
This is the deal, you get on the floor, lay in the grass
Had me handcuffed, take two puffs of the kush
I see you out here, your name's real, can't let you get touched
He had a team, Japanese fiends, all of 'em creamed down
Cheeba lit, blood on his Adidas was thick (oh, shit)

Grabbed the nigga head, broke his Rolly
Where the blow, shorty?
Shorty start smilin', y'all niggas is puss
Yo Lex, these niggas ain't vets, they gush

Untied him he fell legs weak and son wouldn't tell, now it gets deep
Son start fallin' asleep, they woke him back up
Smacked him wit the Mac, where your slut?
I heard you copped a new Beamer and them glasses is rough (where your bitch, man?)
They was the ferla joints, 18 karats, bought 'em right in Brazil
He had to steal on him, niggas went savage
The hat him spread out, T-position, opened his jeans up
Shot him in the leg bone, he rose up like King Tut
Still riffin', this wop for real? My niggas still get it
All of us yellin' he ill wit it

They clapped him and the scalp it flew that way
Yo why they capped him? It went through his lap
Snatched his Audemars Piguet, took his mango, get at

Raekwon,"Well it was late one night, walking through the park
With my leathered down coat and wallabee Clarks
Getting my step on, big shit, big six, big wrist
So much excitement in the air, I was crisp
Money suitcase, Louis joint (yo, Rae, I'mma get some shit just like yours!)
Go make it happen, black God and get rich
Saw the D's fly by, in a New Yorker, yup, tints and shit
They made a right on me, them last two dicks
Know I seen 'em, Max loaded, jog right back to the car
They spun around again and blast they shits
I dropped a Backwood, a puff and then a 6-4-5
You'se a live nigga, you almost smashed yo shit
I'mma don my way out the bitch, moving through the car
Nice and slow, two hoodies on and a golden pit
Nigga had a white eye, they both blacked down
What's the clown shit for? The dog jumped in the whip
It was a trained one, wops pointed at me (yo, nigga, freeze)

I told the Chef Raekwon, pump the breaks
Slow it down, you know these C-Cypher Punks scanned your plates
Release the seatbelt off the shoulders, a mile ahead
Then the vibe got a lot colder when the marksman said
""Black niggas in the Jeep, get the fuck out the car""
""Put your hands where my eyes can see or suffer a scar""
He was a veteran, who kept, pepper spray in the cannister
Donut shop lounger, thirty eight brandisher
On top of that, the blunt smoke just rang a bell
Of his bloodhound who had an acute sense of smell
Beef tripping, saliva dripping from razor sharp teeth
That was pointy as the daggers of the Indian Chiefs
Same cops known for exorting pimps and booking whores
Aimed glocks at me and Rae, cuz they was looking for
A few MC's wanted for a string of break-ins
Last seen, wearing long minks and snakeskins

We will, we will, rob you
We will, we will, glock you
We will, we will, what? who? (not you)

See knowledge is the foundation of existence
To know starts the spark of the flow
Wisdom activation of the Nation moving
Wise words, show and prove or understand the 13 letters
And the Masta, culture be the way of life
Freedom is reward, who will pay the price for the power
Spending hour after hour, preparing his self
For the hour, now look how refined

Polo rugbies, flags on my hats, you love these
Knockout artists are one-piece
Fly in a foreign, all my money ties is tied-up

The bitch is on the block like, he died scrambling
Cause L frames is crack, popped out, nina one of his eyes
Can't come back home, they locked out
All he did was re-up, hustle for kick money
Kept Beez all around him, thinking he shit honey
Bow, I'm into bobsleds, wasting large bread
Gucci helmet is blue, trim in his dark red
The rap TJ Swan, it's me Ason

Old times sake, just for me, man, one more time, I'm begging you
Let me just go in, and just fly on these niggas heads, man
It's what I'm talking about

It's like a body in a project hallway, who did it?
Who's the next nigga that sucked the snit-ich
That's my word, it could never be me
You see the deer head on the living room wall, like his neck fell off
That can be all sculptured and glazed with gloss
Call the shots that Bill Belichick would call
Snake niggas slither all in the glass house, racial slurs
When it's time to go to war, they cash out
Throw 'em in the rear-naked choke, they tap out
Niggas try to surround the kid, I backed out
And threw two rocks at 'em, watching the ho drop
I'm from a place where we locking the low glocks
Yellow tape, the bodies, jiggy and road blocks
Got the towels up in the air, it's so hot
Talking bout Staten Island, profiling
Switchblade city, the goons is wilding
Escape from my slums, nigga, you got talent
And we don't want the fifth of 'yac, we want the gallon

What you think I'm a fucking worm like you?

Vacate black, bust gats, wherever we at
You all that, hit 'em in the chest, we fall back
I got mines, nigga, where yours at?
We call that, raw rap, got fiends in front of my door mat
That Witty Unpredictable fly shit, drive-by shit

One suuu, Staten Isle on 'em
I bank roll, I break codes, and I ain't trynna catch another case, case closed

Stepping out the crib like I'm sixed up, don't get it mixed up
Even if I'm shaking your hand, I'm still gripped up
With two spots left, yeah, we still bricked up
Trees pine, gleem no seed, young boys feeling they self, they must be on E's
Me? I stay outted out, boating on oceans
He banging my old chick, and he mad open
Think I smell the goons, they been business since the Tunnel days
Shanks out, they ready to move

In two seconds, lord, they was up on 'em
That voice, should of slowed down, baby
Now what we gon' tell his lady
Jaw on the floor, looking all crazy
A lot of vicks been going down in here, lately

In 2012, the DJ is still recognized as the crowd controller
The record breaking, keep the bottles popping and all the ass shaking

It's that Wu shit, it's that movement
It's the Wu shit, in the house

Yo, should I talk about all the jewels I wore on my neck
While you had to tuck your little shit in out of respect
I'm a done, rebel out of Staten Island projects
I dare y'all to come in my projects
Leave with no head, no neck
You thought I was Flex, the way I bombed the set
In the hallway, banger house, smelling like cake
Tongueing bitches down, most of them got scraped
Watch how I move the crowd, I'm a make 'em, make 'em clap to this
No shit, no doubt
Two shots of Hennessey, ladies want Goose
Earlier them fronting niggas, now they want a truce
Mami got a bubble in her Jimmy Choo shoe
When I go and kick it, she's a goodie two-shoe?
Yeah, right, daddy got bread
Like J. Holiday, I wanna put you to bed
Tell me your girlfriends, kicks, don't let it go to your head
Walking around in your cheap ass threads
Get away from me, stinky

[Chorus]

Yeah, yo, I spit lines from the rubble room
Bottom line, I kick mines, like a mother's womb
I'm, still in my prime, fuck them other dudes
No biting's the rule, but we can eat each others food
Flash a camera at the all time great
Single handing increase New York's crime rate
That's why I love it in the Empire State
The city where your fat ass can still find weight
But y'all ain't getting it, the game is different
And in the recession, a lot of veterans is quitting it
Every day I'm living it, your boy got blunts
Fighting after school, a lot of y'all got jumped
Staten Island, bro, ratchet under my coat, potato salads so
And we silencing that, just every day challenge us

Word up, man (fuck them)

Spit in your mouth, piss on your bitch

Dumb move, blast your slut
We want it all, living in Persia, burn something

Rap athletes, the trap sheet bigger than you
If you ask me, the Cash Rule
Nigga, eat that pussy, you cat food
I sneeze on the track, get at you
I'm sick in the head, I'm getting some head
If she ain't bout getting some bread, don't get in this bed
Real talk, mami, you gotta bounce

Wild like Indians, Al Capone-ians
Not from Chicago, my gun named Margo
It's only when we in beef, we humble in deep
Might kill four-five niggas, die in my sleep
I argue though, who the best, we hardly know
I came through in the S, wash me, yo
Yo, yo, do that for me, go around that car

Niggas, digging they nose, and digging they ass
When I got chips, can't none of y'all dig in my bag
I pop shit, my killas is black, I got chicks that got chicks
My real world realer than rap
I'm hot, bitch, material, Meth, beyond lyrical

When it's going down, I'm gon' rain
That's my chair, nigga, get the fuck out of it

Yo, fuck you, pay me, if Dirt Dog could see me now
He'd probably say ""Fuck you, pay me""
Blowing smoke clouds, shit's crazy
Doo-rag your dome, get wavy, rap ain't done shit for me lately
It's ass backwards, this game trynna play me
I bet this never happens to Jay-Z
Get money, fuck them haters, real talk

Pay me, play me, weigh he, just the right measurement
This may happen in a day, G
I'm a keep it real, for real G's, niggas is lame
Industry pussies, we can't feel these
Regardless that I'm paid in flossy, rich in the mind
I do this for the nine niggas who forced me
Y'all niggas is playing me, man",Mef vs Chef 2
Raekwon,"Yo, man, just let her live, man, stop playing, man
Oh, shit, B, where's Miranda? (She with Chef)

I dreamed it, Chef out in Cuba, a ruger
Thirty thou' on him, out in Mr. Chow, blew a cloud on him
Seen a Latin chick, laughing, clapping
Like your style, homey, tell your proud, hit the Crystal
Now we chatting, coebers and klickos, who do this a size six
She split up, had a brick, I peeped those
Her jeans was fitted, hair twisted, long as a fuck
She looked Indian, titties was plump
Had juicy lips, dimples, imprint on her pussy was mad thick
She grabbed my dick, hopped in the window
We in the Monte Carlo, bravo, uncle named Pablo
Gun connect, and he had his poke in Los Cabos
Good money, honey was strung, playing Luther in the background
Spanish version, my bunny was horny as fuck
Working the kid, we burst later, lay in the bed
Duvet sheets, my face hit the spread
Then time me, I'm not the kind of nigga, I was cool down at night
Drop my gun, shorty, my nigga
Body was sexy, ""Lexy, come here, nigga, take off your drawers
Let me suck your dick, nigga, it's yours
Got real watery, Corey, damn you got good dick
You forty"" spit on it, position your jaw
Call me 8-Ball, this pussy like China, climb the Great Wall
Then she came like volcanos in the late fall

Lady Miranda, she half black and white like a panda
I met her at the BET Awards, in Atlanta
Glamor girl, shopping in Bloomingdale's, skin pure
Keep a fresh manicure, hands with the cutest nails
Wall Street banker, hold accounts with Jewish now
Big businessmen, who own stocks in computer sales
Meanwhile, I'm checking her jeans out, imagining
Her fat bubble, riding my dick, making her scream out
She got a mean mouth, her lips is like soup coolers
Hotter than niggas riding around with six rugers
Miss Beaulah took a day off with a rich jeweler
When she came back she had a suitcase full of Fig Newtons
I met her at a villa in Vancouver, blowing her man's buddah
Bumping Mary J. and that Grand Puba
Check the 411, from a smooth operator
Got some pictures of her naked, I'll send them to Un later

Ay Dio mio, mamacita ass bonita
Remind me of the nights of Del Rio
I met at the Cotto fights, playing my seat though
That night, the linen was white, me and my hijos
Live from Puerto Rico, San Juan, where niggas sniff pedrico
Look at your man wrong, finito
Girl you know how we go, you getting my grown man on
Fuck with you primo, maybe I'm hands on, I'll massage your ego
And be the love of your life, you know your people, a thug and his wife
Gave a look, she was touching my ice, so I looked at my dick
Like don't worry, we fucking tonight
She boricua, cinnamon skin, sign is Libra
She like wife beaters and men that like to eat her
Then I meet your feet up, meet me in room 112, light this reefer
You act right, and after tonight, I might keep ya",Miranda
Raekwon,"Yeah, them niggas talking bout y'all always want some lyrics, right?
Real lyrics, well here we go, I'm a tell you a little story
That's right, watch this shit, nigga, here we go, y'all, your ass
Yeah, we write for days, hot shit, uh-huh
Dope, drugs, sex, murder, King James version

Aiyo, needle was left hanging, in the arm of a pimp
He walk with a limp, had bitches on the payroll
He gave the seeds candy and his family was poor
Drove a '68 Caddy with the fur on the door
The other macks ain't have jack on him, not even Goldie
Slowly, he would rise, kept his runners with the police
Jim Brown was his man, his brother was Muslim, they tried to convert him
And turn righteous, but the streets got the good of him
Big hats with gorgeous stones, honey designed the slacks
With two attempts on his bottom bitch, her name was Precious
Silky skin, priceless pussy, she took karate
Her bubble ass got Pretty Chipp rich
You can smell her perfume on every street corner
A sexy motherfucka with the mean face on her
Precious, sported bulletproof dresses, defending caring sex
Thirteen smith, this boo that study her lessons
She was the key to Pretty Chipp riches, bitches is fortune slang
Control the south side, her name rings
Lookout for the black cherry pussy extortion
Any other hoes get pregnant, bet they get an abortion
Back at the pub, at the Alice spot, bumping the sounds of Curtis
Playing Live in the jukebox, this broad named Cookie
In the purse, fifty thou' in cash
Passed off to Chipp, told him count it fast, another 10 in my bloomers
Fuck the rumors, it's lies, baby, you my daddy
Bitches never saw me jumping out of Dirt Dog's cabby
I'm a loyal bitch, and chicks can't stand me, pimps
They know I'm ill, that's why they never put hands on me
From Fillmore Slim to Goldie, Pretty Toney
Frank War told me, C.C. get that money
My potentials, credentials, my mouth stay hot
Like Chinese mushrooms, wasabi with spicy lentils
The other day I brought a little gat, where I keep near my lower back
Cause these niggas don't know how to act
At the Apollo, Ray Charles told me
Bitch just get in the car, cuz I want you to swallow
I jumped in, and his bodyguards follow
He was quick, I spit the nut on his '74 wallos
He wanted to invite me to Chicago, I said 'nah, daddy'
He pushed me out and lit up a Marlboro
(Nah, papi) Cause I'm from New York
He taught me the talks, he taught me the walk
Cause I'm Chipp's bitch, we dine and resort
Only nigga ever taught me, don't put swine on my fork

And that's the truth, rest in peace, papi
This Cookie, I still got another tall Goose for you daddy
I'm a stick in the grave for you, baby
Fuck them other pimps, they ain't got shit on you, daddy",Pimpin' Chipp
Raekwon,"Yo, behind those mahogany walls
Indoor pools with steel doors, flipping eggs over in my silk drawers
While I""m charging my cell, sparking the L
Baby mother reading my mail, just that they switched seats
To another jail, and his banger is old fire
He's locked up with them dudes from the fucking Wire
That's when I passed her the bone, started to cough
And flossed all through the house, robe on, rugger out
Homebuyers see the sign, yeah y'all, I'm moving out
In front of the crib, niggas flipped, I had to shoot it out
Thirty G, living room sets, porcelain plates
With big giant wall units, even the front grass
Saw your boy doing it, Tone Stark he'll never fall
I even put work in, under the floor
In the box with the ox, and my skeleton jaw
Tell 'em soldiers I'm in the bush if the President call

[Chorus]
Get 'em, the'll be nothing but smooth sailing
When the heat shot, now your crew's bailing
I refuse to bow down, refuse to lay down
Go five and turn, to let the biz, all I found

Man I thought we told y'all niggas before, Wu-Tang is for the children
P.O.'s violate your dirty urine
These dealers in the lobby of my building, ice grilling
I don't catch cold to catch feelings
I put in that work, then catch millions
If that don't work, back to stealing
Snatch me a purse, and stack real in
Meth, I'm that dealing, millionaire, slash chameleon
I mastered the juks, one of my niggas ""Masta, killing""
Spray shots, clap civilians at the dealing table
Off of the love of crack dealing
Once again the fatal, flying guillotine, the millions
Paper rob me able, my woman is all pre-matul
I got mouths to feed, nigga, and I'm the hand that rocks the cradle
Just like Hova, but I ain't trying to 'roc' the label
I'm a soldier, I stay on job, me, eye a coka
Honey's wanna fuck and the industry fucks 'em over

[Chorus]

I got my Ghostface on, cause, I'm a Killah
I live the Streetlife, why, I'm that nigga
Label me a beast, call me U-Godzilla
When I rumble in the jungle, I go gorilla
Step on the set, Inspectah Deck you
Dead in your face, straight RZArect you
You highly mistaken, I'm hotter than Satan
Catch me in the kitchen with blood on Chef apron
I'm known to, Cap a Don, big gun in my palm
I'm like my arm is gone, plus I Masta the Kill
Give you something, you can really feel
Got many Methods to kill a Man, if it's real, you real
The world's worse like Dirt McGirt
Fuck a bitch raw dog, then dig in her purse
Yeah that boy's a Genius, I stay fresh like I'm straight out the cleaners
I walk hard like a criminal, holding my penis

Raekwon,"For the city, to get this money, Vegas, yo, yeah

Here's the rundown, Mustafa's getting money out in Youngstown
Get some goons together, a driver and bring them guns down
Heard he had his hands in some bricks, plus a few pounds
Hang with some wild Haitians, settle shop in the dude lounge
Niggas is migrating, he came from Cue Gardens
With a live situation, got it in preparation
When you get there, pick up the whip with the navigation
And follow all the clowns til you get to your destination
(We here Tone, got our masks on, we bout to run up in
I know you ain't talking bout the house, with the broken henge
65 Alpine Drive, it's looking shady
So I hopped out, pulled the glock out, plus the 3-18
Hit the living room, I've seen a ripped up sofa, a shattered coffee table
Broken lamps, and a flipped up stroller
The place was ransacked from front to back)
Yo, Trife, what you talking, black?
(Yo, Starks, cut the bullshit and tell me, where the office at)
Take a left and head, down the hallway steps
Pass the painting on the wall, the third door on the left
The safe is on the wall above the fireplace near the decks
Look inside the top drawer, and get the key out the chest

Damn son, aiyo what's taking this nigga Trife so long (I don't know)
Oh shit, yo Bull, get down, get down, get down
Look at Stark pulling up, son (aw man)
I'm a try to kill this nigga

Aiyo, hurry up I see a car pulling up, windows tinted
Can't really tell who's in it, but, I know it's a rented
Down south plates, Atlanta or, one of them states (yo the cameras on)
Man, I wanna see what's up in those crates
Should I pop off, take his top off, before he get to you
Bully like (Yo, chill, chill, this is what we gon' do) aight
(Go ask for directions, right, I'm a go around the back
Wait for them to come inside, I'll hit these niggas with the mack)
OK, before it even get to that, let me see where Trife is at
Hopefully he on his way, and no one gotta die today (bang bang)
Two shots go off (Homey trapped inside, quick put the mask on, Sheek)
Fuck it, Bully, let's ride
Shooting out the sunroof, missing and shit
I was too high, still think my Dutchie was lit

Chef that fly with a meat cleaver, swing on a young nigga
Smack flames at him, no gun neither
Leave him with a bump, what the fuck

Who give a fuck if he's a swordsman, I'm a gunman, I run from nothing
Chain came from rent days and pumping
Wire cell with valors on, drawers is colorful
I do this, forever nigga, raw style
Lighting Phillies, fly by willies, can't come through
Unless your vehicle three hundred chain, silly
Laying in the park with the killas, the coupes, the villains
No rims, we just ball for the millions

High power ninjas who touch you, lay a gun on
Drinking with the best of the hustling

Come through huddling, run through the spot thirty times
All my niggas old school robbers, do what it do

Can't come through with cedar toasters

Your heart get tested, and gunplay is only an investment

You already know that, man
Diamoned up, double O sevens, come through, 1-8-7
Back to the Hill in a second, yeah
Sons jump in front of them bullets, push me up in the bullet
Stay cool, I got shit, where ya weapon?
Hurricane slammers, earthquake clips and cannons
Back of the building, with the jammers

Go downs is like blow hounds, we smother the block
Jumping in front of cars, lending niggas four pounds
Walk, keep it moving, yo, hop in the range
I know you real, cause I raised you, not gon' front on your aim
We spit together, rocking wrist lights, stunting,
Right in front of the parking lot

Rock a bandana knife like Rambo on the scrambler

With an iron fist of fury and a mighty sword
To fulfill the prophecy of the Wu-Tang, of the Wu-Tang

In the Polo store, fronting in war clothes, it been like this
From right in time when I was nine years old
I was a hot mess, smoking cheeba, running with stolen speakers
Dropped beepers, even wore a victory vest
I run with niggas, digging knots from niggas, running out the school
Stunting, back of the bus, flashing the ox
Rock the V-Gooses, everything we wore was name brand
Sold three looseys, just to get on call plan
R.E.C. Poss' Rockers, the Blip Brothers
Even the Spin Doctors, sat and smoke blunts, I been bopping
All my kins blew up, we grew up with
We used to do what? Running through the sewers and then shopping
Pick pocket, deuce baby, take it in truce, baby
You know how we do, come run in my boots, baby
The niggas came through, touch the God, here Shallah
Ever since went from ninjas to gem stars, sing Ra

Reunited, another LP, we're all excited
That reckless eyeballing will get your girl indicted
My touch like Midas, I cramp your style, arthritis
These niggas is food, I eat they food, nigga-ritis
Your man don't snooze, insomniac
This The W, the Clan don't lose, you putting hands on who?
Hands down, I can handle you, you half man, half animals
If you are what you eat, and eat pussy, you's a cannibal
And stopping me, is what you cannot do
Either get in the game, get out the way, or get ran right through
I ain't different Method Man like you
But you ain't like us, we play rough, my community tough
And little kids in my community cuss
Y'all be showing your guns, but the ones in my community bust
And when they do, you give the jewelry up

My wallet got flowers on it, kill it cowards
From the land, the stolen land, where gold chains control a man
Three hundred holding hands, stolen grams
I play the phantom, waving,
Leave that nigga for dead, or should I save him
Spitting out phlegm, no, just grave them
I remember days, I used work for niggas, eat jerk with niggas
Buying whip, is laughing and joking, trying to flip
Clip is loyal, fly spoil on the block, display royal
Even though we go back to royals, black oils
Live as ever, can't tell me nothing, whatever
This thing of ours, is empowered by my niggas who pumping
Twenty four hours of slang motion, wave brush
Ya knew my hair was the ocean, running through the building
Just negation, some of the creeps
Knew me very well, knew he would sell, knew he was potent

OK, bridges I burn some, lessons I learn some
Money, I spent some, lent some, earn some
My eyes tell it, tell her the hell I return from
Spark up an L from the homeys I haven't heard from
Burn when the herbs come, I'm living large
Never chilling on the curb, just a villain on the verge, son
My tenth shot is as efficient as the third one
Second one, first one, worse come to worse run
When I was pushed out the womb, the Earth spun
The only way to describe this is inertia
Some rappers think they can try me, who the first up?
I don't guarantee no survivors, niggas, surf's up

She copped it from me, bought it in Rwanda

Throw you in the rassle, yo, clap ups
Catch me at the Stephen King mansion, with four of my Branson niggas
With me, me and Britney, a dancer
Know your shit authentic by the way your hat fit on you, with it
I'm like the Blair Witch nigga in the rented
Curtains in the five-seven, chunky and short
Bagging dope up in the backseat, your packages walk

Still gritty, leave the pretty to the females
The watch mother pearl weather seashells
Pick of the litter, have this nigga picking paper up
Twitter thug, I'm the Townline strangler
Get 'em up, banging dangerous as angel dust
Cuban Linx smoking stink in the Brink's trunk
I run with killas who snort powder, extort cowards
Ankle monitors under garments, so fuck showers

Sparking purple once a nigga done spaghetti slurping

Bought a Dairy Queen in Queens right next to Lowe's

Bubble baths, hash, zooted up, eyes closed
Silk drawers, fronting in my key lime pie Wall-o's
And I still got a half a key indeed, Frank Lucas shit
Hidden in coffins, flying over seas
And if you ever try to ruin my night
I'm a make sure my best pawn put like three in your kite
Shot caller, laying in big laws

Kinda brief from the gold teeth era,
Bro dreaming on C.R.E.A.M.

Scarf rap, pair of Timberlands, beat
This the potion, roll the scroll out, speaked and another walked in
Knowing now this is a thief
We from the same voc's, this is like a pot roast
Hottest niggas who rhyme, I know them from the time,
This is not 'posed to happen
Peace Black, we wasn't cool
Threw the piece back, everything good, I lit the leaf, captain
Got a mission, to make sure the world recognize our position
I'm standing near the kitchen
Shit just might work, I lit the stink, this could be the realest shit
This could be the realest flip quick
Everybody stand up in militant, army jackets down
I said to myself, this the realest clique

His face was pale, I looked at him kneel
Just wanna talk, you a deer, starting chasing him
He jumped in the tree, had grass in his ear
I'm a kill you nigga, you gonna have to come down

They poked him twice, his gear was ripped
Ninja style, niggas whipped him with a Benz belt, broke his arm
Crushed his Audemars with whelps
On his face, they was slappin' him, fake ass rapper

Quit playin', listenin' to Sid and them

Fishcakes, bubblegum shrimps in his Timbs
He had 12 and a half on, only wore 10

All that hard, no damn frame, how you playin'?
Thought you bubble with the big Willies, flyin' in fast cars
And get busy, now he sittin' there lookin' dizzy

Let me tell y'all a story, man
Listen man, from here

I'm tired of fishscale wars stayin' in all green
New Balance sneaker, white wranglers on the scene
We was youngsters, 80's babies getting in shit
Stolen cars, fell from monkey bars, flippin' and shit
Little thieves fresh out the P's
Broke heads is sled, slidin' through, two' five in my sleeves
Eggs and cheese, young niggas, by any means
We was saved watching Malcolm and Martin
Hold them things police, freeze, niggas is jettin'
No time for off track bettin', we was wetting niggas
Take these gunshots, sippin' rum shots on the roof
Hibernating blow with ease
Better needs, the father seeds
Cutting school, dippin' but truancy Ds
Influenced me with trees
Blue and cream, sat back, all I know is how to dream
Check the theme, watch the playboys run with kings

Now it's all about good livin', raising my children
I done seen the flames, escaped from the hell storms
Credentials of a high chief, blowin' on that potent broc' leaf
My old earth got a chance to see a black man run the white house
She shows her bright teeth, oh what a beautiful sight
But still some livin' strenuous through the struggles are unbearable
To ease the pain and eagerly seek the preacher for parables
To stop the rain and hoping somewhere to bring some sunshine I'm
Livin' proof that it's possible, any obstacle, you face it
Can be erased son, don't let it conquer you
Throughout my journey had some snakes in my past
But I couldn't let 'em strike me and catch the Devilish germ from 'em
But the lesson was valuable, yeah, I learned from 'em
If they ain't godly, they wicked, there's no concern for them
Know in a good space, more connections with more cake
Before I let some' come between a nigga I burn some'

Ayo
Burn some', kid
See if a man can flip himself inside out par
He fall out and die if you see all this shit that's going on man
It's real",Can't You See
Raekwon,"From shooters in buildings to coupes in the pavilions
Play wealth, keep your health and your heart first
The belt that's been passed on the last car collision and cracks
We was there rolling up, holding duffel bags, that's facts
Blood on his Fila's, crested Levi's
Laid there, two chains on, where's the throne
I was slick, like poets who know his shit, cold as shit
Thugs that stay loaded then blow throughout the global quick
Fast money and sneakers, cool out king silks on
Right in front of the Flash Gordon, you crabs goners
Stealin' styles so we taxed him out on Billy Childs
The bodies was ripped from water, twist the chalice
A grown folks game to the older folks
Grey haired gangsters rockin' New Balance
See the chodes, a few challenges
Money spill, heads tumble, thugs rumble, drugs crumble
But still I'm still upon in bankers trust, thankin' us
Preparing my speech, pulled up in a peach Corniche
Seats are burgundy, soccer gear and Louis cleats
Hand me my medals, pussy he just laughin' at us
I know you wanted my bitch, but money won't attract her
They trained, pullin' pistols see the aims
It's desert shark, that blow apart flesh and bones when it starts
The originator, Cuban linx chains, diamonds and clarks
Swim on this crime wave where bags of money get washed

They say Loyalty's golden and it will make you rich
Well, I'm royal, my cloth is purple, I never switch
High chief, low eyes and hella jewels

Getting money is easy, keeping it that's the hard part
Creeps and scavengers roam the land, call 'em aardvarks
Go ahead and try me now, filthy rich Africans
From the slums' glorious days, I bring the action in
Long hair Brazilians love swallowing my children
Self made poet, poetry constantly bringin' millions in
Scratch that small talk, meetings with the higher ups
Walls necessary, cemetery bitch and bury chumps
Spark up a branch and sip the champagne for the pain
Let's celebrate, this duffel bag snatch your dime piece bag another coffin though
From the era where the code is 'never trust a hoe'
My advanced stride is the coldest, yo
Ritual's get the bread and stay upon your square
For the leeches and the sly foxes please be aware
'Cause they will pray upon your shortcomings
Jeopardize the family's heir

Raekwon,"April 2nd 1939, the stars is in line
Divine intervention at it's own intention
Birthed a gift
In this DC kid
He sung heavenly
Good values and all
And his father was in the ministry
God fearing man with a mother that's so beautiful
The angels would serve her
What's her name?
It's Alberta
This little boy quickly became a man
From blowing in his father's church
To making his own band
Called the Moonglows
Sensational with his vocals
That drove the ladies crazy
Panties got thrown at his shows
But he was far from happy
He wore a smile just to hide it behind them doors
Him and his father constantly colliding

Marvin, the sound of your voice
Sets fire my soul
What a glory to be hold
Marvin, my heart, my heart still wonders how
I just hope you're happy now

Destined for greatness
Counting his blessings
Young'uns struggling with pressures
That the fact that his pops was a cross dresser
But he still loved him
You know the bond between his son and father
That only pushed him and forced him to sing harder
His main man Harvey Fuqua gassed up his car
Believed his sound
And took him down to Motown y'all
That's where it all happened
Success in the palm of his hand
But unfortunate the fame wasn't enough
He wanted more out of life
Took it further and found himself a wife
Pretty Anna Gordy
She made his time sit still
She was the cousin of Barry G
The founder of Hitsville
Please pay attention because the story it gets ill
Shit's real
Trials and tribulations son's facing
You gotta play the cards you're dealt
Ain't no telling what life deals
Death will cause you to have night chills
Enough to keep a nigga bothered
Especially when the negatives start coming from your father

Marvin, the sound of your voice
Sets fire my soul
What a glory to be hold
Marvin, my heart, my heart still wonders how
I just hope you're happy now

Money, women and drugs came into play
Now wouldn't you know
There goes another happy home down the drain
That night life had him speeding through hell
Scarred by the death of Tammy Terell
Couldn't believe it, he spiraled downhill
Secluding himself
From the music and the press
He was sick and really getting depressed
Time passed so he bounced back on track
New and improved
Even got himself a new wife too
Everything is on the up and up
Got his act together spiritually he claims
You could see the glow up on this fella
Tried to make amends with his father
But the hatred is too strong
Revolver in his palm
The warning that death was close
His mother screaming out ""Honey don't do it!""
One shot to the chest made Marvin lose fluids
April 1st he died on the spot
The scene was so horrific
How a father could kill his own son
Defines wicked

Tinha de fundo estampado um céu azul ensolarado
Igual desenho de televisão
Mas a realidade é diferente o sol quando aparece
É de torrar a mente e vários passarinhos
Partiram pra outros ninhos pra viver longe da gente
É o ser humano construindo
Destruindo tudo o que se vê pela frente
Seu egoísmo é algo tão doente
Pode ser falta de um amor presente

Die Kellner alle gleich-gleich groß, gleich blass und edel
Niemals wirst du hier von menschlichem Ballast umgeben
Im Club läuft Krieg in der Regel nur so:
Ne Unterschrift auf 'nem Papier entscheidet häufig über Leben und Tod
Im Club hat jeder 'ne Uhr, doch keiner achtet auf die Zeit
Beachtet wird die Marke und der Preis
Bist du King im Crown Club, hast du Macht und Eifer
Doch bricht der Club zusammen, bleibst du leider arm und einsam

Interessiert mich 'n Dreck zuviel Theorien

Ich ignorier den Wettlauf, halt davon eh nix
Will lieber Weltraumjumpen wie Felix

Während jeder meiner Gegner bei Facebook rumstalkt
Man erntet was man sät und sät man Unkraut

Ey, ey, auch wenn ich weiß, dass gerade nichts perfekt ist
Mit dir ist es Killer, denn du killst die Hektik
Mit dir ist es immer- immer cool auch wenn ich Filme mit dir guck
Und wir lachen uns kaputt über Jimi-Jimi Blue yeah

Im Bett ne Kanone wie Romy
Doch mit dir kann ich abhängen so wie mit Homies
Ich schaffe meine Laster aus dem Weg und
Lösche alle anderen Girls aus meinem Facebook

Ich atme lila Rauch ein und puste ihn aus

Denn wir fahren unseren eigenen Film
Abends lade ich dich ein auf das perfekte Dinner
Morgens bringst du mir das Frühstück ans Bett, wie immer
Bei Kerzenschimmer chilln und trinken wir Tee
Den ganzen Tag haben wir geredet in deinem Lieblingscafé
Ich bin fresh gestylt, du aufs maximale aufpoliert
Wenn du den Raum betrittst erblasst jede Frau vor dir

The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Rafael Ferro,"Yo, Wyclef, It's time that I confess (Refugee Camp) to all the girls
(Don't do it, don't do it)
To all the girls I loved before
To all the girls I cheated on before
To all the girls I loved before

To all the girls I cheated on before, I tip my hat like Willie Nelson
You got pressure, take a sip of this Molson
Here's what happened, it wasn't my intentions
To fall into seduction while playing a temptation
I thought I had it figured out, but games don't last
The hourglass ran out, I got sprayed with the tear gas
Big men don't cry, hold my feelings inside
Stress brings me pain, I gotta hold my pride
When I see you with another guy, jealous thoughts of homicide
Call me selfish when I say Abraham has many wives
You say this is the 90's, either it's gonna be me or her
I found myself in a blur
Lookin' into the clouds thinkin' out loud
""I'm in love with two women, who is it gonna be now?""

To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive but never forget, so the past reappears, uh huh
To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive, but you still think that I'm a ho

Second verse is gonna hurt, based on a true life story
I got married at 24 in New Jersey
You know the feelings start nature take it's course
Two years later 'Clef gets a divorce
When I had the cold feet, I shouldn't've walked the altar
With Dionne Warwick, she could predict my future
Went with my feelings even though it wasn't right
Creepin' with my secret lover in the middle of the night
Back home, break of dawn, dinner's at the table
Thin Line Between Love And Hate is on cable
I'm lookin' at myself thinkin' out loud
""I'm in love with two women, who is it gonna be now?""

To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive but never forget, so the past reappears, uh huh
To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive, but you still think that I'm a ho

Hotel, (I'm not a) motel, Holiday Inn (you don't believe me though)
And if your girl acts up at the carnival, then you take her friend
Hotel, (I'm not a) motel, Holiday Inn (you don't believe me though)
And if your girl acts up at the carnival, then you snatch her friend

Break it down right here

One love, you're lucky to have one love
It sounds bugged, drinking wine from the same jug
One heart, one mind, one soul
She ain't a gold digger, she don't care about your bank-roll
Keep your money, she make her own cheddar
All she want from me is respect like Aretha
Cooked me lasagne, stayed in for the winter
Chilled to the summer, now I'm gone 'til November
Have you seen her?
I think I did
But what I did wrong was take a love for granted
Cause first comes trust, don't rush into lust
Easier said than done, I lust and I must
Passion is a must, but then we start to cuss
We was just makin' love, now we tearing up each other's guts
Like species, she called me an animal
So feel the tongue of the warm-blooded mammal

To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive but never forget, so the past reappears, uh huh
To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive, but you still think that I'm a ho

I'm not a ho
(You don't believe me though)
I know you're diggin' this
Is it OK if I play my guitar right about now, is it alright?
(You don't believe me though)
Alright (you don't believe me though), alright
People in the back, is it OK if I play my guitar right about now?
Alright, alright, alright, alright
People on the side, is it OK if I play my guitar right about now?",To All the Girls

Raffi,"There are lots of things for me to do
On my way home, I'll tell you a few
I can watch a squirrel climb up a tree
Or make a buzz like a bumblebee
And that's what I might do today
On my way home

When it's pouring, and it rained outside
Sometimes I wanna stay in and hide
But with boots and raincoat, I'm okay
Splashing in the puddles, don't get in my way
'Cause that's what I might do today
On my way home

When it's cold and snow is on the ground
I can go to the hill and slide right down
Make a snow angel or build a snowman
Have some hot chocolate and do it again
And that's what I might do today
On my way home

And when it's hot I'm in sneakers and shorts
I can play tag or build some forts
I can walk alone or with my friends
Making up a song that never ends
That's what I might do today
On my way home
Yes that's what I might do today

Raffi,"Joshua Giraffe was born in a zoo
He lived there, too, for two years
And a half he hasn't had a bath
My mommy doesn't lick me
Even when I'm sticky from
Candy floss, candy apples, popcorn
Soft drinks, jelly beans and gumdrops
And there must be something better
Than living in this cage
But I'm really not too sure
Because I'm rather short of age

Joshua Giraffe was feeling kind of sad
Things were going bad
How little of life he had
Wasting away with no room to play
Trapped in a zoo with buffalo poo
So he went next door to the elephant
And asked him what to do
I'm wasting away with no room to play
I'm trapped in a zoo, with buffalo poo
The elephant was very old and gray
And he had a huge balloon bottom
He said, Never fear Joshua
A vision will appear

That night a dream came to Joshua and
Joshua saw animals, like crazy monkeys
And a whole pile of
Hippypotostropasuses
And flitty moths, frogs size twelve
And sleazy lizards
And a tribe of nasty saviars
But Joshua wasn't afraid
Because he sang himself this song

Nothing can go wrong-o
I'm in the Congo
Nothing can go wrong-o
I'm in the Congo
Nothing can go wrong-o
I'm in the Congo
Nothing can go wrong-o
I'm in the Congo
Nothing can go wrong-o
I'm in the Congo
Nothing can go wrong-o
I'm in the Congo

Even in his dream he knew
He'd never get away
Not even for a day
Then a peanut hit him on the nose
Joshua Giraffe was back in the zoo
What could he do
Awakened from his dream
He'd never be the same
Because of things he'd seen
He'd seen
Alligators, crocodiles, tree sloths
Anacondas, cobras and
Large winged moths
Orangutans, baboons eating grapes
Gibbons, rude mandrills and just plain apes

But Joshua was lucky
He had some special friends
And that day they went to the zoo
But he was up tight so they waited till the night
And they chopped his cage in two
He discovered he could fly and
He soared into the sky with them
Wrapped around his neck
And they haven't come back yet
So if you see them get a net

That's right, they haven't come back yet
But when they do, they say they are
Going to free all the animals from their cages
No matter how new or modern
Even some pets, too
So if on your way home today
You happen to find

A baboon basking in the balcony
Or a lion licking a lemon in the lobby
Or a python perched in the pantry
A wildebeest in the W.C
With a turtle twirling in your tub
Don't be afraid, just say you're a friend
Of their friend

It's taken flight with the wings I've worn

I had a fate that was owed to me
I didn't know what I was looking for

It was meant to be perfection
I could see it, a reflection of everything I've learned
Cards played, hands shaking
But until you've lost your nerve felt the road swerve out from beneath
You can't feel the piece of feeling stationed
I found you after a lifetime of searching
But after the lifeline is caught comes the working
'Til it's gone wrong, it can never go right
'Til you been blind you can't recognize sight
You can't fight the rain
Better get to like the rain
Clear skies right now
But tonight the rain will fall down
Drink the rain grow tall a flinch and drink away
You'll fall prey to the water

I should've known that I could still be saved

Tell the press that we can't say more,
There's nothing that we know 'bout for sure.
What has happend to our machines?
We found no wrecks and nothing was seen.

Fourteen men are lost anywhere,
There's nothing we can do for them there.

They're missing too, it seems as if we're cursed.

Many ships and planes we miss
In this part of the Atlantic.
IN the Bermuda triangle
Magnetic fields are disturbed sometimes.

Maybe that's a reason, but
Who knows what really happened there?
Is the flying dutchman real,
Are they transferred from space and time in another sphere?

Drowned in the sea, some thousand years ago
We searched for ages for the place
But no one yet has found a way through the haze, no

Myths and legends wind 'round treasure there to find
A whole civilization died
And all they knew, it sunk with them in their grave

The scientists found out some theories about
An earthquake dragged it all away,
Maybe this was meant in tales 'bout the flood...

The earth has changed its face and took our fruits away
We know, the people there were wise
Was mankind's cradle lost before our time?

Mayday, mayday!
Mayday, mayday!
Without a trace Atlantis drowned into the sea
Without a trace Atlantis drowned into the sea

Last night when I drove home they were there, this is true
They hung in the air above the motorway
Then they came down to me
A phosphorising light piercing me and the
Time, it stood still on the motorway
Then they came down to me
A phosphorising light piercing me and the time, it stood still

I've heard from a neighbour, he saw them at home.
They stood before his window watching him, so
Maybe they first want to study our life,
Yeah, they study our life.
Before they get in contact with us they must know who we are.

Do you know 'bout the U.F.O.'s
Maybe there's more life than we know
What comes now? I am eager to know,
Will they come back and clear our doubts?

Without a trace they came and left us in a mess
Without a trace they came and left us in a mess

Turning sleepless in her bed.

Or if she dies for my victory?

Their weapons made by our hands
If it's sure I've lost already
Now I hear my wife, she's calling
Don't leave me, don't leave me now

It was the year of madness and insanity.
There was no other cure for my disease
The overdose - I took it Rcause I had to flee,
It was nearly a journey that had no return,
The fever burned, I was gone - delirium.
There I was striding to heaven and they were calling me
From beyond and I heard : ³Dont look back !²
But I did and my eyes, they can¹t forget that sight
Rcause all water and land was dead.
Destroyed, denied, all tears undried,
The crawling chaos comes,
The twilight died, eternal night,
The crawling chaos comes.
A giant maelstrom, absorbing what we¹d left back,
The desert of cadaverous, mortal loam
And jungles of decay and decadence, where once
Had been the homelands of my people,
Temples of my ancestors, they were gone, dead and gone
Then the cracks in the ground, they were breaking up
And all water was streaming in,
Manifesting the sight of the dead Berlin
And London and Paris were graves.

the smile on these lips don't seem right.

wipes a curl from your eye and kisses you goodbye, bye bye...

Leaves your soul and leaves your mind
and your broken eyes stay blind.

There is no love or hate, can't see no certain state I'm in.
And a fog has laid itself on my heart
Like this misty morning as this cloudy day begins.

Still I wonder should I be afraid
About what's happening and how long has it been -don't know.
Why did come this shadow in my head
Like I have lost my soul, like I'm alive but dead.

As I walk the streets I feel no fear,
Although I notice that there is no feeling anymore.
And I try to send my mind back to the times
When I was able to live something to the core.

Dark, dark as the grave, my heart is dead,
I'm just a slave to what they've said. (this decay)
Still I'm alive but I feel dead.

[The Expedition]

I broke up to find this place, find those from the elder race.
In this unknown desert land I was digging in the sand.
Found these ruins, blocks of stone, older than the Egypt ones.

Climbed in caves, unspeakable, far down in the planets depths.

There were these enchanted books, pages that I've known too well,
written by the aliens ‘bout the way their study's been.
They transformed through space and time in all kinds of living minds
learning this way everything how through times the culture's been.

And I imagined how it's been like traveling through a name less time.
And I remembered how I felt when I was
in a nameless time, in a nameless time...

Take me home from these cryptic vaults.
I wait for a sign from my own reality, I wait here
in a nameless time.

[Finding Out]

Although the most I knew I needed a final proof
if I'd been one of them. And then these pages came :

My written words! So I'd been here in one of them...

Take me back home from these cryptic vaults.
‘cause I've been alive in this strange reality,

release me from this nameless time.
Take me home from these cryptic vaults.
I'm cursed for all time in this strange reality,
release me from this nameless time...",In a Nameless Time

Is not getting through to me.

It vanished in haze,
I'm falling from the grace,
This is another of those days.
All vanished in haze, vanished in haze.

Bitter face, empty eyes.
There has been so many smiles.
But my lips - paralysed,
Poisoned heart and poisoned mind.

It vanished in haze...

Give me time, let me go,
There's so much I couldn't show.
Leave my will to the flow,
More to be as I will grow.

Remember how you've locked it up in lies.

They're coming back from far away,
They're coming back, they cannot stay.
So I will pray to purify my mind.

Wash my sins away,
Take my sorrow and pain.
Wash my sins away,
Dry my rears with your rain.
Scars from yesterday,
Make my sins, oh, please wash them away.

Live again through feelings
That have shattered all your trust,

Is burned into your heart.

The cost of my desire
Jesus blessed me with its future
And I protect it with fire

And march around
Don't dare take what you need
I'll jail and bury those committed
And smother the rest in greed
Crawl with me into tomorrow
Or I'll drag you to your grave
I'm deep inside your children
They'll betray you in my name

Sleep now in the fire

The lie is my expense
The scope of my desire
The Party blessed me with its future
And I protect it with fire

And the fields overseer

Rage Against the Machine,"Yo, I was a fiend before I became a teen
I melted microphone instead of cones of ice cream
Music orientated so when hip-hop was originated
Fitted like pieces of puzzles, complicated
Shot grabbed the mic and try to say, "" Yes y'all!""
They tried to take it, and say that I'm too small
Cool, 'Cause I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet
Back to the lab, without a mic to grab
So then I add all the rhymes I had
One after the another one, then I make another one
To dis the opposite then ask if the brother's done
I get a craving like I fiend for nicotine
But I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean?
I'm raging, ripping up the stage and
Don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and
Thought of, 'cause it's sort of, an addiction,
Magnetized by the mixing

You can't solve it, you silly rabbit
The prescription is a hypertone that's thorough when

Soon as the bass kicks, I need a fix
Gimme a stage and a mic and a mix
And I'll put you in a mood or is it a state of unawareness? 
Beware, it's the reaniamator!
A menace to a microphone, a lethal weapon
An assasinator, if the people ain't stepping
You see a part of me that you never seen
When I'm fiending for a microphone
'Cause I take it to the maximum, I can't relax see, I'm
Hype as a hypochondriac 'cause the rap be one
Hell of a antidote, something you can't smoke
More than dope, you're trying to move away but you can't, you're broke
More than cracked up, you should have backed up

This is the time and age of renegades

Since the Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece
Right down through the Middle Ages
Planet earth kept going through changes
And then no renaissance came, and times continued to change
Nothing stayed the same, but there were always renegades
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Paine
Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcom X
They were renegades of their time and age
The mighty renegades

We're the renegades of funk

We are the force of another creation
A new musical revelation
And we're on this musical mission to help the others listen
And groove from land to land singin' electronic chants like
Zulu nation

Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations

We're teachers of the funk
And not of empty popping
We're blessed with the force and the sight of electronics
With the bass, and the treble the horns and our vocals
'Cause every time I pop into the beat we get fresh

There was a time when our music
Was something called the Big Street beat
People would gather from all around
To get down to the big sound
You had to be a renegade those days
To take a man to the dance floor

For all the diamonds
They'll use a pair of clubs to beat the spades
With poetry I paint the pictures that hit
More than the murals that fit
Don't turn away
Get in front of it

Did ya lose it on the wall

So ok let's work it out
I'm not letting go
Yeah girl that's for sure
Won't catch me walking out
So ok let's work it out

[Jahaziel Verse]
Ones again here we go through that old procedure
You screaming its over between us but I don't believe ya
You such a diva, a drama queen
Girl why you blowing up like a Osama's been
What you want a argument well I ain't speaking
We come to far now and I ain't leaving
If we gotta problem let's get on top of it
We ain't gotta split we can conquer it
But we gotta quit over reacting
Imagine just last night we're romancing
First passion now we be clashing
I know what's happening you throw in a tantrum
As a man I'm making the first move
You know I never do nothing to blatantly hurt you
We got a situation to work through
But patients a virtue and baby it take two so

I'm not letting go
Yeah girl that's for sure
Won't catch me walking out
So ok let's work it out
I'm not letting go
Yeah girl that's for sure
Won't catch me walking out
So ok let's work it out
I'm not letting go
Yeah girl that's for sure
Won't catch me walking out
So ok let's work it out
I'm not letting go
Yeah girl that's for sure
Won't catch me walking out
So ok let's work it out

",Let's Work It Out
Raghav,"No need to say a word
Yeah girl it's so clear
Ooh I can read through those tears
That man just stole you from me
So what you're 'bout to say is my biggest fear
Last thing I needed to hear is
That you no longer love me

So today before you do what you've got to do
Can I make one last request of you
I need just one more night without the truth
So please say

No no, no no
Tell me how I got it wrong
No one could just come along
And take you from me
No no, no no
Tell me I'm losing my mind
Promise when you close your eyes
You're only dreaming of me

No need to say a word
Yeah girl it's so clear
Oh I can read through those tears
That man just stole you from me
So what you're 'bout to say is my biggest fear
Last thing I needed to hear is
That you no longer love me

So today before you step up to break my heart
Before you start picking my world apart
Just know that I will never stop you
I've been where you are

Before you do what you've got to do
Can I make one last request of you
I need just one more night without the truth
So please say

And take you from me
No no, no no
Tell me I'm losing my mind
Promise when you close your eyes
You're only dreaming of me

We used to spend our nights just dreaming alone
I guess that those days are gone
And I've forever lost you
I never thought that you would hurt me like that
I guess there's no turning back
Oh girl I'll always want you

So today before you step up to break my heart
Before you start picking my world apart
Just know that I will never stop you
I've been where you are

Before you do what you've got to do
Can I make one last request of you
I need just one more night without the truth
So please say

No no, no no
Tell me how I got it wrong
No one could just come along
And take you from me
No no, no no
Tell me I'm losing my mind
Promise when you close your eyes
You're only dreaming of me

No no, no no
Tell me how I got it wrong
No one could just come along
And take you from me
No no, no no
Tell me I'm losing my mind
Promise when you close your eyes
You're only dreaming of me

Is akhari raat mat rulana sanam

Ek pyar ka raag

Raghav,"Oh
Ooh

Well, I know we just met yesterday
But things feel oh so right
'Cause you always know just what to say
Or what is on my mind

Well, I feel I'll need a special way
To ask you to be mine
But I don't know when's the perfect day
What's the perfect time

Babe, you leave me confused
Don't know if I should let you know
Or wait it out girl
Wish I knew just what to do
I'm so confused

So girl, what you wanna see
Wanna see me get down on my knees
Wanna hear me beggin' baby please
Wanna feel me crying for mercy

Oh, girl
I wish, I knew your world
I think I'm losing my head
Over you girl

Well, I know that it maybe too soon
To know just what you'd like
But I wanna know what you've been through
What you want from life

It's so real the way I feel
So true, it's been so hard to find
Wanna know how you feel for me to
So I'll make up my mind

Babe, you leave me confused
Don't know if I should let you know
Or wait it out girl
Wish I knew just what to do
I'm so confused

So girl, what you wanna see
Wanna see me get down on my knees
Wanna hear me beggin' baby please
Wanna feel me crying for mercy

Oh, girl
I wish, I knew your world
I think I'm losing my head
Over you girl

Well, someone once told me
That you'll end up lonely
Don't let love ever pass you by
'Cause I've seen it happen to

People that matter to me
With my very own eyes
Maybe they were mistaken
And I should be waiting

For you to show me a sign
Or should I just let you know
That if I let you go
I'd wonder the rest of my life

So girl, what you wanna see
Wanna see me get down on my knees
Wanna hear me beggin' baby please
Wanna feel me crying for mercy

Oh, girl
I wish, I knew your world
I think I'm losing my head
Over you girl

So girl, what you wanna see
Wanna see me get down on my knees
Wanna hear me beggin' baby please
Wanna feel me crying for mercy

Oh, girl
I wish, I knew your world
I think I'm losing my head
Over you girl",So Confused
