Frank Sinatra,"Hands across the table,
 While the lights are low,
 Though you hush your lips,
 Your finger tips
 Tell me all I want to know.
 Hands across the table,
 Meet so tenderly,
 And they say,
 In their little way,
 That you belong to me.",Hands Across the Table
Frank Sinatra,"I'm confessin' that I love you,
Tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confessin' that I need you,
Honest I do, need you every moment.
In your eyes I read such strange things,
But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,
Saying ""can't we still be friends""
If you go, you know you'll grieve me,
All in life on you depends.
Am I guessin' that you love me,
Dreaming dreams of you in vain,
I'm confessin' that I love you, over again.",I'm Confessin'
Frank Sinatra,"I'm so blue, I don't know what to do,
All day through, I'm pining just for you
I did wrong when I let you go away,
For now I grieve about you night and day.
I'm unhappy and dissatisfied,
But I'd be happy if I had you by my side.

[Chorus:]
If I could be with you, I'd love you strong,
If I could be with you, I'd love you long,
I want you to know I wouldn't go,
Until I told you, honey, why I love you so.
If I could be with you one hour tonight,
If I was free to do the things I might,
I'm telling you true, I'd be anything but blue,
If I could be with you.
All dressed up but still nowhere to go,
How I wish that I could see a show,
But here I wait with no one to call me dear,
The one I love is many miles from here.
Central, give me one-two-three-four-J,
Oh won't you listen, little sweetie, while I say.

[Chorus:]
If I could be with you, I'd love you strong,
If I could be with you, I'd love you long,
I want you to know I wouldn't go,
Until I told you, honey, why I love you so.
If I could be with you one hour tonight,
If I was free to do the things I might,
I'm telling you true, I'd be anything but blue,
If I could be with you.",If I Could Be With You (One Hour Tonight)
Frank Sinatra,"Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue
My disposition, it depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes

Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am so what can I do
I'm happy when I'm with you

Sometimes I am happy other times I am blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the sky
If I can find that sun in your eyes

Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's because I love you
That's how I am so what can I do
I'm happy, so happy when I'm with you",Sometimes I'm Happy
Frank Sinatra,"Thou swell, thou witty, thou sweet, thou grand
Wouldst kiss me pretty? Wouldst hold my hand?
Both thine eyes are cute too, what they do to me
Hear me holler, I choose a sweet lollapaloosa in thee

I'd feel so rich in a hut for two
Two rooms and kitchen I'm sure would do
Give me just a plot of, not a lot of land
And thou swell, thou witty, thou grand",Thou Swell
Frank Sinatra,"You must have been a beautiful baby
You must have been a wonderful child
When you were only starting to go to kindergarten
I bet you drove the little boys wild.
And when it came to winning blue ribboms
You must have shown the other kids how.
I can see the judges' eyes as they handed you the prize
You must have made the cutest bow.
You must've been a beautiful baby
'Cause baby look at you now.

Does your mother realize
The stork delivered quite a prize
The day he left you on the family tree?
Does your dad appreciate
That you're merely supergreat
The miracle of any century?
If they don't just send them both to me.

You must have been a beautiful baby
You must have been a wonderful child.
When you were only starting to go to kindergarten
I bet you drove the little boys wild.
And when it came to winning blue ribboms

I can see the judges' eyes as they handed you the prize
You must have made the cutest bow.
You must've been a beautiful baby
'Cause baby look at you now.",You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby
Frank Sinatra,"The best of everything, that's (that is) what I wish you all
The best of everything, a Rembrandt (hanging) on your (the) wall
A yacht that wins you cups, skateboards with style and speed
Show dogs or loving pups, the pride of the pound or the pedigreed
I hope you win that prize, pass that blue ribbon test
I hope your good keeps getting better, til your better's best
With every wine you taste, with every song you sing
By now you may have guest, I hope you get the best of everything",The Best of Everything
Frank Sinatra,"How do you keep the music playing?
How do you make it last?
How do you keep the song from fading
Too fast?

How do you lose yourself to someone
And never lose your way?
How do you not run out of new things
To say?

And since you know we're always changing
How can it be the same?

And tell me how year after year
You're sure your heart won't fall apart
Each time you hear his name?

I know the way I feel for you is now or never
The more I love, the more that I'm afraid
That in your eyes I may not see forever, forever

If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day to make it better as it grows
With any luck than I suppose
The music never ends

I know (how do you keep the music playing)
The way I feel for you is now or never (how do you make it last)
The more I love the more that I'm afraid
(how do you keep the song from fading)
That in your eyes I may not see forever
(Keep the song from fading)
Forever

If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day to make it better as it goes
With any luck than I suppose
The music never ends",How Do You Keep the Music Playing?
Frank Sinatra,"Life is such a great adventure
Learn to live it as you go
No one in the world can censure 
What we do here below
 
Don't save your kisses, just pass them around
You'll find my reason is logic'lly sound
Who's going to know that you passed them around
A hundred years from today!
Why crave a penthouse that's fit for a queen
You're nearer Heaven on Mother Earth's green
If you had millions what would they all mean
A hundred years from today
So laugh and sing, make love the thing
Be happy while you may
There's always one, beneath the sun
Who's bound to make you feel that way
The moon is shining, and that's a good sign
Cling to me closer and say you'll be mine
Remember, darling, we won't see it shine
A hundred years from today

Frank Sinatra,"If I should lose you
The stars would fall from the sky
If I should lose you
Leaves would wither and die
The birds in May-time - they'd sing a mournful refrain
And I would wander around - hating the sound of rain
With you beside me
The rose would bloom in the snow
With you beside me
No winds of winter would blow
I gave you my love - and I was living a dream
But living would seem - in vain if I
(Hating the rain - if I)
(All is in vain if I)
If I ever lost you",If I Should Lose You
Frank Sinatra,"It's the wrong time and the wrong place
Though your face is charming, it's the wrong face
It's not her face, but such a charming face
That it's all right with me

It's the wrong song in the wrong style
Though your smile is lovely, it's the wrong smile
It's not her smile, but such a lovely smile
So it's all right with me

You can't know how happy I am that we've met
I'm strangely attracted to you
There's someone I'm trying so hard to forget
Don't you want to forget someone, too?

It's the wrong game with the wrong chips
Though your lips are tempting, they're the wrong lips
They're not her lips, but they're such tempting lips
That if some night you're free
Dear, it's all right
Yes, it's all right with me",It's All Right With Me
Frank Sinatra,"The music she moves to, is music that makes me a dancer
I brought her my wildest of dreams, and she came up with the answer
I leave behind a part of myself, whenever i leave her
But oh, when I'm back in her arms
She smiles and then i am home again

'Cause l.a. is my lady
She's always there for me
L.a. is my lady
She knows how to care for me
No lady's sweeter you know it the moment you meet her

I've been in love more times, than i care to remember
And love's kept me cool in July and warm in December
It may not have lasted, but each time i thought it was heaven
You name it, I've been there and back
Lookin' for someone who I'd be faithful to

L.A. is my lady
She's always there for me
L.A. is my lady
She knows how to care for me
She's good to me yeah she's good to me

And that's why
L.A. is my lady, L.A. is my lady
And you're lookin' at a man who doesn't ever plan to
Kiss his lady bye-bye",L.A. Is My Lady
Frank Sinatra,"Oh, the shark has pretty teeth dear
And he shows 'em, pearly white
Just a jack knife has Macheath dear
And he keeps it way out of sight

When that shark bites with his teeth, dear
Scarlet billows they begin to spread
Fancy white gloves though has Macheath dear
So there's never, never one trace of red

On the sidewalk, one Sunday morning
Lies a body, oozin' life
Someone's sneaking 'round the corner
Could that someone perhaps per chance be Mack the Knife?

From a tugboat, on the river going slow
A cement bag it is dropping on down
Yeah the cement is just for the weight dear
You can make a large bet Mackie's back in town

My man Louis Miller, he split the scene babe
After drawing out all the bread from his stash
Now Macheath spends like a pimp babe
Do you suppose that our boy, he's did something rash

Ah, old Satchmo, Louis Armstrong, Bobby Darrin
They did this song nice, lady Ella too
They all sang it, with so much feeling
That old blue eyes, he ain't gonna add nothing new

But with Quincy's big band, right behind me
Swinging hard, Jack, I now I can't lose
When I tell you, all about Mack the knife babe
It's an offer, you can never refuse

We got George Benson, we got Newman & Foster
We got the Brecker Brothers, and Hampton's bringing up the rear
All these bad cats, and more, are in the band now
They make the greatest sounds, you ever gonna hear

Hey Sookie Taudry, Jenny Diver, Polly Peachum, Old Miss Lulu Brown
Oh the line forms, on the right dear
Now that Macheath, I mean that man Macheath
Yeah he's bad, mercy mercy
Yeah he's badder than old Leroy Brown
You better lock your door, and call the law
Because Macheath's, that bum,
He's back in town",Mack the Knife
Frank Sinatra,"Did you say (that) I've got a lot to learn
Well don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Teach me tonight

Starting with the ABC of it
Getting right down to the XYZ of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight

The sky's a blackboard high above you
And if a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write ""I love you""
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear my love
Teachers shouldn't stand so near my love
Graduation's almost here my love
You'd better teach me tonight

I've played loves scenes in a flick or two
And I've also met a chick or two
But I still can learn a trick or two
Hey teach me tonight

I who thought I knew the score of it
Kind of think I should know much more of it
Off the wall, the bed, the floor of it
Hey teach me tonight

The midnight hours come slowly creeping
When there's no one there but you
There must be more to life than sleeping
Single in a bed for two

What I need most is post graduate
What I feel is hard to articulate
If you want me to matriculate
You'd better teach me tonight

What do you get for lessons
Teach me, come on and teach me, teach me tonight",Teach Me Tonight
Frank Sinatra,"Don't you know I'd work for you, I'd slave for you
Be a beggar or a knave for you
If that isn't love it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along 

Gladly move the earth for you
Prove my love dear, and it's worth for you
If that isn't love it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along 

With all the words dear at my command
I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you baby - come what may
My heart is yours - what more can I say

I would cry for you, even sigh for you
Tear those stars down from the sky for you
If that isn't love it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along 

Walk on burning coals for you
I would drive the Chrysler,leave the Rolls for you
If that ain't love it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along 

I would try to hit high ""see"" for you
I'd even punch out Mr. T for you
If that ain't love it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along 

There's not a thing that you can't ask of me
Go on, demand any task of me
If you want the moon or a lavaliere
All you got to do is nibble on my ear

I would rob, steal, beg, borrow, and lie for you
Lay my little body down and die for you
(If that ain't love - if that isn't love)

If that ain't love it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along",Until the Real Thing Comes Along
Frank Sinatra,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're ogling
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I would gladly surrender myself to you body and soul",Body and Soul
Frank Sinatra,"I know I said that I was leaving
But I just couldn't say good-bye
It was only self-deceiving
To walk away from someone who
Means everything on earth to you

You learn with every lonely day
I've learned, and now I'm (i've come) back to stay

Let me try again, let me try again
Think of all we had before, let me try once more
We can have it all, you and I again
Please forgive me or I'll die, let me try again

I was such a fool to doubt you
To try to go it all alone
There's no sense to life without you
Now all I do is just exist
And think about the chance I've missed

To beg is not an easy task
(but) pride is such a foolish mask

Let me try again, let me try again
Think of all we had before, let me try once more
We can have it all, you and I again
Please forgive me or I'll die, (please) let me try again",Let Me Try Again
Frank Sinatra,"How little we know
How much to discover
What chemical forces flow
From lover to lover

How little we understand, what touches of that tingle
That sudden explosion, when two tingles intermingle

Who cares to define
What chemistry this is
Who cares with your lips on mine 
How ignorant bliss is

So long as you kiss me, (and) the world around us shatters
How little it matters, how little we know
(How little we know, how little we know)",How Little We Know
Frank Sinatra,"They say the neon lights are bright
On Broadway 
They say there's always magic in the air 
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't have enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere

They say the women treat you fine
On Broadway 
But lookin' at them just gives me the blues 
How ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes
 
They say that I won't last too long 
On Broadway 
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home they all say 
But they get wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar

I won't quit till I'm a star

Frank Sinatra,"How insensitive
I must have seemed
When she told me that he loved me
How unmoved and cold
I must have seemed
When she told me so sincerely
Why she must have asked
Did I just turn and stare in icy silence
What was I to say
What can you say when a love affair is over

Now she's gone away
And I'm alone with the memory of her last look
Vague and drawn and sad
I see it still
All her heartbreak in that last look

Did I just stare in icy silence

What can one do when a love affair is over",How Insensitive

And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap!

Those eyes, those sighs, 
They're part of the tender trap

You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart, until your heart just goes wap!

Those trees, that breeze, 
They're part of the tender trap

Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather have nothing at all

Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather have nothing at all

Oh please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes and the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow

Frank Sinatra,"These are the blues
Nothing but blues

Oh, they say some people long ago
Were searching for a different tune
One that they could croon
As only they can

They only had the rhythm
So they started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what to use
This is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill way up on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
Until it was worn into a blue note

And then they nursed it
They rehearsed it
And then sent out that news
That the Southland gave birth to the blues

They nursed it
Then they rehearsed it
And then sent out that news
That the Southland gave birth to the blues",Birth of the Blues

And day by day, my love seems to grow

So, come what may, I want you to know

We had so much fun and now you're home at last

Give me five minutes more, only five minutes more
Let me stay, let me stay in your arms
Here am I, begging for only five minutes more
Only five minutes more of your charms

It was midnight Come to think of it
It was spring

And yet I know too well 
Some day you'll say goodbye 
Then violins will cry 
And so will I, Mam'selle

Frank Sinatra,"It was just a neighborhood dance
That's all that it was

It was like a masquerade ball
With costumes and all
Cause you were at the dance with me

It was just a ride on a train
That's all that it was
But, oh, what it seemed to be
It was like a trip to the stars
To Venus and Mars
Cause you were on the train with me
And when I kissed you, darling
It was more than just a thrill for me
It was the promise, darling
Of the things that fate had willed for me

It was like a royal affair
With everyone there

Frank Sinatra,"The boat rides we would take, the moonlight on the lake
The way we danced and hummed our favorite song
The things we did last summer I'll remember all winter long

The midway and the fun, the kewpie dolls we won
The bell I rang to prove that I was strong
The things we did last summer I'll remember all winter long

The early morning hike, the rented tandem bike
The lunches that we used to pack
We never could explain that sudden summer rain
The looks we got when we got back

The leaves began to fade like promises we made
How could a love that seemed so right go wrong?
The things we did last summer I'll remember all winter long

I've tried so to forget, at times I do, and yet
The memory of you lingers like our song
The things we did last summer, I'll remember all winter long",The Things We Did Last Summer
Frank Sinatra,"Darling, I'm so blue without you
I think about you the live-long day
When you ask me if I'm lonely
Then I only have this to say

You'll never know just how much I miss you
You'll never know just how much I care
And if I tried, I still couldn't hide my love for you
You ought to know, for haven't I told you so
A million or more times?

You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer
If there is some other way to prove that I love you
I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now

Frank Sinatra,"Wherever we may be along about this time of year, our
Hearts become sentimental pilgrims and head for home. 

Because home is where we all discover that 
Christmas is one time of the year when we don't have to be wealthy to be rich. 
Some of us remember Christmas as the time when Dad gave us our first gold watch. 
Others remember it as the time when a charity organization 
Delivered a Christmas basket to the doorstep before dawn, 
So the neighbors wouldn't see and Mother wouldn't be embarrassed. 

But whether the hearth that cheered your family was a
Fireplace of marble or a kitchen stove of cast iron, 
You'll remember that your home was the richest place on earth, 
Warmed by the richest spirit on earth, the spirit of Christmas.
 
And that's why I've chosen this next song to sing as a Christmas song. 
It's not a carol, it's just a beautiful pathway of friendly 
And understanding music up which our hearts may travel 
As they make their Yuletide pilgrimage goin' home.

Goin' home, goin' home
I'm a'goin' home
Quiet-like, some still day
I'm a'goin' home

It's not far, just close by
Through an open door
Work all done, care laid by
Goin'ta fear no more

Mother's there, 'spectin' me
Father's waitin', too
Lots of folks gathered there
All the friends I knew

One of the most precious gifts we have throughout the
Year is one we often forget, the precious gift of freedom. 
Freedom to work, to play, to worship as we please. 

Freedom to decided how we'll handle our own future, 
Cause we can make our future and that of our families a secure one though saving. 
We can buy Savings Bonds to take care of that new home or an education for our kids. 
No one says we have to buy 'em, we want to buy 'em, 
Cause they're not only an investment in our own future, 
They're an investment in the finest country in the world. 

So let me urge you sincerely, as we look toward a new year, 
To plan for making it a secure year, for the regular purchase of US Savings Bonds. 
So long, everybody, and Merry Christmas.",Goin' Home
Frank Sinatra,"Wrong, would it be wrong to kiss
Seeing I feel like this?
Would it be wrong to try?

With you forever?

Frank Sinatra,"When most us saddle up for the old trail for our last ride, we leave little
Enough behind to show that once we have camped here. Some leave more than
Others, some a memory and some a fortune, some a song. And a song can be as
Fine a memorial to a man as anything that can be left behind, 'cause you see

It's gold, and it's gold that all can share. We have a great song to
Remember Lorenz Hart by, that wonderful melody that he and Dick Rodgers
Wrote for the Connecticut Yankee, of course you know, My Heart Stood Still
I took one look at you, that's all I meant to do

And then my heart stood still,
My feet could step and walk, my lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still.
Though not a single word was spoken, I could tell you knew

That unfelt clasp of hands told me so well you knew
I never lived at all until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still.
(That unfelt clasp of hands told me how well you knew, hmmmm)

I laughed at sweethearts I met at schools
All indiscreet hearts seemed romantic fools
(A house in Iceland was my heart's domain)
(I saw your eyes, now castles rise in Spain!)

Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
He kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny - and his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a - stubborn streak

And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a pig

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He ain't got no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy - and extremely rude

But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig

Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish

A fish won't do anything but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
And to fool the people is his only thought
Though he slippery - he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish

And all the monkeys aren't in a zoo
Every day you meet quite a few
So you see it's all up to you
You can be better than you are
You could be swinging on a star

From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Shure, it looked so sweet and fair

For it looks so peaceful there""

From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth, goodwill to men, from Heaven's all gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing

Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its babel sounds the blessed angels sing

And He beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours, come swiftly on the wing
Oh, rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing
And hear the angels sing

To face unafraid of the plans that we made

with sweat,

I start getting' restless whenever I hear the whistle of a train
I pray for the day I can get underway
And look for those castles in Spain
They call me a dreamer
Well maybe I am
But I know that I'm burning to see those 
Far away places with the strange sounding names
Calling, calling me

Frank Sinatra,"Forever and ever
My heart will be true
Sweetheart, forever
I'll wait for you

We both made a promise
That we'd never part
Let's seal it with a kiss

Let bygones be bygones forever
We'll fall in love once again
So, let's tell the world of our new love divine
Forever and ever you'll be mine",Forever and Ever
Frank Sinatra,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have roused the Devil's wrath
'Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf
And you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party
But the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go thru life
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains
Everything happens to me

I never miss a thing,
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
I guess I'm just a fool
Who never looks before he jumps
Everything happens to me

At first my heart thought
You could break this jinx for me
That love would turn
The trick to end despair
But now I just can't fool
This head that thinks for me
So I've mortgaged
All my castles in the air

I've telegraphed and phoned
Sent an Air Mail Special, too
You answer was goodbye
There was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you
Everything happens to me

I've never drawn a sweepstake
Or a bank night at a show
I thought perhaps this time
I'd won but Lady Luck said no
And though it breaks my heart
I'm not surprised to see you go
Everything happens to me

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me
Frank Sinatra,"Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love
So how are they to know
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in",Fools Rush In
Frank Sinatra,"I let my heart fall into careless hands
Careless hands broke my heart in two
You held my dreams like worthless grains of sand
Careless hands don't care when dreams slip through
I brought you joy
And girl I loved you so
But all that sunshine didn't make the roses grow
If you don't change
Someday you'll know the sorrow of careless hands
That can't hold onto love

Where I'll find a field of gold,

And they say there's an isle deep with clover,
Where your heart wears a snile all day through.

But I know well they're wrong,
And I know where I belong,
And here I'll stay with you.

For that land is a sandy illusion,
It's the theme of a dream gone astray;
And the world others woo
I can find loving you,
And so here I'll stay.

You were dearer than dear to me
From the moment you came.
Evenings by your side, I learned to love the night,
But the loveliness of the night
Is no longer the same.

When day is done and shadows fall,
I dream of you.
When day is done, I think of all the joys we knew
That yearning returning to hold you in my arms,
Won't go, love, I know, love,
Without you night has lost its charms!
When day is done and grass is wet with twilight's dew,
My lonely heart is sinking with the sun.
Although I miss your tender kiss the whole day through,
I miss you most of all when day is done.
Vesper bells are ringing, somewhere far away,
There's a silvery star away
At the edge of the sky.
Work is done, and life is like a song to me,
For some treasures belong to me
That no money can buy.

When day is done and shadows fall,
I dream of you.

I live in memory among my souvenirs.
Some letters tied with blue, photograph or two,
I see a rose from you among my souvenirs.

And though they do their best to give me consolation,
I count them all apart and as the teardrops start,
I find a broken heart among my souvenirs.

You can bring Rose with the turned up nose, but don't bring Lulu.

When she struts her stuff around, London bridge is falling down,
You can bring cake or Porterhouse steak, but don't bring Lulu.

She's the kind of smartie who breaks up every party,
Hullabaloo loo, don't bring Lulu, I'll bring her myself.
We all went to the party, real hi-toned affair,
Then along came Lulu, wild as any Zulu,

She started into Charleston, and how the boys did stare, but

Still, the magic of the night I met you

And the clouds blow over and darken him

Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away

I watch 'til a star breaks through
Funny, it's not a star i see
It's always you

Whenever i roam through roses
And lately i often do
Funny, it's not a rose i touch
It's always you

If a breeze, caresses me
It's really you strolling by
If i hear, a melody

You dare me to be untrue

It's always you",It's Always You

Frank Sinatra,"A moment after dark around the park
An old-fashion gent comes parading
Dressed in funny clothes but singing as he goes
The Lamplighter's Serenade

The old boy loves to talk with couples on the walk
But when it's half after love time
He reaches for his sticks and from his bag of tricks
He lights every star in the sky

And if a lady or a beau should answer no
He sprinkles their hearts with his magic
Then he steals away to sing another day

One yesterday before I hid away in crowds,

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Just two lovers by a moonlit sea,
While I watched I thought of you and I tingled,
For they kissed the way you did with me.

Then the shadows on the sand came much nearer,

There was one familiar face showing clearer,
It was you, I couldn't look again.

Don't know what to call him but he's mighty like a rose!
Lookin' at his mammy with eyes so shiny blue,
Makes you think that heaven is comin' close to you.

Think I see the angels looking thro' the lace.
When the dark is falling, when the shadows creep,
Then they come on tip-toe to kiss him in his sleep.

You smile and this heart of mine betrays me

While we treasure every measure,
So that time can never change

We vowed our true love, though a word wasn't said 
The world was in bloom, there were stars in the skies 
Except for the few that were there in your eyes

Angels were singing a hymn to your charms 
Two hearts gently beating, murmuring low

The sun shone anew but the dance lingered on 
Could we but recall that sweet moment sublime 
We'd find that our love is unaltered by time

Brought the sun and the flowers

My lonely nights are through, dear

Skies above can't be stormy
Since that moment of bliss, that thrilling kiss

Romance on your menu

Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do, I thought about you

A boulevardier, the toast of Paris.
For over the noise, the talk and the smoke,
I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a jokeI walk in a room, a party or ball,
""Come sit over here"" somebody will call.
""A drink for M'sieur, a drink for us all!

Blossoms in the breeze,
That we walked among,
Lying in the hay,
Games we used to play,
While the rounds were sung,
Only yesterday, when the world was young.

2. Wherever I go they mention my name,
And that in itself, is some sort of fame,
""Come by for a drink, we're having a game,""
Wherever I go I'm glad that I came.
The talk is quite gay, the company fine,
There's laughter and lights, and glamour and wine,
And beautiful girls and some of them mine,
But often my eyes see a diff'rent shine.

Ah, the apple trees,
Sunlit memories,
Where the hammock swung,
On our backs we'd lie,
Looking at the sky,
Till the stars were strung,
Only last July when the world was young.

The laugh of the year, the night of them all.
The blonde who was so attractive that year,
Some opening night that made us all cheer.

I know how the lady in the harbor feels

When I want rain, I get sunny weather
I'm just as blue, blue as the sky
Since love has gone, I can't get myself together
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry

My friends ask me out, but I tell them I'm busy
I've got to get, got to get a new alibi
I hang around at home and ask myself, ""Where is she?""

Moving on a stream of dreams
My little memories, those little memories
Remind her of our crazy schemes

Then somebody says, ""Just forget about her""
And I gave that treatment a try
Strangely enough, I got along without her
Then one day she passed me right by, oh well
I guess, I'll hang my tears out to dry

Frank Sinatra,"I didn't know what time it was, then I met you
Oh what a lovely time it was, how sublime it was too!

I didn't know what day it was, you held my hand.
Warm like the month of May it was and I'll say it was grand.

Grand to be alive, to be young, to be mad, to be yours alone!
Grand to see your face, feel your touch, hear your voice say I'm all your own!

I didn't know what year it was, life was no prize.
I wanted love and here it was shining out of your eyes.

I'm wise and I know what time it is now.",I Didn't Know What Time It Was
Frank Sinatra,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh or two
A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go, darling
Before you can count up
One, two, three, four

There's a small hotel
With a wishing well
I wish that we were there together
There's a (no) bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to share together
Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who wants people?
When the steeple bell says
""Good night, sleep well""
We'll thank the small hotel together

Pretty window curtains made of chance
In a make-believe land
On the wall are several cheerful prints
Of Grant and Grover Cleveland
Look out into the parlor and feast your eyes
On the moose head on the wall
Perhaps you'd like to play the organ
They tune it every other fall
When the steeple bell says
""Good night, sleep well""
We'll thank the small hotel 
We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel

Something to make my heart beat much faster

You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.

And though they do their best to give me consolation,
I count them all apart and as the teardrops start,
I find a broken heart among my souvenirs.

Frank Sinatra,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine [From Jubilee]
Frank Sinatra,"These are the blues
Nothing but blues

Oh, they say some people long ago
Were searching for a different tune
One that they could croon
As only they can

They only had the rhythm
So they started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what to use
This is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill way up on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
Until it was worn into a blue note

And then they nursed it
They rehearsed it
And then sent out that news
That the Southland gave birth to the blues

But a cloud drifted over it's face
You kissed me and went on your way

I heard the song of the spheres
Like a minor lament In my ears
I hadn't the heart left to pray

Sad though his song

So, set 'em up, Joe, I got a little story you oughta know
We're drinkin', my friend, to the end of a brief episode

I got the routine, so drop another nickel in the machine
I'm feelin' so bad, wish you'd make the music pretty and sad
I could tell you a lot, but you've got to be true to your code
Just make it one for my baby and one more for the road

You'd never know it but buddy, I'm a kind of poet
And I got a lot of things I'd like to say
And when I'm gloomy, you simply gotta listen to me
Till it's talked away

Well that's how it goes and Joe, I know your gettin' pretty anxious to close
And thanks for the cheer, I hope you didn't mind my bendin' your ear

Frank Sinatra,"There's no business like show business like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing, everything that traffic will allow
Nowhere could you get that happy feeling when you are stealing that extra bow

There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Even with a turkey that you know will fold, you may be stranded out in the cold
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold, let's go on with the show

The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
Are secretly unhappy men because
The butcher, the faker, the grocer, the clerk
Get paid for what they do but no applause
They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye for anything theatrical and why?

There's no business like show business and I tell you it's so
Traveling through the country is so thrilling, standing out in front on opening nights
Smiling as you watch the theater filling, and there's your billing out there in lights

There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Angels come from everywhere with lots of jack, and when you lose it, there's no attack
Where could you get money that you don't give back? Let's go on with the show

(There's no business like show business like no business I know)
You get word before the show has started that your favorite uncle died at dawn
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted, you're broken-hearted, but you go on

Next day on your dressing room they've hung a star, let's go on with the show!",There's No Business Like Show Business [From Annie Get Your Gun]

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

When you did that to me

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

Where there is laughter, there is Barbara, always Barbara warm and gay.
And when there's music, she is the song, the song I'm singing my whole life long.
There's no one just like her, like Barbara, only Barbara is so rare.
Wherever she is, I'll be there.

Frank Sinatra,"I've tried to break the habit
But somehow I just keep waking up alone
There's something deep inside me
That refuses to believe you're really gone
And every night I fall asleep
By your side of this great big double bed
Remembering that the worst you ever gave me
Was the best I ever had
I know I should be sleeping
Like a kitten in somebody else's arms
But I lie awake remembering all the ways
We used to keep each other warm
I know that nothing's perfect but we came so close
How could it turned out bad?
But even so the worst you ever gave me
Was the best I ever had
How I missed your tender kisses
And the gentle arms that used to hold me tight
Oh they say that all good things must end
But endings always leave somebody sad
But I remember that the worst you ever gave me
Was the best I ever had
I can't forget the worst you ever gave me
Was the best I ever had",The Best I Ever Had
Frank Sinatra,"Blue lace, her gown was blue lace,
She wore the promise of springtime and laughter.
Daybreak, we talked till daybreak
Without a warning of what might come after.

Her touch was velvet, I still can feel it
That one brief moment that ended in space.
Sometime in mid-December,
I hear the music, the echo of springtime laughter,

All day I see the old days,
When I'd seen the young girls in blue, blue lace.
Her gown was blue lace, such lovely blue lace,
Her gown was blue.",Blue Lace
Frank Sinatra,"Rows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons ev'rywhere

But clouds got in my way
I've looked at clouds from both sides now

From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As ev'ry fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall

To say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained
In living ev'ry day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall

Frank Sinatra,"Singing carols, stringing popcorn
Making footprints in the snow
Memories, Christmas memories
They're the sweetest ones I know

Cookies baking in the kitchen
Cards and ribbons everywhere
Frosty, Christmas memories
Float like snowflakes in the air

And oh, the joy of waking Christmas mornings
The family round the tree
We had a way of making Christmas morning
As merry as can be

I close my eyes and see shining faces
Of all the children who now have children of their own
Funny, but comes December
And I remember every Christmas I've known

 meu comportamento de antimusical
 Eu mesmo mentindo Devo argumentar
 Que isto é bossa nova Que isto é muito natural

 O que você não sabe nem sequer pressente
 é que os desafinados também têm um coração

 Só não poderá falar assim do meu amor

Frank Sinatra,"Dry your eyes, and take your song out, it's a newborn afternoon.
If you can't recall the singer, you can still recall the tune.
Dry your eyes and play it slowly, like you're marching off to war,

From the center of the circle to the midst of the waving crowd.
If it ever be forgotten, sing it long and sing it loud.
Come, dry your eyes.
And he taught us more about giving than we ever cared to know.

But we came to find the secret and we never let it go.
And it was more than being holy, though it was less than being free,

Through the lightning and the thunder, to the dark side of the moon,

For the sight of skirts above the knees turns his hardboiled brain to tears.
And the scent of honey in the tree whets an old sweet tooth.

The pretty girls go strolling by, I smile at them, and heave a sigh.
And think of all the things I've missed, and all the pretty girls I've never kissed.

They smile from field of daffodils, they wave from high and windy hills,
In secret places by the sea, the girls I've never kissed still wait for me.

All the girls whose names I can't recall, their faces haunt me still,
All the pretty girls I've never kissed and never will.

The wrong shall fail, the right prevail

Frank Sinatra,"Should my heart not be humble, should my eyes fail to see,
Should my feet sometimes stumble on the way, stay with me.

Comes the darkness and the frost, I get lost, I grow cold.

And I go seeking shelter and I cry in the wind,
And though I grope and I blunder and I kneel and I'm wrong,
Though the rose buckles under where I walk, walk along

Or that I can do it, pray, stay with me.

I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenes

Let me be thrilled by all your charms

Within your arms

Frank Sinatra,"Somebody else told somebody else
And that somebody said we were through
But I don't believe in rumors, darling
I want it straight from you

Wherever I walk, the people all talk
And they're saying it's time that I knew
But I don't believe in rumors, darling
I want it straight from you

For everyone knows how a rumor grows
When the gossips are doing their worst
But somehow I feel if the stories were real
You would have come to me first

Whatever they say and say what they may
Still it isn't a thing you would do
So I won't believe in rumors, darling
I want it straight from you

Frank Sinatra,"I've had this feeling before but never like this
Love had me reeling before but never like this
Who ever dreamed this could happen
To someone supposed to be smart
I must have really been napping
To let you walked off with my heart

My dreams, and I had quite a few, were never like this
This is too good to be true, but so was that kiss
I know by the way my heart leaps
That this time I'm playing for keeps

Yes, I've had this feeling before
Darling, but never like this

The hip-hooray and ballyhoo, the lullaby of Broadway.
The rumble of a subway train, the rattle of the taxis,
The daffodils who entertain at Angelo's and Maxie's.

When a Broadway Baby says goodnight, it's early in the morning,
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight until the dawn,
Goodnight, baby, goodnight, milkman's on his way.

Frank Sinatra,"Maybe it's because the kiss you gave me, touched my heart and went right through.
I can't tell you why, I only know that I fell helplessly in love with you.
How I fell in love with you!
I could say you're grand and therefore I care for you so.
But there is a why and wherefore and I'd like to know.

Maybe it's because the star I wished on, made a certain wish come true.
Or it just should be that you were meant for me, and maybe I was meant for you.
Maybe it's because the song we danced to, told a story old and new.
I can't figure out just why it came about.",Maybe It's Because

Frank Sinatra,"When I take you out tonight with me, honey, here's the way it's gonna be,
You will sit behind a team of snow-white horses in the slickest gig you'll ever see.

Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry when I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top.
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters when I drive them high steppin' strutters,
Nosy folks will peep through the shutters and their eyes will pop.

Those wheels are yellow, the upholstery's brown, the dashboard's genuine leather.
With nice bright curtains that can roll right down in case there's a change in the weather.
Two bright side lights winking and blinkin, ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinking,
You can keep your rig if you're thinking that I care to swap
For that shiny little surrey with the fringe on the top.

(Would you say the fringe was made of silk?) Wouldn't have no other kind but silk.
(Has it really got a team of snow-white horses?)
One's like snow, the others more like milk (so you can tell `em apart)
All the world would fly in a flurry, when I take you out in the surrey,

When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top.
When we hit that road hell for leather, cats and dogs all dance in the heather.
Birds and frogs will sing all together and the toads will hop.
The wind will whistle as we rattle along, the cows will moo in the clover

The river will ripple out a whispered song, and whisper it over and over.
Don't you wish you'd go on forever, don't wish you'd go on forever,
Don't you wish you'd go on forever and would never stop
In that shiny little surrey with fringe on the top",The Surrey With the Fringe on Top
Frank Sinatra,"The light-hearted gay kind of charm you display, that's for me.
The wonderful sly little trick with your eye, that's for me.
What a feather in my hat if I could gratify your wish;
Do you like the movies, or what is your favorite dish?

The tilt of your chin, when you chuckle or grin, that's for me.
You might as well know that wherever you go, there I'll be
Just to make sure you keep your heart alone and fancy free.
No one else can have it; that's for me",That's for Me

For the moment I saw him I fell
 
""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine

Love may be a gravel or a two-ton truck
Regal as a sable or a Donald Duck,

But you must not avoid what is basic as Freud,
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance.
Love is real devotion or it's inhumane.
Still without emotion or a hurricane

So remembering this, when it's close as a kiss,
Take a chance, take a chance on love,
Here's your chance, grab that chance, here is love.",Take a Chance
Frank Sinatra,"Tell her you love her each day,

Frank Sinatra,"There goes that song again
We use to call our serenade
We fell in love when we heard it played
Over and over and over, over again

I still remember when
I sang the words and they made you mine
I'd steal a kiss and repeat each line
Over and over and over, over and then

We drifted apart, you walked off with my heart
It's funny how one listens, just starts me reminiscing
I'd soon forget that yen, I told myself
When you said, ""So long"", but I was wrong
There goes that song again

Till the wells run dry and each mountain disappear,

Like painted kites, those days and nights they went flyin' by
The world was new beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than a piper man, one day it called to you
I lost you, I lost you to the summer wind

The autumn wind, and the winter winds they have come and gone

And guess who sighs his lullabies through nights that never end

Everyone knew that the bells were broken and hadn't sounded for a long long time.
Then one night the village was astounded, for the bells began to chime.

Though the frost was cruel
When a poor man came in sight
Gathering winter fuel

Hither, page, and stand by me,
If thou knowst it, telling
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?
Sire, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes fountain.

Bring me flesh and bring me wine
Bring me pine logs hither
Thou and I shall see him dine
When we bear them thither.

Forth they went together
Through the rude winds wild lament
And the bitter weather

Sire, the night is darker now
And the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart, I know not how
I can go no longer.
Mark my footsteps, good my page
Tread thou in them boldly
Thou shall find the winters rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

Frank Sinatra,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!",Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! [Live]

These foolish things remind me of you

You came, you saw, you conquered me

I knew somehow this had to be

The winds of march that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

Frank Sinatra,"Oh, they say some people long ago
Were searching for a different tune
One that they could croon
As only they can
They only had the rhythm
So they started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what to use
That is how the blues really began
They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that
As part of the blues
From a whippoorwill
Out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'Til it was worn
Into a blue note
And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the Southland gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues [#]
Frank Sinatra,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

And these few precious days I'll spend with you

Frank Sinatra,"I can see a steeple, surrounded by people -
Oh how real it all starts to seem.
Just as the choir is singing, my alarm starts ringing.
It's the same old dream.
And then my thoughts inspire a scene by the fire,
In a cottage close by a stream.
I know it all by heart now - we're about to part now.
It's the same old dream.
If you but knew
How many times I pretend that I'm with you
I'm sure your heart would unbend.
You'd see me through
Until my dream had a happy ending
And I can picture clearly those things I love dearly -
In the center you reign supreme.
We kiss and I discover I'm a lonesome lover.

Just give me one like this
This is a lovely way to spend an evening
Can't think of anything I'd rather do
This is a lovely way to spend an evening
Can't think of anyone as lovely as you

A kiss by a lazy lagoon
Catching a breath of moonlight, humming our favorite tune

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove

Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon (Reprise)
Frank Sinatra,"Before we go on a lark,
I got one suggestion before we embark,
There are a lot of nice things to do in the dark,
But let's not go rowing in Central Park.
Woo, woo, woo.
We're going on the town, New York,
We're riding on a rocket, we're going to really sock it,
Because tonight's the night.
We're going on the tube,
We're going to raise a riot, the Brooklyn Bridge we'll buy it,
And hit the hype tonight, the highest hype tonight.
East side, west side, rouse the city,
One day, one night, that's the pity.
And we won't look ahead,
We'll let the light of dawn get around,
We're really living, Jack, we're going on the town.
Stop fellows, what are we saying?
Look over there, the fleet, doesn't she look sweet?
What did we leave it for? What are we doing on shore?
We're simply crazy about the navy, (how's that?)
We love it more than we can say, (how nice!)
We get like a good fresh air, (uh huh) the ocean's everywhere (uh hum)
That's we hate to get leave and go away.
(It's just so touching, hear them say, take your leave and go away)
(Can't even leave the ship when life is play all the live long day)
Just think of what could we be doing today:
We could be swabbing the deck, sweeping the bunks with a broom,
We could be shoveling tons of coal, down in the boiler room.
Bad news, we got the shore leave blues,
(It just so tragic, hear him sob,)
(He would freak on a tricky spot

Pour on the happy night,
We got news, we have the shore leave blues,
Especially me, I miss the chow,
And that's not all, my friends, just think of this:

A bunch of merchandise, 
The all-American Cow wins the prize. 
Your All-American man is nice young man, 
He is a handy man in a pinch, 
Maybe he can't make love 
Like a clam who can, 
Till he gets his gal in a clinch. 
All-American Man may not get what he wants, 
For the All-American Girl wears the pants. 
Like the flag on the little red schoolhouse 
Like the ball on election day, 
Like a brass spittoon, and Daniel Boone, 
It's strictly USA. 
That is to say Bud! Down South it's hi-all, 
Cowboys say Howdy, Indians say How 
No matter where you're meeting folks. 
It's the real American way of greeting folks.

Like Mr. Tambo and Mr. Bones

That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul
A certain rhythm that you can't control
And you will do the Continental all the time
