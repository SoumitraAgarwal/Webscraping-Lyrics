Synthesizer Rock Orchestra,"You can dance
You can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl
Watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music
Getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music
Everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet
Only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine
You can dance
You can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl
Watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen

You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another
Anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet
Only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine
You can dance
You can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl
Watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen",Dancing Queen
Synthesizer Rock Orchestra,"Can you hear the drums Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

(Repeat x2)
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Yes, if I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando...",Fernando

Synthesizer Rock Orchestra,"Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh

Just an alley creeper, light on his feet
A young fighter screaming, with no time for doubt

Synthesizer Rock Orchestra,"Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who find the money when you pay the rent
Did you think that money was heaven sent

Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlegs
See how they run

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest
Pa pa pa pa,
See how they run

Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night you stocking needed mending

Has left a pool of tears

Anyway you'll never know
The many ways I've tried

In my dreams I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball...

If I had a little money

You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy
And so I dealt you the blow
One of us had to go
Now it's different, I want you to know

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show
One of us had to go
Now I've changed and I want you to know

I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio

You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds - invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh - you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly
Radio

So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

You've yet to have your finest hour

On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years

Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.

The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.

I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.

And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,

Come non detto, non serve che mi tocchi 
Come non aver detto niente, tanto la verità 
Ha il profumo del tuo cuore 

Vedi che è sempre tutto un progetto aperto 
Non siamo nè la figlia modello nè il figlio perfetto 
Le scelte di cuore le prendo di petto, le pezze a colori 
La perfezione è solamente un concetto 

L’amore che lega o l’amore che ti nega 
Come una pietra al collo e il peso che ci annega 
Una pagina di vita che prende la sua piega 
Mentre provi a parole ma l’amore non si spiega

Syrian,"From the coast of gold, across the seven seas
I'm travelling on, far and wide
But now it seems, I'm just a stranger to myself,
And all the things I sometimes do
It isn't me but someone else.

I close my eyes, and think of home
Another city goes by, in the night
Ain't it funny how it is
You never miss it til it's gone away
And my heart is lying there 
And will be til my dying day

So understand
Don't waste your time 
Always searching for those wasted years
Face up...make your stand
And realise you're living in the golden years

Too much time on my hands
I got you on my mind
Can't ease this pain, so easily
When you can't find the words to say
It's hard to make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry
A nd throw my hands up to the sky

They can't catch me they're never gonna find me
('Cause I'm a High Plains Drifter, drifter)
They're never gonna know that I'm the High Plains Drifter
Pulled over to the river to take a rest
Pulled out a pair of pliers, pulled the bullet out of my chest
Fear and loathing across the country listening to my 8 track
I reached behind the seat and snatched a Kool from the pack
A long distance from my girl, and I'm talking on the cellular
She said that she was sorry and I said yeah, the hell you were
Check my rear view mirror, check the gold tooth display
Check out the odometer and I was on my way
'Cause I'm the High Plains Drifter, the best that you can get
A strapped shoplifter, a pirate on cassette
('Cause I'm a High Plains Drifter, drifter)
Bust a Travis Bickle when I feel that I'm getting pushed
Don't step to me or you're gonna get mushed

I'm doing one hundred twenty plowing over mail boxes
Radar detector to tell me where the cops is
Spend another night at the Motel six
It's five dollars extra get the porno flicks
And then I concoct a Black and Tan in my brandy snifter
I'm a kleptomaniac, K-Mart shoplifter
Cash flow getting low so I had to pull a job
I found a nice place to visit but a better place to rob
I left my car outside, and the engine still revvin'
Taking care of business at seven-eleven
And then I went inside to make my withdrawal
I saw what he had had, but I had to take it all
Knucklehead deli tried to gyp me on the price
So I clocked him off the turban with a bag of ice
'Cause I'm mell-el-o like jell-el-o, cool like lemonade
I made my getaway and then I thought that I had it made
I feel like Steve McQueen, a former movie star
Look in my rearview mirror seen a police car
Ballantine quarts with the puzzle on the cap
I couldn't help to notice I was caught in a speed trap
Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry, on the run from Dirty Harry
Stash the cash in the dash, but my gun I did carry
I'm seeing blue and red flashing deep in the night
I got my alibi straight and I pulled over to the right
The cop knocked on my window, said boy, where's the fire?
You've got a mailbox on your bumper and a bald front tire
Outta the car longhair, your goose is cooked
Read me my rights, fingerprinted, and booked
Makin' like a D.T. driving a Gran Fury
Wherever I hang my hat's my home and my past is kind of blurry
('Cause I'm a High Plains Drifter, drifter)
Every dog will have its day, mine will be in front of a jury
I'm the High Plains Drifter you know that I'm never in a hurry
('Cause I'm a High Plains Drifter, drifter)
Read me my rights, as if I didn't know this
Threw me in the tank with a drunk called Otis
With his five o' clock shadow, he smelled of three day old beer
My man turned to me and said why are you here
I said I'm charming, I'm dashing, I'm rental car bashing
I'm phony paper passing at Nix Check Cashing
I went before the judge he sent me to the Brooklyn House of D
He said you behave son or we'll throw away the key
Houdini'd out the cuffs, I kicked the screw in the knee
I took the bailiff's wallet and went straight to OTB
I had a good feeling, easy come, easy go
I bet on one horse to win and another to show
And sure enough that nag came in
Brought my ticket to the window and collected my win
And then I broke into my new car with a wire coat hanger
Hot wired, hot wheeled, and Suzy is a headbanger",High Plains Drifter

I love niggas, because niggas are me. And I should only love that which is me. I love that you niggas go through changes, love that you niggas act, love that you niggas make some plays and shoot the shit. But there's one thing about niggas that I don't love. Niggas are scared of revolution.

[T-K.A.S.H.]

There's a war going on at home
It's like Baghdad
In American cities where all the blacks at
Little kids that pack straps and backpacks
Who clap cats for scratch snacks and gas masks
Hard times
Niggas are on the grind
All of the time
Faith in Allah small as a dime
A cup of noodles for breakfast
A cup of noodles for lunch and
A cup of noodles for dinner
Every day is the Winter
Every day is December
Cause evin in the middle of Summer
The streets shudder from the poverty blizzard
Rocket propelled grenades
Landmines and letterbombs
Open up your envelops
With thoughts of them shuttin off
Your water and your lights
And your foods and your rights
All you got in your life
Is little dude and your wife
So you move in the white
With the crew in the night
But you're nervous:
The block drafted you into the service
The curse

You ain't a made nigga, you just afraid nigga
You ain't a made nigga, you just afraid nigga
You ain't a made nigga, you just afraid nigga
You ain't a made nigga, you just afraid nigga

Wakin' up is the beginning of a day that's fucked
Spoons and forks and napkins and plates and cups
Everything but a meal
I bang with my steel
And feel hunger pains in me still
I hit the front line with my ammo and my canteen
Basketball and tennis shoes as a sand screen
Shootin' jumpers as the boys in blue pass me
Casually
I pass cream to the crack fiends
The other day a first Lieutenant was moded
Started up the car and it exploded
But didn't nobody notice
I'm knowin' how it goes
When if the the nigga with the purple heart of courage ain't the oldest
It's cold shit
But if I let little man push
Little man could go and create a plan to ambush
Double jeopardy
Brothers reppin' me
And tellin' me they lovin' and respectin' me
Could be the death of me

You ain't a made nigga, you just afraid nigga
God in heaven could you tell me why you never chose me
You ain't a made nigga, you just afraid nigga
Times I asked you to provide or we wasn't goin' to eat
You ain't a made nigga, you just afraid nigga
Why was everything that you was supposed to do on me
You ain't a made nigga, you just afraid nigga
Since I'm not in heaven it's only one other place I can be

Now shit's hard, when you're up in rank this far
I hit bars and I mix and mingle with stars
You flip cars with overtime you get scarred
And with your broad you begin to whisper “discharge”
Traumatized by the lies of the turncoats
Who walk enemy ground to go and burn smoke
Five dead single shot glock nine to the head
And you like, “Fuck em'”
Them niggas have to learn though
But things deepen
Your enemy's peepin'
The rate you're gain' weight got your thinergies creepin'
They see you're not sleepin'
So they got reason
To send a soldier in your circle
And manipulate the treason
A psychological Hurricane Katrina
And ain't nobody comin' to help
Fuck FEMA

And Mohhamed Era Su Allayet (?)

Like I didn't create the projects, I didn't create homelessness, I didn't create poverty, I didn't create unemployment, I didn't create this poor educational system, I was pushed into it, and now you want to blame me for not rising above it? Shit, I may not be that strong!

Tired of all these wanna-beez
Get away

Plates, nobody knows the name, nobody knows the pain
The fame's last on list
Can't get paid with mic in the syst'
Gotta roll with a goal that swells the pole
These stories are told, when I was like
Ten why-years old, won't be mad if it don't go gold
I could gives a fuck
Still cut my zit, and gives it all to soul
I rocks the mic, like, dyke, hypes, like, pipes
Who got the style, type, like, this, tight, type, tyke?
I'm stronger than straight with no chase
Emcees I step to's like a staircase
Kick em to the bottom like BASS
Let that ink sink into your vellum
Open up your eyes then I swell em

[Chorus: (T-Love) Chali 2na]
(Oh, ah, oh oh ah, oh, ah ah)
Wanna-Beez emcees, think they make cheese
""Would you like to be a part of my fan-fanta-fantasy?""
(Oh, ah, oh oh ah, oh, ah ah)
Wanna-Beez I sees, pretend they make G's
""Would you like to be a part of my fan-fanta-fantasy?""

[Chali 2na]
Yo some of you brothers be livin lavishly
But it's a travesty
You're selling millions of records
But you a crab emcee
Faking hard as a rock, you just a wimp man please
Your crew is a circus act of chim-pan-zees
There's a disease in your lecture
Lacking extra texture, what you flex neglects to wreck
Got ta execute you pile; and boot the file
When I shoot the style I'm giving root canals
Now which of you punks be amongst me
To let the funk free, I keep my composition junk free
Consistently, like your monthly
Plus I'm scent free, wack emcees can not hunt me, down
Kicking freeze in the sound booth
Wanna-beez, be on they knees to get down
Truth be told, the proof we hold, woke the old
When they made me into an emcee, they broke the mold
Like that

[Chorus]

[T-Love]
No time's narrowing
I don't be flipping with the heroin, like Errol Flynn
See I can fly, high up in the sky
Have track marks, all up on my thigh, but why?
Cause Baton Rouge blues, don't compare
To Malibu, you, can have anything you choose
Yet you all up in this be girl's news
Trying to wear shoes
All up in my mix, waiting for the opportunity
To transfix, to culturist
You want to-be down with the, crews and clicks
But, you can't kick it, why? He's a punk bitch
Jocking Wu-Tang, don't know new slang
Mad cause you can't hit black pu-tang
All be	-Boys and Girls will soon see
That you are, a, want to, be

Well I begin the weekend with a groove roll about eight deep now
What's my next move
Wait until night fall so I could enjoy systems
Pump by four Jeeps
running like a convoy roll to the club
Kind of crowded
What a scene
pulling up with Jodeci
Blasting out the fifteen
So I park my ride 
Girls see my gear and notice my grill
Here comes the pointing and staring
 
Ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of your body tonight.
Whoa, ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of you body tonight.
 
Now I sign a couple of autographs
Take a few flicks
Order Dom Perignon and lay back with my chicks
Mike is on the left of me
Smooth is Flipping
Tricky and Moet are on the dance floor ripping
Silk is with a cutie
Big D, I'm trying to find him
Tim is in the front and
Mo'Bettas right behind
and me I'm just laying on the prowl
Guys say what's up as the girls cry aaaahhh
She grabbed her man
I think she tried to play'em
My only thought was to step to the a.m.
'Cause I came to have a good time
and at the end of the night
No doubt I'm gonna get mine
'Cause I don't have to raise my voice to be seen
I maintain if you know what I mean
understand I'm not conceded
Father's just mellow
I'm a smooth dark romeo freak kind of fellow

Do that dance. Let's work it out.

Lounging on the d.l.
this type of night is rare
I glance to the right
Oh, who do we have here
Puff and stew gettin' ripped
What the hell
I see Mr. Uptown himself, Andre Harrell
conversating 
with his boys
as they start to barge straight through the crowd
It's time to get charged
It's kinda mello, so I leap to sista' and the soul
rollin' five deep
Mark, Corey, Shakim, L.Q. doin' the wild thing
'cause the soul is true
And every time I hear the music thump-id-dee-thump
and all the girlz gettin' bucked right in your rump
So everybody who feel the mood is right
Get on the dance floor

On top of that I'm kinda horny 
And I gotta get back to her,
Now I'm leavin' quickly,
Before she come and try to get me,
And I'm takin' everything with me,
Well it all come down to her",I'm Sprung 2

How many times have I told you love you?
Don't seem to change a thing
Girl you're not the same
There was a time when you want me to hug you
And treat you like the lady that you wanna be 
But girl I knew that one in me
Would never try to hold me back 
And do me all this wrong, girl what's going on?

I tried to talk and you walk away
Right out of my face, right out of my place
But

That's just it girl
You just don't know how much I love you now
That you walked out of my house
That's just it girl
Would it be another day, be another way
To get you right back in my place

How many times have we sat at the table?
And both ate one time and said what's on our mind
I'm thinking of a relationship was a fable
A fairytale of me, that's just how it seems (oh girl, I heard)
Even when I heard that you were cheating, I was faithful
And would do any goddamn thing that you would say too

Rappa, producer
A whole stack of thangs

And they gone play me though
So we came up, not givin' a fuck

Got niggas lil' ladies
Droppin' they panties
Smackin' they fannies, sayin' his name
So I'm playin the game they want me to play
Sayin' everythang they want me to say
And I promised home boy
If I get back to this rappin'
It won't be today
Ain't got time for the rap shit, bap shit
Make a hand clap shit,
Nappy, nappy, nappy mo nap shit
That shit second
This shit first
That shit harder
This shit worse
And this shit curse me
And it hurts me to let it go
But I gotta come back to the sack
To let these otha niggas know
That its another side of Teddy
Another dub side on the machetti
A fucking prime spot on the Chevy
The situation gets heavy

I thought I'd be a man and tell you first, but I know it's got to hurt
Baby, please let me explain (explain-plain-plain)

I probably would have not pulled over and asked her if she need (a ride)
But I noticed she had make-up on her eye, then she started to cry
I said, ""Baby, please, explain.""
She said her man put his hands on her, he was outta control
And she really needs someone to hold and not let go
And then she looked into my eyes just like you do, then I imagined she was you

Baby, I wish that I was a magician and I could make all of this disappear
And, baby, I wish that I could go back in time; and trust me, baby, we wouldn't be here
But you've been so good to me, how could I do this to you?
And I never meant to hurt you, how can I prove it to you?

You said you're goin' to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there (uh)
Until I heard you come up the stairs (uh)
And I pretended I was sleeping (uh) and I was hoping

It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and I want ya
And you want me, don't ya?
I can see it
Cause you've been waiting on me since I said that I was hittin' the club

Something coming up on me
And I know you be getting so horny
'Cause you be sending me texts saying
Like boy just get your ass up in that car and come get all of this love

(It's 5 o'clock in the morning)
You ain't got to remind me
She already said if I don't come home on time she might go crazy
And she'll be waiting on me naked with one of my chains on
She might come and find me (oh)
And then ask me kindly (oh)
Do I want her to go crazy?
We do this every night and then we always wake up singing the same song

It's 5 o'clock in the morning (yeah)

And these females got me stalling
I can hear your voice in my head like ""What is he doing?"" oh what is he doing?
Cause I keep checking my cell phone and these missed calls
You texting me like I'm a kill y'all
If you don't get your ass up out of that club and you do know what time it is

And this Nuvo got me trippin' and I know that you mad girl
But you ain't got to worry about nothing

And you'll be right at home waiting for me
Iphone plugged in the wall, just waiting for me
Club closed at six, left around four thirty yeah so by the time I'm at your crib

And you yawning, but I've been drinking all night and I feel like performin'
With you in the bedroom floor to the dresser
Don't want nothing less 'cause I'm sure you're the best you're the one so I let you
That's how you show me love
And when we finish you like ""damn, babe you woke me up""
I love you way you put it down likes it's for both of us

Is this just a spell we're under
All we seeing is the rain and thunder
Can we kick it in to an endless summer
(come on) free flowin' communication
Break the hypnosis grippin' the nation
Do you know what I mean?

Maybe now it's up to us to put down
The recipe we got to turn this 'round
Time to turn the focus on to you and me

You got to believe in you and me
Don't you know the truth will set you free
You've got to believe in you and me
Don't you turn your back on destiny
Ahh yeah... truth gonna you free

There are times when it all seems hopeless
I look at the dice how did I roll this
Is there a way we can all find solace
Can't we change the channel and adjust the focus
(come on) a new world where the choice is endless
I gotta message and I gotta send this
Do you know what I mean?
Maybe now it's us to put right
Warm a chill we feelin' on a cold night

But that's only 'cause for now it's truthless

Where we gonna be when we turn 25
I keep thinking times will never change
Keep on thinking things will always be the same
But when we leave this year we won't be coming back
No more hanging out 'cause we're on a different track
And if you got something that you need to say
You better say it right now 'cause you don't have another day
'cause we're moving on and we can't slow down
And these memories are playing like a film without sound
And I get so excited and we'd get so scared
Laughing at ourselves thinking life's not fair
And this is how it feels

As we go on, we remember
All the times we had together
And as our lives change
Come whatever
We will still be friends forever

So if we get the big jobs and we make the big money
When we look back now, will our jokes still be funny
We will still remember everything we learned in school
Still be trying break every single rule
Will little brainy bobby be the stockbroker man
Can heather find a job that won't interfere with her tan
I keep, keep thinking that it's not goodbye
I keep on thinking it's our time to fly

[Chorus]

Will we think about tomorrow like we think about now?
Will we survive it out there?
Will we make it somehow?
I guess I thought that this would never end
And suddenly it's like we're women and men
Will the past be a shadow that will follow us 'round
Will these memories fade when I leave this town
I keep, keep think that it's not goodbye
I keep on thinking it's our time to fly

The love that flows through every song

Some people say that anything can happen
That you can make it right as long as you believe
But if the rain comes and the clouds get dampened
Just keep on keeping on and know that you will see

Were we gonna go under?

Some people think that they are better on their own

And I can see it in the way that we have shone

T-Squad,"You know parents are the same, no matter time nor place
They don't understand that us kids are going to make some mistakes
So to you, all the kids all across the land, there's no need to argue
Parents just don't understand

I remember one year, my mom took me school shopping
It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister
All hopped in the car
We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall
My mom started bugging with the clothes she chose
I didn't say nothing at first, I just turned up my nose
She said, ""What's wrong? This shirt cost twenty dollars""
I said, ""Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar""

The next half hour was the same old thing
My mother buying me clothes from 1963
And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate
I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips
I said, ""Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep""
She said, ""You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet""
I said, ""Mom, let's put these clothes back, please""
She said, ""No, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show""

I said, ""This isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowze
Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers
But if you don't want to I can live with that but
You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks""
She wasn't really, everything stayed the same
Inevitably the first day of school came
I thought I could get over, I tried to play sick
But my mom said, no, no way, uh-uh, forget it

There was nothing I could do, I tried to relax
I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts
And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought
The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought
And those who weren't laughing still had a ball
Because they were pointing and whispering as I walked down the hall
I got home and told my Mom how my day went, she said
""If they were laughing you don't need 'em 'cause they're not good friends""

For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom
That I was gonna have to go through this about two-hundred more times
So to you all the kids all across the land, there's no need to argue
Parents just don't understand

Okay, here's the situation
My parents went away on a week's vacation
And they left the keys to the brand new Porsche
Would they mind? Umm, well, of course not
I'll just take it for a little spin
And maybe show it off to a couple of friends
I'll just cruise it around the neighborhood
Well, maybe I shouldn't, yeah, of course I should

Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot
I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block
And that's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking
I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking
You should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions
I honked my horn just to get her attention
She said, ""Was that for me?"", I said, ""Yeah""
She said, ""Why?"", I said, ""Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy""

She said, ""How do I know you're not sick
You could be some deranged lunatic""
I said, ""c'mon toots, my name is the Prince
Beside, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?""
She agreed and we were on our way
She was looking very good and so was I, I must say word
We hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive
We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes

She kicked her shoes off onto the floor
She said, ""Drive fast, speed turns me on""
She put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas
We almost got whiplash, I took off so fast
The sun roof was open, the music was high
And this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh
She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far
I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car

We're doing ninety in my Mom's new Porsche
And to make this long story short, short
When the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell
I said, ""I don't have a license but I drive very well, officer""
I almost had a heart attack that day
Come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway
I was arrested, the car was impounded
There was no way for me to avoid being grounded

My parents had to come off from vacation to get me
I'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me
My parents walked in
And I got my grip, I said, ""Ah, Mom, Dad, how was your trip?""
They didn't speak, I said, ""I want to plead my case""
But my father just shoved me in the car by my face
That was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived
They took turns, one would beat me while the other one was driving

I can't believe it, I just made a mistake
Well parents are the same no matter time nor place
So to you all the kids all across the land, take it form me

T. Duggins,"In the city of Chicago, as the evening shadows fall
There are people dreaming of the hills of Donegal

Eighteen forty-seven was the year it all began
Deadly pains of hunger drove a million from the land
They journeyed not for glory, their motive wasn't greed
A voyage of survival across the stormy sea

To the city of Chicago, as the evening shadows fall
There are people dreaming of the hills of Donegal

Some of them knew fortune and some of them knew fame
More of them knew hardship, died upon the plane
They spread throughout the nation, they rode the railroad cars
Brought their songs and music to ease their lonely hearts

To the city of Chicago, as the evening shadows fall
There are people dreaming of the hills of Donegal




",(The City Of) Chicago
T. Duggins,"The last time I saw you was down at the Greeks
There was whiskey on Sunday and tears on your cheeks
You sang me a song as pure as the breeze
On a road leading up Glenaveigh

I sat for a while at the cross at Finnoe
Where young lovers would meet when the flowers were in bloom
Heard the men coming from as far as Shinrone
Their hearts in Tipperary wherever they go

Take my hand and dry your tears, babe
Take my hand, forget your fears, babe
There's no pain, there's no more sorrow
They've all gone, gone in the years, babe

I sat for a while by the gap in the wall
Found a rusty tin can and an old Hurley ball
Heard the cards being dealt and the rosary called
And a fiddle playing 'Sean Dun Na Ngall'

And the next time I see you we'll be down at the Greeks
There'll be whiskey on Sunday and tears on our cheeks
For it's stupid to laugh and it's useless to bawl
About a rusty tin can and an old Hurley ball

Take my hand and dry your tears, babe
Take my hand, forget your fears, babe
There's no pain, there's no more sorrow
They've all gone, gone in the years, babe

So I walked as day was dawning
As small birds sang when leaves were falling
Where we once watched the row boats landing
On the broad majestic Shannon

Sometimes I live in the country
Sometimes I live in town
Sometimes I take a few notions

Now me and my wife settled down
Now me and my wife are parting

There's not a sound, so it's time for me to dream.
The window pane, late city scenes, so far
Away from where I was weaned.

There was a girl so long ago, all through
The park at night we would go
All just as late as it is now, two discontented,
A young one's vow

I'm here for you, only to adore you.
You mean everything to me.
And you're with me wherever I go, and I
Miss you wherever I go.

Well, goodbye to old friends.
I watched you go.
From where I sit now, I still say hello.
All the memories gone by, those that I
Couldn't call.
An eternal divide, the distance too long.

Dead as a mackerel.
Dead as a door.
Dead as a nail, but never a bore.

Always good for a laugh.
Always good for a shout.
Always good for a memory when the
Lights are out.",Late
T. Duggins,"With our nets and gear we're faring
On the wild and wasteful ocean.
Its there that we hunt and we earn our bread
As we hunted for the shoals of herring

O it was a fine and a pleasant day
Out of Yarmouth harbor I was faring
As a cabin boy on a sailing lugger
For to go and hunt the shoals of herring

O the work was hard and the hours long
And the treatment, sure it took some bearing
There was little kindness and the kicks were many
As we hunted for the shoals of herring

O we fished the Swarth and the Broken Bank
I was cook and I'd a quarter sharing
And I used to sleep standing on my feet
And I'd dream about the shoals of herring

O we left the home grounds in the month of June
And to Canny Shiels we soon were bearing
With a hundred cran of silver darlings
That we'd taken from the shoals of herring

Now you're up on deck, you're a fisherman
You can swear and show a manly bearing
Take your turn on watch with the other fellows
While you're searching for the shoals of herring

In the stormy seas and the living gales
Just to earn your daily bread you're daring
From the Dover Straits to the Faroe Islands
As you're following the shoals of herring

O I earned my keep and I paid my way
And I earned the gear that I was wearing
Sailed a million miles, caught ten million fishes
We were sailing after shoals of herring",Shoals of Herring

T. Graham Brown,"[Chorus]
Oh it tears me up when you go all to pieces
Your cryin' eyes say you've been hurt enough
Tryin' hard don't always make it easy
Cause hearts aren't made to break, they're made to love

Lately all I do is think about you
It's weighin' like a stone inside my mind
I know I've taken you for granted
And left your heart hangin' on the line

[Chorus]

Your love is finally gettin' to me
I can't believe the things I've done
And still you're standin' here beside me
The fool and the faithful one

And you're never gonna find another somebody like me.
And you wish you had more than just a lifetime,
To give back all I've given you, and that's what you believe.

But I owe you, the sunlight in the morning,
And the nights of honest lovin',
That time can't take away.
And I owe you, more than life now, more than ever.
I know it's the sweetest debt,
I'll ever have to pay.

I'm amazed when you say it's me you live for.
You know know when I am holding you,
You're right where you belong.
An' my love, I can't can't but smile with wonder,
When you tell me all I've done for you,
Cause I've known all along.

T. Graham Brown,"I stood before God, my family and friends
And vowed that I'd never love anyone else again
Only him

As pure a s my gown of white I stood by his side
And promised that I'd love you till the day I died
Lord, please forgive me even though I lied
'Cause you're the only one who knows just how hard I tried

I had a ring on my finger and time on my hands
The woman in my needed the warmth of a man
The gold turned cold in my wedding band
It's just a ring on your finger
When there's time on your hands

When I add up all the countless nights I cried myself to sleep
And all the broken promises you somehow failed to keep
He can't blame me

He's the one who left me too many times alone
In a three bedroom prison
I tried to make a home
My love slowly died but the fire inside still burned
And the arms of a stranger was the only place left to turn

I had a ring on my finger and time on my hands
The woman in my needed the warmth of a man
The gold turned cold in my wedding band

T. Graham Brown,"Lonely lady living down the hall
 Don't you have any friends at all
 I never hear a knocking at your door
 Could it be you just don't try anymore?
 You've been hurt so seriously
 You act so cold but it's so easy to see
 You're a waste of real good love
 But you can't hide or run fast enough

 [Chorus]
 Somebody's gonna love you, no matter what you do
 Somebody's gonna find all the pieces of a broken heart
 Hidden inside of you
 Somebody's gonna touch you, it's just a matter of time
 And if you're ever gonna try love again, it might as well be mine

 I know exactly how a heartache feels
 It's gonna take a little time to heal
 Why must you hide away inside yourself
 You could mean so much to someone else
 Every night while you're sittin' at home
 You may be lonely but you're not alone
 There's a whole world full of people out there
 Waiting on someone like you to care

I pray one more is not too much to ask
I've tried to fight this battle by myself
But it's a war that I can't win without Your help

Tonight, I'm as low as any man can go
I'm down and I can't fall much farther
And once upon a time, You turned the water into wine
An' now, on my knees, I'm turning to You, Father
Could You help me turn the wine back into water?

So many times I've hurt the ones I love
I pushed them to the edge of giving up
They've stood by me but how much can they stand
If I don't put this bottle in Your hands?

Tonight, I'm as low as any man can go
I'm down and I can't fall much farther
And once upon a time, You turned the water into wine
An' now, on my knees, I'm turning to You, Father
Could You help me turn the wine back into water?

I shook my fist at heaven for all the hell that I've been through
Now I'm begging for forgiveness and a miracle from You

There's so much I wanna say

But tonight I wanna hold you

It feels so good to say the words again

Seems like it's always something, something I can't change
I'm either looking back, haunted by regret
Or finding trouble with tomorrow that hasn't even happened yet

Everyday the choices just keep on comin' up
And I know it all comes down to fear, oh Lord
And I surrender myself to what the future will bring
Well, I'm just trying to do the next right thing

Every time I try to be a man I wanna be
There's a world of sweet temptation calling out to me
And there's that voice inside that whispers sweet and low
Always waiting to remind me of all the truth I already know

I'm with the futuristic timeless
I'm a break her back spineless
But if tonight takes a turn for the worst the cure in my cup's gunna quench my thirst

Born a true blue thoroughbred
Head a chiselled face of fables
Omen of no ill

Blooms that twine around your ears
Blossoms of the royalest texture angel of the years

Clad in sacks and scraps of linen
Living 'neath your waterwell
Praying that my youthy pauper's face
Will quench you well

Gazelle girl striding through your palace
Precious jewels nestle in your hair
Rameses born with platinum future
Take my heart and care.

Blown out my mind, I can't keep up the pace

My gone little mama cut out without a sound

With my greased-up levis,
Baseball boots above my head
If it wasn't such a tragedy
I might wish I was dead

She took my ice-cream mustang
And my purple coloured dodeville
She even took my panpipes and my elixir of life pill

want to fly to a place where it's just you and me
Nobody else so we can be free

All the things she said
All the things she said
Running through my head
All the things she said
All the things she said
Running through my head 
This is not enough
This is not enough

All the things she said
All the things she said

And I'm all mixed up, feeling cornered and rushed
They say it's my fault but I want her so much
want to fly her away where the sun and rain
Come in over my face, wash away all the shame
When they stop and stare - don't worry me
'Cause I'm feeling for her what she's feeling for me
I can try to pretend, I can try to forget
But it's driving me mad, going out of my head

Mother looking at me
Tell me what do you see?
Yes, I've lost my mind

Daddy looking at me
Will I ever be free?
Have I crossed the line?

No house on a hill full of life's finer things
And I'll tell you right now there's a whole lot that I just can't do
Oh, but baby don't think I can't love you

I'm beat down girl, I'm dead on my feet

Broken promises I have instead

That God for my mother hers was no easy song
Thank God that He showed me, how to get along

My papa was a rolling stone, abandoned us & left us lone
And how it broke my heart and home & had me losin' faith
Somebody saw what I went through and understood, had been there too
So glad they introduced me to, my Father
Your story sounds a lot like mine, it's a story told a thousand times
Someone hurting leaves in dis-array

But don't you know that God made you, more valuable than they ever knew
You know you can live past their mistakes
How you sit and wonder, how could all this be, someone that you loved so much
Just turn their backs and leave
Oh You need the lover of your soul and He is able to take care of you
Find He will never leave
Your papa was a rolling stone, abandoned you and left you lone

And how it broke your heart and home and has you losing faith
I'm seein' what you've going through: I understand, I've been there too
So let me introduce you to my Father
No longer, solid ground under my feet
I know what my life is worth, no longer incomplete
I just want to tell you, you are really loved

He tells her he needs her but someone's at home

T.G. Sheppard,"She's got that dark hair falling 'cross her shoulders
There's not a man alive that wouldn't want to hold her
And the way she moves, just the way she moves
Well, that's enough to keep me on a slow burn
Keep me on a slow burn

In her high heals kicking 'cross the dance floor
She's more woman than I could ever ask for
Still there's something in her eyes, in those dark eyes
That's love and that keeps me on a slow burn
Keeps me on a slow burn

When we touch this fire breaks out
And it rages out of control
And the love we made is so deep, so strong
And when it's over, even when it's over
And the flame dies down
It just dies down to a slow burn, slow burn

And the love we made is so deep, so strong
That when it's over, even when it's over
And the flame dies down
It just dies down to a slow burn, a slow burn

Keeps me on a slow burn
In her high heals kicking 'cross the dance floor
Keeps me on a slow burn

T.G. Sheppard,"It was July hot in Georgia in 1942 all the men were off to war and the woman had nothing to do.
I was sixteen and hungry looking for my first taste of love, When I brought the groceries to the door I didn't know how close I was. Her long blond hair was flowing and she smelled like sweet perfume. When I laid her groceries down she said you don't have to leave so soon. A woman sure gets lonely when a men gone off to fight. She reached up for my trembling hand as tear drops filled her eyes then she said.

Chores:

War is hell on the home front too. God only knows what a woman goes though. She still needs what a man that's gone can't do.

 I can't fight this fire along stay with me until it's gone. Ooh war is Hell on the Home front Too. It was July hot in side me as she lead me to the bed room door with satin sheets and pleasure (I never knew I could feel before). My first taste of lovin' was everything it should have been, when a woman's fighting loneliness it's a battle she can't win. I'll always remember what she did and what she said but the one thing I remember most was the way she turned his picture over on the table by her bed and now she says.

Keep your mind on your grind and off mine alright
Hard I'm a ball on them squares I float
Quarter million dollar cars everywhere I go
I know in the lead it may see it might be
But no matter what they doing they don't do it like me
Like a G I hold it down for the town I'm at
And I flash like that
Recognize I'm back!
Strike a match catch a fire

Any moment I decide that's enough of all your lies
Boy your buzz just died
Step inside super fly to the shoes in their coupe
Then exit out with all the bitches like we always do
My desire to retire growing every new coupe
Cause these guys just don't ride like mi nigga you too
Tight jeans, funny hair, cause dancing on the screen
It's about the real niggas in the game so it seems
Just pretending holla pimpin' get a sh-t a black eye eye
Next he say he trapping in my head I'm like why
Be yourself, you ain't gotta pimp bone in your body
I can tell ya ain't never bought a key or caught a body
Nigga probably just seen Wayne, Gucci Mane, Me and Boosie all go to prison
And they flip their whole image nigga tripping
Listen, do for you that ain't in the cars
Think the power is in your gun but over all it's in your heart
Nowadays I don't know whats up with niggas in the A
Guess he think he in the game but he really in the way
Violating, I was having conversations in the joint
But guess who done it and I promised I would put you on point
I'm disappointed in you dog you ain't hold it down at all
But I ain't going in your jaw just gon' show ya how to ball
Standin' tall through the storm on the yard or in the dorm
Cats in prison who expecting me to represent for em

I never let you down I'm a shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off mine alright
Hard I'm a ball on them squares I float

Whats a Molotov cocktail to never break a glass
Scary ass nigga wanna come for me you better bring it
I ain't mad I forgive em, God I know they ain't mean it
Yeah I seen it all before, hey, I'm popping and they ain't
Rack they brain try to think how to stop it and they can't
Ain't that lame but then that hatred manifest to pure malice
I'm no longer being careless so I'm gon' let you niggas have it
Won't be satisfied till somebody dies and I'm patient
Waiting on me and the reaper on a first name basis now
I'm a let you make it now, stay totally out the way for you
But know that we can take it any place you wanna take it to
Hating in your blood, cause, guess it's just too late for you
All I could do is pray for you or organize a wake for you
Your choice, clearly I ain't hearing your voice
Keep it up and I'm gon' send your ass to '
Hey, you can the bottom partner I'm gon' bring the sky box

Leave us with ones who misleadin' us
Then go and reward all the ones who mistreat us
And leave us in projects and give us these poisonous products
On top of narcotics to push to our sisters and brothers
Like them ain't our sisters and brothers
No we will not be run amuck, led astray
Or bamboozled, the buck'll be stoppin' today
See what happen when athletes'll no longer play for you
Tell them accountants to pray for you
On respect or just respect what that paper'll do
Look up, it too late for you
Droppin' you off
Turnin' them profit to loss
When we won't go shop in the mall
United we all, stuck in this bullshit together
Showin' these folk we just won't take whatever
Or else they just roll up and shoot at whatever
Just like they've been doin' forever
The niggas swear they hard be huffin' and puffin'
But ain't gon' do nothin'
The enemy try 'em
They wait behind enemy lines
Why you tryna be so friendly now?
Handle your business now
And we won't fear nothin' but judgement from God
Standin' there lookin' at me sayin' you ain't do nothin'
I bless you when you ain't invested in nothin'
Just kept up the cycle of death and destruction
Ignornin' you neighbor won't help him but helpin' yourself
Just like the devil himself, hmm
Promote all that fornication
All that baby makin', ain't no baby raisin'
For a generation
Now they trapped in systems 'cause incarceration
Was inevitable due to education
Substandard institution never cared
J's drop, buyin' every pair
Crack rock, Crip, Blood, all the 80
GDP and whatever else separate us
Hip-hop, king you finally made it
Your time to take it
Pass Martin Luther
All that money and you still blew it
Didn't save and you feel stupid
iTunes came and they bootleggin'
What you get for bein' hard headed

T.I.,"Damn, has it been that long?
Is that what happens since I been gone, homie?
They go that game all wrong, it's too pretty in here
Lets say we take it back to the ? one time

I went from rolling wit' dem rocks on the block
To controlling my position at the top of every chart I will not stop
(We ride, we roll, in style)
(hey, hey, hey)
(yea you know, yea you know, yea you know,
Yea you know, yea you know, yea you know)
Yea we ride, and we roll, and we style,
Here we go, here we go, we go, we go

In the middle of a fight, I'm so cool
Everybody want it hot I go through
All of this half of which would have broke you
Came out smelling like a rose even more ?
Worldwide, bi-costal, global, nigga's I respect
Cause they ?
Cause I ain't got a damn minute ain't no 'tude
?
Kickin' doors over just to let my dogs in
So many rides never catch a n-gga walkin'
In a G-5 tryna put a bunch of broads in
Then we landin' laughin' chicks with fantastic asses
Extravagant habitats, if you never seen tragic happen (hey)
Make magic happen with cash I'm actually catchin' magic
In the market for lavish mansions 'n N-B-A expansions
?
Way past respect you see, but I neva' as big as a nigga felt a beat ya see

I went from rolling wit' dem rocks on the block

So fly why would I wanna land for
Everything you could ask for and more
Your choice, you could even be a fan or
Hate to see a nigga get a hundred grand more
Bein' a motherfuckin' man, won't stand for
The rap wars, always goin' back and forth
Livin' in a ? killing like cancer
? that's for damn sure
?
The same people on tour, on T-V
The signed ? shoulda kept your receipt
Get a refund cause you sure can't see me
Who keeps CD's on repeat, stuck in MP3's for 3 weeks
At the gates on the day I was released
The only time you will ever see me free
Big money J, much as you can get for it?
Atlantic records say just make another hit for me
I tell 'em cut a hundred million dollar check for me
Like it or not, don't lose no respect for me
Never mind what I did, cause the best commin'
I'm the king in a game like chess to me
So put the cash in tha bag,
Give the rest to the attendant puttin' gas in it

I went from rolling wit' dem rocks on the block
To controlling my position at the top of every chart I will not stop

Yea you know, yea you know, yea you know)
Yea we ride, and we roll, and we style,
Here we go, here we go, we go, we go

I got a new swag and it's a new day
Here we go again too, what it do 'J?
I'll give you a call, I know the way you used to move yay
Now I gotta new Audemar with a blue face
Hoppin' up in G4 jet no suitcase, whole new wardrobe in a new place
Chain close ? if a stain on my shoelace
T.I. roll like sushi touche.
If ya can't lay back, who the hell am I?
Bringin' homicide to the gang, no alibi
Can't tell a lie to the judge, I'm guilty
Your Honor do you mind the guy tried to kill me
I could still be, in a trap now
AK 'round, little yay 'round
100k downstairs by the trey pound.
But if ?

To get a rim posted corner

A sporty young shorty wit the Gucci shades dim
These hoes mistaken me for being they pimp
They said baby couldn't see you pass them shiny rims

T.I.,"Bartender I really did it this time
Broke my parole to have a good time
When I got home it was 6 A.M.
The door was locked so I kicked it in
She was tripping on the bills,
I think she was high on some pills
She through my shit out into the yard
Then she called me a punk and slapped me real hard
And in my drunken stupor I did
What I should of never done
Now I am sitting here talking to you
Drunk and on the run

[Chorus]
I sitting at the bar on the inside waiting on my ride on the outside
She broke my heart at the trailer park so I jacked her keys to her fucking car
And crashed that piece of shit and stepped away

You know Moe, I'll probably get ten years
So just give me beers until they get here
Yeah I know the sun is coming up
And y'all are probably getting ready for closing up
But I'm trying to drown my soul
I am tired of this life on a dirt road,
And everything that I love is gone
And I'm tired of hanging on
She got me sitting at the bar

[Chorus]

Guess it was meant to be romance
Is misery so much for memories
And now I am heading to the penitentiary
See me on TV the next cop series
I am a danger I guess I should have did something about my anger
But I never learn, real things I don't concern
I pour kerosene on everything I love and watch it burn
I know it's my fault but I wasn't happy it was over
She threw a fit so I crashed that piece of shit

And now I am going back again
Back to the pen to see my friends
When we all pile up on that county van
They'll ask me where I've been
I've been at a bar on the inside

[Chorus]",At the Bar
T.I.,"They say love blind, so why can't I picture this girl mine?
Yea I dig her but I figure, I'm wasting this girl time
I'm running from relationships, scared to commit
Mad at monogamy, sexually, I'm a misfit
But this shit's, way too much fo me
Usually I can take'em and make'em a cut buddy
Yo mama probably see me, and say that I'm no good
I was born in the burbs, I was raised in the hood
We from two separate sides of life, two different backgrounds
Shawty been legit and I just started to rap now
I ain't tryin' to act now, I'm being real with you
Really, I just wanted to kick it and chill with you
But the picture got bigger, 'fo I could even paint it
Thoughts got deeper befo' a nigga could think
A player like me on this, strange ain't it?
One thing bout yo feelins is this, you can't change it
Yo perception on me, I don't think I can maintain
We flirting with disaster, this game we playing is dangerous
You the best thing that happened since I don became famous
But sometimes I think we should of remained strangers

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
I, I chose you baby
(Stay with me now, stay with me, sing it for me shawty)
I, I, I, I, I chose you baby
(Ah, come on, uh, uh, uh see'mon)

I like you to pursue, but still I respect it to let it go
Give it time, give it room to breathe and let it grow
I'll just tell her when I'm ready to change, I'll let her know
Hate to say it, but til then be friends and nothing mo
Even though another time, another life, anotha place
I swear I know we could of been great
But rather than great, you lil' heart take the smile of yo face
So I can treat you right, I'm willing ta wait
And ain't shit fake, I know it sound funny coming from a felon
But I think I got a piece of was up in heaven
So to keep from, blocking mah blessings, think I better back up
Last thing a nigga need now is bad luck
But if my life was perfect shawty, I'da had her
I guess, I guess I don't deserve it, ballas tell me you ain't worth it
So I gots to hit the surface, I'll holla when I holla
Act like I don't want to see ya, and I'on want to call'er

[Chorus: x2]",Chooz U
T.I.,"[Verse 1] 
You looking good in them guess's shawty showing yo ass
Make a nigga want to grab a hold of yo ass
Strip you out yo couchie dress and hit the flo' wit yo ass
When I leave the club I want to see some more of yo ass
I ain't tricking shit but I might spend some dough on yo ass
The way you bouncing on my dick and grindin' slow wit yo ass
Hit the v.i.p. wit me I po' some moe' fo yo ass
Just so I can see you out there bouncing yo ass
If I leave the club wit something rather go wit yo ass
Them other broads fine but you a pro wit yo ass
When I see you popping and dropping I know it's yo ass
In a crowd full of hoes I would notice yo ass
 
[Bridge: T.I.]
A now a thug done chose 
And I don't give a damn if the club done closed
Give the DJ a dub tell him spin one mo
So I can finish watching you popping yo
Shaking yo, dropping yo, bouncing yo ass

I see ya every Friday night outside the club in da line wit ya partners
Shawty you see all that ass poking out them Dolce Gabbana's
Hey as soon as she get in I'm a find her ass
The first record the DJ spend I'm behind her ass
I don't care if I got some henn' I'm putting down my glass
Just so I can get out there and grind her ass
Wit yo fine ass, must I remind yo ass?
You da baddest thing in here that's why I'm eyeing yo ass
In ya Iceberg suit, ya face looking cute and I like those boots
Ya nails all pretty and ya hair due too
I'm fucking wit you, shit just choose and we'll be fucking by two
 
[Bridge]
 
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I made this song to let you know shit that I see ya when you working that ass
Make a nigga think later on he gone be twerkin' that ass
And I can tell by the way you throw it back it ain't no hurting that ass
And ain't no room for nothing else in that skirt but that ass
The jiggling shawty, got a nigga shivering shawty
And if you don't know what to do wit you better give it here shawty
Put a bend in her back, I'm throwing the dick she giving it back
I tell her if you ever give me that ass I ain't giving it back
She bouncing her ass, later on I'm a blow a ounce wit her ass
Ride out wit her ass, cut somethin' on the couch wit her ass
Then bounce to her pad, cause you know it ain't no housing her ass
Cause since the first time I seen her, all I been thinking bout is her ass

And I guarantee he go double but if you don't, you in trouble
It's goin' take him three coupes just for him to recoup'
Or witness shawty flop, like the last three groups
While I'm in Cancun' 'round see-through's on a three week cruise
It'll take more than the likes of these fools to make me lose
Sheesh, flopping is something I can't see
Ladies, obey the chorus
Shake ya titties for me please

[Chorus: x2]

Uh, I came to blow the spot
Hit the club wit' cheddar knots
Riding wit' a badder bitch
You gonna get or ever got
Try me boy, you better not
Shawty and I'm very hot
Toting forty cap, forty five nine's every glock
Blow you up in that very spot you standing in
Then vanishing
Undo this manana then, throw away this can and then
Back to popping mo and blow and dro and money handlin'
You and your lil' posse can not stop me and this clan I'm in
While you slanderin', you better ask ya girl who the man again
Turning out a superstar back into a fan again
Damagin' all who peek, line 'em all in the street
I'll do 'em one at a time wit' one line on one beat
Say ya almost gold, that's what I sold in one week
Got a flock of freaks, while you hold on to one biich
I'm like a Pez dispenser, shawty, I spit treats
The nigga who even sound good on a bullshit beat

[Chorus: x2]

Well pussy nigga, you can like it, you can love it
You can bite it, you can dub it
But you can't do it how we does it
When we ballin' in public
Where the grill full of gold or Seville full of hoes
Wood wheels and some Voe's or hun'ed gold spokes
I park at the club and a hun'ed hoes choke
Spark up some dubs, let them hun'ed hoes blow
I run game to get the hoe once they act like I can't run it no mo'
I stunt them hoes broke and her money po' po'
You can't smoke the way we smoke if you ain't smokin' no dro'
Drink the way we drink wit no Hen' and no Mo'
You can't ride the way we ride if you ain't slamming Benz do's
Can't ball wit' me if you got eight but can only spend fo'
You ain't VIP like me and can't be searching your coat
Ain't no P.I. like me if you ain't workin' no hoes
Can't do the shit we do, the way we do wit' no dough
That's like trying to win a ballgame, if you ain't takin no score

Hey, you 'member that broad we met back on the road last year, bout '99?
(The one up in NYC?)
Nah, nah, not the one from New York, I 'memba her too doe
I'm talking bout the one from L.A.
Lil bad bitch I met in the mall wit the big ass
(Oh, oh, that bitch)
Here what she said
(Whats up?)

[Chorus]
I'll meet you at the hotel, we can fuck all night
Do me how you want to, I won't tell nobody
(Shit, let's do it, where you at?)
I said, meet me at the hotel, we can fuck all night
Do me how you want to, I won't tell nobody
(Shit baby, keep yo mouth shut we can do it, sho nuff)

[T.I.]
One day in L.A., I'm at the mall
Picking me up a couple a pairs of silk drawls
And I ran into this fine ass well built broad
She was in hard from a long way
So I'm finna go on swing shawty way
Just like the song say, 'cause I don't play
Miss lady built like a amazon
A 5'9"", light brown, wit some sandals on
The kinda ass that make you wanna grab a handle on
And fuck her all day in the hallway with the candles on
So I wave, and I speak and conversation coo
She asked my name, where I'm from and why I talk the way I do?
I said ""'cause I ain't from round here, I'm from Atlanta shawty, but anyways
We can still get together, 'cause I'm goin' be here for a couple of days""
And then she say, she never been ta Georgia, she was dyind ta visit
Well, I'm in room 312, at the Sofatel, I'm sho that they listed
She got the digits, say she like me, and that we can be friends
If I ain't welcome shawty, don't invite me, ain't no need ta pretend
I'm wanna lick on ya neck, kiss ya ears, and make yo knee bend
Put ya ass in positions you never thought you'd be in
Now, I'm telling you shawty, fucking wit me, like divin of deep end
Have you sneeking, creeping in Georgia, freak on the weekend

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
This time, it was me n KP, in NYC
On some Quevo and Hennessy, and 2 sweets with two freaks
Some of the baddest things in Times Square wit some long hairz, cute feet
One of 'em say she wanna drive me to Coney Island so she can show me the new beach
Couldn't nobody ride wit me doe, cause the car only had 2 seats
Lil' cute freak, in the Z3, remind me of one of my hoes in the GC
Told me her name was Sharell but all of her friends call her Cici
Say she up he a going to NYU, but originally she frum DC
Say she'd love ta freak me, reminisce while listening to my CD
Lay me out on the beach feed me strawberries n kiwi
Shawty say she like what she see, can't wait ta get down hea n see me
Round Freaknik, say soon as you hit the city all you gotta do iz beep me
And let me know what its finna be, the Four Seasons or the Embassy
Get a voice mail round 10 ta 3, and then what she said ta me...

Tell'em how you did the broad shawty

I'm having fun, getting pussy on the run
Bitches coming to my room, tryin' to make me cum
In Cleveland last weekend, O-High Hoe, was really going on?
She said ""Stick it down my throat""
A lotta y'all married, to my ex tramps
She shouldn't worry, I sent the bitch to sex camp
Taught her how to fuck, she made you fall in love
I fucked her real tough, now you can't get enough
Knocking on my door for yo hoe, that's no game pimp
I fucked all them bitches DMX was naming
Fucking hoes from Milly, bitches out in Philly
Puerto Rican, Dominican, New York pussy, ya feel me
I been nationwide since '88
So don't clown when I'm around, keep yo lady straight
Cause I'ma, beat her pussy down in the worst way
You waited six months, and I fucked her on the first date, at the Hotel

T.I.,"Yeah,
To the ladies,
One mo' message from T.I.P.,
I represent every man in America,
No, the world

You want to know what he what he
Thinkin' bout when he ain't
Talking to you bout why he can't
Be your man you sure you want to know

Here it is

[Verse 1]
My girl say I don't love her
She say we just fuckin'
Nothin' against you 
It's just that I hate tux
She want to toast with the Mo' and the ice
Throwin' the rice
Wake up with me for the rest of your life
Ask me where I'm going,when I'coming back when I bounce
Running her mouth, call herself the queen of the south
Redecorate the crib throwing satin on the couch
Catch me out adulteratin' takin' half of the house
Well it ain't she don't deserve it
Just I don't want to give it
The life she want to live
Shorty I don't want to live it
Makin' money shorty's missin'
To all kind of digits
From KeKe's to Chaniques's
To Bianca's and Brigettes's
Poppin' up unannounced, shorty call 'fore you visit
Nothing about a number, mind your goddamn business
Look bitch, some shit bout Tip won't change
We can hang, but I got to let you know one thang

I can't be your man
It ain't you it's me, sorry shorty
I can't be your man
Where I been, I don't see no rings on these fingers 
I can't be your man
Look to the future, find someone better than me
I can't be your man
You deserve much more, I'm no good to you shorty

[Verse 2]
Don't it seem like shit be cool for a month and a half
All of a sudden you frontin' and showing your ass
Complainin' bout what you got
Shorty look what you had 
Before me, it was pull-out couches and Militant bags
Now she mad cause she ain't got a T.V. in her Jag
I tell you what if that ain't good enough get back on the bus
Give up the princess cuts and the Prada and stuff
I take you out to eat and you order a bottle of what?
Ungrateful wonderin' why I'm not faithful
Ballin's all good but this shit is just wasteful
Want me to pay your bills
Help you get a bigger crib 
Shorty I don't mind helpin'
But show some initiative
Ain't brought nothin' to the table but hard times and heartache
Do something, get on the grind for God's sake
A reminder, rewind this message from your highness
For those that chose to take my kindness for blindness

I can't be your man
I don't cheat cause I ain't shit, 
I'm cheatin' cause you ain't shit
I can't be your man
Every time I walk in the house you sittin' on that goddamn couch
You ain't got nothing better to do
I can't be your man
Cook, clean, iron, pay the water bill, shorty do something 
Work with me
I can't be your man
Ay, pack you shit shorty, I'm droppin yo ass off at yo mami house
Right now

[Verse 3]
One more scenario
Bout another jazzy hoe
That I met on the road
After a show in Ontario
Shorty say she got a man
That don't really scare me though
But she say he got a temper
So, but what he jealous for
Cause you told him you were cheating
Hell, well what you tell him for
Shit, what that got to do with Tip
You better let him know
Now she want to let him go
But what for
So you can get with me and keep being a slut hoe
I don't think so baby better stay where you at
I'm no good for you
Never mind the way that he act
You got a kid and a crib with him
What's better than that
I'm in town for the week you better settle for that

I can't be your man
I'm here for 4 days shorty, 4 days
I can't change the world
I can't be your man
He don't treat you right? 
What that gotta do with me?
I can't be your man
He be cussin' you out and shit
You cheated on him shorty, can you blame him?
I can't be your man
You ain't fend to bring that bullshit to me
I don't want none parts of it
I can't be your man
Look here man
Get that shit out of my face
Kick rocks
I can't be your man
I ain't fend to have nothing to do with it
Their will be none of that round here
I can't be your man
Besides shorty you talk to much
I can't deal with it
I can't be your man
You say you work where
Mickey D, get the hell out of here shorty
Man look ay, I can't deal with it
You got too much baggage with you man
You and little, uh,uh,uh little Opus Cunningham
Y'all kick rocks down the damn street
I can't deal with it shorty
And, complain, what, you ain't got what?
Shorty when I met you shorty you was barefooted
Sittin' on the railroad track with some straw in yo mouth
What the hell you complainin' about what you got now
What nigga you got steak and eggs right here 
I'm saying, what the business is?
Get the hell out of here man
Hey man you need to show me some appreciation round here
You in the damn living room more than the motherfucking furniture shorty
I can't deal with that shit man 
Get a damn job
Do something for me
Lazy bitch, All the bad bitches in the world and I had to hook up
With the sorriest hoe in America
Why don't you take the weight off my back every now and then
Why don't you pay a bill
30 damn dollars, the cable bill ain't but 30 damn dollars shorty
Why don't you change the, flip the mattress
Man wash some clothes, change a light bulb
Goddamn shorty, I gotta do every thing round this sun of a bitch

Hey take a good look at me, now picture me unhappy
No cash and outta fashion, not flashing
Picture me doing bad even if I wasn't rapping
Picture me even breathe on the mic not snapping
I'm fire hot not lukewarm, my arms frozen
Picture me in a room full of hoes unchosen
Picture me with no P.O. and no 'dro
Picture pimps walk with some broads and ain't gettin no 'tho

Smile for the cameras, take your shirts off
Y'all niggas acting, take ya skirts off
Hopping bomb-ass nigga and he ain't wanna work boss

There's no vision, lil' ambition
How I feel about these niggas, and my word, are ya kidding?

They think it's going gold having hoes sweating me

Work with legends like, Organo, I.Z., and J.D.
Neptunes, they even flow on one of Dre's beats
Fly to Miami, chill with Luke and we can trade freaks
I freak shows, just peep hoes under shade trees
Huh, but KP say just keep it top-notch
And make sure that the club is jumpin like it's hop-scotch
Floss rocks and in the summer keep the top dropped
Ten thousand dolla work for clo', when I go shop
In the Apollo on them 'boes so the hoes jock
Especially when I rock that linen suit with no socks
In Polo skippers, they undo zippers,
And they shows cock, to show shot shit

I got two uncles, Quint and Man and they keep me straight

My daddy send me clothes and always tell me come and see him
I say alright but still I feeling like my momma need him
They sending letters home from school, nobody read mines
And plus my uncles, doing 10 years F.E.D. time
Then I started rebelling, began crack selling
The littlest thing on the corner wit a Mac 11
After school I hear my momma holla homework
I say alright ma, but look I got my own work
Started interacting wit fiends at the age of 13
Now my momma finding rocks in my socks, glocks in my toy box

Hardheaded man I ain't listen to anything
I'm getting money so, I'm right and I got plenty game
Besides why I need school, I'ma be rapping momma
If that don't work, then I guess I'ma be trapping momma
But hey I promise I'ma make it cause I'm damn good
I'ma get us out this hood and off these can goods
School just a white man game, and it's ran good
At 16, here's my introduction to manhood
Blue lights behind me, damn what I'm gonna do
Cause I got 2 pounds of weed and a 3.80 too
I guess everything'll be alright if I just keep it cool
How ya doing officer, what ya mean why I ain't in school
Can you search the car? Yea but, I rather that you didn't
Besides it's just a waste of yo time cause ain't nothing in it

But what's the good in knowin' better if I ain't tell 'em nothing
I knew I coulda told Cap not to kill shawty
Put down the gun, get in the car let 'em live shawty
You'll probably get locked up, and I'll probably have a deal shawty
Naw, I ain't scared, I'm just telling ya like it is shawty
Could of told Endae, Quint, and Kern, man ya covers blow
Leave that country town alone, y'all needa come back home
Bankhead and J-Rue, I just feel like if I was wit 'em 
They would of never got killed that night if I was 'em
Seem like I could of done mo', said mo'
Why all my partners gotta be dead or in the fed for??
All the time, I just wish that y'all could ball wit me
Sometimes at night I close my eyes, and dream that y'all wit me (damn.)

It's time to leave say my apologizes
Maybe find a piece of god
Seen my whole life flash before my eyes
And now it's getting dark body temp drop
Going in shock prying out of fear close my eyes
Take my last breath and I'm out here
In my life I smoked a lot of weed
Drunk a lot beer sold a lot of keys
But that shit don't even matter here
Somebody said walk toward the light
But I ain't not ready to go
Am I dead is it over you ain't ready to know

[T.I.]
Well now I moving toward the light
And I ain't walling or nothing
I ain't like the shit
Well hell I guess ain't use for me to try to fight
The shit what the business is you god
I been waiting to meet you
And I know I been hearing bout y'all
But like the one day I would see you
But why you let them niggas kill me
You could have done something why you ain't come down there
And shield me when them niggas started dumping
Then he say excuse thy heat
But I control no hate in
And it coming not from me
Well who coming from satin
Oh satin did this excuse me lord
But now my shit list and

Or a piston grip give me a click of angels whip them thought loose the goal
And get piston whipped a lot of die I ain't scared
Who he think he is fuck with tip
I got a a-k two 45's bout 50 clip I'm fixto dip
I ain't borrow shit I'm fixto trip
Put a piston grip and loose thy lip
And then he say two wrong doing make it not a right one a last
Well forgiven me cause
I'm bout to ride out on lufica ass
And all I need you to do is give me
The strength and lord you know I'm need you
With the shit I'm fixto attempt
I'm fix to bust hell wide open fear don't control me
And I'm o.g. hell can't hold me

[T.I.]

The reason y'all niggas had to die too
My nigga bankhead had to realize too

Cause we don't ride we glide
Now I'm strapped and ready folks

When it's on you already know
Farewell bro. mama always told me
I was bad enough to tear hell up
I'm doing this for what you made of
From that time you made the bitch eat the apple
To the time you pick your folks
To put us on the boat and enslave us
Worker that never paid us
Killed malcolm x, martin luther king
And everybody else tried to come down here us
Killed my father that raised us
Kidnapped us from our country
Take your distance in our religional way
Well now it's time for the cadet to busted
We want our spirits and our minds back now
I'm getting mines right now
Pussy nigga lye it down I'm walking

Spreading rounds waving cadet rounds

Although I won't elaborate, I'll say she lick things and get green.
She fuck wit' me because I got big dreams,
And along wit' a face, she think she seen on the big screen.
I give it to her, since she whine and her back hurt,
Then drive her crazy, since she crying and she act worse.

So comparing us is like whine to a grape stain.
My reputation's great, man, I got a great name.
I hate lames, I stay clean, and I break dames.
I like 'em small, or bigger, with a figure-eight frame.
So if she fine I bet she mine, when I find time.
Man, I ain't lying, mine dames I don't wine or dine.
Like clothesline, hos mine, I'm a goldmine.
Hey, I'm the ""king of the south,"" and the throne mine.

Eventually the P$C, hey, we gone take the south,
Then grab the earth by the ankles, and shake the paper out.
Nigga, I'm 'bout my paper route, so I'm gone, make a route.
Anybody blocking my road to riches, man, I'm gone take 'em out.
Keep run yo' mouth, making up you mind, you got's to be's wit' out.

They out of pocket, I'm a lock 'em out, and leave 'em out.
And that don't change, man, season in, season out.
Open up The Source, shawty, and see who just you reads about.
If it ain't concerning T.I., a P$C a see ya out.

T.I.,"I done been locked up with the worsest of niggas
Armed robbing con men and murderous niggas
The dope boys be the first to deliver
Green, brown, or blow, got mo snow than Buffalo in the winter
Think these lyrics is coming from a pretender
If I said it I done seen it or done it
So I mean it when I say you don't want it
Done came a long way from jumping the hundreds (hundreds)
To bagging them quarters, doing shows from L.A. to Flawda (Florida)
In Atlanta, I'm the law and the order, the king of it
Got a throne and a brougham and a broads that's chrome
Calling houses on the water my home, wit no mortgage or loan
If I live in it I bought it and own it
If I'm wit a bitch I caught her and boned it
No question, no less than a week and she's in confession
And I bought no necklace unless I'm investing
No exceptions, I'll open ya closed session

[Chorus: x2]
You ain't hard til you cooking like this
You ain't mob til you fucked wit the click
Or you flipping them bricks
We make music for the broke and the rich
For the hoop and the 6
For the hustlas went from nothin to G

We hustle from 6 to 6 to 6 again
Sell fat nicks for 10 til the bricks get in
Venturing from ATL to Michigan
The talk of yo town, you ain't even worth mentioning
Peppermint tryin' to get another shipment in
And Sam Goody just hit us on the hip again
Got hot shit under our fits that'll pierce ya skin
And the click I'm in some made men, know that
Got a deal now, but I was the shit before that
Toting steel now, but hold my own with no gat
T.I.P. the answer to the question ""Where them hoes at?""
The heat is catching up to niggas running 4 flat
At the club getting crunker than crackers on Prozac
Say you got some dubs on the Lac? Well shawty where the vogues at?
T.I.P. ain't the shit? come on shawty, don't act
I'm the hottest thing ever flowed over 24 tracks

[Chorus: x2]

Some niggas wonder how I made it, I do what it takes
At school I was cool wit the nigga who threw a 22 in ya face
Took ya starter coat and choked ya til you blue in the face
Or you might know me as the nigga who fucked ya bitch and bust 2 in her face
Either way, I'm a winner like the 4 and the trey
You probably never held mo dough than I can blow in a day
Sometimes I'm wearing gold, sometimes I'm riding on it
Between us, I doubled up off my signing bonus
K.P. and Jay say ""Shawty, hey you going legit""
But I ignored the shit, when I scored a brick
I bet you never knew how quick 36 O's'll flip
Yeah I cook it til it bubble up, see how quick it double up
Competition's in trouble I'm supplying the hood
Born, bred, when I'm dead, I'ma die in the hood
Niggas be trying the hood, I open fire in the hood
Shut 'em up, wet 'em up, and let 'em lie in the hood

[Chorus: x2]",You Ain't Hard

Huh
OK, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea
Hey, OK, hey, hey, hey, hey, OK
Come on

[Verse 1]
I never know whether I'm living fo tomorrow or dying fo today
But either way I'm tryin' to move a hundred dimes in a day
They sat that crime don't pay, but I'm gone stay on the grind in the A
With the same ole J's
I know the lames gone say that I done changed no way 
I'm in the gutta everyday tryin' t slang mo ya
In the middle of the trap, we hang the dro blaze
Niggas in the trap ain't changed in 4 days
Waiting on a page that saying the blow came
Instead of us just finding mo ways to get paid
Anyway, in the fire, I done been there homey
Niggas ball, niggas die and ain't shit fair homey
Dem crackers give ya some time and get to sit there homey
My niggas dying, I'll see ya when I get there homey
Hey, Born alone, die alone in life
But right or wrong, folk it's on fo life
Just be better than me

[Chorus]
Shawty, the streets ain't the place to be 
I'm telling you 'cause it's to late fo me
Hey be better than me
Crackers love nothing better to see then young niggas wit a felony sheet
So be better than me
I know ya mamma waiting faithfully on her baby to graduate ya see
You way better than me
Betta than us, better than this, take a chance nigga change some shit
You could be better than me

[Verse 2]
Hey, its rules in the game son, learn it young
When these haters speak yo name man burn dey tongue
Neva be ashamed of how ya live or where ya from
You stack a mill, niggas will see how far you come
Without a gun, you got somethin'll make 'em bar you son
That's a million dollar mind, why, these niggas is dumb
Yea they goin, get outta line, but these niggas is scum
They outta sight and outta mind 'til you visit the slum, stay down
Stay on the grind and yo digits'll come, bottom line
You gotta shine no matter what you become
These streets is 40 percent of yo mind and 5 percent muscle
10 struggle, 10 time, and 35 percent hustle
And trust if they don't burry the scared, they burry the dead
When anticipating pistol play, be very prepared
And if you ain't, find somewhere to burry yo head
Because them hot ones from the choppas tear ya body to shreds
I said

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
In a broke down Cadillac, ridin' high
Not many trusts in this life either shine or die
I'ma live one of two ways, either grind or cry
And I'ma grind it out, even if I'm dying it out
Ain't got no mo than me, so what the fuck you lying about
That man right there, but ain't goin' be when they start finding out
That that bullshit you be talking ain't the real deal
That ain't you blow, them ain't yo cars so how you really live
See what you need to do is take a chilly-willy pill
Go and chill yo ass out, for they deal yo ass out
A bad hand from a mad man, in a mad clan
All them other niggas take a fall you goin' take the last stand
Gnawed in, sawed in, how everybody ball
When everybody else is all in you don't know where to fall in?
Need some Flaw Henn, I'm telling you shawty
And don't be buying none of that bullshit selling you shawty
And all that other shit they talking is irrelevant shawty
Tell 'em, show you the papa, for they show you the cable
You see a whole different nigga when you open them drables
Follow haters nothing holy can saves us
Shawty be better than me

Hey, where the piano at shawty?
Y'all ain't never seen a dope boy play the piano and rap at the same time
Have you?
I'ma show you somethin', dig this

[Verse 1]
I'm 22 and a vet in the game
Say I'm, supercoo', still a threat at the same
Time, rhyme bout the times I invested in 'caine
Pleasure and pain in every aspect of the game
I'm the answer to yo prayers if you prayin' for change
So, I dare you compare us and say we the same
When I'm, climbin' the ladder, they stuck in the same
Mind frame, they accomplishments are nothin' to gain
Eventually, see I'm outta yo range
Except this rose gold glow from my wrist and my chain
I entertain young niggas who slang
Like a picture, no frame, see it's simple and plain
My shit bang, spit flames, put niggas to shame
Flow so insane, lyrics sick and derranged
Now you can't, mention my city unless you mention my name
T-I-P-I-M-P, I'm the man

Hey be easy, you don't want no trouble with me
Just be easy, the drama ain't nothin' to me
Hey be easy, before you have problems just breathe
Hey be easy, you ain't worth dyin', believe me
Just be easy, you don't want yo mama to grieve
Be easy, well mind yo bizness, don't bother the G
Be easy, swear you stuntin' but you frontin' to me
Be easy, behind the scenes or behind yo greasy
Hey, be easy

[Verse 2]
See y'all kissin' ass when I came to leave
Set the standard for Atlanta, rearranged the lead
Okay, so what the fuck is fame to me?
I been plottin' since kindergarten, you's a lame to me
I give the niggas what they came to see
A reflection of one self where they aim to be
As you can see it ain't no change in me
And you won't meet another nigga off the chain as me
I'm so fly, no lie, don't deny it, ya feel it
So inspired by my style, decided to try it yourself
Bet you won't, meet nobody ranked as high as myself
The checks you waitin' on, homes, I can sign them myself
Tote gats, dro smoked that, now I'm high
Seats way back in the Maybach I ride
Through the streets of the westside, I slap five
And throw dubs, show love, nigga

Pull out a light and smoke you (damn)
Pull my coat off I blessed man just stressed man
Just still elementary just a glance couldn't learn it is hurting my chances
Pack pistols just to blast it (blast it)
I put it to second guessers I blast it it just to prove it (prove it)
Mother fuckers get a moving (moving)
I born into hustling I grew up tustling
Gave my muscle in and got into meeting my frail but hell I put my trust in
My left and right hand grinding threw the night
And I keep my family right and see some paper like a white man
Balling in the ninth (and) we holding in the light (and) sippin on worthless
Sprite and you can call it what you like
I call what the fuck I feel play the courts that fucking peel

T.I.,"Hey I'm working here, know what I'm saying
Try to put yourself in my shoes for a second
Its not personal I'm just saying though

Hey look
From when the moon came out 'till the sun came up
I was supplying the days when where they flame up
Our mamas passing, by trying to explain us
Pissing in the bushes like they never house trained us
But, try to understand that's how we came up
You get to know us, you'll love us but you can't change us (naw)
Really we rather be rich and famous
But in the mean time were forced to slang dust
'Dro or crack cocaine, Penicillin to Rogaine
Ecstacy, Viagra, whatever'll get the dough man
I'm tired of people mis-representing my dough man
Oh you think we out here killing for nothing, hustling
For no gain (picture that)

Hey man I'm just doing my job
Hey lady, don't mind me I'm just doing my job
I don't want to make your life more harder, I'm just doin my job
You live here, I work here I'm doing my job

I don't know if you don't know, don't care or can't see
Every time something up in the hood, it ain't me
And I ain't always up to no good and know the crease
And we ain't always gotta pass through the hood without speaking (how you doing)
We ain't out here threatening your lives, raping your children
We just out here staying alive, making a million (you know)
Working hard, trying to survive chasing a mill-ion
You hear us talking loud, just think of this is chameleon
React to the situations, but accusations is still
We vulgarizing you how, hey man you just hurting my feelings (man).
We got lives, we want to live nice too
We got moms, dads, wives, kids just like you
But our options are few it hell in high school
When your helping with the rent lights and the gas bill too
So before you go judging us loving us won't hurt
Yeah under 25, staying alive is hard work

Hey man I'm just doing my job
Hey lady, don't mind me I'm just doing my job
I don't want to make your life more harder, I'm just doin my job
You live here, I work here I'm doing my job

And for you to see what I'm saying, open eyes will help
If you could think about somebody besides yourself
Why you pointing fingers at me, analyze yourself
Quit all that chastising and try to provide some help
Instead of calling the law, you busting my balls
With all due respect, we don't even need to be fucking with y'all (man)
And we can't help it cause it is like this
We don't like it no more than you that we live like this
Always stuck in the grind summertime to wintertime
Cutting school to sell fifty dimes by dinner time
See everything we know we learned from the streets
Since thirteen I've been hustling and earning my keep

Hey man I'm just doing my job
Hey lady, don't mind me I'm just doing my job
I don't want to make your life more harder, I'm just doin my job
You live here, I work here I'm doing my job",Doin' My Job
T.I.,"Huh, hell naw I can't quit, 
Hell naw man we got too much money to be getting shot up
Stay down, Grand Hustle

Look, I'm this far from being a star and just that close to quitting
I never should of came close to missing
But I want to be a musician pimping not a politician
Listen, feel my position it's a rough transition
Plus I'm way too deep in the game to be trying to change
For fortune and fame and glamor I can be in the slammer
Or six feet up under Atlanta
It's a blessing to breathe
I walk the streets with seven felonies I'm blessed to be free
Long as somebody up in heaven who keep blessing a G
T.I.P. will still be blessing CD's
So haters you can see these
Cause I'm back now with something to prove
Everything to gain pimping nothing to lose
I ought to start smacking niggas when it's nothing to do
They too big shoot them in the leg and even the odds
Cause you ain't hard
Unless you ran with Cap and see-Rod
Trapped with K.T. and robbed with J.R
Fucked hoes with D.P
Broke bread with J.G
Switched labels like K.P
Who the fuck did all that, pimp?
Me, even though I'd rather go back to slanging drugs and shit
It's a gang of niggas and bitches really love this shit
I can't quit

[Chorus]
Even though polices hate I'm legit
And rappers hate it cause they know I'm the shit
Hell no I can't quit
Some niggas hating on the money I'm getting
Most of them hate it cause I'm fucking they bitches
No pimping I can't quit
Some niggas hating on the rocks and the rings
Some of them hate cause they know I'm the King
Hell no I can't quit
People hate it when you better than them
They ain't hating start worrying then
Aye I'm winning I can't quit

[Verse Two]
It's been ten years a album and two deals
For real we all know I should have sold two mill, at least
It's all good though I flow for the streets
I do it for y'all
Every weekend see who in the mall
Still in the trap signing your shirts giving you dap
Kicking it with you then get you and your folk in the club
Posing for pictures with girls
Give them kisses and hugs
Pouring out liquor at shows
Passing niggas the dro
One of the realest rappers niggas will know
But niggas be hating
To the point that they be calling the station ?Don't play his record?
But they respect it cause I'm ready and focused
And I see they petty and bogus
I want you to know this
But most of you know this
Niggas in the game ain't real
Gotta stay selling records cause the fame ain't shit
And fuck the units that they name will sell
It'll break your heart to see your favorite rappers lame as hell
I can't quit

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Some of the people some of the times pick with rhymes
But they may not like one of the lines
I'll tell you what
I'll let you criticize me one at a time
Those of you who think I'm too cocky get in front of the line
Whether you don't like my ego or my arrogant flow
Don't like that when you say I'm tight I say I already know
Don't like how I was talking shit before my album could blow
Thinking I need to calm it down be like the average Joe
So, fuck you, them thoughts, and that little house you think I'm in
Get a Benz I'll value your opinion then
Think I give a fuck how many time my record spin
Fuck what you recommend
I'm back again! (Look pimping)
I can't quit

[Chorus]",I Can't Quit
T.I.,"[Chorus: x2]
Don't hate me shawty
But even if you hate me shawty
I still love you
And now I only wish that you could
See that my intentions were good
I still love you

[Verse 1]
Forgave me once, forgave me twice, forgave me three times
I stayed lyin', you stayed down in the meantime
Had my son and turned around and had another one
I broke yo heart when I told you bout the other one
I stay in trouble ha? Ain't got too much to loose
Knew I could loose it all but never thought of losin' you
Eleven years ago I still regret me choosin' you
Meetin' you, pursuin' you and doin' you in '92
You fixed plates, showed yo face at every courtdate
And all you wanted me to do was call when I was out late
How could I let you go? I thought I knew it all
When you deserved the best and more, you been through it all
You think I sold yo dreams, but what I say I mean
Just take it to consideration, I was 17
I'm still the same man, just had a change of plan
Never ask you back and fuck a wedding band
But I still love you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Went from resentin' you, hatin' you, now I'm missin' you
On the realest shit I ever dropped, dissin' pops
I never even thought, to ask my mom what happened
Just knew that you was livin' in Manhattan and I was trappin'
We never had a chance, we was in different states
But all forgiven, you was human and we make mistakes
You tried to make it up, but shit, you couldn't pay enough
You sent me tons of toys and clothes thinkin' you gave enough
But it wasn't though, and you wasn't there
That's all I knew, so I grew up thinkin' you ain't care
I know it wasn't fair, but ay, it wasn't fun
But now what's done is done, no matter wha, I'm still yo son
I could care less if none of yo other children come
I'ma be right there prayin' you live to be a million one
Finally I understand, hustlin', livin' fast
Tryin' to get the cash and settle down and be a dad
You probably never knew, 'cause hey, I never said it
But pops, I'm just like you, I'm stubborn and I'm hardheaded
But now you dead in the ground, no meanin' tellin' you now
But all I wanted was for you to be proud
I still love you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
How could I criticize my daddy on that last verse
Lookin' at my own dirt, you got some nerve
But be that as it may, I got some shit to say
It's been a secret, I can't keep it for another day
I got a lil' girl, not just two lil' boys
And that's been killin' me inside, eatin' me alive
And I can't find the words, nor the nouns or verbs
To express what you deserve, girl you worth the world
But I'm a man and I ain't perfect, if you hear me now
I'll tell you wha had happened, when, why, where and how
Me and yo mama met, we kinda kicked it off
But we wasn't 'posed to have a baby, we just chillin' out
We had a lot in common, almost the same signs
Same goals, said things at the same time
But then we destroyed the situation like the a changed mind
How could I look her in her eyes and holla ""Dat ain't mine""
Her stomach gettin' bigger, and time is gettin' close
Six, seven, eight, nine months and I ain't told mah folks
Not just messiah mama, hell, I had told yo granny
Three kids in two years, baby, daddy panicked
But I ain't ashamed of you, I'm more ashamed of me
It's not at all yo fault, you'd be better off blamin' me
But now I realize, where the problem lies
Forgive me babygirl, I apologize
And I still love you

[Chorus: x2]",I Still Luv You
T.I.,"I been a menace to society
Since when?
Since menace to society
Still refused to become a legitimate citizen quietly
Felt like my labor hidin' me
But here I am anyway
I might be back to slangin' grams any day
And if this record flop
Well I'll be--back
Wit' a bomb of heart
Wit' see-Rod and the squad
This whole industry's a façade
Man this ain't real life
Half these rappers don't know what sacrifice feel like
Man these niggas is all hype
Not even rappin' on real mics
They just get high and say whatever the fuck they feel like
They make me feel like bustin' these niggas one at a time
And I'm still outbustin' these niggas
Hoe pick a rhyme

[Chorus]
Hey, what these other niggas talkin'
I don't believe that shit
I'm the king 'cause I said it
And I mean that shit
Hey, what's so special 'bout him
Hey, he ain't all that shit
I set the city in fire
Have you seen that shit?
Hey, what these other niggas talkin'
I don't believe that shit
I'm the king 'cause I said it
And I mean that shit
Hey, what's the big deal about him?
He ain't even that shit
I set the city on fire
Have you seen that shit?

It's only five rappers outta Atlanta who bustin'
And I'm one of 'em
The other four, you know who you are
But if you gotta think twice
Well shawty you ain't nice
Regardless of your publishing deal
You can't write
I'm the best thing left blowin' breath on the mic
The king of the south
Nothin' else will suffice
You want to bet?
Well put yo' budget up
Match the price
Me and you like putting matches to ice
You won't make it
Before I had a deal
I was still butt naked
God signed this, like keeping' the Lord's promise
The truth nigga
Like Beenie's first LP
You can do a song with N'Sync
And couldn't outsell me
I'm a legend in my own time
A prophet in my own rhymes
A king wit' a concubine

[Chorus]

Niggas like you, a dime a dozen
They come and go
So why I'm runnin' now
And I ain't never run before
Grab choppers, cock 'em and blow
Stoppin' the show
Bet or owe 'em, droppin' the hoes
You just keep watchin' the door
Pop 'em, watch 'em drop to the floor
Fluff his pockets and go
Put a quarter block on his nose
And a glock in his clothes
He can keep his watches and gold
For his momma to hold
She'll be there buyin' the hoes
Before the drama unfolds
They know shawty outta control
Got me hot as a stove
Puttin' holes in yo' Girbaud
Wettin' up yo' polos
44's and Callico's
A black and a chrome
Lettin' loose and splackin' your dome
Hoppin' back in the Brougham
Known for kickin' in yo' door
Wavin' gats in yo' home
Clearin' it out
I'm sorry I ain't hearin' you out
You hearin' about
The squad pumpin' Fe in your heart
Because you know sacrifice
Was near and dear to your heart

[Chorus]

Hey, my niggas
Y'all already know what it is

T.I.,"[Intro]
Want to be your man, please, tell you why
(I know what y'all thinking)
Doop doop doop doop doop doop
(First he can't be my man, now he want to be my man)
(I wish this nigga make his mind up)
Can't live my life, tell you why
(All my niggas man we gonna have be 21 bout this shit you know)
Oh baby, oh baby
(We gonna step out the track for one sec, one sec)

[Verse 1]
Now what I got to say, seal with a kiss
Know I can't be your man why I feel like this
What I need with a woman when I live like this
Different chicks running in and out the crib like this
Maybe five, maybe six, seven, eight'll be enough
Plus the twins make ten but for you I give it up
Set times to the side just for us to live it up
Walking out a rav farm, purple label linen up
It's hard for me to discuss what I had vision for us
Lots of trust, and a crib worth a couple million plus
So what if I got a pass, labeled a dirt bag
By the minute, hearts I broken and women I hurt bad
Might I add Christian Dior and fur jackets
A part of the pack, but still far from a marriage
It's easy to lose balance when hearts just start caring
With the attractions apparent, its hard to stop staring

[Chorus]
Hey baby let me tell you something, come here I need to tell you something
(Tell you why)
Hey shorty let me tell you something, want to talk need to tell you something
(doop doop doop doop doop doop doop)
Lil mama let me tell you something, I want to tell you something
(Cant live my life, without you)
Hey baby let me tell you something, Shorty I've been meaning to tell you something
(Oh baby, oh baby)

[Verse 2]
If I can get a little bit of your time, shorty
I got some shit I want to get out my mind, and I know
You get enough of niggas hollering ya fine (hey
Ask, ask ya friend man, man I got this)
Introductions seem to bug you, them partners of mine
My bad, I know you think I'm probably lying
Then I'ma stop to conversate, relates all of ya time, man
Look, but half of that shit is all in ya mind
Say you should follow your heart and I'm follow my mind
But anyway, when I see yo' face
I'm thinking three or four days in Montego Bay
At the Half Moon, but I know she goin' say
I already have too many hoes, I know
But if I had you, all the dough I'd blow
On eleven karat pink stones trillion row
I want to be the reason why you showing ya teeth
Without a worry in the world when you rolling with me

Hey, let's get away and get a room on the other side of town
Hey shawty, I was feenin' for you
(Was you thinkin' of me, hey, hey)
Hey, let's get a room, shawty we can freak somethin' if you down
(What you would do?)
Hey daddy, I was feenin' for you

Bet they be like ""I know he tired of the nightlife
He want a wife, he just lookin' for the right type""
Yea right, I be ridin' through the city lights
My hat bent, gettin' high behind the 'lac tint
I'm chilllin' with Brazilian women, heavy accents
They black friends translatin', got 'em all ass naked, adjacent
Have relations with 'em many places
Leavin' semen in they British faces
Make'em kiss they partners with it in they faces
Young pimpin' sprung women 'cross the 50 states
Got young ladies requestin' ""What's Yo Name"" on 50 stations
Askin' me what's a pussy popper, want a demonstration
But I ain't waitin' til the second date, I'm so impatient
Relieve'em of they aggravation, take'em rollerskatin'
On them Dayton's, tell'em ""Baby, stick with me, you goin' places""
Go replace'em, draw erase'em out my memory
Moist panties and wet sheets when they think of me

[Chorus]

Yo, yo, uh,
From Miami to Cali, from Vegas to Jersey
Got'em in Houston, Virginia, New Orleans, ya heard me?
All the classy ones like to act like they a virgin
And the nasty ones like when I talk to'em dirty
But I'm breakin' the ice, got'em laughin' and flirtin'
They be, removin' they skirts when they hop in the 'burban
Once the flick start playin' and the E start kickin' in
Her girlfriend lickin' and she beggin' me to stick it in
That's why, I like chillin' with women who like women
Light skinned, Asians, Jamaicans and white women
Indians, Italians, Haitians and Puerto Ricans
They be itchin' for they chance and waitin' in me to freak'em
They say

Excuse me shawty, but I been watchin' you now for a while
Yo whole style, from yo toes to the way that you smile
And I hope you ain't offended by the way that this sounds
But uhh... all I keep thinkin' bout is layin' you down
And I'm, keepin' it pimpin', I ain't playin' around
Ain't got that kinda time 'cause this the only day I'm in town
So come and, chill in the cut if you willin' to cut
And when you, give me a hug I be feelin' yo butt
Now so while for while we talkin', I'm fillin' yo cup
We killin' the bottle, wake up in dirty linen tomorrow
But tell me would it trouble you if we ended up at the W
Sippin' on a malibu pine apple juice and a blunt or two
Now whachu want to do? Opportunity's right in front of you
Know you used to meetin' dudes, dodgin'em for a month or two
But young pimpin' spit linen to the young women
I'm T.I.P., known as pussy popper to some women

Dis for all my niggas who think they hard,
You want to know what's hard(whats hard pimp?)
Going about yo day nigga losing yo life at the end of it
Now that's what's hard (minding my motherfucking business)
Let me tell y'all bout the last day I lived nigga

I'm in the 96 Impala with the gat in my lap
Annihilating any nigga trying to work in my trap
Now see the feds got me tap'd
So to keep 'em off of my bac
I got a crib in the trap and a crib to relax
Now my indictment was a secret and that's the way that they keep it
If I ain't have a hoe giving head to the feds
Coming back telling me exactly what they said 
I'm a dead man walking
Waiting on time in jail
But I'll die before I let 'em stop my mail
Long as I got another ounce to sell
What the hell I'ma bail? a grap my scale
Get another key and I'ma slang my yayo
Niggas on the westside can't re-up because its a drought
So I check the crack house,
DAMN it sold out
So back to the crib so I can check this stash
Ain't sure about how much dope I had
Got a couple keys in the safe right now
Weigh it up cook it up then chop it down
Now I'm ready to go and pick up my fetti
But before I leave the house I can't dip without grabbin my G'z
And my keys to my brand new V put 'em in pocket with the gat to see
Niggas please nigga you holla bout freeze
Put this red dot to ya ass and squeeze
Now I'm dipping bac to the swats
With the 4-4 and a plastic glock
Turned around and I had to stop
Couldn't trap swarn it was cops
Standing there and I still ain't scared
Mac Boney nem must have fled
Only cops is I fear is the feds
On my car flashing blue and red
Damn there they go now its time to dip
Got the 4-4 right my hip
9 millimeter wit a extra clip
Thats what y'all niggas get fucking round wit TIP
Busting at 'em
N cussin at 'em but ain't no shaking 'em
Them bullets that they was busting at me my vest was takin 'em
Making them pigs fall in pain
Turned around 'cause one call my name
Took a hot one to the brain
Yea I died but long live the game",Long Live da Game
T.I.,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
You think them niggas is hot
Well shawty look what I got
(nigga look what I got)
You think I'm lying nigga
Look what I got

Shawty look what I got
Hey, pimping look what I got
Look what I got
My nigga look what I got

[Verse One]
Big wheels still spin when I stop
Presidential roll, gold Rolex watch
With no rocks
I save them for the pinky
Keep you niggas blinkin'
He ain't wearin' platinum, Naw
But I keep you niggas thinking
Mink seats sure to keep a nigga sinkin'
Swear he ain't slangin'
But I know that nigga creepin'
Got a condo, in Orlando
For the weekend
Homes be so crunk in the club
We gotta sneak in
No more room in the V.I.P
They payin' just to peek in
When they leave
They be looking in a car
They can't even see in
And that's just the
Be-gin-ning
In the city that he in
He was rappin' in the cafeteria
But now that nigga serious
Heard he got a CL, a EXT on Spreewells
Several Chevy's on 24's
(Hold up), how many records he sell?
Man I don't know
But he got a label now
Them boys, the PSC (hell)
I heard Atlantic gave 'em a deal for
2 or 3 mill. (ay, shawty)
(for real nigga?)

[Chorus]
Look what I got
A old school, a truck and a drop
So next time you think them niggas is hot
Shawty, look what I got
The respect of the niggas and G's
So next time you say them niggas is G's
You probably lookin' at me
A what, we ballin'
Bought the bar for the broads
So next time you think them niggas is hard
Shawty, look at the squad
I'm buyin' yachts, have the streets on lock
So next time you think yo' peeps on top
Pimpin, look what I got

I'm well known in the hood
Like the dope man phone number
Roll anything I can throw some 24's under
Nigga talk bad 'bout the man
But I shole wonder
Why the dope boys fuck with 'em
And the hoes love 'em
Very little promotions on this album
Never heard of 'em
But it's jammin' like the fuck
Was jumpin' out the stores
Cause I was born in the raid
And I'm made in the streets
I done played in the days
In the shade in the streets
I say I rapped in the trap
With the best in the streets
Shot craps in the back
You know the rest, nigga please
You doin' business with me
You best invest in some skills
I sell slopes of snow
I don't fuck with little blow nigga
Got 80 k's, it's gone take a little more (to what?)
To double up and bring it back
And make a little more (You movin' slow)
And moving slow, now what you take a nigga for?
I'ma cock hammers and 44's
And nail yo ass to the floor
And I ain't braggin', I'm just letting niggas know
Cause the media and radio can get a nigga so
Fucked up
Comparin' me to these niggas little flow
I do a song
Fuck up they whole little show (so shawty)

[Chorus]",Look What I Got
T.I.,"[Verse 1]
I'm either running for my life or I'm just waiting to die
I'm the supplier of the fire if you're chasing a high
It's never, when or why, it's the way that he die
Did he stand like a man till the day that he die
Or was he reaching for guns or trying to run
Or was he outside on the lawn in front of his son
And if ya, running your mouth you can die in the slum
Cause in the, south where I'm from they dying for crumbs
You can die for your Patna's or die for ya moms
Or you could die 'cause your nigga just heard the alarm, just stealing
Or die in a plane they say it's a bomb
When they run it into a tower, they just say it's Saddam
Screaming Allah the moment that it's hitting the building
With total disregard for all men women and children
See niggas get killed when, people mix they money with feelings
I'm filling my money up in the wall some in the ceiling
I'm just one of the millions of niggas who buckin'
It's a war going on and they killing for nothing
We were in denial all awhile they where flicking the buttons
I'd rather be dying for something instead of living for nothing
End of discussion

[Chorus]
Hey, ain't no more talk
Just start killing niggas off till ain't no more chalk
Or no mo' tape, to outline no mo' scenes
Or no mo' crimes, no mo' dying for no mo' phenes
Or no mo' rims and thing's and no mo' green
And no mo' chains and ring's that go bling bling
And no mo' passionate rapping and so it seems
It's just these talent less rappers they all acting
And I know, so ain't no mo' talk
Just start killing niggas off till ain't no mo' chalk
Or no mo' tape, to outline no mo' scenes
Or no mo' crimes, no mo' dying for no mo' phenes
Or no mo' rims and thing's and no mo' green
And no mo' chains and ring's that go bling bling
And no mo' passionate rapping and so it seems
It's just these talent less rappers they all acting
And I know

[Verse 2]
Yeah they said it wasn't no mo' green for no mo' grind
No mo' room for no mo' kings and no more crown to be given but by no means
Am I any more conceited than this game needed
And if I say it believe it, I'm running the region, you see it
Popping and blowing, I'm stopping I'm going
I'm just, telling, you knowing, you sleeping, or hating
And I don't care what you niggas is thinking or saying
About, you know who, the one who say you know what, do you know where
But you the best 'cause you goin' care
Now I ain't think so either, but we know greed'll make ya
Do strange thing's if we ain't people
And if ya, busting bout nothing, than we ain't equal
You just cussing for nothing and poisoning people
And it's embarrassing laughing at all of your songs
And you can hate me right now but you'll miss me 'fore long, when I'm gone

Niggas be tryin' you how?
Hey let them tell it, you was just another guy in the crowd
(Naw, but they be talkin' too loud)
Man you be listenin' too hard
Just pay these niggas no attention and keep fuckin' they broads (Alright)
I know you harder than these niggas (Yeah) and smarter than these niggas (Yeah)
More heart than these niggas (Yeah)
Quit worryin' 'bout thses niggas
(Hey man fuck these niggas I'm from Bankhead and I don't know where you stayed at)
(But talkin' sideways behind my back, I never played that)
(Since you become a payed cat T.I. you been so laid back)
(I wonder where lil' bad ass Tip from back in the day at)
Man that nigga had to stay back there so we could be that
Nigga on TV and FYI we got the P back
Hold up shawty freeze Jack (What?)
""Lame"" I'll never be that (Yeah OK)
Changed my name a thousand times and still a G believe that
(Oh yeah good we go Ki's)
(That nigga from overseas back)
You see what I be sayin' 'bout this nigga (What man? Shit)
I don't believe that
You ain't listenin' is ya?
You got issues I got kids, 2 boys a lil' girl
(Hey I know nigga they my kids too)
You know it's one false move and it's back to the big house
The judge told our ass ""one more time"" and we ain't gettin' out
(I wouldn't say that)
Be thinkin' 'bout standin' outside in the sunshine (Ho)
Watchin' nigga's heads get buck for cuttin' the lunch line
Hey shawty you ain't 'posed to make the same mistake more than one time
(And I ain't made the same mistake twice since uh '99)
Please, boy stop don't get me started folk it's not the time
And let's just do this shit my way get paid and have a lot of time
Plenty fine bitches, who gon' pull shawty you is?
(Man you know Tip got the hoes)
And Tip hoes got gold teeth (What that mean? What you tryna say nigga?)
Mine got jobs, good credit and they own features
(And mine boost clothes, sell 'dro, got the blow cheap)
(I guess it's just depend on what ya like folk) That's right folk
(And I was just kiddin' 'bout them kites folk) Heh, alright folk
(I'm really glad we had a chance to sit it down and rap a tad)
(I admit you had a couple points, sometimes I act a ass)
Hey but it is so important to keep it real though just like ya said
No record deal, no amount of mil' shall go to my head
(And with that said can't nobody tell us shit, so fuck the hatin')

Welcome back to the trap
Niggas back in the trap
Wit another heavy Chevy
Big dope boys and trap
All you rap niggas role out
I trap when it's cold out
Whack niggas flying
But I stay down to I'm sold out
Cause down a hundred ground
Like a rapping in a dope house
Man wherever I be
The feds got me scoped out
Mother fucker let my nuts hang
Block out the duc canes
Cook it to it bubbles
Double fast as a mustang
I know you think you fuck man
But little shorty tuff man
Been a long time 
Since a nigg from Alanta
Spit this nuts game
That's a very few of real niggas
So how could they give nigga
The feeling that a real nigga
Would get around a real nigga
All they do is still niggas ideas
And rhythm with 'em
Holla something similar
Talking bout the hood
Like they hung in 'em
I got a million rhythms
Want em come get 'em
What bitch you pussy nigga
I'm just having fun wit 'em

Still telling niggas
I ain't wholing I ain't crawling 
When the 12 hit the corner
I ain't brolling I ain't rolling
Keep the coat stretch out
Like Carl Louis Hamstring
Stepped on like I'm working
With the damn thing
Dribble baby ain't seen
What I do to a ounce of doe
A whip man on my pager
Like I pay you folks
To whip some more
I'm doper than the fluid cellur
I flip it all up by myself
I give my niggas recipes
So they can turn to something else
They love to work
That's why I keep em coming
Like collections plate 
We flip the cake
We move this shit from Georgia
Baby state to state
Intimidate
Niggas in the city
Who've been moving weight
Nobody loosing weight
They fuck with us
Cause you've been known to hate
Demonstrate
The way we turned the trout
Out in '98
Started out in '95
Started out with nicks and dimes
Niggas you done lost your mind
Thinking you could set up shop
Pimping I respect the game
Lets take this to another block

Pimp squad
Showty still in the trap
When I spot a scene hot
With the man name Jon
And the collard green pot
On a lot of straight hen
And a lot of green pot
Competition in a range
Like he gotta be stop
Well maybe I will be
But probably not
Oh what the blood cloak
You try to knock em out and he sock
Listen to me I'm serious
Thinking how did he not
End up way up
On the top of Detroit
If come where I was
You gotta be pop
And if you really want to pop
And I rather be dropped

In a drop top chevy with the roof wide open
My partners looking at me to see if my eyes open
Cause I've been drank, and I've been smoke
Flying down 285 but I'm focused
Its a four fifty four, where it says I raise comotion
White leather seats, as fresh as air forces
Doing bout a hundred but the track still bumping
Number 8 on nwa straight out of compton
Pull up at your apartment sitting on 24s
And the dope boys, saying the kids running in
The clicks start dealing and the broads start choosing
And the cars been parked but the rims keep moving
Sign pictures by the hundred, to the youngins in the hood
Cause I ain't hollywood, I come from the hood
I'm use to it, if your rear view shaking and your seats vibrating

Since when, since menace to society
Still refused to become a legitimate citizen quietly
Felt like my labor hidin' me
But here I am anyway I might be back to slangin' grams any day
And if this record flop well I'll be back wit' a bomb of heart
Wit' see-Rod and the squad this whole industry's a facade
Man this ain't real life

Half these rappers don't know what sacrifice feel like
Man these niggaz is all hype, not even rappin' on real mics
They just get high and say whatever the fuck they feel like
They make me feel like bustin' these niggaz one at a time
And I'm still outbustin' these niggaz hoe pick a rhyme

Ay, what these other niggaz talkin' I don't believe that shit
I'm the king 'cause I said it and I mean that shit
Ay, what's so special 'bout him ay, he ain't all that shit
I set the city in fire have you seen that shit?

Ay, what these other niggaz talkin' I don't believe that shit
I'm the king 'cause I said it and I mean that shit
Ay, what's the big deal about him, he ain't even that shit
I set the city on fire have you seen that shit?

It's only five rappers outta Atlanta who bustin' and I'm one of 'em
The other four, you know who you are
But if you gotta think twice well shawty you ain't nice
Regardless of your publishing deal you can't write
I'm the best thing left blowin' breath on the mic
The king of the south nothin' else will suffice

You wanna bet? Well put yo' budget up
Match the price me and you like putting matches to ice
You won't make it
Before I had a deal I was still butt naked
God signed this, like keeping' the Lord's promise
The truth nigga like Beenie's first LP
You can do a song with N'Sync and couldn't outsell me
I'm a legend in my own time a prophet in my own rhymes
A king wit' a concubine

Niggaz like you, a dime a dozen they come and go
So why I'm runnin' now and I ain't never run before
Grab choppers, cock 'em and blow
Stoppin' the show bet or owe 'em, droppin' the hoes
You just keep watchin' the door

Pop 'em, watch 'em drop to the floor fluff his pockets and go
Put a quarter block on his nose and a glock in his clothes
He can keep his watches and gold for his momma to hold
She'll be there buyin' the hoes before the drama unfolds
They know shawty outta control got me hot as a stove

Puttin' holes in yo' Girbaud wettin' up yo' polos
44's and Callico's a black and a chrome
Lettin' loose and splackin' your dome
Hoppin' back in the Brougham
Known for kickin' in yo' door wavin' gats in yo' home
Clearin' it out I'm sorry I ain't hearin' you out
You hearin' about the squad pumpin' Fe in your heart
Because you know sacrifice was near and dear to your heart

Hey daddy, I was feenin' for you

Bet they be like ""I know he tired of the nightlife
He want a wife, he just lookin' for the right type""
Yea right, I be ridin' through the city lights
My hat bent, gettin' high behind the 'lac tint
I'm chilllin' with Brazilian women, heavy accents
They black friends translatin', got 'em all ass naked, adjacent
Have relations with 'em many places
Leavin' semen in they British faces
Make'em kiss they partners with it in they faces
Young pimpin' sprung women 'cross the 50 states
Got young ladies requestin' ""What's Yo Name"" on 50 stations
Askin' me what's a pussy popper, want a demonstration
But I ain't waitin' til the second date, I'm so impatient
Relieve'em of they aggravation, take'em rollerskatin'
On them Dayton's, tell'em ""Baby, stick with me, you goin' places""
Go replace'em, draw erase'em out my memory
Moist panties and wet sheets when they think of me

From Miami to Cali, from Vegas to Jersey
Got'em in Houston, Virginia, New Orleans, ya heard me?
All the classy ones like to act like they a virgin
And the nasty ones like when I talk to'em dirty
But I'm breakin' the ice, got'em laughin' and flirtin'
They be, removin' they skirts when they hop in the 'burban
Once the flick start playin' and the E start kickin' in
Her girlfriend lickin' and she beggin' me to stick it in
That's why, I like chillin' with women who like women
Light skinned, Asians, Jamaicans and white women
Indians, Italians, Haitians and Puerto Ricans
They be itchin' for they chance and waitin' in me to freak'em

Excuse me shawty, but I been watchin' you now for a while
Yo whole style, from yo toes to the way that you smile
And I hope you ain't offended by the way that this sounds
But uhh... all I keep thinkin' bout is layin' you down
And I'm, keepin' it pimpin', I ain't playin' around
Ain't got that kinda time 'cause this the only day I'm in town
So come and, chill in the cut if you willin' to cut
And when you, give me a hug I be feelin' yo butt
Now so while for while we talkin', I'm fillin' yo cup
We killin' the bottle, wake up in dirty linen tomorrow
But tell me would it trouble you if we ended up at the W
Sippin' on a malibu pine apple juice and a blunt or two
Now whachu want to do? Opportunity's right in front of you
Know you used to meetin' dudes, dodgin'em for a month or two

I left the kids at the crib, and the squad in the trap
Now I'm in the two-seater with my broad in my lap
The alpines beatin', but I'm far away from rappin'
Bumpin' Prince, Sade, or some Marvin Gaye perhaps, I
Put up my blues, put on some tailor made slacks
Some wing tip shoes, what you know about that?
Button down, cufflinks, hair cut, no hat
Just felt like gettin' clean and show I know how to act
At Neiman and Marcus let my girl blow three or four stacks
Gotta forever to cut the food, and damn I'm relaxed
In a real cool mood, no beef, no gats
But then real close by, niggaz better know that

With my hottie, takin' shots of ? in the Hummer
Known to kick it like we riches, got Richie and Madonna

Or either Will and Jada, on vacation for the summer
Me and my lil' mama, blowin' big as we wanna
Gotta big sack of some of that shit from California
A bottle of Patron and a six pack of Corona
Dro aroma got the six hot steamin' like a sauna
So I let the top back and I bend anotha corner
Check into the W, so I can put it on her
Got the suite for a week, but we can stay a lil' longer
I ain't trippin', that's the shit that make relationships stronger

Put up the vest and the chrome, even through with my phone
My partners don't wanna be on the shit that I'm on man
Livin' life and kickin' it like a grown man
Sittin' in the sand, drinkin' pina coladas
With a double shot of rum, just chillin' right by the water
No judges, no lawyers, in a whole 'nother world

Maybe have my name

Because they, can't keep up with your pace
You're my, super freak! super freak!
You're my, super freak!

[T.I.]
My momma taught me, everything fine ain't the finest
And everything that shine ain't a diamond
They say that change come wit time and I'm finding
That most bitches take your kindness for blindness
Yeah it feel good laying her beside you
Digging deep, ol' nine up beside you
But we can't kick out in public, gotta hide you
Cause all my partners in the hood done tried you
It's true that you can't turn a hoe into a house wife
Well listen shorty maybe I don't want a house wife
They say that you a freak I'm thinking that they bout right
Because that pussy's so good and your mouth tight
A pretty face, slim waist, and her stout nice
Juicy ass that them niggas in the south like
She super sexy, got a nigga thinking bout a wife
Wearing all white, being wit her for life

[T.I.]
The main thing making niggas judge you
Is the same thing that make me want to love you
From the smell of ya hair, I want to hug you
To the way you yell ""give it to me"" when I fuck you
Plus you ain't tripping off a nigga cause he thugging
That's why I'm twice as happy as relationships that wasn't
But my partner say you tricking with his cousin
But nevermind, I don't listen they be bugging
They find it hard to understand how could T.I.P. love
This girl, when her man is out at strip clubs
Maybe cause T.I.P. girls leaving wit girls
And in the morning they'll be waking up with six girls
They don't know we more like homies when we pick girls
Why you worried bout it, he ain't gotta make you his girl
Fuck what he think about you, I think you the shit girl
Make me want to bring another kid in the world

[T.I.]
Now I been told every nigga in the streets know
She ain't nothing but a freak ho
But when I look in her pretty eyes, I don't see it though
Now she done showed me some shit that I ain't seen before
But what we do behind closed doors is for me to know
All in all I've decided I'm a keep her though
I'm a fucking grown man, what I'm creeping for?
Just try me 'bout her folk, that's what I'm toting heaters for
I'd die by that for her a real good reason though
That's how I feel, let my partners and my momma know
Keep it real, all the disrespect has got to go
I disrespect, she is selfish, she don't hide it
Though she may have been a tad misguided
All she need is a little affection, a lot of direction
A nigga wit a constant erection
And I done wasted plenty time contemplating second guessing
Procrastinating, I want to buy a ring and pop the question

Hey, I'm off the scene with Louis the thirteenth
Chains swings to my jeans, and my T-shirt clean
In case you been researching, I'm the King
With a style as mean as the Earth seem
Chest on ice, and my wrist on gleam
30 karats in the ring, money ain't no thing
You think I'm playin' but I ain't joking
The dro king, if it ain't purple, I ain't smoking
Rubberband bank rolls, fifty thousand dollar cheddar knots
Try to shine, is you out your mind, boy you better not
I walk around with more money than you ever got
Shrewd attitude like I never had to sell a rock
Shorty I can get you in whatever spot
Backstage, front row, what I got to front for
I'm getting bored, don't even know what I stunt for
Got a lot of rides, what it hurt to cop one more

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
To all my hot girls, if you wanna come chill
Or roll on chrome wheels, let me tell you what it is
We fixin' throw a little party at the crib
Where the floors tricked out and the rooms like ill
The basement's cool, but the pools unreal
Where that millionaire lives, shit remains concealed
So pop a pill, put on your blindfold
I'm hitting the dance floor, and grab eighty-nine more
Let em' know we on the way where they been trying to go
I knew I had em' when they asked me ""What kind of diamonds are those""
Headed to the spot pouring double shots of XO
Play the ""Love Below"" and watch 'em undress slow
Flicks on the flat screen, make em' want to ""Get Low""
And spit shine this dick of mine until it gets swole
When they kick it with the king, they don't wanna let go
So what you gonna tell a nigga, when he tell ya ""Let's Go""

Our father, who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On earth, as it is in heaven
Give us this day, our daily bread
And forgive us for our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespassed against us
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom
And the power, and the glory
Forever and ever, hmm, amen

[Verse 1]
Man, I'm prayin' for help
While I'm lookin' at the life I left, it's kinda hard not to hate myself
But quiet as kept, right or wrong it's just the way I felt
I might be better off prayin' for death, on my knees I nealt
Still tryin' to find a way to accept, it ain't a way that I can
Help nobody, 'til I save myself, technically I'm still a slave myself
I gotta climb out the grave myself, man I played myself
But when I look at all the fans I touched
I ask how can a man that's done so much, be treated so unjust
Cause I'm tryin' to inspire the folks, you want to be them
Cause they sell dope, well man show 'em the ropes
Be a father or a football coach, a role model or a symbol of hope
Take another approach, instead of testifyin' against them in court
Handcuffin' 'em and closin' the door, so they can be worse than before
Can't you see they only do what they know
Than you wonder why they don't care no mo', life ain't fair I know
But why I'm hated everywhere I go, next time you want to
Compare my flow, just know that I'm prayin' for help

[Chorus]
Askin' somebody else to give me a hand
I'm tryin' hard, but I'm only a man
Man, I'm prayin' for help
Hopin' somebody could see what I see
It's like the hood only matter to me
They got me prayin' for help
Hopin' somebody else can carry the torch
I'm all alone, with no kinda support
While I was prayin' for help
Realized that I don't need nobody else
If God wit' me I can do it myself
I'm tired of just prayin' for help

[Verse 2]
I know it's only one king, one thing, one being
Only somethin' I believe without seeing, and with all my faith
I pray some how, some way, regardless of what anyone say
I believe one day, that I'ma change my life, get right
Start livin' like Christ, 'til the end of my fight
I'ma be defending my strife
Til somebody come and shut off my lights, I ain't never goin' quit
No matter how difficult it's gon' get, and you can bet whatever on this
I'm forever goin' spit, harder than niggas hatin' on Tip
You can take away place it on Tip, If I double my load
Carry it as the trouble unfolds, holds yours
And I better don't fold, put that on my soul
If it takes until I'ma hundred years old, bet I'm reachin' everyone of my goals

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Hey many times, I done wish I could change my mind
Change my life and leave the game behind
And it's been so many days, I done prayed I could find a way
Find a heart and the time to say, only so many are blessed
With so many chances, and so many checks, so many fans
With so many arrest, and it's been so many deaths
So many prisons with niggas in there
And the system keep playin' them to the left, man it's so many tests
So many haters love seeing you stess, but tribulations come with being the best
Still it's so many reflects, singin' by text, when they bringin' the trecks
Sellin' dreams never seem to jex, that's why I'm seeing some threats
So many stripes off the streets I'ma vet, so many rappers get so little respect
Now niggas faith on the shelf, 'cause of the cards that a nigga was dealt
Or the heart that a nigga then dealt, so many niggaz done left outta the hood
Made a way for them-self, instead of givin' back, they stay for they self
So many playin' they self, instead of readin', educating they self
The ones who won't even pray for they self, they got me prayin' for help

T.I.,"[T.I. Talking]
I got a question for you hating ass niggas out there, hey
Why you mad at me,Ay
Oh lame ass nigga why you mad at me
Sucker ass nigga why you mad at me

[Verse 1]
Remember late nights earn stripes servin straight white
Talk shit slap box clear into the day light
Might fuss may fight but stay tight
Keep what the ""J"" need for the lighter hit the base pipe
If the trap was the ocean or the sea
You could consider me and them the killa whales and great whites
Before a nigga tried to click it make them think twice
Cause they knew Cap would kill a nigga fo blink twice
Day right I'm reciting my life
Nigga I was there no matter what through sirens on a silent night
Cold Sundays slow Mondays hot Friday nights
Tuesday Thursdays serving whether or not they ride tonight
On peaceful days hostful evenings even violent nights
Chip on my sholder hold a grudge cause you can die tonight
I swear you niggas had no idea what my life was like
Before the bright lights and a half a mil just to grab the mic

[Chorus]
Is it cause I came from the bottom to the top
Why you mad at me
Maybe cause I Spent a hundred on a drop
Why you mad at me
Is it cause I kept it pimpin and stayed down
Why you mad at me
Or is it cause I am the a town
Why you mad at me
Is cause you a lame and I'm a ""G""
Why you mad at me
Is it cause I got love in the streets
Why you mad at me
Is cause you know yo time running out
Why you mad at me
Is it cause you know I'm king of the south

[Verse 2]
Niggas mad cause I got it like this
Gold on my wrist hoes on my dick, my dick
But I could give a fuck about this industry
I'm a be the same tip til the end of me
That's something you know automatically if you a friend of me
Question that will think other wise now you offend me
I came in this game not looking for a friend or enemy
Found them both now that niggas in to me
Got little rap niggas liking into me
Major labels and police want to censor me
Feds on my ass cause I'm in the streets
Think I still slang listen to lame niggas who lie to snitch on me
It ain't my fault that you can't picture me
Riding in a phantom and I swear I never fathom
All the fame that a nigga can gain from Atlanta
Now I'm just trying to maintain for Atlanta
Before niggas would say in Atlanta
I was Rhode Park Doug High stayed in Atlanta
Now true enough I sold yay in Atlanta
But is that compared to contributions I made to Atlanta

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
A pick a reason any reason all excuses would do
But man you lucky I ain't bucking like I used to do fool
While you was throwing one's and two's
I was lifting up tools and then
Shoot at his shoes just to see if he move
Or either bust at his head to check if he dead man
Don't talk around cause I heard he the fed's man
They offer him time and they knowing he scared and tell him
Give me they names or you doing the stretch man
Or wear a wire go record what he said
And then you can tell his lawyer that his clients a dead man
A rat I'm smelling blow I ain't selling
Where you got that impressing ain't no telling
Yes I'm a felon why was that in question
What about all these records I'm selling
I'm Bankhead born and Bankhead bread
And when a nigga die I'm gone be Bankhead dead

(But she's a freak though)
She got angel eyes, wit the baby face
(But she's a freak though)
I want my momma and daddy to meet her
Maybe have my baby
(But she's a freak though)
They keep talking about you
Because they - can't keep up with your pace
You're my - super freak! super freak!
You're my - super freak!

My momma taught me, everything fine ain't the finest
And everything that shine ain't a diamond
They say that change come wit time and I'm finding
That most bitches take your kindness for blindness
Yeah it feel good laying her beside you
Diggin' deep, all nine up inside you
But we can't kick out in public, gotta hide you
'Cause all my partnaz in the hood done tried you
It's true that you can't turn a hoe into a house wife
Well listen shorty maybe I don't want a house wife
They say that you a freak I'm thinking that they bout right
Because that pussy's so good and your mouth tight
A pretty face, slim waist, and her stout nice
Juicy ass that them niggaz in the south like
She super sexy, got a nigga thinking bout a wife
Wearing all white, being wit her for life

[Chorus]

The main thing making niggaz judge you
Is the same thing that make me wanna love you
From the smell of ya hair, I wanna hug you
To the way you yell ""give it to me"" when I fuck you
Plus you ain't tripping off a nigga cause he thuggin'
That's why I'm twice as happy as relationships I was in
But my partna say you trickin' wit his cousin
But nevermind, I don't listen they be buggin'
They find it hard to understand how could T.I.P. love
This girl, when her man is out at strip clubs
Maybe cause T.I.P. girls leaving wit girls
And in the morning they'll be waking up with six girls
They don't know we more like homies when we pick girls
Why you worried bout it, he ain't gotta make you his girl
Fuck what he think about you, I think you the shit girl
Make me wanna bring another kid in the world

[Chorus]

Now I been told every nigga in the streets know
She ain't nothing but a freak ho
But when I look in her pretty eyes, I don't see it though
Now she done showed me some shit that I ain't seen before
But what we do behind closed doors is for me to know
All in all I've decided I'm a keep her though
I'm a fucking grown man, what I'm creeping for?
Just try me by the four, that's what I'm toting heaters for
I'd die by that for her a real good reason though
That's how I feel, let my partnaz and my momma know
Keep it real, all the disrespect has got to go
I just respect that she herself and she don't hide it
Though she may have been a tad misguided
All she need is a little affection, a lot of direction
A nigga wit a constant erection
And I done wasted plenty time contemplating second guessing
Procrastinating, I wanna buy a ring and pop the question

Advances on the throne, I ain't never take it lightly

How many rappers you know that could hold they own on White street
East steady talkin' on the cell phone nightly
Normal population, half the jail just like me
Polices think I'm crazy, scared a nigga gon' strike me
Contrarily, a nigga tryin' me is unlikely
They barkin' don't bother me, I'll be bombin' 'for they bite me
They just shocked to see my rap's exactly how my life be
Shiesty, with a conversation quite pricey
My fist so rocky and and wrist so icey
Might be, thrown off my rocker just slightly
Fiesty, claimin' hot temper don't ignite me
I'm only gonna ask ya find the exit once politely

I'm grown nigga, so let it be know we ain't equal
You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' I can't reach you
Beat you, to a fuckin' pulp if I need to
The very spot ya standin' in then is where I'll leave you

Still stackin' and buildin', you still rappin' to children
Jeopardizin' your deals, caught up buyin' your wheels
Like its back when we was little and its still time to kill
Quit displayin' your skills, way underpayin' bills
Spend a day in the Ville, on how you saying you real
Niggas could never live how I live, you ain't deservin'
My lifestyle's urban, never met me in person
Just my bread suburban, in a red suburban
On 24's, 20 hoes giving head, I'm swervin'
Fuck boys pissed they pants, scared nervous
I'm shell-shocked, black eye, like I been in the service
Clean, cut, and preserved, but I told George Gervin
The closest thing your hoe seen, to picture perfect
The rolls gold king, my ring tight as a virgin 
The dream I stop 'fore I seen the top (nigga)

Funk you niggas, Dominique slam dunk you
Niggas sucker punch down one of you niggas
I was being nice at first, now I'm runnin' through niggas
Whole crews, not just one or two niggas
Cause you ain't representin' the south, you just embarassin'
See you on t.v. in New York, them niggas laughin'
The reason why D.J.'s ain't have a clue I was fabulous
Now days not playin' my record well, hell its hazardous
All this cussin' for some loud discussions, outta my character
Bussin' these niggas melons, and threatenin' all of they managers
P.$.C.'s Atlanta, so how you playin' and handlin'
Gorillas with bananas without playin' and banishin'
King of the south, it was said once then
Took a while to comprehend, that all sunk in
On the low deal a mil, I ain't done come again
Room dead, scene fled, 'fore the feds runnin' in

Every crack and every alley sellin' crack
And every time diggin' hairier
Every Kim, Sue, Sally, til I tally up
A big enough knot to buy me a yacht
So then my pistols and my partners really all that I got
I'm not, playin' at all, I'm sprayin' 'em all
This K'll chop 'em down to size, 'cause they say that I'm small man
Pussycats can't worry the dog
Keep throwin' stones at the throne, I'ma bury you all man
Know, you fagot niggas hate that I'm ballin'
Makin' 30k a day and blow it all at the mall, and man I
Can't relate to what you rap on stage, nigga

Vanilla want a nut on Sunday
Fill hot fudge in the middle of her tummy
Butter pecan white chocolate love day
Niggaz looking fly so remember where the hershay
Hoes at Davana of the scanna
Pussy split on my banana
Take they pic on who they gone sample
To Michigan back down to Alabama
Popped hypnotic be the flavor
That water their jaws for the milk they shake up
Captain save em
A.K. just gone lace up the beat
To be a suckers favorite
Top it off for the celebration
After I bang her I'll let you cake her
You were too seet she needed a banger
Make her melt let it drip through her fingers

Sexy, gorgeous, beautiful
Would you do something real freaky tonight

Now I'm in the limelight
This rose gold bring plenty dikes
They come around to service me because they know I lay the pipe
I'm running wit the king we in different cities every night
Broads stripping out they clothes before the D.J. pass the mic
Puerto Rican mama citas, Asian bitches mixed wit white
They come to see the P$C in many skirts and see threw tops
I love this life
That's main reason I ain't settle down ain't got no wife
I'm down wit the squad
Done wit the hard
I be pimping these hoes for the rest of my life

Sexy women freaky ladies
Squeezing T.I.P.'s Mercedes
Kissing women, eating ladies, lick 'em till they driking babies
Like Rick James was in the 80s young and rich and living crazy
Kisha, Kim, Mari, and Kayla
Love to keep the reefa blazing
And the new and imitated
Lou that's hollow point fim that's playing
Actually they demonstrating
Orally Administrating
Conversation here 'em saying
Pills'll make you fill amazing
Wish I could do this everyday
Anticipating this occasion

'Cause real recognize real, and real you ain't never been
You never will, I catch ya where you chill,

Lock up all these niggas, the penitentiary mind frame

Stand up

[Verse 1: T.I.]
You got a gator mouth and a hummingbird ass
Your mouth writing checks that your ass can't cash
145 and I'm out of your weight class
Want to survive, you better scramble like eggs and break fast
Cause I know how to handle your fake ass
I'm a ride on you and hide you in yesterday's trash
Pull up in the Chevy's spraying rounds through the glass
See you laying face down in the grass and I'll laugh
Ha, cause that's the end of the saga
The end of my problems, nigga mash the Impala
Go lay up with a model and watch the news tomorrow
And that's the end checkmate, game over, I'll holler
Pimp, telling you partner, you don't know what you're doing
Or recognize the trouble you getting in to and you're ruin
And dig this man
I spent my childhood in a wild hood
And all that gangster shit you talking, yeah, it sound good
But make it understood
You gone have to show me, I'm a O.G.
You want to overthrow me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Trick Daddy]
Dearly beloved, we're gathered here today
To marry this young nigga in his own special thug way
Do you promise to love and respect all of the real niggas
And when a problem come, learn to deal with 'em
Do you swear to turn this chopper
On any motherfucker in your path, or the bitch that's trying to stop ya
Or do you promise to keep him handy
And don't hand him to nobody, nobody except family
And keep him cocked and loaded and don't expose him to no body
Unless somebody, who want him in his body
To love and cherish and from this trigger to a barrel
From the bottom of your heart
'til death do you fuckin' part
Do you understand to live, to lie by him
Is to share your soul, Lord knows, you gone die by him
I know you heard gun stories about John Wayne and Billy the Kid
Shit, all them motherfuckers dead
And did you know that every other bitch from the Wild, Wild West
End up dying from hollow points to they fuckin' chest
Cause I ain't never seen a cock beamer meant for a team of tummy guns
With a hundred round fuckin' drum

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
Shit, I'm talking about riding out tonight
Only way I die first, got to kill me in this verse
Weezy F middle finger to life
So nothing seem critical in the hood I'm typical
Yet I'm feeling good and spiritual
Healing hoods with this shit up out my kitchen
I'm pitching that it's really good
Smoking, drinking, I'm like a fish
And I'll probably shit on ya bitch
Probably piss on her lips and she probably give you a kiss
Nasty, Holly Grove classic
Polly wood a nigga probably robbed the same bastard
Ask him
We don't give a fuck about a casket
Nigga this the murder campy
Niggas is murder happy
12 years old, I jumped off the pot
I started selling rock right after I got shot
I had to hold my weight down
Pussy nigga stand up or lay down

If ain't want no trouble leave, shit, shoulda left the man alone
It's been seen, shown and evident Atlanta's known
Tha King been the one representing all of Atlanta's zones

Back when niggas was representing Atlanta wrong
Every shot he got, he put the hoods of Atlanta on
The big screen then hit every trap and traveled on
Past, present to Texas to Alabama strong
(I'm tha King)

Down in Miami, up to Louisiana homes
From the Carolinas, Virginia to David Banner's home
I'm well connected, haters, best to mind ya manners homes
I got a nickel-plated 38 but hey, the hammer chrome

And it shine like ya should set the phantom on
In it see me riding, getting blown like the saxophone
Hey shawty, spit the shit, it takes to cut a candle on
If I ain't on ya tube, dude, you must got ya channel wrong

I'm tha King of the South, there is none flyer
Sucker MC's outta call me sire
Ya songs okay but I'm on fire

I will not stop and I won't retire

I came, I saw, I conquered with no big names

No fame, no celebrity sponsors
Just a game and a flow that was bonkers
Nigga, front if ya wanna
Dead niggas like the bitches from 'Monster'

Now you been told so don't say I ain't warned ya
And don't let it alarm ya when ya leaking then the reapers upon ya
Speak on me and I'm creepin' upon ya, say that I ain't tha King
But you just sour, you ain't think of it aren't ya

All the hating, is no time to respond, I miss tryin' to conjure up
A way to get experience and launder
Hey, I thought ya record company conned ya
Into signing a deal, shy of a mill 'cause they really ain't want ya

Moving yay, it's safe to say that they own to ya
So it's time to move on to real estate
And get cake selling big estates
(I'm tha King)

I'm King of the South now but it's fifty states
I'ma spread out and I'll eliminate, who in the way?
(I'm tha King)
I'm 24 today, give it to, I'm 28
I'll be ruler of all that I survey and not just in the state
(I'm tha King)

See, I bend just to win but I ain't finna break
Most you niggas fake and I'll say it in nigga's face

I'm tha King of the South, there is none flyer

One reason why me and other cats is hard to compare
Cause I'm fact, that's fiction, it hardly compares
Bein' hated part of the game, pimp it's hard but it's fair
Well I'ma be the best, hate me, see if I care
But just know I'm raisin' the bar and I'm keepin' there
And I'ma still ride clean, blowin' weed in the air
With 2 or 3 bad bitches got they feet in the air

Hit the gas, poof, I run out the tailpipe
Tailpipe that's all these hoes wanna lick for the night
Treat them like Tina beat the pussy in the ya car and be alright

Get you runnin' like Vick
What the fucks on ya hood

Tell em where im goin', im steppin' out
Singin' on the high life
Windows up in the clouds over nothin'
On my counsel that's where I got my gun as for that 
After that get the finger role and blow one
I got the violent bitches make em freak fuck all night
Hoes know killers on the Westside
Earn stripes make the money turn right
This the kid just to get my peeps and my grillz swirvin'
Off church street all the pimp blockin' the street

I was born up in Bankhead
Dro you all remember me
Way back in 83', T.I. stayed on the street for me
Just cause I'm from Bankhead, niggas havin' beef with me
Half never seen a G, in the cap of my beamer v
10 screens folded, my Chevy watchin' enemy
Ridin' down 6th about the West rockin' and leanin' on me

On 26 inches just to get my roll on
On a Jesus songs on, make them bitches get low
I get that ass raised up, like Dr. Dre six four
Hey, come up in my hood, bet them bitches know Tip
If you tell 'em you wit' him, all them bitches gon' strip

Hello [Repeat: x9]

[T.I.]
Hey, what's happenin'?
It's been a minute, huh? I'm just hollerin'
How you doing? 

It's been a minute since I seen ya,
I fell off for the scene, 
Cause it seem like you wanted other things than da king,
Why you fightin', fussin', cussin', and disagreein' wit da king?
When you got cribs, cars, bling, and a king wit da king?
Is the grass as green as it seemed in ya dreams,
Are you getting all the things that you needed and I ain't bring,
Does it satisfy your self-esteem being seen on the screen,
Is this new nigga the real thing or is just a lil' fling?
Did he buy a nice bracelet and get ya a lil' ring?
Or give you all the attention and the lil' things?
He know what to do with the stuff you stuff in them lil' jeans?
Do he stand up and lean in it 'til you start screamin'? 
Or smack your ass and kiss your G-String to start eatin? (muah),
You get how you need it, not only when it's convenient,
I just pick up the phone and call you every week or two to let you know I miss you,
To see how that other nigga treatin' you.

[Chorus: Governor]
I remember morning, noon, and night, 
I used to hold you tight,
I know we used to fuss and fight ,
But I'm just calling to say (hello) Hello, (hello, oh baby)
See time has a funny way of keeping us close, 
Even though we never stayed, toghether,
I just wanted to say (hello) hello (hello)

[T.I.]
Hello?
Hey, it's me,
Hey, what's happening? How ya doin?
I know plenty of niggas pursuin' them panties, all for the screwin',
Fly you down to Miami,
Let you walk the red carpet wit a ? at the Grammys,
But I'm what he can never be, a boss, understand me?
He pose and take ? things he buy for ya,
He got you a rose, but that don't mean he'd die for ya, 
Hey, maybe I got too much pride to cry for ya,
But not too much to call you and tell you that I adore ya,
And tell you how I'm missing you, loving you, and kissing you,
And think about the good old days and wanna visit you,
This song I'd like to listen to whenever reminisicin' you,
You, stay on my mind nevermind how I picture you,
Think about the past and all the time that I spent with ya,
Rubbing on that ass from behind as I dig in you, 
Never been a doubt in my mind that I was diggin' you,
How I love you shorty, you'll never find another nigga to

[Chorus]

[Governor]
Every now and then I think of you, 
And I can't lie I be wantin' you,
But I understand that I'm not your man,
And I also know that the future's not in your hands 
Every now and then I'd call you to say how you doing,
And baby I miss you,
Girl, this is just to say hello,
Hello Baby.

(Hello, hello)",Hello
T.I.,"So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears
Wish you were here",I'm Straight/Pimp C (Skit)

And the prophecy read that
One day like the phoenix rose from the ashes
That a boy will be born unto a family in the slums
This boy will go on and use the knowledge that he gains
While fighting for survival in the streets
To become a crack leader
And in time that boy will grow to become King!

[Verse 1]
Time to ride nigga (Just Blaze!!)
I welcome you and get acquainted with the youngest in charge
Respected from East to West like he was running the mob
Dictating, ain't taking orders from no one but God
I know you niggas is broke 'cause I know what you charge
Them niggas wishing for a Phantom it's one in my garage
It's black as legary right next to the black Ferrari
You niggas ain't getting money off of rapping I'm sorry
Fuck the rep went and spent 60 large on a Harley
'Cause where he stay 10,012 feet not hardly
Now you see that we ain't able to compete, now are we?
And pardon me I'm giving you the Westside story
Of the A, where I stay and niggas stay down for me
You want to play, have you gay niggas lay down for me
And get a order for killers to spray rounds for me
Competition, you ain't considered; you rapping, you bore me
You reppin the A horribly
Must I say more importantly

[Chorus: x8]
The king back!

[T.I.]
Hey, man y'all niggas got me way too fucked up, you understand that?
What you need to do is homeboy
You need to go back and grab I'm Serious you know
You need to get familiar with Dope Boys and see where
all these niggas got they style
See where that trap shit came from
Then you need to graduate to mother fucking in the Streets Vol.1-3
Then you need to go to Trap Muzik, I got locked up for a second
Then grab Urban Legend and now to bring you up to speed

[Verse 2]
Who knew you could fit on your wrist a whole pound of diamonds
I'm number one on the list while you clowns are climbing
Wishing to be in positions that you found that I'm in
Since you niggas do what it say I'm world renowned than sign me
If Jay handled the clay and around the time
I delivered a bad day when 4 5's were spiraling
I care the least about police and the fireman siren
Ambulance ain't goin' stand a chance in reviving
DOA amend the beef will cease upon my arriving
Paramedics yell clear and your flat line silent
You ain't ready for out here 'cause the lifestyle violent
You think you is, you must be living on Fantasy Island
Your mammies mad, get your ass wiped out like Thailand
Hit my phone and got what left and hit the three while you following
You say you want to release and go to war with the finest
Need you be reminded, want it with Your Highness?

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
Hey man I know y'all niggas still in the trap everyday
Still man I know y'all don't see nothing but the projects nothing but grits
But listen
Make no mother fucking mistake man
I still will shoot up my mother fucking self, AK and
45 nigga on side nigga
And come see 'bout niggas you understand
But I don't want to do that 'cause I respect that shit y'all doing
I started that shit
I made that shit cool
I made these niggas want to be you nigga
Nigga respect this shit!",King Back
T.I.,"What's happenin', man
This T.I.P., you know 
I'd like to dedicate this song to anybody who done ever lost somebody
To the grave, to the streets, to the jail cell
I done been in situations where I done had to cope with all three 
You know what I'm saying? 
I feel like the only thing I ain't done yet is died, you know
But it ain't how I live while I'm here
It's how I live when I leave, ya dig?

[Chorus]
Life's up and downs, they come and go 
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folks who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die that I live in the sky
It's true what goes around comes back, you know
So when I die, I hope I live in the sky 
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky

My cousin Toot ain't have to die right in front of his son and his wife
He lost his life struggling over a gun
Give a damn what he done, that's my motherfucking folk 
And I love that nigga to death, no motherfucking joke
I can feel my eyes feelin' the lord is my witness
If I catch 'em, I'm a kill em 
I made it my business
Back in the day you stayed in my business
Taught me I ain't have to incorporate yay in my business
Coincidentally that's why today you not wit' me
My cousin died over some yay, and I miss him
Plus he had his family out, let's say she the eye witness
But her boyfriend did the shooting judge gave a life sentence
I heard that, now I'm dressed up in all black
Shot up the whole apartments and still ain't brought back
The best friend I had in Jamel, I lost that
I guess your death was a lesson in life; it taught me that

[Chorus]

Never seen a nigga go to jail and sleep till day two
Well, that's how sick I was when Jayrue
Found out the hard way that wasn't powder that they were tootin'
Overdosed on heroin, died at twenty-two
If you ain't heard about your daughter, she smile just like you
So cute, even resorts to violence like you
You know ya baby mama loose, but, ha, what can you do?
And I got four myself 
Yeah, it's been a few
Now everything I do is for king, messiah, Dazasha, Demonte
Tell them lord they all I got, so please don't take 'em from me
From me standin' in the trap wit' Qerin and Sir Kap
Laughin' at the niggas who serve with no strap
Tell them niggas, man, y'all trippin' wit' no maps
Get robbed and that's the part where my pistol ain't no help
Me, you, and the crew just fell out over dough and a little crack
Never could apologize 'cause you died; that's why they say that

[Chorus]

I bet you niggas think I'm living it up
Till you see polices laughing as they pickin' me up
Went from seeing how many bitches I can fit in the truck
To three hots and a cot; is you kidding or what?
Fuck how many millions I got, nigga, so what if I'm hot
When I got prices on my head, Feds rushing my spot
A million haters want me dead, forced to carry a gat
But you's a seven time felon, what you doing with that?
It's a Catch 22, either you lose or lose
That's the way the game structured for real niggas to suffer
And I ain't never been a busta, always stood on my feet
Like a man prepared to take whatever coming for me
A pussy nigga or polices wit' a warrant for me
I'm a ""G"" prepared to die for what's important to me
Look anybody in the eye who say he want it wit' me
Put up the house and bet the odds if coming from me
OG's say I need to learn to be patient
You telling me wit' these seven years of probation
Pistol charges, and a host of other open cases
If niggas only knew the kind of time I was facing
I tried to keep to myself but sometimes I couldn't take it
Got four kids, the smiles on they faces
Mean more to me than my crown and my bracelet
Take that away from me and my life is butt naked

T.I.,"Hey, I know you done kicked it with a lot of niggas before
But you ain't never kicked it with a nigga like me
Hey Hey

[Chorus]
I see ya baby, throw ya hands up high
If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy
Because the rocks go glisten and the drops on 20's
Bend it over let it drop if you wanna roll wit me

I say all my sexy ladies throw ya hands up high
If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy
Because it don't get better, niggas don't get cheddar
Like that fella in the yellow, purple label? sweater

[Verse 1]
The stones keep glowin' on my wrist like whoa
And she can't stop lookin' I know ya bitch like those
And she chose, ain't no question if ya bitch might blow
Just get her to the crib and get her whole back so (sore)
I'ma blow my dro', I'ma pop my peel
Ask anybody wanna take a shot, I will
Might see me in a different color drop, hot wheel
With the top down low, and the glock concealed
I got my niggas who be racing up the block, One mil'
If the police try to chase me you know they a done deal
I got skills, anybody wanna come test
Bet send this .45 will be up in yo chest
A lot of ladies wanna kick it with a nigga so fresh
He could spend a 100k, any day, no stress
The watches is insane, the chain is grotesque
Stay single if you wanna but you gain no cash

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
If you got a man and you're tired of being there
You done gave him too many chances, you're tired of being fair
I give you the opportunity to ride with a player
You, me, and a couple of freaks in the ride with a player
Nevermind those outside, when they stare
Cause the chrome 24's on the ride give a glare
Because of one guy, you decided to share
As long as you having the time of your life, who cares
Man, we all sinners, what matters is in the center
I know god see its hard, and I'm a stand up nigga
You can't beat me 'cause you ain't man enough nigga
I look him in the eye and tell him man up nigga
You really getting money? Throw a grand up nigga
Wanna fight? You should've hit me when you ran up nigga
Really swift, don't waste a hammer, body slam fuck niggas
Go and kick it with the hoes and throw ya hands up with 'em

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You ain't know me 'cause I live so special
Try to stay low key but it's still so special
Flat screens in the floor, quarter mil' in the dresser
Jewelry box glowing like I loan on treasure
I'm chillin' with Vanessa, met a girl named Heather
Told her ""Hi, how ya doin'? Buy a drink? My pleasure""
Told her if she got a home-girl go tell her
That I got a hard rug, I could go for-ever
If Vanessa wanna touch it just let her
If she laughed out loud, I'll be shocked if we just met her
Bought the dro', get low, and its only one-fifth
And it's four peels left, do you wanna come with?

[Chorus]",Stand Up Guy
T.I.,"[Intro]
Grand Hustle Pimp,
Hey, whats happening shorty
Me being a true player and all
I mean you know as a stand up guy you know
I really hate to say I told you so
But, man I told you so
Back when we said we were going to run this shit man
When we said Pimp Squad Click, Grand Hustle was the business
When we said their was a whole another side of Atlanta
Another bunch of motherfuckers in the trap, y'all didn't know

[Chorus]
Man, I told you so
They thought a pimp wasn't supposed to blow
Because I was rapping about moving o's and blow
Pimp I told you so
They thought that Outkast closed the door
And Ludacris came in and sold his 4?
Man, I told you so
The Mac, C-Rod, Kuntry and Dro
And AK had the coldest flow
Nigga, I told you so
I said the future was right up under your nose
You thought the south wouldn't explode no more
Remember, I told you so

[T.I.]
Way back when Kriss-Kross was hollering ""Jump"" on ya tube
They was still getting jumped at school, we used to tote them tools
Don't get me wrong I'll give respect to them dudes
But approach us wrong, and we'll smoke them fools, ain't no joke it's the truth
Fuck a hater, let 'em do what it do
I'm busy now, but I'll be through in a few
And then I'm coming for you
So keep shit talking like it's something to do
I'll spend a 100 grand get a killer something to do
I been hustling since 92' when I heard UGK
Hollering ""Pocket Full of Stones"" I was on my way
Had a history in the yay, before I started to trap
13, let me take you back farther than that
When my uncles was bagging blocks, used to count the stacks
I was only 8, and my grand-daddy can vouch for that
And my pops had a lot of work, a lot of folk he got 'em work
And ran numbers, said if he ain't wanna, he ain't gotta work
Why I sold rocks, I guess I got from pops
My uncles Quentin man and Stan a chip off the old block
The nigga you hear now the same one from off the old block
Who used to stand on Front St. and get off the old block

[Chorus]

I remember the P$C, Killer Mike, David Banner and me and YoungBloodz
Ran through Atlanta with heat, when even Atlanta was sleep
Nigga, back before you heard of me
I was middle man into serving keys when KC was serving 3
I'm on top because I deserved to be
So simmer down, calm your nerves at least
Speak your words with peace
Before you lay out on the curb deceased
Think about it, it's absurd to beef
I took my songs to street
He told me dope boy was the bomb in the street
Since then, my name rang like alarms in the street
Who knew how long it would be
If only LA knew how wrong he could be
I told you ain't nobody stronger than me

[Chorus]

This southern rap shit of the day is something I helped design
Puerto Rico of the mix show I'll let you know who the next in line
The Snowman, Paul Wall, the Thug?
A lot of other niggas shouldn't of even been signed
That's a opinion of mine
Because these niggas be neglecting the grind
Ain't waiting on nobody to let me shine, I'ma go get me mine
And then they wonder why they checks behind
Cause TIP was 20k? back in the day, need me to press rewind
What be on these niggas mind, man don't get me to lying
I seen ya kind, dope boy, and that ain't even ya kind
Ain't never sold a gram of crack, and ain't no need of ya trying
Back in the trap, pimp I don't see him surviving

[Chorus]",Told You So

And the thugs and the killers was all in class wit' me
SS's on twenty-sixes, watchin' some television
Shorty, I'm never slippin', got the berretta in vision
And ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to trippin'
Ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whippin'
Pimp stolen' the automobile, and the roof for the tag missin'
Polices try to pursue me; it's nothin' but gas-given
Addicted to fast livin', yes, I'm one of my dad's children
Think I'm bad now, you should a seen me before I had children
Give dick to ya daddy's daughter and they oughta have children
Hope he got some insurance 'cause I definitely have some endurance
Kill her in Mississippi and drive her ass to Missouri
Still my wet pet drippin' while I'm woodgrain grippin'

Young niggaz filthy rich, and we ain't worried 'bout much
On this glock I clutch
In God I trust, if a punk nigga start, bet his heart I bust
Got ya partners and the broad in ya car fucked up
What ya under estimation thought a star wouldn't bust
I got the heart and the guts on this perp I blow
Move ten bricks daily, tryin' to twerk five mo'
Ya see the Cadillac swervin' down Hollywood Road
On the flyest bird in Cali, fuckin' Hollywood hos
On a pill and half with my partner Young Dro Dro
Bumpin' Goodie Mob Soul Food number fo'
Other rappers', old dudes, told dudes I'm a pro
With a loaded fo' fo' and a quarter brick of blow

'For I spit a hundred rounds and have everybody bailin'
I got some bitches in a Benz and my partners in the Chevy
And now we ridin' Giovanni's and Asani's on Pirellis
If ya ever think ya tryin' to run up on me, just forget it
The clip in the chopper long as ya leg and leave ya shredded
Pistol way in the truck, and my knife on tuck
Ya think he ain't gettin' stuck, you got life fucked up
A couple stiches in ya hip will have ya night fucked up
Will he live?  Will he die?  Guess he might luck up
Meanwhile, I'm racin' my Ferarri like a light for a buck
Against Lamborghini Gallardo every time I get a car

Alright man, y'all win
I won't say it, at least for this song, hey

Said they looking for the realest, well I'm real as it get
Rap to the nigga dealing hard who live in the jects
Til some better nigga wit her, ain't delivered 'em yet
My mouth is, but I got a pistol bigger than that
I live and die by my respect so I honor the code
Peep niggas who be out here flexing, stunting for hoes
And if you ain't never chose to remember nothing before
Just know the game is some you win, some you don't
But you already begin again, start, it go
Learn to shoot a pistol, flip a O, how hard it go
Man if you ain't ever heard of Pimp Squad before
You better ask a real nigga or a broad you know
Cause you ain't ready for the pros, get it outta ya brain
You in over your head, way out of your lane
I been saying I'm filthy rich and got it from caine
So would you say them niggas know if they done got it the same, right?

[Chorus]
Cause you know who, you know what
Of the you know where, going against us, too unfair
Cause everywhere you do a show, we got kinfolk there
And now you know I ain't no more, not a tinfolk there
It's you know who, you know what
Of the you know where, beef now don't you go there
And if you do, don't use our copy producers, he won't care
If he leave the hood alone, pimping he won't share man

I know you think you out there getting it in
But what ya doing, I done did it once and did it again
I had a trap between running while living in sin
He done settling down, turning nine milling or ten
I give a damn if I never sell a million again
I gotta thank you a million for just letting me in
But now I'm settling in, getting used to the view
On top, won't stop til I'm huger than you
Goin' flop? Who? Me, pimp you losing your screws
We gotta dope if you letting niggas shoot into you
You ain't ready for the shit I'm introducing to you
The roof in the back of the park ain't translucent as you
So now your nigga dressing up, man do what you do
I got style, pimp, it's more than just the suit and the shoe
This been proven, I'm the truth, stamp government seal

I was born into poverty raised I the sewerage
Streets always would be a part of me, it made me the truest
And even when my days were the bluest
I never ran from adversity, instead I ran to it
Fear ain't in the heart of me I learned just do it
You get courage in your fears right after you go through it
Now I come through in a Coupe on 22s
That ain't bad for a nigga who ain't even finish school
Don't get me wrong I never been a fool
I just put off graduating for a pair of tennis shoes
I used to use the beat to paint my pain
But nowadays man I can't complain
I got several automobiles and they all on thangs
Several size of tangent and they all in one chain
Used to see me in the mall I'm the same
And get a couple broads giving brain on the plane

I come from Chi-Town lost and found in the struggle
Where dudes say stay safe and stay out of trouble
Speak is muffed the law and be	 gon try to cuff you
Those with duffles move weight and have muscles
I came through the dirt with a verse for the people
Open up for Daddy Kane and Easy up at the Regal
The radio rarely put their needle on my record
They ain't see how the hood and heaven were connected
Sounds projected, ain't show how effective
Lessons learned, sessions turned to life reflected
And everything I found real in life know I kept it
They say life's a teacher, you're gonna get tested
When a nigga changed they keep saying that nigga strange
Couldn't see how my mind won't be the lame
Ahead of my time I caught up with the game
Making good music making paper making change

I put on gasoline drawers I stood in the fire
With enough heat to set the hood on fire
Man you niggaz think Suge was off the wire
You should've seen the squad before I had Messiah
We assumed the title as the number one supplier
Felt like I was selling blow since I was in diapers
And wish a nigga would come try us
We was cool with the killers, best friends with the lifers
Quick to up and scrap with niggaz who want to deny
For what we considered then as a lucrative empire
But like that pimping time flash by you
Now I wonder what the judge think as he reading my priors
Prison ain't full and the reefer ain't bias
You ain't got to tell and distant the liars
Gave the jail hell and shot birds at the hearse
Lived through worse and reversed the curse

Taught me how to number run, I went from that to number one
Had a hundred ones, I bought a slab flipped another one
Sold my little three-eighty east, and said I need another gun
The littlest in the trap, and gotta pack of ice and bubble gum
Junkies hatin' on my stacks, sayin' I'm nuttin but a young
Buck, niggaz say, ""What?"" Then he see me raise up
Just wanna see the little boy wit' nuts exchange old niggaz whole face soon
'Cause I spray the nigga's whole face up, wet the nigga from the waist up
They try you once and you pull a fall, and then tell 'em shaw' don't play wit 'em

I'ma gangsta in the game, go ask Lil' Wayne
Ask Judge Johnson, how many times he saw my face
For, ""pistol here, pistol there,"" ""violation here, violation here""
Betta ask Rank, I ran the jail when I was there
I held it down, where-ever I go
When I'm in the A wit' the +King+, or in Detroit in the snow
I'ma pro, whether it's movin' snow or movin' 'dro
That's between me and you, I can get it for the low

[Pimp see - talking after song ends]
Say what it do? Young Pimp see know what I'm talkin 'bout?
Yeah, nigga want me to speak on some ""king"" shit, know what I'm sayin'?
On the cool why'know.. young nigga T.I. jumped out there
Said he was the king of the south
He ruffled a whole lotta niggaz' feathers
But niggaz didn't really understand what the nigga was talkin 'bout
Why'know.. and uh.. so everybody had it twisted but..
Me I understood from the get go
That what the nigga was tryin' to put
In these motherfuckin' stupid ass niggaz' faces!!
Was the fact that it's a whole bunch of kings down here
And as long as you takin' care of yo' business and doin' king shit you a king!
What these niggaz shoulda been tryin' to do was tryin' to get close to the nigga
And get some understandin' about the type of game
He was tryin' to put in these motherfuckin' niggaz' ear holes!
Understand what I'm sayin'?
So I'm layin' back I'm watchin' the game from the sideline
Know what I'm talkin 'bout?
And I'm seein' all these ol' pussy ass niggaz out here
Talkin 'bout they this and they that, but they really ain't doin' nothin!
'Cause they motherfuckin' paper ain't right
When I see them in the street, they diamonds fake! Know what I'm talkin 'bout?
They shit ain't cut right, ya shit ain't right!
Shit cloudy and chipped up, know what I'm talkin 'bout?
And them niggaz talkin 'bout they ""trill niggaz""
Don't even know what the motherfuckin' word mean!
Know what I'm talkin 'bout? This comin' from the O.G. style trill
Know what I'm talkin 'bout? Not these ol' fake ass niggaz
Tryin' to come on the scene later on and tryin' to take glory for some shit
Some other niggaz paid dues for, know what I'm talkin 'bout?
So this is what is.. we bringin' Georgia and Texas together
All you ol' BITCH ASS NIGGAS that ain't down wit' the play
Move on to the side, all you old school rappers like 'Pac say
You niggaz flabby, lookin' like Larry Holmes
BACK YO' BITCH ASS UP!! And, and, and, and move around for the South
'Cause it's our time to shine, know what I'm talkin 'bout?
Now let's do this shit!",I'm Straight
T.I.,"Country had fronted me twenty keys told me to keep 20 G's
And forgot to tell me twenty five to eternity.
Now picture me, in a GS3 with all my fold
Versaci Coat, and Armani lobe from slangin' coke.
This ain't no joke situation nigga I'm I'll with it
My occupation clockin' six figures so deal with it.
My mob be cannon, pealin'? over Teflon protect my belly
From nine millimeter cannon while talkin' on celly's daily
Niggas frontin' 'like they makin' pay
This is real pimpin', key comin' straight from the C.I.A. and Bill Clinton.
You kinda thugs ain't got a clue do you?
Hey who the man who supply the man who supplying you with a couple grand?
Interracial freedom for some luxuries This ain't the bet.
Nigga materialistics can't substitute for your happiness.
Life's about how you feel about you and what you do
When you waking up in the morning you seeing who?
I think you niggas done bit off more than you can chew
Cause you don't even know why you do half that hot ass shit you do.
Why I'm trappin' 'cause it's the only job with fair taxes.
Keep a nigga in tight to death in Polos and air maxes
I'm blastin' these niggas daily whenever they try to play me
Baby you wanna lay me, but baby you gotta pay me.
Nigga you owe me cheese, that's ground for beef
I'm rollin' with the P$C with a pound of chief.
Hey if this rap shit don't work, I'm stuck slangin' drugs, 
Until I make enough money to go and buy me a club.
I got thirty six ounces that I got to move 
And twenty keys comin' to me on the fourth of June.
Soon as the school year ends, I pick up my keys
So crank the V12 to down to females and place em with cheese.
Two hundred G's for the package, but they 10-5 a piece now.
On the streets they goin for 21-5 at least
21-5 times twenty Look that's 4-30
But listen closely cause the dope game get more dirty.
If I cut em into ounces, 28 grams for 800 a piece
Hey thirty six of them in a key, more cheese for me.
Now there's 28 G's and 800 cash just for one key, 
And I got nineteen more stashed.
Two hundred and eight G's at eight hundred times nineteen more, 
Come out to 5-4-7 comma 2-0-0
That's 547 G's and two hundred
Forty seven G's you can ball 200 get blunted
The other 500 G's invest it in keys
So I can triple my cheese and have a million at ease.
That's how it is, this game ain't no life time deal
You better get as much cheese as you can and get the fuck outta here.",Drug Related [Non Album Track Explicit Version]
T.I.,"What's happenin', man
This T.I.P., you know 
I'd like to dedicate this song to anybody who done ever lost somebody
To the grave, to the streets, to the jail cell
I done been in situations where I done had to cope with all three 
You know what I'm saying? 
I feel like the only thing I ain't done yet is died, you know
But it ain't how I live while I'm here
It's how I live when I leave, ya dig?

[Chorus]
Life's up and downs, they come and go 
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folks who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die that I live in the sky
It's true what goes around comes back, you know
So when I die, I hope I live in the sky 
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky

My cousin Toot ain't have to die right in front of his son and his wife
He lost his life struggling over a gun
Give a damn what he done, that's my motherfucking folk 
And I love that nigga to death, no motherfucking joke
I can feel my eyes feelin' the lord is my witness
If I catch 'em, I'm a kill em 
I made it my business
Back in the day you stayed in my business
Taught me I ain't have to incorporate yay in my business
Coincidentally that's why today you not wit' me
My cousin died over some yay, and I miss him
Plus he had his family out, let's say she the eye witness
But her boyfriend did the shooting judge gave a life sentence
I heard that, now I'm dressed up in all black
Shot up the whole apartments and still ain't brought back
The best friend I had in Jamel, I lost that
I guess your death was a lesson in life; it taught me that

[Chorus]

Never seen a nigga go to jail and sleep till day two
Well, that's how sick I was when Jayrue
Found out the hard way that wasn't powder that they were tootin'
Overdosed on heroin, died at twenty-two
If you ain't heard about your daughter, she smile just like you
So cute, even resorts to violence like you
You know ya baby mama loose, but, ha, what can you do?
And I got four myself 
Yeah, it's been a few
Now everything I do is for king, messiah, Dazasha, Demonte
Tell them lord they all I got, so please don't take 'em from me
From me standin' in the trap wit' Qerin and Sir Kap
Laughin' at the niggas who serve with no strap
Tell them niggas, man, y'all trippin' wit' no maps
Get robbed and that's the part where my pistol ain't no help
Me, you, and the crew just fell out over dough and a little crack
Never could apologize 'cause you died; that's why they say that

[Chorus]

I bet you niggas think I'm living it up
Till you see polices laughing as they pickin' me up
Went from seeing how many bitches I can fit in the truck
To three hots and a cot; is you kidding or what?
Fuck how many millions I got, nigga, so what if I'm hot
When I got prices on my head, Feds rushing my spot
A million haters want me dead, forced to carry a gat
But you's a seven time felon, what you doing with that?
It's a Catch 22, either you lose or lose
That's the way the game structured for real niggas to suffer
And I ain't never been a busta, always stood on my feet
Like a man prepared to take whatever coming for me
A pussy nigga or polices wit' a warrant for me
I'm a ""G"" prepared to die for what's important to me
Look anybody in the eye who say he want it wit' me
Put up the house and bet the odds if coming from me
OG's say I need to learn to be patient
You telling me wit' these seven years of probation
Pistol charges, and a host of other open cases
If niggas only knew the kind of time I was facing
I tried to keep to myself but sometimes I couldn't take it
Got four kids, the smiles on they faces
Mean more to me than my crown and my bracelet
Take that away from me and my life is butt naked

Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, do that?

So you could give back his ring and the key to his place
Tell the nigga one thing that you need ya space
Tell the niggas one thing you don't need to chase
I wanna kiss you everywhere between ya knees and waist
Hear the sounds that you make and get ya knees to shake
Holla at me in the A, you feel you need to escape
Got a mansion and a gate, you wit' me, and you safe
There's a phantom and a truck wit' 23's to skate
600 G's in the safe, how much cheese it take?
This a chance you need to take, it ain't no need to wait
Say the word, we can leave today, it's somethin' special, and it feel like fate
Hate to make a mistake
How the same thing makin' ya sad makin' ya stay?

[Chorus]

Can he touch it like that and make it feel like this
How he left and came back, and it's still like this
Do he hit it from the back and make you feel it in ya chest
Take advantage of what you concealin' in ya dress
What, he think he too fresh to show you that you the best?
Compliment you on ya intellect and treat you wit' respect
Make you sex till you sweat, tongue kissin' on ya neck
It's been a while since you got it like this I bet
And I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this not yet
Know you confused, ain't decided which way you should go yet
So how you keep sayin' no when ya panties so wet?

Hey,
This nigga playin' mind games, man
I think the time came that ya mind changed, ya understand?
Life is like a chess move, you need to make the next move ya best move
Keep it pimpin', ya understand?
Hey,
I mean, you know I'm sayin' 
I showed you how I feel, you know what I'm sayin'

Howdy do motherfuckers its Weezy Baby,
Niggas bitchin' and I gotta toke the cannon.
Listen close I got duct tape and rope,
I'll leave you missin' like the fuckin' O'bannons.
One hand on my money, on hand on my buddy,
That's the A-K forty seven made his neighborhood love me.
Bullets like birds you can hear them bitches hummin',
Don't let that bird shit, he got a weak stomach.
Niggas know I'm sick I don't spit I vomit,
Got it?
One egg short of the omelet.
Simon says, shoot a nigga in his thigh and leg,
And tell him catch up like mayonnaise, um.
I'm the sickest nigga doin' it,
Bet that baby.
These other niggas dough I'm wet crack baby, yes.
Get back get back boy this a set back,
Clumsy ass niggas slip and fall into a death trap.
Them boys pussy, born without a backbone,
And if you strapped we can trade like the Dow Jones.
Wet him up, I hope he got his towel on,
I aim at the moon, and get my howl on.
Some niggas cry wolf, I'm on that dry kush,
And when it comes to that paper I stack books.
You heard what I said,
I can put you on your feet 
Or put some money on your head.
Life ain't cheap,
You're better off dead.
If you can't pay the fee,
Shout out my nigga fee.
See every mother fucker at the door don't get a key,
You outside lookin' in, so tell me what you see.
Its about money its bigger than me
I told my homies don't kill him bring the nigga to me, yea.
Don't miss, you fuckin' with the hit man,
Kidnap a nigga make him feel like a kid again.

Blowin' game by the quarter weed over in the Rover nigga

And I'm on that Philly fire shit,
Then I come fully equipped.
You try me get bodied keep the shawty in the whip.
If a nigga try to stick me I'm a blam him.

Got the green and got the tan got the whole enchilada.
Homie know I'm inside of your house,
Tie up your brother.
Make the prick call up your mother 
She might know where to find you.
I am, on top of my job
The heavyweight champ of the flow
Its flow like the ocean, open water you drownin'
I will, four pond 'em 
And sink them heat 'em and leave 'em stinkin'.
Sharks surround them and eat them nice then know that I will.

Do it for my daughters and my youngest son's mama who
Go buy what she want because she know it ain't a problem to
You do something to them and to you I'll bring the drama to
You do it for a day or so, we do it for a month or two
I do it for my partners, go make sure them niggas stuntin' too
We do it with them choppers, ain't no problem, where you runnin' to?
I do it for the block, that why ain't nobody stoppin' me
I do it for my pop and my cousins too, they watchin' me
I did it nonstop, now see how these niggas copy me
I made it from the bottom to the top where I oughta be
Who do it did good and do it did fresh
No matter what I do you know I do it to death

Now do it, (you better) do it, (you better) do it
Hey what you waitin' for?

T.I.,"[Chorus]
Hey don't ya wanna be high? 
Hey listen baby come fly with me, take a ride, get high with me. 
I know you wanna be high. 
You never wanna say bye to me, if you ever come fly with me. 
Hey don't ya wanna be high? 
Hey, listen baby, come fly with me, take ride, get high with me. 
I know you wanna be high. 
Promise you'll never say bye to me, if you ever get high with me.

The bucket's on tilt, truck is on stilts 
I did another deal today, at least a couple mil'. 
No I'm askin' you to chill, wanna pat that down I'm tryin to pick you up 
And never put your ass back down. 
Get rid of all your worries, why you draggin' that around? 
Here pop one of these and now pass that around. 
Fire it up, take a shot, now your ass in the clouds. 
Can I bend ya over, throw your ass back down? 
No need sayin' no, we way pass that now. 
I ain't them other niggas, just control the flashback now.
Make three wishes, you can have that now. 
Fuck the finacin', payin' cash right now. 
Miracle man, make your dreams come true. 
Take a ride, get high, bout time you come too.
Bet ya life done changed, ya likin' my last name Done 
Had a couple babies, with a Bentley and a Range. 
Crib on the water, eatin' meals on the plane 
And ya life in the sky like you lived on a plane. 
So much good shit to fill ya brain, 
If the band seem strange, I'm just sayin'

[Chorus]

You see me chillin' out, kickin back in the ride, 
With fly broad on the passenger side. 
Got a nice smile and immaculate eyes. 
Fore' she get inside, she don't have to decide.
Cause she can have it like she want it, we can do it like that. 
And I went and threw it to her and she threw it right back. 
She say nobody gave it to her like that, Hit it from the back, 
I figure you would like that. 
Her head and tight pussy good like that 
And damn she ain't even from the hood like that 
So she probably never kicked it with a cool nigga other niggas had her, 
Didn't know what to do with her. 
Intimidated by her face and her cute figure. 
Cause her waist real small and her ass way bigger 
Don't she know that if I want her, I ain't finna play with her. 
All I gotta do is spend a A with her

[Chorus]

Hey what it is, pretty girl, 
Would you like to come and kick it with a nigga for a night or two 
And you can take your clothes off if you like to. 
And it don't matter 'bout the cost if I like you I just do it shorty, 
I ain't gotta try t. Bust a move, bet ya I can set a fire in you. 
Me chase round behind you? Why boo? 
I'm like you, you know you fly, but I'm fly too. 
You know how to do it, always ride good. 
Match the paint with the wheels, the trunk and the hood. 
You dealin' with a real nigga, get it understood. 
I'm still in the hood, even when in Hollywood. 
With my beat down low and my top let back 
You lookin' for a G. well you got just that
Well I can be a King and you can be my princess Baby all you gotta do is say yes.

The men trying when you see 'em boy you have to be great
The pistol hit you in the face your teeth they have to replace

With two revolvers in my pocket pitchin' handling rocks

I am the number one customer at my own car lot
You want to know how much money I'm makin' just imagine a lot (10-20)
I'm probably making more than you'd imagine I got (30-40)
Listen closer I need to know if you understand me or not
Because you disrespecting me you and your man will be shot

Riding in a car you probably never seen in the states
No idea how much yay' I can bring in the states
You can get a hundred on 'em four million a day
Frank Lucas ain't the only one who made a million in a day
But it's an American gangsta right here in your face
And you don't want to see PSC in the scene with AK
You think you runnin' up and robbin' that ain't even the case
Just 'cause you get away that don't mean its OK
You a dead man walkin' and I mean it OK?

Ball on these niggas being broke is not an option

Do it to the maximum, take it why you asking them?
Don't listen to them suckers when they say you too irrational.
See I said I'm a king and them lames started laughing
Saying sucker now I want the king on the track
I composed several classics
You know like top back, dope boys,
Bring em out, and what you know about that
Now they ask how I talk what you know about that
Dominated '06, now I'm going right back
See me reign hell, let 'em show me like that

Ain't nothing changed but the name on the mill
Still kicking doors with them thangs in the air

I will slang cane, no such thang as a jail

20 rounds of missiles have you pissin' in your underwear
I tote a pound, 40 cal, so you better tone it down
I suggest you adjust the bass, except for when it going down
A-town, west side club, you should catch me,
Right up at the top where Big Kuntry, Dro and Mac be
Jackers lying say they caught me slipping how could that be
I'm something like a stalker I be everywhere the strap be
The trap be, jumping with that 100 dollar slab
If I wanted nigga I could get 100 on the tab
Sell em all double down nigga do the math
Think I won't pull up in something With 200 on the dash

Do it for my daughters and my younger son, momma who
Go buy what she want cause she know it ain't a problem to.

Take a young'n who's aspirin' to get him some change
Won't nobody hire him so he get in the game
Went and bought a 50 slab, divide it up into ten
Sold 'em all, double down, did it again

You sellin' dimes to forty fiends buy it and bounce
Throw some money to your momma keep some food in the house
Cop the outfit and the Jordans on the day they came out
Betta get ya self a pistol know the jackers is out

Now once you flipped a couple o's know the game get gravy
Take twelve fifty go git ya two and a baby

You should get back five or six that night Stack that money and repeat that twice
Buy you somethin' to ride in, ya gotta be tight
Next time you buy somethin' take twenty-five hundred
Get four and a half it come back in nine don't it
Now stay low key when the money keep comin'
Keep some niggas on ya team to show these suckers they don't want it
By then your connect will clearly see you on ya grind

I'm a cop that thing
And I'm pop that thing
And the shots gonna stay
The nigga bout to set the trunk wit me
For the most part nigga your stuck with me
I'd tell you something if you was really smart
And you knew better

Don't fuck with me
Front if you want mothafucker
You can catch it

Even if I got a ratchet
Aah Pop off police pull me over
Believe I got a compartment
And now gotta stash it
Must I just remind ya niggas
When I come through
Know that I am a fine ya niggas
Take two break through
Bust so many shots
Come now I'll probably blind y'all niggas
Now okay
Lets go see you don't really want to feel a mobs search blow
Clap up a nigga then I cap up a nigga
When I finish this shit we'll turn it into an obsearch yo
Look, Listen, then you better observe yo,
Listen to the sizzle from the bullet that the glock burst fro (sss)
Should a probably tweaked you up just a little
And had your body leanin, lookin' like a quarter past four
Stay down better, (stay down) checkin' for a nigga who can put yo body in the dirt (ooh)

Paparazzi they be follow me (they all be)
Hopin' that they get a shot of me
It's my swag (they wonder what's so special 'bout him)
(Why they ain't sellin' records like him, tell 'em)
It's my swag (how he always look so cool)
(That why everybody do what he do, tell 'em)
Gotta be my swag (they wonder why he wear his hat like that)
(When girls see him why they act like that, hey, I don't know)
It's my swag (for some reason all the real niggas love him)
(Even though they girlfriend wanna fuck him, I guess)
Gotta be my swag

[T.I.]
Gettin' money in Frisco, wearin' my raincoat
See I'm gettin' wet, and this bitch in the same boat
I came in the game slow, they act like they ain't know
That I wasn't gon' leave until I got what I came fo'
I still can't complain though, as long as I ain't broke
I came a long way but shorty ain't nothin' changed though
I still let the tool go, don't get it confused bro
Run up on me wrong, now what you think I'ma do bro?
Send you to your maker, then go to Jamaica
Or either to Cabo, I chill at my condo
My swagger is perfect, hatin' on me ain't worth it
Guarantee you boy, the Earth my turf, if it hurts

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
Regardless what haters say I'm as real as they come
I'm chasin' that paper baby however it come
I'm singin' a song and movin' yay by the ton
I bet you never seen a nigga gettin' money so young
How I get from the pen', all the way to Berlin
I've been to Switzerland skiing and pimp I'm goin' again
It ain't nothing to catch me in the south of France
In a coffee shop smokin' dro in Amsterdam
And ain't nothin' to fly, all the way to Dubai
St. Barts, St. Lucia, any day we can try
G-5 to Moscow and they say I'ma lie
I'ma ball like a dog 'til the day that I die

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
This is impeccable pimping
You couldn't duplicate this shit if I told you how to man
Ha, y'all niggas keep up
By the time you get to Puerto Rico my nigga I'll be in Cuba
By the time you get to Cuba I'll be in Haiti
By the time you get to Haiti I'll be way over in Africa man
You know what I'm saying? South of France in my land man

Five different hoes in Cadillac four door
Niggas think they gonna attack, I got a mac on hold
I'll bust ya in your stomach leave you back on the floor
You see T.I. and Nelly on it, know the track gone blow
Man you niggas barely pro, I don't even practice no more
Aye shawty I was gettin' dough when you was rappin so-so
When you barely had flow I had crack for the low
You can stunt for the audience and act for the hoes
Let me ask you what you gon' do when we ain't actin' no more
Aye when I finish wit you you ain't even gon' be rappin' no more
Aye ""How he doing?, Where he at?"" somethin' they ain't askin' no more
Aye picture me not bein' the main attraction no more
That's all the talkin' I care to do to you back to the hoes
Baby drop it back it up til you can't back it no more

Got an ill technique, in makin' ya knees weak
A non-stop treat until your g-spot leak
To your G4 seat, we'll be back next week
So tell that lame ass nigga you got places to be
So give me your participation, don't need no hesitation
Don't want to be mistaken, ma I'm plannin' on relations
Yea, you rollin' wit the King and the One
Country niggas in the Chevy passin' Grey Poupon
Man, we been gettin' dough since we was way too young
The record sales was the mob that'll make me a Don
You see this is why I'm hot, and this is why he not
So mama climb on top, and show me what you got, aye

All the way down and where your gold leg

You never bought us head
What you get behind the mic and just said
The people already know I must say it!

[Chorus]

You damn right
These niggas don't have rights
To rap about the shit I did every night
Did you win every fight
You ever went to jail for selling white
May barbick and trap same night
Your know these niggas lame right
I'm speaking on it cause it ain't right
Nigga died I survived I done earned my stripe
Went to jail came home
Twenty times got it right
But still trying keep for shootin' sucker niggas I don't like
'cause the game feel like the real niggas on strike
This sucker get a deal now he living so shy
You niggas outta sight acting hard lying on they record
Know it when you see recognize it don't respect it
Got every right to check 'em when you see 'em in your city
Run up on 'em and try 'em but you see that they some bitches
Niggas tell you what they want you to hear
Don't tell me real recognize real eventually they'll see

Like we left the kids at home and just let 'em loose with the crayons
Fuck, I just hit a jogger
People lookin' like frogger
They hoppin' out the way whenever they see Marshal's car comin'
The kids painted my windows with black, permanent marker
And left the rest of the car color cover like swirl pops
And I got the bass thumpin' but I'm bound to bump into something
Kids are flyin' through the air lookin' like they're crumpin', the way they're tumbling
I gotta do something
But soon as I hit the carwash, to get the tar off
Then it's right back at it tomorrow
They're like dad, this is in, so get with the trend
This is for the pimps, listenin' to MIMS, nail polish on the rims
And now it's custom chrome, but I gotta go do a show

Its ironic kind of shit that we buy man
Make us psychotic
Threat to corporate America, then why they runnin' from me
How could they be so ignorant look at what hip hop den done
Its allowed us to run a business, we should of made it our money
Got us out the ghettos, relocated our mommies
I made it all the way here, ain't no way you takin' it from me
So excuse me Oprah honey I'm sorry really I promise
But niggas bitches and hoes do exist I'm just bein' honest
But why am I bein' punished why is you so astonished
Now I ain't got a degree just intelligence and abundance
So you ain't gotta like me I know millions folks that love me

You swear these niggas is dangerous the gangsta shit they sayin'
Lock 'em up in the booth with a half a ounce of that cannabis
Sittin' back and watch the outlandish shit they betrayin' (but)
Soon as you see em they freeze up like in museums
Them statues you like is that the dude who said he was gonna pop
Niggas get runnin' before you finish your sentence
And then they back to riffin' when they off in a safe distance
You like you was just here you disappeared like magicians in thin air
I'm like damn nigga at least keep it consistent
I hear you debatin' me lately, I've been doin' my best to stay hater-free
Still watch what you say to me
Sooner or later I'll take you up on your offer 
And put you all in your place like I'm replacing your father
You talkin' to the author, the architect of the blueprint
My DNA in your music mothafucker are you stupid?

'Cause I ain't never been a sucka been gangsta my whole life
So a nigga disrespect me and it's on on sight
I hear what you say in your songs some of it I don't like
Heat it up I feel tried I see you we gon' fight
Be a man say my name if you talkin' to me
You never said well I figured you ain't talkin' to me
Find out you is at the awards well I'll call you out in the street
I swear I'll beat your fuckin' ass like it ought to be beat!
See all that whisperin' is lame I ain't one for the game
If I say fuck you nigga fuck you simple and plain
I say no problem it no problem pimp you do the same
You can just swallow your pride 'cause you know I'm off the chain
Try to refrain from bein' violent but you come out your face
I got my lawyer paid up ready to catch me a case
When I feel you disrespected me I'm a get me a case

Matter fact I don't even remember falling asleep

Atlantic office claimin' J just keep calling the heat
Is it an emergency or something you need to talk to me?

J said, ""I thought you needed to talk to me
If it's a change made aware I think I outta be
You making ultimatums now you don't talk to me
You make shit way worse then it outta be""
I ain't arguin' on the phone, come talk to me

You were workin' on the album, I was listenin' now

Then Doug called, ""Ay you spoke to J?""
Yeah, is it something I don't know that I was supposed to say?
All I know before the hour I awoke today
Nigga commin' wit' the realist and he chose today

I'm real close to J, I seen ups and downs hit
But I ain't never heard him sound the way that he sounded
Really caught a nigga by surprise, I was astounded
He a real cool dude but why he call me clownin'?

You say'n you don't know bout it? Know bout what?

Makin' death threats, talkin' loud, gettin' buck

Say you waitin' out your deal till you hear it's up
Planin' to make away with 20 million bucks
You bullshitin' me, right? Is you serious brugh?
Yeah, they said you found out the rapper T.I.P wit' us

I talked to Craig, Jewels and Kais a long time
Long story short they said you don lost ya damn mind
And I runnin' off deep and across ya damn mind
You crossed the thin line, I'm hearin' 'em tell Atlantic

It's so much shit about cha, they don't give a shit about cha
Say'n you ain't doin' nothing they couldn't have done without cha

Flip another 7 grams oh you hustlin' now
Time to get yourself a half, make sure it's some glass
A hundred bags, sell it fast, stack o' G's
Now you officially...

[Chorus]

I bet you think you're pretty good at it now huh?

Now once you've flipped a couple o's now the game gets gravy
Take 1250 go get two and a baby
That's 63 grams if you whip that right
You should get back 5 or 6 that night
Stack that money and repeat that twice
Buy you somethin' to ride in, you know it gotta be tight
Next time you buy somethin', take twenty-five hundred
Get 4 and a half it come back in nine dont it?
Now stay low key when the money keep comin'
Keep some n****s on your team, show them suckas they don't want it
By then your connect will clearly see you on the grind
S*** you come and get a nine and he front you what you buyin'
As long as you bring back your money on time
And if you snort blow you do it on your own time
At this rate you'll be at a brick in no time
They say they want some weight tell the n**** stand in line

[Chorus]

Stay with me now shorty, here come the fun part...

Now the robbers plottin on ya, and your name stay buzzin
You caught a sale case down in Macon with your cousin
Your connect ain't worried, you and him cool
You know you'll never tell what you and him do
A mob of a hundred just a few of them true
You heard a worker snitchin' on you, and it's true
Everybody know you sell that s***
The feds come and get ya and they tell you s***
We heard you...

Tote that tool, make that double
Better be cool you don't want no trouble
Can we lean it to the left, but gas they car
I'm always superclean when you see me on the block
Keep the money in a knot with a rubberband on it
Blow that marijuana you know I got it if you want it
You see me standin' on the corner, slangin' that crack
You know how it is to be the man in the trap
(I show you how to be a)

'Cause it ain't watcha do
The question is who saw

'Catch me any day you want
You can think I'm a play if you want
But the facts that remain
If I got an AK and you don't
Well then playa you gone
Don't get me wrong
P**** n****s wanna kill me too (where they at)
But this ain't 'bout s***
Cause its very well known where I'm at

Boy you might talk loud act real
But they don't really want this here
P**** n***** better act right lay low
We know where yo family live
Trust me you don't want me up in yo grill
Wit a ski mask on duct taping your kids
You can pray all you want
But I don't forgive
You should have been doin' nothing
But what you do with your dick
I ain't gotta spell it out pimpin you know what it is
The rest gangsta on the real man you know what it is
Plus I got a hundred goons wit me
Dressed in black
Fifty at the front door, fifty at the back
Half got gauges, half got mags
Bring 'em out bring 'em out
Show 'em where they at
We can do them right here
We can catch them in a trap

Run up on this n****
Put a hole in his hat
Put his brains on the dash in the stalks
He has some dumb fifty more with him
Tell them to hold that
Lights out no hasta manana hasta la vista sara nara y tu
No tomorrow no remorse no sorrow
And the next one of y'all n***** try me like that
I swear to God man
I'm really gonna snap

[Chorus]

Way now over there
I'm a now how to make a n**** beg please
When a bullet goes by
Probably feel a little breeze
Drop to yo knees
I can see the big barrel of the chrome flip
Double grip ain't no where to squeeze
I keep a couple lit off for the n***** who talk s***
When I go to Jacob and I cop that brain
If he tried to see me
I'm a cop that thing
And I'm pop that thing
And the shots gonna stay
The n**** bout to set the trunk wit me
For the most part n**** your stuck with me
I'd tell you something if you was really smart
And you knew better
People probably tell ya
Don't f*** with me
Front if you want mothaf*****
You can catch it
The smile on my face
Even if I got a ratchet
Aah Pop off police pull me over
Believe I got a compartment
And now gotta stash it
Must I just remind ya n*****
When I come through
Know that I am a fine ya n*****
Take two break through
Bust so many shots
Come now I'll probably blind y'all n*****
Now OK
Lets go see you don't really want to feel a mobs search blow
Clap up a n**** then I cap up a n****
When I finish this s*** we'll turn it into an obsearch yo
Look, Listen, then you better observe yo,
Listen to the sizzle from the bullet that the glock burst fro (sss)
Should a probably tweaked you up just a little
And had your body leanin, lookin' like a quarter past four
Stay down better, (stay down) checkin' for a n**** who can put yo body in the dirt (ooh)

You know I got it under way, Sir

[Chorus]",Hurt
T.I.,"You gotta get your swagger together, nigga, get your suitcase
Starts on the inside, ya dig, I don't need mine, I got cribs where we goin?
If you don't love yourself you can't love nobody
Keep up, nigga, I love myself, you gon' need to travel, ladies
You go and get that Mack diesel, right

I'm the man from Atlanta to way out in Cali
Catch me in New York, I'm on the way to Miami
I be in Hawaii then catch me in Paris
I be at home barely, I'll sleep when I'm buried

What I need some sleep for? This dope got me geeked up
I went to Japan and made a mil' in a week, bro
These niggaz can't keep up when they see me in London
So I go out in Ibiza, that time I ain't sleep for

?Bout three days, maybe you'll see me in Haiti
With Wyclef Jean and a selection of ladies
But my folk got that workin? like they back in the eighties
See the money's what move me, conversation don't phase me

Tell 'em why ?cause I been around the world
Traveled the seven seas and I be
Poppin? bottles with celebrities so you can find me
Flyin? high, smokin? better trees

Girls around the world
They keep callin? me, they call me
Paparazzi, they be follow me, they all be
Hopin? that they get a shot of me

It's my swag, they wonder what's so special 'bout him?
Why they ain't sellin? records like him? Tell 'em
It's my swag, how he always look so cool?
And why everybody do what he do, so

Gotta be my swag, they wonder why he wear his hat like that?
When girls see him why they act like that? Aye, I don't know
It's my swag, for some reason all the real niggaz love him
Even though their girlfriend wanna fuck him
I guess, gotta be my swag

Gettin? money in Frisco, wearin? my raincoat
See I'm gettin? wet and this bitch in the same boat
I came in the game slow, they act like they ain't know
That I wasn't gon' leave until I got what I came fo'

I still can't complain? though as long as I ain't broke
I came a long way but, shawty, ain't nothin? changed though
I still let the tool go, don't get it confused, bro
Run up on me wrong, now what you think I'ma do, bro?

Send you to your maker then go to Jamaica
Or either to Cabo, I chill at my condo
My swagger is perfect, hatin? on me ain't worth it
Guarantee you, boy, the Earth my turf if that hurts

Tell 'em why ?cause I been around the world
Traveled the seven seas and I be
Poppin? bottles with celebrities so you can find me
Flyin? high, smokin? better trees

Girls around the world

Regardless what haters say I'm as real as they come
I'm chasin? that paper, baby, however it come
I'm singin? a song and movin? yay by the ton
You never seen a nigga gettin? money so young

How I get from the pen all the way to Berlin
I've been to Switzerland, skiing and pimpin?, goin? again
It ain't nothin? to catch me in the south of France
In a coffee shop smokin? dro in Amsterdam

It ain't nothin? to fly all the way to Dubai
St. Barts, St. Lucia, any day we can try
G-5 to Moscow and they say I'ma lie
I'ma ball like a dog 'til the day that I die

Tell 'em why ?cause I been around the world
Traveled the seven seas and I be
Poppin? bottles with celebrities so you can find me

This is impeccable pimpin?
You couldn't duplicate this shit if I told you how to, man
Ha, y'all, niggaz, keep up
By the time you get to Puerto Rico, my nigga, I'll be in Cuba

By the time you get to Cuba I'll be in Haiti
By the time you get to Haiti I'll be way over in Africa, man

T.I.,"Lets go...
Y'all gon' wish for a n**** like me
When I ain't here you know what I'm sayin'

(You don't appreciate a n**** my type
Once I die there ain't no more n***** my type
So just remember me right)

[Chorus:]
Bet you don't appreciate a n**** my type
But when I die there ain't no more n***** my type
So just remember me right
Bet if I let them suckers kill me tonight
All them haters gon' be filled with delight
God forgive me aight
I sacrifice so they can live my life
If necessary I'll give my life
What you hear is my life
Reputation decorated with stripes
No need crying at the end of my life
Just remember me right

When your back was against the wall remember where could you go
Remember who helped you again like he helped you before
Went out the way to let you know that you ain't never alone
They disrespect you come here until they left you alone
He taught you how to be weak, he taught you how to be strong
Taught you not to accept defeat you go all out or be gone
But it ain't the same in the streets now that he gone
He now in heaven on the throne exactly where he belong
But he left millions devastated and his family mourned
Sons turn to grown man since their daddy been gone
Daughters grew like him or not he left his family home
Even prepared the funeral service he had in the dome
And then they came to represent for a stand up gent
Who walked it like he talked it, always said what he meant
Impossible to stop him had a head like cement
Maybe now you'll appreciate the n**** like this...

[Chorus]

If they only knew the man outside of the hype
No matter what the situation he alway try to do right
Still they gossip and told lies, used to take him for granted
Often found it hard to relate, some how they can't understand it
'Cause that respect he gon' demand it, theres a problem he handle it
Looked adversity in the eye, he never ran from a challenge
They try to knock him off balance when the fed came and got him
Did the time on the edge came home now he ain't stoppin'
Now while them n****s used to hate him, but they girl use to jock him
Swear he had the kinda swagger made the world stop and watch him
Plus he possessed so much hustle, made it impossible to top him
Got better every album, haters hate to see him drop em'
They just talk s*** from a distance, when he around they playin' posse
He use to scare the suckers s***less, probably why them n***** shot him
Hey what it took nothing else than what they could've ever did about him
So go on talk s*** about him
At least you ain't forgot about him...

[Chorus]

Wanna say sorry to my mama
King and lil' mama
See me go through so much drama
You could stand a little thunder
Never let em' see you sweat, stay cool as a cucumber
Stay ready for whatever, make note I'm a do wonder
How he died? On his feet like a man with honor
Showed you the sky was the limit, you can do whatever you wanna
Death above the money, deja need me
Don't worry bout me Uncle Phil the ladies with me
See me with your granddaddy
I know you gon' miss daddy
But life ain't always a dream, and horrible s*** happens
Had I let a n**** kill me before I could quit rapping
And get to spend more time with ya, I know we would a been happy
But I had to take the chances, You would have been trappin'
Long as I could keep that from happening
Ya papi could die happy
So keep the wind at your back and the sun at your face
Remember winnin' in your blood you were born with what it take (OK)...

Hook a hustle up wit investors and there he go again
20 million later and I'm guessin' it's finally soakin' in
At best you just a hater who mad at me 'cause he broke again
Sellin' all ya jewelry, considerin' sellin' dope again
'Cause he who's ballin' outta control is suppose to be focusin'
Wanna be the king by default, they hopin' for openings
Pray they see the day they hear me say I'll never flow again

Is you crazy pull your gun in the club
See how many folks and polices put you down in the club
If we got to come with a slug why we come to the club
How much more of this s*** you think we can put under the rug
Look we already told them I Told You So,
But all these n***** speaking out whoever spoke before
Don't take it personal people want to be close to folk
What you think the television and the posters for?
(I'm claustrophobic though)
Well then you need to see a doctor for it
Man I ain't joking you close T.I.P. and bout to blow it
Did you forget about them nights in the cells was you honesty
When we was having talks with God and you promise
If he could make away for you to be large and you done it
Out the gate Urban Legend went on to do numbers
Sold a mill made ATL king first week
Five hundred with the Grammy (but not the one that I wanted)
What about them eight figure deals and that other new money
But ask yourself something where the
Gun you got from me?
Keep it real...

You need to think of someone other than yourself some time, did you keep your promise
Keep it real

They probably try to come in the hood and sell weed
Think it's all good until they run into some real g's
Holler tell us where it is
And I promise well leave
Hesitate to sayin' boy them llama well squeeze
Please pay attention to this part of the bull
One time got robbed got shot got shook
Got a job started rhymin' came up with a hook
Got a chain and some tats came up with a look
Went and made it here
Workin' talk tough in a bull
F*** the image and perception they never tough as they look
They some mothaf****** suckers
Put it on wherever
Any real n**** no better man these n*****

[Chorus]

Ya can't tell
Them n***** ain't surely
Get caught with a n**** gon' tell
Them n**** don't sell
This ya G ain't gotta put it on a scale
He ask you if it weigh enough just tell 'em yeah
Ya n**** just yell
Pull the pistol them n**** gon' bail
If he got a pistol bet he don't spray it
They don't wanna go to jail
And they ain't no hell be walkin' on shells
Gladiator school is you prepared
I can see these n****s scared
Gotta problem wit me n**** just say it
We can play it how you want to play it
Better go ahead
40 pistols will be aimed at yo head
All the way down and where yo gold leg
Jean really on the edge
Jean ain't under suspicion of the feds
You just tellin' them you is as instead
Ya never bought us head
What ya get behind the mic and just said
The people already know I must say it!

[Chorus]

You damn right
These n****s don't have rights
To rap about the s*** I did every night
Did u win every fight
You ever went to jail for sellin' white
May barbick and trap same night
You know these n***** light right

N**** died I survived by the nerve my strife
Went to jail came home
Twenty times got it right
But still tryin' keep for shootin' sucker n***** I don't like
'Cause the game feel like the real n***** on strike

Got every right to check 'em when you see 'em in your city
Run up on em and try 'em bet you see that they some b******

Welcome to the Midwest, yes
Where the Detroit players, ball like you have no idea
The boy is here
Got the whole place lookin' like its candy painted, ain't it
Like we left the kids at home and just let 'em loose with the crayons
F***, I just hit a jogger
People lookin' like frogger
They hoppin' out the way whenever they see Marshal's car comin'
The kids painted my windows with black, permanent marker
And left the rest of the car color cover like swirl pops
And I got the bass thumpin' but I'm bound to bump into something
Kids are flyin' through the air lookin' like they're crumpin', the way they're tumbling
I gotta do something
But soon as I hit the carwash, to get the tar off
Then it's right back at it tomorrow
They're like dad, this is in, so get with the trend
This is for the pimps, listenin' to MIMS, nail polish on the rims
And now it's custom chrome, but I gotta go do a show
So go on with your bad self, just have it back to normal when I

From my arrival, to my departure
I guarantee I put this d-i-c-k in somebody daughter, ey
I still have my way with the ladies across the water
Flew from Paris to Haiti, just some s*** that I thought of
Its ironic kind of s*** that we buy man
Make us psychotic
Threat to corporate America, then why they runnin' from me
How could they be so ignorant look at what hip hop den done
Its allowed us to run a business, we should of made it our money
Got us out the ghettos, relocated our mommies
I made it all the way here, ain't no way you takin' it from me
So excuse me Oprah honey I'm sorry really I promise
But n***** b****** and hoes do exist I'm just bein' honest
But why am I bein' punished why is you so astonished
Now I ain't got a degree just intelligence and abundance
So you ain't gotta like me I know millions folks that love me

Sittin' back and watch the outlandish s*** they betrayin' (but)
Soon as you see em they freeze up like in museums
Them statues you like is that the dude who said he was gonna pop
N***** get runnin' before you finish your sentence
And then they back to riffin' when they off in a safe distance
You like u was just here you disappeared like magicians in thin air
I'm like damn n**** at least keep it consistent
I hear you debatin' me lately, I've been doin' my best to stay hater-free
Still watch what you say to me
Sooner or later I'll take you up on your offer and put you all in your place like I'm replacing your father

You never said well I figured you ain't talkin' to me
Find out you is at the awards well I'll call you out in the street
I swear I'll beat your f***in' a** like it ought to be beat!
See all that whisperin' is lame I ain't one for the game
If I say f*** you n**** f*** you simple and plain
I say no problem it no problem pimp you do the same
You can just swallow your pride 'cause you know I'm off the chain
Try to refrain from bein' violent but you come out your face

With two revolvers in my pocket pitchin' handling rocks

I am the number one customer at my own car lot
You want to know how much money I'm makin' just imagine a lot (10-20)
I'm probably making more than you'd imagine I got (30-40)

T.I.,"It?s Okay
Tomorrow?ll be a better day

When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight
But the only way to get it is to slang that weight
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

We all Came in the world with a sparkle in our eye
Not knowing the only thing that we can promise is to die
A promise is a lot can?t nobody guarantee it
And death around the corner can?t nobody damn see it
I can?t agree that God good at all time
But we all know shit ain't all good at all time
So I tote my strap in the hood and all time
But respect ain't just something that?s understood in our time
Especially by our kind man I hate it for the future
Police don?t wanna lock ya up no more they wanna shoot ya
And that's half as bad as these hatas?ll do ya
As soon as ya get ya loot up they wanna shoot up
Lord forbid to kill me I bet ya nobody knew what
Suckas get shot and police come straight to us
And that jus how they do us ever since niggas blew up
I know ya goin through it know I?m goin through it too bruh

When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight
But the only way to get it is to slang that weight
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

When ya daughter like 6 and her pops ain't shit
You ain't wanna tell her you and momma gotta go strip
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

I?m doin this for the hood and the kid wit no dad
I was just like ya?ll don?t feel so bad
Know it?s hard when ya live so bad
They whoop ya ass and they wonder why ya still so bad
For long, ya get whoopin?s and just laugh
Momma washin? clothes and find a lil? blue bag
She ask what ya what ya doin ya tell her stuntin? like my daddy
You knew that I was gonna be a hustla when ya had me
Look around ma you sent me to the store to get some bread
And I?m passin? atleast 8 J?s or mo?
Rent been late for 8 days or mo?
But slangin? blow a better habit than 8 days of snow

Ya out speedin' wit the white and ya see the blue lights
And ya on ya 3rd strike so the judge say life
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

If ya son 14 and his dad a folk criminal
Hard to realize it Baby girl but god with ya
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

My momma girl son 14 just got killed
Had to catch myself
Bout to tell her I know how ya feel
I?d a been a damn liar
See her tryin not to cry
She know he in a better place
But she just wanna know why
Know somebody touch mine
And a nigga gon? die
It?s goin down
How dare I tell her to calm down
I tried to convince her that he in God?s arms now
She said I don?t believe that there's a God right now
I know its hard right now and ya heart light now
But God give new begginins you can start right now
Know ya scarred right now 'cause you apart right now
But Shit you in better shape than we are right now

When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight
But the only way to get it is to slang that weight

Put up the house and bet the odds if coming from me

Other open cases

Everybody right here,
What you need to do is be thankful
For the life you got, you know what I'm sayin?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got
And start being thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em baby girl

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are
So live your life (Hey! Ay ay ay)
You steady chasin' that paper, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
Ain't got no time for no haters, just live your life

My life (Ay) my life (Oh) just livin' my life

Hey, never mind what haters say
Ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazin' they ungrateful
After all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way
For you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away
Now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege
Homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious
They violate in a major way
I never been a hater
Still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay'
You know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white
It has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway
Even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way
Not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood
And all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience
But they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray
Now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life
Can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are

I'm the opposite of moderate
Immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler
And the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit
Impartial to the politics
Articulate
But still'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems
With their record sales just holler TIP
If that don't work and all else fails
Then turn around and follow TIP
I got love for the game
But ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame
And rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin'
Back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know
What you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight
Of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account
And you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches
'Cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far

Got everybody watchin' what I do
Come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' away
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (Shinin')
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life
I will never lose

Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it,
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical,
Last thing I'm worried 'bout is what another rapper do,
Ain't nobody hot as me
Even if they rap they ass off
Blast off and have outstanding quality,
Sell a lot of records I respect and salute that,
But spitting real life on hot beats I'm the truth at

Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad

Still hit the door and make it rain with the loose change
I'll bet that's what he get a show, now that's a damn shame
I guess that's what he hating for, boy you so damn lame (sucka' nigga)
Ya click the same a dusted bunch a walking shit stain
Disgrace the A you give the city such a bad name
You way back in my rear view mirror, I'm in the fast lane
Still I hear ya loud and clear on ya lil' song
Go on get ya dissing on while the King gone
Ya self esteem gone, cause I'm back now
Lets see if we can't teach these niggas how to act now
Ya kissing ass then
Ya jumping back now
I check ya ass then
I shut ya ass down
And I deliver front and center never back down
Who get the last laugh now sucker nigga?

I got a front street swag and a side street hustle
Center Hill Cedar Ave. that's where I be sucker
South Grand church street the first with the work
But we could get into commercial if ya need somethin' chirp me
Hey what I care about who you asking saying they ain't heard of me
I'm certified certainly them videos ain't hurtin' me
I still ride with the window rolled down 
All around the A town like it's finna' go down
If it was every any questions niggas finna' know now
Won't retire my thrown or surrender no crown
I never bow down, and never say doubt
To whom it may concern and whom so ever may try
I'm forever west side and the featherweight dies
Tell 'em take ya best shot goin' get yourself hot
Cause I yelled ""Bankhead"" and you felt left out
I ain't mention yo name that's what all this bout

[Chorus]

From Summerhill to the hills up in Hollywood
A house full getting to it you know how we do it
Where we smoke great, and we drink good
Then we ball hard, just like G's should
Buy what we want, drive what we want
G4 up, up and away we go we fly where we want
Haters smile like they like it when they really don't
Wish they could just wish me away that's what they really want.
""I really hate his ass (I hate 'em) I don't like him neither (me neither)""
""We'll do a song together maybe then we could beat him""
""Somehow he must be stopped, something must be done""
""If we can't knock him off lets just try him when he get caught with guns""
""Then he'll be really done, and we really won""
""Any more ideas? (I got some) Suggestions anyone?""
""How about we stay up all night? (I like that) On the blog site""
""Spread vicious lies and nasty rumors we could all write""
But that's all right
Let the nerds hate
Cause in my face though, the words get ate
And hatin's hard work
When I just bounce back
This god's work tell all the haters I'm back

Hundred stacks on that nigga I'm just, better
Somebody better tell 'em man
They swag owe my swag everything
Very plain to see you study me awful hard
To the point that my swag need a bodyguard
I'd like to think to thank you cause uh y'all oughta be

Every chance I get, real talk, no shit

Ain't another nigga colder, cribs all over
Flash-in-pan, these other rappers catch a number, Coca-Cola
I'm exceeding expectations, you barely meeting quota
I give it to 'em straight, you cut it with baking soda
You said I ain't Zone One, nigga ha, that's a funny one
I'm King like my three year-old, Major like my youngest son
Got one named Domani, so you know what I'm getting (guap)
Deyjah and Neek-Neek and Messiah like ""Daddy, get 'em""
Got an angel named Leah here to keep me outta prison
And my partner Jason Geter to help me see about a billion
Listen, Grand Hustle, best respect this vision
My records sell about a million, but shit that just the beginning
What with Club Crucial and Grand Hustle film division
Multiplication to get the paper, I let the clique do the division
Break bread, StreetCred dot com making a killing
Plus ""A King of Oneself,"" high fashion, I'm flashing
I'm, ready for whatever though, trained to go you better know
Put dick up in whoever hoe, let 'em know

Every chance I get, big money on this
I'll take yo' broad, I can fuck yo' bitch
Know that I'm goin' ball every chance I get, every chance I get

I gotta thank my lucky stars cause it came so far
Dope game, rap game, 'bout the same so far
Brag about your lil' Benz, nigga that ain't no car
I got some shit in my garage that requires a chauffeur
High as gas is, the country at war and people are starving
And I pay a million dollars for Ferrari's, retarded, huh?
Sorry bruh, been a dick that been balling since it started up
Season hoe, get 'em all to fuck cause they know this dough stack tall as fuck
Nah, it ain't that I'm rich that they hate so much
Least I could do it, not rub it in niggas face so much
So I'm trying now while I'm rhyming not to brag about the island
Or the crib in Hawaii where all the walls slide in
House is wide open, we could bring the outside in
I think you should hear about it, but fuck it I'll be quiet
I just spit it how I live it homie I don't be lyin'
Would it make you feel better if I put my pockets on the die?
If I made less money, started to dress bummy
Would the haters and the critics have more respect for me?
Should I downgrade the crib and the way I live?
Naw how about I don't and we just say I did, nigga

Hey I'm so raw, and I'm so rich
And you so flawed niggas ain't 'bout shit
I'll take yo' broad, I can fuck yo' bitch
Know that I'm goin' ball every chance I get
Every chance I get, real talk, no shit
Every chance I get, big money on this
I'll take yo' broad, I can fuck yo' bitch
Know that I'm goin' ball every chance I get, every chance I get

Hey say homeboy
It's real talk coming at you live and direct homeboy, you dig that?
Heh, you could hate all you want partner
I'm a give you something to hate on, bitch nigga
Ha ha! Grand Hustle, you understand?
DJ Toomp you did yo' motherfucking thing as usual
Hey, hey look, P-S-C partner, Pimp Squad Click
Ay, Big Kuntry you up next homie
It's the king, bitch!
Yeah, they say I ain't Zone One, bitch nigga
My grand-mama been living on Center Hill forty three years, hoe-ass nigga
You understand that? Nigga come meet me nigga
See me nigga! You know?
Why niggas gotta wait 'til a nigga got the police watching you
And start kickin' that fuck shit, you know?
You know how I get down, you know what it was nigga
You know you don't wanna see me, bitch nigga!
Yeah!

Hey

Hey I'm so raw, and I'm so rich
And you so flawed niggas ain't 'bout shit
I'll take yo' broad, I can fuck yo' bitch
Know that I'm goin' ball every chance I get
Every chance I get, real talk, no shit
Every chance I get, big money on this
I'll take yo' broad, I can fuck yo' bitch
Know that I'm goin' ball every chance I get, every chance I get",Every Chance I Get
T.I.,"Rappin' for the hell of it
Hella rich never have to sell a brick again
Must I tell a bitch again
The bullshit I'm addressing check I'm on some next level shit
Never been fucked in the game I'm celibate
Rarely out my element, barely out the ghetto with
One foot out and foot in intelligent as fellas get
Listen let's settle this, be clear I could fall back seven years
And still ain't no one ahead of me

Consider it a blessin' if you get to stand next to me
Five star general O.G. veteran
Caked like Edimen blowing that celery
Stack that cash like the U.S. treasury
Every single thing I ever did was done heavily
Rap until your seventy still ain't catching me
Put it on my pops, big Phil and Beverly
Be standing on the top still after they bury me
Nose in the air so stuck up arrogant
Ain't got long hot songs best cherish it
Whoever drop mine that's over phenito
You paying for your foul like a free throw (bow)
Now how could a nigga think that he could see me
Other than the magazine covers or the t.v.
You know I sold more mixtapes than your CD
You're waiting on your big break praying you can beat me
You ain't made it far as D-C on the low
I been all around the globe like a god how they treat me
Broads hit they knees eyes closed when they greet me
Mouth wide open just begging me to skeet skeet
You in a deep sleep stop dreaming
I'm six albums in for 10 years I been firin' hot semen
The limelight's mine I'm gleaming beaming
That's why I say I'm King bitch I got my reasons

Wrist so frosty, neck so chilly
All on my mind is to get more millies
Niggas talk shit that's silly
Shawty he ain't about that really, is he
Nigga I'm illy

Hey I run this city clearly
Tell 'em get lost I'm busy really
Nigga I'm illy

Where niggas get off piss off
Me and mine ah to take time to pop a lid off
Shit all over the way bouncing me is y'all
Seeing you fucking mind you figuring I would fizz off
Never cooled off tip scorching
Minimal injury though they missing me maximum misfortune
Number one hands down flow paints portraits
Everybody think you stink like horse shit
House full of chicks on some girl next door shit
A king of one self 30 mill out the store quick
Of course this case lost all my endorsements
Tripled up on real estate still buying more shit
Tip bankrupt according to your sources
I'm still caked up along with more reinforcements
Tore shit up from the ladder to the rooftops
Officially the hottest nigga rapping since Tupac
Before you rap bout me best ask bout me
I'm out my fucking mind need counseling
Please don't doubt me trust me drama ain't nothing
It's all fun and games till somebody start busting
Remember my discussion when rappers be battling
I find out about it better get to skedaddling
Pack your family's bags move 'em out to Seattle an'
You ever crawl back you'll need ambulance and bandages
Live life glamorous so extravagant
Mandarin oriental worldwide traveling
Hip hop champion for real though
You couldn't fuck with me with a Brazil hoe nigga
But still though

Wrist so frosty, neck so chilly
All on my mind is to get more millies
Niggas talk shit that's silly
Shawty he ain't about that really, is he
Nigga I'm illy
Jus' remember I do this shit when I want to nigga
Its me nigga

I run this city clearly
Tell 'em get lost I'm busy really
Nigga I'm illy

Wrist so frosty, neck so chilly
All on my mind is to get more millies
Niggas talk shit that's silly
Shawty he ain't about that really, is he
Nigga I'm illy

I don't wanna hear shit bout I cant rap like this one
Hen I ain't good as that one
Fuck you partna!

I run this city clearly
Tell 'em get lost I'm busy really
Nigga I'm illy

Yeah its the king bitch!",I'm Illy

Drama
Ursher baby

Hey, hey (yeah man)
Hey what's happening everybody
I hope they get my good side
You know I gotta look good when I walk out the house
You know I know the camera's following (me to)
I know they taking pictures, right Drama
Hey man, you watch it I live it, you dig that
Y'all sit back relax get some popcorn man
I'm gonna make it a good show, you dig that
(Are you not entertained?)
This going make a hell of a movie huh

[Chorus]
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
I walk they follow (ay)
I talk they holler (ay)
Just here for your amusement
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
You waiting for me to lose it
I guess I'm just here for your amusement

Ay
The price of fame I think I paid, want my change I done gave
Everything in my possession for my seconds on the stage
For my name up in lights and multi-million record sales
I done gave up my life, can't get a moment to myself
When alone I ask myself, is it worth it? I ain't perfect
Neither is anybody else, but I think my kids deserve
To be with Daddy out in public without all the interruptions
When the lies and gossip's published I'm the topic of discussion
And I stay in trouble just to show these suckers I ain't lost it
And I'd do it all again that's the funny thing about it
I ain't playing, boy I'm 'bout it
Will I change, boy I doubt it
I done been a lot of things, I ain't never been a coward
See the paparazzi crowded all around me now
Same niggas who was dissing want a pound like I'm senile (fuck nigga)
Showered with support from my adoring fans
They hear T.I.'s arrested they're like here we go again

My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
I walk they follow (ay)
I talk they holler (ay)
Just here for your amusement (my life)
My life, your entertainment (entertainment)
You watch it while I live it (live it) (whoa)
You waiting for me to lose it (whoa)
I guess I'm just here for your amusement (yeah)

You've seen it all before, guys know how the story goes
It's like 2Pac never died, sit back, enjoy the show
You see the shit that scares you senseless, I done lived through it
Knew the risks and the consequences and I still do it
And then I'm so fresh, them niggas mildew it
Not just a actor by profession, pimp, I live movies
That's why they whisper when they see me point and stare at me
Cause they just wanna live through me vicariously (vicariously)
Fashion weekend, Paris week, party like a rock star
Get blown by a top model till she catch lockjaw
Got the dough you get a year, stashed in my sock drawer
Showed you the troubles and the struggles of an outlaw
Top dog would not fall, I am not y'all (niggas)
Couple pages out the calendar and I'm out y'all
Kid listen, pay attention, you don't wanna be me
It's safer to watch it on T.V.

My life, your entertainment (entertainment)
You watch it while I live it (live it)
I walk they follow (ay)
I talk they holler (ay)
Just here for your amusement 
My life, your entertainment 
You watch it while I live it (live it) 
You waiting for me to lose it (lose it)
I guess I'm just here for your amusement (yeah)

See I don't think it would even matter (to me)
Working a nine to (five) would it be better
I mean be honest, would you care to gossip about me ('bout me)
Not likely
I guess that's just the way that it goes (the way that it goes)
('Cause I know) See I can be somewhere out keeping it cool
(And get told) Almost anything instead of the truth
Y'all know more than I do, it's breaking news to me too
Easy killer y'all know that ain't how I move (ooh)
He said and she said (what) I did what, with they (who)
No not me I said (not me) she gave me no head (ooh)
Won't get me again (hey) I pleaded the fifth (hey)
I know better than to ever talk during the film
Man them flashing lights can blind your eyesight
To when you can't see what's wrong from right
Well shorty 'til you walk a mile in my shoes
And understand this is who I am

Usher I completely concur
Life would be such a blur, obviously we prefer
Our privacy but instead we endure
Yes sir, don't expect nothing less of me
Cause this going probably be this way until the death of me
But for the hustle and the lady on my arm now
Plus all my kids and my mom's I'm a calm down
And yo, we doing just fine, and the time's just flying
Live one headline at a time
Ya dig

[Chorus]",My Life Your Entertainment
