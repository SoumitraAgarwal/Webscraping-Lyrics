Comeback Kid,"Your debt's escalating
Whisper no regrets
Run your mouth in circles
You're chewing, chewing the flesh

Your talk is cheap and it's going nowhere
Think you're out changing the world
Choking on each word you spit

Those basement dwelling days are so far from me
Moving mountains in your head
Buying into all that's said

Dive, sink, drown
Caught up in this lie
Dive, sink, drown
Caught up in this life outside your own

Your talk is cheap and it's going nowhere
Think you're out changing the world
Choking on each word you spit

Convinced of your false visions
You're the sucker
Keep talking
Keep talking away
Keep talking

Cashing in all your petty words
It's so far from me
Living like you're dead",Talk Is Cheap
Comeback Kid,"So here I go again
We had our chance
Half smile, you look my way
Run now and some might say
We all die alone

And I'll never forget what killed us
She screams to be alone
Going over it in my head
What's left, what's left to say
We all die alone
We all die alone
We all die alone

Can we ever take back the nights
The nights we wasted on another fight
Does this really all end tonight
Does this really all end tonight

This is the rest, this is the 
Rest of our lives alone
Can we ever take back the nights 
Does this really all end tonight? 
Take back our nights
Take back our nights
Take back our nights",The Trouble I Love
Comeback Kid,"This is our city of the dead
Another life owes its dreary head
We all, we try, we live, to lie
Doubting days, trying to get by
Waiting for the calling
Anticipation in the air
We only dream of difference
City's sleeping, unaware
Break the silence, (wake the dead)
Running through these streets alone
I can't get sleep, let's break this hole
'Cause I swear, and this will render useless
I promised you, we got this far
Not gonna stop me, gonna stop me now
I'm not hiding in shadows
Wake up
Saying that this passage is clear

You said, you said, you said
This time was gonna be different
Wake up the dead

You said, you said, you said
This time was gonna be different
Wake up the dead

Drop me the line, something stirs inside
This isn't over yet
Shake off the dirt
Swallow regret
Stop living under the weight
Living under the weight of regret
Your regrets
Don't lose hope
Your regrets
Don't lose hope
Don't let it happen to you
Don't lose hope
Which side are you gonna choose?
'Cause I'm only, I believe in seeing you rise!

We said, we said, we said
This time was gonna be different
Wake up the dead

We said, we said, we said
This time was gonna be different
Wake up the dead

We said, we said, we said
This time was gonna be different
Wake up the dead

We said, we said, we said
This time was gonna be different
Wake up the dead",Wake the Dead

Comeback Kid,"I saw you on the fence
Whistle of the current's getting louder now
Disconnecting
Now is the time
Just barely hanging by your fingertips
Disconnecting

Surrounded by your protected shell
You better get out, cause' I can't do this for you
This strategy's weakening the design
Stalling and dragging your feet way behind

Given the circumstances, I won't let it go
Because I remember when
You were so convincing
Now just procrastinating

One more day, one more night
Keep it up kid you'll never decide
What to say, where to turn, where to go

That is something I can't say for you",Come Around
Comeback Kid,"They had finally come to grips
And the pieces somehow fit
Could it be?
Yet something's lingering
?What is it??

At first she had her eyes down staring at the floor
Uncertain, she lifted them to find the words
Shouting from the wall
Like a devil on her shoulder reading?

In case of fire, leave the area immediately
Avoid it, save yourself from any more grief
In case of fire, leave the area immediately
Avoid it, disappear but please don't jeopardize

?What is it? It's wearing me out asking this!? he said
?I refuse to be left in the dark
I've been ringing out every last drop
Ringing out everything I am
It's out for you
Everything I am
There's no disguise
Would you just trust me this time??

He always swore it was?
Swearing unconditional
And she's ready to call it off

What is it? I'm getting so scared asking this?",In Case of Fire
Comeback Kid,"I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life, tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier then ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I'd loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and make it all right
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time all the time",In/Tuition
Comeback Kid,"There was desire that burned
And when the dust had blown away
There was a whisper of gold
No reservations, they were expecting for some time
There was a whisper of gold

The streets were filled with all it's noise
Swelling up so they set up a decoy
It didn't matter no one had a clue anyway
But they were always second guessing
No room for any error
Positions in check and the plan underway
And impossibly... 

Just barely slipping by
The doors came open just in time
They came back running, on such a high
Open it up lets see what's inside

Those involved gathered around

But they weren't satisfied
Everyone swore that it was all they could find
Those involved gathered around
But they weren't satisfied
No one left satisfied

Eyes shift, pulse fit
Failure right down the throat
Someone here must be holding out
Retracing their steps
Everyone in the room grilling the next
This will surely cost us problems
Settle it up lets see what's left to divide

Still craving not yet satisfied
What will it take?
How long will this take?
Still craving not yet satisfied. Still hungry.",One Left Satisfied

Comeback Kid,"Beyond our love is the truth and it comes between us
Beyond our love is the proof and it passes through us
Until the wool has been pulled from our eyes
I can't acknowledge if I keep denying
Until the moment when we realize
Process all this, going in blind

All day long forcing me to come to terms with reality
All along forcing me to find my peace with insanity
Life's got a funny way of showing
The hardest part is knowing when to give up. When to go
Life's got a funny way of showing
Now you have to choose between your heart and what you know
Uncertain, unsettled
I was too involved, I was too close.",Beyond
Comeback Kid,"I felt the pressure building up 
Pushing from every side
You didn't even mind
It took the rest of me to stop and say no more
You didn't even mind

Am I just reading it all wrong?
Too many voices overtaking and I'm misplacing
Wasting this precious time, avoiding signs
I'm in too deep to quit
And there's just too many good reasons that keep me sucked in
Though barely scraping by, you didn't flinch at all 
I spent the rest of my earnings on just feeling numb
I never meant to keep putting this on you
It's all wrong, It's alright

When it's all gone bad
And I've probably lost it
The world could die, but you'd survive

How many faced with
How many torn
I see how much I wasted
While you never turned.",Didn't Even Mind
Comeback Kid,"I was searching the streets where we lost our stride
Making our way through the earth
My heart was marching to a different beat
While my choices were making it harder to find 

You took the straight and narrow
Prying eyes watching from overhead
I took the other
Down, but recovered 
And I would do it all over and over again

Disappointment, dedication
Elevated catastrophe

Die knowing that you lived to find 
Die knowing where your friendships lie 
Die knowing you gave nothing less 
Die knowing it was imminent
Die knowing what your failures find
Die knowing where your friendships lie 
Die knowing you gave nothing less 
Die knowing it was imminent.",Die Knowing
Comeback Kid,"Built to land hard
That's exactly where we left it
Slippery downslide
And you could never fake it
I apologize, so excuse me
Slow we pacify
Come in full swing

Silence
Maybe it'll seem like it's gone
Vacant
Knowing what you want when you can't
Balance
I could never stress it enough
Of all the right choices
I start with the wrong ones

Still falling, reckless and on again
Rumor mills got me locked in
Killing time, just hope it doesn't kill me
What is free? 
What is free when you won't stop watching me?

Everything I do is adding up  
Now I'm taking the warning
Everywhere I go…
I can't avoid it, but I can control it
Everything I do… I can't avoid it
Everywhere I go… 
I can't avoid it, but I can control it.",Full Swing
Comeback Kid,"We repeat it
Repeat. Our habits form

I don't know if you can see
I'll shed a bit of honesty
This feeling, never had before
Repeating and the habits form

Such an ominous mystery
Crave that certain serenity
We repeat it

Sober even, patterns form 
Giving less, expecting more
Something you can't recreate
Something I cannot debate

Such an ominous mystery
Crave that certain serenity

I depend, I depend, I control!","I Depend, I Control"
Comeback Kid,"You told me once, back at it again
Always the same with it, I can't stop you
Well maybe it's true for you, but I'm not seeing it
You wanna live with it, but I've got no room

Well maybe it's true for you, and I won't stop you
Give me some space to breathe, 'cause I've got no room
Well maybe it's true for you, and I can't stop you
Give me some space to breathe, 'cause I can't rest here with you

I've gotta be reasonable
But it's all become too predictable 
I'm letting it ride, but I'm not losing sleep
This future is not up to you

Rise up for the innocent
Tried it on but it didn't fit
Guard down, there's a subtle flame
Subtle moment to have your say
Lining up opposite of me 
What a moment of clarity
A shining moment to say… 
For what? I know, so what!
I'm not about it, you can have it

I've gotta be reasonable
But it's all become too predictable

Comeback Kid,"Stormy summer day is in the way
Of all the could've beens and should've beens
How do you anticipate
This distorted tragedy 
Things like this don't just go away
Things like this tear your family
And I admit I can't relate 
Believe me I won't walk away  

'Cause when the circumstance holds you back
Lower the line

Your broken vessel
When you paint that picture
When you're all shook up

'Cause you know it won't die in your sleep
You finally said it out loud

Stormy summer day is in the way
Of all the could've beens and should've beens

Comeback Kid,"Adamant, adamant. Tunnel vision view
Wasn't gonna pull the plug, had to see it through
What a bright idea that wouldn't quit

I've only made things worse today 
And everyone, everything's in my way

Are you happy, are you happy now?
Can I tip the scale? 
Well maybe I'm just bound to fail

I've seen versions of you

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

Send back my love

Down in the corner was this real sharp cat
Had a 300 dollar platform shoes and a 100 dollar cowboy hat
He was standing on the curb by a fancy Buick down the floor
And this voice from inside says ""Come on sugar, let's go""

It should've been me with that real fine chick
It should've been me with that real fine chick
By now you know who that should have been
Driving that Dynaflow

I hate to get heavy but listen to this

I ate some fish 'n' chips, I felt okay
I passed by a fancy cafe
I saw a man eating one of them T-bone stakes
He hollered, gracious stand by the side feeling him, Lordy

Still hears my broken song of love

Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.

Wasn't May the month we started?
To stick around for magnet compatibility
I'll offer up my cue, it's been too long my dear
This sickening dance
I've got the calluses to prove to you that I've been bruising too

This is it, we can't get back what went away
Locked to our hopes for something new
That's all you get
A shining image of yourself flawed by mistakes you never made
There's nothing left but a few words when passing by
You can't admit that there's nothing to say

I wish you were more than just a hobby to me
(We could stop or move on, a month or two to be together)
And when you let me go you led me into...
(Why can't I want more than just...)
Your warping vision of the way we'll be once we get so lonely

This is it, a final plea for leniency
Can't wait around for something new
That's all you get
A buried memory of me locked on our slow and tired dance
There's nothing left
Twelve frozen months did melt away
Is this how it had to be

I'd say I do, I wish you'd say
I'd say I do, I wish you'd say it too

I am an honest man I need the love of you
I am a working man

The fifty years of sweat and tears
That never left a trace

Beneath a darker sky

And I'm without you once again
You laughed at me, you said you've never needed me
I wonder if you need me now
We played the games that people play
We made mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me
Remembering the pain, if I must say
It's deep in my mind and locked away
But then most of all, I do love you
Still

Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget
Those feelings we can't put aside
For what we had, sometimes I try to understand
But it's so heavy on my mind
So many dreams that flew away, so many words we didn't say
Two people lost in a storm, where did we go, where'd we go?
Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down
But then most of all, I do love you
Still

We played the games that people play
We made our mistakes along the way

We were too blind to see, but then

So I take time
Out my day
To pray and I say
Now I lay me down to sleep
Hopin' that I keep
My soul
Peep, I'm gettin' old
And it's a cold cold world
And I ain't even got a bomber
Livin' with my momma
It's the same routine
Keep my room clean
I'm lookin' to do some new things but ain't shit to do
I'm twenty-two, catch
In the prime of my life
I have no time for a wife
I funnel through the tunnel
Disgruntled, tryin' to find me some light
In the rim of darkness
Alright you sing, I may not be the darkest
Brother
But I was always told to act my age and not my color
Knowin' that my color was that of the original
So now I sing the new negro spiritual
It goes get up stand up,
It's like how can you understand the pain
When you never had to stand under the rain
When it rains it pours, and it's about to come down hard
Thank God I found you
As I walk down the road of existence
I get resistance
From all angles
I tangle
For cash
Hopin' it'll last
Til the end of the week
But all I eat is fast food
And you know how junk food goes right through ya
So I return to the arab
And on the way back
I stop and the liquor store
Grab me a six pack
Knowin' that once I'm done with that I'll be back
To get some more
Once I get started I don't want to stop
And I can't turn around
Brew, I can't turn it down
Ironically I turn it up
My liver I burn it up (Fat line)
 
It's my life I live it up
The cup I gotta give it up
One day
I'm cruisin' down a one way street and I done passed fun day
Three blocks ago
It itself life is an obstacle
As I maneuver through the manure I try to be responsible
I want a job but I ain't lookin' how come
I ain't tryin' to degrade myself bein' nobody's Calvin
But I'm a couch bum what makes it bad I had incentive
But I disintegrated
To a state that's stagnated
I procrastinated
I can't recall a day without bein' intoxicated
Or blowed
Ain't dealin' with a full deck and any day I could fold
What makes it bad, I wasn't dealt that bad a hand
And I had a plan
But things didn't go through
The way they were supposed to
Thank God I found you
It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from goin' under, I ponder
And try to keep my concentration
In this idiotic nation
They say become I doctor, but I don't have the patients/patience
Adjacent
To that situation
I want an occupation
That I'm into
'Cause yet if I begin to
Live to my potential
I went to
School for fourteen years and my best teacher was experience
I reminisce and wish
I could go back in time to eighty-nine
When there was just sunshine
But now it's like I'm gettin' older to so much strain and stress
I don't think I'll ever be happy until I rest
In peace
Of mind
And find
Who I am
But thank God I found you",Book of Life

And I prefer compliments
So I complement at an angle, of ninety degrees

I met this girl, when I was ten years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She was old school, when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular, not a church girl she was secular
Not about the money, those studs was mic checking her
But I respected her, she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas, had did her in the park
But she was there for me, and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
And just cool out, cool out and listen to her
Sitting on a bone, wishing that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be
Cause we related, physically and mentally
And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around

She didn't have a body but she started getting thick quick
Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave, in goes the braids beads medallions
She was on that tip about stopping the violence
About my people she was teaching me
By not preaching to me, but speaking to me in a method that was leisurely
So easily I approach
She dug my rap, that's how we got close
But then she broke to the West coast, and that was cool
Cause around the same time, I went away to school
And I'm a man of expanding, so why should I stand in her way
She probably get her money in L.A
And she did stud, she got big pub but what was foul
She said that the pro-black, was going out of style
She said, Afrocentricity, was of the past
So she got into R&B hip-house bass and jazz
Now black music is black music and it's all good
I wasn't salty, she was with the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her, she was becoming well rounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit

Once the man got to her, he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy

She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs, looking rock and dressing hippie
And on some dumb shit, when she comes to the city
Talking about popping Glocks serving rocks and hitting switches
Now she's a gangsta rolling with gangsta bitches
Always smoking blunts and getting drunk
Telling me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk
Stressing how hardcore and ""real"" she is
She was really the realest, before she got into showbiz
I did her, not just to say that I did it
But I'm committed, but so many niggas hit it
That she's just not the same letting all these groupies do her

The fellas nod and the chicks dance 
While I'm coolin' in my jumpers and my big pants 
I'm as dope as PCP, MC's see me and start having flashbacks 
I don't flash scratch, I gotta watch my back 
Now a days blacks don't know how to act, besides Larry Fishburn 
Charles Jug and Wesley Snipes, marks want to test me because I test the mics 
I check 'em like sound, and like loose I'm down 
Plus I done got better since Soul By the Pound, I maintain 

[Chorus: x4]
 
[Verse 3]
I fall fresh upon the spirit, with the lyric that's overwhelming 
And house more hoes then Spellman, worse unwelcome like James Johnston 
My brains sponsoring speech on the mic, I'm like a Jackson 
Rappers I'm fondling, they try to settle out of court 
But I, could never be bought, what type of rebel eats pork? 
I'll take the cat and never get caught, you wack together we fought 
Cause I can't see my melons boxing if he's not boxin' with 'em 
I don't care who started it, I'm gonna be apart of it 
Regardless of the odds of how hard 
It's been many times we was outnumbered and we still got with them 
I got rhythm from some boogers and some foxes 
But if I becomes a 10 then some brothers all some gin 
And I got juice, and this niggas scared 
I'll F your head up, like the L.A. 4, when I flow for cash I got for 
Broke like Mel for Moore 
Why should a male with a B8 get more then me? 
When Rashid got an MC degree, and a doctorine in rockin' shit I go to docs to get 
A fish wish with cheese, I don't mix with MCs, cause I just don't like 
The motherfucker
But I'm still maintaining 

[Chorus]",Maintaining
Common,"Check it on the one you Com is gonna come [Repeat: x3] 
And check it out ha.
 
[Verse 1]
My raps do laps around tracks to the days 
The idiot vibin' I'm the comma comma Chameleon 
I use to pop the willy on my blue and gray sting ray 
It had maxed I was with bitches that had coochie 
Bassum wasn't rollin' Starters looking harder than niggas 
Hoes wore clothes that exposed their figures 
Ain't 7 steps in the jam, next the police come 
Heist there would be one, numbers I would get at least one 
We come to the get together with whatever 
You wouldn't know how deep it was, we all did shit together 
Eat up all your vittles, drink your brew and then step to 
The next cue, let's do it again y'all 
That was when mad was tall and phat was cold 
The days of Old Chicago and Fun Town and shorties we run round 
Play strike outs till sun down, but the shit ain't as fun now 
And the city is all run down, we troop down to Jew Town 
Talking cat down on some gear, have enough for a Polish incom fair 
I stare, at what use to be Bubbles and think about who use to cop our 
Liquor 
(Who?) Our neighborhood father figure 

[Chorus]
I'm out with my crew, ain't nuthin' to do but ah, 
""Niggas be rollin'"" Ol' Dirty Bastard from Protect Ya Neck 
Ain't nowhere to go, so I hook up with a hoe while I 
""Niggas be rollin'"" 
Gotta make a stop take a leak and get some chops cause um 
""Niggas be rollin'"" 
We gonna hit the streets for some brew and some eats cause um 
""Niggas be rollin'"" 

[Verse 2]
I got more rhymes then the Manor got folks had style 
Since I went to McDowl, wearin' boats 
And penny loafers know I had the nickel in mines 
We use to hoop in my yard but now I dribble the rhyme 
It's like rain drops couldn't make our game stop 
Skeeter will hit from the SAME spot 
Torla tore my shit down, get down, put your body in motion 
Only the strong survive, but on the 6 or the 5 
Live as hot as sex use to be at the Racket 
Wrong club with music by Andre Hatchet 
Or either Beat Box Ferris at them country club parties 
Would be hot as hell and house stud would get ""Find a body!"" 
Sawyers I would go there, hip hop clubs were so rare 
I like the music anyways and it was always hoes there 
Was said to have the best chicks but mostly High Park and V hoes 
Is who I mess with, the best shit was troopin' to the loop 
With your posisions held class crooked ass but still go the division 
(I remember that) Over Yamela's crib while his old girl was at work 
Bust a smoothie on the spread, but sill have some on your shirt 

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I tuned into BMX and taped Farly on the tone master 
I took the 6 instead of the 28 to get home faster 
Then HBK was the only station that would fuck with rap 
You was on the shore by yourself castin' stay up your act 
What you could make of it, you was a gump they was takin' shit 
Either fight or break for it, we go to the lake and get full 
My drink there was Boons and Red Bull 
I remember swimming in Avenlon, and being in a pool 
I thought I was cool, with my ""members only"" and a bold fade 
Wall to wall greens to get the sport gray and palmade 
And soft breasts, as we got older we would star crush and bang fags 
Go to Marshals and change tags, I snagged nuff niggas 
And games are off the wall, in softball, Piggy one I would call 
When I first got my three way callin', I caught Marsh tryin' to lie 
Home of the original gangbangers, and ain't nobody shot 

[Chorus]",Nuthin' to Do

I'mma sip on it, check it out

I got a rhyme, you got a rhyme

I'm the act to follow, housing kids like Ronald
Mac like Donald Goines, flows I change like coins
Choyoyoyyoyoyyng, choyoyoyyyyng, choyoyoyoyyyyyng
I draw a crowd like blood with the 'pint of' technique
And everybody there be like, ""YEAH!""
Cause cain't near a nig dat'll say 'Whoomp, There It Is'
I'm like a mom on section 8, over-bearing kids
Shit they be like, ""Com-mon!"" That's my muhfucka (true)
Youse a hamburger, I'mma Fuddrucker
Askin me to let us catch up, knowin you can't cut the mustard
So where's the beef, jerky?
I'm as Worthy as James, not that good with names
But I do remember your face from someplace this is one taste
Of Chicago, we got mo' many mo' many mo' many mo' flavors
Don't just come to me, go ask thy neighbor-I'm-a-hood takin niggas under
On the tundra, cause ""they're plain, they're plain""
I'm on a plateau that is fat so
It's just a fan-tasy, for the fans to see
How I land, I'm grand like a finale
I'm goin back to Cali (why?) cause Cali got bitches check it

Hey yo Chicago, we gotta rock on and

Ah down South, you gotta rock on and
Check it ""Now you can go!""

Mister Pussy Emcee, just get on gone
Get on gone, you pussy MC!
Steppin to me, with them dirty feets you'll get defeated
Like Kunta Kinte, I'm kin to the Lynn crew
My great, great, grandpap done been through
So much it's in my hemoglobin to be a ill nigga
So I figure like a father... that I'mma Turn This Mutha Out
But Common you ain't hittin in New York
I don't know what you thought hops, but chief I got tall props
Some cats think I'm six feet I'm so deep
Some stunts be thinkin I'm six-fo', my shit be hittin like switches
Bitches, ask, why my, britches, sag
I ask the bitches, ""Why your titties saggin?""
Put your nipple to the bottle I bust rhymes like breastses
I can get down, d-d-d-down like pessimist
""Ring the Alarm"", I got Charm like a neck-a-lace
Tell the truth, tell the truth, y'all had to move your neck to this
Didn't you, didn't you and it, and it, and it
And it don't stop, bust it",Orange Pineapple Juice
Common,"[Pops]
Hey, hey old bean
And you to baby sweetness
Yeah, this is Pops, and I'm back in the studio
And I didn't have to break in this time
I'm back as a special guest by special request
And I want to thank my son for loaning me this microphone once again
They may have to wrestle to get it back
You know, as a result of my son Common touring the world
Pops has acquired a wonderful extended family
From around the globe
He has returned with positive messages to my earlobes
From all my children From Mexico, Brazil, Italy, Japan
And of course in the motherland
Even in the orient, they know what I meant
Nanaan, tanaan, tinaan, hanchinaan
So I didn't come in here to give any shouts out
I came to give praise and honor and to identify my children
Who've been saying and doing the right things
You know they sat on those nines of 1999 
And kept them from turning upside down
And teaching the babies
To love, to be able to G
I've love
And to enter the new century with their own prophecy
The century of amends
You see I deal with the premise that all children are ours
And that we all travel the same path
It's just that we don't get there at the same time
(See you next lifetime) See you next lifetime
And to my children running around here 
Talking about how nice is they ice 
That they've already paid for twice
What karat is they gold
That was yours before you were done in the hole
Or that crew from 1629, buy some land
Think agriculture, beat that neighborhood 
Which you claim you love so dear
Are you mankind or what kind of a man?
 
See, Pops is straight out of the garden
From when the world was starting brand new,
Hip Hop, Hip Hop, the language of the underground railroad
In it's purest form
Yeah true hip hop is just like the Underground Railroad
If the message is not for you
It can sit on your nose and your brain remain froze
So when you see me traveling on a spiritual high
I'm flying high with Cee-Lo
Or maybe watching my long's hear
T dancing to a De La flow
Everybody knows there's no fruit on the tree with The Roots
And Black Star said we are what we are
The Knowledge Of Self Determination
And my little homie KG
Up there in Minnesota milking 10000 lakes
Keep the heat on em', we got to be kind to the growing mind
So if your heart is real
You will hear Big Will and Ms. Lauryn Hill
If your love is true, you will hear Badu-ism
And you can't go right until you go left 
And get some ingredients from the music chef Jazzy Jeff
Children, I've traveled this globe
North to south, east to west
And whenever my soul appears lost
I turn to the musical stylings of a Tribe Called Quest
Okay, we ready to get out of here
We ready to take it home now
Just so everybody knows
When Pops get ready to say something good
I mean when it's time for me to lay it on the wood
And it ain't no time for no shecky shecky
That's when I turn to a Black Girl Named Betty
Y'all looking for the only truth and it doesn't even exist
I just come to give love and peace and honor t
Oh all my children",Pop's Rap
Common,"I stagger in the gathering possessed by a patter-in
That be scattering
Over the global my vocals be traveling unraveling my abdomen
It's slime that's babbling grammatics that are masculine
I grab the men, verbally badgering broads
I wish that Madeline was back on Video LP
I went against all odds and got a even steven
Proceed to read and not believing everything I'm reading
But my brain was bleeding, needing feeding and exercise
I didn't seek the best of buys, it's a lie to textualize
I analyze where I rest my eyes
And chastise the best of guys with punchlines
I'm Nestle when it's crunch-time
For your mind like one time
If poetry was pussy I'd be sunshine
Cause I deliver like the Sun-Times
Confined in once-mines on dumb rhymes I combine
I'm hype like I'm unsigned, my diet I un-swine
Eating beef sometimes -- I try to cut back on that shit
This rap shit is truly outta control
My style is too developed to be arrested
It's the freestyle, so now it's out on parole
They tried to hold my soul in a holding cell so I would sell
I bonded with a break and had enough to make bail
A Mr. Meaner fell on his knee for the jury
I asked No for his ID and the judge thought there was two of me
Motion for a recess to retest my fingerprints
They relinquished Sense, cause I was guilty in a sense

I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike when in dim light
I use insight to enlight devices hit the skin tight
Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe, imagination's in flight
I send light, like Ben's kite I've been bright
Get open like on gym nights and in fights I send rights
Don't hook with skins my friends like I spend nights up in dykes
In spite, I've been indicted as a freak of all trades
I got it made
I bathe in bass lines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums
Come from a tribe of bums hooked on Negro and mums
Had to halt with the malt liquor
Cause off the malt liquor, I fought niggas, now my speech and thoughts quicker
Cruising Southside streets with no heat and no sticker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't, now check it
I'm a ho but not a ho nigga, ain't scared of no nigga
But it's my turn to go I gotta go
And I'm gone with the storm",Resurrection
Common,"Marks I erase like racism, I'm as large as a bigot
Groove is my escapism, when I'm bubbly I just kick it
What I need from you is understanding that I'm standing
On my own two, down with my own crew
Toe cancer, I'm bad to the bone too, I'm prone to snap off
When I'm off that Cognac I can't hold back like a massouse
I get loose like a screw turned from left right to tight
When it's time for some action I get Red's ""Tonight's the Night""
An eye for an eye, a life for his wife
Dissected I'm on some hi-tech shit computers want to bite
Your style is Pascal, mine is Basic and just instinct
I'm with the fam and ran scams, me and Murray got up on big links
And if knowledge is the key, goddammit I'm the locksmith
Started a missionary way on my life, the mic I rust like bostage
I switch styles like a channel with controls that are remote
Engage in a page, and with words I elope
Walking down the aisles with styles I freak the viles
Anti-Nazi when I rocks like a Z-28
At any rate, brothers gain interest because I loaned them microphones
They couldn't house the shit so they had to rent to own
It's like that, coming from the go rapper
I want to bone Jada Pinkett and that hoe Patra
So keep on, and you don't, now come on
Ah keep on, and you don't

Sometime when I'm alone in my room I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear a wack-ass rhyme
And I catch Alz-rhymers, then forget it, I get charged
Like a nigga in position with the stolen card the credit
Fuck flipping the script, the rap scene I'm trying to edit
My mellows call me ""Never"", they be like ""Nevers going to get it""
 
Nevers too much, I'm much too, I do justice to poetics
That's why cats be like 'Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!'
Other studs come through to see what I am up to
They be on the dick of crew that be giving us sweet and buying us fruit
Like Kareem I got the hook up, brothers look out because they look
Rest in peace to Heavena, washing tons of rappers like Booker
Tee told me 'You gotta get out of the crib, get into the world'
How you going to come off with the style that's thorough?
It's like that, keep on, ha ha
It's like that, keep on

My foundation is in black block of niggas that rock they hat cock
I'm real like a fight with my rap, rappers I slapbox
Back I got my rap, now get your glock out the black face
Got tall flavor with fat taste, the rat race is a rat race
Just cause you got Adidas with the fat laces and the fro don't make you hip-hop
You sorry excuse for funk rap
Why is there so many cranks trying to rhyme, yo funk that
The real shit's starting to come back
The Go is where I'm from and where I'm at, jack
I started eating cat when I was 10
Before dinner I was getting big dog like Glen Robinson
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
But comes a time when you gotta get off of that booty
The facts of life I didn't learn from watching Tootie
But living in the big city but I still like Tootie cause she got big titties
My style is steep, I write rhymes on the incline
Splat guts plus fat nuts and lay up like a crib line
I'm slamming, jamming on the one
I'm a bad man, you're just a good son, come on",Sum Shit I Wrote

Good Morning Viet-Com, I'm back
HUH! It's me again
Is it me you're looking for? (Yup)
For the perfect beat, sweetly oblique
I'm fresh, I come clean, but I can't whistle
Psss, I'm only bugging
While No dug in the crates, I dug in my nose
And picked a rhyme any rhyme I don't have any time
To waste, I'm hip... don't even trip
To an easy travel agent now we fly for free
I can be fly for free, you want some flyer to read
Then buy from me
I got the flame like you-I-see but I be, you-A-see
Some of the realest illest chillest cats you may see
In your life if you get one
Rappers are like jobs to me (why?) because they get done
Here it comes I'm as Able as Cain to get raw
That's why the DJ's mix me, I'm gonna bust dicks
This is not the bomb so save all your threats
I'm good to go and also I'm Rets
Rhymes I wrecks affects the roughnecks
Down to the preps in the Polos, the studs with fros
Hoes with weaves, the bald-headed to the dreaded
To folks with butters, high rollers in rollers
Players with plats studs with stockin caps I be rockin raps
Til I collapse
Niggas play my tape about as much as they do craps
I'm on point, I celo, I see high
Hi see, I'm free at last
I'ma free man, free as the world be
And like an early bird, I'm special
But you ain't that special, as that investor
So to myself I say congratulations
I'm glad you had the patience, you better have the patience
Cause this is me

[Chorus: x3]

Whats up Scony Rony I'm that boney homey
From Stoney (Common) you know me!
Off the GP niggas see me on the TV
Talking Take It EZ, and they was like ""He ain't hardcore!""
But hardcore is far more than bats and gats
It stems back to the roots of being true
It's gonna get me Me, you just get you You
What I look like, talking about some shit I ain't do?
I ain't shoot nobody I ain't shank nobody
I ain't kill nobody, it wasn't us it was THEM!
The Warriors, I'm a warrior and still don't have to sho-gun
It takes one to know one, and no one can tell me
How to be, cause I'ma be me, aight?
Cause I'm a man, now check it

[Chorus: x3]

Sometimes, sometimes, I get a good feeling!
When I'm chilling at the flat, looking at the wall
Wondering can I come off of it, I'm off a bit
On the mic I be talking shit
But some say my talk don't make no Sense
I'm trying to make the Dollars, my momma told me
To go to school and be a scholar, but school ain't for me
So don't even go there, I'm coming out of nowhere, to go where
Probably in about seven years, I won't have no hair
But not only am I the Hair Club President, I'm also a client
I come off like a toupee, I still have to pay 2Pc Dark
A Raider that never Lost the Ark/arc, on the shot
But now when I shoot rock, I be all out of breath
My boy Adefo wanted to be a chef
But he went down South, and fell in love call me love
Cause love is gonna getcha I'ma getcha
I'm like B.J. my Arm is Strong and I Stretch ya
Styles from East to West, all across the country
I'm like that big fat woman cause cats want to bump me
I probably would get bumped more if I was a gangster
But I am a gangsta, call me the gangsta of love!
I love my music, I love my momma
I love myself, I love you, and you love me
And this is, I'm out

(KRS sample plays in background)
Yo I want to say peace to my moms, my grand momma
Lil Chandra, and John, yo rest in peace to my Aunt Stella

Common,"I express like an interstate
Hyper when I ventilate
My rap pieces penetrate and infiltrate your mental state
Just to reiterate
That I innovate
Bonin' broads when they men-estruate
I spend a great time with the rhyme
More than I did any female
I derailed your train of thought
Because your brain was caught
On some other man's thinking
Now your third eye is blinking
My rhymes be kicking like a brother's breath be stinking
I get funky for sure while you're *sniff* unsure
If you got beef, chief, then let that shit unthaw
This track was a broad
I'd be bonin the shit out of it
Bang, bang, bang then see what I can get out of her
Probably some scratch clothes and some J's
I got six million ways to rhyme
Choose one
I stand out like a nigga on a hockey team
I got goals, and I can like a pop machine
I come clean
Like a fiend in Chi I'm down with rehab
Stir my style crazy
Cause that's right, we bad, we bad
Pryor to Richard I was that crazy nigga
Cause I kick ass
And when I wreck it other rappers be like ""whiplash!""

It's like I come to the party in a b-boy stance
I rock on the mic and make the girls want to dance
I come to the party in a b-boy stance
I rock on the mic and make the girls want to dance
Me without a lyric, is like a nigga without a beeper
I'm a blow this shit out, cuz I'm the joint like reefer
If Barry White was in the mob
I still would be deeper
Cause I had lyrics back when I used to run with Keyvin
MC's step to me, butt-ass naked like ""What's up?""
I said, ""You know you done fucked up
Now I'm sayin, ""You know you done fucked up""
Everybody that hear me say I'm jams like the NBA
Cause I'm on fire
If I was a Michelin I wouldn't tire
It's funny how time flies
Well I'm as fly as time
I don't believe in role models
But if I do, then I'm mine
I make brothers say ""True""
They see you and be like ""Fiction""
I want 'spect and dead presidents
Like Richard Nixon
I'm a coach not a player
Not a gay mc, I'm straighter
My style is similiar to AIDS
You can f with it now
But catch you later
You can't touch this, cuz this is what I'm feelin bro

I come to grips with mics
I come to grips that a lot of mic users is dikes
I come to grips with the likes of Fred Hampton
Cold, so I'm lampin, with no need for spotlight
When I got light like an intersection, you talk
But you came to my town with protection
Election year, had the block hot
I scream 'fuck the world' for having a baby girl sorta cock block
I write rhymes like I come from the windy city
With my crew, I click like simply, stand midi with reality
Casually, I walk through these war games
Some claim say but then they take on whore names
If that's the way your sex drives, stay in your lane
If you're a man, I can't tell like if the door rang now

Now, to the ladies in the house when you come in the place
It ain't a bunch of niggaz all up in your face
The music is thumpin and you're feelin the bass
What you want to do girl(wanna shout)
To the brothas when you come in a jam, it ain't a bunch of niggaz
It ain't high tech and ain't got free liquor
You jackin his name and stick to make you jones get thicker
What you want to do man?(let go)
Yo, check it

Some niggaz be on the mic, sounding like dikes
Allow me to get on and bust like Spike(uh)
Lee, I'm in the majors with no rotation
Through stations of bullshit, I see through like a pager
In the age of Aquarius, various things
Is gonna carry us in intellect and what have you
 
Street astrologists interpret point stars and half moons
Then end up on garages or walls in bathrooms
Every black moon, a rap tune move me
The rap sun, I rain more than Rudy, that unruly shit is played
It don't stop
It's time to get it, get it made
I got my mind made up like Foxy Brown's face
I know how the underground tastes
I want a crib from the ground up, rooms spin at a round pace
Get down based on true story, through Corey, came close to the teachers
Colder as the Iceman, posted before it start wrinklin
Linkin with cats, who don't react to change in the years
Fulfill prophesies in rooms full of emptiness, now

I can feel the funk
Yo, check it, check it

I came through the corridor, with the aura
Raw Chicago mora, scope the horror
Read between the lines and know the border
Some pop wines for juice, I wait in the water
Waitin for you Big Willie niggaz to have a show at The Crib
We gon get with your glamour, long as we know where it is
Tell you ain't a player by your sweater doused with wack feather
The Crib got the gangsta playa shit patent like black leather
I rap better than you, you, or maybe him
But I am like a tree and every lyric is a timb
Spilled brews and greasy foods got my car smelly
Some be so high, they believe they fly like R. Kelly
But then they fall off, dusted niggaz is gettin sawed off
They fall soft, my mental lift is for me to haul off
I kick ass

Came to the set splashed, no Roley on the wrist 
To Hell with a guest list, we all up in this! 
A two dollar somethin got your eyes on him 
But yo she pinchin my ass so we go, limb for limb 
Lights studio dim, it's EXACT tonight 
So we can drop the Rap Delight, on one!

""Just get on down"" 

Underground under pressure, my style is the child 
of a lesser, God, I Master like Farad 
The sign of in between the El Rook'n, and El DeBarge 
Metaphorically massage, verbal hajj 
I take over breaks and chop loops 
Glorifyin, one-eighty hat cats can rock in my troops 
Wisdom like a tooth, mock new shits I knock loose 
Datin game Thursday's I spot juice, Plug like Pos'nus 
Before you get a style, let's get a style 
My style has the crowd back and forth 
You were soft as the tracks you rappin off, I pop shit 
You tried to laugh it off, actin like you had to cough 
and didn't hear it, my spirit sustains in the same pattern 
emcee, familiar sample period; spottin where you sampled 
your rhyme scheme from -- I ain't clearin it 
I drop science and experiment -- contractually 
came to terms of endearment with my label 
Want to pick out a day to smack wack niggaz, I contact niggaz 
like P.O.'s, you spit background lyrics, I rip Lee flows 
Wipin your nose like you need blows 
Claimin it's a allergy, I react allergic to cats 
or is it how they word it 
If you had weight it must have been some pussy you served with 
Thoughts for a minute, I rode rhythms and words tenant 
Many lip profess, I'm verb sentences 

Just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
Just dance, ah come on and get down 
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
Just dance, ah come on and get down 
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
Just dance, ah come on and get down 
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
Just dance, ah come on and get down 
""Just get on down"" 

It's like rip why'all, add it on to lip 
Wonder Why's upon this, just to flex my strength 
I was the one who killed wackness so I had to do a bid 
of twelve years on the mic, before parole with Tommy 'Kid' 
Infinite landscaper, green paper maker 
Leap far from home with chrome rims and trims 
Man these people still takin rappin for a joke 
The pimp, I rock it one-double-oh percent 
Some of you MC's should be called CM's, Carbon Monoxide 
on the mic exposin your polluted bloodtype 
why'all niggaz need a visit from the Brain Fairy 
Walk around dead, like your physical's buried 
Wrote the rhymes durin a earthquake, cause your style's 
shaky as SHIT! Just need to come clean and admit 
that yo' quick draw fails the test, and mine was flawless 
My DJ gave the scratch, yours was clawless 
Your crew couldn't even measure to mine 
That's why yo' bitches is busted, and mines is fine 
Performin with an upper design, so back on off the plank 
We bringin this Big and Bad like Hank 

Just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
Just dance, ah come on and get down 
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
Just dance, ah come on and get down

One Day It'll All Make Sense, by me
What I want to do to you nah, really it's for you
Is open my mental window, hoping that you would climb in
Or if not, at least look in
I want to take you to places that I have been and to 
The places that I want to go. I mean this music
It ain't all that I got, but it does mean a lot to me
I injected my whole being into it, and I've been doing it for a while
It's like my whole life has become a style
I want to get into it yeah",Introspective
Common,"Envisioning the hereafter, listenin to Steve Wonder
On a Quest for Love like the Proceed drummer
I strike like lightning and don't need thunder
Inhale imagination and breathe wonder
That's your lady, I used to run up in her and G weed from her
It's a cold world and niggaz need summer
At times my going forward seems like retreat 
As I rewrite rhyme after rhyme and throw away beats
Growing into my britches, outgrowing the streets
There's a thin line between war and peace, whores and jeeps
Ignore MCs like beeps, scribblin freedom on pages
My third eye is like pink eye, seemin contagious
Redeemin the ancients with ace this rhyme jargon
I feel Mexican, hip hop is my garden
Don't give a fuck where you chartin, certain shit I can't honor
 
It ain't that you sellin, it's your karma
Rappers I monitor like a chaperone, you large and haven't grown
Poetically perform fly-bys, another rapper gone
The stage becomes a catacomb, I rap like a mummy
Not for the money, I could have sampled Diana Ross a long time ago
My mind of flow is like motor key 20
Youngblood said he had dimes, I prayed that he see twenty
Hollerin at the brothers, either you gon be a thug or a man
Flip drugs and get land, I can see my man Rashad
As he described how the bucks hit him
And said slugs was still stuck in him, when it rained, it fucked wit him

And I'm a make the name Canibus a name you fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware

I can tell by how you write, you the type to run in a fight
I hold mics while you hold spite
Like a broken-hearted bitch
Don't give no fuck who your team or who you started with
Cameoed or charted with, I house niggas like apartments with
Mic mechanisms, I dissect a rhythm
Move crowds with kinetic wisdom
It's like a Malcolm X-orcism, fuck the rhythm, I hit him
I want him got and I get him, auction his wack ass off, then bid him

I'm creating the ultimate verses with perfect lines
Putting together the web of my rhyme one thread at a time
So you niggas need to stop testing me
Because you know you can't ""F"" with me
Stepping to me with insuperior weaponry
Exposing yourself to the verbal radiations
Saying you can defeat me is nothing but speculation
Lyrics unravel, faster than bullets travel through barrels
Niggas be digging my styles like fossils and pterodactyls
Who want to battle?
I'm bad to the bone marrow
The Earth got one sun but I walk with three shadows
With Allah, my supernatural bodyguard
Niggas couldn't touch me if they gave me a massage
MCs will compete with lyrics and beats get crushed
I'll hit you in your chest so hard, your shoulders will touch

""Stepping to me is like going to the county being a neutron""
""I ain't scared of no nigga""

I pursue sound fairs, relaxed like Dru Down's hair
Other nigga's rhymes are like gang signs, I throw down theirs
On knots, I landed, players get played like Hamlet
Supposedly nice, taken for granted like life
I write twice and drop singles in record pools
Niggas I'm dunking like when cops mingle
Fuck hip-hop jingles, rhyming big words and not saying shit
The clique that you came in with accent your flavor with
Like moose, I go to the caves and get niggas off all fours
I'm the shit that's uncalled for, the shit that you fall for
Far more advanced than a rapper whose career
You could only take a glance
Couldn't make the transition from B-boy to C-note stance
I stand in a circumference of humbleness
But in the Chi rumble it's
Mistaken as a weakness, when poetry's in motion
Like a picture, I'm the main feature
Amongst hard working teachers and corrupt preachers
I make my living off of singles like Latifah
In between sheets like reefer with blunted senses
You couldn't make a statement if you was from a sentence
I'm cold with numb intentions

""Fucking with Canibus""

Yo, the Canibus is a animal with a mechanical mandible
Coming to damage you, spitting understandable slang at you
I be the all seeing lyrical, hammerhead shark peripheral
With three-hundred sixty degree visual
When the signal was given, MCs get bitten with venom
From a poisonous algorithm liable to kill 'em
My style will get in 'em, way up in 'em
My face don't belong in The Source
It belongs on the Shroud of Turin
For certain, I grab mics and murder shit
It's wickeder than Satan worshipers going to Catholic church services
You heard of this
The lyrical verbalist slash herbalist
The wrath of my cold-blooded verses is merciless
Rap snap, get your ass cracked like bear traps
Contaminate your air sacs like tear gas
And I swear black, try to battle me, you won't last
I'll turn your ass into the artist formerly known as
You gay ass fag, I'll blow you to ashes with tactics
Strip you naked, then make you hug a cactus, you bastard
So phat to be a rap star, taking pictures at music seminars
People know who you are
Now I got mad shorties that wanna call me because they saw me
Up in The Source chilling on page 40

That was sweating me off the Music Makes Me High remix
I be talking mad trash, trying to get them to laugh
See, if I click and drag long enough, I'll get the ass
Bring it back to the lab on Mount Prospect Ave
Let your chicken suck me off and send her home in a cab
You know how we do, liquid aluminum like the T2
Beast from the East part 2, coming to see you

It's time I made the name Com Sense a name y'all fear

Real nigga quotes I tote, got some shit on the free but
This some shit that I wrote, legendary like the goat
Who got game?
Giving a quarter rest while I make these quarter notes
My album, niggaz was expectin, now my water broke
Before it, I was sorta broke
Get the paper for the funnies, sports and the horoscope
On a curry goat, like flu stokes order coke
You sharp with your rings and chain but you short a rope
At the end of the road trip still, I'ma hold shit down like syndrome
Rappers are like Fox Brown tryin to get home
Rarely get your touchdown, I'm in the end zone
You can't honor what I'm on, then bitch nigga, get gone
>From the wind storm, I've been told the street folklore
Body language spoke raw, don't talk to broads that are spoke for
That provokes war, stand out like cold sores
You claim that you hard but you wholecore

On ill raps, I spit as if I had a bad cough
This Craig nigga stole a style and ain't take the tag off
Playin yourself, you can't come with it, so you jack off
More heart than an artery, jones in my bones
To see thugs in harmony, it's gonna be some drama
If you try to sit Com down, this ain't comedy

Commonly, I hear these rats thinkin they mahogany
On every rap hook, soundin like a dog to me

Common,"It's a frantic situation

Extra salty cause whoever beat me, got me for this 31-inch
And this Alpha Bailey jacket I had just bought me
Out of snapping, my guy tried to talk me
But what could get me half way calm was this Donny Hathaway song
The tape that it was on I had wanted while I was gone
But forgot to pack it, in fact it was in that jacket
This demo, it's time to track it and lay it down
Either it's somebody I know or somebody I stay around
Day before I broke out, niggas was over my crib getting smoked out
No telling who had the place scoped out
Dot had brought over some niggas I didn't know
I'm asking who are you, they said I'm here with the Mo
If it was them, soon I'mma collide with them
And they better not be rocking no new Iversons
Then it could have been this hype that usually shovel my snow
If I'm out of town or not, by my car he would know
Now it might have been this stripper I met at Pinkhouse party
Thick, but my furniture wasn't worth her body
What if it was this nigga I let sleep in my crib?
They had a set of keys, but that I wasn't trying to believe
But I couldn't put it past him or them other bastards
It'd be assed backwards for me to ask if they did it
Cause whoever did ain't gon' admit it
The blunt and dirty dishes is my only exhibit
Wondering if I should give it a rest and through the wind it might surface
Cause telling the law, Joe, is worthless

There was a Hardy Boy mystery I was trying to solve
Can't understand who the fuck was involved
Back from a show I had came, hopped off the plane
In my mind home was pictured and rest was the frame
My guy came to grab me in something less than a Caddy
Go buy them gas and food was less than a cabby
As we approach my tilt, paranoia in my bones had built
By the lock on the door, a hole was drilled
I opened it to the kitchen floor my heart knelt
In my shit, somebody had broke in like a mitt
My mind started swinging and who I thought the glove fit
As usual, niggas is suspects
Who did I tell I was going out of town?
Not too many people, I guess the word got around
The people upstairs should have been disturbed by the sound
Must have came in during the day when at work they was found
At the mound I stand vocal pitch high, asking who done it
Fuck Hitchcock, I got the fifth cocked, about to go Wild Hundreds
Whoever did it had the nerve to chill, and get blunted
And left a roach in the ash tray I had cleaned out the last day
Before I left, this thief decided to play chef
Overlooked beef in the fridge to cook chicken breast
I'm kicking what shit was left all around the house
Thinking whoever came in on me is out

The perseverance of a rebel I drop heavier levels
It's unseen or heard, a king with words
Can't knock the hustle, but I've seen street dreams deferred
Dark spots in my mind where the scene occurred
Some say I'm too deep, I'm in too deep to sleep
Through me, Muhammad will forever speak
Greet brothers with handshakes in ghetto landscapes
Where a man is determined by how much a man make
Cop Cognacs and spit old raps with young cats
With cigarettes in their ear, niggerish they appear
Under the Fubu is a guru, that's untapped
Want to be in the rap race but ain't ran one lap
Ran so far from the streets that you can't come back
You tripping with nowhere to unpack, forgot that

In front of two-inch glass and Arabs I order fries
Inspiration when I write, I see my daughter's eyes
I'm the truth, across the table from corporate lies
Immortalized by the realness I bring to it
If revolution had a movie I'd be theme music
My music, you either fight, fuck, or dream to it
My life is one big rhyme, I try to scheme through it
Through my shell, never knew what the divine would bring to it
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want millions
More than money saved, I want to save children
Dealing with alcoholism and afrocentricity
A complex man drawn off of simplicity
Reality is frisking me
This industry will make you lose intensity
The Common Sense in me remembers the basement
I'm Morpheus in this hip-hop Matrix, exposing fake shit

Some days I take the L to gel with the real world
Got on at 87th, stopped by this little girl
She recited raps, I forgot where they was from
In 'em, she was saying how she made brothers cum
I start thinking, how many souls hip-hop has affected
How many dead folks this art resurrected
How many nations this culture connected
Who am I to judge one's perspective?
Though some of that shit y'all pop true it, I ain't relating
If I don't like it, I don't like it, that don't mean that I'm hating
I just want to innovate and stimulate minds
Travel the world and penetrate the times
Escape through rhythms in search of peace and wisdom

For now I appreciate this moment in time

Dealing with golf, getting blowed on the course
I be dissing magazines, but then buy the source
Can't explain why the force, is with me
Known to bring a rapper down, like bobby did Whitney
Sophisticated sissies strut like this is beat street in backpacks
Bragging how they don't eat meat and abstract
I backsmack em with they skateboard, flee the crime scene
With a rhyme scheme to escape frauds

Motherfucker move back, I pursue rap at the pace of a New Jack
Miscellaneous numbers and shoes stack grooves
Rap I deliver for the hungry and underprivileged
Something different from these hollow and grunting niggas
This is business strictly, step to my business is risky
'Specially when you as bitch as Missy
Back to back LP's that sound the same, I surround the game
With a four-pounded brainstorm
To make niggas dance in the rain, scared to take a chance in the game
Used to break dance, it's a shame
What money do to a nigga brain
If he lose his soul what did a nigga gain?

""Doin' it, doin' it, I am doin' it,  C O double M O to the N""

My train of thought is that of a hustler, or a nigga with his shirt off
Trying to get his work off to customers
I rap with a chip on my shoulder, squeezing Coronas
See shirts that say ""We gotta get over""
That juggy shit is over, the war is on
I only want to be a soldier, I'm holding on, to a culture
Focused like Gordon Parks when it's sorta dark
For niggas that's flooded with ice, my thought's the ark
Performing warming arts with some shit for the heart
Don't fuck with radio, ignoring the charts
I could give a fuck what you made in a year, nigga, you wack
A soft nigga on a hard track, in this new rap
Generation I ""X"" cats like a Muslim
He fell off cause I pushed him
Let his Bentley and his weak crew be his cushion
I catch him on the streets, in front of the bodyguards and rush him

""Doin' it, doin' it, I am doin' it,  C O double M O to the N""

You wasn't saying you was a thug before Pac came
Ten years ago you had a high top trying to be like Kane
Then Snoop released and it became a G thing
Claim sets, your city ain't got gangs
Niggas hate you, they ain't paying you no attention
In a circle of fagots, your name is mentioned
With six degrees, I separate MC's, from a business man that's good
From a nigga that was raised or just lived in the hood
From what a nigga says to what's understood
Keep my shit tight like them boys in ""The Wood""
Dick is always hard like the ""Boyz in the Hood""
Peace to Dug Inf, No I, Sean Lett, the whole Chi
At the crib some cats give me the cold eye
I'm a bitch slap the next one

I'm nationally recognized, locally accepted
I pimp with the truth, that's the only method

And Chevy windows be rattlin
And badder than any other broads that I've seen in these parts
Her body language spoke like a smart remark, eyebrows arched
Thick lips, blond wig, nice tits, ass the size that I dig
Asked her the name, one way to approach her
See she had game, she needed me to coach her
Expose her to some paper, freedom and culture
The way a righteous pimp is supposed to

As he came closer in his eyes I seen fortune
I ain't having it like abortion
Walking with this stick holding his tip
Looked like a Black Panther that was trying to pimp
It was cold as shit, I'm waitin on my ride
Act like I didn't see him I tried

Motion denied
I felt the vibe like Roy Ayers
She was used to seeing pimps in furs and gators
Told her I'm an innovator, a gentlemen of leisure
That's in tuned with nature, hold Common's hand

You too slow for me

You know why?
I'm thinking bigger than Bagets
Birds in slick cars
Or have you on the corner trickin in strip bars
If you become mine the world would be ours
Respect the game, and universal laws

What, I oughta pimp slap your ass and make you fall against the wall
(try it)
Why you in the game if you ain't even trying to ball
I know pimpin ain't easy but damn you barely surviving
We can't ride together cause you ain't driving
(oh it's like that)

Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers
Customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god
Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers
Customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god

(this, this, this really how I look at it check it)
You and I together is like Ashford and Simpson
Picture us elbow to elbow at the hustler's convention

Think I'm gone risk my ass then give you the cash (yep)
That shit is the past
I got my own stable (where at)
I oughta pierce your navel and put you on the track
Matter of fact I been looking for a ho that's abstract

Girl you getting beside yourself
I'm trying to guide you
Help you see inside yourself
I pimp with vision, I'm a help you see the light
Have you covering your body and have you eating right

(Is that right)
I'm pimp ho's, pimp pens, (Say what)
Pimp rhythms, pimp flows
Pimp men (and pimp what)
Pimp systems
Got stores called big pimpin (Where)
Down South
In Texas I ran the best ho house

(So)
I pimp from Brazil to um, Tokyo
Have Japanese broads sayin Choushi wa dou (Yea right)
Bring'em back to the states to turn dates from Europe
Made the dirtiest of hoes seem purer

(Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)
(Why you laughin)
I'm laughin cause you funny
I'm make bitch niggas like you have my money
I get six hundred off yo' skinny ass weekly
You'll get all them righteous hoes in that dashiki

Yo, what ever happened to loyalty
Don't you want to become royalty
On the streets selling ass and oils for me
But you on this ho-asis and really I can't reach you
Fuck you then I'm about to be a preacher

Well there you have it ya'll
The story of pimps and hoes ya'll know how it goes
It's been the oldest profession
The whole thing is like a lesson
Ain't no second guessin
Pimps ya'll, hustlers
All that good shit

As a shorty I was always into sports
Now I talk to drums and walk in slums and thoughts that's oh
Instinct to hustle-divided by the struggle
Plus a couple of scuffle's and up to high shuffle
Even when it sound muffled,
I bust through, narrow gates,
With king-sized thoughts that's sparrow shaped
Before I came up I had to elevate
Let a nigga move where he want to move up to
You don't like how I'm living, well fuck oh

Know I love my baby, my baby loves me
Laying in some heaven, need a little company
Let's go into a heaven, time to get some geto heaven
Geto

Searching for a love, throughout the ghetto
Young girls is thick, righteousness is narrow
I got my third, I want the sparrow
Want my peoples straight and rock sweet apparel
The mother of my child, we not together
Baby it's your back, I got forever
As the weather, talks to us
Him rocking the holy spirit walks through us
The blunted eyes of the youth search for a guide
A thug is a lost man in disguise
The rise and fall, of a nation, even when the buildings tumble
I still stand tall, I walk through the valley, wit a life preserver
Feeling at times, that I might just murder
Yo but that ain't what I was sent for
I want folks to say his life it meant more
Than ""any ca, any ba ca"" any broad
He found geto heaven in himself and god

Geto heaven
Standing in some geto heaven
Geto heaven
Standing in some geto heaven

Love, your happiness don't begin wit a man
Strong woman, why should you depend on a man
I understand you want a man that's resourceful
If he pay your bills, he feel like he bought you
Talking to a friend, about what love is
Her man didn't love her, cause he didn't love his
Hugged her from afar, said what I felt
You never find a man, till you find yourself
Time helps mistakes, you can learn from
Cause one man fucked up men you shouldn't turn from
You want a certain type of guy, gotta reach a certain point too
At the destination, a king will anoint you
Going through the storm, many bodies stay warm
That relationship died, for you to be born, you worth more
Than anything you could cop in a store
For you to grow he had to go so what you stopping him for
Not even I could ignore being alone it's hard
Find heaven in yourself and god

I know I love my baby
My baby loves me
I'm laying in some heaven, need a little company, yeah
It's twenty four seven, time to get some geto heaven
Time to get some geto heaven
Geto heaven, geto heaven
It's time to get some geto heaven
Time to get some geto heaven, oh

This music is so much bigger than me
As far as happy, yo it's like a trigger to me
Dealing with crab rappers, and groupie broads
Record execs, at times it do be hard
But to choose words, and be heard across waters
Doing something you like to support daughters
Keeping your guys who collecting court orders
Conveying messages that the ancestors brought us
Thought of things to say to become the end thing for the day
Somehow, that didn't seem the way for me to make it
Music is a gift that is sacred
I hope you didn't use it hoping you could grow to it
Whether serving or a surgeon, you goin' go through it
Can't imagine going through it, without soul music
It's like donnie hath' helped me see lonnie's path
On my behalf, let's take whole steps to imhotep
And show depth, as we make people nod
Find heaven in this music and god

Messenger in the Metropolis; +Apocalypse+ here and +Now+
Niggas know the ledge, so they don't come near the style
I appear in clouds on some heaven to earth shit
Fake niggas drown the deeper the verse gets
Deep as a skinny girl's cunt, I surface with the purpose
To let y'all niggas know the demo
Voice is a instrument that's monumental
You couldn't fuck with the style if you was a nympho
Raised in the temple of Chi, taught to look into the eye
I identify with dobbs and weaves, and niggas making moves
That bob and weave, and niggas with jobs on the side sell weed
I feed off the hunger that a bum or abandoned child gets
Freaky, like Marv Albert, in outfits, by Chaka Givens
I lecture how I got God but don't got religion
Got a clip for these niggas on the net, selling my shit
Let's just say you Ramone and I'm Spit
In a habitat of Cadillacs and battle raps
And people that travel at the speed of need
Never agree with the ways of the world
Cats say anything, like they say to they girl
How you bringing it when you sit Indian style?
Niggas know me as Com it's time hear me go wild

Experiment in rooms on some bare bitch project

Like a dread with a white girl
You want me to cipher with you and the Gods?
I just did a show, I'm pursuing these broads
Everyone I ain't trying to fuck
Want to feel female presence and conversation a touch
You'll get split like a date that's dutch scuffed and scraped up
Taped up for trying to say what, ever you was about to say
You rap like a nigga that's about to spray
Get a mouth shot, for opening your mouth to say
Feel my heat in the night, it leaves you without the day
What I write is a passage for niggas to travel through
Before defeating me, Joe, you better battle you
I tap into my own zone like it's my home phone
Turn the cell off and let my dome roam
Shame I gotta do white labels to keep my life stable
I write fatal bringing niggas to life
A wise man came in the thick of the night
He said bring that shit when you pick up the mic
I said, ""What shit?""
He said hot shit, hot shit, hot shit

Common,"I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this
Gotta be something for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault em cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light but they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matching shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I want to be the one to make you happiest and hurt you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close
To the most, high
Regardless of what happen on him let's rely

There are times, when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light, that shines
Special for you, and me

Yo, yo, check it
It's important, we communicate
And tune the fate of this union, to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understanding and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call
So I pray every day more than anything
Friends will stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family, love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

There are times, when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light, that shines
Special for you, and me

Yeah yo, yo, check it
It's kind of fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you shit pop when it's time to, thinking you fresh
Suggesting beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard trying to practice abstinence
The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal
It's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'mma lead you
And whatever's right, I'mma feed you
Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da
Yo I tell you the rest when I see you, peace

There are times, when you'll need someone
I will be by your side

Who request hot shit, I freeze
And tell them where I was rose, we always said cold
Hold your horses and your carriages
This never-went-gold nigga rocks shows care-less
You not gon' respect self, at least respect the heritage
Affecting lives is where the wealth and the merit is
I realize what I portray day to day, I gotta carry this
And beats, rhymes and life is where the marriage is

You couldn't hang if you was a poster
Posing like a bitch for exposure
It's rumors of gay emcees, just don't come around me with it
You still rockin hickies, don't let me find out he did it
Got my eyes on the tiger, eyes on the prize
Eyes on the thighs, of Mary J. Blige
Imagining how good the cat must be
Stop eatin meat, lost weight, but I still rap husky
My verse depth, is that of a baby's first step
Or the old lady who died and the nurse wept
I flow like cursive writing, inviting you and yours to my openess
Shows allow me to cop range like a vocalist
But man does not live on bread alone
What good is a range when it's time to head home?

Now see you done messed with the wrong old lady
You done went wild, yo, check it

There was a Hardy Boy mystery I tried to solve again
Dude that broke in my crib, it wasn't involving him
Four in the morning, my phone ringing
I'm thinking, ""Who the fuck is this,"" on the other line screaming
Told em, ""Keep down,"" but they was breathing hard
It was my grandmother telling me that she had been robbed
I told her hold (hold) tight (tight), I'd be right over
Freezing but this situation made the night colder
Knew this was the night (that what?) that she played poker
With some friends in a club at the boat getting bub'
Said she seen these thugs on the boat for a while
Not gambling but every now and then they'd smile
Then blow! They had Mag's
And told everybody, ""Put your shit in the bag""
Made people strip naked, quicker than a Luke record (what?)
Had the place took in a minute and some seconds
Asked her how many of it was em? (How many of it was em?)
Said she couldn't remember
She was spooked and buzzing, couldn't describe em
Cause it happened too fast (what?) said they looked like me
With they pants hanging off they ass
Got her some water, and begin to think
How these niggas take her wig, her bracelet and her mink?
Somebody round the crib know the deal
Whoever did it better have Blue Shield for real
Cause yo, it's the big payback

Later that day I went to the 'shop, to see what was up
Them niggas probably knew something plus I needed a cut
Walked in they was playing Jigga
Discussing how Da Brat titties done got bigger
These niggas next to me, was talking bout the heist
Whoever did it even got Jordan for his ice
Said that it was done so precise the cops ain't know nothing
Had to use all my might not to ask no questions
Put down the magazine, went to the pop machine
Noticing these cats, had the Bling Bling
They wouldn't be talking if they did it, it could be they team
A week ago neither one of these niggas had a ring
This Hype came in, selling CD's, said the BD's
Was bragging bout robbery they had done
By now, I'm thinking bout my gun if I see gramps bracelet
I'ma play racist (and what?) and make niggas run
It's the big payback

My imagination roamed as I got in the chair
Thinking when shit went down, I was I was there
Fucking with fam' who you are, I don't care
Have your guys pouring liquor witch'ya name in they swear
These chicks claim they was there, knew the niggas who done it
Said it was Smoke and them from the Wild 100's
Eight million stories got me running in place, it's getting tricky
(like who?) like dude, that do drum'n'bass
There was a air in the place, that made me suspicious
Normally, they'd be talkin like bitches
My barber cut me with a quickness (what?)
Asked him where he got the new bracelet
He said it was his sister's, I knew then
What made it official, he gave me my change
The money clip had gramp's initials (c'mon)
As I, whooped his ass up, six niggas masked up
Pulled up in a Cadillac truck

Yeah, this is Pops, and I'm back in the studio
And I didn't have to break in this time
I'm back as a special guest by special request
And I want to thank my son for loaning me this microphone once again
They may have to wrestle to get it back
You know, as a result of my son Common touring the world
Pops has acquired a wonderful extended family
From around the globe
He has returned with positive messages to my earlobes
From all my children From Mexico, Brazil, Italy, Japan
And of course in the motherland
Even in the orient, they know what I meant
Nanaan, tanaan, tinaan, hanchinaan
So I didn't come in here to give any shouts out
I came to give praise and honor and to identify my children
Who've been saying and doing the right things
You know they sat on those nines of 1999
And kept them from turning upside down
And teaching the babies
To love, to be able to give love
And to enter the new century with their own prophecy
The century of amends
You see I deal with the premise that all children are ours
And that we all travel the same path
It's just that we don't get there at the same time
(See you next lifetime) See you next lifetime
And to my children running around here
Talking about how nice is they ice
That they've already paid for twice
What karat is they gold
That was yours before you were done in the hole
Or that crew from 1629, buy some land
Think agriculture; beat that neighborhood

Cause to never say never you done said never twice

If I had I.D. I wouldn't need I.D.

Why did Dr. J shave his beard and mustache

Common,"In the Spirit of God
In the Spirit of the Ancestors
In the Spirit of the Black Panthers
In the Spirit of Assata Shakur
We make this movement towards freedom
For all those who have been oppressed, and all those in the struggle
Yeah, yo, check it

There were lights and sirens, gunshots firing
Cover your eyes as I describe a scene so violent
Seemed like a bad dream, she laid in a blood puddle
Blood bubbled in her chest, cold air brushed against open flesh
No room to rest, pain consumed each breath
Shot twice wit her hands up
Police questioned but shot before she answered
One Panther lost his life, the other ran for his
Scandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her
Comprehension she was beyond, tryin' to hold on
To life. She thought she'd live with no arm
That's what it felt like, got to the hospital, eyes held tight
They moved her room to room-she could tell by the light
Handcuffed tight to the bed, through her skin it bit
Put guns to her head, every word she got hit
""Who shot the trooper?"" they asked her
Put mace in her eyes, threatened to blast her
Her mind raced till things got still
Opened her eyes, realized she's next to her best friend who got killed
She got chills, they told her, that's where she would be next
Hurt mixed wit anger-survival was a reflex
They lied and denied visits from her lawyer
But she was building as they tried to destroy her
If it wasn't for this German nurse they would of served her worse
I read this sister's story, knew that it deserved a verse
I wonder what would happen if that would of been me?
All this shit so we could be free, so dig it, y'all

I'm thinkin' of Assata, yes
Listen to my Love, Assata, yes
Your Power and Pride is beautiful
May God bless your Soul

It seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her
Walkie-talkies crackling, I see 'em when they taking her
Though she kinda knew,
What made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue
Arrived to Middle-sex Prison about six inna morning
Uneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in
A cell, one cot, no window, facing hell.
Put in the basement of a prison wit all males
And the smell of misery, seat-less toilets and centipedes
She'd exercise, (paint?,) and begin to read
Two years in a hole. Her soul grew weak
Away from people so long she forgot how to speak
She discovered freedom is a unspoken sound
And a wall is a wall and can be broken down
Found peace in the Panthers she went on trial with
One of the brothers she had a child with
The foulness they would feed her, hopin she's lose her seed
Held tight, knowing the fight would live through this seed
In need of a doctor, from her stomach she's bleed
Out of this situation a girl was conceived
Separated from her, left to mother the Revolution
And lactated to attack hate
Cause federal and state was built for a Black fate
Her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates
They fabricated cases, hoping one would stick
And said she robbed places that didn't exist
In the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites
Through dark halls of hate she carried the light
I wonder what would happen if that would of been me?
All of this shit so we could be free.
Yeah, I often wonder what would happen if that would f been me?
All of this shit so we could be free, so dig it, people

I'm thinkin' of Assata, yes
Listen to my Love, Assata, yes
Your Power and Pride is beautiful
May God bless your Soul

Yo
From North Carolina her grandmother would bring
News that she had had a dream
Her dreams always meant what they needed them to mean
What made them real was the action in between
She dreamt that Assata was free in they old house in Queens
The fact that they always came true was the thing
Assata had been convicted of a murder she couldna done
Medical evidence shown she couldna shot the gun
It's time for her to see the sun from the other side
Time for her daughter to be by her mother's side
Time for this Beautiful Woman to become soft again
Time for her to breathe, and not be told how or when
She untangled the chains and escaped the pain
How she broke out of prison I could never explain
And even to this day they try to get to her
But she's free with political asylum in Cuba.

I'm thinkin' of Assata, yeah
Listen to my Love, Assata, yeah
We're molded from the same mud, Assata
We share the same Blood, Assata, yeah
Your power and pride, so beautiful
May God bless your soul
Your power and pride, so beautiful
May God bless your soul

Freedom! You askin' me about freedom
Asking me about freedom?
I'll be honest with you
I know a whole more about what freedom isn't
Than about what it is, cause I've never been free
I can only share my vision with you of the future
About what freedom is
Uh, the way I see it
Freedom is, is the right to grow, is the right to blossom
Freedom is is the right to be yourself, to be who you are
To be who you want to be, to do what you want to do",A Song for Assata
Common,"Ha, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, play at your own risk
Act like you know bitch I'm on some grown shit
Ha, yeah, yeah, play at your own risk
Act like you know bitch I'm on some grown shit
It's the Thelonious, super microphonist
You know us, this rap shit we 'bout to own it
You know it, these Mini-Me's trying to clone us
I got a bonus for the bitch that run up on us
I got a bonus for your bitch that run up on us
It's the Thelonious, super microphonist

Uhh, no time to sleep cause if you sleep you don't eat
Gotta hold heat, just to make ends meet
Niggas living on the street while other niggas feast
Alright wit you it ain't alright wit me
Right, gotta make money all my life
Gotta stay fucking bitches many types
Yeah you know what I'm talking 'bout
Yup, stay turning these bitches out
Dick em down also dick em out
Throw something down whenever my dick's out
They know me so they restructure and reroute
They know me from Washington to down south
All the way to London to my nigga Common house
Right, it's like a game we never play out, out, out, out

Nigga no doubt, nigga get live or get knocked the fuck out
Word up, just be about what you about dog
Know what I'm saying, just play at your own risk
Act like you know bitch I'm on some grown shit
It's the Thelonious, super microphonist
You know us, this rap shit we 'bout to own it
You know it, cause you can feel it in your throat
Say it

I'm 'bout to let my mind float
(Com, say it)
Get your third eye poked
Fuck game, I assemble dope,
Ness, a nigga that's fresh as the 'fess
Studied this rap shit, no need to mic test
You can feel it in your chest
Your B I, feel it in her breasts
Plus you, rhyme like a nigga wit his nipples pierced
We lick off lyrics in the streets and real niggas hear us
Dreaming when I wrote this, box me if I go too wild
Still doing this shit like dude in wild style
Inviting wack niggas to dinner
I ""Trick Daddy"" emcees and I don't know, ""Nann Nigga""
Who can take it where I take it
You better going to God like Mase did
Leaving crowds complacent
I move em above clouds whether on some surf and turf shit
Or thug style you can feel it in your body
Yeah y'all you can feel it in your body

Like if a 12 gauge shottie shell hit your body
You don't want no one to find your ass a hobby
Carbon copy, niggas trying to clone us
You know us, Thelonious, super microphone
You know this, rap shit we 'bout to own it dun, for real

Hey, it's like a ritual
You been invited let the mortal body stimulate the place
With the grace, nevertheless, I stress
Let the music put a smile on your face
As for the ritual, when it comes to spiritual excellence
You know I always leave you with the taste
I know you like it hard to the core
That's what you ask for, you aching for the best
Hurting like a sore in that ass, like a ritual
Conversation with the most high makes me wanna cry
I wonder why, you wanna get to paradise
But that itty bitty part of you don't wanna die
So pay attention to my word, cause it's the truth
Meditation ease the mind, and brings the youth
It's like a verse you could never read out of a book
Dropping the line in your mind like a fish hook
Word is birth, yo I do it till the break of day
Pay attention to your art, never go astray
Word is bond

Yo we do it and we don't quit
Sucker nigga you don't want it, it's Thelonious
Owning this rap shit, super microphonist, and we known to spit
I spit fire like Esther on Sanford and Son did
I'm raw dude, more juice than Sunkiss
You want this, so MJ kept saying the rhyme flawless
Shit fly like MJ in his prime, ""Off The Wall"" wit mines
I'm grabbing my balls when I rhyme, nine nines busting plus
Ball all the time, now stay on your mind like great sex
You ain't on my mind I'm thinking 'bout paychecks
Niggas large like an Adex Avirex jacket
Yo the gods they bust like latex sex packets
Emcees they don't rhyme and ball, they lyin' to y'all
They dyin' to ball, the rhyme we do all the time
We do all the fine bitches they fall in lines
Me and my mans is something like the Source Sports
We gettin money a long time and y'all short
My niggas bounce and full rise and y'alls fall
You funny doo, cause really you think you can do me
When you roll a 500 that's really a 320
Should of let somebody else hook it
Numbers look crooked like King Kong shook it
I'm from where niggas bang gats when they celebrate
That's how they play, don't let it be a holiday
Thelonious niggas, if you testing us we get you laid back
Show you the definition of a pay back",Thelonius

Yo what's happening?

Take this back and then, tell a friend
Spaces and places you been, time travelin
Time travelin

Yo, I was a piano player in my last lifetime
Now I write rhymes, sip white wine and let my light shine
Out the dark space, with the world on my mind like Scarface
Though my sex drive like a car chase
More than a uhh, it's the piece of mind I chase
Stakes are high, like my uncle is
We both got problems, he never confronted his
Under the bridge I wrote, some shit to stay afloat
And paint a picture, raw like the first coat
Send my old man a note to keep his phone on
My little cuz'll know cheap tricks are homegrown
Travel to a place sweeter than home, listenin to Nina Simone
Repeat this psalm, to the sky I'm keepin my palms
Facin the east, actions macin the beast
Embracin the streets, my guy caught a case cuz he beat
His lady down, it's two-thou
That ain't the way we lay it down
Souls get, found and lost at the roads they cross
Many paid dues, but few knew the costs
I ran through the Moss like Randy
Touching down with God, close friends, and family
Recognize the voice in the wilderness
Com Sense, '92 and I'm still in this

Time travelin, took my time in hand
My rhyme learn and plan
Jealousy, money and pride can burn a man
Some walk but never learn to stand
Still, afraid to expand what they feel
I'm dealin wit, wakes, marriages
ATM's, Ericsson's
Loud niggas that whisper carelessness
If we livin in Revelation
Why should the people of the sun have to run?
Come to Esau in a year, he'll have freedom
He ask why I hadn't been to see him
Really, I ain't have a good reason
He said, ""Rah, give back what you receivin""
In a race against time, I was caught
In the same game as you, but long live the sport
It's time travelin
It's the C-double-O and I'm back again
Take this back and then, tell a friend
Spaces and places you been

Nigga deep in the rhythm, experience speak
Some keepin' the wisdom, the life hustlers seek
I seeking it with em, i'm dope the streets need me to hit em
With some of that (revolutionary rap)
Revolutionary blunted rap
My peoples want hits, I hit it from the back
Under the cherry moon, I hold notes and carry tunes
My guise pack heat enough to bury June, on my feet
I'm getting married soon, walking in the clouds like Mary Bethune
Fumes of a real nigga seep into your room
Or through fifteens of the your jeep that you boom
Son so many cats, they call me high noon
Offerings to Osun hoping war is over soon
Guard your grill like George Foreman
Time to build, as far as building I'm the doorman, opening doors
My blood I expose on the floors, tell them the game ain't only the score
Hold on to your life as I carry these styles
To have you tapping your head like Darius Miles
You ain't supposed to rhyme, better off with a clothing line
In this business of pimps, many hoes get signed
Opposed to shine so me holding the blinds
Mixing golden seal and wine, holding a nine
In the age of Aquarius

The water that arrives (ba-ba ba ba)
To purify the world (du-ba ba ba)
Flying through the night (du ba-ba ba ba)
So watch out here he comes ( do-do ba ba ba)
Aquarius!

Between churches and liquor stores, my mic leaks
With raps, all over your head like Tweet
Playing with yourself, thinking the game is just wealth
Hot for a minute, watch your name just melt
Same spot where it's joyous, where the pain is felt
As you build and destroy yo remain yourself
They say I'm slept on, now I'm bucking in dreams
And rhyme with the mind of a hustler scheme
Or the struggle of fiends, I flow over water that's as troubled as teens
For the love of the team, trying to double the dream
Be grateful like the church psalm my grandmother sings
I'm rubbing my rings across the domes of clones
Punchlines like Roy Jones with poems
While you and your dogs foam at the mouth
Thinking rap is the only way out
The black human genius will never play out
I take you way out, where you never been before
Been it since birth, sent to replish the Eatrh
That truck that you roll is like a miniature hearse
I deaded your shit before you finished a verse
From niggas to gods from bitches to earths
From Nat to Truck Turner that lives in my verse
Realness is an act that you cannot rehearse
Holla back, but listen first
We in the age of Aquarius

The water that arrives (ba-ba ba ba)
To purify the world (du-ba ba ba)
Flying through the night (du ba-ba ba ba)
So watch out here he comes ( do-do ba ba ba)
Aquarius!

Common,"She rested her head upon my chest
Sensed liberation in between breaths
Wonder if sex is what she found it in
Peace, found it laying down with men
Wasn't there to judge her, many ways I loved her
It was more than bodies we shared with each other
We laid under the cover of friends
A place where many lovers began
I began, to feel her body shake in my hand
Body language, it's so hard trying to understand
Usually after sex, it's a good feel
Took by silence, emotion stood still
I could feel, her tears spill, from her grille
Hurt from before that began to build
She told me hold me, a story she assembled it
Telling it, trying not to remember it
It was a story of innocence taken
Thought she could redeem, through love making
When she was eight she was raped by her father
And tried to escape through multiple sex partners
Felt pitiful, she had only learned,
To love through the physical, inside it burned
My heart turned, I thought of what this man did
She forgave him, she grew to understand it
Her soul was tired and never really rested
Only with men through aggression
Said it was a blessing and it happened for a reason
By speaking it, she found freedom
Between me and you

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Sometimes I wish a, careless whisper
Serenade her, without speaking a word
Because of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer
I feel so alive in me, you have liberated me

She laid, I watched her breathe
Happy to be here, not afraid to leave
I couldn't conceive her not being here
Death in her face her not having fear
Less than a year she was diagnosed with it
Memories of that year, so close and vivid
Happiness, would only visit, once in a while
To watch an adult, becoming a child
Somehow, I knew she'd make it
The life of one so given early would God take it?
Hurt she placed in, hope and prayer
Hurt she placed in chemo and lost hair
I stare with my eyes closed
Wonder when the body leave does the mind go
Watching Jordan became less important
Seeing this disease eat away my aunt's organs
According to doctors there's no cure
We went through doubt, and cases of insure
Wish I knew then how to heal with herbs
Knew a part of her I could heal with words
But the Creator was sending for her
What seemed like the end was the beginning for her
Like that, she didn't want us to remember her
No more medication did she want us to give to her
It spread from her liver to her lungs to her last breath
Only to be freed through death
Between me and you 
[Chorus]

He spoke with his eyes, tear-filled
A lump in his throat, his fear built
My whole life it was in steel
This ain't the way that men feel
A feeling, he said he wish he could kill
A feeling, not even time could heal
This is how real life's supposed to be?
For it to happen to someone close to me?
So far we'd come, for him to tell me
As he did, insecurity held me
I felt like he failed me
To the spirit, yelled help me
I'd known him for like what seemed forever
About going pro we dreamed together
Never knew it would turn out like this
For so long he tried to fight this
Now there was no way for him to ignore it
His parents found out and hated him for it
How could I judge him? Had to accept him if I truly loved him
No longer he said had he hated himself
Through sexuality he liberated himself
Between me and you 

[Chorus]

Liberation
Peace","Between Me, You and Liberation"
Common,"It's just a fly love song, what

Are we living in a dream world?
Are your eyes still green girl?
I know your sick and tired of arguing
But you can't keep it bottled in
Jealousy, we got to swallow it
Your heart and mind baby follow it
Smile, happiness you could model it
And when you feel opposite
I just want you to know
Your whole being is beautiful
I'm going to do the best I can do
Cause I'm the best when I'm with you

Come close to me baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy
What's it without you

Put down your bags love
I know in the past love
Has been sort of hard in you
But I see the God in you
I just want to nurture it
Though this love may hurt a bit
We dealing wit this water love
You even give my daughter love
I want to build a tribe wit you
Protect and provide for you
Truth is I can't hide from you
The pimp in me
May have to die with you

Come close to me baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy

I know what you're thinking, you're on my mind
You're right, you're right, you're right
You promise so fast you just might take flight
Hope your not tired, tonight, tonight

You help me to discovery me
I just want you to put trust in me
I kind of laugh when you cuss at me
The aftermath is you touching me
It's destiny to we connected girl
You and I we can affect the world
I'm tired of the fast lane
I want you to have my last name

Come close to me baby

Common,"Phone rang, screen said caller ID said blocked
But for some reason I decided to answer it
On the other end was a French accent
He told me we needed to rap quick
Cause he had did some bad shit
And would be gone for years, spending these last two days
With his momma and his kids
When he spoke I wasn't trying to hear it ,cause
I knew he was a real good person
And this didn't seem like it was in his spirit
He couldn't believe as much as I couldn't, what he done
He said now its time for him to turn himself in
No longer could he run, from life, from God
Start thinkin', why is doing right is so hard
I got back to him when we was in London discussin' the new testament
And how our lives related to it, and how we could make the best of it
My voice became destined, so I asked him why you gotta go
He said you know turn to Matthew twenty-four
He said no one knows the hour, nor do they know the day
But the kingdom is near, don't let anything lead you to stray
As long as God is with you, everything will be okay
So right about then, we decided to pray

Just lyin' back makin' the smoke disperse a ray
Deep into clouds
It's makin' things appear to me so clearly
Deep in the clouds
Just lyin' back makin' the smoke disperse a ray
Deep in the clouds
It's makin' things appear to me so clearly
Deep into clouds

Your time
Is a terrible to waste
For it's
Not one of the possessions that you can bring to space, yeah, it don't matter
Its a challenge
But the chance of seeing, is quite a dream to chase, yes it is
I hope
I remind God of him when he sees my face
He goin' see it

The feeling just keeps on lifting me higher
And its ever flowing it's, ever flowing
When every thing, puts a smile on my face
And I recognize the strong goal
But I keep on going, I keep on going
I keep on going on

Hey mighty love
Watching over me
A smile, brilliant
All over, constantly
Warm, comforting
Perfect, like nothing
No hate, no confusion, no strain
Simply peace, simply
Simply, simply, simply

No fear! Heaven is to me
No fear of destruction
Understanding who he is
His name is Christ
Heaven, heaven is to me
Wisdom, understanding, knowledge

Streets of gold and pearly gates
Halos wings all dressed in white
Angels sing and cymbals glare
No one's rich no one's poor
People dreaming they live free
Making love while they in love
Wonderful dream wake me when you're home

Heaven, heaven is being pops
Heaven is spending the day with your grandchildren
Listenin' to they voices when and they laughing and play
And then at the end of the day we hug we kiss and slowly they walk away
And then suddenly they turn and rush back to me and hug me round the knees
Yeah, that's heaven to me",Heaven Somewhere

My eyes watch God from a place
Where times is hard, hard times we embrace
Everybody want a yard, cuz a yard means space
Being broke is odd and leaves an odd taste
In the mouth of the metropolitan
The hustle is hollarin'
Beautiful minds grind, grind for the dollarin'
Whether dice scholarin' or white collarin'
We all taught hustle to prophet like Solomon
The young play corners, Sean Jean modelin'
They get it from they momma, black music is fatherin'
Blue and whites flash lights like parliment
In court non-whites, wishin' they had Cocharan
Tell your guy and them, yo the blocks hot again

Married a foreign chick so she could get a green card up in the hustle

To get in them ghetto streets and get him a ghetto toys
So he can come so just work murder rate is increasin'
I don't give a fuck long as my coke is decent
And my rims blind the whole damn precinct
Every time you see a head in my lap you know she sinked
I know I'm dead in this trap, that's not how we think
Fifty shells all around on the ground, can't catch a weak blink
Five went through me, two stayed in me to do my duty
Only thing that subdued me

Common,"Candy sweet, your words of bedtime
I was just saying to myself the other day
Most don't believe in the magician, but you're bewitching
Because of this I must say
I, I, I appreciate what you give to me, yeah
I, I appreciate what you give to me, yeah

People say I got soul, look at all the records I hold
The lives I've affected, connect and control
With me in your basement your mama got blown
I provide the vibe to keep the strippers on poles
Through me the black experience is glorious told
From a school that's old, bold, so I rock gold
And platinum, some cats I hold notes and cash for them
On streets I rap with them, in ghettos I blast for them
Mash with them, at the party and all
Be the universal language that's embodying all
Put the Billie Holiday, Bob Marley in y'all
Y'all feel most high when I be in y'all
System, with the rhythm I up jump the boogie
Shame I rely on record labels to push me
Since the bush, I been y'all way to escape
Through eight-tracks, wax, CD's and tapes
I am music

Candy sweet, your words of bedtime
I was just saying to myself the other day
Most don't believe in the magician, but you're bewitching
Because of this I must say
I, I, I appreciate what you give to me, yeah
I, I appreciate what you give to me, yeah

You can feel me all over alive, I help culture survive, I opened the eyes of many
Styles y'all wrote in the skies, with your lows and highs, open your mind to hear me
In the streets I beat cops and obsolete
On every station it's hot, you can't stop my heat
I taught Jay and Dre how to rock the beat
On what's going on today, yo, I gots to speak
I take the stand, yo, you could feel me bam
Whether in Larry Graham or Steely Dan
Live I be killing it man
For how long I survived yo I'm realer than man
Got a soft side but I'm still a man
For me women cry and children dance, I'm trying to eat
I could'a got a mil and ran
But like Sly for the fam still I stand
I am music

Candy sweet, your words of bedtime
I was just saying to myself the other day
Most don't believe in the magician, but you're bewitching
Because of this I must say
I, I, I appreciate what you give to me, yeah
I, I appreciate what you give to me, yeah

I been here since the beginning
Beginning of time, yo, beginning of time
Deep in the mind of the ancient ones
Everybody love me like they do the sun
I shine at times, yo, at times I'm dark
You can't categorize me, my mind's a art
Inside my heart, it ain't about climbing charts
I'm the one you roll with when you're riding smart
The change that came, the change that comes
I change with chords and I kick it with drums
Get blow with horns and did it on the one
Riffed for guitars, for the Lord I sung
Spun around the world at parties and weddings
Wherever I go, I create the setting
You know me from lessons or your pop's collection
Whether whole or half stepping, I'm a blessing
Yo, I am music

Candy sweet, your words of bedtime
I was just saying to myself the other day
Most don't believe in the magician, but you're bewitching

Common,"Yeah! Ha! Yeah, we got, come on
Why y'all cats know the abstract nigga with the attitude
Pass the booze, and let's build on it
I'm rolling in a Cadillac with the grill fronted
I ain't even smoke no mo' but I feel blunted
Yo I'm toking on the freedom
Stepping to the A.M., cats be taking in the P.M.
Tell the players I'm the G.M.
Told my team let me get my plays straight, I'ma feed them
They need me like I need them
See the streets is bleeding
Had to meet with my mind on how I could divined
Stay on my climb
I'm grinding, 'til I get blue balls
Everyday, same shit new star
Don't make me act like where I come from because he grew tall
There's a place that to run from it if you neutral
Hustlers and vogues, customers and smokes
I kiss the sky feeling high off the stuff that I wrote

I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high

Keep my head high, let the chrome spin

I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high

I'm the only cat in hip hop that can go into a thrift shop
Connect, get up to the ghetto and get props
If you gonna get that kick-a-box
Make sure that bitch knock
If you gonna get that glock don't be scared to big shot
Hip Hop is changing, why y'all want me to stay the same?
Sorta like Barkley on how I see the game
I recognize game like a scout
Hey yo, I'm bound to wreck your lady as I turn your lady out
I ain't about that
Messing with no other man's women
Because of jealousy then a man go under
Understand a man and his mental
Listening to Joan Mitchell
With the fan and the window
Can it be so simple then?
I rock Rockports, you rock Timberland's
I want a Rover, but I'm thinking long range
I ain't switch over, I just made my own lane

I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high

I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high

Like a pimp to a hoe I connect to the track
I feel it in my neck and my back
A thug came to me, said it changed his life
Said the love of his life, he used to bang to the light
I'm trying to do better
I ain't claiming Mister Right
I'm a grown man, I'm too old to fist-fight
I stay on point like trick dice
Tweaking like the sound man who need to switch mike
Sounding bitch like
I know the block is hot, but we just can't get ice
When our children's children sit nice?
I sing the song to make the fiend's strong
King Kong ain't got shit on me
I train days to rip emcees, I'm peaking
But I still gotta get that cheese
You on some monkey ball damn chimpanzees
Mobbing through the Chi-Town to feel the breeze yo

I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin

So high born to fly

Try things but few die so young
Something among Jimi was stung

[Verse 1: Common]
It's funk to rhythm and punk to rock
Loud like shot that come from a glock
Pick up your mind, run from the spot
Revolution jumping in the parking lot
Shit is so hot that the sun watch
Children by the window with the gun cocked
They could get robbed and stop the luck (?)
Monkeys dance around for MTV spots
I lock into a,
Rock into a rhythm of street and ancient wisdom
Experiment in stereo loud so crank the system
For the humble on the path I paint a vision
How far will a nigga go just for attention
And to be remembered, you forgot the mission
Listen!

[Verse 2: Common]
I lay terror in this era like Che Guevera
For the people to make or wait it's better
In a room called real I stay forever
Everyday I lose something I gain forever
Meditate on how I can change the weather
My brainstorm for some it's like umbrella
Where bullets and lies both spray together
My mind scream like Al Green ""Let's Stay Together""
How could a nigga be so scared of change
That's what you hustle for, for the currency exchange
Y'all rich, we could beef curry in the game
Out your mouth, ain't nobody hurrying my name
You seen what happened when the Com go bang
Wouldn't have a shot, even at a gun range
Seen hype become fame against the grain become main-stream
It all seems mundane in the scope of things

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Common]
From a land of shit talk, boy stars and pitch forks
Didn't really see white until I went North
Getting bent on backyards, wishing in the air for a black god
Where people fix cars and clap hard
And look to the stars for rap jobs
I walk through the black fog with reflectors on my boots
Smelling war near, I'm connected with the troops
That master anger and ain't afraid to shoot
Through poured liquor fallen angels they salute (Whew! Whew!)
Feel the wind blow
A new wave people with their hair trimmed low
It's two ways living in this world of techno
This age can't really save the ghetto
I pause for the rebels who rock heavy metals
And tell them that they're pharaoh so let go

Nigga breath can tell by how you rap you don't believe
Ain't hungry no mo' so off me you feed
I hustle at a speed between greed and need
On the streets where intuition and weed are breed
Shoot the gift and viff, at the myths uplift
My rhyme the clip its like the boom bip to tip(q)
In gangways where cats that rhyme the same way
Spending nites over Egypt to learn a brave day
Paint a picture of the ghetto like JJ
You the Ray J Of this rap world
I travel the globe with a black girl name Becky
Grand like Auto Theft 3
Style so developed the law can't arrest me
You walk with blood on your shirt
Like Jesse Jackson trying to test the reaction of the people
See through trying to out act Don Cheadle
I speak to original Hebrew s you know how we do
And bleed through the needle with truth
That needs no preview to proof its in the people
And how they react still in the business of smacking
Rappers is wack you had a dope track I guess opposites
attract my mind state is black
Black like bernie mack no cowards soul power in the words we rap

Picks with fist, thick grease, dark nipples
My guy buy ice I search for the dark crystal
Racing for paper these broads is starter pistols
I spit through gang wars and strange doors
Out the sky flames pour the beats claims war
I see niggaz with flags who they waving them for?
I'm the nigga that you put the chain on the door for
The nigga that you started changing the laws for
Orator of hard-core and more
My raps the portal for the blue collar
Than made a hit and came up on a few dollars
I'd rather listen to silence then you holla
Borrowed your persona from the late that made dear mama
My realness is my armor that I wear up in this boy
For truth your a decoy
Common Sense is like the future of the Bee-boy
I fall down and get up like Don McClerken
Hit puss and listen to it whistle while I'm trerkin
Break it down like herb
The nympho of info I'm fucking what you heard
You ain't ready for war your stuck in the reserves
I mastered my high so I'm bucking at the birds
I been wanted to fly so now I do it with the words
For those in the fast-lane I show you how to merge
Get your own you see its like home grown herb black economics
The people we serve with Soul Power",Soul Power
Common,"Let's do it now, it's me and you
Close my eyes Erotica, I'm seein' you
Listen to me wishin' I could be with you
To share my love and ecstasy with you
Are you alone? Is your shorty sleep?
Hold on. That's okay, ignore the beep
For you, my love is immortal deep
You are my queen but I can't ignore the freak
Let's let our bodies talk and our auras speak
Hold on, gotta get the toiletries
As our waters reach distances unheard of
I'm in the room nestled sweet and I observe love
Only for you, I ask God to show me the truth
What he showed me was you
Wherever I go, my soul leads to you
Days gone, nights lonely for you

Erotica, wet dreams are on my mind
Erotica, can I come in your mind?
Erotica, oh yes, our love must shine

Erotica-ca-ca

Wish on star 69, erotica

So much I wish you were here with me now
My bad, I just hit redial
I want you to come and never leave now
Is your mind and your right hand free now?
Our love-reach deep down inside of it
As the candle burns
Where desire's lit
Makin' love knows no distance or environment
When we (ahh), feel the most high in it
I feel you touchin' me and I begin to rise from it
Your love is stuck in me
Our minds are so alive and thick
Picture my hands on your waist
As I stare in your face
Your mouth half open
Your love I can taste
Embracin' you
Life, I let go
Gotta switch phones 'cause this one is ghetto
Another level of love we create when we take it to
And when it's made, Erotica, it's made for you

""Slave to your loneliness""
Inside of loneliness
""Inside this (alt we bear)""
With love of loneliness
""With thoughts of loneliness""

I want you to come
Inside your mind
And find a place
Nasty and kind
This is where
Our desires grind
And where they peak
Is most divine
A place and time
I hope we reach together
You are my queen
And freak forever

Some keepin' the wisdom, the life hustlers seek
I seeking it with em, I'm dope the streets need me to hit em
With some of that (revolutionary rap)
Revolutionary blunted rap
My peoples want hits, I hit it from the back
Under the cherry moon, I hold notes and carry tunes
My guise pack heat enough to bury June, on my feet
I'm getting married soon, walking in the clouds like Mary Bethune
Fumes of a real nigga seep into your room
Or through fifth teens of the your jeep that you boom
Son so many cats, they call me high noon
Offerings to Osun hoping war is over soon
Guard your grill like George Foreman
Time to build, as far as building I'm the doorman, opening doors
My blood I expose on the floors, tell them the game ain't only the score
Hold on to your life as I carry these styles
To have you tapping your head like Darius Miles
You ain't supposed to rhyme, better off with a clothing line
In this business of pimps, many hoes get signed
Opposed to shine so me holding the blinds
Mixing golden seal and wine, holding a nine
In the age of Aquarius

The water that arrives 
To purify the world 
Flying through the night 
So watch out here he comes 
Aquarius!

Between churches and liquor stores, my mic leaks
With raps, all over your head like Tweet
Playing with yourself, thinking the game is just wealth
Hot for a minute, watch your name just melt
Same spot where it's joyous, where the pain is felt
As you build and destroy yo remain yourself
They say I'm slept on, now I'm bucking in dreams
And rhyme with the mind of a hustler scheme
Or the struggle of fiends, I flow over water that's as troubled as teens
For the love of the team, trying to double the dream
Be grateful like the church psalm my grandmother sings
I'm rubbing my rings across the domes of clones
Punchlines like Roy Jones with poems
While you and your dogs foam at the mouth
Thinking rap is the only way out
The black human genius will never play out
I take you way out, where you never been before
Been it since birth, sent to replenish the Eatrh
That truck that you roll is like a miniature hearse
I deaded your shit before you finished a verse
From niggas to gods from bitches to earths
From Nat to Truck Turner that lives in my verse
Realness is an act that you cannot rehearse
Holla back, but listen first

I'm talkin' Malcolm, Coltrane, my man Yusef
Through death grew conception, new breath and resurrection
For moms, new steps in her direction, in the right way
Told inside is where the fight lay
And everything a nigga do may not be what he might say
Chicago nights stay, stay on the mind
But I write many lives and lay on these lines
Wave the signs of the times
Many say the grind's on the mind
Shorties blunted-eyed and everyone wonderin' where I'm
Bush pushing lies, killers immortalized
We got arms but won't reach for the skies
Waiting for the Lord to rise
I look into my daughter's eyes
And realize I'ma learn through her
The Messiah, might even return through her
If I'ma do it, I gotta change the world through her
Furs and a Benz, Gramps wantin 'em
Demons and old friends, Pops they hauntin' him
The chosen one from the land of the frozen sun
When drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones

This ain't '94 Joe we can't go back
The game need a makeover
My man retired, I'ma take over
Tell these halftime niggas break's over
I'm raw hustlers getcha bakin' soda
Too many rape the culture
Leave rappers with careers and their faith over
It's a war goin' on you can't fake bein' a soldier
In the basement listenin' to tapes of Ultramagnetic to the fact the Messiah's black
I turn the TV down we could take it higher than that
I wonder if these wack niggas realize they wack
And they the reason my people say they tired of rap
Inspired by black Muslims and Christian
Pushin' Cutlasses, dope, and other traditions
In the conditions of the city, the city,
Come on

And you say Chi city, we don't stop naw we don't quit

I tell 'em fuck 'em, like I do the police

I'm in between sheets tryna have sex that's tantric
But the getto, tryna make a get up stand up anthem
You spit hot garbage son of Sanford
What you rappin' for to get fame or get rich
I slap a nigga like you
And tell him Rick James bitch
Witcha Hollywood stories on porches
We poli hood stories on who became rich
And whatever light they hit, we wanna hit the same switch
You didn't know where to aim it, you still remain bitch

Some'll sever mothers from daughters and fathers from sons

Unless it's DMC or runnin' these broads to bein' free

Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
In their socks and their soles, niggas holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed, hoping for mo'
With nowhere to go, niggas rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way, cause they ain’t knowin' their goals
The streets ain’t safe cause they ain’t knowing the code
By the foes I was told, either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don’t roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove
On the corners

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

We overstated, we underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins and
Yellow and pink and profiles

Street lights and deep nights, cats trying to eat right
Riding no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes
So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right
Desires of street life, cars and weed types
It’s hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like
Game at its peak, we speak and believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
It’s steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like
Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like
G's with three strikes, seeds that need light
Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife
The corner, where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong ‘cause it’s hard to see right
Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light
Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites
The corner

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people
Black power
Black is beautiful

Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers
As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists
The dirt isn’t just fertile, it’s people working and earning this
The curb getters go where the cash flow and the current is
It’s so hot that niggas burn to live
The furnace is, where the money moving, the determined live
We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers
It’s so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge
Our Taj Mahal, our monument
Our testimonial to freedom, to peace, and to love
Down on the corner",The Corner

Yes, its for the people, God moves, yeah

I was rollin' around, in my mind it occurred
What if God was a her?
Would I treat her the same? Would I still be runnin' game on her?
In what type of ways would I want her?
Would I want her for her mind or her heavenly body?
Couldn't be out gettin' bogus with someone so godly
If I was wit' her would I still be wantin' my ex?
The lies, the greed, the weed, the sex
Wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check
Wearin' her cross, I mean the heart on my neck
Her I would reflect on the streets of the Chi'
Ride wit' her, 'cause I know for me she'd die
Through good and bad call on her like I'm chirpin' her
Couldn't be jealous 'cause other brothers worship her
Walk this earth for her, glory, I'm grateful
To be in her presence I try to stay faithful

Faithful to thee
Faithful to thee
Faithful to thee
I'd like to be her very best friend

He worked with her, she was his lady's best friend
Even if they don't try some ladies test men
And this was a test that was bigger than him
Some believe its the nature that is given to men
He had a good gig, a wife, a kid, a decent home
One reason or another couldn't find peace at home
She asked, ""Why do men always have to stray?""
He said, ""I'm bad, not as bad as Eric Benet""
""I used to take 'em out to eat but they wasn't really eatin'
Mighta got a little head but I wasn't really cheatin'""
It's hard when your lady don't believe what you say
And what you did in the past you gotta live with today
She asked if they could spend the night together
He thought, and said, ""I'm tryin' to get my life together""
Went home to his lady, these were his confessions
""Baby you a blessin' and my best friend""

Common,"I walked in the crib, got 2 kids
And my baby momma late (uh oh, uh oh, uh oh)
So I had to did what I had to did
Cause I had to give (dough, dough, dough)
I'm up all night gettin' my money right
Until the blue and whites (popo, popo, popo)
Now the money coming slow, but at least a nigga know
Slow motion better than (no-oh, no-oh, no-oh)

You love to hear the story, again and again
About these young brothers from the city of wind
Like juice and gin in the city we blend
Amongst the hustle, titties and skin, fifties and rims
Y'all know the spreewells
And trucks that's detailed,
Heartless females that want to ride in 'em
Felt the southside in them with raw hides and denim
Bent minds collide with them
A system that tries victims, we livin' in
My man in the fast lane pivotin'
On the block white is sellin' like m & m
On the block get jump off like Kim 'n 'em
On the block is how you can feel it in your skin
Shorties get the game with no instructions of asemblin'
Odds right it seems like the fight is dim in him
Call my man cousin like I'm kin to him
He tryin' to stay straight, the streets is bendin' him

I walked in the crib, got 2 kids
And my baby momma late (uh oh, uh oh, uh oh)
So I had to did what I had to did
Cause I had to give (dough, dough, dough)
I'm up all night gettin' my money right
Until the blue and whites (popo, popo, popo)
Now the money coming slow, but at least a nigga know
Slow motion better than (no-oh, no-oh, no-oh)

It's all good in the hood like rats and gyms
Fullbacks and tims, blacks and rims
Whether on ball courts
Attires are ball shorts
We never fall short
With us it's all force like air ones
Some wave some air guns
The day of the fair ones it's over fo'
Cats is colder than four below, wha'sup?
I go toe to toe
Wondering if it's for the art or for the dough
Though I know to grow a nigga gotta learn to let go
Though I know the dough I gotta bring back to the ghetto
Aeros or Tarot cards pointin' to the grind
Po' livin' and mo' prisons pointin' to my mind
Shine the light up!
Clench my fists tight and holdin' it right up
Freedom fight in dark gear for the years to get brighter
Situations, the jaws get tighter
My man trying to get his way to higher

I walked in the crib, got 2 kids
And my baby momma late (uh oh, uh oh, uh oh)
So I had to did what I had to did
Cause I had to give (dough, dough, dough)

If I can just swallow my pride

She was a bad, uh
The type at the club niggas would grab her
Fantasize when I had her in the bathroom sweating with her ass up
The body of a dancer
We had chemistry 'cause she was a cancer
Thought forever it would last for, but forever moved faster so I had to: Go!

Still, I got to pause when I think about her in them drawers
And, ooh baby she liked it raw
And, like rain, when she came it poured
And, like a car I can't afford, I would want it, then want some more
The positions our frames explored let me know she was secure
Back for more

Freaky, like the daughter of a pastor
Said I was bait and for me to mack her
Little red Corvette? Naw, she was faster
Wet dreams, Lemair Cream and after
We'd make love and then laughter
And any way I wanted I could have her
Said it was some girls that did attract her
A new chapter she was after, so I said let's go!
To a place that you want to be
Get what you want from her and me, free love I wanna see
Hot sex in the third degree, you're getting served while serving me
Dirty words encourage me to rock steady and sturdily
On you're turning me, no turning back, the further we: GO!

Wish I was free as Che was, I spend a day buzzed
Tripping on heights, wishing for Nikes in different flavors
The age of Kane and Big Daddy,shown by the caddies
Uncles named Larry, that really never grabbed me
My mother gave birth but she really never had me
Left to the hood to play daddy
Raised by niggas named Butch through the bay bay
With waists so they weigh they status on the streets
License plates that say they, motto This is Chicago in the hay day

So many niggas, stacked upon each other
It's the black upon each other that we love so much
Wonder how many of us, these drugs gonna touch
Used to gang bang, ain't really thug that much
Rather have some thick broads then the dutch to clutch
Went to school in Baton Rouge for a couple of years
My college career got downed with a couple of beers
Came back home, now I gotta pay back loans
Same nigga, same block, same shit they own
Only thing different, quicker, they click that chrome
In my defense, yo I had to hit that zone
Man to man, I'm good working with my hands
My generation never understood working for the man
And, of being broke I ain't a fan
Now I stand in the same spot, as my old man
My life I planned not to be on this corner
I still wanna see California
But this is my world

Four pounds and pounds a verb from out of towners
It's hard to stay grounded
We stay high, that's why old folks down us
Lost, nobody found us, the force that surrounds us
Ain't with us, they get us on the ground and hit us
We paint pictures of the chains under their names and scriptures
Removed from earth, only to return through birth
Knew this girl selling her body, wish she knew what it was worth.
Between God and trash, looking in every car that pass
With a walk that suggests head, to milk niggas she was breastfed
She know dairy so she say cheese to get bread
In the area where it's more weaves and less dreads
Kinda scary, amongst thieves and base-heads
Said it was her toes, but I could tell her soul hurt
She was cold turk, growing up she got to know hurt
very well in a world where self hate is overt
Her step-father that he was ike, so her mother he striked
she got to like like minded niggas, who liked crimes and figures
Doing white lines and liquor, see hard times had kicked her
In the ass, it used to be thicker
Life is fast, some choose to be quicker
I remember in high school she had a passion to sing
Now she see herself in a casket in dreams
These are the children of crack and rap, blacks done lack
Self-esteem, yo we forgot the dream
On our Jefferson's y'all but we forgot the theme
In the Chi, we even rooting for a garbage team

On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me

Yeah, you know what love is
Even found it on the ground where the thugs live
My man had to dig deep to find his
Couldn't sleep 'cause on the real he had five kids
Live nig's, real niggas express and taste it
At crap games, black dames and big faces
Cases in court, fam' showin' love and support
You and your baby's mom thought that love was a sport
As men we were taught to hold it in
That's why we don't know how 'til we're older men
If love is a place I'ma go again
At least now, now I know to go within
At time it can take ya for a spin
Heartbreak hotel then you're home again
I've seen love make a nigga soul pretend
Like a story that he don't want to end

On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be

It's all love where we come from
In the hood love we was told to run from
That same hood where the guns sung
We holla love, hopin' it would come one
Crack got so many lives undone
From lack of love many hide some run
I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of actin' in plays
Demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze
Tryin' to find herself again, much of that she'd have gave
Love can free us, to it some of us react as a slave
Funny, we love 'em more when they're relaxed in a grave
Wonder if a thug is raw, is he actin' afraid?
Everybody loves sun, why do I attract shade?
Heard of the love of money, but compassion it pays
Talk about it with my youth so she'd understand
What it is to be loved by a man

Seen the hardest nigga soften wit' his homie in a coffin
We walk and stand in, fall in it
With the right companion we all in it
Mary sang a song about it, having broad limits
In the game of life, it's the scrim age
Reminiscing on letters I wrote in my small days
A letter to the people, love always

[Verse 1]
Real People walk in the streets, the streets is talkin'
Often it's beef this city never does
People walk and talk in they sleep
Cold sweats and wet dreams
On how to get green our faith is all in a jeep
Black souls raw and they deep
Hypes tryin' to talk with no teeth
Shorties sayin' ball or retreat
A lesson we all speak at one point or another
What you expect from one who smoke a joint with his mother
Anointed hustlers in a fatherless region
Through the pain wish they know that God was just teachin'
We want decent homes
So dreams we say out loud like speaker phones just to keep em on
It's like a colored song that keep keepin' on
I guess knowin' I'm weak is when I'm really bein' strong
Somehow through the dust I could see the dawn
Like the Bishop Magic Juan, that's why I write freedom songs
For the real people

[Verse 2]
I wonder is the spirits of Bob Marley and Haile Selassie
Watch me as the cops be tryin' to and pop and lock me
They cocky, plus they mentality is Nazi
The way they treat blacks I wanna snap like paparazzi
We're the children of a better God searchin' for better jobs
We could cop ghetto cars tryin' not to catch a charge
They say the dope game is sour
Now they doin' homework that's when they follow you for hours
Come to your crib and devour all that you work for
Must be more than paper these niggas hurt for
Through the purple haze I circle days I rhyme that work for pays
Tryna reverse the slave's mind and insert the brave mentality
Heard that it's drama at home
Can a dude break free and still get honored at home
I was told by a chief it's the games nature
When you're glowin' some will love and some will hate ya
It's real people

[Verse 3]
Black men walking wit white girls on they arms
I be mad at em as if I know they moms
Told to go beyond the surface, a person's a person
When we lessen our women our condition seems to worsen
The weary cursin' the sky
Talkin' to themselves givin' the version of why help and hurt in they eye
I live across from it, some of it I do be in
I be showin' niggas lives

Wonder how many of us, these drugs gonna touch
Used to gangbang, ain't really thug that much
Rather have some thick broads then the dutch to clutch
Went to school in Baton Rouge for a couple of years
My college career got downed with a couple of beers
Came back home, now I gotta pay back loans
Same nigga, same block, same shit they own
Only thing different, quicker, they click that chrome
In my defense, yo I had to hit that zone
Man to man, I'm good working with my hands
My generation never understood working for the man
And, of being broke I ain't a fan
Now I stand in the same spot, as my old man
My life I planned not to be on this corner
I still wanna see California
But this is my world

[Chorus Repeated Overlapping:]
""It's your world""

[Common] Yeah

[Verse 2]
Life and death law around us
Four pounds and pounds a verb from out of towners
It's hard to stay grounded
We stay high, that's why old folks down us
Lost, nobody found us, the force that surrounds us
Ain't with us, they get us on the ground and hit us
We paint pictures of the chains under their names and scriptures
Removed from earth, only to return through birth
Knew this girl selling her body, wish she knew what it was worth.
Between God and trash, looking in every car that pass
With a walk that suggests head, to milk niggaz she was breastfed
She know dairy so she say cheese to get bread
In the area where it's more weaves and less dreads
Kinda scary, amongst thieves and base-heads
Said it was her toes, but I could tell her soul hurt
She was cold turk, growing up she got to know hurt
Very well in a world where self hate is overt
Her step-father that he was ike, so her mother he striked
She got to like like minded niggaz, who liked crimes and figures
Doing white lines and liquor, see hard times had kicked her
In the ass, it used to be thicker
Life is fast, some choose to be quicker
I remember in high school she had a passion to sing
Now she see herself in a casket in dreams
These are the children of crack and rap, blacks done lack
Self-esteem, yo we forgot the dream
On our Jefferson's y'all but we forgot the theme
In the Chi, we even rooting for a garbage team
This queen never seen herself on this Corner
She still wanna see California
But this is her world

[Chorus repeated several times]

[Kids stating their dreams]

['POPS']
Be, be here, be there, be that, be this
Be grateful for life, be grateful to life
Be gleeful everyday, for being the best swimmer among 500,000
Be-nign, be you, be mom's mean pie, be little black sambo With bad hair
Be aware of what a lynch is, Be, be boundless energy
Be a four star ghetto general, be no one except I
Be a strong academic student, be an A student in sociology
Be food for thought to the growing mind, be the author of your own horoscope
Be invited, be long-living, be forgiving, be not forgetful
Be a proud run, only to return to fight another day
Be peaceful if possible, but justice in ways (?)
Be high when you low, be on time but knowing to go
Be cautious of the road to college, taking a detour through Vietnam or the middle east
Be absent of wars at any past or present fought amongst themselves
Be visual of foreclosure over your shoulder while begging
A nation built on free labor for reparation, Be a cartopogropher
Be a map maker, be able to find afro-american man
Search thoroughly it may be close to black man
Be ammended 5/5ths, be ammended 5/5ths human
Be the owner of more land than is set aside for wild life
Be cupid, to world government
Be found among the truth, lost tribe
Be at full strength when walking through the valley
Be not foolish as tender 18 of the mountain tops
Be a brilliant soul, sparkling in the galaxy while walking on earth
Be loved by God as much as God loved Gandhi and Martin Luther King
Be that last one of 144,000, be the resident of that twelfth house
Be....eternal!

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Lovin' you is lovin' me

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Lovin' you is lovin' me

Yeah, you know what love is
Even found it on the ground where the thugs live
My man had to dig deep to find his
Couldn't sleep 'cause on the real he had five kids

Live nig's, real niggaz express and taste it
At crap games, black dames and big faces
Cases in court, fam' showin' love and support
You and your baby's mom thought that love was a sport

As men we were taught to hold it in
That's why we don't know how 'til we're older men
If love is a place I'ma go again
At least now, now I know to go within

At times it can take ya for a spin
Heartbreak hotel then you're home again
I've seen love make a nigga soul pretend
Like a story that he don't want to end, yo

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Lovin' you is lovin' me

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Lovin' you is lovin' me

It's all love where we come from
In the hood, love, we was told to run from
That same hood where the guns sung
We holla love, hopin' it would come one

Crack got so many lives undone
From lack of love, many hide, some run
I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of actin' in plays
Demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze

Tryin' to find herself again, much of that she'd have gave
Love can free us, to it some of us react as a slave
Funny, we love 'em more when they're relaxed in a grave
Wonder if a thug is raw, is he actin' afraid?

Everybody loves [Incomrehensible] do I attract shade?
Heard of the love of money, but compassion it pays
Talk about it with my youth so she'd understand
What it is to be loved by a man, uh

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Lovin' you is lovin' me

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Lovin' you is lovin' me

Some say that I'm a dreamer 'cause I talk about it often
Seen the hardest nigga soften wit' his homie in a coffin
We walk and stand in, fall in it
With the right companion, we all in it

Mary sang a song about it, having broad limits
In the game of life, it's the scrimage
Reminiscin' on letters I wrote in my small days
A letter to the people, love always, yeah

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Lovin' you is lovin' me

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Lovin' you is lovin' me

Since I heard your voice
Where did the king go wrong?
Emotions that that they linger on
I guess cause I never knew a love so strong
So many hot girls
I need your warm

Someday's I would try but wasn't able to cry
I never been good at saying goodbye
I take a deep breath when the times is hard
When I reminisce over u, my god
I spent many years trying to be the heartthrob
I guess it's only right that I got my heart robbed
The scent of a room that reminds me of you
A hint of perfume it remind me of you
Take a look at the moon it remind me of you
Hope the stars and the gods 
Align me and you

Armor All flow cause it never get rusty
I ain't gotta say it, man dawg trust me
Bust somebody head, GLC where was we?
Still rock the Prada 'fore that, rock the Starter
Niggas had the Georgetown, the Magic way harder
Thinking back to the projects, and they way they tore 'em all up
Like when I do a project, and come back and tear the mall up

The broads, the cars, the half moon, the stars
I'm like Jeff Fort the way I get behind bars
Burn CDs with no regard for the stars
Come to the crib with conflict diamonds and they ours
Back in '94 they call me Chi-town's Nas
Now them niggas know I'm one of Chi-town's gods
We eating Joe, you still talking no carbs
A conscious nigga with mac like Steve Jobs

Your fly is open, McFly
The crowd is open I think I know why
I'm back from the future seen it with my own eyes
And yep, I'm still the future of the Chi
Back in college I had to get my back up off the futon
I knew that I couldn't cop a coup with no coupons
Look at that neutron on his green like crutons
People asking him, ""Do you have any grey poupon?""

You in the building but the buildings falling
You wouldn't be ballin' if your name was Spalding
My mind get flooded I think about New Orleans
Bout to school y'all niggas, you should call him August
I'm the sun that goes down but I'm still revolving
Southside walk it out, while still you're crawlin'
If rap was Harlem, I be James Baldwin
With money in the bank like G. Rap, we're calling

With niggas masked up like Phantom of the Opera
Dreaming of the day they push a phantom to the operas
Can't wait till they say, ""Ye ran up at the Oscars.""
Poppa, I heard his life is like a movie
Like when Em' played him and Mekhi played a rasta
Mexicans gonna love it like it was for La Raza
But this is for the mobsters, Holla
We some true chi-town legends, accept no imposters

Uh, the un-American idol, tower like the Eiffel
Lean wit it, rock wit it, Black like the Disciples
Know when to use a bible, and when to use a rifle
You rap like you should be on the back of a motorcycle
Caught a case of robbery, and 'Beat It' like Michael
Your career is a typo, mine was written like a haiku
I write to 'Do the Right Thing' like Spike do
Through Conflicts that's Crucial and Drama that's Psycho

Look like the type that be like ""No hable inglés""
She said you look like you rap, where's your bling'e?
And yours clothes is tight but you don't seem gay
I said naw, thats dude from NSYNC'e

And she ain't into hoopers, she was there to kick it

Spend so much on outfits she's about to get evicted
Said ""I'm married to this rap shit, looking for a mistress""
You can be by my side like Flavor and Delicious

Questions of marriage and I start dodging them

Get deep in love and then your needing some oxygen
As far as wives I was thinking like Solomon

Be on the treadmill, like OK Go
Had the body that you can't pay for
That means she had some D's on her, but they wasn't fake though
Had a drive, a Drive for Rodeo
She spent pesos on those labels
Spent class at the gym, striptease on the pole
She was so obsessed with her body and clothes
To every party she goes, trying hard to be chose
They say it's hard for a pimp, but extra hard for these hoes
Reading US or People mag, trying to get these scoops
Chasing an actor for a Bentley Coupe
She recruit a ball player from the Clippers
Then came the pumps off
Thinking she Number One, when she just a jump off
Doing all she can for a man and a baby
Driving herself crazy

One of the Diddy types, the Dame Dash dudes
Pushed the Maserati Sport, reading the ROB Report
Wanted to be Mike, but he was never live in sports
Since golf was in, he was in the driving course
To live the rap life is what he was striving for
Spending cash at the bar to get credit
Drinking Chandon just because BIG said
They say Ye is, but dude big-headed
Rocked the fur in the summer, so, somebody'll pet it
He had a fetish for shoes that's athletic
Pathetic on his myspace page, half naked

Too young for the marches but I remember these drums
The stark reality of wars and battles
We fought for ours, caught in ghetto tragedy
I talk to my aunt named Mattie Lee
And recognize the importance of family
Hand me a joint, good music, and room to breathe
Those that doubt Com' will soon believe
Can't judge the weave, my lady had one
I'm more like a fool for soul and passion
The price of gas rises, street life is pumpin' fast, lives is
I watched Crash and realize that we all survivors
No religion or race could ever describe us
My guys do dirt, move dirt, but never really talk about it
Forever begins just because I thought about it

Living once again, we live, then you're gone

Ashes and snowfalls
I wonder when the roll call for heaven gon' come
Forever gon' come
It's a cold world and I can never go numb
Look fear in the eyes, say I never gon' run
Sooner then later, I know the cheddar gon' come
For now I write the world letters to better the young
On tree by jury, together we hung
Now we let our chains hang and gang bang to maintain
'Ghanistan goin' through the same thing
It trickles down, at each other we aim pain
I shoot for stars, peace and exclusive cars
Through the ride I learned to earn hard
Watch gangstas turn God in the midst of war
No matter how much I elevate, I kiss the floor

That's when I knew we'd live forever through song

Child in a good school and know what her gift is

Punchlines are like jab pits to rappers
Whose careers now ashes
It's too many slashes in their name
Came in the game, these gun-clappers
From weak lines to clothing lines to an actress
I seen them dashing smash hits
I yell run nigga run
While I cook up classics
The weak hearted, become Babylon puppets
Making it hard for real hustlers
Touch the sky now and then, with a lady friend
Give thanks to the most that's how the day begins in the game.

From the streets of the Chi where some get high for leisure

The demeanor of the Ghetto, to never stay settled
Aldermen and corrupt men play Pharaoh
Good bring business to the hood like heralds
Five year olds walking by themselves in the street
The young die of cancer
I stop eating meat
Greet the gods on 87th street like peace
Even though it's war to G, got em facing the east
The game ain't tasting as sweet
Cats flow is still, and his compliance with beats
My radio station is deep, so F em

I spent many years trying to be the heartthrob
I guess it's only right that I got my heart robbed
The scent of a room that reminds me of you
A hint of perfume it remind me of you
Take a look at the moon it remind me of you
Hope the stars and the gods
Align me and you

Once the love was strong
Now it's long, long gone
Cause the pain, came down like a storm
I remained, holdin' on
Cause I want you, cause I want you
I want you, I want you

We do what we do
And we do what we live
I love this way
Cause I got it as a kid
Wit so much to give from it
I never hid
The love that I wrote on the mirror it got smeared
My friends say it was a change for the better
But I say, girl you changed my forever
Relationships they can be as strange as the weather
Rain or sun
We can sang this together

Cause I want you",I Want You

Though he knew that this corner wasn't the best of him
Hard streets and a life that crested him
Dirt police domestic beefs that's festerin

Two kids from hot sex no protection and
People don't see how AIDS is affectin 'em

Can't find a job so you robbin and hustlin
He killed marks and sold dope for cousin 'em
Can't believe they would be the ones bucking him

At heaven's gate, saying please Lord let me in

Her body move but her mind was manic'n
Thinkin I don't know where they hands have been
Relationships with men have been so damagin
She thought back to when she was at Howard and
Dreams of doing scenes with Terrence Howard and
Broadway plays and dancin with Alv and them
The ones that make it always ain't the talented
Some dreams get lost never to be found again
At first strippin seemed so empowerin
Most every girl wanna do it now and then
But bein meat every day is devourin
Cats puttin paper where she put powder and
Life would break her, now she powderin
She was high when she fell down and then
Crowd surrounding and, heart was poundin and
She fell into a deep sleep the siren sounded and
Seen bright lights in the midst of clouds and then
Talked to God, feeling like his child again
Said Lord let me live so I can make you proud again

Misunderstood
Cause we are, Misunderstood
Misunderstood, Don't let me be misunderstood
I'm just human, oh

The life we lead, will always lead us
And we pray that he, will never leave us
It's the price we pay, I guess that's the reason
Why my grandma sang, we all need Jesus

And we pray that he, will never leave us

I was delivered in this world as a crack baby
Hard for me to pay attention and I act crazy
Gotta get over from the tip, I watch the fat lady
Sing a song, on how we guerillas in warfare
And I'm the kingest kong
They say we dreaming wrong
Them same strips that them older cats lingered on
Now the Walgreens is gone, hope is killed fiends are born
We leanin on a wall that ain't that ain't stable
It's hard to turn on the hood that made you
To leave we afraid to
The same streets that raised you can age you
With other black birds that's caged too
A rage up in Harlem and the southside
Brothers is starving with their mouth wide open
Floating across state got the workout plans so they can move weight
The fate of the black man, woman, and child: maybe

He had game since he used to hoop at Chatham
Neither the ghetto nor defenders could trap him
The stones had his back and they'd pat him
He was living a life they couldn't fathom
Colleges getting at him with all type of scholarships
Even if he went they knew he'd leave college quick
For the pros the one from the hood that was chose
The black rose that grew in the jungle
But humble stud still had rumble in his blood
Women all around giving him trouble love
You know the love when you up they down
Cause you wrap a ball they round
Your win is their crown
Dudes in the circle he known for years
Shared beers and cheers but chose different careers
When paper and fame came they ain't know how to react
Them same studs shot him in the back
Now that's black, maybe

When we talk about black maybe
We talk about situations
Of people of color and because you are that color
You endure obstacles and opposition
And not all the time from, from other nationalities
Sometimes it come from your own kind
Or maybe even your own mind
You get judged, you get laughed at, you get looked at wrong
You get sighted for not being strong
The struggle of just being you
The struggle of just being us, black maybe

Since old girl was with this, I told her friend to kiss this 
And listen physical fitness use your brain and mind your business 
Dipping from a distance, in an instance I got the digits

Bailed back around the flat, to wash off the smell of cat 
Like a belt, everything was strapped 
'Til my homey asked, ""What's up with that?"" 
The that was like dis G, I told him I got busy 
This was the spy who dissed me cause he told it like a sissy 

That was foul, I went to him lost in the mind now it's a dead end

Yo  the education of the Lon chicka Lonnie Lynn 
Began, began with time 
Being my bloodline is one with the divine 
In time brother, you will discover the light 
Some say that God is Black and the Devil's White 
Well, the Devil is wrong and God is what's right 
I fight, with myself in the ring of doubt and fear 
The rain ain't gone, but I can still see clear 
As a child, given religion with no answer to why 
Just told believe in Jesus 'cause for me he did die 
Curiosity killed the catechism 
Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to 
And became a slave to master self 
A rich man is one with knowledge, happiness and his health 
My mind had dealt with the books of Zen, Tao the lessons 
Koran and the Bible, to me they all vital 
And got truth within 'em, gotta read them boys 
You just can't skim 'em, different branches of belief 
But one root that stem 'em, but people of the venom try to trim 'em 
And use religion as an emblem 
When it should be a natural way of life 
Who am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right 
That's who got you doing right and got you this far 
Whether you say ""in Jesus name"" or Hum do Allah 
Long as you know it's a bein' that's supreme to you 
You let that show towards others in the things you do 
'cause when the trumpets blowing, 24 elders surround the throne

Only 144,000 goin' get home 
Only 144,000 goin' get it baby 

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
I've lived and I've learned 
I have taken and I've earned 
I have laughed, I've cried 
I have failed and I have tried 
Sunshine, pouring rain 
Found joy through all my pain 
I just want to be happy with being me 

[Cee-Lo]
Let me voice my concern 
So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title 
That their actions didn't earn 
Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence 
Subconsciously, seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince 
I've finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place 
Cause it's hard to correct yourself when you don't know 
Who you are in the first place 
So I try to find the clue in you 
But evidently, White folks know more Black history than we do 
Why're we bein' lied to? I ain't know our history was purposely hidden 
Damn, somethin' in me want to know who I am 
So I began my search, my journey started in church 
It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief 
Hustling was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets 
Taught me survival from this evil I'm just gonna have to deal with 
And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school 
It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only 
Science and math are universal 
Taking elder advice, read the Bible, the Koran 
Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites 
Hold on, this ain't right, Jesus wasn't White 
Some leads were granted with insight 
And it's all in the plan, but it took me some time to over stand 
He still created with the imperfection of man 
So, with followin' I disagree 
By no means have I forgotten or forgiven what's been done to me but 
I do know the Devil ain't no White man, the Devil's a spiritual mind 
That's color blind, there's evil White folk and evil niggas 
You goin' surely find there's no positivity without negativity 
But one side you gonna have to choose 
Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse 
So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession 
Become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and

Reminding me of Sef what? 
Fat fat thick booty what? 
You say jack that big booty  yo 
He say OOH OH 
I heard the boy he said oh
The party people he said oh
Check it  check it 

Driftin on a memory  brought forth 
From a fifth of Hennesey as in times 
Of eighty nine they envision me 
Warm days and the cold beer chemistry 
Eventually broken up by responsibilities and such 
Sometimes this era mentally I reconstruct 
High school I came out it 
Cats with clout at graduation got they name shouted 
Go to Great America, me and my lady rock the same outfit 
My niggas be fucking girls that she hang out with 
Round then Guy came out with, 'Piece of My Love' 
Arguing over if he said, ""Dumb bitch"" 
Everyday the same old with rainbow, watching the sun twist 
Cool as a Mig Dry, that in the trunk shit 
After parties in Wendy's parking lot, unfamiliar faces got marked a lot 
Showing off for hoes in bricks and rows had us charged to box 
That demo sorta stopped once A.C. got popped 

[Chorus: Chantay Savage]
It's reminding, mmm whoa yeah
It's reminding, hey yeah

[Common] 
Check it 
Before these minds got a hold to some drugs 
And start thinking they thugs 
We'd be at the Bismarck, and the Racquetball club 
Plugged with Gucci promotion so we got in free 
Against the wall me and my guys formed a colony, Ron'll be beating
Saved my day, dancing on speakers 
Flames snatched I was born this way 
87th Street and Hyde Park was warring 
Over gossip, Kenwood bras was pouring 
Suited in three-quarter Jordan's, pro-models 
And started coach out the back of Beauty Shop Sevalas 
Buy the dope, put my name in they verse, EPMD 
I would quote, stolen leathers I'd sell, like a child of broke 
Behind the beat, I took my first shot of Henny 
It hit me in the chest like when them marks shot Benji 
Shame on the girl that left her Fendi around crew 
I'da go through it or, take it, we was bound to 
Traveling like Vice Lords, down to the taste 
Not wanting to bring my lady around crew cause they would snake 
House parties was the lick, behind bars we'd come up 
At em' I did the Hooper dance with my thumbs up 

[Chorus]

[Common] 
There go the break 
To get the break go, it go oh 
Yeah, it go oh
You heard the people they go oh 
Yo, check it, check it 

Nowadays niggas is fake, like that party at McCormick Place 
I don't draw with em, cause they was born to trace 
At times I contemplate moving to a warmer place 
Then the Lake and skyline, give me a warm embrace 
Reminding me of the pointed parties Moe used to mace 
Six deep in the Hyundai bumping Twilight Tone tapes 
Come home late calling broads hang up on they mother 
If it wasn't nowhere to scrap at then we would fight each other 
Get a room at the Dunes having bakeouts 
We'd eat, at Giadonno's and break out 
Then everybody thought that they could spend 
High rollers had the MCM blazer blend 
Girbauds and Guess jeans we was taking in 
Cranes and freight trains we was breaking in 
Tim a be basin Mike down at I.I.T. 
Remembering numbers depended on how high I'd be 
It's a Deja-Brew, when I see bottles of Gill 
My man Sef passed I feel hollow but still

Fuck waiting under my skin, the situation is scraping
Somewhat like the girl X-rating
It's hard to be patient with no VCR or PlayStation
Knowing your Rockports, somebody may be lacing
Make me wanna leave the city when I can't take a vacation
Without somebody breaking in my demonstration
For some South side information, I search the Nigga-net
It certain things about this I ain't figure yet
Dirt, the guy who stayed with me and had a set of keys
Because his job had been stopped smoking weed
Thursdays is off days, he usually watch his seed
For him to have done it, a babysitter and a car he would need
The stripper broad, my TV and couch, she couldn't carry it
Unless some nigga helped and that's who she'll get buried with
She was vegetarian and she wouldn't have cooked chicken
I confronted her with it, to her story, she was sticking
The plot thickens, as we drove in search of this hype
Who I ain't know by name, but I knew by bike
Chances of him breaking in, chilling and eating
Are about as slim as he is
Though I knew where he lived
In his house with three kids, one I was cool with
As we roll, I told the guy, turn on the music
Just as I thought I closed in on one suspect
The nigga who did it popped the tape in the deck

(Excerpt from a movie)
Just tell me why. 
Don't lie to me man, just tell me why
It's the money, alright?
Just tell me why
It's the fucking money, alright?

Common,"Yo, we gotta start respectin life more why'all
You look at your brother man you gotta see yourself
Gotta see the God within him
Brothers gettin changed real quick over nothin
We losin too many of ours
Gotta recreate why'all
Yo, check it

Knowin you the best part of life, do I have the right to take yours
Cause I created you, irresponsibly
Subconciously knowin the act I was a part of
The start of somethin, I'm not ready to bring into the world
Had myself believin I was sterile
I look into mother's stomach, wonder if you are a boy or a girl
Turnin this woman's womb into a tomb
But she and I agree, a seed we don't need
You would've been much more than a mouth to feed
But someone, I woulda fed this information I read
to someone, my life for you I woulda had to leave
Instead I lead you to death
I'm sorry for takin your first breath, first step, and first cry
But I wasn't prepared mentally nor financially
Havin a child shouldn't have to bring out the man in me
Plus I wanted you to be raised within a family
I don't want to, go through the drama of havin a baby's momma
Weekend visits and buyin J's ain't gon' make me a father
For a while bearing a child is somethin I never wanted to do
For me to live forever I can only do that through you
Nerve I got to talk about them niggaz with a gun
Must have really thought I was God to take the life of my son
I could have sacrificed goin out
To think my homies who did it I used to joke about, from now on
I'ma use self control instead of birth control
Cause $315 ain't worth your soul
$315 ain't worth your soul
$315 ain't worth it

[Lauryn Hill (two layers of vocals, same words)]
I, never dreamed you'd leave, in summer
You said you would be here when it rained
[Common] Yo
Why didn't you stay

Seeing you as a present and a gift in itself
You had our child in you, I probably never feel what you felt
But you dealt with it like the strong black woman you are
Through our trials and tribulations, child's elimination
 
An integration of thoughts I feel about the situation
Back and forth my feelings was pacin
Happy deep down but not joyed enough to have it
But even that's a lie in less than two weeks, we was back at it
Is this unprotected love or safe to say it's lust
Bustin, more than the sweat in somebody you trust
Or is it that we don't trust each other enough
And believe, havin this child'll make us have to stay together
Girl I want you in my life cause you have made it better
Thinkin we all in love cause we can spend a day together
We talkin spendin the rest of our lives
It's too many black women that can say they mothers
but can't say that they wives
I wouldn't chose any other to mother my understanding
But I want our Parenthood to come from Planning
It's so much in my life that's undone
We gotta see eye to eye, about family, before we can become one
If you had decided to have it the situation I wouldn't run from
But I'm walkin, findin myself in my God
So I can, discipline my son with my writin
Not have a judge tellin me how and when to raise my seed
Though his death was at our greed, with no one else to blame
I had a book of Afrikan names, case our minds changed
You say your period hasn't came, and lately I've been sleepy
So quit smokin the weed and the beadies and let's have this boy

Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears

Driftin' on a memory, brought forth
from a fifth of Hennesey, as in times
of eighty-nine they envision me
Warm days and the cold beer chemistry
Eventually broken up by responsibilities and such
Sometimes this era mentally I reconstruct
High school I came out it
Cats with clout at graduation got they name shouted
Go to Great America, me and my lady rock the same outfit
My niggaz be fuckin' girls that she hang out with
Round then Guy came out with, 'Piece of My Love'
Arguin' over if he said, ""Dumb bitch""
Everyday the same old with rainbow, watchin the sun twist
Cool as a Mig Dry, that in the trunk shit
After parties in Wendy's parkin' lot, unfamiliar faces got marked a lot
Showin' off for hoes in bricks and rows had us charged to box
That demo sorta stopped once A.C. got popped

It's remind-ing... mmm whooahhh yeahhh
It's remind-ing... heyyeahhahh, uh-huh

Check it
Before these minds got ahold to some drugs
and start thinkin' they thugs
We'd be at the Bismarck, and the Racquetball club
Plugged with Gucci promotion so we got in free
Against the wall me and my guys formed a colony, Ron'll be beatin'
Saved my day, dancin' on speakers
Flames snatched I was born this way
87th Street and Hyde Park was warrin'
Over gossip, Kenwood bras was pourin'
Suited in three-quarter Jordans, pro-models
and started coach out the back of Beauty Shop Sevalas
Buy the dope, put my name in they verse, EPMD
I would quote, stolen leathers I'd sell, like a child of broke
behind the beat, I took my first shot of Henny

It hit me in the chest like when them marks shot Benji
Shame on the girl that left her Fendi around crew
I'da go through it or, take it, we was bound to
Travellin like Vice Lords, down to the taste
Not wantin to bring my lady around crew cause they would snake
House parties was the lick, behind bars we'd come up
at em' I did the Hooper dance with my thumbs up

[Chorus]

There go the break
To get the break go, it go OOH OH
Yeah, it go OOH OH
You heard the people they go oh oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Yo, check it, check it
Nowadays niggaz is fake, like that party at McCormick Place
I don't draw with em, cause they was born to trace
At times I contemplate movin' to a warmer place
Then the Lake and skyline, give me a warm embrace
remindin' me of the pointed parties Moe used to mace
Six deep in the Hyundai bumpin Twilight Tone tapes

Come home late callin' broads hang up on they mother
If it wasn't nowhere to scrap at then we would fight each other
Get a room at the Dunes havin' bakeouts
We'd eat, at Giadonno's and break out
Then everybody thought that they could spend
High rollers had the MCM blazer blend
Girbauds and Guess jeans we was takin' in
Cranes and freight trains we was breakin' in
Tim a be basin Mike down at I.I.T.
Rememberin' numbers depended on how high I'd be
It's a Deja-Brew, when I see bottles of Gill
My man Sef passed I feel hollow but still

It ain't hard to tell, it's hard for me to fake it
Plus, it's hard to be me, it's hard to stop drinkin
I guess it's hard for you hard niggas to start thinkin
Pussy MC's stinkin so I can't get hard
Some, become MC's cause it's hard to get a job
Hard for you to trust people, you don't trust in God
Even harder to be the Gods we created to be
This Western way of life ain't native to me
Put one nigga in your Pulp Fiction and relate it to me?
I hate it that we, the only race that call our women hoes
Niggas, be too hard to say ""ho"" at the shows
I rose... like a florist to bring the flavor like a Taurus
Might not have the murderous verse, but I stay hard to the chorus
Took this girl to work, she say I ain't have a real job
Like that dick you had last night, baby, I work real hard
Simple motherfuckers tellin me hard is criminal

I never knew a luh, luh luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin' for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter and finally decide to send it

Signed, sealed, delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault 'em 'cause I probably did it too

Because of you feelings I handle with care
Some niggaz recognize the light but they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work

I wanna be the one to make you happiest, it hurts you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close
To the most, high
Regardless of what happen on him let's rely

There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Yo, yo, check it

It's important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you

Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold star night's moon, you my light

If heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call

So I pray everyday more than anything friends will stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually?
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side, oh darling
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Yeah, yo, yo, check it

It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you ship hop when it's time to, thinkin' you fresh
Suggestin' beats I should rhyme to

At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence

The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal
It's how I must treat you

As my reflection in light I'm a lead you
And whatever's right, I'm a feed you
Digga da, digga da, digga da, digga digga da da
Yo I tell you the rest when I see you, peace

There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light, that shines
Special for you and me
I'll take my chances before they pass, pass, pass
Pass me by, oh darling

Common,"Let's do it now, it's me and you
Close my eyes Erotica, I'm seein' you
Listen to me wishin' I could be with you
To share my love and ecstasy with you

Are you alone? Is your shorty asleep?
Hold on, that's okay, ignore the beep
For you, my love is immortal deep
You are my queen but I can't ignore the freak

Let's let our bodies talk and our auras speak
Hold on, gotta get the toiletries
As our waters reach distances unheard of
I'm in the room nestled sweet and I observe love

Only for you, I ask God to show me the truth
What he showed me was you
Wherever I go, my soul leads to you
Days gone, nights lonely for you

Erotica, wet dreams are on my mind
Erotica, can I come in your mind?
Erotica, oh yes, with love I shine
Erotica, wish on star *69, Erotica, wish on star *69
Erotica, wish on star *69, Erotica

So much I wish you were here with me now
My bad, I just hit redial
I want you to come and never leave now
Is your mind and your right hand free now?

Our love reach deep down inside of it
As the candle burns, where desire's lit
Makin' love knows no distance or environment
When we ah, feel the most high in it

I feel you touchin' me and I begin to rise from it
Your love is stuck in me, our minds are so alive and thick
Picture my hands on your waist as I stare in your face
Your mouth half open, your love I can taste

Embracin' you, life, I let go
Gotta switch phones 'cause this one is ghetto
Another level of love we create when we take it to
And when it's made, Erotica, it's made for you

Erotica, wet dreams are on my mind
Erotica, can I come in your mind?
Erotica, oh yes, with love I shine
Erotica, wish on star *69, Erotica, wish on star *69
Erotica, wish on star *69, Erotica

Slave to your loneliness
(Slave to your loneliness)
Inside of loneliness
(Inside this, alt we bear)

With love of loneliness
(With thoughts of loneliness)
Enslaved by loneliness
([Incomprehensible])

I want you to come inside your mind
And find a place nasty and kind
This is where our desires grind
And where they peak Is most divine

A place and time, I hope we reach together
You are my queen and freak forever
I feel you inside my stomach
My body shakes

Wet dreams are on my mind, Erotica
Can I come in your mind? Erotica
Oh yes, with love I shine, Erotica
Wish on star *69, Erotica, wish on star *69, Erotica

Get on the mic, talk about cars and clothes sounding like hoes
Ain't been exposed to the foes of most disciples
I'm from the state that is Ill, the rap son of man rotated down to Phil
To say what I feel, get it off my burnt chest, my word becomes flesh
War going on between the West and the East
Of the land niggaz don't own a piece

Grease is the word, Murray slides some pimp oil to me
My lady friend sneaks my beer in the movie
Throw your hands in the air if you the true and living
Beware the new world order, the Devil's new religion
Sent my homey to the number two division

Sellin' bootleg movies, got my VCR on a evasive maneuver
Be that as I chooses, drinkin' tropical
It's just sittin' at a table with sophisticated bitches
Nah, that ain't nothin', I would call my mother
Nor do I call every nigga, my brother
Gotta have Black Thought, it's sorta be like Malik
So don't Question a Brother to the Roots, I get deep

Yo enter the last era
Your scholarship into the world of politics and mascara
We operate within this artificial opera
I bring hip hop terror like the Fuhrer, the Ace Ventura into the horror
Laboratory laborer, venture beyond the border
I'll structure a style, destroy your whole aura
Plus you're adrenalin'll rise before your eyes and mortalize
My image hit the skies, deceive the Devil in disguise
My music, I parenthesize, represent the wise
Do this, be how we enterprise, kid, no compromise

I'm thinkin' fast like drama, dyin', I wear your mind away like Alzheimer
I pull a mic up out my bomber big up to Bahama

Expose how they was average and they thoughts not rapid
Here comes the hot package, through your block like traffic
The rock was typed graphic, now watch the mic blast it

Shootin' at the stars with emphatic rap static
See the mirror shatter from thoughts, I'm bustin' back at it
The Lieutenant, the elephant, sippin' automatic
Mic, rippin' Asiatic, architects out to have it
The turn of the century, the planet's like a penitentiary
Exaggerated, niggaz is livin' highly medicated

I used to love but now she violated
Hip-hop holocaust and camps, old champs are concentrated
They outdated and incarcerated
Loved and appreciated, hated and very debated
For every career created was eliminated
And that's the way the balance of yin and yang related

As the block is divine, niggaz swing on in a safari
Wild niggaz like I'm high on latari
Some let the block block they mind if they could see what I see
Get out the city for a sec, be at the places I be

Hey, I'ma be back on the deck
Opening business in places for you to cash your check
My neck of the woods ain't all good, ain't all bad
You can live in the burbs and still get had

The sad part about it, niggaz had houses on the lake
They tryin' to move us out, the land we ain't appreciate
For peace we skate, crackers we roll or player hate
Call each other 'cause, 'cause of how we relate
I see way too many Cadillacs with dope man plates
Through the wind and blow ups is how niggaz communicate
Harmonizing through beepers and reefer

I leave all my walks so the fight don't die,and me
I found the purpose why I'm MC
Inspire a young world to be greated than me.
I fall awake and a dream a song,
So the little shorty's could sing along.

[Chorus: x2]

Welcome children, welcome me
Your sentimences felt in me,
I see the future and the walk your path,don't let these fools take you off your path.
Laugh if you need to,smile if you need to,
Life is a trip while a long and proceed to,
Try to believe to, do what you wanna do, remember you kings and queens are still humble to,
Life is a bitch now need to look back again,
Victory can be claim while you still battling,
Drive along with the food I provided you,
To awaking the boy's that is inside you.

[Chorus: x2]

Change is avreble,you can't stop it, changes happening and
Everybody is like.
Changes is like a furious hurricane that you can't stop
What is change? change is Marin Luther King Jr., Ghandi,

And you can't forget Common,
Changes gonna happen,change is hope.",Changes
Common,"[Chorus:]
How did you know I been waiting for this time to come
And though it tastes like for ever it may not stay long?
Everywhere it's summer [repeat 4X]

A shaman since before my birth
And I came down to rock the earth
My mission condition:
I give you, you listen
I'm syncing in time in parallel
In binary, no third return
I'm planning intention
With love the redemption

[Chorus]

No pop, no pop, no pop, no pop
We gon' do this thang till the sky just drop
Lock into you mind away we rock
In a rocket is the eighty seventh astronaut
Top of the soul, dove and I got in a hole
At the moment they were sayin'
It was outta control
Strap into your mind
Why eyes see some recline
You'll see in time your season to shine
When the stadium is dark
MC's are defined
Get ready, on your mark, put your feet on the line
The race is on, to space beyond
You gon' get there by doin' what you want
Sometimes the most famous feel all alone
So we trip to a place that we call our home
I was known as being spaced and outta my dome
Now I know, it all I've known

Common,"Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

[Chorus]
Nothing you can do [Repeat: x4]

They say he's a radical, he don't fit the game
A heart full of glory and a fist of pain
A couple of battle scars but shit's the same
Are you not entertained
So all the onlookers and the bystanders
Wait til intermission, run buy your camera
Record the moment, cause it'll be platinum
And you could say you seen Common rock the stadium

[Verse 1]
I was told by a wise old to come from the heart
Though I might've did The Light, I don't run from the dark
The dark knight to spark mics, and start fights
The warrior archetype like Kimbo Slice
It's strength in the beard, am I loved or feared
A beast amongst boys like Paul I'm revered...
Well,
Like Jacob Jewel, I keep clientele
You frail on the mic like you might break a nail
I might smoke a joint but I won't take the L
I knew a fat girl who broke the scale
Still touched down cause I was off Artell
Had dreams of breaking Mike Vick out of jail
Took the underground rail to the NFL
I rebel, NYSL
Here to leave a trail like Nelson Mandela

[Chorus]

[Common]
My words is the sword, my skill is the shield
My life is the style I stay dressed to kill
A legend like Will Smith with the steel
I could save the world when shit get for real
Skinny George Foreman, all in your grill
My rhyme style is blind, it's all in the feel
Touch it and watch the blood fall with the steel
The weak raps you wrote you could call that your will
My drive... Is how I stay the livest
Your guys got you gassed, my flow is a hybrid
Crashed I survived it, gashes over eyelids
You easy to take out cause you hot garbage
I'm amped like wattage, the truth nigga honest
Any moment opponents drop out like college
Kneel and pay homage to the rap Ziggy Stardust
Stadium hands in the air fists balled up

[Chorus]

[Common]
Feet in the dirt, blood on the shirt
Scars over bars, symbols of the work
Tight clothes the armor, center of the drama
Defeat your whole army like this is Sparta
So don't violate or you'll get violated
Some of you model bitches is so overrated
Don't mean to underrate it but damn it I made it
In the water I waded on the corner I painted
Draw blood like we related
MC's get de-decapitated
Syncopated is the style that I fight with, write with
Mr. Excitement, change your face up like a white chick
Then light shit up like a dread with the herbs
Get sex in the city and head in the burbs
These are the words of a radical
The crowd applaud, I'm bowed, I'm proud
To be the gladiator

[Chorus]",Gladiator

When it was she tried a nigga nurse it last (?)

The hunger of a homeless
Microphonus
Played the game - it got a bonus
Man is the plan
The master like Tiger
So much is the drive
I am the definition of a rider
Daughter's name means survivor
From a tribe-a
Colliders
Just one word can't describe her
A scribe of the streets

I wanna to chill sometimes the best things in life are not even planned

Deep waters they be in when they are just the manatee

The Magnanimous decision, unanimous, I am fed
What chu looking at, wait, I can help you with that
The Formidable, unforgettable painting Abstract
On the wall amongst them all from Warhol to Jean-Michel
A commodity, hot property, hears the morning bell
Guantanamo bayin niggas deferring routs
You soliloquies are trash inferring that you got clout
Homie, whats that about? You should revisit your scheme
Before the scheme it seems real it reverts back to a dream
Into that pea head of yours
You ain't commanding no tours
You seeing fee and per diem
We seeing that and the doors
Plus a little bit more because she choosing the prettiest
Thou while its wittiest
On the low we the grittiest
Taking the task, these barbaric insurgents
Who nursery rhyme niggas and play like they are crime figures
Man, what could give you such a naive belief?
There's examples all around of careers being brief
The Luke Cage of the loose leaf page
Run and hide, comin out in the yard

Challenges with riches we will put you on strict review
Time to turn the tide around

Brandishing these microphones, we outlaws in the town
Corruption in the fool pit, we witness the jam
Acquisition of materials the evil of man
Trickles down to MC's

With the good and hardy measurement
A real rap sediment
Degenerate genes and your bodies the host

Tried to get rich, but they label me filthy

Common,"Aston Martin king, Luther with dreams
The young Denzel the way I move through scenes
I’m like a preacher that once was a fiend
A story of change that came with wings
Pretty as the skyline, the sky is my eyeline
Son of the most so from up high I shine
Suited in Prada, stay mellow like lala
Young, fresh, with dollars, ladies go gaga
I’m the cum-lada, top of the class
Black Wall Street so my stock will never crash
Given what I ask, pure religion and cash
From the windows that open, I’m raising my glass
Daylight beams, night life schemes
This is my inception, I’m writing my dreams
Immortal view of a star doing what I’m born to do
I see the blue sky, see the Lord's coming through

Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light
Ohh, until high we'll shine at night
Now we in the skies, blue skies
And we going higher, that's right

It all started with a dream, I wanted to be Run–D.M.C
The Lord put the blessing upon the MC
O to the M, dreams were spoken to him
That's when I knew my flows would overflow to the rim
Open my eyes, yes sir this is what I'm made for
To go hard in the paint like D. Wade or
D. Rose, from the same streets that we rose
International heroes at world primos
Red carpet magic, taking pictures with the president
Told him for health care, my music is the medicine
My name holds weight, I am never hesitant
Different state resident, this is hood elegance
SLS classic, pursuing my passion
NOVA Fashion, now I'm Oscar party crashing
Immortal view of a star doing what I'm born to do
I see the blue sky, see the Lord's coming through

Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light
Ohh, until high we'll shine at night
Now we in the skies, blue skies
And we going higher, that's right

Silhouettes of dreams that we had high, huh
Even now it don't seem so bad ma
Close my eyes to see things in front of me
I'm gone now, imagine what I'm gonna be
Dirty to worthy, now I'm all wordy
My broad up in Paris, looking all purty
Immortal view of a star doing what I'm born to do
I see the blue sky, see the Lord's coming through

Now we in the skies, blue skies
And we going higher, that's right

I had these dreams in my head of an endless fear
I could see it from my window
Wouldn't take that long to get me there
Keep running til' I can go
Remember the beautiful things that life could give me
Crazy how I'm the one
Could've been any way, but I'm sitting in the air
With the wheels up staring at the sun
Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light
Ohh, until high we'll shine at night

Cinderella fancy, but she still look hood
Butt naked in the kitchen flipping pancakes
Plus she tricking from the dough that her man makes
We got our own handshake
Her titties ain't fake
Fucking in the car cause we just can't wait to get home
Early in the morn' getting stoned
Pretty with her eyes low, runny by Bible
The type of bitch that BIG said he would die for
Is the type that I would rather stay alive for
Tatts on her back, looking all tribal
She know shoes like she know survival
Well put together, she weathers the storm
Seen her brother die so forever she's strong
Hear Beyonce's song and she gotta perform
Whether fucking or fighting: we getting it on!

Baby in one arm, the other is a skillet
Frying chicken, macaroni

Ghetto press, she's my apolonni like
Tony, Montana
Reminded me of [?] or my mama
Knowing the drama like she know when to joke
Steal a nigga's squares, not wanting me to smoke
I poke my head out of Benzes

Subject matter be changing too quickly at times
So I keep it strictly 'bout dimes and stick to the story
Call me a pro in the pussy category
Had explicit experiences I shouldn't mention
For me, getting women turn from sport to addiction
Powerful women playing the roles of submission
Lawyers on leashes
Congress women inflicting pain onto my game
Warned that I'm sadistic
They liked it, they diked it, devices twisted
Til I get a nice chick, to get me on some nice shit
Crib raising kids, slap a door behind a white fist
But I'm still single, looking for Cleopatra
African Queen, yo look at me, I'm a bachelor
Y'all niggas in trouble, keeping girls behind closed doors
Cross your fingers, be happy I haven't chose yours
She loves glamor bought Vera Wang sandals
Valentino bags is my etiquette
My man is half hood half class
Photographers cameras caught us out there
The spotlight, I hope she can handle
She can join me, red carpet at my next non-profit
Event having sponsored by some alcohol product
Jumping out a Bentley with some fresh red bottoms

Feeding souls of those in need
I bleed the blood of the struggle
Walking over troubled puddles
Hustles in my chest, no hustle no progress
Extremities of life and it's process
Birth of a son, death of another
With love I can rest both mothers
And told ‘em, who’s in control is the one thats above us
I walk where money talks and love stutters
Body language of a nation going through changes
The young become dangerous, pain gets spent into anger
Anger gets sent through the chamber
It’s tough when your own look like strangers
We are the sons of gangsters and stone rangers
If he could how would Ernie Barnes paint us?
Look at the picture, hard not to blame us
But time forgives in the Chi where the young die often
Do they end up in a coffin because we haven’t taught them?
Is it what we talking we really ain't walking?
Dudes, hustlers pay, how much did it cost ‘em?
Find myself on the same corner that we lost ‘em
Real talking, in they ear like a walkman

By any ways necessary, under pressure
Children feeling lesser, with the steel up on the dresser
Killin' will aggressors, destiny’s children
Survivors, soldiers, in front of buildings they eyes look older
Hard to see blessings in the violent culture
Face against weapons, sirens, holsters
That ain't the way that Langston Hughes wrote us
Soul controllers on the shoulders of Moses and Noah
We go from being Precious to Oprah
Cultivated to overcome ever since we came overseas
Today and the way that you can see we determined
Solar keeps burning, shawty’s know to keep learning
Lesson’s in our life, but life stripes that we earning
Took gramps' advice that Christ is returning
Like a thief in the night, I write the beacons of light
For those of us in dark alleys and parched valleys
Street kids spark rallies of the conscience conquerors of a contest
That seems beyond us, even through the unseen
I know that God watches
From one King's dream, he was able to Barack us
The prophets, nothing can stop us

I appreciate the hugs and the days I breed with you
Strong seeds I can see with you, the good word I read with you
Looking at things that we've been through
Things that seem simple
I know when to go hard and when to be gentle
Sentimental laughs and expressions
Let's stay in the present, no time for second guessing
You said it's this cloth that makes you feel naked
The truth we address it, that's so unexpected

Taking notes from the sky to fly above understanding
They notes from the most high, so I gotta land them

Kinda took me back to when I first had a dream
To be like the king that sang Billie Jean

At the mountaintop, you still gotta dream

And we picked up lots of chicks and pots of gold
How I made it out with my soul

These are adventures of young black millionaires
I am the voice of the meek and underprivileged
The smell of success, I want y'all to get a whiff of this
On the move like black slaves through the wilderness
I write it, and still get invited to white Christmases
When I was born, three wise men came to visit us
One a hustler, one a king, one a prisoner
They cracked the bottle then started giving gifts
You from Chicago, we want you to deliver this
Show the walking dead who the true and living is
Separate the fake from who the real reals is
Hot tub time machine, back to the Sybaris
Hats from liquor stores to avoid syphilis
Frivolous spending, drunk nights with storybook endings
I guess it's my addiction to women
I was in France, in to see Hennessy blending
Writing my own scripts like I'm Tennessee Williams
Now it's new beginnings like a born again Christian
On the mic, victorious, story is redemption

I'm sitting at the top, I'm not alone
I'm standing here with my soul

Feed our souls with two fish and five loaves

My dad said it rained on my arrival
Now a storm of the brain make these guys drive slow
Like I was 5-0, but my creed's Apollo
On the rock and roll with the coldest live show
For those before I came, I made the song cry for 'em
Lyrical gymnast, you set the bar low
This is the Kilimandjaro, like Twitter you can follow
It may be hard to read like hieroglyphics
Written on the walls of Cairo, check my youth revival
Truth inside flow, I stand like Em did with Dido
Crash parties, any live yo

From the pride we'll reign, kill the game and watch it die slow

Never played a game but I heard about them sisters
A wise mister said love is gunna get ya
But that ain't what I read in the scriptures, Y'all eat with us
It was hard for me to take down the benches
I was tripping, I even called her sister
I could be someone you could talk to, each and every day
But you were 'bout to marry, be on your merry way
I'm singing through the pain like I was Mary J
Cause we break up to make up like Mary Kay
Rumors leaving tumors on my heart now
We fell in love huh just to fall apart now
I get your calls and I try to disregard now
What was easy for us now is hard now
Huh? Who do it better, we used to move together
Now we not together, is this our new forever?

Hell nah, I'm waiting on your call
Told you be I'll be back, had to break down some walls
Issues that I had, some say it comes from not seeing my dad, keep moving on
Hard for me to stay away and stay in touch
Girl, my heart is broke and I needa crutch
Thought I was okay but nights that I stayed up
Ass got me layed up, girl I never gave up
On you and us, I tried to take it day by day, and whew its tough
I know your young and you gotta live your life ma
I thought it was the right time for me to wife ya
I must confess, I miss the days of you laying on my chest

The Believer
If I were a believer, I believe I would believe in the beginning
Everybody's beginning
Mine, that my very first ancestors were front row and present
When God stepped to the mic
I believe from the creation of the Garden of Eden
The separation of the tribes
Our long marches across the desert
Being (?) kids
For instincts born in caves of ice
All, each and every one, the souls of one God
Granted earthly existence to allow each to earn
The blessing of transcending, time-traveling throughout the universe
With the blessings and well-wishes of my fathers, prophets of my own
No search, no steer no mysteries
We inherit the power to turn nightmares into dreams
For those of us who come from less than (?) circumstances
Dreams, good dreams, sweet dreams, dreams come true
Truthful dreams, truthful dreams become life
Life becomes belief, belief becomes live!
Live the life you believe
The American dream, the black American dream, the universal dream
For the sake of the unwritten laws of humanity, I believe in God
I believe in my ancestors, I believe in my offsprings
I believe in Dr. Savior, I believe we must stop Willie Lynch'n mention each other
I believe in the truth, truth

In your eyes I can see your soul

She was a beautiful rose
From the concrete and heat she grows
In the dark room her life was exposed
Her picture of men, we walk on all fours
Heart opened and heart closed
Every now and then she Sparkles
You can tell she was hurt by the words that she chose
I'm thinking like Lauryn, a rose is still a rose
Even when the door close, there grows a new one
I told her it's some good men, she asked me if I knew one
Her daddy left a hole because she never really knew him
Ok sometimes from commitment, we do them
Rocking Lou Vuitton, said she focused on the Christian
I'm speaking to her trying to enhance her vision

Looking at the rear-view, life's waiting for her
Gotta be there to support her
Can't really wait for a court order
She got the type of aura that's fun and vibrant
A lot of love inside, got to help guide it
Daddy will protect it, God will provide it
We all will be there so your soul ain't divided
Man, how quick she grows
Looking like her momma but she got my toes
I suppose it's the age that she really really need me
A lot of girls without, they become needy

Back and forth in these streets, that's the rhythm
Revenge is supposed to be the Lord's but I use my own accord
When I seen him on the porch, cost my man his life, I can't afford not to hit him
Shots ripping through his true religion denim
These streets was my religion
I stood over him, his life is over then

So in God we trust, leave the praying to my momma though
Another motherfucker out of control, just walking my soles low
Lit up with the abuse, they wasn't for show, I promise every pistol was used

Common,"Gluttony baby
Is I needs what I see
Gluttony baby
Is us, aside to seat two

It’s knocking
Man, they gon, they gon, man they gon knock this one
Ride out to this

It sit deep in my chest, so let me express
Grew up on 868, oh y’all don’t need the address
It was ‘round CVS, we were so devious
The city never sleeps, it be needing some rest
The streets was a mess, and they still are
Feel our pain, the bigger picture, we was all framed
But the game is the game, so let it begin
In these streets, these are the seven deadly sins
Now the first is pride, though some call it vanity
A hustler’s insanity can break up the family
Pride can have a man stuck in his ways, not subject to change
Knowing that I’ll end up in a grave
It’s the arrogant they saying us Americans
Messes up marriages, many sins, pride is parenting
Like the second is something we all have
Or felt, then cane or khan, it’s called wrath
I seen a boss take it out on his staff
I seen a crip take it out on a blood, causing a bath
Never seen a man making money while he mad
So hustle plus wrath, y’all do the math
Now the third, you probably heard from MOB
They say use them rocks to make em envy
Envy, the cousin of jealousy, on the streets it’s a felony
When niggas fucking with you commit fidelity
They hate it, to see you celebrated
Counting my paper, nigga you could have made it
Let me stay with that part, takes us to the fourth
Where niggas is lazy, that’s what we call sloth
Want you to break em off, getting money it costs
For you to be a boss, ain’t no taking off
Now the myth about the fifth, it only happens when we eat
It’s gluttony, this is how it happens on the street
It’s a dude that’s getting paid in full, causing jewels
Always played his four, but the way this nigga move
He is never full and he gon want your food
Don’t overdo it, that’s an underrated rule
The sixth is a fix that’s in all of us
When I get drunk and want to bust, this is what we call lust
When the drawers go down, the guards go down
Cause a pussy is somebody getting robbed right now
Okay the seventh is a seed that many believe
Is the cause of em all, this is what we call greed
Knew some cousins that was hustling, one of em ended up busting the other
Greed is a mother, it’s greedy motherfuckers like Madoff
Cops getting paid off, greedy companies got my people getting laid off
Before I sign off, in the sins we living
The good thing is we can be forgiven

This ain’t a game nigga, ain’t no options
Nigga selling on the block like an auction
Dig into my pockets, see a profit
Where the money and the bitches is where the guys is
Godfathers in a loches, at the spot holding money like a hostage
She went ostrich, from the projects with posture
I draw with the goddess like an artist
Getting paper with no margins, money gods
I do it for Hadiya and Trayvon Martin

In the Chi ain’t a damn thing funny
Thinking of ways to get money
Drive down Lake Shore, scheming how to make more
If we ain’t eating together what is this cake for
Ain’t nobody giving it, that’s what we take for
Niggas is broke, what I need to brake for
Glaciers of ice, lazers and lice
Let the chains glow heavy, we paid for em twice
Made for the life, all out like we out of bounds
Bars and guns, niggas got a lot of rounds
Tripping like you from out of town
The four pound will leave you on the ground without a sound
Ain’t no fathers round, sons of anarchy
Fighting attempts, trafficking, and grand larceny
At the party with the thots with the extra body
I’m in the inner city, it’s an out of body experience

Face on T-shirts with no hashtags
Just big ass trash bags tagged hash
Out here sipping trill
Fake ass gangster, quick to take a fag’s cash
Five versus six, Star Wars
No stickers, real bullet holes in car doors
Out of ten people that was shot, 7 ate 9’s
Two trey 8’s, and one 45
Tryna get to 23, numbers game
Then here come the fame
But they won’t say no names
Are these celebrities way too shy to be loyal to the town
I take my publishing check and spread my royalties around
Popes, bishops, disciples, stones
Counts, princes, lords, queens and kings
They drilling on my land but ain’t no order to be found
I might be part of the problem
I guess they just tryna prove they can back that shit up
Most of them can’t even moonwalk
My little cousin bum jay don’t know what he did when he introduced that goon talk
Is there a Scarface casting at the crib I don’t know about?
So many shortys have tried out for the role
That’s why he slide out and ride out with the pole
Now I see how my daddy felt the dark day he
Discovered that black power didn’t keep the lights on
Right on, the dearly departed still rapping to you
Looking for some yellow, white, red, black, brown flesh to write on
How long will they mourn me after I’m out of mind, out of sight, gone
A crash, a head on collision affects both riders the most
Good music in the building, yeah we got ghost riders
They just actually ghosts",Nobody's Smiling

Paid restitution, O from the lootin' enter
Cause they did it, you was influenced
Your mind gone, life don't seem much bigger
Than your time zone, broke as the rich get richer
Blunt burnt lips and a worn out liver
That's everyday livin', guns everywhere chillin'
Got you feelin' like this money comin' sooner than later
'Til then I'll be runnin' from the judge and the bailiff
Crime commitin' cause these women love a man in Mercedes
I never save for when it's rainy, hope Jehovah can save me
While I'm out don't buyin' tryin' to find my time

Should it be, can it be simple
Life is like the tempo of a No I instrumental
Things that we been through define who we are now
Since ""Can I Borrow a Dollar?"" Ooh I'm a star now
I'm coming from Chi-town, we was the first to do it
Me, No I.D., Twilite Tone on the music
The city on our back, we was the opening act
Throw our tapes in the crowd, they throw 'em right back
But we stayed on track, they stayed on the tracks
I stayed on the raps 'til we made it on the map
By then, No I was my main guy
He and I was like Chi-town's Gang Starr
We had came far together, with a long way to go
Seeing a bigger picture, but now from different angles
Tangle of the hustling, survival in the game
Felt I had to leave home to be a household name
Show money low, needin' to stack fast
City did have my back, now it's a backlash
Was I a slave to the cash and wanting it so bad?
I just became a dad, rap was all I had
So I moved to New York, to make it pop
Did ""Like Water for Choc"", that album changed a lot
But my man who I started with, wasn't a part of it
And his presence I didn't even acknowledge it
Knew I was wrong, he shoulda at least had a song
It wouldn't be me without No I.D., and Twilite Tone
Wishin' I could get that time back
Oh I care, yo man, rewind that
Me and Dion back in the zone, I'm doing shows with Tone
For the future of the Chi we gon' bring it back home
Rewind that and we could do it again
No I.D., Twilite Tone, where the story begin

Rewind that one time please

This one's for my man J Dilla
As I say these words, my eyes fill up
Cuz wasn't non' realer than James Dewitt Yancey
So I'mma dedicate this to Dilla and his family
In Q-Tip's basement, I first met JD
I still remember the first beat he played me
He came to the Chi late three that was crazy
Didn't even know me and gave 'em to me for free
I got the the D, ""peace yo, big love""
Cook up some hot shit, then go to the strip club
Then we made ""The Light"" and times got brighter
I said ""turn it up"" J'll take it higher
One day, I noticed he was tired quick
That's when I found out, JD was real sick
Things got worse before they got better
I said, ""come to L.A for peace and good weather""
We got an apartment just so we could spark it
MP in the front room, records in the closet
The beats got iller, but the sickness was still there
I'm wishin', I could wheel him out of his wheelchair
It was hard for me to come home every day
And see my homie J's life fade away
I stayed away some times, in other words I ran
Til one day J brought me this TV stand
It was a gift so I couldn't refuse it
It came from his heart, I regret I didn't use it
The lupus got worse and, for what it's worth
I wanted him to have a grammy before he left this earth
Wishin' we could have that time back
Oh we can, yo man, rewind that

Or radio, stereotypes we refuse
Brainwashed in the cycle to spin
We write our own story, black America again

You know, one way of solving a lot of problems that we got is lettin' a person feel that they're important
And a man can't get himself together until 
He knows who he is and be proud of what and who he is
And where he come from, and where he come from

Hot damn, black America again
Think of Sandra Bland as I'm staring in the wind
The color of my skin, they comparing it to sin
The darker it gets, the less fairer it has been
The hate the hate made, I inherited from them
But I ain't gon' point the finger
We got anointed singers, like Nina, Marvin, Billie, Stevie
Need to hear them songs sometimes to believe me
Who freed me: Lincoln or Cadillac?
Drinkin' or battle raps? Or is it Godspeed that we travel at?
Endangered in our own habitat
Them guns and dope, man, y'all can have it back
As a matter of fact, we them lab rats
You build the projects for, now you want your hood back
I guess if you could rap, you would express it too
That PTSD, we need professionals
You know what pressure do, it make the pipes bust
From schools to prison, y'all, they tryna pipe us
Tell your political parties invite us
Instead of making voting laws to spite us
You know, you know we from a family of fighters
Fought in your wars and our wars
You put a nigga in Star Wars, maybe you need two
And then, maybe then we'll believe you
See black people in the future
We wasn't shipped here to rob and shoot ya
We hold these truths to be self-evident
All men and women are created equal
Including black Americans

You know, you know, you know, 
One way of solving a lot of problems that we've got is 
Lettin' a person feel that they're somebody
And a man can't get himself together until he knows who he is, 
And be proud of what and who he is and where he come from, and where he come from

Ability to communicate and 
To talk, and to touch chords
A man who has the ability and the audacity
And the of God to stand up, to stand up

Heard the sound of the trumpets, the voice from the throne
Seen the twenty-four elders and I knew I was home
I was told to write songs for the people
Take the original Hebrews on an Exodus of Black Excellence
Tell them to invest in us and make testaments about each other
Or how we sisters and brothers
Cover the land in corners of poems and stone
Go hard with it, let em know you God with it
Even though I authored it, let no one margin it
And make it all about paper or first weeks sales
Though this is from Heaven give 'em verses from Hell
Those that fell off the path, bring them back to the Mass
The staff can be your microphone
Your name is Common
You was born to fight the norm
Take house niggas outta darkness till they lights is on
I'm a put a hyphen on your name
Rapper-actor-activist
You the one that can reach into the black abyss
Stars this asterix, show em what a classic is
Freedom riders need passengers
And your lyrics use scriptures and passages
To make them rise like Lazarus
And resurrected again, they'll put disrespect on your name and respect it again
Every section you in, bless em and keep bussin'
If they don't like it, shake the dust and say 'fuck 'em'
Until you get home, I'm the one you trust in

I'm happy to be in any place
Where God's name is remembered

Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world
Trouble of this world, trouble of this world
Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world
Going home to live
Going home to live
Going home to live

Go into the wilderness like Mussa on a pilgrimage
Streets are villages, speak with diligence
And authority to fake God of pharisees and sadducees
Give them that Gardley free from the Black Odyssey
Yo pardon me, you the God bodily
Functioning on earth as a part of me
That's why I gave you artistry
Go into the hoods with the shooters and the strippers
Forget the New World Order, New Jerusalem is with us
Tell sisters they earths and goddesses
If they got bottom, don't get caught in a bottomless
Pit, there's a lot of us fit for the kingdom is near
You can tell by the wars and how the seasons appear
You'll appear in circles in Hollywood, I birthed you
And Chicago, you know how to parlay good
You'll get Oscars, Emmys, and Grammys
Give those to your family, don't get caught up in the vanity
Or the world's insanity

Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world
Trouble of this world, trouble of this world
Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world

Nigga, you should rhyme wherever the spirit goes
Here it goes, lyrical miracles
These are pyramids from the imperial
In theory, though, low end scenario
It's sound boy burial drove me to classic material
Aerial nights blew my mind out of stereotypes
For ethereal heights, I write like Pritchard
Invisible man, pictured below with the hieroglyphicable
Prolifical flow, on the walls where the mystics of Kemet would go
Supreme wisdom in my system is the kick in the door
I don't rhyme for the sake of riddlin' though
This is a ritual for those depicted as low
Now I passed life like I've been here before
The reincarnation of It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold
Us Back, coldest raps
For me the globe is like a culdesac
Around the world in a day, find forever and I stay
I'm from the weather where they spray
There's gotta be a better way, people dying everyday
Wonder what would heaven say? Devils need to get away
From Chevrolet to Escalade, from evergreen to the everglades
I kneel where the rebels pray
Seen fifty gray, but they need better shades
Niggas rhymin' like their whole style in retrograde

On some Marshawn Lynch, let me run it back
And come with that new black spiritual
Every rap's a miracle, condition now critical
Game lack lyrical, we need black generals
Holy war, tap into you like Savion
But I'm a orator, the corduroy boy
Came the door-to-door name down the corridor of fame
I walk like an Egyptian on a mission to listen to conditions
Envision a vision of what we wishing
I've been commissioned to deprison the prism of your mind
Spit the wisdom of the one devine
Close encounter of the wonder kind, front a line

Influenced by the life of the former, Joanne Chesimard

If so? Then what am I stressing for?

Common Children,"In this festival of time
When I seek but will not find
Would you shine some feelings into my eyes
Could you climb with healing into my tired mind
Into my own mind

In this revelry of days
When I'm trapped inside my cage
Would you fly some easy freedom inside
Could you climb with healing into my tired life
Into my own life

When the silence burns my ears
And I frolic through my fears
When I stain myself in shame
I still whisper out your name

Oh, won't you come down
And burn your light through me
And save me
And heal me
Oh, won't you come down
And burn your light through me
And save me
And heal me

When the silence burns my ears

Won't you burn your light through me

Break you open
Spill you to the ground
It leaves you stranded
Empty handed
Hits you when you're down
Try and hold it back
When you're standing there with nothing
They're never coming back
But the memory is something

You should know by now
It's gonna hurt just like the first time
And this won't be the last time
Your heart comes crashing down

Sometimes this life can thrill you
Yeah it can fill you
With a faded kind of smile
Gives you this feeling
Like life is leaving
You're only here a while
You're in between right now
But the season's slowly changing
You find the hope somehow
The strength for rearranging

You should know by now
It's gonna hurt just like the first time
And this won't be the last time
Your heart comes crashing down

His horse and his cattle are his only companions

Waiting for summer, his pastures to change

Once lost in the darkness, blessed by sunlight
Once blind to the bounties of livin'? Lord, surround
Me with four women
To symbolize life, I'm born twice
For forty days and nights weathered the storm's tug
My mother's fear of the water taught me how to swim
Above
I fought waves as she prayed and never gave up
Her faith saved me, and I just wanna say ""thank you for
Your love""

My memories of childhood are like dreams
I'm a drifter ? thinkin' of my sister's like scenes
Of a movie; me screamin' ""you're not my mom,"" set to
Swing
You holdin' me yellin' to me ""I'm the next best thing""
Six years of separation's damn near a generation
But you never stopped trying to understand my
Motivation
And you always had my back when push came to shove
We're the same blood, through the rain's floods ?
""thank you for your love""

I've said it before, I'll say it to my death
I will never fully comprehend just why God left you
In my hands, when I could hardly stand, I guess

Steps
In stride ? me as a follower, you as a guide
Revealer of the way as you explain I play the scribe
Leader of the tribe ? reason that Abeo came alive
My name, my pride, I take time to ""thank you for your
Love""

Who would have ever thought we'd come this far?
Two renegades who finally made their way to the stars
Built a bridge over the river of doubt and made ""sound""
The foundation on which we would build this house
And aint that what matrimony's about; a shared vision?
We draw on the strengths of intellect and intuition
You're the symbolism of liberated women, the definition
Of
What a companion does ? ""thank you for your love""

Thank you all for your support in my times of need
Your belief in me empowers me to lead
And they wonder how I stand this firm to transgressions
Y'all taught to me the lessons every man must learn
Mother showed me how to fold my hands and thank God
Through my sister's eyes ? compromise was not hard
My daughter teaches me honesty and honestly
My wife teaches love for my mother, now my cipher's
Complete
(That's one love...)

One mother, one sister, one daughter, one wife
Once lost in the darkness; blessed by sunlight
Once blind to the bounties of livin' ? Lord, surround

We're consolidatin' the family ties ? we're drawn tight

Lit a cigarette and said 
""I don't give a damn
If we never come home""

In the old starlight
And a tender amazement 
Swallowed up the night

We could walk along, 
Be forever strong
Drive into the night, 
And the right and the wrong

It's how many people you set free!""

Bit my lip against the snow

That God was listening to me

Tore the smoking buildings down
Raised the red flag high
Burnt the reichstag brown

And he looked a lot like me
He had the same kinda farmer's face
Said he'd come from some place called Hazzard, Tennessee

You catch a high place cinchin, lucky you just the engine 
On a vision quest but my breathe is on 
Bad intentions to herd the lyrical peak, at my inventions 
CoFlow providing DJ's with turntable weapons 
Snatch that, Disco Daddy, father pops grand shh 
Eliminate pretense, turn rocks to sand 
You're rockin low budget Doctor Who special effects 
And that's half-baked, you never get a buck when you act 
E-L dash, P is servin, we smash 
Be a bootleg, and buildin up a fat nest egg 
I say fuck you, it's easy, say it again FUCK YOU 
Love love to rock bottom beats for the flicks 
To hibernate and syncopate but I'm still in the mix 
One of the many young policin breathers knockin out sequence 
Life's a L-O-T-T-O, carry a switch for self-defense 
Rappers try to front, but when I rhyme, where that beef went? 
If I'm just a reflection then I'm takin over mirrors 
Woo lock to mack cornum status, maybe that's clearer 

See what I'm saying? See what I'm saying? 
It's just the chorus, it's just the chorus 
It's till infinity, CoFlow shit, and that's it 
I rock prisms in different downtowns 
Tainted blood donor, bustin melodies around sound 
Left-wing extremist, hip-hop militia 
Bitches suck the penis competition call me Mister 
When I Collude, with Mr. Len it's brainfood, strictly 
Never again I let a record label trap me 
Try to clap me, with paperwork that leaves me empty 
Gas me to diss me, I swear to God you'd have to kill me 
Turpentine FDA approved tactics 
Styles invade for thin skinned rappers I bust scholastics 
Sixteen-oh-four mackie plus 
Leave you in the dust, bustin them ?try move for Jus? 
Ninety degrees is CoFlow, runnin interference 
MC's they bite my shit, but I don't give em sample clearance 
Hell, I put my shit out even if I have to sell 
Like a bucket of herbs before a pressing, oppressing 
But somewhat excessive, sexually suggestive 
I can suck a cookie out of pussy, no question 
Back off, deadly like cigarettes and black coffee 
Long as I got lungs and a knot you can't stop me 

It's till infinity 
CoFlow shit 
KnowhatI'msayin, check it out, check it out 
MC's is like livin in breakbeat hell 
You try to knock me off the ladder kid the fatter I swell 
It don't matter turnin liquid into wine by design 
Not sayin I'm Je-sus, the holy buck, with a halo 
Just an urbanite riding the train till I hit paydirt 
Smoke bones that's in a CoFlow tracks and like max 
That's my flavor, experimental behavior ?by scientist? 
Got props from Brooklyn Hasidic Jews to Queens Zionists 
The Manhattan/New Jersualem type connection 
Mork in erection, fiendin out for female affection 
My style is one whole piece, your shit is just the Cliff Notes 
Eminent plays chronic, MC's pneumonic 
You're buggin now fuck that, radio wack reconvene 
I sign for my condition, Company Flow vaccine 
Indelible MC's, choice top status 
Krazy Kings, from juvenile techniques to manhood 
I make my own grain and go against it 
Pissin on authority, dropped out of school, for seniority 
To do this hip-hop shit, but resonate classic 
Pops wasn't around so I'm a secondhand bastard 
Hypothesis simple, the earth is my pimple 
Pocket the extra cash then CoFlow multplying like triplets 
It's senseless, leaving rapeprs elderly and defenseless 
Going into details is worthless, fuck it 
I got your surplus, as long as there'll be peons on the surface 
I claim my outpost and boast, cause I deserve to 
Swerve to, miss the link, colder than a fetus on a hockey rink 
You think not what? Best be he not 
For ? and not givin up a little somethin at the weed spot 
Bigg Jus what's the verdict on this beat (that shit is mad hot) 
Give a whistle if you hear this, can't best me 
Try to keep my lyrics short and fat like Joe Pesci 
God bless me 
 
Know what I'm saying, till infinity 
Still working out the bugs 
It's gonna be on though 
MC's can't fuck with me, CoFlow shit

The hope  in a dark universe chasing shadows 
Into the burning season  slay to a sunk pharaoh 
Icon  holding a diamond encrusted Jesus 
Please  stop check and  suck my rated 50 are in these chromosomes hell 
Still these guns blaze on a ten hour swing shift 
Who I had thoroughly wanted to rip shit 
Grab the rags and towels and swing their caps back 
See lab bomb autopsy report, terrorist type of 'tack 
The lifeline intertwined with true belief got distorted 
Caught it late night on Telemundo, Night Court it, teleport it 
Spotted in boot camp dishing out an ass whpping, bad decision 
Align astrologically to ensure global time positioning 
Take aim, blast government conspiracies out the frame 
Excuse me, El Diablo, excuse me 
The worldwide be	-boy exhibit is now closed 
Widen your distribution of nitrogen, swing nightsticks on patrol 
The Bad Lieutenant, digital chaos out of control 
Deep in a swampland, the killer's out officially financed 
Graffiti crazed individual rock steady in all his fury 
Backspinnin on these crabs, signed sincerely yours truly 
Flow some mo' Co shit (repeat 6X) 
Verse Two: El-P 
Who disperses poisonous crackers with gem tones 
One minute of verses the beats to spot zones, angled out 
Murder kill def sucky bitch cock and that's your best shot 
Strictly Freudian the way I see another crab frontin within the 
inkblot 
Like that dung beetle squirmin around in the residue of my math 
The design burnt into the support beam and contorted into a love mode 
Seemingly gave the whole squad the Hiroshima for preference 
For using my blueprints as a point of reference 
Co Flow can only exist in your void which is closed in the internet 
Trying to match definitions to the words with which I taught 
See technically you're not the germ it's your sperm that's the weapon 
I fear ducks fertilizin and teachin their seeds all the half steppin 
Spawnin little replicate idiots, so I madly touch pressure points 
badly 
Sadly but it's my duty 
When amnio-belief bust down, turn around for the script that I falcon 
See that with that you drown, eerily... 
Under the bridge micronautics 
Pop is pure but then the septic system bubble up through the artists 
454 Fahrenheit bombers we are 
As long as I can see the North Star 
Cross minds but don't try to hide 
the use of a gun as an extension of the penis 
When Yin collides with Yang you see me burn into the Phoenix 
Blinded don't test me I already received my G.E.D. 
Scored in the top .5 percentile in the country, quite easily 
Record mode set up the EQ for minus 
Infect it like the germs that metamorph up in your sinus 
As with this slang was born a new Sodom 
I be a Deep Blue def subtle breath control that Kasparov pack 
The acidic 32nd contact 
While snakes try to scream out what a friend is 
Then lick off like Mendendez 
With only a stick so I can blood just bricklay a biggie thick set 
aside suit 
Homicide sad times settle into entropy 
I El-Venom, patchwork I've sewn the last stitch X-axis 
Tilted on the side where they coulda been residing amongst freaks 
Company Flow, kill informational leaks

",Info Kill II
Company Flow,"At night I cover my ears in tears 
The man downstairs must have drank too many beers 
But one day you'll pay 
Doomed to this kid that you fueled with anger actions 
Disgust mostly sick most  never have satisfaction 
Till your bones melt high incident clips and crumple zones 
Hold a fix on you eternal  intruder interrupting my zone 
Dwell the matter I must follow  why you proposed only the lonely know 
Swallowed my mother when she was hollow 
Who can blame a woman like her, singular parent 
One love already dissolved and the solution left polluted 
Two kids with a father who broke out as resoluted 
So suck it she needed love and you provided false clout 
Stomping on the bottom man and I wish she just walked out 
Knew you was jacked as a stepfather, bit my tongue on the issue 
Next to stormy weather and forced tolerance but secretly vexed 
Wish I would have spoke on it but why deny the bliss 
Mom's with a new husband casting needles puncture pressure 
Briefly lifted the guilt from a divorce snuffing her pleasure 
Now you're all up in the family tree, come broken nuclear 
With termites corroded in your veins and elected to drown the pain 
But the pain couldn't quite die with a thrown back whiskey sour 
Puritan, crushing Moms between rocks for at least an hour 
Until the day I die 
Until the day I die
That's why 
At night I cover my ears in tears 
The man downstairs must have had too many beers 
Now every night of my life he beats his wife 
[Until the day I die] 
Until the day I die 
Timepiece must of read early morning at least 
So I lay death's cousin, woken by the sonics of the beast 
That somewhere deep beneath me a fracture had seized at my neck 
Breath was it, a flag that marked the end of my peace 
Conference of the birds I heard my mother dove cry 
Not absurd just routine I'd learned 
Just keep my fucking grill locked and hope the entropy stops me process 
Stepfather's got to fight verbally when his liver's soaked 
And products come in bottles stuck with drunken last nerve up too close 
But I couldn't sense the distinction from the other nights' livest wires 
Ceremony's sparked again a dry one in comparison to this one 
Handing crutches to my psyche, I was tripping 
Huddled up clutching sis I think I heard a dress ripping 
I should of reacted to that 
But I didn't know the extent, please 
You could of caught him in time 
Yeah, that thought's occurred to me constantly 
Now I've been digging my head and I don't know what he wants from me 
Until one of us is dead I suppose 
That's why 
At night I cover my ears in tears 
The man downstairs must have had too many beers 
Now every night of my life he beats his wife 
[Until the day I die] 
Until the day I die 
Until the day I die 
Much more than abrupt I heard the silence erupt 
But it was just a touch of tough love that I heard from above 
The calm and the climate confused me 
The dawn was a floozy 
Barely risen but still beckoning to me 
The song of the night's events amused me, morbidly 
In a petrified state I wait, to Deadwood on duty 
Just tempers flared I figured woozily 
When all is dead and done a pair is just as fucking happy as they choose to be 
Now off to where the wild things dwell for shuteye 
The prospect bored me, awakened by the step sounds coming towards me 
A quick glance at my mom's darkened silhouette in the hallway assured me 
So I sunk with the hope that hibernation would cure me 
And slept my last sleep while I counted clone sheep 
And dreamt about nothing for the last time ever 
The ignorance was blissful just a recollection 
Of the gift of innocent times from a merciful deception 
Woke to hazy landscapes to find my world defied the laws my mind mandates 
Patching jugulars with Band-aids 
The turn on you laid well above my bed 
Were here and only barely through the shock of what her broken face told me 
You should have known what happened 
I was young and oblivious 
He almost killed your mom 
If I knew I could have done something 
You'll never see him again 
Yeah but I see him every night 
And cover my ears in tears as he beats his fucking wife 
At night I cover my ears in tears 
The man downstairs must have had too many beers 
Now every night of my life he beats his wife

[El P]
I'll do the simple shit; strike harder than Hoffa.
El the maladjusted, MC Funcrusher.
Massive; a sign for my condition, automatic.
Goldstar connect thoughts; get jostled at your position.
Listen, abort mission without further discussion.
Dual personality, half me.
Doc Jekyl when I burn your paragraph down to a haiku.
So Tootsie Roll, motherfuck, back to your seat, 'cause I don't like you.
I got a hundred beats; all nicer than your joint.
Karaoke MC's need not receive G's; that's the whole point.
Be out within' the crowd; get open like herpes simplex sores
On vexed pussy; found that I put more crush on crews than Jets.
You're just that simple, plus overfronted, but that's the status.
Cold caught my shit; you better not sit, so stop the madness.
With hip-hop guidelines, I state I never liked authority.
When sales control stats I place no faith in the majority.

Auto matic, just for my people.
Auto matic, just for my crew.
Auto matic; if you're wack then you'll get.
Knocked out of the box, and you'll deserve it too.

I analyze; people call me El, so, son, catch it.
MC's be disillusioned as hell; them can't hack it.
I'm a knock you out your tax bracket.
Slipped into the wrong hands; the mental barbarian
Stay-freshed in Ziplock; money plot hatcher.
How the fuck you gonna bring a Go-cart to the Grand Prix? Hee, hee. 
Laughter, enter for irreconcilable disaster.
I'm a protect mine like a Japanese fighting sticks master.
Aim; pierce your vital nerve; the bloody conquest.
Rappers they be like, bro, I sunk your Battleship.
Ultra-magneto; burnin' pee burns my credo.
Mad men cry like when you realize you got a shirt full of infrared
Dots, plus I'm scopin' at this bitch; be prepared for the mental headshots.
When the CoFlow leave the room we takin' mics, bitches, and boom.

[BMS]
Now the mint and governor get paid, collectin' off raids.
All the cash that was made from a brother, New York Undercover.
Don't love her; still I'm SuperHun.
Rhyme styles monstrosities; fools never stoppin' me.
I swat MC's quite easily, Dunn.
Imitate styles; most complain you can't begin to express.
Elevate off this, nine times to your brain.
Makes your mind manifest; shit's hopeless.
Stop, stop the nonsense; this could not accomplish.
Low pro interactive; go open carsnatchin'.
CoFlow, by all means necessary, packin' rhymes is automatic.
Check the barrel circumference; who done it?  Confirm it; sewers done run it.

But still ill, and Sugarhill, to the fullest extent.
Tactic G represent, C-4 blowin' up,
Like the doors and this president.  (Dead presidents.)

I'm gettin' fresh for my freeform .
All hold heart rocks down when I'm turnin' veterans to greenhorn.
Beat it; make a bee-line; be lax or you'll be outed.
Spit words that's really cold, pinchin' lymph nodes, El.
The inconvenience to your master plan fell; your shit's abyssmal.
Decimal point zero for the judge burnin' rhyme books.
Fuck basic, iambic pentameter just dissolves,
So I'll say fuck you; suck your marrow like a chicken wing from pluck you.
Location I'll rock like Zeke, calamity.
What's your composure?  Shoot sex like Vanity; it's over.
Done it again; brainstorm slice in your direction.
Cut the belly of your block; open over to C-Section.
Death callin' one for the dysfunctional son.
Trapped in my digital domain... (The El to the P.) 
Yo, fuck rappers that freak a fable; phony will make them fall out.
Frequencies painful; run 'em as sonar; CoFlow's the callout.
You're misaligned, I turn benign breaks into malignant.
Knock 'em out the box; capture they flag and kick they can in.
Badlands live one down the information highway.
Write a rhyme in braille; send a fuckin' battle to your e-mail.
Yes, once again empty MC's we have had here; for those
Fortunate enough to feel this; blessed number one, ichiban,
Numero uno crew; track runner, stun gunner, plus vocal.
Freak show performance.
Company Flow rockin' shit from the intro to the outro.
Nevertheless I must digress for the master;
The walking FreshFest MC's pure when in soil,
Yet shallow when the bank roll.
The independent representation of what MC's can and should be.
Judge, prosecution, defendant, and jury.

Geah, your ass is out, Eiht wrote a-
Nother funky rap about your jealous conflict
How you diss C.M.W, boy, you ain't said shit
Your senses should tell ya: kick it, don't be a hero
Equipped to whip is Eiht, unlike a zero
I gotta hitcha, or get witcha
Sit down, clown, I commence to paint a picture
Hm, it's kinda funny, but yet somewhat amazing
Take you serious? I think about it while I'm blazing
Only then will my reaction show
How I chill and let my tempo flow
Too sorry is the name for your rap
No competition, dissin, boy, you need to be slapped
Eiht ain't no punk, so learn it quick

You tossed our records, think I tossed right back

In better words, you go down like King Cooper
So stop your little dissing, saying that I can't handle
I put your lights out, you have to rap by a candle
Go head up punk, or sell out, I know you must've
Heard the word, new jack, I'm not a buster
Always down to bust a record, a party, know what I mean?
But unlike yourself, sucker, I do it for cream
So period, end of story, don't even bore

Fool, you fucked up smooth tryin to diss
A victim of a violent crime on the list
So wake up and smell the bud', you little pupils

To leave your crew in suspense, that's why you feel dumb
Impossible, and yet unwise to disguise

Unknown and Slip is hip, look in the mirror
The call for the wanted posse is demandin
As I release rhymes so outstandin
Don't stop at nothin, cause I got much heart
Just do the E a favor, and punk, don't start

Gossiping about the latest Compton killin
Brothers is deep, and no time to sleep
The Boys on the tip, and they trying to creep
Had a G-ride, so I suggest that we punch it
Grover was driving, and doing about a hundred
Hit a corner on the plata. Checked the spot
Seen the P.D. lights. Down the spot was hot
Ed Dog was cuffin'. Threw in the back
Chiste and Lil' Rock jacked for selling that crack
E, man, hit the fence. Yelled out, ""See you later!""
Shark then pulled out the big blue blazer
Dookie and Boo didn't know what to do
Jumped in the car with D.T, bumpin' CMW
Hit a you around the corner. Did it work? I wonder
C.P.D. on my ass, and they burnin' rubber
 Didn't want to be like Brother and Fly: locked up
So I downed the Bird that was still in my cup
Parked the G-ride, and I started to bail
'Cause my trip was to home, not the County Jail
Police swooped. By the time the Boys was near me
Go Go fled 'cause the homie was kind of leary
I wasn't sweating shit, 'cause they had nothing on me
Bam looked bag. They were named. Now his Pony
They peeped out the pager. Said, ""How much did it cost?
By the way MC Eiht, where's the dope you toss?""
(Eight): ""Me sell dope? Um sir. I'm a rap singer
Won't go down like the Compton gang banger.""
They ran a warrant check. I must have had good luck
But the homie who ran. Mmmm
One Time gaffled him up

(Chorus 3x: Scratched by DJ Unknown)
Get your ass in the car.
Ho hold it now.
Keep still boy. No need for static.

Get your ass in the car.
You're coming with us!

(Verse 2):
Had a show to do on a Thursday night
Me, Chill, Slip, and Tom rolling in Big White
Loaded as fuck, bumping ""The Cactus.""
I hope the Stoney Boys don't try to jack us
Gas tank was loaded, and so was the E
Kind of buzzed of the sack of the good E.T.
Chill was bustin' raps about the good ol' days
Switching to another form about how he get paid
Just then the Boys came behind the truck
Tom looked out and said, ""What the fuck?!?!""
A motor cycle cop riding hard on the tip
Had to clown his ass once. N' said, ""This ain't no C.H.I.P.S!""
Homie had a warrant for a D.U.I.
And in my pocket was a fat sack of Chocolate Thai
Damn! (damn)
Now it's time to get nervous
Starey Clown caught back em
And they was fixing to serve us
Dumb Dumb walked up and started asking for names
They he peeped me out and asked what's the gang I claim
The fact that I'm black is the reason you jack me
I've got to gang bang 'cause of the hat and khaki's
If I was in the hood, the dummy wouldn't have found me
He said, ""Shut the fuck up 'fore you're headed for the County!""
He was already late. The fools had they nerves
To have us sitting contest on the edge of the curb
Twas showt, shorter that showt. What can I say?
""Keep on talking. Go ahead. Make my day
He started to acting tough n' Chill thought he was bluffin
But in a second or two, the Boys started the cuffin
Bud in our pockets. Brew in our cups
No time for explanations. One Time gaffled us up

(Chorus 3x: Scratched by DJ Unknown)
Get your ass in the car.
Ho hold it now.
For when? For what?
I ain't guilty!

Get your ass in the car.
You're coming with us!",One Time Gaffled 'Em Up

Pulled up bumping the mutherfucking Cube.
Walked in the door seen my face on the tube.
Stood there and tripped off the gaffle video.
It went off, I looked up and said its time to go.
Girl said she was hungry so I tried not to be evil.
I said you got a choice, Louie's burgers or Golden Eagle.
She started biffing, I said bitch i ain't playing.
It ain't like your my woman, why'knowutumsaying?
Girl got the grub and it was off to the liqour store.
I said what kind of drinks, she said go with the 4-0
I said what? grab one or two? 
She said get two, one for me and one for you.
Got her to the room and she started to guzzling
the forty, hit the blunt and the bitch was buzzing.
that's when I told her it was time to come to Eiht.
And I was about to bounce, rock, roll, and skate.
Got inside, got to spanking on that ass.
Her engine got hot, she start moving real fast.

I grabbed them shoulders, said 'geah, can I kill it.'

Geah, still breaking them off, why'knowutumsaying.

That made it easier to get her head ducking.
Told her we was fixing to have this little get together.
She started dragging about the movies, I said hmm whatever.
Told her I pick her up about 9:30.
I called up this other bitch, ""damn Eiht you dirty""
Pulled up bumping, like flaunting my riches.
Ran out about I'd say 8 different bitches.
They hung on my window, leaned on my hood, Sat in my seat.
Got the raise in my meat.
I just had to know if they was skeezing.
I ran the line, 'what's the plan for the evening'.
Right then, yo, the shit was all plugged.
And after the night was over she'd be dug
out by a brother who wasn't saying a word.
Cause what I needed to say was already heard.
Picked the bitch up and went straight to get the liquor.
Then right back to my pad, so I could smooth dick her.
Told her a drag, it went straight to her head.
Cause if I said I just want to fuck my drag would be dead.
She downed one cup, then 2 then 3.
And Eiht was ready to shake the [huh?]
And while I'm in it, I'll ask her can she feel it?
Damn, can I kill it?

Suckers got static, here goes the G-A-T.
So take a step up and play for the rhythm.
>From Compton boy, and this is what I give em.
A blast from the gat just for talking that junk.
Feel like handling the business might smoke the punk.

And don't be no hero like in the western days.
At sundown, you'll press your luck and try to shoot me.
Grab your davey Crocket, I'll grab my gangsta Uzi.
And after all that, you'll still be R.I.P.
If you fuck with me...Fool there's your def wish.

Compton's Most Wanted,"Picture a nigga on the warpath, 
And he'll spread terror through the city and leave a trail of blood baths.
And to those that know, he's not a phony.
But tonight he'll get his vengeance on the fool who killed his homey.
Don't give a fuck, he'll take you smooth on out.
Cause the hood is where its good is what its about.
Geah. Don't want to squable, through down or even kick him.
Just pull the fucking trigger cause to him your just a victim.
Jumped in the car, ash traces of dub.
Hit a couple of corners and pulls up at the bud
spot where its hot. Yeah boy he knows it.
But before he does the killing, he's got to get loaded.
Throws up the set, then he bones out quick.
Then he spits at a bitch just for riding his dick.
Now he's at the curb and yeah he gots the feeling.
He tells his homey, ""G lets get ready for the killing.""
Little did he know Miss Daisy's in the kitchen
Standing cooking chicken, 9 started clicking.
Ran up to the back of the house like releigh races.
Just like a train robbery, bandanas on their faces.
He here's this fucking little voice in his brain.
And its saying don't kill, we're all in the same gang.
He tells it back, that ain't the gang I'm in.
Because the gang I'm in is like in it to win.
So he killed off the sucker right there he didn't stop.
Ran through the rooms and went pop pop pop.
The explenation for this, he must was crazy.
I guess that's why he had to driveby miss daisy.

[And now the driveby].....[Say hello to my little friend.]
[You die mutherfucker...] 

Check out the high rolling, young balling, pimp mack daddy.
Drive a 190E, ain't got no time for a caddy.
He got snaps because he jacked a nigga.
But he fucked up smooth and didn't pull the trigger.
Now there's a contract for your head on a platter.
If there's somebody with you they'll kill them too it don't matter.
Now your laying low at your girlfriends crib.
And your thinking of the shiesty shit that you did.
Now you got balls and you pull another jack.
Another and another, your pockets on fat.
don't give a fuck if he spends time in jail.
Just load up the 9 with the hollow point shells.
So nows he's on a mission, to kill or be killed.
Since somebody's got to do it and the shoes are to be filled.
So now its 12 o'clock, and its time for a jack.
Not even thinking it was time for payback.
And yeah you spot a fool who'll get the rag pack.
Rolling close behind while you blase a 20 sack.
He stops at a light on Elandra and Central.
Jump the fuck out put the gun to the window, its kinda simple.
But you know how it deal, and what the fuck was in store.
It was the same punk who you tried to jack before.
And he won't give up shit. Point blank hesitation.
Innocent Miss Daisy at the mobile gas station.
His 9 went click, your 9 went clack. 
Miss Daisy tried to run but got a shell in her back.
The explanation for this he must was crazy.
I guess that's why he had to driveby Miss Daisy.

I don't dance because that just ain't my style.
Portray the prep and act so buck wild.
And when the Eiht bails to these local clubs
my first inspiration is to just get buzzed.
Dress code inforced, just like I said I ain't frightened.
The homie dressed up is a brand new shirt and dickies.
So I spot a female up to par, jump out my car
and head straight for the bar.
As I proceed I got a shove in the back. 
Turned around and said ""black, you hopping like your on crack""

All that sweating dried out your curl.
Too much ants in your pants.

Downed the last of the Cogniac.
Eiht was ready to attack.
Grabbed the girl I was peeping.
She was 5000 baby, I said ""baby, ain't no sleeping.""
Get my gangsta slide to the middle.
That pumped her up I seen her earings jiggle.
Right then the crowd got crazy.
But the DJ got kinda lazy.

Compton's Most Wanted,"Compton is the place that I touched down.
I opened my eyes to realise I was dark brown.
And right there in the ghetto that color costs.
Brothers smothered by the streets meaning we're lost.
I grew up in a place where it was go for your own.
Don't get caught after dark roaming the danger zone.
Cause it was hell at the age of 12
as my Compton black brothers were in and out of jail.
Years went on, I played with the school crap.
Made it half way, it didn't pay, so I said fuck that.
Cause right then it was the cash I was after.
The street had a beat so I was caught up in the rapture.
It said sell, sell, sell.
And after that it was jail, jail, jail.
I also kept a nine as my toy.
I was only 15, so boys will be boys.
So by 16 I was hip to the groove
and fucking any stupid black bitch that move.
And on top of that I was down for the hood.
If you from Compton you know that the hood is where its good.
So load up the gatts and its down the avenue.
I'm kinda fucked up so I guess I'll kill a few
punk niggas trying to scheme on my tip.
Geah I'm selling the cavi and I'm checkin a grip.
But now the high rolling days been cancelled.
Damn, they kidnapped my homie for ransom.
But that's an everyday thing that's what the news play.
One times can't do shit so why the fuck do you pay.
And this goes out to all those niggas that know what's popping.

Drug wars, you got the pushers and the pimps
and to make things worse you got the bustas and the wimps.
Gank bitches trying to scheme on my money.
Sucker punks jack, now ain't that funny.
But I'm a young nigga, with a respectable rep.
But my brothers gangbanging, I guess I'll follow in his footsteps.
Claiming a set, jacking a brother,
beating a bitch, you diss the hood I'll put you 6 feet under.
Who gives a fuck if its wrong, no time for thinking.
Just think of the bud and the 8-ball drinking.
So now its time to show my loyalty.
Shoot up my enemy territory.
And my brothers got my back they won't trip.
And I'm in it to win it so I won't slip.
It was like we had a gangbang rally.
A thousand mutherfucking thuggish niggas in the alley.
So while we waited to peel a cap
the suckers crept, damn, shot me in the back.
so now I bail in a wheelchair, no more stomping.
Raised in Compton.

geah, why'knowutumsayin? 
MC Eiht and Compton's Most Wanted putting niggas to rest.
Side by each, why'knowutumsaying? Putting em down.

So why in the fuck should I sleep when they creep

And the fools won't give a chance to explain.
If you're from Compton, you either sell dope or gangbang.
Yo those fools on my dick still trying to jack me.
I guess because I sport a hat and the khaki's.
And if my cars on hit then I'm a roller,
Bust a you, hit the sirens and pull me over.
Run a make on my plates, fool they legit. 
Another day for this punk ass bullshit.
I was lucky, I threw the blunt in my sock.
The first thing they say, who's got the gat who's got the rocks?
I said please officer, I'm a rap singer.
Boy you from Compton you gots to be a banger.
where's your hood, what's your set, throw up your gang sign.
I takes my hands off the hood and says I ain't got time.
He's says park it fool times is wasting.
I said fuck you, black leather glove slapped my face then
I was pissed, it was rough, my hands was cuffed.
If I told them they stink they'd throw my ass in the clink.

All that time, fools didn't even find my strap.
But every day its the same shit happening, yo.
Watch your back one times still gaffling, geah.

Off to the kick it spot to make an end.
Early in the morning so my day can begin.
I seen the fool that tried to double cross me.
I beat the punk down smooth cause I'm the boss, E.
2 niggas rolling, in hats, inside a cadillac.
We start to blaze up the mutherfucking 20 sack.
We rolled the windows up to get that contact.
One times seen the smoke they pulled a smooth jack.
On top of that I was bumping big noise.
It was the fucking CHP boys.
I didn't like those punk fools one bit.
Cause they be popping that KKK shit.
So I kick back and played with the routine.
and told the grand dragon I was 17.
Tell the police the truth then how the fuck that sound?
Cause if I told him the truth then I'd be county bound.
So I play with the routine, comma. 
While he say, hand over the marijuana.
I said officer, you must be joking,
that was a cigarette I was smoking.
So I sat with my but to the ground.
And kept on thinking would the fool beat me down?
They didn't find the gatt, it was a miracle.
But they still toed my mutherfucking vehicle.
I might as well have packed a strap and.
Get rid of all these one times gafflin.

Gotta blast another brother trying to scheme on my stack.
For me to be a busta, oh no.
Police is hunting a brother like an animal.
So I play my cards right, watch my back.
Because the enemy is scheming, trying to kick a rat pack.
Straight up, a gangsta, ain't got time for faking.
Label me a pusher, dead presidents I'm making.
A brother who's young, got the neighbourhood sprung.
Police riding my tip, if they catch me I'm hung.
But no, I don't sleep as they creep. Take a peep out the scene,
cause they trying to stop the flow of my green.
So I keep stepping, and bailing hard because a brother is up on it.
Catch me if you can cause fool, Eiht is wanted.

I lace up my kicks, because a brother's on the run.
Chase me down with a gun, because my lyrics weigh a ton.
Now I'm sweating cause you're sweating me big time.
Hang me up by a rope for my murder rhyme.
No shorts given, that's how I'm living in the 91.
Slide my car in, and smoking with my Mike gun.
pop off 2 lyrics so they can slack up.
If it gets too deep Mike's got the back up.
Packin' tools, droppin' fools, I'm from Compton
so that should be your first rule.
Here comes the pick of the weak, so don't sneek.
If you do, Eiht'll take 2 to your cheek.
So don't get uptight if you a victim.
Got a gang of gangsta rhymes so let me kick em.
Geah, I can't be stopped, cause I'm up on it.
And a brother like Eiht's still wanted.

So now I break faster, not because I want to, cause I got ta.
Now your homies after me because I grabbed my mike and shot a-
nother sucker dead, lyrics straight to your head.
Cannot bite, no. The Compton cyco.
Quick on the gank, so you might get shanked.
And I don't need a gatt just to jack your bank.
Another stick-up kid just got crazy.
Try to double cross the Eiht you'll be pushing up daisies.
Or you can get the backwash 
from the 40 that's poured on the ground, so I clown.
So your mad, but your bad and you press your luck.
But you still want to nag, yeah you'll get stuck.
So who's got the Compton funk?
And it's illegal if you bump it too loud in your trunk.
So now you know that Eiht's your top rap dealer.
But you a punk ass New Jack squeeler.
that's why I'm wanted.

Tha odds against me. So now its time to break.
Seconds tick off the clock so I don't fake.
I gots to keep on steppin, don't run outta breath.
Cause if I slow down punk it might spell death.
I confuse the mark, throw him off the trail.
This ain't no picnic punk you picked hell.
Better known as Rambro, not afraid.
Mike T starts the gatt, Eihts a hand grenade.
And who's got the 411?
Just can't do me punk your getting done.
Eiht is the nigga eating them up.
Yeah that's my cue so I start kicking but.
And you don't want to witness the Compton rage.
Trapped just like a rat in a snake cage.

Stroll to her car and played like I was wit it.
Half a blunt in my mouth and she asked could she hit it.
Handed her the blunt as I commence to start to lean.
So I could peep out the scene.
Fat links around the neck by the dozen.
She's giggling to much, naw don't tell me that she's buzzing.
The perfect opportunity.
And when she wakes up in the morning she'll be hating E.

Another punk bitch I pimped like a hoe.
Mmm I don't think you sorry clowns want to see me.

Spent half of my life in L.P.
Geah, now I'm out and I'm ready to sweat

Nigga, stay clear of the gun blast.
If you thinking about ducking you better duck fast.
Oops, too late you got popped in the process.
Another point for the hood, one laid to rest.
Like a cannibal, I want to see meat.
Killing punk fools from the wrong side of the street.
Me and the homies rolling 4 deep.
Niggas on the run all strapped with fucking guns.

Fuck you or love you, how should I call it?
And its true, all you say is do
for you. and If you got a kid I guess I gotta do them too
Wrong, ain't no rings on your finger
You've mistaked Eiht as some punk love singer
Saying your down with me, and only me
but I'm hearing your fucking the neighbourhood G. Little Skee
Ain't nuthin popping
No snaps get spent until the panties start dropping
I guess a hoe is a hoe
but for you to gank me? Bitch, Eiht don't think so
Your nothing but a user
raised in the Compton streets girl you's a.....bitch

I met you when I was rolling, you and your home girl strolling
Flagging me down, I guess I'll stop for this sorry clown
Another stupid one, here we go again
Cleared my throat and said ""uhmmm where's your boyfriend?""
She tried to check me and say, ""I'm independent""
I said ""Girl Eiht ain't stupid, somebodies getting in it.""
""And if you got a man"" I said "" he's shorter than a midget.
""So come on this side and rush the 7 digits.""
I said ""what's the plan?"" She said ""I don't know call me later""
I said ""I'll call you later, you crooked alligator.""
Spent all my snaps that night, just to make you holler
I come home with a dollar
So one day I decide to make a surprise creep
You and another nigga hugged up in the middle of the street
Damn...Girl...Shit.. You's a.....Bitch

Now what should I do? Keep my cool, step back and clown?
Or go to jail for like months for beating you down?
But I can't afford that bad rap
cause my rep is too big to be caught up in that crap
You stupid little skeezer
In fact I'll call you a bitch, in other words a dick teaser
And its my style you cramp
You say pay for the play. I'll pay for it with a food stamp, tramp
Geah, and that's a fact
Whatever I'm giving your ass bitch I'm taking it right back
And in this rap I'll kick it
about the girls that's sly, slick, and wicked

Straight thumpin' up in your woofers to make the whole street look up
You're shook up, wonderin why we got the fuckin' hook-up
And thinkin' why we got the whole damn studio booked up
Droppin' 'em bombs, killin' car alarms
Got them niggas on stuck, hoes ready to fuck

Watch me handle this, player-haters trip on me get bucked quick

Leave a pipe bomb and a fuck you note
Hallucinations of seein' lynched bodies burnin'
And all the po-po had faces like Mark Furhman

So peep the game from an old school G you know so well
The east bay gangsta, leaving caution tape and faces pale
I bails on a full moon like the 12 o clock 
Neighborhood watch scared to look and see who on the block
Just fed a rally's, no po-po come around here

You need to get at me, I'm the G
Locin and provokin dips blocks with cavi
Search a ki' cross the street and smash out
The '63 bounce back to the same route
You fools best get the fuck off my cold tales
Gang tales of how the fuckin dead body smells
Late night horror shows in jail cells
Represent where you from no one to tell
Life ain't nuthin but the hood and snaps
Hoodrats carry work with straps in they laps
Quarter niggas with nicknames play craps
Enemies tryin to cross the front line
Get capped nuthin but escape, uh
Second flat my gat let loose like 'Rat-a-tat-tat'
The underground hero guess y'all is back
My custom, my khaki suit and a blue cap, automatic   

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
I make it difficult for a nigga to find me
Crazy-ass Hoo-Bangin G's behind me
You're fucked up for that last time fo' sho'

Quick to hit out like [name] the street king
Shells ricochet up your body, ping ping
Eazy don't come to [??] pound

Ya know cash runs everything around a hoe
Greedy as fuck, a chicken tryin' to scheme on chickens
Greedy as fuck, to pay the bitch, she keep on lickin'

Shakin' that ass with the jiggle and twitch
In the club bustin', knowin I'ma want that bitch
You ain't seein a nigga ghetto rich
Ghetto fab, ghetto star
Hop off stage, ???bless thou??
No questions asked, that's the role you play
You hit me up on Monday
Fuck the bitch anyway

Get down like you live and get down on a dime 
You bring yo' homegirl, that's fine

The owl hoots shrilly searching the dark

The battered Christian bows his head in despair
The crown of sharp thorns revealed 'neath his hair

Stands taut and painful on the pilgrim's last mile

The wolf sniffs ivory fanged he bristles up his spine
The fox smiles knowingly but dares not step out of line
Through the twisting crashing silence the broken Christian creeps
Each footstep like a thunderclap amongst the trunky deeps
No bird makes sound no creature moves to break the gripping air
And the Christian he raises his hands up to his mouth for a
Whisper he cannot dare

A misty cold sad morning greets the Christian's haggard grin

Con Hunley,"How many times have you heard someone say
""If I had his money, I could do things my way?""
But little they know that it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.

Once I was waiting in fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's game
But suddenly it happened, I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind

Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely, or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind

When life has ended, my time has run out

But yhere's one thing for certain, when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind",Satisfied Mind

I want to get out of here
Dropping out, want to shout
In despair I'm fighting
I'm living in a world filled with fear

It's in my mind, won't go away
Just like an obsession
Who are you my guest
Falling down to the abyss
Feels like I'm dreaming
But this is real, I can't escape

Secrets unknown will be revealed
I thought that all was lost
secrets unknown will be revealed
Looking into another world

Intuition telling me:
Look into the future
My hope is growing strong
Horrorstruck, go away
I can't see the daylight
The time is running away from me

Gonna be, be your friend
If you want to let me
I'm standing by a crossroad
Here I am, take me now
Into your arms I'll fall
I feel secure hiding in you

Secrets unknown will be revealed

Darkness around you
Despair surrounds
The remaining parts of your mind
Pain growing stronger
Can't take it no longer
It's tearing your soul apart

Secrets unknown will be revealed
I thought that all was lost
Secrets unknown will be revealed
I will survive I'm gonna live
Looking into another, another...

Conception,"Wave after wave is breaking on the shore
Keeping the secrets of destiny
The sun goes down
I'm trembling with wrath and awe
Am I worthy such a sight
Who I worthy such a sight
Who am I to feel joy

In lack of insight
In greed for more
Conclusions slipped my mind
The distant light is slowly fading away

Time after time
The signs have been so clear
Now there's no time for recovery
I feel a chill
I'm clutching at a clue
But the failure is a fact
Who'll save me from the night

You'll remain
You'll turn on
A solitary life
Left behind on my bare rock-face I'll watch
The Last Sunset

You will remain
Always be there
I have passed the point of no return
Long time ago

If there is a god above
Powers who have always known
Give me a reason
Am I all alone to blame
Was I meant to strive in vain
Answer my cry

You will remain
Always be there
I have passed the point of no return
Long time ago

Ibas de la mano de otro caballero
Condenada luna seguro mentía

Y el árbol se muere y el río se seca
Seguiré esperando, sola en el desierto

Tú tenías mucha razón
me hace daño al corazón
Y me muero por volver

Y volver volver volver
A tus brazos otra vez
Llegaré hasta donde estés
Yo sé perder, yo sé perder
Quiero volver, volver, volver, volver volver volver","Volver, Volver"
Concha Buika,"Lloro como el arroyo al llegar el río yo muero
Muero como el río al llegar al agua de amor yo muero
Yo hice lo que pude te ame como sabía
Y al final de todo tu amor yo no tenía
Me vuelvo al río y muero.
Cerro la puerta sin decir adiós
Nunca volví a verla nunca más volvió
Como yo te quise nadie nadie te ha querido
Insensata mía por qué te has ido
Y me dejaste sola como el mar
Yo vivo como el aire libre pero sin saber a donde va
Y nadie nadie nadie te ha querido
Insensata loca por que te has ido

Tu volverás, y cuando tu regreses amor
Veras como alguien quizo ocupar mi pobre corazon por ti y ya veras
Como tu a mi me pides perdón y yo que ya estoy loca de amor yo voy y te perdono

No eran tan falsas aquellas mentiras
Ni tan verdaderas tus verdades favoritas
No fueron tan callados aquellos silencios
No fueron tan malos algunos momentos
Si ahora te marchas vete para siempre
No te des la vuelta que las vueltas siempre duelen
Y habré la ventana que da al paraíso
Olvidame si puedes que yo no he podido

Tu volverás y cuando tu regreses amor
Veras como alguien quizo ocupar mi pobre corazon por ti
Y ya veras como tu a mi me pides perdón
Y yo que ya estoy loca de amor yo voy y te perdono, yo te perdono y tu tu

Tu volverás y cuando tu regreses amor
Veras como alguien quizo ocupar mi pobre corazon por ti
Y ya veras como tu a mi me pides perdón
Y yo que ya estoy loca de amor yo voy, yo voy y te perdono",Volverás
Concha Buika,"Uno se despide 
Insensiblemente de pequeñas cosas

Lo mismo que un árbol 
Que en tiempo de otoño se queda sin hojas

Al fin la tristeza es la muerte lenta de las simples cosas 
Esas cosas simples que quedan doliendo en el corazón

Uno vuelve siempre a los viejos sitios donde amo la vida 
Y entonces comprende como están de ausentes las cosas queridas

Por eso muchacha no partas ahora soñando el regreso 
Que el amor es simple y a las cosas simples las devora el tiempo

Demorate a ti, en la luz solar de este medio día 
Donde encontraras con el pan al sol la mesa tendida

Por eso muchacha no partas ahora soñando el regreso

Y un amanecer absurdo pero elegante
Aquella tarde de luz, sus besos hicieron diana

Recuerdo de otro amanecer 
Lindo y estúpido

Cómo era, yo ya no recuerdo cómo era
Yo he besa´o tu boca y me he perdió
Qué es lo que ha pasado
Hoy yo me pregunto cómo era
Yo ya no recuerdo cómo era 
Yo he besa´o tu boca y me he perdió
Ya no tengo ni un recuerdo de lo que he sido 
Cómo era, yo ya no recuerdo cómo era
Yo he besa´o tu boca y me he perdió

Esos bombillos de bar que fingiendo 
Ser luna de abril, iluminas mi penar
Mi penar triste y hermoso ilumina también 
El camino lento hacia una nueva luna
Que ando yo superviviente de un amor casi imposible

Arrepentida de otro amor casi impecable
De nuevo al frente de este amor casi imposible

Cómo era, yo ya no recuerdo cómo era
Yo he besa´o tu boca y me he perdió
Y ahora me pregunto qué debo hacer conmigo
Cómo era, yo ya no recuerdo cómo era
Yo he besa´o tu boca y me he perdió
Yo ya no tengo ni un recuerdo de lo que he sido
Cómo era, yo ya no recuerdo cómo era
Yo he besa´o tu boca y me he perdió
Pa´ que nadie pregunte, quisiera yo saber

Esa cruel preocupación?
Quiero por los dos mi copa alzar
Para olvidar mi obstinación

Nostalgias de escuchar su risa loca
Y sentir junto a mi boca
Como un fuego su respiración
Angustia
De sentirme abandonado
Y pensar que otro a su lado
Pronto… pronto le hablará de amor

¡Hermano!
Yo no quiero rebajarme
Ni pedirle, ni llorarle
Ni decirle que no puedo más vivir

Let the sun shine through

And a hand to help us stand
With a gentle kind of motion

Tanta sangre que se llevo el rio

No sera tan simple como pensaba

Yo vengo a ofrecer mi corazón 

Y uniré las puntas de un mismo lazo 
Y me iré tranquilo, me iré despacio 
Y te daré todo y me darás algo 
Algo que me alivie un poco mas. 

Cuando no haya nadie cerca o lejos 
Yo vengo a ofrecer mi corazón 
Cuando los satélites no alcancen

Hablo por la vida, hablo por la nada 
Hablo de cambiar esta, nuestra casa 
De cambiarla por cambiarla no mas

Conchita Wurst,"Look back to a time and the world
That I saw through the eyes of my youth
Before I was told to walk tall
To be strong, to believe in their truth
But the note that was wrong in their song
Sang of me, mine and I
And I carried it deep inside

I give it every little beat of my heart
Give it every single day that I start
To find something simple and real
Oh-oooo
I give it every little piece of my soul
Give up every single bit of control
To know how it feels to feel
Pure

They turn you around and around
Shaping phantoms and empty facades
And you keep hanging on to the worlds
Of their promises, lies and charades

I'm walking past windows
Reflections of someone like me
But I don't recognize what I see

I give it every little beat of my heart
Give it every single day that I start
To find something simple and real
Oh-oooo
I give it every little piece my soul
Give up every single bit of control
To know how it feels to feel

Like the tears streaming down from my eyes

The voices calling you from the edge.
They finally called you away,
You know I hear them too,
They're telling me to stay.

Oh Kim
Remember when
We made a million plans and we believed them.
Angry words ring in my head
I'd give every song I got in me
To get it back again.

She said, I could
She said hold on, hold out
Cause it's good.
She said it's right.
She said hold on, hold out
Cause I know that you can fight.

I know you can
You're right again.
There is an easy way
Out of this world.
I'm staying.
I wonder why?
It may be all I have,
But it's mine, it's mine.",Song for Kim (She Said)
Concrete Blonde,"I was walking down the street early this morning
Past the graveyard, voices whisper to me.
I was walking down the street, early this morning
And the silver tears of rain hung from the leaves
And I swear I heard the voices singing to me

Singing to the rhythm of the beat of my feet,
I swear I heard the voices singing to me,
Keep on, keep on, keep on.

Still in Hollywood!
Oh WOW! Thought I'd be out of here by now.
Still in Hollywood!
My, my I'm running on a wheel and I don't know why
I don't know why.

And on the bus today, I met the queen of L.A.
At least she said she was and who am I to say?
She was sixty-five and full of life,
She had purple-painted cheeks
And glitter on her eyes

And the troll on the corner, I flipped him a quarter
And he looked at me and smiled.

He wasn't abused, he wasn't confused,
He had nothing to gain and less to lose in Hollywood
Oh WOW! Thought I'd be out of here by now.
Still in Hollywood!

My, my I'm running like a rat and I don't know why
And so it's three A.M., I'm out walking again.
I'm just a spot on the sidewalk in a city of sin.
He doesn't give a fuck, he's living under a truck.
You know it coulda been me, guess it's just my luck.
But I swear I hear the voices singing to me,
Keep on, keep on, keep on.
Still in Hollywood",Still in Hollywood
Concrete Blonde,"When I've had enough
I'll get a pickup truck and I'll drive away
I'll take my last ten bucks just as far as it will go
Sometimes I'm easily fooled
I take a painful step and I get knocked back two
I do what I can and it's all I can do

But I'm true
And if I had the choice I'd take the voice I got
Cause it was hard to find
You know I've come too far to wind up right back where I started
And they tell me who I should be
I'll never let those monkeys make a mess of me
I give all I am and it's all I can do

But I'm true
One more sunset
Lay my head down

True
One more sunrise
Open my eyes up

True
And then they talk you up and then they talk you down
And you begin to doubt
Sometimes the reasons seem so very far away
But I'd stop breathing today
Cause if I can't walk proud, I'd rather walk away
I do all I am and it's all I can do

But I'm true
I'd give all I am and I'd give it to you

So true",True

And all the while behind the dancing eyes the boy crying.
He creeps like ivy on the stairs, you know I liked him then
When we would sit and drink for hours and watch the sidewalk spin.

I don't want to hear your secrets.
I don't share your pain.
I don't want to know about the wrinkles in your bed
And I don't want to know about the ghost inside your haunted head,

That's when I started running for the train.
There's nothing that you need I can't deliver,
Carry me away, carry me away.

Cause it's not true.

And any promise we make is as easy to break
As the plastic people on a wedding cake so says you
But you know, I do.

I hear you thinking,
From far away.
If ya keep lying and crying and trying and drinking,
I'm gonna carry me away, carry me away.

The days and the nights and the nights and the days
Of tossing and turning and burning and churning

It's like I'm caught in some revolving door
Over and over and over and over 

Teach me how to pray.
Tell me what to say
Help me help me help me find my way

I never could play the game
And all their faces look the same
And I won't give up

They rain a friendly storm.

Don't count on any second coming
God got his ass kicked the first time
He came down here slumming.
He had the balls to come
The gall to die and then forgive us
No I don't wonder why I wonder what
He thought it would get us
Yeah, goodbye tomorrow Wendy is going to die.

Only God says jump
But I set the time

It  was through these eyes of mine

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A-plowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the Riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yippie yi Ohhhhh
Yippie yi yaaaaay

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on hear their cry

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name

Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride

You vatos ready to ride
Where's all my motherfucking killers at
That's right, that's the way it's going down
Vatos better watch your back
Check it out

I wore a glass house to the weed spot
To pick me up a sack so I could smoke to the head
While Box got a beat at the studio that's cracking
I get at this hunny making money from dancing
Call me up when you're off, I'll be laying a verse
It's all about the feria so first thing's first
I get up in the booth and I handle mines
I'm semi-automatic homey rhyme for rhyme
And what that means is that Conejo no joke
I let the pistol barrel smoke then I take me a toke
I get blown, call shots in the zone
Where vatos play for keeps simulating Al Capone
Hit a switch and if anyone trip
See the burban right behind me, it got plenty of clips
Don't slip, I'm here to catch ya
Right between the eyes, bye bye I'ma blast ya

[Chorus]
Let's ride till we lay them down
Bang bang, everybody ese no matter what side
Let's ride till we lay them down
Bang bang, everybody ese no matter what time
Let's ride in a '63 Chevy
Ese vatos breaking down but I hold mine steady
Let's ride in a '49 bomb
I don't want to be right if the barrio's wrong

Let's ride to see the writting on the wall
Big ass blocks about fifty feet tall
Shaded in, don't know where to begin
Just know I'm in the calles trading sin for sin
Let me in, I'll tell you once that's all
Then I'm kicking in the door with my gauge sawed off
Gun point, I said she's coming with me
Get your things babygirl then jump in the Chevy
I got beats that'll make you got and drop some pills
And I don't think you want to cross me with your dope fiend skills
Camaradas from all over ese got my back
Break bread with the calles while these others get taxed
They collapse because I'm heavy in weight
I'm fresh out the joint, calisthenics, no weights
Back up, 'cause I ain't got no friends
Just twenty five riders in the streets, Dead End

[Chorus]

Vatos hold it down with the shanks and rounds
Tattoo Ink tearing up the town
Then back to the park where the gangsters hang out
Caravaning through the barrio, outsiders get ran up
Say what, there's a high risk factor
Impala '65, let's go jack these rappers
Snappers is what these broads be saying
'cause vatos from the area ese don't be playing
We be serving every night, get your plate don't wait
Got the big cooking rocks on the block that's hot
Come on dog let's go get this cash
And rob the connection, gotta be quick to blast
To my perros locked down doing time in the pen
Consider this a kite, I'll get at you tonight
And to my faction, all the fallen soldados
I came to put it down ese for all you vatos

Let's ride homies
Let's handle our business

I don't remember ever going hungry
Daddy made sure we didn't do without
I went to school with some of these fellas
They had money and I was jealous
I didn't know then what I know now
Daddy'd say you can't judge a book by looking at its cover
It's what's inside that really matters

Daddy never was the Cadillac kind
He said some things just glitter and shine
He taught us that love was the one thing money couldn't buy
Daddy never was the Cadillac kind

I left home right out of high school
Bought me a big car thought I was real cool
Cruisin' around the old neighborhood
I'd see Dad after church on Sunday
I'd say you'll have to go riding with me someday
He just said no, I never understood
He asked me how I bought it, I told him on credit
Daddy just smiled, I'll never forget it

Daddy never was the Cadillac kind
He said some things just glitter and shine
He taught us that love was the one thing money couldn't buy
Daddy never was the Cadillac kind

It took a while but now I'm grown
I've settled down with kids of my own
The more I give them
The more they want

Daddy left us last November
I don't remember him ever looking better
All laid out in his Sunday best
I'm sure instead of all the attention
All he'd of wanted was a few words mentioned
A simple man simply laid to rest
As they drove him away in that big Cadillac
With a tear in my eye I had to laugh

What kind of girl I want
I'd pick a Georgia peach or a Mississippi queen

Lord, she more than qualifies

She likes Elvis, she likes Andy
She's just as pretty as can be
She's the number one fan of
Both Graceland and Mayberry RFD

She ain't a southern belle but it's hard to tell
She's got every quality
She likes Elvis, she likes Andy

I took her home for Christmas to try some southern dishes
My mama's famous for
But mama through a fit 'cuz she wouldn't eat her grits
It was looking like the civil war

I was hoping like the devil that they would meet up in the middle
But neither one would budge
Then I heard them in the kitchen a-laughing and a-giggling
Singing hunka hunka burning love

Dear uncle Sam you got a lot to do
But I just want to have a little talk with you
You probably don't remember even who I am
But I build your cars and I till your land

While you're busy giving out all that cash
While your politicians talk all that trash
While you're busy cleaning up your own mess
Maybe you could honor my small request

Take off the tax on a cold six pack
Add another day to make the weekend last
Get your head out uncle Sam, somebody needs a hand
Toss a little bone to the working man
Toss a little bone to the working man

Make it a law that we all get a raise
And prices go a little lower every day
Where pretty women can't judge a man by his car
And if you keep your nose clean then you'll always go far

I build your bridges and I carry your loads
I move the big rigs over your roads
Hate to spend my money like I got it to burn
Seems like I ought to get a little return

Take off the tax on a cold six pack
Add another day to make the weekend last
Get your head out uncle Sam, somebody needs a hand
Toss a little bone to the working man

I hitchhiked up to Memphis, a young boy in my prime
I thought that big old city would ease my Georgia mind
After just one hour, I met this Southern girl
She said, ""They call me the Queen of Memphis""
And then she took me around the world

She showed me things, I'd never seen back there on that farm
She set my soul on fire, she completed all my dreams

So desperate, I answered an ad in the personals
Hoping to find me a date

So do you think I'll cry when she's gone

I can't believe I just didn't see
The writing there on the wall
Listening to those Barry Mannilow records
Was just one of her character flaws

Sometimes she was rude, unnaturally crude
But this good old boy let it pass
But when she cussed in front of my mom
I told she could kiss my

You probably don't remember even who I am
But I build your cars and I till your land

While your politicians talk all that trash
While you're busy cleaning up your own mess
Maybe you could honor my small request

Add another day to make the weekend last
Get your head out uncle Sam, somebody needs a hand
Toss a little bone to the working man

Make it a law that we all get a raise
And prices go a little lower every day
Where pretty women can't judge a man by his car
And if you keep your nose clean then you'll always go far

I build your bridges and I carry your loads
I move the big rigs over your roads
Hate to spend my money like I got it to burn
Seems like I ought to get a little return

You don't have to say anything, nothing, but it is advisable (but still your choice) 
to give your name, address and date of birth, and then say nothing else 

If you don't give them this you'll find they will only hold you for longer

Most people that are caught are sussed out by their own evidence 
The police are cunning but thick, don't hand it to them on a plate 
You don't have to give your fingerprints, make them apply for a warrant 
This sometimes is refused - especially if the evidence is flimsy 

Never let them take your photograph this is only compulsory after 
You have received a prison sentence, so don't let them tell you different 
You can demand suitable food; you might not get it ""keep on asking"" 
You are entitled to make phone calls but the bastards won't let you

But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin
Conjunto Alacran,"Un Se que tratas de decir 
En tus ojos puedo ver 
Lo que genero el amor ahora esta matándome 
Es el riesgo del que hable 
Un silencio entre el deseo y la fe 

Es un secreto que has de llevar 
Escondido bajo tu corazón 
Imposible de revelar 
Quedara siempre entre tu y yo 

Nadie puede prevenir 
Lo que te hace mas feliz 
Si pudiera continuar 
Seguiría junto a ti 

Se que no me perderé 
Y en otro lugar te esperare 
Un precio hay que pagar 
Aunque a veces 
Cueste mas 
No hay castigo para mi 
Que destruya lo que siento por ti",Con Olor a Hierba

Pero somos vulnerables

O acaso aquel romance que solo nombra
Cuando se pone triste con el alcohol

Tu canción tiene el frío
Del último encuentro
Tu canción se hace amarga
En la sal del recuerdo

Yo no sé si tu voz es la flor de una pena
Solo sé que al rumor de tus tangos, Malena

Te siento más buena
Más buena que yo

Que cruzan sobre el barro del callejón
Cuando todas las puertas están cerradas
Y ladran los fantasmas de la canción

En la cárcel de tu amor 
De que me hablas, de que me acusas 
Si no hay cadenas entre tú y yo

Son tus besos que me atan 
Son los celos que me matan
Lo mismo siento yo
Pero cuando como y donde 
Cuando en la calle alguien te sonríe 
Y tú correspondes

Corazón no me encadenes 
En la cárcel del amor
Corazón si aún me quieres 
Aquí me tienes, y aquí estoy yo",Corazón Encadenado

Left the girls of Tuam nearly broken hearted
Saluted father dear, kissed me darlin' mother
Drank a pint of beer me grief and tears to smother

Cut a stout blackthorn to banish ghost and goblin

When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy
Down amoung the pigs, played some funny rigs, 
Danced some hearty jigs the water round me bubblin'
When off Holyhead, wished meself was dead
Or better far instead on the rock road to Dublin

Below that old white mountain

He talked to his team of huskies
As he mushed on through the snow

Connie & Babe,"On one cloudless morning I stood on the mountain,
Just watching the smoke from below,
It was coming from a tall, slim smokestack
Way down on the Southern railroad.

It was 97, the fastest train
Ever ran the Southern line,
All the freight trains and passengers take the side for 97,
For she's bound to be at stations on time.

They gave him his orders at Monroe, Virginia,
Saying, ""Stevie, you're way behind time.
This is not 38, but it's Old 97,
You must put her into Spencer on time.""

He looked 'round and said to his black greasy fireman,
""Just shovel in a little more coal,
And when I cross that old White Oak Mountain
You can just watch Old 97 roll.""

It's a mighty rough road from Lynchburg to Danville,
And the lie was a three-mile grade,
It was on that grade that he lost his air brakes,
And you see what a jump that she made.

He was going down the grade making 90 miles an hour,
When his whistle began to scream,
He was found in that wreck with his hand on the throttle,
He was scalded to death by the steam.

Did she ever pull in? No, she never pulled in,
And at 1:45 he was due,
For hours and hours has the switchman been waiting
For that fast mail that never pulled through.

Did she ever pull in? No, she never pulled in,
And that poor boy must be dead.
Oh, yonder he lays on the railroad track
With the cart wheels over his head.

97, she was the fastest train
That the South had ever seen,
But she run so fast on that Sunday morning
That the death score was numbered 14.

Now, ladies, you must take warning,
From this time now and on.
Never speak harsh words to your true loving husband.
He may leave you and never return.",Wreck of the Old '97

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory

I heard a lady and she did deplore
She wept aloud and to me did say
Oh, my loving husband, he's so long away

With a hundred seamen he sailed away
To the frozen ocean in the month of May
To seek a passage around the pole
Where these poor sailors do sometimes go

They sailed West and they sailed East
Their ship on oceans of ice did freeze
Only the Eskimo in his skin canoe
Was the only one that ever came through

The fate of Franklin no tongue can tell
Franklin alone with his sailors do dwell

She cross the wide prairie with her lover, Ike

One evening quite early they camped on the Platte
'Twas nearby the road on a green, shady flat
Betsy, sore-footed, lay down to repose
In wonder Ike gazed on his Pike County rose

The Indians came down in a wild yelling horde
And Betsy got scared they would scalp her adored

She fought off them Indians with musket and ball

Out on the prairie one bright starry night
They broke out the whiskey and Betsy got tight
She sang and she shouted, she danced on the plain.
She made a great show for that whole wagon train

The Shanghai ran off and the cattle all died
The last piece of bacon that morning was fried
Ike got discouraged and Betsy got made
The dog wagged his tail and looked wondrously sad

They soon reached the desert where Betsy gave out
And down in the sand she lay rolling about
Ike in great terror looked on in surprise
Saying, Betsy get up, you'll get sand in your eyes
