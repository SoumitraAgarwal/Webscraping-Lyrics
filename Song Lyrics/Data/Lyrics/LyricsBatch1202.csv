Teena Marie,"Yeah, yeah, okay
I know you all hearing that beautiful voice, right?
One more time mama, one more time mama
You see I rub cash money just to see a seal original classes
Y'all might know it's Tina Marie
Who call her lady Tina La Donna, come on mama

Tell me baby, how long has it been
Here you come, and here I go again
I must admit you looking rather fly
You're a sight for sore eyes

Situation wasn't quite that cool
Seven years ago we both the fools
But I'm real enough to let you know
That I'm never gonna let you go

I'm lovin' you
I'm still loving you, baby
I'm still in love
Nobody's gonna take your place in my life
No one else but you baby

I'm lovin' you
I'm still lovin' you, honey

Teena Marie,"Today I watched your diamonds
Sparkling in the sand
God whispered to me
Everything’s alright
She’s a lot like you
That girl she’s special and
Have you forgotten,
When you was throwin' caution to the wind?

You were young and free
Three things from the wise
Hush now, let it be
If she comes back to you
You will always know
That you have to make her much more beautiful

[Chorus]

Tonight I had a movement
Here inside my hands
My tiny deserve
I don’t have all the answers baby but you
Your fruit’s like paradise
Little girl you’re special and
So young and so restless
Sweet thing makes me breathless like the wind

You were young and free
Three things from the wise
Hush now, let it be
If she comes back to you
You will always know
That you have to make her much more beautiful

[Chorus]

If she was a flower then she’d be a perfect rose
If she was a river then her heart would overflow
She sees inside of my soul
She takes me high and low
‘Cause she’s so beautiful

You’re beautiful, beautiful
You’re beautiful
You’re beautiful, baby
My baby
Beautiful
She’s something like the summer rain
She gently plays her rhythms on my window pane
My baby’s beautiful, my baby’s lovely

You’re beautiful, beautiful

I’ll give you the full authority
Call me on my unrestricted number if you like
If you want some company
I’m gon leave it up to your discretion
‘Cause it seems I’ve finally found my time
And if you wanna play with my affection
Then call me on my private line

[Chorus]
Carte blanche, baby
And this story you write
I’m gonna sign for you baby
You’ve got carte blanche, baby
You’re really bossy I know
But I love when you take control

There’s someone here who wants to handle something
Giving you complete autonomy
It seems a crime to forget all we once were
I’m gon let you handle me
I’m giving you the blank card, it’s the black card
Like the jokers, highest guaranteed
And if I let you kiss me it’s all over
The kiss would give me much more potency

Ask me what you want
And I’ll give you the world on a silver platter baby
Here I stand holding a heart so true
And if that doesn’t do
Baby, then I’ll try something new

What you wanna do?

Handle your business baby
I’m gonna let you handle me
I’m gonna let you dive beneath the hour baby
I’m giving you the power over everything

Messing with you got me a sweet tooth

Sugar daddy smooth, skin like butter scotch
Come one Talibu can I get a taste of you
I watch your every move
It's looking like you can be the Wanka to my factory
Take complete control of me
Some say you no good, rotten to the pore
That you'll only give the peace you get me running back for more
But I'm a fan of risk addicted to adrenaline
So take me on a trip and break me off a kiss

So sexy, on the ring
You'll never know how just good it feels
Talking smack you really are the truth
You give me a sweet tooth

Sie hat dieses Ding in der Hand und sie legt's nicht weg
Doch die Kleine hat noch nicht mal, dass ich leb' gecheckt
Und dabei hatt' ich dieses supermiese Hemd an
Von dem du mir gesagt hast damit krieg' ich einfach jede ins Bett

Wenn sie auf Facebook und Insta ist
Junge, glaub mir sie ist blind für mich
Snapchat, Tinder, warte irgendwas stimmt da nicht
Dicka, glaub mir sie ist blind für mich
Oh, sie ist blind für mich
Was soll ich tun damit sie mich bemerkt
Ich sag' dir sie ist blind für mich

Ah, ah, ah, ey yo Toni, Toni Macaroni
Um diese Frau zu checken brauchst du bisschen Psychologie
Letztens eine getroffen, sie war die one & only
Nur im Netz, in real klappt es sowieso nie
Was meinst du denn warum ich ständig Besuch hab'
Ich bin der Champion in meinem kleinen Computer
Also schrieb' ich sie an und hatte sie gleich
Wenn du Tipps von 'nem Mann brauchst, sag mir bescheid
Man du brauchst nur fünf Balken und Feingefühl
Genug Akku und ein bisschen Geduld man
Lass sie die geheimnisvolle Wirkung deiner Smileys fühlen
Der Scheiß nimmt dir den Druck von den Schultern
Vergiss alles was du bisher über Frauen gewusst hast
Das Ganze läuft nur nach einem lausigem Muster
Du willst sie - sie will dich
Komm mal in die digitale Welt Toni, gib dir 'nen Ruck man
Denn

Wenn du nicht auf Facebook und Insta bist
Ey, dann bleibt sie leider blind für dich
Snapchat, Tinder, Toni sei nicht zimperlich
Ist doch alles kein Hindernis
Ey, sie ist blind für dich
Ey, du musst es tun damit sie dich bemerkt
Sonst bleibt sie leider blind für dich

Eh, Carlo?
Mhm?
Sag mal, ich hatte grad dein Handy in der Hand, kann es sein dass du mit der schreibst?
Was? Mit deiner oder was?
Wie heißt'n die auf Facebook?
Ehm, Hotbabe95
Was? Warum sagst du mir das nicht?
Ey Toni, mach keinen Scheiß, ist es die?
Das ist die!
Hahaha, Ey Bruder ich hab' dir doch gesagt wie des läuft, pass auf, ich sag's dir nochmal

Wenn du nicht auf Facebook und Insta bist
Ey dann bleibt sie leider blind für dich
Snapchat, Tinder, warte irgendwas stimmt da nicht
Is doch alles kein Hindernis
Ey sie ist blind für dich
Du musst es tun damit sie dich bemerkt
Ich sag' dir sie ist blind für mich

'Ne kleine Minute
Oder ist es kompliziert
Ich glaub' ich mag dich
Spürst du denn gar nichts?

Ey yo yo, 7.12., alles Gute ?, jo

Ich war jung, frech und wild und ich trug Zeitung aus
Ich hatte keine Pflicht, keine Ahnung und keine Frau
Mein Vater sagte: „Junge, mach! Bau dir was Kleines auf!“
Ich zog in 'ne fremde Stadt, und ich kam alleine aus
Und in den Folgejahren lernte ich, wie man kleine Stufen schafft
Ich lernte, wie man meisterliche Eierkuchen macht
Ich lernte, wie man lebt, ich lernte, wie man lebt?
Ich lernte, wie man gibt, ich lernte, wie man geht
Und ich lernte, dass alles irgendwie irgendwann zusamm'passt
Manchmal vergess' ich das, weil mir vieles Angst macht
Die Welt ist oft blind, taub, stumm und gepanzert
Doch ich bin es nicht, also komm in meine Mannschaft
Wenn du irgendetwas willst, dann versuch es nicht krampfhaft
Sag dem da im Spiegel: „Keine Sorge, du kannst das!“
Das Leben gibt dir mehr als du von ihm verlangt hast
Deshalb ist Kummer nicht immer gut, auch wenn er schlank macht, yeah

Ein Ton, eine Geste, ein Kuss und ein Wort verändert die Welt
Verändert die Welt
Erhelle die Dunkelheit mit Licht
Welch ein unbeschreblich' Glück dass wir noch hier sind
Dass wir noch hier sind
Ich wünsch' dir Liebe und Gesundheit und ein Haus das dich beschützt
Wünsch dir Tränen die dich zum Boden bringen
Und ein' Freund der dich stützt
Ein Ton, eine Geste, ein Kuss und ein Wort verändert die Welt (ein Wort verändert die Welt)

Wenn Fehler machen Lernen heißt, Junge, dann ?
Manchmal führen Fehler, die man macht, zu Begehungen
Und oft bin es ich selbst, der mich ?
Die schönen Dinge dieser Welt verdien' Erwähnungen
Und jetzt bin ich zurück und lass' nichts mehr abbrenn'
Wünsch mir wieder Glück, wenn der Schlips im Schrank hängt
Ich mach' hier mal 'n Strich, ich brauche kein Tipps
Mann, glaub mir ich bin froh wenn erstmal nichts mehr anfängt
Aber irgendwas ist immer, irgendwer klopft an deinem Zimmer
Grinst dich an, malt ein Bild, und wickelt um den Finger
Tanzt wie verrückt, flüstert Namen für Kinder
Mild wie der Mai und schön wie der spanische Winter
Glaub mir die Zeiten sind besser als wir sie sehen
Wenn wir mut hätten, wüssten wir öfter wofür wir stehen
Es ist Berlin, Lichtenberg, wunderschöner Tag
Ich kam, verstand und sprach

Ein Ton, eine Geste, ein Kuss und ein Wort verändert die Welt
Verändert die Welt
Erhelle die Dunkelheit mit Licht
Welch ein unbeschreblich' Glück dass wir noch hier sind

Geh ich fort, kommst du mir nach
Lauf ich weit, läufst du noch weiter
Und bin ich falsch bist du an meiner seite
Egal wo ich war baby
Warst du nie all zu fern von mir
Sprachen die leute gern von dir
Was du gibst, ich sterb dafür
Keine andere könnte mich verstehen
Ich weiß, ich verdank dir mein ganzes leben
All meine träume machst du wirklich wahr
Mehr als 3 sekunden bist du für mich da

Lauf nicht weit weg, komm nicht spät nachhaus
Geh mit keinem mit, dem du nicht vertraust
Denke an deine jacke, deine mütze und den Schirm
Aufziehende Stürme sind oft ziemlich schwer zu hören
Aber wenn du gehst, geh als Junge der du bist
Nehm es mit der Welt auf und geh erstmal zurück
Hol es nach Haus
Hol es nach Haus

Junge, hol die Lorbeeren nachhause
Vergesse niemanden, der immer an dich glaubte
Besuch mal wieder deine Oma, deine Tante, deine Eltern und erinner dich wer alles für dich baute
Hau mal wieder einen rein für Kaulsdorf
Pflanz ´n Baum, find ne Frau baut ein Haus dort
Gute Freunde kommen wieder wenn sie dich vermissen, alle andern kommen wieder wenn du aussorgst
Oder macht hast, oder ´n Sparbuch
Nehmt mir alles weg, Hauptsache ihr schlaft gut
Meine Freunde brauch ich nicht mal zu fragen
Kommen wenn es brennt und wollen nichts dafür haben
Und ich tu für euch das gleiche
Ich ?
Niemand hat gesagt dieses leben ist für die leichte
Doch ich trage euer bild immer bei mir auf der Reise

Ich erinner mich was mama sagte
Als ich wieder irgendwas verrücktes plante
Mit den Gedanken längst da draussen
Und niemals und niemals zurück

Lauf nicht weit weg, komm nicht spät nachhaus
Geh mit keinem mit, dem du nicht vertraust
Denke an deine jacke, deine mütze und den Schirm

Keine Angst vor garnichts (keine Angst)
Egal welches Spiel, du wagst es
Gute Karten kommen automatisch
Jeder findet diesen Jungen mal Symphatisch
Alles was du willst hast du hier
Die Frauen wünschen sich ein leben mit dir
Bleib nur auf der richtigen Spur
Wer sich alle Türen offenhält lebt auf dem Flur

Weil die Liebe nicht darin besteht still zu sein wie die Wüste
Noch darin, durch die Welt zu ziehen wie der Wind
Die Liebe ist die Kraft, die die Weltenseele verwandelt und veredelt
Als ich das erste mal in diese Weltenseele eindrang, da fand ich sie ganz locker

Lauf nicht weit weg, komm nicht spät nachhaus
Geh mit keinem mit, dem du nicht vertraust
Denke an deine jacke, deine mütze und den Schirm
Aufziehende Stürme sind oft schwer zu hören
Aber wenn du gehst, wenn du gehst
Aber wenn du gehst, wenn du gehst, wenn du gehst

I trade my old shoes for new feet
I grab a new seat
I don't like the one I got
The fabric's wearing through
And it's wearing me out
You're wearing me down

Watching old baseball games
And low budget telethons
Ain't like watching you yourself
When you yourself is on
Got time to wander to waste and to whine
But when it comes to you
It seems like I just can't find the time

So watch your head and then watch the ground
It's a silly time to learn to swim
When you start to drown
It's a silly time to learn to swim
On the way down

If I gave you my number
Would it still be the same
If I saved you from drowning
Promise me you'll never go away
Promise me you'll always stay

Closed down the last local zoo
I'm gonna win the endless war
Over who kills the last koala bear
And who in death will love him more then I

When you look at me oh so angry 
I know it's true 
My strength has come from loving you 
Behavior I just can't grow into

Fear is the color you've all exposed

Clever in what she does
Competing for the attention
Of those people that you know

Your absence until
I can't remember what I was or what I am
Who I know or what I know or where I go

Every day was that day
Every second was that second

The forecast is grey
But we're staying inside

You must live close 
I've seen you drive by
I left signs on the lawn 
Where have they gone?

Did you take them to tease me?
To follow or lead me?

A verse chorus and such

And letting go so I can be all alone
Feel myself, going slow
Feel myself, letting go

Not taken, not feeling like I'm yours

If you're taken I am yours
I'm up and doing circles
I'm taken, I am yours
I'm up and doing circles
I'm taken, I am yours
I'm up and doing circles
I'm taken, I am yours
I'm up and doing circles

I collapse
This life looks like a sentence, though
A constant game of falling short
If you know, you know
If you know, you know

When I feel like this
When I'm just so sick of feeling less than perfect
Is it right for me
I never fight to see if coming clean would get to me
I feel myself, holding back
I feel the pressure, it's finally back
I'm taken

When you feel like this
When you saw it call come crashing down
Subtle but not underground
I was there
I saw the signs, I saw unfair
And so I write to you through other means
I let myself finally feel taken
Like I was yours

If you're taken I am yours
I'm up and doing circles

I'm taken, I am yours
I'm up and doing circles

I collapse

It's not me, or how I would be

Pulling pieces of it out is such a waste of time
You keep on fighting to remember that nothing is lost in the end
Then you burn, burn, burn your life down

Get me to the door
Out of bed
On the track
I'm not sure
Starting over

It's a different situation, a different situation
You wake up in the night and refuse to be afraid of the now
Unfolding pieces of it faster, don't you waste your time
You've been planning to remember this so nothing will be lost in the end

Pa' los que se pican cada vez que zumbo
El que sirve, sirve
El que vale, vale
y el que no, no vale
Tú sabes, jaja
Tego Calde'

Las ganas tuyas de cantar más que yo
Con mi producción, loco, te humillo
A la puerta del estudio ponle pestillo
Prende la alarma en contra de los pillos
Es que, por ahí hay mucho loquillo
Que se enfurecen cuando yo brillo
Dicen que tienen más quioscos que en Luquillo
y no han vendio' ni un sinquillo 
Con medio posillo los acribillo
Ando siempre solo sin corillo 
soy sencillo, nunca me guillo
afueguillo ni le paso el rastrillo
A tu katana suéltale cabillo
y saca el deo del gatillo
Antes de que te fundan el bombillo
O que te guarden en El Castillo

A mí no me haces falta
Si tú quieres, juégate la carta
Compra una pistola, haste un pal' de marcas
Guillate de monstro o si fuera pero mera
la calle sabe que eres un pera
A mí no me haces falta
Si tú quieres, juégate la carta
Compra una pistola, haste un pal' de marcas
Guillate de monstro o si fuera pero mera
la calle sabe que eres un pera

No me copio, salí con un flow muy propio
Al envidioso le quito lo fantasmioso
En el Oso, Mendoza, asociao' somos poderosos 
Corte mafiosos, antecedentes dudosos
Sé lo que pasa sin mucha lata 
Si te zafas con mi raza te quemo las patas 
Ni tú, ni tu marido, ni tu pobre cochinchillo
Esto es sencillo pero en grande como Vadillo
Así que no te meta en camisa de once baras
O terminará en la cruz como Mara
O Penélope, problema evítate
No confunda la humildad del Abayarde
Lo que tú 'ta haciendo ahora yo lo hice en el nueve tre'
Pregunta por ahí, si tú no me crees
Madura, ni en esta vida ni en la futura me dura
Si nos vamos de verdura 
Hay que ser bruto o estar fumando basuco
¿A caso tú no oyes este trabuco?
Se creen que saben, pueden que los pelos caguen 
Callejón o musical, conmigo no sale

A mí no me haces falta
Si tú quieres, juégate la carta
Compra una pistola, haste un pal' de marcas
Guillate de monstro o si fuera pero mera
la calle sabe que eres un pera
A mí no me haces falta
Si tú quieres, juégate la carta
Compra una pistola, haste un pal' de marcas
Guillate de monstro o si fuera pero mera
la calle sabe que eres un pera

Donde estaban cuando mas falta me hacían
Ni tan solo una llamada
Ni siquiera me escribían
Se dan golpes de pecho por el parentesco
Pero mandan mas papas si mas merezco
Yo sabia que esto venia
Por eso insistía
Aunque sufría, mañana sera mi día me decían
Que bien se siente, sentir el cariño de mi gente
De mi isla y lugares adyacentes
Tengo una familia inmensa ahora
Esta conmigo a todas horas
Que me vigila
Y que me aconseja de cora'
Que habla de frente las verdades y las mentiras
Que si estoy pegao me apoyan
Y si no sirvo me quitan

Pal mundo entero este boricueo
Guapeo,fraseo, calchanchaneo
Les dije que mi libreta esta repleta
De letra' hasta las tetas
Mas especiales que topeka

Sigo gozando, haciendo el aguaje
No hay coraje,
Salir del clandestinaje
Yo combino lo que opino con lo que domino
Y lo decoro con mi flow latino

Yo se que no te gusto que viniera
Pero estoy aquí, soy la candela así que brega
Te molesta
Mi orgullito esta pimienta
Si yo soy el que te orienta con cositas como esta

Dando po' el cocote cada vez que pauta (que fue?)
Aguanta que llego grampa
El aballarde
Que dios te salve de calde
Si la dicha es buena nunca es tarde

Con chavos compras to' pero no este flow
Dont you know?
Si no tienes na lay low
Solo un kumi con carabali
Hache pa ti
Que naci con el don en mi

Hey!

Salte 'el medio
Que voy pasando
Demostrando como es el mambo
Ampliamente
Distinto y diferente
Como le gusta a mi gente

Oye!
Salte 'el medio
Que voy pasando
Demostrando como es el mambo
Traigo un swing como clemente potente
El caballote aunque este ausente

Aha

Qué bien te ves al caminar así
Sé que quieres bailar
De eso se diga más
Acércate a mí mujer que
Te quiero sentir
Junto a mi cuerpo siente la pasión
Profundo, como hacer el amor
Siente la música
Tu cuerpo pide más
Suéltate de una vez que quiero sentir tu piel

Como el cristal
Niña, tu cuerpo me hace suspirar
Tus ojos son
Como el cristal
Niña, tu cuerpo me hace (Me hace)

Vamo'a la barra, te invito a tomar
¿Quieres beber Moët o prefieres Cristal?
Siente la música
Tu cuerpo quiere más
Hasta el amanecer te quiero complacer
Veo el reloj, no lo puedo creer
Diez de la mañana, qué vamos hacer
Vmonos al hotel
Sé que quieres placer
No te resistas, solo quiero sentir amor

Tus ojos son
Como el cristal
Niña, tu cuerpo me hace suspirar
Tus ojos son
Como el cristal
Niña, tu cuerpo me hace suspirar

A mí me gustan las gatas que me dejan guardar mi corta en su bolsa
A las de que ni les importa, mami
Cuando te veo lo que siento es un cosquilleo
Como si estuviera en pleno canchechateo
¿Tú quieres bailar? No te me des guille
Si quieres gritar, grita hasta que te me galilles
Suéltate, mujer, que lo que quiero es sentir tu piel
Y es que tú te ves de lo mas aquel
Tus ojos son como el cristal
Tu cuerpo me hace suspirar
Y al bailar es como si estuviéramos al natural
Dándole a la masucamba, no cogas la joyilanga
Esto es Calde' y Maestro comiendo nalga
Otra cosa 
Pero bellacosa bien pegajosa
Cuando lo viste te quedastes sosa
Llegó el bravo de borinquén bella, el de la mella
No soy estrella, pero sigo dejando huellas (Jaja!)

En peligro de extinción (en extinción pues como nosotros)

Me refiero a eddie dee, El terrorista (de la lírica) 
Junto a Tego calderón (la nueva adquisición) 

Vuelve el abayarde el tego calde 
El que deba algo mas vale que salde 
Cree que eso tirando lírica que arde 
Porque si la DJ buena nunca e tarde 
Y vine pa cantar cantar con mozilla
Quemando como el tequila, causando extragos como gozilla 
Te estas metiendo con el tipo equivocao
Tengo algo pa ti por ley, porque no se a presentao

Tu anda bien guillao, con un estilo copion
Con carro alquilao y un prendao pretao 
Mucho DJ te an grabao? cuanto te as ganao
Pa pelao, quemao porque te an utilizao

Vivo underground, reciclando lo que e sonao
Entre lo mejore me e paseao, no me an opacao 
El tumbao, que no es copiao ni inventao
Es eredao del borin que me dio otro lao 
En extinciona porque hacemos las cosas decora
Mientras otros buscan fama,billete y corona

Por culpa de cantantes que an tirao basura 
Quieren sacarno de la radio prensa y televisore
Pero y lo mejore vamo a paga junto por pecadore? 

Se que el loquillo al aplaude al gatillo, de guerra y mucho corillo 
Prueba que no estoy de acuerdo con la tiraera
Ni la copiaera, primero apoyo a los mios y luego a los de afuera
Y soy del ghetto, vengo para obtener respeto
No hago como otro que quieren actuar como moyeto

Te guta como el balla sunba? quiero que sepa que soy queso 
Y moreno porque nací de la rumba
Así que en vez de ta guillandote de genio
Trata de invertarte algo para este milenio
No pierda tanto tiempo tanto tiempo tratando de hundirme

Con la disquera que le va tumbar la
Que me vo'a poner bien comemierda si mi disco pega 
Hacerle el remix a Christina Aguilera

Que difícil se me hace sin ti 
Yo tenía que escribir 
Por que a quien se lo iba decir 
A veces me quedo a recibir su llamada 
Pa decirle que Malcom nació y que Bony lo ama 

No ha sido fácil pero estoy bregando 
Con la misma piedra, cucando 
Usted sabe lo que estoy hablando 
Estamos extrañándolo, representándolo 
Bajándola por la goma, recordándolo 
Y esta conmigo trabajando bien 
Ahora viene el disco nuevo para ver quien es quien 
Hey! 

Lo cojo suave lo mío esta seguro

Sigo bregando con los puercos de esta industria 
Pero esta to' bien uno se las busca

Siempre evitando que el grande me aplaste 
Oye! 
Cogiendo las cosa día a día 
Si pierdo la razón, en el proceso sonría 

Hey! 
Por que bien se lo merecía la torta esta dividida 
Pa mis cría súper repartida 
Tengo Jiguiri record sigo cada día 
Hay mas de lo que soñé en mi alcancía 
Cante con la Fania 
Se que lo sabia, por que lo que no veía lo sentía 
En la Republica me censuraron por su canción preferida 
Esta to' bien, estamos al día

De mi cultura miso de averdura 
Una escuela que hasta el mas rico quisiera 
Calderón y la raza del nombre Esteban 
El que siempre me apoyo y en mi talento creyó 
Ni si quiera estando preso las espalda me dio 
Gracia por la madre que usted me eligió 
Pa darme la vida, Pila Rosario la mejor 
La socia mía, que más que yo sufría 
Y al final del pozo los veía 
No me quejo pues los tuve 32 años a mi lao 
De mi estando pegao 
Estuvo presente en el clemente 
Bellas Arte con Gilberto con mi hermanito Vicente 
Que difícil se me hace sin ti, lo tenía que escribir 
Eres mi héroe, ídolo del más existir

Si esa era tu misión lo lograste disfruta 
Tengo la batuta, no te ponga bruta 
Quisiera saber cual fue el doctor que te vio nacer 
Y maldecirlo a el por ti mujer 
Por que ni mi odio te has de merecer 
Eres la hija ilegitima de lucifer 
Yo quisiera desaparecer pa no volverte a ver 
Quedarme sin un peso y no tenerte que mantener

La paciencia se me acabo

Que sienta pena quien te pario 
Oh dios, oh dios 
La paciencia se me acabo

Si tu no aguantas te entiendo tienes razón 
Yo nunca te mentí conocías mi situación 
Te advertí que yo no era un bombón 
Si no me lo creíste aguanta el tropezón 
Por querer mis hijos me montan presión 
Departamento de la familia estoy claro en la manutención 
Pero se me impide con mi cría la relación 
Y mi frustración descargo en esta canción 

Oh dios, oh dios

Oh dios, oh dios

Yo nunca he violau la ley 54 
No me gusta el abuso, no apoyo el maltrato 
No to los padres son perros, ni to los perros son satos 
Ni soy un santo soy caco pero yo trato 
De llevar la fiesta en paz, no hay vuelta atrás 
Por mas bueno que uno sea pagan con maldad 
Con un rencor punzante y con un tumbau de gangster 
Confunden la mentecita de nuestra infante

La ley es ley, lo claro es lo claro 
Las madres no toas son buenas 
Ni to los padres son malos 
Señores sus errores, sus decisiones 
Las pagan los menores, analizen bien 
Cada caso es diferente, los niños lo agradecerán 
Ya verán, ya verán

Entiendes lo que te hablo, justicia basura 
Tu eres el que hace leyes por eso te curas 
No pudiste con Osama la cojiste con Saddam 
Chulería sin tan tan 
Muchos tuyos caídos, madres sin sus hijos 
Por eso el combo preferido mio es el de Cortijo 
Mi mayor virtud es mi mayor defecto, el talento 
De verdad ciento diez por ciento 
Por que el centavo es el que vale menos 
Por que en los barrios pobres se vende veneno 
Como llego aquí, quienes lo trajeron 
No sabemos, nosotros la hecha no tenemos 
Tanta gente flasa, poca cosa 
Se oye como invoca, la pedigueña es la que choca 
De cuando la fe se compra con billete mister

Como yo veo las cosas, yo las veo diferente a los demás 
Como yo veo las cosas, como yo veo las cosas

Voy a preguntarte esto como de abogado 
Que coge cualquier caso por chavos, bravo bravo 
Delincuente hasta depravado 
Como el de plaza, que tiro el baby pa' abajo 
Luego pasan a ser fiscal, el que te tira con to 
El que te quiere trancar 
Pa otro día, convertirse en su señoría 
Papeles que chocan y no se desvían 
Igualdad pa todos, di mejor pa' tos los de tu coro 
Que lavan los cuellos de sus camisas con clorox 
Yo te soy franco, no es que sepa tanto 
Al lao de ustedes yo soy un santo 
Yo veo las cosas ami manera
Sin partidos sin banderas 
La verdad es la verdad y es hija e Dios 
El tipo se creyo es el Mesias y to 
Mi naturaleza, mi crianza 
Traerla como es con elegancia 
Hablar lo que siento que debo 
Y seguir siendo simplemente Tego 
El apaga fuego, como cenicero 
Veo veo, son las gafas yo creo 
Sin subtitulos te leo, feo feo 
Yo soy mudo sordo y ciego 
El Subestimado, judiado odiado 
El mas imitado, mas comparado 
El Underdog hasta que muera 
Como pichirea, tegocaldero y sobra candela 

Como yo veo las cosas, como yo veo las cosas 
Como yo veo las cosas, yo las veo diferente a los demas 
Como yo veo las cosas, como yo veo las cosas 
Como yo veo las cosas, yo las veo diferente a los demas

Louis, Louis, the stage is aching for one
Please, come back to the quiet generation
We don't have any representation

Louis, Louis, our stars no longer dance
Louis, Louis, come down through the heavens
The sky is full of innuendos
We don't want any heroes

Louis, Louis, all we want is music
Louis, Louis, you play it without melancholy

Please, play a song for everyone
Play it like it was the only one
So it will travel through the valleys
Into the roses and the berries

Louis, Louis, they shot all the poets
Louis, Louis, the world is not like you know it
There's no one with the right agenda
That's why we stay down here and won't surrender

Teitur,"Feel like a thief about to break in
Standing outside a broken window
My breath is warm, the air is cold
Hear noises of insects in the green, wet grass

I'm not gonna sell what I have stolen
It's something that belongs to me

The floor simmers, I am nervous
Place my hand on the entrance wall
There are shrieking whispers in the closets
Layers of dust on every surface

Please wash my head in a bucket of water
Rinse every corner of my body

Feel like a thief about to break in
Watching people pass on the street
I wish to own the glow in their eye
Because they are so beautiful

I'm in my private desert
I'm in a passionate study

My skin shrinks against my body bones
I'm lost into the weight of gravity
I'm at my best with my astronomy

Pyramids and starlight
Orchestrated midnight
The math of infinity and reason
Waiting for mars to come out

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Téka,"Here we are
Alive and free
Far away in time from our darkest day
That took our young and brave

From the cradle to the grave
70 years ago on July one 1916 on the Somme
The enemies had never seen fighting like this before
Such a simple plan--

How could any German man
Survive through that ordeal?
Company 'A' to Company 'be	'
""Morale is high here, sir, but I don't think it's safe to go""

Company 'A' from Company 'be	'
""Mister you have your orders and you must obey""
So the first line rose, and the first line fell
And a poet who survived later wrote about

A ""Sunlit vision of Hell""
And ""Larks singing""
Because after all it's just another summer's day in France
And the Tommie's on the Somme sang

How the hell you been since I had no job 
Hum, why don't you give me some

Well I be, the bitch want to fuck Mike for free
Either slide me a G or get the fuck up out my ride see

Standin' strong through these struggles of this deadly game
Visions of body bags and my homies closed caskets
Illusions of prison and pistols pressures that I blastin'
I'm out to live with no time to play
I got the tendencies to kill in relentless ways
Straight up, cause life is a trick bitch, if you weep and reek
You stuck outta luck, seekin' for relief
Too much destruction, they claim we gotta make a change
So much trouble between each other cause ya ghetto life is strange

Philosophically, psychologically ya fixin' to be fucked
We goin' on this ride and ya bitch I'm gon' seduct

Ask the mound killer
Faces I remember they say dump him in the river

Me and Crime Boss and a nigga named Mister
Mike to a flight, had some glitz to deliver
Headed back to the Suave castle
I had to wrestle with this transvestite who had a dick like a lasso
In this castle was a midget with banana clippin'
Bootleg sniffin' or Mr. Mike'll fuckin' wicked

And my tech's out, makin' people scream
Seen niggas without two head count doin' push ups
I'm doin' sit ups, we stay like healthy
Cause niggas on my block are tryin' daily to out weigh me
Say we Jesus, help us God, time for harm
I'm gettin' number from the greasin' off in my palm
But I want some harder armor
Change my ways and ways I praise, amazing grace
How sweet the sound but now I'm catchin' evil
They think I'm sequel, ya see them people
Behind the bush, they want to cook us
Four more of them pussies on my pushin'
Against the breeze just like a kite
You got that right, no marchin' with me with cho' butter knife
This fight, don't need to make an effort, promise

Then go back to mothers
Have some sour cream smothered and buttered, no onion

Can't leave my cheese on the shelf
I know what's gonna be there, believe this
I can see or see this, families and orthopedics
Through the all valley seasons
Through earth, wind, and fires
But still pimps and liars got my family zoned and took us on higher
The scale is off the rim, somebody stole ya meal
How was I to tell, you was chokin high shit
A lot of time was wasted, on hoes in different places
I made the first step away like rehabilitation
I learned something so serious
Life is a game and when you play it's one time period
A lot of my niggas be playin' foul ball
Expect that tech when y'all ass get that last call

Been up for days cause where I stays, I can't blaze
A nap and it's beginning to weigh heavy on my thinkin' cap

I'm bout to pass out, slowly and surely off the wire
Relyin' on the starin' image of pimp shit
Nothin' but a word I see is pity
Now that the rain is gone I maintain killin' prone
Protection if you restin' in my zone
They in my spot, my home see
They want to take a load off my cot when you ain't makin' up ya own bed
Said Fred, that's the wrong leg snapper
You ain't gotta go home but I ain't cha' got damn Jed Clampett
But it's two misses that I miss in my direction
My own niggas in Memphis is cuttin' up my intersection
I did those and shattered lives and the lost souls
Save a prayer for them there table dancin' hoes

I guess I'm gonna seek through ya pines
I'm pressin' down the blinds to see reflection of super signs

A nigga just pulled off his plates and ran up the staircase
Plates till seen like a scene from a tale
And nigga thinkin' she a queen so he ain't physically well
I can tell from the cussin' he talkin' about bustin'
He grabs a galss and hits my ass with the bloody stubs and
Now you runnin' down the hallways tryin' to get to the stairways

I started last night but now it's sunny
Long run like Marie in Dunny(??)
Bitch on the side buggin, look honey
All I'm thinkin is, big money
Pussy don't come poke I don't fuck if I'm broke
That's how half these niggaz done, lost they stroke
Now, slide them lights and blow on my throw I
shakes 'em twice through the air they float, point
Twenty-five on the line (6 the easy way)
Thirteen in the field, 50 odds, oh my God
My whole table charged
I picks up a hundred eighty-eight yards
Sparks, balloons, room, V.I.P. cards
(Hook us up) You fuckers think y'all smart
Who sent y'all?  Hey fuck y'all
Fuck these cards, I'm outta Dodge

[Chorus]

[Tela]
Towards the do' my ass done stopped
You guessed it, I'm at them slots
I drops two rubber bands, why not?
I'm up a hand at the MG Grand
Two mo' honeybuns the whole shit locked
Big guns, seven across, jackpot
My ass is hot, I'm heated
I'm scorch, I'm holdin it down, I'm runnin the court
In other words to make a long story short
.. I know the fuckin sport
I got the owner bout to shit his shorts
I got the city on life support
After this run I'ma sit and soak
Cause after this run, ain't SHIT broke
After this run, I don't need to smoke
I'ma get a bitch and get throwed on the boat",Can't Stop Me
Tela,"It was this bitch that I knew back from '86
Graduated and made it from the college of dicks
Now who the fuck you be, bitch you know me
Tryin' to act solo, down low, hush-hush, and lo-key
Nah hoe I ain't po', where did my motherfuckas go
I remember this hoe, she used to do nails for Rochelle's, well
How the hell you been since I had no job
Hum, why don't you give me some
Cause you know I flow and run for Suave
Nah, all of that was on the couch
No doubt y'all records spin, y'all shippin' in gold
It's cold ""On The Outside Lookin' In"" (Br!)
You'd besta make yourself worthy
Cause I got a click of niggas ready to get their Johnson very dirty
You heard me push these thirty dicks, inside your pearly clit
Ain't this a bitch
I remember when you would not give me shit
Now you down for them habits
Put your numbers on them natural
Make it snappy cause I got to go to the bathroom

Hoes with no clothes sho 'nough
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what?
Hoes with no clothes sho 'nough
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what?
Hoes with no clothe sho 'nough
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what?
Hoes with no clothes sho 'nough
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what?, Suave love

No different from the rest
She's just an ordinary hoe
Hair extensions, long nails, ass thicker than gumbo
Make it fast, takin' cash, shakin' ass in the mix
Tens turn to twenties and twenties come from plenty tricks
Niggas in love
Can't stay out the club
All in the hoe's face
But at the end of the paper chase, whatever you had will be erased
I see him in the back
Countin' up that chedder
Talkin' loud, smokin' hay, makin' clouds, gettin' ready for the crowd
I think I know one
I remember you, oh yes I do
Tryin' to hide side from me and my crew, but ain't no love lost boo
What time the club close, at 3
What's up, you comin' with me
We can smoke up mad trees after you get up off your knees
You want some cheese
Hoes don't stay at the suave house
Hoes around my nuts like knats
Real dogs don't pay for cats, dats
For real baby
Recognize and sho me love, dig that shit, sho' 'nough

[Chorus]

Well I be God damned, this shy ass hoe
Wants to get close to me
A few years back in the past, you wouldn't of even noticed me
Quoting the, lyrics of the songs that you know I flow
Lookin for, confidants, and tickets to my next show
Check yo' bitch
In these short ass pants and blow up dresses
I can tell they freaky with out three guesses
Oh yes it's very true
Your bitches be needin' me, leavin' you
Hell, now what the fuck is a nigga like me supposed to do
Let her loose or let her remain
Cause all she be lookin' for is some fame
A bigger name
Look, this thang with bigger game
And she claim she ain't heard my music
Tryin' to trick me
So I told that hoe my name Bill Bigsly
She still hit me
Now she, killin' my dick softly with her mouth and I
Really just don't plan on takin it out cause I
M-J fuckin' G you needs to knows 'bout these hoes shakin'

Tela,"I woke up out that coma 2001
'bout the same time Dre dropped 2001
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude, Volume One
Rap critics politickin, wanna know the outcome
Ready to Die, Reasonable Doubt and Doggystyle in one
I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me
I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr. Dre was a (dream)
I had visions of makin a classic, then my world turned black
Like I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmaking and rapping
But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that
And it's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)

I had dreams of fuckin' a R&B bitch like Mya
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things
So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
'til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over, heard Jam Master say
""It's a hard knock life, then you pass away""
They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open
Cause a dream is kin to your last breath

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)

The dream of Huey Newton that's what I'm livin' through
The dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin you
Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Compton hat, jheri curl drippin on Ronald Reagan's shoes
Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue
It was all a dream like Big said it'd be
Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy
Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this? I'm livin' for my son
But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece like a catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend, has just begun

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)

Reach for the sky

Straight up we'll climb

I gotta shake you off
'Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy I gotta shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake you off

By the time you get this message
It's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me
Cause I'll be on my way
See I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say ""I told you so""
Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

I gotta, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
Off, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
(Gotta shake it off) off, shake, shake, shake, shake, 
Shake it off, shake, shake, shake, shake,shake it off

I found out about a gang
Of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one
By the pool, on the beach, in the streets
Heard y'all was
Hold up my phone's breakin' up
I'ma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time
so I'm leaving you behind
Cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't cha know

We relive abridge sails afloat
As to call light the soul shall sing
Of the velvet sailors course on
Of the velvet sailors course on
Shine or moons send me memories trail
Oer days of forgotten tales
Course the compass to offer
Into a time that we've all seen on
Into a time that we've all seen on

Sail away among your dreams

So the ends meet the river's son
Ours the story shall we carry on
And search the forest of the sun

And I do think very well that the son might take you silently
They move fast, they tell me
There's someone, rainbow

We danced as evening sang their song
We wander out the day so long
And I do feel very well that the evenings take you silently
They move round, sunlight

Whispers of clay, alternate ways
Softer messages bringing light
To a truth long forgotten on

Sands of companions sides that be

Chase all confusion away with us
Stand on hills of long forgotten yesterdays
Pass amongst your memories told returnig ways

We walk around the story
Out in the city running free
Days pass as seconds turn the key
The strength of the moment lies with you
Don the cap and close your eyes
Imagine all the glorious challenge
Iron metal cast to others
Distant drums
Force the bit betwenn the mouth of freedom
Didn't we learn to fly
Remember to sail the skies
Distant suns
Will we reach
Winds allow
Other skylines
Other skylines to hold you
Relayer, all the dying cried before you
Relayer, we've rejoiced in all their meaning
Relayer, we advance, we retrace our stories
Like a dreamer all our lives
Are only lost begotten changes
We relive in seagull's pages
Outward ways
Things are all in colours
And the size of others shall send you forward
Arranged to sail you toward
A peace of mind
Will we reach
Winds allow
Other skylines
Other skylines to hold you
Relayer, all the passion spent on one cross
Relayer, sail the futile wars they suffer
Relayer, we advance, we retrace our story

Pass amongst your memories told returning ways
As certain as we walk today

Out in the city runnig free

Out tender outward lights of you
Shine over mountains make the view
The strength of you seeing lies with you

I'm in New York, the sun is shining
And it's freezing cold

All I got is a phone number of a girl
Called Trishika, she told me to call her
If I was ever in town

I've been calling her for half an hour
But her phone is constantly engaged
I think I'll go for a walk

I stand outside a TV shop and stare
In the window, 'Attack of The Killer Tomatoes'
Is on the screens, Jesus

Stands next to me and says he's pleased
To meet me, a tomato jumps from

About the the things you said concerning my singing

Tell me are you for real or just faking?

I would work on my flow if you thought I had hip-hop in me

To impress the girls I'd work on my sensitivity
As for my debts, who's proud for punk crowd longevity

And if you told me that I could be famous
I present you with a list of changes I could make
We could fake the world out

Playing every show shirt lest ladies would adore us
Throwing pennies on stage at every single chorus
Then we'd break up the band 'cause all this money bores us

I smoke the chalice in Wonderland with Alice, 
Ain't trying to be the baddest, ain't trying to kick no habits, 
Giant white rabbits in tall hats got my back
Ain't nothing strange, life's like that.
I'm in a room full of one-eyed rhinos, albino ones singing
German songs like Hino, but what do I know, I don't know
Anything, I'm just here man waiting for you to let me in.

I'm feeling weak now, feeling like a freak now,
I creep everywhere I go
I keep my eyes closed when I'm crossing the road.

All neon like, kinda like Bowie singing changes

Sitting in the back with my speak and spell
You've got me, you're driving me insane, in the middle
Of the night screaming out your name
It was a game to you never a game to me
Now you're waiting to see what I'll do next, but like a reflex

They bring you what you need never what you hope for.
I guess by now they shoulda told ya

Like have you got the stuff I need a good day
There's so many things I just don't want to do

Did you get the letter, the one I never sent ya
I'm all alone on my own misadventure, seeking something
That I don't want to find, 'cause if I do there's no rewind.

Television,"Now Little Johnny Jewel,
Oh, he's so cool,
He has no decision,
He's just trying to tell a vision.

Some thought that this was sad,
And others thought it mad,
They just scratching the surface,
JJ can do the floor kiss.

Was he on display?
No, no, not today.
All that guy ever said,
He said, ""I want my little wing-head.""

He half-asleep at night
Over his head, sensation of flight.
And he wake up dreaming,
Dreaming...

And he run down to the airport,
The rush, the roar,
And he crouched down behind a fence,
With a chest full of lights,

Then,
He loses his senses...
Oh Little Johnny Jewel,
He's so cool,

But if you see him looking lost
You ain't gotta come on so boss!
And you know what he's paid,
You know that he's paid the price,

All you gotta do for that guy
Is wink your eye.",Little Johnny Jewel

I've been through time
Things flying by at the speed of light
I've been through the space
Where things like this occur in the night

I searched eternity for a love that seemed so true
Now somewhere between time and space
I'm waiting for you

Someday we're gonna live forever
Someday we're gonna be together
Someday with our Lord in Heaven, I pray, yeah

Someday, there will be Heaven

Ten,"Watching old home movies, the seeds so evident
Little did I know back then what my tapping fingers meant
A compulsive urge to hum a tune, to touch a piano key
In every sound and rhythm scape, I found a piece of me

The picture began to become more clear,
My purpose more firmly grounded
The day I sat at my brother's drums,
Picked up his sticks and pounded
I felt the ceiling open up, heart and mind were lifted
This primal force convincing me, my goals in life had shifted

Then I learned a few guitar chords just to seal the deal
The power of music I could not ignore, the surge inside
Me real
I plucked away at Misfits' tapes 'til I could play along
Then came the happiest day I've known- when I wrote my first song

A few interruptions since, I'm back where I belong-
Pen and paper, sticks and strings, the quest for the

Kids are murdered in the high school halls
Wake up kid and stop your whining
Every silver cloud has a black lining
The word hasn't changed
It just broke your bubble
Now you see you can't hide from trouble
You were raised in the suburbs
Mom and Dad gave you the best
The referee has left the field
And you're all alone to face this test
Do you have the strength
To maintain your precious values
Are you in control of your own fate
Or will you become one of those guys
You used to hate
Sooner or later everyone wants the best
And your private world becomes like all the rest
Nothing is worse it's just touching you

Can you see beyond today's euphoric state?
Do you remember how you'll feel tomorrow?

All the times you've had to wait
Every piece of food you ever ate
Reminds you of your fate

Reaching for the life that he never had
And he's just one step away
He's going backwards on a two track
He's going one step forward and two steps back
Getting closer to gray
In the end there's only grieving
All his goals inside pulled thin air
Can you blame him if he's desperate?
There's nothing left for him to get
And he dosen't care that the people stare
And they do fucking stare

This time it was all my fault
I'll be a good girl
And he won't have to get so mad
He does so much for me
I know he loves me deep inside
From now on I'll be so good
I will never hurt his pride
I guess I got what I deserved
And it does no good to cry
From now on I'll be good
This time I will really try

Thank you, I'm so happy now
How was your day?
I'd really like to see you soon
When will you be out this way?
I'm so glad that you were home
Gave me a chance to think it through
Let's not mention this again
The only one I ever told was you
Only you",Daddy

Ten Foot Pole,"It's funny how a little truth can put things in perspective
Usually, I try to hide from all of life's un-pleasantries
Like corruption, lies, and users
Try to ignore all the abusers
But sometimes truth just slaps me in the face

And I can't hide
Try to deny deception, but now I see the other side
I can't hide
Try to regain my innocence, but something's changed inside

Funny how perceptions change when you know secret history
Suddenly, you see right past the thin veil of diplomacy
Like the smiles that invite glare at you
Like they're filled with spite
The warm handshakes just seem so out of place
And I can't hide

Every person has a dark side; please, don't show me yours
I don't really think I want to know you can't be trusted
They say the truth will set you free
But they don't say how deep the cut will be
Trust dies and paranoia takes its place
And I can't hide",Denial
Ten Foot Pole,"It was the alcohol you said,
Took away your common sense,
You don't remember a thing,
Unconsiousness is your defense,
Its everybodys fault but your,
And now we must forgive,
How can you hold a grudge,
When you can't remember what you did?

but, its not so easy to forgive,
No matter what you said,
Its not so easy to forget,
It won't just go away,
It will never be the same,
You'll never drink that much again,
Those intentions sound just great,
And I'm glad to see you've learned,
I think its just a little too late



",Excuses
Ten Foot Pole,"Life's so unfair, you thought
Then turned on your TV
Life's so unfair you sobbed
Then picked up the keys

You lock your castle door behind you
To go for a ride
Your shiny car roars as you think
Of what you've been denied
No one understands your mind no one ever tried
No one has a clue of what you are inside

And I lie
But I believe myself
And the truth hurts more than anything else

Drowning in self pity killing time
It helps me to write the words
To think about the grime
And if you piss me off

Please don't apologize
My anger drives conviction as I proclaim these silly lies
If you don't believe me
Just read between the lines
No one has a clue of what's behind these eyes
And I lie",Fiction
Ten Foot Pole,"Hey Pete she said it's not too late
I still think that you're just great
You need to wait in the right place
Where you'll meet a girl with good taste

Aw, Ma don't you think I tried?
I think there's something wrong inside
I have no problem making friends
But that's where the story ends

I have no problem hanging out
Then I see a glimpse of doubt
And I don't understand
What makes them not like me?

I'm just trying to be myself
But it's so far from everyone else
And I don't understand what makes them not like me

Hey Pete I see from what you said
That the problem's all in your head
And if you want to make a change
You must let go of being strange

Yeah Mom the problem's in my brain
Sometimes I really think I'm insane
It goes much deeper than the beard
Deep down inside me I'm just weird

I have no problem hanging out
Maybe I'm just weird

You're not weird Pete you're just fine
And I'm proud to say you're mine
Regardless of the strange things you've done
I'm so glad that you're my son

You must let go of being strange",Hey Pete
Ten Foot Pole,"You took my closest friends
Split my family
I gave up everything I had
Except your memory but I know
Someone will hold your hand tonight
You won't remember me tonight

I wish I could forget so easily
Someone will hold your hand tonight
Someone will sleep right by your side
All I know is it's not me

I miss your piercing glare
I miss your fearless touch
All the little things
I never thought would mean so much

And after all this time
I thought we would forgive
I guess there is no turning back

You would always be here wait and see
Someone will hold your hand tonight
You won't remember me tonight

Ten Foot Pole,"John takes a seat so he can wind his watch
Not working anymore but it's so good to touch

It's the only solid evidence of what he's done and seen
It helps him to remember his past life was not a dream
It used to tell the time when he was young
But time means nothing now
He has a clear view of the sun

John stopped me on the street today
He didn't have that much to say
I said I had to get to work but he begged me to stay

There was a look in his eyes I'd never seen before
I couldn't walk away I knew I wouldn't see him anymore
He bummed a smoke looked off into space awhile
Then he looked into my eyes and unleashed a fleeting
Smile

Dennis it's so good to see you
You have no idea
Just how bad it's getting on the street
I try to hide away
But they find me every day
And I'm so tired of the heat

Yesterday I heard the news
They sent me a letter
Said it was suicide
But I know better",John
Ten Foot Pole,"Is there something more I just can't see?
I've been so busy trying every day to make ends meet
Been such a long time
Since I stopped to smell the coffee
Now I wonder: can I tell the forest from the trees?

I know that I feel pride and I know that I fear shame
I know I want you to smile when you hear my name
Seems like a silly game
But I know I play it harder than anything

I feel alone
There's people everywhere
Some of these people even care
Once in a while you find someone who really cares
But I'm too busy to give them what they need
It's not greed, it's the fear of failure
It keeps me going
But when tomorrow comes, there's always something more
And I can't stop working long enough
To wonder what life's for
What is it for?
Am I just a whore?
Who am I working for?",Pride and Shame
Ten Foot Pole,"You heard: it's no use trying to make sense, it doesn't matter anyway
There's no one worth the pain, no reason left to stay
I try to turn it off; where did the old me go?
How did I get so far away? I just don't know

Every act of kindness boils down to lust or greed
No one acts from altruism; it all comes down to need
There's a monster inside my heart
He tries to tear my world apart
There's a demon inside my head
Tells me I'd be better off dead

I try to turn it off, get back to positive
Don't want to drag you down to the street where I live
I try to turn it off, get back to happy days
Pull this barrel from my mouth and look for better ways
Every act...

Every time you might have lied
Every flaw you tried to hide
Every drop you ever cried
Every time you've been denied
Every tear that ever dried

Ten Foot Pole,"When she first apologized, it seemed that no one cared
No one cared about her shame
No one cared about her pain
And she could not accept that no one gave her time
She said, ""They will watch me
Yes, by God, I'll make them see.""

My God, I can't believe you're gone
It's too late to say ""hang on""
Sometimes you just have to wait
This time it's just too late

Every night she wrings her hands
Every night that's where she stands
And I cannot accept that I could have changed her fate
If I only would have known

My friends keep telling me that it will be all right

You said ""Noworries"" then I should have known,
Every time I've heard that phrase I've been let down,
Guess I have no one else to blame but me,
Even when I know it's wrong,
I still want to believe,

Another broken promise another time you failed us,
One more excuse to buy some time,
Another disappointment another dropped commitment,
You still won't admit you let us down,
Now you're angry that we won't hold on

You let me down",Another Half Apology
Ten Foot Pole,"I can't believe that it's been 2 whole years since I last saw you,
A wedding or a funeral,
I guess that's what it takes,
To pull me from my work,
To wake me from my sleep,
Remind me what's important,
Another year goes by and I don't look the same,
The new gray hairs the smile lines I'm weathered now I can't deny it,
One year goes by I'm old before my time,
but I won't change,
No I won't change inside,

Never thought I'd hurt someone,
Now I see you clutching your gun,
You're playing for keeps, 
There's no place left to run,
I had to make a choice I made it,
If I had another chance I'd take it,
I've got to find a way to make a getaway,
Today my future looked so bright,
All it took was one red light,
The sirens were close behind,
My brain said fight or flight,
So I ran from my mistake,
Not the best choice I could make,
The helicopter reminds me 
That this time there' s no lucky break,
I always did things my own way,
Never cared what the experts say,
I thought they were so full of shit,

Once again I ask myself,
Who am I what have I done that I am proud of?

Gotta stay strong don't let them say we're wrong,
Til we write our final words,

Ten Mile Tide,"I went sailin' out to the farthest seas
I went lookin' for answers and she came to me
I said, I don't know what to do
She said just stay with me, stay with me

I'd been up and down and all around
I'd been in every little corner of every little town
I said, I don't know where to go
She said just stay with me, stay with me

Well, the sun was going down and it was getting late
And the winding road ahead held a winding dose of fate
I said, I don't know just where to turn
She said just stay with me, stay with me

I looked at her, and she looked at me
And the signs were all there, it was so easy to see
She reached out and took me by the hand
And said just stay with me, stay with me

So I dropped my pack and I sparked up a light
And the fire grew high and her eyes glowed bright
I said, I don't know what to do
She said just stay with me, stay with me

(Chorus):

Why don't you
Stay the night with me

Well she opened her basket and there was plenty to share
As my lonesome guitar soothed the cool evening air
I said I've got some places I've gotta go
She said just stay with me, stay with me

I started strummin' a tune and it went something like this
It was soft it was smooth like a velvety mist
I said I don't think I am what you need
She said just stay with me, stay with me

Well, as the fog rolled in she drew closer to me,
Until the fire and her was all I could see
I said I can't allow myself to fall for you
She said just stay with me, stay with me

Then she reached out gently and put her hand on the strings
Said I'm not lookin' for love, I'm not lookin' for rings
I know you don't got those to give
I wish you'd stay with me, stay with me

So I dropped my guitar and I looked in her eyes
And the charm that was there made me gasp in surprise
And as she drew me in, I knew I was falling fast
And she said just stay with me, stay with me

(Chorus)

I woke up at dawn, but she wasn't around
And though I looked so hard, she was not to be found
I said my girl where have you gone
Why didn't you stay with me, stay with me

I searched and I scrambled and I searched some more
But the wind was arisin' my ship was too close to shore
I said my girl where have you gone
Why didn't you just stay with me, stay with me

Then I found her note, and it said she was gone
And I understood then why she set off alone
It said I walked away, but I wanted to stay
And have you stay with me, stay with me

Well, I'm sailin' now across unknown seas
But when I listen closely to the evenin' breeze
I swear I hear a whispered voice that says
Just stay with me, stay with me

So I'm headin' back, but I'm not there yet
Though it gets so hard when I see the sun set
And a voice inside my chest cries out
Just stay with me, stay with me

On a four lane highway heading down

So many memories, that can't be shared

How can I learn to trust myself

Goodbyes are the only thing I know.

But this path is understood only by my own.

Don't you sleep cause I can't sleep tonight.
The time is obvious to me.
Don't you sleep cause I can't sleep tonight.
So stay up late, wait up for me.

It's not the same here when you go.
You're disappearing like the daylight,
It's not the same here when you go.

Twice told and I won't say again,
When it's done I'm coming back to you,
(cause you're the reason why I still come home).
We got less then what we need,
So lets make the best of every desperate dial tone.

Don't you sleep cause I can't sleep tonight.

Don't you sleep cause I can't sleep tonight.
So stay up late, wait up for me.
Why can't you wait when every night is not the end?

Cause this road lacks human touch.

feels unconscious

Fall asleep I'm leaving

In the middle of the road.
And he said:
""Play the best song in the world, or I'll eat your soul."" (soul)

Well me and Kyle, we looked at each other,
And we each said. ""Okay.""

And we played the first thing that came to our heads,
Just so happened to be,
The Best Song in the World, it was The Best Song in the World.

Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
One and one make two, two and one make three,
It was destiny.
Once every hundred-thousand years or so,
When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow
And the grass doth grow

Needless to say, the beast was stunned.
Whip-crack went his whoopy tail,
And the beast was done.
He asked us: ""(snort) Be you angels?""
And we said, ""Nay. We are but men.""
Rock!
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh-ah-ah,
Ohhh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh!

This is just a tribute.

If we win, you must take your sorry ass back to hell.

Then you can take Kage back to hell...

Across the devils plain
We've walked with Jesus and his cross
He did not die in vain, NO!

We've run with wolves, we've climbed K2
Even stopped a moving train
We've travelled through space and time my friends
To rock this house again, ROCK!

We ride and we ride and we'll never subside
And we'll ride till the planets collide
And if you say that we do not ride
I'll tan you're fucking hide, RIDE!

Kyle's fingers be silver, Jacks voice then be gold
But lest you think we're vain
We know you're all robots and we don't care

And a cutlass supreme

",History
Tenacious D,"A long-ass fucking time ago, in a town called Kickapoo
There lived a humble family, religious through and through
But yea, there was a black sheep and he knew just what to do
His name was young J.B. and he refused to step in line
A vision he did see-eth, fucking rocking all the time
He wrote a tasty jam and all the planets did align

Oh, the dragon's balls were blazin' as I stepped into his cave
Then I sliced his fuckin' cockles with a long and shiny blade
'Twas I who fucked the dragon, fuckalizing fuckaloo
And if you try to fuck with me, then I shall fuck you too

Gotta get it on in the party zone
I got to shoot a load in the party zone
Gotta lick a toad in the party zone
Gotta suck a chode in the party zone, aah!

You've disobeyed my orders, son, why were you ever born?
Your brother's ten times better than you, Jesus loves him more
This music that you play for us comes from the depths of hell
Rock and roll's The Devil's work, he wants you to rebel
You'll become a mindless puppet, Beelzebub will pull the strings
Your heart will lose direction and chaos it will bring

You'd better shut your mouth, better watch your tone
You're grounded for a week with no telephone
Don't let me here you cry, don't let me hear you moan
You gotta praise The Lord when you're in my home

Dio, can you hear me? I am lost and so alone
I'm askin' for your guidance, won't you come down from your throne?
I need a tight compadre who will teach me how to rock
My father thinks you're evil but man, he can suck a cock
Rock is not The Devil's work, it's magical and rad
I'll never rock as long as I am stuck here with my dad

I hear you brave young Jaybles, you are hungry for the rock
But to learn the ancient method, sacred doors you must unlock
Escape your father's clutches and this oppressive neighborhood
On a journey you must go to find the land of Hollywood

In The City of Fallen Angels where the ocean meets the sand
You will form a strong alliance and the world's most awesome band
To find your fame and fortune, through the valley you must walk
You will face your inner demons, now go my son and rock

So he bailed from fuckin' Kickapoo with hunger in his heart
And he journeyed far and wide to find the secrets of his art
But in the end he knew that he would find his counterpart

Nothing could stop them when Jables and Rage hit the stage
and Hollywood Jack hit the big time and when to make movies
Rage Kage was left far behind in the dust of his dreams

And he grumbled and growled and watched Hollywood Jack on Jay Leno
He bellowed and said he'd be nothing without help from Kage
he burned up the photos of Jables and Kage doing mushrooms
""Fuck him, I don't need no Hollywood jack anyway""

So Hollywood Jack lived up high on a hill in a bubble
and Rage Kage live deep in the broiling valley below

Yes, the rage Kage bubbled with rage
He looked at the ground
and he looked on the stage
The lava was throwing
and boiling inside the old Kage

As Hollywood Jack climbed the ladder of stardom before him
He watched as his indie credentials flew right out the door
He'd make millions and then he'd go out and he'd make even more millions
He'd screened KG's calls and snorked coke of the ass of a whore

No one respected him
They just rejected him
No one would represent Kage
Left on the streets of his dreams
He'd would cry, and he'd rage for the stage

Ahahaaa

Then Hollywood Jack got a message that Kage was in trouble
They send Kage away cause he had gone completely insane
So Hollywood Jack jumped upon a jetplane and flew all that night through
the rain
To be with his friend to see what remained of his brain
Then Hollywood Jack told the doctors: You got to retrieve him!
You've got the technoligy, use the techniques of your trade
He grabbed the Lapelles and he screamed ""BY GOD YOU MUST SAVE HIM!""
Because Rage Kage and I can't you see that were one and the same!

That you're going completely insane

I just got home from the mill
She looked a little peaked, her eyes were kind-a streaked
I couldn't figure out what made her ill
She looked a little weepish, smiled kinda sheepish
The answer hit me like a hickory mall
I throwed my dinner bucket down
Yelled like my trailin' hound I was gonna be a daddy after all

Now the waitin'
Anticipatin'
Rock-a-bye
I'm gonna be a daddy now!

Well the weeks went by kinda sweetly, then all at once
I thought she'd lost her mind
She would rant, she would rave, for the things she would crave
Like ice cream and sauerkraut combined
She wanted watermelon, it was wintertime
Dill pickles set around the house in jars
My how she'd eat that stuff, she never seemed to get enough
And at 3am she'd want candy bars
Oh,

Now the waitin'
Anticipatin'
Rock-a-bye
I'm gonna be a daddy now!

Well at last the time was drawin' near, I began to walk and pace and sweat
The doctor said: Now son, I know this ain't no fun
But we ain't never lost a Daddy yet
I stood up and set down, I even though of leavin' town
The doctor and nurse came out all grins

Tequila Sunrise,"When the moon is bright
On a Saturday night
There's a thousand stars in the sky
On a winding road her memory flows
She'll face the fact
She wants to go back

She opens her heart to an old memory
She closes her eyes and she smiles
Just ask her if she ever still
Thinks about me
She'll say ""Every once in a while,
Every once in a while""

She tries to forget
But she hasn't yet
Not a single day goes by
That feeling again reminds of when
I held her tight, it felt so right

She opens her heart to an old memory
She closes her eyes and she smiles
Just ask her if she ever still
Thinks about me
She'll say ""Every once in a while,
Every once in a while""

And every once in a while
She calls my name out loud
And when she thinks about us
She'll face the fact
She wants to go back

She opens her heart to an old memory
She closes her eyes and she smiles
Just ask her if she ever still
Thinks about me
She'll say ""Every once in a while,
Every once in a while""",Every Once in a While [*]
