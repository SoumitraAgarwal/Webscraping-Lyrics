Left Hand Solution,"At the side of the world 
I watch your painless face
It's a veil that covers all 
The falsehood that you carry 
It is true, 
It is true 
That I've never been here before
Now, that's a lie, 
That's a lie 
That has been used before 
All the shining light
they've hidden away inside
All the dying light
the light shines black inside 
At side of the world 
I watch the painless ones
I am an insect 
Waiting to be devoured
It is true, 
It is true 
That I never wrote 
These words before
Now, that's a lie 
That we reuse 
Everytime we are alone 
All the shining light
They've hidden away inside
All the dying light
The light shines black inside",Light Shines Black
Left Hand Solution,"As I drift away through the bluish light
Your velvet touch it fondles me as I step inside 
My universal sleep, once again it's calling me 
I wait for the proper moment to venture into the dream 
Drink from this fountain, built from a heart of stone
The waters pouring through it are the dreams 
I walk along Drink from this fountain, built from a heart of stone 
Lucid dream desire
Here I'm just a fragment of things that used to be 
What is true might not be real when you step into my dream 
I'm one without name among stars in your sky 
I am just a fragment of things that never came to life 
I dream forever more And my dreams shall forever be 
Drink from this fountain, built from a heart of stone 
The waters pouring through it are the dreams I walk along 
Drink from this fountain, built from a heart of stone 
Lucid dream desire",Lucid Dream Desire
Left Hand Solution,"Well, I was born an original sinner
I was born from original sin
And if I had a dollar bill for all the things I've done
There'd be a mountain of money piled up to my chin

My mother told me good, my mother told me strong
She said, ""Be true to yourself and you can't go wrong
But there's just one thing that you must understand
You can fool with your brother but don't mess with a missionary man""

Don't mess with a missionary man
Don't mess with a missionary man

Well, the missionary man, he's got God in his side
He's got the saints and apostles backin' up from behind
Black eyed looks from those Bible books
He's a man with a mission, got a serious mind

There was a woman in the jungle and a monkey on a tree
The missionary man he was followin' me
He said, ""Stop, what you're doing, get down upon your knees
I've a message for you that you better believe""

Don't mess with a missionary man
Don't mess with a missionary man

Well, I was born an original sinner
I was born from original sin
And if I had a dollar bill for all the things I've done
There'd be a mountain of money

You can fool with your brother
Don't mess with the missionary man
Missionary man
Following me

Left Hand Solution,"This can't make me better, 
But at least I'm gonna try 
Makes the bitterness come so much more alive 
One-way ticket to a zone 
To take me away from this night 
The insect crawled out and died 
In the light of a sun too bright 
Your worn out face - The liquid anguish is brought 
Your worn out face - I've seen them all before 
Fading slowly, whispering souls
Wallowing deeper, swallowing souls 
This can't make me better, 
But at least I'm gonna try 
Makes the Orient night come so much more alive 
Your worn out face - The liquid anguish is brought 
Your worn out face - I've seen them all before 
Sing to me your lullaby so sweet 
Sing to me corrosive sleep 
Fading slowly, whispering souls 
Wallowing deeper, swallowing souls",Orient Nights
Left Hand Solution,"I stare upon the endless walls, your walls of steel
My eyes are tired, your name weights heavy in me
I hear my innervoice, it's calling for compassion
It's in the traces of a long forgotten generation

It's a temporary grace you wear
The persistence of my memories

I hear my innervoice, a voice filled with regret
The veil of virtue hangs deep around your neck

It's a temporary grace you wear
The persistence of my memories

I'm staring down
Your angels cry, they never fly
I'm staring down
And with the cry your angels die

It's a temporary grace you wear
The persistence of my memories",Persistence of Memory
Left Hand Solution,"I watched those raindrop tears 
As they ran down your face 
Your flowers be evil 
Your vanity, black in grace 
On raven wings, open up the night 
Lighten up the moon 
On raven wings, open up the clouds 
And heaven cries with you until the end of time
 
Mirrored in the moonlight 
Of the cold winternight 
A marble smile on your lips 
And that wicked gaze in your eyes 
On raven wings, open up the night 
Lighten up the moon 
On raven wings, open up the clouds 
And heaven cries with you until the end of time",Raven Wings
Left Hand Solution,"This night be our last, 
Still we're bound together 
This night be our last, 
Like a knife cutting it through 
And it's flowing from you, 
Gently weeps away 
I take in little sips 
On this day of rain 
On a road to nowhere, 
Fragile as one can be 
Trying to get to somewhere far away 
A crimson shadow, 
One last stain I had to clean 
The crimson shadow dissolves the dream 
And it's flowing from you, 
Gently weeps away 
I take in little sips 
On this day of rain 
As it cracks 
And leaves me bleeding 
On a road to nowhere, 
Fragile as one can be 
Trying to get to somewhere far away",A Road to Nowhere
Left Hand Solution,"Take this last wish that was never granted 
I held it inside my heart 
It hurts more than it ever did before 
'Cause things aren't always what they seem to be 
They never are... 

New flesh for a soiled soul 
Crawl with me in the dust 
Dirty just for you, crawling just for you 
Crawl with me in the dust 
Dirty just for you, crawling for the 
Soiled souls 

I wish for this treasure to be discovered 
The world becomes a shelter in the hole 
It burns more than it ever did before 
Things aren't always what they seem to be 
The never are... 

New flesh for a soiled soul",Soiled Souls
Left Hand Solution,"Let me take you away, 
Let me show you the way 
To where you've never been, 
To a world between 
Dance the light away 
In this passionate play 
Through the forests 
So green of the green theory 
Places I've seen, places I've been to 
Places I've seen in my dreams 
Our travel through times, 
The things that remind 
How our past will be, 
What our future has seen 
Places I've seen, places I've been to 
Places I've seen in my dreams 
We fall with the rain",Vision
Leftfield,"How many bridges can they burn, till we turn?
How many lives can they take, till we break?
How many dreams tells lies, till we rise?
How many visions will they burn, till we learn?

How many homes set alight, till we fight?
How many futures must we dream, till we scream?
How many sins must they repeat, till we're beat?
How many?
How many times?",21st Century Poem
Leftfield,"Taken by surprise by the size of my brain
Knowing all the time all the lies all the games
Thinking up a storm when it storms it's going to rain
Taking what's mine all the time, all the time
Take some for yourself
It's all good for something
And when there's no more to give
The window will shine in the light
On what's left for me
Knowin' your mind, knowin' your mind
That you've got to remember
You've got to remember, your name
Knowin' your mind, knowin' your mind
That you've got to remember
That you've got to remember, your name
Staggering around, can't find a place to sit down
Nothing suits my ass
Toast to some champagne of pain
I know you can bring us all a bottle
Remember the time when time was a friend
And you could make him lend you a hand
Now there's a place where taking takes place
And time just gets in your way
Take some for yourself
It's all good for something
And when there's no more to give
The window will shine in the light
On what's left for me
Knowin' your mind, knowin' your mind
That you've got to remember
That you've got to remember, your name
Knowin' your mind, knowin' your mind
That you've got to remember
You've got to remember, your name
Knowin' your mind, knowin' your mind
That you've got to remember
You've got to remember, your name
Knowin' your mind, knowin' your mind
That you've got to remember
You've got to remember, your name
Yeah, take some for yourself
It's all good for something

Leftfield,"Sonically we're in control
We're the diamond in your soul
Images come thick and fast
From the future, from the past

The film starts, the film ends,
Nothing is said in between.
Just sudden moments from someone else's story,
Will it ever be the same again?
Hours filled with conversation, no attention paid.
Too distracting convention, no need for friends.
Will it ever be the same again?
Will it ever be the same again?

You're original, with your own path
You're original, got your own way (x2)

Will it ever be the same again? (x2)
I need to hear that again
Because a dream starts, and a dream must end.

My mother told me, don't ever change

Yellow hair a-flying through the breeze

Never have I seen such a vision
In my wildest memory
When I wake up in the morning
Your face is all that I see

Oh, won'tcha take me down
To the bend in the river
Hold me close under the willow trees

And tell me, darling
That you'll love me forever
And together we'll set our spirits free

River flowing blue and lazy
Carry my troubles right downstream
Sun hanging low and hazy
Right in the middle of a summertime dream

Now that you're right beside me
Never am I gonna let you go
Feeling so free and easy
Just watching that river flow

Oh, yeah, won'tcha take me down
To the bend in the river

Well, I woke up this mornin'
She really hadn't done me wrong
I know it's not fair
But my good gal has done caught air

I'm goin' away, leavin' today
I'm gonna bring my baby back
If that eight wheel driver
Don't jump the railroad track
I take her from that man
Gonna bring her home if I can

My gal's been triflin' 'round
About a week I know
Several of my friends
Just told me so and so
She's found a new man
And now I can understand

So I'm goin' away, leavin' today
I'm gonna bring my baby back
If that eight wheel driver
Don't jump the railroad track
I take her from that man
Gonna bring her home if I can

Well, it's true, my baby's gone
I know it won't be long
We'll both be on that train
My baby's comin' home again
She's been triflin' 'round
But now she has turned him down

Yeah, I'm goin' away, leavin' today
I'm gonna bring my baby back
If that eight wheel driver
Don't jump the railroad track

Gonna bring her home if I can",Travelin' Blues
Lefty Frizzell,"Last night all alone in a Bar Room
Met a girl with a drink in her hand
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair, and eyes that would tempt any man

Then she came and sat down at my table, and as she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine

And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded to push my conscience a--side

Then we danced and she whispered I need you 
Take me a--way from here and be 
My man
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it

“Well, I’ve been around this big wide world
Sat home on a hill but honey that’s mine
I’ve got the money and God loves the time”

I can still get around like I did before

Have someone along to help spend my mon

Calvary.
I found grace, grace with the awesome power to set the

I found grace, sustaining grace
I found grace, redeeming grace
Yes I found grace, fulfiling, indwelling grace, his 
Loving grace
Yes I found grace, amazing grace to meet my need.

I sought for wisdom in the ways of this world
But no wisdom could be found.
I sought for meaning in the words of great men
But their words just let me down.
Not seeking justice for the things that I'd done
My soul needed mercy and I found it in god's son.

Legião Urbana,"Ainda me lembro aos três anos de idade
O meu primeiro contato com as grades
O meu primeiro dia na escola
Como eu senti vontade de ir embora
Fazia tudo que eles quisessem
Acreditava em tudo que eles me dissessem
Me pediram para ter paciência
Falhei

Gritaram cresça e apareça!
Cresci e apareci e não vi nada
Aprendi o que era certo com a pessoa errada
Assistia o jornal da TV
E aprendi a roubar pra vencer
Nada era como eu imaginava
Nem as pessoas quem eu tanto amava
Mas e daí, se é mesmo assim
Vou ver se tiro o melhor pra mim

Me ajuda se eu quiser
Me faz o que eu pedir
Não faz o que eu fizer
Mas não me deixe aqui
Ninguém me perguntou se eu 'tava pronto
E eu fiquei completamente tonto
Procurando descobrir a verdade
No meio das mentiras da cidade
Tentava ver o que existia de errado

Quantas crianças Deus já tinha matado
Beberam meu sangue e não me deixam viver
Tem o meu destino pronto e não me deixam escolher
Vem falar de liberdade pra depois me prender
Pedem identidade pra depois me bater
Tiram todas minhas armas
Como posso me defender?
Vocês venceram esta batalha
Quanto a guerra vamos ver",O Reggae

Eduardo abriu os olhos, mas não quis se levantar
Ficou deitado e viu que horas eram
Enquanto Mônica tomava um conhaque
No outro canto da cidade, como eles disseram

Eduardo e Mônica um dia se encontraram sem querer
E conversaram muito mesmo pra tentar se conhecer
Um carinha do cursinho do Eduardo que disse
""Tem uma festa legal, e a gente quer se divertir""

Festa estranha, com gente esquisita
""Eu não 'to legal, não aguento mais birita""
E a Mônica riu, e quis saber um pouco mais
Sobre o boyzinho que tentava impressionar
E o Eduardo, meio tonto, só pensava em ir pra casa
""É quase duas, eu vou me ferrar""

Eduardo e Mônica trocaram telefone
Depois telefonaram e decidiram se encontrar
O Eduardo sugeriu uma lanchonete
Mas a Mônica queria ver o filme do Godard

Se encontraram então no parque da cidade
A Mônica de moto e o Eduardo de camelo
O Eduardo achou estranho, e melhor não comentar
Mas a menina tinha tinta no cabelo

Eduardo e Mônica era nada parecidos
Ela era de Leão e ele tinha dezesseis
Ela fazia Medicina e falava alemão
E ele ainda nas aulinhas de inglês

Ela gostava do Bandeira e do Bauhaus
De Van Gogh e dos Mutantes, de Caetano e de Rimbaud
E o Eduardo gostava de novela
E jogava futebol de botão com seu avô

Ela falava coisas sobre o Planalto Central
Também magia e meditação
E o Eduardo ainda tava no esquema ""escola, cinema
Clube, televisão""

E mesmo com tudo diferente, veio mesmo, de repente
Uma vontade de se ver
E os dois se encontravam todo dia
E a vontade crescia, como tinha de ser

Eduardo e Mônica fizeram natação, fotografia
Teatro, artesanato, e foram viajar
A Mônica explicava pro Eduardo
Coisas sobre o céu, a terra, a água e o ar

Ele aprendeu a beber, deixou o cabelo crescer
E decidiu trabalhar
E ela se formou no mesmo mês
Que ele passou no vestibular

E os dois comemoraram juntos
E também brigaram juntos, muitas vezes depois
E todo mundo diz que ele completa ela
E vice-versa, que nem feijão com arroz

Construíram uma casa há uns dois anos atrás
Mais ou menos quando os gêmeos vieram
Batalharam grana, seguraram legal
A barra mais pesada que tiveram

Eduardo e Mônica voltaram pra Brasília
E a nossa amizade dá saudade no verão
Só que nessas férias, não vão viajar
Porque o filhinho do Eduardo 'tá de recuperação

Era o que todos diziam quando ele se perdeu
Deixou pra trás todo o marasmo da fazenda
Só pra sentir no seu sangue o ódio que Jesus lhe deu

Quando criança só pensava em ser bandido
Ainda mais quando com um tiro de soldado o pai morreu
Era o terror da sertania onde morava
E na escola até o professor com ele aprendeu

Ia pra igreja só pra roubar o dinheiro
Que as velhinhas colocavam na caixinha do altar
Sentia mesmo que era mesmo diferente
Sentia que aquilo ali não era o seu lugar

E as coisas que ele via na televisão
Juntou dinheiro para poder viajar
De escolha própria, escolheu a solidão

Comia todas as menininhas da cidade
De tanto brincar de médico, aos doze era professor
Aos quinze, foi mandado pro o reformatório
Onde aumentou seu ódio diante de tanto terror

Não entendia como a vida funcionava

Ficou cansado de tentar achar resposta
E comprou uma passagem, foi direto a Salvador

E lá chegando foi tomar um cafezinho
E encontrou um boiadeiro com quem foi falar
E o boiadeiro tinha uma passagem e ia perder a viagem
Mas João foi lhe salvar

Dizia ele: ""Estou indo pra Brasília
Neste país lugar melhor não há
Tô precisando visitar a minha filha
Eu fico aqui e você vai no meu lugar""

E conhecia muita gente interessante
Até um neto bastardo do seu bisavô

Um peruano que vivia na Bolívia
E muitas coisas trazia de lá
Seu nome era Pablo e ele dizia
Que um negócio ele ia começar

E o Santo Cristo até a morte trabalhava
Mas o dinheiro não dava pra ele se alimentar
E ouvia às sete horas o noticiário
Que sempre dizia que o seu ministro ia ajudar

Mas ele não queria mais conversa
E decidiu que, como Pablo, ele ia se virar
Elaborou mais uma vez seu plano santo
E sem ser crucificado, a plantação foi começar

""Tem bagulho bom ai!""
E João de Santo Cristo ficou rico
E acabou com todos os traficantes dali

Fez amigos, frequentava a Asa Norte
E ia pra festa de rock, pra se libertar
Mas de repente
Sob uma má influência dos boyzinho da cidade
Começou a roubar

Já no primeiro roubo ele dançou
E pro inferno ele foi pela primeira vez
Violência e estupro do seu corpo
""Vocês vão ver, eu vou pegar vocês""

Agora o Santo Cristo era bandido
Destemido e temido no Distrito Federal
Não tinha nenhum medo de polícia
Capitão ou traficante, playboy ou general

Foi quando conheceu uma menina
E de todos os seus pecados ele se arrependeu
Maria Lúcia era uma menina linda
E o coração dele pra ela o Santo Cristo prometeu

Ele dizia que queria se casar
E carpinteiro ele voltou a ser
""Maria Lúcia pra sempre vou te amar
E um filho com você eu quero ter""

O tempo passa e um dia vem na porta
Um senhor de alta classe com dinheiro na mão
E ele faz uma proposta indecorosa
E diz que espera uma resposta, uma resposta do João

""Não boto bomba em banca de jornal
Nem em colégio de criança isso eu não faço não
E não protejo general de dez estrelas
Que fica atrás da mesa com o cu na mão

E é melhor senhor sair da minha casa
Nunca brinque com um Peixes de ascendente Escorpião""
Mas antes de sair, com ódio no olhar, o velho disse
""Você perdeu sua vida, meu irmão""

""Você perdeu a sua vida meu irmão
Você perdeu a sua vida meu irmão
Essas palavras vão entrar no coração
Eu vou sofrer as consequências como um cão""

Não é que o Santo Cristo estava certo
Seu futuro era incerto e ele não foi trabalhar
Se embebedou e no meio da bebedeira
Descobriu que tinha outro trabalhando em seu lugar

Falou com Pablo que queria um parceiro
E também tinha dinheiro e queria se armar
Pablo trazia o contrabando da Bolívia
E Santo Cristo revendia em Planaltina

Mas acontece que um tal de Jeremias,
Traficante de renome, apareceu por lá
Ficou sabendo dos planos de Santo Cristo
E decidiu que, com João ele ia acabar

Mas Pablo trouxe uma Winchester-22
E Santo Cristo já sabia atirar
E decidiu usar a arma só depois
Que Jeremias começasse a brigar

Jeremias, maconheiro sem-vergonha
Organizou a Rockonha e fez todo mundo dançar
Desvirginava mocinhas inocentes
Se dizia que era crente mas não sabia rezar

E Santo Cristo há muito não ia pra casa
E a saudade começou a apertar
""Eu vou me embora, eu vou ver Maria Lúcia
Já tá em tempo de a gente se casar""

Chegando em casa então ele chorou
E pro inferno ele foi pela segunda vez
Com Maria Lúcia Jeremias se casou
E um filho nela ele fez

Santo Cristo era só ódio por dentro
E então o Jeremias pra um duelo ele chamou
Amanhã às duas horas na Ceilândia
Em frente ao lote 14, é pra lá que eu vou

E você pode escolher as suas armas
Que eu acabo mesmo com você, seu porco traidor
E mato também Maria Lúcia
Aquela menina bosal pra quem jurei o meu amor

E o Santo Cristo não sabia o que fazer
Quando viu o repórter da televisão
Que deu notícia do duelo na TV
Dizendo a hora e o local e a razão

No sábado então, às duas horas,
Todo o povo sem demora foi lá só para assistir
Um homem que atirava pelas costas
E acertou o Santo Cristo, começou a sorrir

Sentindo o sangue na garganta,
João olhou pras bandeirinhas e pro povo a aplaudir
E olhou pro sorveteiro e pras câmeras e
A gente da TV que filmava tudo ali

E se lembrou de quando era uma criança
E de tudo o que vivera até ali
E decidiu entrar de vez naquela dança
""Se a via-crucis virou circo, estou aqui""

E nisso o sol cegou seus olhos
E então Maria Lúcia ele reconheceu
Ela trazia a Winchester-22
A arma que seu primo Pablo lhe deu

""Jeremias, eu sou homem. coisa que você não é
E não atiro pelas costas não
Olha pra cá filha da puta, sem-vergonha
Dá uma olhada no meu sangue e vem sentir o teu perdão""

E Santo Cristo com a Winchester-22
Deu cinco tiros no bandido traidor
Maria Lúcia se arrependeu depois
E morreu junto com João, seu protetor

E o povo declarava que João de Santo Cristo
Era santo porque sabia morrer
E a alta burguesia da cidade
Não acreditou na história que eles viram na TV

E João não conseguiu o que queria
Quando veio pra Brasília, com o diabo ter
Ele queria era falar pro presidente
Pra ajudar toda essa gente que só faz

Tua tristeza é tão exata
E hoje o dia é tão bonito

A não termos mais nem isso

Os sonhos vêm e os sonhos vão
E o resto é imperfeito

Dissestes que se tua voz
Tivesse força igual
À imensa dor que sentes
Teu grito acordaria
Não só a tua casa

Nem os santos têm ao certo
A medida da maldade
E há tempos são os jovens

E há ferrugem nos sorrisos
Só o acaso estende os braços
A quem procura

Seguir nossos instintos primitivos

Nossos últimos momentos divertidos?

De uma revolução de merda
De generais e de um exército de merda
Não nunca poderemos esquecer

Nem devemos perdoar

Abra os olhos e o coração
Estejamos alertas

Legião Urbana,"João Roberto era o maioral
O nosso Johnny era um cara legal

Ele tinha um Opala metálico azul
Era o rei dos pegas na Asa Sul
E em todo lugar

Quando ele pegava no violão
Conquistava as meninas
E quem mais quisesse ter
Sabia tudo da Janis
Do Led Zeppelin, dos Beatles e dos Rolling Stones

Mas de uns tempos pra cá
Meio que sem querer
Alguma coisa aconteceu

Johnny andava meio quieto demais
Só que quase ninguém percebeu

Johnny estava com um sorriso estranho
Quando marcou um super pega no fim de semana
Não vai ser no CASEB
Nem no Lago Norte, nem na UNB

As máquinas prontas
E um ronco de motor
A cidade inteira se movimentou

E Johnny disse
""Eu vou pra curva do Diabo em Sobradinho e vocês?""

E os motores saíram ligados a mil
Pra estrada da morte o maior pega que existiu
Só deu pra ouvir, foi aquela explosão
E os pedaços do Opala azul de Johnny pelo chão

No dia seguinte, falou o diretor
""O aluno João Roberto não está mais entre nós
Ele só tinha dezesseis
Que isso sirva de aviso pra vocês""

E na saída da aula, foi estranho e bonito
Todo mundo cantando baixinho

""Strawberry fields forever""
""Strawberry fields forever""

E até hoje, quem se lembra
Diz que não foi o caminhão
Nem a curva fatal
E nem a explosão

Johnny era fera demais
Pra vacilar assim
E o que dizem que foi tudo
Por causa de um coração partido

Legião Urbana,"Não tinha medo o tal João de Santo Cristo
Era o que todos diziam quando ele se perdeu
Deixou pra trás todo o marasmo da fazenda
Só pra sentir no seu sangue o ódio que Jesus lhe deu

Quando criança só pensava em ser bandido
Ainda mais quando com um tiro de soldado o pai morreu
Era o terror da sertania onde morava
E na escola até o professor com ele aprendeu

Ia pra igreja só pra roubar o dinheiro
Que as velhinhas colocavam na caixinha do altar
Sentia mesmo que era mesmo diferente
Sentia que aquilo ali não era o seu lugar

Ele queria sair para ver o mar
E as coisas que ele via na televisão
Juntou dinheiro para poder viajar
De escolha própria, escolheu a solidão

Comia todas as menininhas da cidade
De tanto brincar de médico, aos doze era professor
Aos quinze, foi mandado pro o reformatório
Onde aumentou seu ódio diante de tanto terror

Não entendia como a vida funcionava
Discriminação por causa da sua classe e sua cor
Ficou cansado de tentar achar resposta
E comprou uma passagem, foi direto a Salvador

E lá chegando foi tomar um cafezinho
E encontrou um boiadeiro com quem foi falar
E o boiadeiro tinha uma passagem e ia perder a viagem
Mas João foi lhe salvar

Dizia ele: ""Estou indo pra Brasília
Neste país lugar melhor não há
Tô precisando visitar a minha filha
Eu fico aqui e você vai no meu lugar""

E João aceitou sua proposta
E num ônibus entrou no Planalto Central
Ele ficou bestificado com a cidade
Saindo da rodoviária, viu as luzes de Natal

Meu Deus, mas que cidade linda,
No Ano Novo eu começo a trabalhar
Cortar madeira, aprendiz de carpinteiro
Ganhava cem mil por mês em Taguatinga

Na sexta-feira ia pra zona da cidade
Gastar todo o seu dinheiro de rapaz trabalhador
E conhecia muita gente interessante
Até um neto bastardo do seu bisavô

Um peruano que vivia na Bolívia
E muitas coisas trazia de lá
Seu nome era Pablo e ele dizia
Que um negócio ele ia começar

E o Santo Cristo até a morte trabalhava
Mas o dinheiro não dava pra ele se alimentar
E ouvia às sete horas o noticiário
Que sempre dizia que o seu ministro ia ajudar

Mas ele não queria mais conversa
E decidiu que, como Pablo, ele ia se virar
Elaborou mais uma vez seu plano santo
E sem ser crucificado, a plantação foi começar

Logo logo os maluco da cidade souberam da novidade
""Tem bagulho bom ai!""
E João de Santo Cristo ficou rico
E acabou com todos os traficantes dali

Fez amigos, frequentava a Asa Norte
E ia pra festa de rock, pra se libertar
Mas de repente
Sob uma má influência dos boyzinho da cidade
Começou a roubar

Já no primeiro roubo ele dançou
E pro inferno ele foi pela primeira vez
Violência e estupro do seu corpo
""Vocês vão ver, eu vou pegar vocês""

Agora o Santo Cristo era bandido
Destemido e temido no Distrito Federal
Não tinha nenhum medo de polícia
Capitão ou traficante, playboy ou general

Foi quando conheceu uma menina
E de todos os seus pecados ele se arrependeu
Maria Lúcia era uma menina linda
E o coração dele pra ela o Santo Cristo prometeu

Ele dizia que queria se casar
E carpinteiro ele voltou a ser
""Maria Lúcia pra sempre vou te amar
E um filho com você eu quero ter""

O tempo passa e um dia vem na porta
Um senhor de alta classe com dinheiro na mão
E ele faz uma proposta indecorosa
E diz que espera uma resposta, uma resposta do João

""Não boto bomba em banca de jornal
Nem em colégio de criança isso eu não faço não
E não protejo general de dez estrelas
Que fica atrás da mesa com o cu na mão

E é melhor senhor sair da minha casa
Nunca brinque com um Peixes de ascendente Escorpião""
Mas antes de sair, com ódio no olhar, o velho disse
""Você perdeu sua vida, meu irmão""

""Você perdeu a sua vida meu irmão
Você perdeu a sua vida meu irmão
Essas palavras vão entrar no coração
Eu vou sofrer as consequências como um cão""

Não é que o Santo Cristo estava certo
Seu futuro era incerto e ele não foi trabalhar
Se embebedou e no meio da bebedeira
Descobriu que tinha outro trabalhando em seu lugar

Falou com Pablo que queria um parceiro
E também tinha dinheiro e queria se armar
Pablo trazia o contrabando da Bolívia
E Santo Cristo revendia em Planaltina

Mas acontece que um tal de Jeremias,
Traficante de renome, apareceu por lá
Ficou sabendo dos planos de Santo Cristo
E decidiu que, com João ele ia acabar

Mas Pablo trouxe uma Winchester-22
E Santo Cristo já sabia atirar
E decidiu usar a arma só depois
Que Jeremias começasse a brigar

Jeremias, maconheiro sem-vergonha
Organizou a Rockonha e fez todo mundo dançar
Desvirginava mocinhas inocentes
Se dizia que era crente mas não sabia rezar

E Santo Cristo há muito não ia pra casa
E a saudade começou a apertar
""Eu vou me embora, eu vou ver Maria Lúcia
Já tá em tempo de a gente se casar""

Chegando em casa então ele chorou
E pro inferno ele foi pela segunda vez
Com Maria Lúcia Jeremias se casou
E um filho nela ele fez

Santo Cristo era só ódio por dentro
E então o Jeremias pra um duelo ele chamou
Amanhã às duas horas na Ceilândia
Em frente ao lote 14, é pra lá que eu vou

E você pode escolher as suas armas
Que eu acabo mesmo com você, seu porco traidor
E mato também Maria Lúcia
Aquela menina bosal pra quem jurei o meu amor

E o Santo Cristo não sabia o que fazer
Quando viu o repórter da televisão
Que deu notícia do duelo na TV
Dizendo a hora e o local e a razão

No sábado então, às duas horas,
Todo o povo sem demora foi lá só para assistir
Um homem que atirava pelas costas
E acertou o Santo Cristo, começou a sorrir

Sentindo o sangue na garganta,
João olhou pras bandeirinhas e pro povo a aplaudir
E olhou pro sorveteiro e pras câmeras e
A gente da TV que filmava tudo ali

E se lembrou de quando era uma criança
E de tudo o que vivera até ali
E decidiu entrar de vez naquela dança
""Se a via-crucis virou circo, estou aqui""

E nisso o sol cegou seus olhos
E então Maria Lúcia ele reconheceu
Ela trazia a Winchester-22
A arma que seu primo Pablo lhe deu

""Jeremias, eu sou homem. coisa que você não é
E não atiro pelas costas não
Olha pra cá filha da puta, sem-vergonha
Dá uma olhada no meu sangue e vem sentir o teu perdão""

E Santo Cristo com a Winchester-22
Deu cinco tiros no bandido traidor
Maria Lúcia se arrependeu depois
E morreu junto com João, seu protetor

E o povo declarava que João de Santo Cristo
Era santo porque sabia morrer
E a alta burguesia da cidade
Não acreditou na história que eles viram na TV

E João não conseguiu o que queria
Quando veio pra Brasília, com o diabo ter
Ele queria era falar pro presidente
Pra ajudar toda essa gente que só faz

Why you all in my business
Why you really really want to know the 4-1-1
Is it cause that my game's tight
I can scoop a bitch and fuck her on the same night

It was a, Saturday evening bout seven at night
White T, white thongs pockets feeling alright
I got a, call from one of my caramel chicks
She said I mean be careful I think they talking on some hate shit
Despite the talk of the town, I'ma be there
For 45 minutes when you hear the horn come down
And when she climbed in, I received a kiss and a hug
In a minute take off your shoes on a white persian rug
Wave your number rolling going to get bent
Why they sure call thugs mugging I see him right through the tent
He had the nerve enough to tap on my glass
But he ain't had enough light to peek in but I almost blast his ass
Is it cause that I'm known to bust
So quick to bump a bad bitch that y'all known to trust
So when you see me on them thangs in the Cadillac truck
Man don't even know me when you see your bitch in the back or front

While these bitches trying to find out who am I screwing
And I'm so, sick and tired of the motherfucking gossip
And I'm, sick and tired of the motherfucking coppers
They actually post up at the end of my block
Take a hoe from her spot just for trying to plot

And I'm like, damn friendly why you all on me
Man I'm out here slanging records shit I stopped selling weed
Tell me, are you mad cause you see what I drive
Or are you checking out these broads with the big ass thighs
It be my main bitch, getting on my last nerves
closest now to the edge from getting kicked to the curb
She got a homegirl, all up in her hair
Maybe they just meant my hair's longer than her's

And I'm, sick of them haters that be all in my shit
Everytime I turn around somebody always be talking bout Twist
Want to know who got a baby by me, what does he drive, where my tip
Be all in my bidness because they heard that I've been bumping they chick
I ain't no lie, if I scoop your bitch up
I will, If I get scratch from her
Fold it up, if I tell her bend over
She won't get up, if I give up the bunch
What you need to know fo', you the player po-po
Steady beeking and poking paranoia smoking on too much doe-doe
Creeping all in my bid' no since I first splurged on a Rego
I got birds when I see you, I'm starting to think you work for them people
Hurt 'em when I tell 'em, I think you better ease up, cause everybody

Until you hip lock and freeze up, you might as well
Turn around and go like the other way when I see you

When she pulled her pants down 
Made me want to buck she oh my, what a surprise
Man I'm hoping, she'll let a nigga get it wet I gets wild and open
Way too provoking, on the beach rubbing her body down with suntan lotion
What's that, another tat with the Playboy bunny by her cootie cat
Got one going in the crack of her ass

Leif Wennerström,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break!

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who

Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart but
He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not

Respect yourself, hey, hey

Ela, era ela era ela no centro da tela daquela manhã
 tudo o que não era ela se desvaneceu 
Cristo, montanhas, florestas, acácias, ipês  
Pranchas coladas na crista das ondas, 
 as ondas suspensas no are
 pássaros cristalizados no branco do céu
 e eu, atolado na areia, perdia meus pés
  Músicas imaginei , mas o assombro gelou 
Na minha boca-as palavras que-eu ia falar
 nem uma brisa soprou
 enquanto Renata Maria saía do mar

  Dia após dia na praia com olhos vazados de já não a ver 
Quieto como um pescador a juntar seus anzóis
 ou como algum salva-vidas no banco dos réus
  Noite na praia deserta deserta deserta, daquela mulher
 praia repleta de rastros em mil direções
 penso que todos os passos perdidos são meus
  Eu já sabia, meu Deus , tão fulgurante visão 
 não se produz duas vezes num mesmo lugar 
Mas que danado fui eu
 enquanto Renata Maria saía do mar
Saía do mar

You find da world
Guess it's over
You'll find da space
Then you'll find stars
You look at the sun
And you see a light
You look into my eyes
Then you'll find me mind!

Yeaaaaaaaaaaah hey!
You make me crazy!!

Oh it's so cold
When rain falls
Got stupid brain
When I'm on da train
I was stupid child
And I'm still stupid now
My head hit da ball
And da ball hit da ground

Yeaaaaaaaaaaah hey!
You make me crazy!!

Get up I'm ready !
Get up there!
Cum on alone!
Get up won't you get up and down?
Stop!

You make me crazy!",On the Eastside
Lejit,"I saw you dancing out the ocean
Running fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flying from your hands

In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Baby you're the one

There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel

For each man in his time is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long lost heart within his reach",The One
Leland Martin,"He worked the same job
For twenty-two long years
Driving eighteen wheels
Down the road

He was only three away
Before his pension paid
On that cold and rainy day
They let him go

He had Mastercard and Visa
American Express, a brand new car
And a mortgage on his home

Collectors called and treated him
Like he was a thief
And he wondered how
To pull that heavy load

And he pledged his allegiance
And put in his time
Just to lose to a number
On the bottom line

Of a laptop computer
Somewhere in L.A
O' say can you see
He's American made

Now the pedal's to the metal
And he ain't slowin' down
Keepin' faith in pride
He never once gave up

He's got a mint 359
And painted on the side
Is his own name
And the words
""In god we trust""

Yeah, he pledged his allegiance
And put in his time
Just to lose to a number
On the bottom line

Of a laptop computer
Somewhere in L.A
Oh you can't keep him down
He's American made

Oh he's proud to be
American made

Un altro inverno, il tempo scorre sempre più veloce
Chissà se mai riascolteranno ancora la mia voce

(Desperation's gonna, take me all the way)
(Desperation's gonna, take me all the way)

Life can come up creeping
It takes me by surprise
Seductive, the base don't just disguise

With the colored future
And all that it might hold
But I'm sure you might have heard
All that glitters ain't gold

Tripped on my stepping stone
Got up, and kept on going
Just me, travelling alone

Wake up another day
I need to find my way home
Just me, travelling alone

Tripped on my stepping stone
Got up, and kept on going
Just me, travelling alone

Wake up another day
I need to find my way home
Just me, travelling alone

Tripped on my stepping stone
Got up, and kept on going
Just me, travelling alone (in desperation)

Wake up another day
I need to find my way home
Just me, travelling alone

Mother Mother said there's far too many of you crying.
All you need is love I believe in love

Can't explain all the feelings that you're making me feel
My heart's in overdrive and you're behind the steering wheel
Listen

Touching you, touching me
Touching you, God you're touching me

I believe in a thing called love
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart
There's a chance we could make it now
We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down
I believe in a thing called love
Ooh!

I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day
You got me in a spin but everything is A.OK!

Touching you, touching me
Touching you, God you're touching me

I believe in a thing called love
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart
There's a chance we could make it now
We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down
I believe in a thing called love
Ooh! Guitar!

Touching you, touching me
Touching you, God you're touching me

I believe in a thing called love
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart
There's a chance we could make it now
We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down
I believe in a thing called love
Ooh!

Lemar,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
(I bless the rain)
I bless the rains down in Africa
(I bless the rain)
I bless the rains down in Africa

Lemar,"I would stay up all night
Just thinking of you
All the funny things you say,
The silly things you do

Like when you're mad at me
And you hang up the phone
When I tell you no-one's here
And I'm all alone 

Tell me what will it take
To prove my love to you?
I would find the man who
Walked a thousand miles

And I'd walk in his shoes

Keep moving on

And I promise I will never lie

One thing I know deep
In my heart is
I won't ever make you cry
Said I'm trying to make

You understand
I only want to treat you right
If my love was like the rain lady
I would rain on you through
The night 

Tell me what will it take

Yourself to treat her like that
After all you put her through she shouldn't take you back

Something that I fail
To understand is why
Some men don't know it when
They got a good woman
Lie to her, cheat on her,
Got the nerve to beat
Up on a good woman

Don't even want to let her go out
Gets vex when the
Friends come around
He can't see what
He is doing to her
He's taking all the self esteem
From this beautiful queen

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya

Got to ring you to I lie
It would have been a great November
It was like our love had been reborn
Can't explain the happiness in her voice that day
It made everything make sense
Even though I never knew your name
Now on every night I dry my weeping eyes

Don't think time could ever heal this pain, oh
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one to blame
I can't believe

I can't believe you've gone away
Life will never be the same
And ill meet you on the other side
And if I see you will you
Call me daddy
I can't believe you've gone away
Wish that I cud see your face
And ill meet you on the other side
And if I see you will you
Call me daddy

Every single day was filled with oh so many choices
Wish it was a boy or girl
Someone who would change the world
Used to say that you would grow to be my baby boo
She already had it all planned
You would be a perfect match
Raised with a loving hand
I will never know you or hold you within these arms

Sometimes she thinks that she's the one to blame, no
Can someone tell me how to stop her pain?

If you were here right now life would not be complicated
I'd give my heart and soul just to see you grow

Why won't you just do it now?

That's why i love having you around

I've been spending way too much time with you
Haven't really done nothing wrong yet, but I'm about to
Maybe we should think about what we both could do, could do
Don't want to be a fool
What is, is what is

Maybe this was meant to be
Maybe we should try and see
Maybe just maybe it's as far as we should go
Maybe it's a big mistake
Maybe we should walk away
Maybe just maybe we'll never know

I know I really love my girl, you say you love your man
So how did we end up here?
Where was there a change of plan?
We've been fighting for so long, it gets harder everytime
You know if we take it there, we might regret it the rest of our lives, our lives
Don't want to be a fool
What is, is what is

Girl, I know in my heart I should leave
But it's so hard to let you go, oh
It's so hard to let you go
How can we just ignore how we feel?
It could be something we want to forget, but it just might be for real

Put my shoes on,
Off to work

He treats you like a fool 
When you were hurting baby, I was broken too 
And I can't go on this way

Visions seek me out at night
They don't know that I'm over you

Over you, over you
Getting over you, over you
That's what I do

Hopes and ideas still lingering here
They don't know that I'm over you
That tingling down my spine whenever you would come around
Don't know that I'm over you

See anyone can tell just by looking at me
Everything's getting better
I'm getting there slowly by bits and degrees
Everything's getting better, better

Over you, over you
I'm getting over you, over you
That's what I do

Do, do, do, do, I do, do, do, do
I do, do, do, do, I do, do, do, do, I do

I tell the butterflies up in here for no apparent reason that
That I'm getting over you
I tell my way my heart prepare for yet another season
'Cause I'm getting over you

Tell the mourners in black get out of my room
And don't come back 'cause I'm getting over you
And that sad eyed hound follow me all over town
But I'm getting over

See anyone can tell just by looking at me
My wounds are getting better
As I sit here I learn more about me
My life is getting better, better

Over you, over you
Getting over you, over you

Over you, over you
Getting over you, over you
That's what I do, that's what I do

Have the angels turned their back on me

And though my cries have gone unheard and I'm left on my knees
It feels like the weight of the world
'cause I still remember how it felt
When you loved me... when you loved me oh...

Verse:
I got no rule to follow
Left with no eyes to see
No love to borrow,
Since you left I can barely breathe
In my lonely place and it can't be traced
All I can do is pray...

Can you hear me ohh

I might be wrong cos I can feel it happening

So I stopped holding on and then you came along

In love again cos that was the only one for me
And now I feel that you have come and saved me

Nervous tension

Nervous tension
Is an unseen enemy of the human mind
Nervous tension can cause you
To lack confidence in yourself
To lose your concentration
And to be inefficient in your work

Nervous tension can prevent you from relaxing
To spoil your leisure hours
And rob you of the sleep you need at night
Nervous tension

Nervous tension

The purpose of this record
Is to train you in the art of relaxing
Both your mind and your body
Use it regularly

Train your mind through repetition
To follow the suggestions
And then you'll be ready to progress
To side two

The mind remains tense
When it is restlessly
Turning over personal problems
Worrying about financial matters

Or the conflicts of daytime plight
Or fretting over the troubles of the world
A mind so strained and tense
Cannot relax even in sleep

Night passes in uneasy dreams
The body is not refreshed as it should be
But you can overcome this difficulty
If you thoroughly relax your mind
Before you go to bed

Better still, you can learn to relax
From time to time during the day
So that nervous tension never builds up
To an unpleasant degree

Nervous tension
Nervous tension

You will carefully plan your course through life
You will think about your plan
Think about your interests
Think with the pleasure
Of the satisfaction you will feel

As the plan becomes reality
You will firmly imprint in your mind this phrase
""I maintain, at all times
A calm, confident, cheerful state of mind""
You will repeat it aloud to yourself
At least three times daily

You will give your mind and body
The rest they need to restore energy
Very shortly you will no longer
Need to listen to my voice

You will absorb and understand
The suggestions I have given you
And you will learn to give them to yourself

The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true",When You Wish upon a Star
Lemuel West,"Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow",Will You Love Me Tomorrow

Sometimes you just get so damn tired 
And things really ain't that cool 
But it's normal  man 
You can't let it slow up your pattern 
Somedays the pressure can really be on you 
And you might not know what to do about it 
You might get a little clausterphobic  
Problems closin' in on ya 
But you just gotta relax  man 
Plan your attack  man 
I mean  we all got struggles 
Though you can't win em all 
'Cause life is hard as granite for some of us 
But you just gotta let it ride, man, and ride with it 
'Cause some things only happen when you let it 
If you lose your head too fast, you might live to regret it 
So listen, man, listen 
So when you feel so way out 
And you feel like there's no way out 
You just gotta open your eyes, man, and rise 
Sometimes you just gotta give thanks when you're walkin' slanted 
Ya can't take your blessings for granted 
So keep a good focus, stay cool, stay true 
And just let the sun shine right on through

You went as far as it goes  
As good as you can't complain  
But you're still all alone  and it all still seems the same  
Maybe it's not the way and it shouldn't have gone this far  
Willingness and sudden greed made it all that much too hard. 

See me sad; that would make you mad and a hunch that made a pain  
It's true that the way you made me makes me fear a sudden change

It was a dream of rock and roll and we're giving gifted time, 
and the funky didn't matter, all just beats and rhymes
So we made a bust on Blackie Street and parked it, and we knew that we had to be as dope as the Ill Fresh Juice-school
There was DJ Swagg, Cut Master Cool B, and my mind was Melly Mel and Biz Markie
We were only and just young, so who would've thought today that we would tell you that it happened this way

To my man Biz, it's all for you
Thanks for putting out the records guide the way that you do
You keep going off 'cause you just try to follow so when you broke us down, to our last hip talent
So, you gotta cheer when better chords get near, that's what we're dream of with our samples
There's so many blacky jerkits then there're people on their seats, and it's digitalized beats

All the people in the place rockin' (coast to coast)
Put your best foot forward and (rock the house)
And if your feelin' this you better let me (hear ya shout)

Mr. Dibbs is on the cut, cut, cut

When we were young, we started in the streets, we never thought that there'd be a day that we would be
So when it was time, we made a Biz to jump backs, we laid tracks while the later hours
Now so keep on rockin' 'cause no one beats the Biz, the rest is just the fakers that the way it is
This is going on but you think we should be there, who is Biz (oh he's just a friend)

Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tare in a staring under heat
Involved an under usual feet

Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face 
That she keeps in a jar by the door

Where do they all belong?

Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near

In the night when there's nobody there

So nice to meet you
I think I’ve seen you before here

You look amazing

Can I get you a drink?
Should we hit the dance floor?

I wish I wore my new dress

No surprises because we’ve been there
Because we’ve done this, we’ve got the shirt

Lena,"Qué sensación tan extraña 
Aquella que sentí 
Al escuchar tu corazón 
Que falsedad la que engaña 
A todos en aquel viejo salón 

Por eso yo ya no se 
Qué voy a hacer sin tu amor 
Si no puedo escapar de esta llama que incendia mi cuerpo 

Yo ya no intento descubrir qué pasará 
Si prefiero morir que aguantar lo que siento 
Todo lo que yo llevo lo llevo por dentro 

Qué sensación tan extraña 
Llegó sin avisar 
Y acorraló mi corazón 
Qué escondes dentro de tu alma? 
Que me hace alucinar 
Y hasta perder la razón 

Por eso yo ya no sé qué voy a hacer sin tu amor 
Si no puedo escapar de esta llama que incendia mi cuerpo 
Yo ya no intento descubrir qué pasará 
Pues prefiero morir que aguantar lo que siento 
Todo lo que yo lo llevo por dentro 

Y grito a voces que te quiero 
Que me condenen a 100 años 
Que me destierren, si te beso 
Que me castigue Dios si peco (ay! si peco) 
Y grito a voces que te quiero! 
 
Que me condenen a 100 años 
Que me destierren, si te beso 
Que me castigue Dios si peco (ay! si peco) 
Y grito a voces que te quiero! 

Qué angustia siento en el alma 
Pues tengo que escuchar 
Cuando enverdad  quiero gritar 
Qué misteriosa la calma 
Se oculta en el umbral 
De mi ansiedad 

Por eso yo ya no se qué voy a hacer (ya no sé que voy a hacer) 
Sin tu amor (sin tu amor) 
Si no puedo escapar de esta llama que incendia mi cuerpo (mi cuerpo) 
Yo ya no intento descubrir qué pasará 
Si prefiero morir que aguantar lo que siento

Lena Ericsson,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Lena Ericsson,"We were more than lovers,
We were more than sweethearts,
It's so hard to understand.

Don't know why it happened,
Don't know how it started,
Why should we be strangers,
After all we planned.

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,
People stop an' stare,
It's so hard to bear,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town

Every time we meet,
My heart skips a beat,
We don't stop to speak,
'Though it's just a week,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town
 
We send out invitations,
To friends and relations,
Announcing our weddin' day
Friends and our relations,
Gave congratulations,
How can you face them?
What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?

Cause your daddy's all alone
I have tried in vain
Never no more to call your name

When you left you broke my heart
Because I never thought we'd part
Every hour in the day
You will hear me say:
""Baby come home""","Baby, Won't You Please Come Home?"
Lena Horne,"I have dreamed that your arms are lovely
And I have dreamed what a joy you'll be
I have dreamed every word you'll whisper
When you're close, close to me

How you look in the glow of evening
I have dreamed and enjoyed the view
In these dreams I've loved you so
That by now I think I know
What it's like to be loved by you

To bow out gracefully
Though you hold the key but baby

Whenever you want me I'll be there
Whenever you need me I'll be there

And love can burn once again

Lena Horne,"Is it an earthquake or simply a shock?
Is it the good turtle soup or merely the mock?
Is it a cocktail, this feeling of joy?
Or is what i feel the real McCoy?

Is it for all time or simply a lark?
Is it Granada i see or only Asbury park?
Is it a fancy not worth thinking of?
Or is it at long last love?

Lena Horne,"After one whole quart of brandy,
Like a daisy I'm awake.
With no Bromo Seltzer handy,
I don't even shake.

Men are not a new sensation,
I've done pretty well I think,
But this half pint imitation
Put me on the blink.

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

I lost my heart, but what of it, he is cold I agree
He might laugh, but I love it, although the laugh's on me.

I'll sing to him, bring spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I. 

He's a fool and don't I know it,
But a fool can have his charms,
I'm in love and don't I know it,
Like a babe in arms.

Love's the same old sad sensation,
Lately I've not slept a wink,
Since this half pint imitation,
Put me on the blink.

I've sinned a lot, I mean a lot,
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot,
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

I'll sing to him, each spring to him,
And worship the trousers that cling to him.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

When he talks, he is seeking,
Words to get,.off his chest.
Horizontally speaking
He's at his very best.

Vexed again, perplexed again,
Thank god I can be oversexed again.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

Wise at last, my eyes at last,
Are cutting you down to your size at last,
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more.

Burned a lot but learned a lot,
And now you are broke so you earned a lot,
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more.

Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic,
Life was so hard to bear,
Now my heart's antiseptic,
Since you moved out of there.

Romance finis.
Your chance finis.
Those ants that invaded my pants finis.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more.","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"
Lena Horne,"The farce was ended,
The curtains drawn,
And I at least pretended
That love was dead and gone.

But now, from nowhere,
You come to me as before
To take my heart,
And break my heart once more.

Get out of town
Before it's too late, my love.
Get out of town,
Be good to mr please!

Why wish me harm?
Why not retire to a farm
And be contented to charm
The birds off the trees?

Just disappear,
I care for you much too much,
And when you are near,
Close to me dear,
We touch too much!

The thrill when we meet
Is so bitter-sweet
That, darling, it's getting me down;
So on your mark,
Get set,
Get out of town!",Get Out of Town
Lena Horne,"What have I got that the others ain't
That always seems to please
T'ain't my perfume, nor my fancy paint
But when I charm the men all swarm 
Just like they was bees

There's honey in the honeycomb
There's sugar in the cane
There's oysters in a real oyster stew
And bubbles in sweet Champagne

There's jelly in the jellyroll
And sap in every tree
There's honey in the honeycomb
And, Honey, there's love in me

There's honey in the honeycomb
There's nectar in the peach
There's candy in a coconut shell
And mussels on every beach

There's money in the savings bank
And I personally guarantee
If there's honey in the honeycomb
Then, Baby, there's love in me",Honey in the Honeycomb
Lena Horne,"I was resting comfortably, face down in the gutter
Life was serene, I knew where I was at
""There's no hope for him,"" my dearest friends would mutter
I was something dragged in by the cat. Then

Just in time, I found you just in time
Before you came my time was running low
I was lost, the losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed, nowhere to go

Now you're here and now I know just where I'm going
No more doubt or fear, I found my way
For love came just in time, you found me just in time
And changed my lonely life that lovely day",Just in Time
Lena Horne,"Love is real, real is love
Love is feeling, feeling love
Love is wanting to be loved

Love is touch, touch is love
Love is reaching, reaching love
Love is asking to be loved

Love is you
You and me
Love is knowing
We can be

Love is free, free is love
Love is living, living love
Love is needing to be loved",Love
Lena Horne,"Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
And your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove

Well, sweetheart, they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love",People Will Say We're in Love
Lena Horne,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.
Speak low when you speak, love,

Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.
Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,

Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, everything ends

Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low

Lena Horne,"I wanna be around to pick up the pieces
When somebody breaks your heart
Some somebody twice as smart as I

A somebody who will swear to be true
As you used to do with me
Who'll leave you to learn
That misery loves company, wait and see

I mean, I wanna be around to see how he does it
When he breaks your heart to bits
Let's see if the puzzle fits so fine

And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet

As our Lord, free us of wrath,
Since times of our fathers He hath
Promised to spare all mankind!

Why my motor skills are out of face

It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings

It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights

We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down

Lena Horne,"When I take you out, tonight, with me,
Honey, here's the way it's goin' to be:
You will set behind a team of snow white horses,
In the slickest gig you ever see!

Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters

When I drive them high steppin' strutters.
Nosey pokes'll peek thru' their shutters and their eyes will pop!
The wheels are yeller, the upholstery's brown,
The dashboard's genuine leather,

With isinglass curtains y' can roll right down,
In case there's a change in the weather.
Two bright sidelight's winkin' and blinkin',
Ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinkin'

You c'n keep your rig if you're thinkin' 'at I'd keer to swap
Fer that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top! Did you say 
the fringe was made of silk
Wouldn't have no other kind but silk

Does it really have a team of snow white horses
One's like snow, the other's more like milk
All the world'll fly in a flurry
When I take you out in the surrey,

When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
When we hit that road, hell fer leather,
Cats and dogs'll dance in the heather,
Birds and frogs'll sing all together and the toads will hop!

The wind'll whistle as we rattle along,
The cows'll moo in the clover,
The river will ripple out a whispered song,
And whisper it over and over:

Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever and ud never stop
In that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top!

I can see the stars gettin' blurry,
When we drive back home in the surrey,
Drivin' slowly home in the surrey with the fringe on top!
I can feel the day gettin' older,

Feel a sleepy head on my shoulder,
Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!
The sun is swimmin' on the rim of a hill;
The moon is takin' a header,

And jist as I'm thinkin' all the earth is still,
A lark'll wake up in the medder.
Hush, you bird, my baby's a-sleepin'!
Maybe got a dream worth a-keepin'

Whoa! you team, and jist keep a-creepin' at a slow clip clop.
Don't you hurry with the surrey with the fringe on the top!",The Surrey With the Fringe on Top

Lena Horne,"On the day I was born, 
said my father, said he,
I've an elegant legacy 
waiting for ye.
Tis a rhyme for your lips 
and a song for your heart,
To sing whenever the world falls apart.

Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow it over the hill and stream.
Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.

'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child.
Oh, the lure of that song 
Kept her feet running wild.
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill.

So, I bundled me heart and I roamed the world free.
To the east with the lark
Tow the west with the sea.
And I searched all the world and I scanned all the skies.
But I found it at last in my own true love's eyes.",Look to the Rainbow
Lena Horne,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

Oh, it's a long long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And you ain't got time for waiting game

When days dwindle down to a precious few
September November,
And these few golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I share with you

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Maybe I am living in the past
But when I meet the right one
I know that I'll be true
My first love will be the last

When I fall in love it will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it began
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never, never, never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I give my heart to you

And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I give my heart to you",When I Fall in Love
Lena Horne,"The party's over, the game is ended, 
the dreams I dreamed went up in smoke.
They didn't pan out as I had intended; 
I should know how to take a joke.

I'll go my way by myself, this is the end of romance. 
I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance. 
I'll try to apply myself and teach my heart to sing. 
I'll go my way by myself like a bird on the wing,
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.
I'll go my way by myself, here's how the comedy ends. 
I'll have to deny myself love and laughter and friends.
Grey clouds in sky above have put a blot on my fun. 
I'll try to fly high above for a place in the sun.
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone",By Myself

Keeps draggin' my poor heart around

Is misery

Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he, for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong,  the man I love
And when he comes my way,
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.

He'll build a little home just meant for two
From which I'll never roam, who would? would you?

Boy, how they could love!
Swore to be true to each other,
True as the stars above!
'Cause he was her man,
But he done her wrong!

One night Frankie happened to pass by the hotel;
Just casually glanced into a window so high,
And who did she see but her lovin' man
Lovin' up old Nellie Bligh!
She caught her man
Doin' her wrong!

Well, she went round the corner to her favourite pawn shop;
This time she didn't go there for fun!
'Cause when she left, underneath her long red kimono,
She was totin' a forty-four gun!
She was gunnin' for her man
Who was doin' her wrong!

Then back Frankie dashed to that hotel,
Started yankin' the bell!
She said, ""Stand back, you madam and floozies,
Or I'll blow each and every one of you straight to hell!
I want my man
Who's done me wrong!"".

Johnnie, in panic, mounted the staircase,
Screamin', ""Oh Frankie, don't shoot!""
Three times she pulled a trigger on a forty-four gun,
The gun went, ""Root-toot-toot!"".
She nailed her man
Who'd done her wrong!

So they put her away in a dungeon,
Way up in a dark dingy cell
In the south east corner of a jail,
Where the wind seemed to blow straight from hell!
For killin' her man
Who done her wrong!

But the day Frankie mounted the scaffold,
She was just as calm as any gal could be!
And raising her eyes to heaven she cried,
""Lord, I'm comin' to thee!
I'm sorry I killed my man
Who done me wrong!"".",Frankie and Johnny

It's not necessary to move
Don't move, why move

It may be crowded

And cling to each other
And you know how one step
Can lead to another

Oh, there's nothing wrong with
A waltz or fandango
But oh, what can come from
A new fangled tango

You cling to your partner
And sway to the rhythm
You can't lose your partner
'Cause you're right there with him

You don't have to be worry
About fast or slow steps
The nice part about it
In this dance, you don't need steps

You don't have to worry
If your dancing won't do
It's not what you do do
It's more what you don't do

Or a fancy fandango
You just need a man

What good is money if your heart isn't light
And here in your arms I'm wealthy tonight
When youth has its fling, love is the thing

While others fight for power
We can walk among the flowers
Knowing that the best thing in life
Is the thing that is free
Love for you and me

And even though our castles crumble and fall
We have the right to laugh at them all
For love is still king, love is the thing

And then I understand. mm
Her eyes afire with one desire

Her kiss, each fond caress
They lead the way to happiness
She takes me to paradise

Lena Horne,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

Boy, how they could love!
Swore to be true to each other,
True as the stars above!

But he done her wrong!

One night Frankie happened to pass by the hotel;
Just casually glanced into a window so high,
And who did she see but her lovin' man
Lovin' up old Nellie Bligh!
She caught her man
Doin' her wrong!

Well, she went round the corner to her favourite pawn shop;
This time she didn't go there for fun!
'Cause when she left, underneath her long red kimono,
She was totin' a forty-four gun!
She was gunnin' for her man
Who was doin' her wrong!

Then back Frankie dashed to that hotel,
Started yankin' the bell!
She said, ""Stand back, you madam and floozies,
Or I'll blow each and every one of you straight to hell!
I want my man
Who's done me wrong!"".

Johnnie, in panic, mounted the staircase,
Screamin', ""Oh Frankie, don't shoot!""
Three times she pulled a trigger on a forty-four gun,
The gun went, ""Root-toot-toot!"".
She nailed her man
Who'd done her wrong!

So they put her away in a dungeon,
Way up in a dark dingy cell
In the south east corner of a jail,
Where the wind seemed to blow straight from hell!
For killin' her man
Who done her wrong!

But the day Frankie mounted the scaffold,
She was just as calm as any gal could be!
And raising her eyes to heaven she cried,
""Lord, I'm comin' to thee!
I'm sorry I killed my man
Who done me wrong!"".",Frankie & Johnny

Lena Horne,"I feel so smoochie
When I hold your hand and look in your eye.
I feel so smoochie
When I touch your lips, then I realise
That to hold you near
Make rainbows appear,
And life is just one long kiss;
While the moon look down
And the stars kind of frown,
And say, ""Golly, look what we miss!"".

I feel so smoochie;
When the night is cool it's always warm here with you.
I feel so smoochie,
And a seat for one becomes a love seat for two!
And I know my career
Starts and ends right here,
Right in your lovin' arms!
Smoochie little girl me,
Smoochie old gal to you!

I feel so smoochie
When you hold me tight and muss up my hair.
I feel so smoochie,
A romantic song becomes our love affair;
And a ride in our jeep
While the kiddie's asleep
Ends with parking at some dark kerb;
Then a sleepy old bird
Whispers 'round the word,
And says, ""Quiet!  Please don't disturb!"".

I feel so smoochie
When I dream all day of lovin' you at night.
I feel so smoochie,
Both my feet are wrong but I feel so right!
Then I know my career
Starts and ends right here,
Right in your lovin' arms!
Smoochie little girl me,
Smoochie old gal to you!",I Feel So Smoochie

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Lena Horne,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an 'Oh, beg your pardon'
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream.

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said 'May I have the next one'
In my frightened arms, those polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled round a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we crowded over the floor.
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilac and laughter
I know the meaning of the words 'ever after'
And I'll always see those polka dots and moonbeams 
When I kiss my pug-nosed dream

Lena Horne,"One one summer's day,
Sun was shinin' fine,
The lady love of old Bill Bailey
Was hangin' clothes on the line
In her back yard,
And weepin' hard.
She married a B&O brakeman
That took and throwed her down,
Bellerin' like a prune-fed calf
With a big gang hanging round
And to that crowd,
She hollered loud: 
Refrain:
Won't you come home, Bill Bailey
Won't you come home?
She moans the whole day long.
I'll do the cookin', darling
I'll pay the rent,
I know I've done you wrong;
'member that rainy eve that
I threw you out,
With nothing but a fine-tooth comb?
I know I'm to blame,
Well, ain't that a shame
Bill Bailey won't you please come home. 

Bill drove by that door
In an automobile,
A great big diamond, coach and footman
Hear that lady squeal.
He's all alone
I heard her groan.
She hollered through the door

Stop a minute, listen to me
Won't I see you no more?

Easy as a dream up into my room.
And before I realized the danger
I found myself looking into your eyes.
Somewhere in their colours I saw promises
Of things I'd never seen before
It's all over, I've got to have you.

Holding onto talking, saying nothing.
Knowing in a moment I could lose you.
Then without a warning I remembered that
You trembled at the touch of my hand.
Knowing when you came to me that no one else
Would ever feel the same in my arms

Wakin' in the morning to the tenderness
Of holding you asleep in my arms.

I've grown accustomed to her face.
She almost makes the day begin.
I've grown accustomed to the tune
That she whistles night and noon.
Her smiles, her frowns,
Her ups, her downs
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I was serenely independent
And content before we met.
Surely I could always be that way again - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to her look,
Accustomed to her voice,
Accustomed to her face.

Marry Freddy. What an infantile idea. What a heartless,
wicked, brainless thing to do. But she'll regret it. It's
doomed before they even take the vow.

I can see her now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill,
In a wretched little flat above a store.
I can see her now, not a penny in the till,
And a bill collector beating at the door.
She'll try to teach the things I taught her,
And end up selling flowers instead.
Begging for her bread and water,
While her husband has his breakfast in bed.

In a year or so, when she's prematurely grey,
And the blossom in her cheek has turned to chalk,
She'll come home and lo,
He'll have upped and run away,
With a social-climbing heiress from New York.
Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!

How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite,
Will I take her in or hurl her to the walls?
Give her kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take her back or throw the baggage out?

But, I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, never would,
Take a position and staunchly never budge.
A most forgiving man.

But I shall never take take her back
If she were even crawling on her knees.
Let her promise to atone,
Let her shiver, let her moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

Marry Freddy, HA!

But I'm so used to hear her day,
""Good morning"" every day.
Her joys, her woes,
Her highs, her lows,
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I'm very grateful she's a woman,
And so easy to forget, rather like a habit
One can always break - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to the trace,
Of something in the air,
Accustomed to her face.",I've Grown Accustomed to His Face

Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low

Lena Jansson,"Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

'Twas like a breath of spring, heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again?
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, I do love you""

I still recall the thrill, I guess that I always will
I hope 'twill never depart

Lena Jansson,"But I'm bidin' my time,
Cause that's the kinda guy I'm

Lena Jansson,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Above all, I want my arms about you!

Lena Jansson,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key

Lena Martell,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
Lena Martell,"Why me Lord, what have I ever done
To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth loving you
Or the kindness you've shown.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

Tell me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you.

Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.",Why Me Lord?
Lena Martell,"Once in your life you find her
Someone that turns your heart around

When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me, all you will see is a girl you once knew

At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change

Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom, running around trying everything new

The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise

I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions, they're not the solutions they promised to be

Lena Martell,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember

Lena Martell,"I cried a tear, you wiped it dry
I was confused, you cleared my mind
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me
And held me up and gave me dignity
Somehow you needed me

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me

And I can't believe it's you I can't believe it's true
I needed you and you were there
And I'll never leave, why should I leave, I'd be a fool 
'Cause I finally found someone who really cares

You held my hand when it was cold
When I was lost, you took me home
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again
You even called me friend

Maybe I didn't hold you

Stand up, don't hesitate

And get up on it 
Can you feel it 
How much do you want it 

One hit the more you want it 
The higher you'll get on it 
You know what you are 
You're a virgin superstar

Sex it up, just go crazy 
Quick, grab it while we can 
Load up your master plan 

Do you really want it bad enough 
And do anything to get that buzz 
Sleep and freak your way up 
With everyone 

Gotta keep the dream alive 
Don't want to end up a husband's wife 
That old trouble and strife 
Let your head down

Lene,"My dedication is to my art 
No education will buy my car 
Too much temptation and help too far away

We're so depressed, we wear our shades at night 
Without the stress, we just might fade away 

We want to party but we got no soul 
We want to start it, blow our senses out of control 
We want to make it but we got no way 
We're gonna hate it but we might just fake it today 
We want to party but we have no love 

Disillusioned with my dreams 
Got life confused with my designer jeans

Let's face the music - I think that it's time.
What's the use, when the future looks so unkind.
Life and death - the choice we make.
Revolution - the line in my mind takes.

Win or lose, hey! what do you say.
Got to change, change, change, change.
Check it out and see - there could be a better lifestyle.
My hopes are big as the sky,
My dreams are wider than wide.
One day we'll be absolutely crueltyfree!

Rage!
March on! unleash the spirit,
Rise above all fear, into the light.
It's a world affair - don't waste a minute,
Let the heart decide, it's time to care.

What is this sad fascination,
To rip off another's skin.
Shame! shame! shame!
Fancy people in furcoat - what a pitiful sight.
Leather is dead - it's not so nice.

Rage!
March on! unleash the spirit,
Rise above all fear, into the light.
It's a world affair - don't waste a minute,
Let the heart decide, it's time to care.

Stop! think! before you chew.
Don't eat a creature, that won't eat you.
Food for everyone,
Let's all eat - it's so much fun.
Let that chicken be! a cow is not a factory!
Fast food slaughter - a criminal waste.

Make some improvement on the human race.

Rage, it tears my heart apart.
Rage, each time I see the blood.

Rise above all fear, into the light.

Trying everything to succeed somehow.

It is there to keep you warm

Perhaps an open door
It invites you to come closer
It wants to show you more
And even if you lose yourself
And don't know what to do
The memory of love will see you through

Oh, love to some is like a cloud
To some as strong as steel
For some a way of living
For some a way to feel
And some say love is holding on
And some say letting go
And some say love is everything
And some say they don't know

Perhaps love is like the ocean

Like a fire when it's cold outside
Or thunder when it rains

Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me?

Through the door there came familiar laughter
I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh my friends were older but no wiser

We still don't know how
We're hoping we know what we do
Second nature comes along
We create, but lose control
We think we know what we do
I want to know the answer
I want to have my share
Where do we go from here
How can I pay my fare
How can I somehow disappear
For an endless time in space
With a brave new world to face
Simple peace can't be found
Inside our restless minds
Keep on hoping it's there
Take a number stand in line

Leningrad Cowboys,"Galina, a hard working boatman
But her husband, he was just too poor
Galina, got fed up with the hard life
So she nailed him to the bedroom floor
Down and out she sailed into the mist
Showing hairy breasts, and a giant fist
Watch out you lousy men,
Cause now she's really pissed
Galina, she is a crazy boatman
Her daughters, they are crazy too
Together, they sail across the ocean
They are searching for love and new tattoos
Up and down the coast they are raping men
Plundering the villages, and raping again
Spitting on the women, and stealing all they can
Galina the pirate of the Baltic sea
Scaring the sailors away
Galina the mistress of misery
Turning the blue skies to grey
Galina, she is a crazy boatman
An her daughters, they are crazy too
Lang ago she sailed into the mist
Showing hairy breasts and her giant fist
Watch out you lousy men,
Cause she's still very pissed

Ah, if I can spend it with you
Then the end of the world don't matter at all

At the end of the world
We will kiss for the last time
And we won't feel the earth collapse into
A mess of flood and fire

We'll be making love

Keep giving me love to find a way

I just need someone to say, everything's okay

And as the feeling grows
I can't deny push those thoughts aside

It's unexpected, it usually is
When you're rejected
Or you take a hit
Suddenly everything's thrown in a spin

They like to threaten the life that I know
They say get over here and get into the ring

My resistance is out on the town
I was alarmed by your attack
This isn't a boxing match

Some time without any bruises
You go and tell me the things that I don't want to hear
Putting your fist into my ears
Filling me up with the dread and the fear leaving you all in pieces

You were once a little baby
Full of optimistic wonder
So what got into you to make you think
That it could pull you under, honey

Could it be that we were under
The impression life was perfect?

We understood that every part of it hurts

Před probuzením a já spát chtěla dál

A pozemský čas v ten moment ztratil svůj krok
Ten okamžik trval celý světelný rok
Já byla jiná, tak náhle jiná
Zamilovaná

A jen protivný strach mně tížil ten ráj
Já už v podvědomí pila studený čaj
Nemilovaná
A jenom studené slunce má v záclonách kout
Pár nečtených knih mi musí připomenout
Jsem stále stejná, tak stále stejná
Nemilovaná

Jen z rádia hlas těší nás předpovědí počasí
Jenom ten hlas a nikdo víc nemluví
Když češu si vlasy

Já měla pocit, jako bych byla za školou
Jako vyhrát milion za noc minulou
Zamilovaná
Tak chyť mi ten sen a přijď, zavolej
A odpusť mi vše, na nic víc nečekej
Já už jsem jiná, tak náhle jiná
Zamilovaná

Nad hlavou vesmír a pod nohama zem
Jsem stále stejná, a přece jiná jsem
Zamilovaná
Kde teď můžeš být, že nesedíš vedle mě
Až tě dnes potkám, snad překvapí tě příjemně,
Že už jsem jiná, tak náhle jiná
Zamilovaná

Jen z rádia hlas těší nás předpovědí počasí
Jenom ten hlas a nikdo víc nemluví
Když češu si vlasy

Ten kratičký sen se mi k ránu až zdál
Před probuzením a já spát chtěla dál
Zamilovaná
A pozemský čas v ten moment ztratil svůj krok
Ten okamžik trval celý světelný rok
Já byla jiná, tak náhle jiná
Zamilovaná",Zamilovaná (Je l'Aime a 'mourir)
Lenka Filipová,"I realize the best part of love is the thinnest slice
And it don't count for much
But I'm not letting go
I believe there's still much to believe in

So lift your eyes if you feel you can
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan
I figured it out
What I needed was someone to show me

You know you can't fool me
I've been loving you too long
It started so easy
You want to carry on

Lost in love and I don't know much
Was I thinking aloud and fell out of touch? 
But I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?

We're only 17
So if love exists I will fall

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

Just one more kiss
To soothe the pain exists
In a world of lies
Misery take my shame and life

And everything fails a violent death
The smile you gave
Visit me in hell tonight
And say, ""If love exists, I will fall?

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
Almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

I'll wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

So I'm not in love
So I'm, I'm not in love
So I'm, I'm not in love
So I'm, I'm not in love

I feel so alive
I feel so alive tonight
I feel so alive
I feel so alive, can't stop this feeling

So alive, I feel so alive tonight
I feel so alive
I feel so alive, can't stop this feeling
If love exists, I will fall

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
Almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

Lennie Tristano,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me
Lennie Tristano,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way

Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all

Lennie Tristano,"We were more than lovers,
We were more than sweethearts,
It's so hard to understand.

Don't know why it happened,
Don't know how it started,
Why should we be strangers,
After all we planned.

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,

How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

You rip off my clothes as you rip off my life
Destroyed my world in a matter of words
You left me waiting, you left me undeciding
You left me waiting, you left me waiting

I hear the knock at the door 
And I don't care who's not there anymore
This sound is driving me insane
And damn it nothing's going my way

We're at the point of talking about the morning
Trying to decide who's going to go
I think you forgot whose bed you slept in
And who is going home

I'm running through the forest by myself
I'm walking over oceans to you
Hey ma, I'm walking on water
Hey God, I think I'm your son

And who is going home

Don't stand there looking at me
Don't stand there looking through me
Just take your clothes and I'll open the door
Looking around, you don't live here anymore

I don't know what I can do for you
I'm not sure what I can be for you
Over some table in someone else's kitchen

Here's something I've been meaning to say
Yeah it's true, I've been living my life through you
But you can't even do that right, you're not living it my way

She says thank you for never even caring
I'll plan to see you all in hell 
She sits there saying those stupid words over and over again
Thank you for destroying me

A cry rages out from a child
What do you mean by your life, can't something belong to me
I've given you everything, I've given you a daughter
But where is the mother I truly need

She says thank you for never even caring
I'll plan to see you all in hell
She sits there saying those stupid words over and over again
Thank you for destroying me

She's laying in his arms at quarter to three
Now her clothes are across the room and 
She's down on her knees
And she's thinking you're no better than her
And I'm no better than any of you
And she hears me say

She says thank you for never even caring
I'll plan to see you all in hell

Thank you for destroying me",Thank You
Lennon ,"She says, some nights I just lie awake
She says, sometimes I just sleep for days
Smokes another cigarette and looks around the room
What are these days coming to

She says, it seems I've been screwed over again
But that's okay who the hell needs friends
It's just easier to pretend
Say you don't care and watch for the end

One more night is all she thinks 
I won't come back, but I'm too weak

One more night, and than I'll leave

Silence uncovers the room
She looks to him in disarray
He says I'm not sorry and turns away

He says I'm tired of hearing you bitch
You're nothing more than a stupid trick
You're not even worth the price I paid 
Get out of my life, get out of my way

I won't come back, but I'm too weak
Those things he said to me, 
One more night, and than I'll leave

She's standing on the balcony saying look this is my destiny
One more step and I'll finally be free
He says if you want my help I'll give you that extra step

Used to swear there was nothing better than having me
For the night
When the morning came you'd quietly slip
Back into her life

[Chorus]
You can have your ways
I'm through living this lie
You can take those days
Let me move on, move on with my life

[Verse 2]
I used to watch you through the crowds as you ran your hands
Over her
Now these days are yours when morning comes it's I who
Slips out of his door

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
So many people say
I was just wasting my time
But that's all in the past
'Cause I've moved on with my life
Those days are gone
My day begins
You don't have my life
But I have this

Lennon ,"It's 6:30 in the morning and the neighbors walking his dog
I'm trying to wipe the sleep out of my eyes
I don't need your permission, the door's already open
So you call every day to see if I'm alright
How did you become the man who made a woman of this child
Ssh, I already have your excuses on hand

You look at me like you expect to see
Something there that use to be
Hello, goodbye I'm leaving you now
Oh, who's that there no that's not me
Don't come up and try to take me
I'm getting over our hello with my goodbye
I'm saying

It's 3:30 in the morning and I'm deciding to let this die
As I'm trying to take the pain out of my life
My orders were given and this case has been closed
So where are the calls to see if I'm alright
You are not a man but a devil in disguise
Hush, it's not worth listening anymore

You look at me like you expect to see
Something there that use to be

Lenny Breau,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Lenny Breau,"Once I had a secret love,
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love,
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Now, I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore.",Secret Love
Lenny Breau,"Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.
Where are the clowns?

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around,
one who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want 
sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer?
Losing my timing this late
in my career?
And where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.
Well, maybe next year",Send in the Clowns
Lenny Bruce,"When a man just can't be trusted
And again he's gone and lost it

Your call has been registered
It'll be returned when I get back home
I've been out loving all night long
I can't help it, that love it makes me strong

When a man just can't be trusted
And again he's gone and lost it

Ask me all the questions you need
I don't tell lies, my conscience don't bleed
You'll get all the time I can give
As long as you respect my freedom to live

When a man just can't be trusted
And again he's gone and lost it

I just can't be trusted

A kick in the ribs for the arrival late at night
So late in the evening you could see the morning light
When you're sat up alone and you wonder where I've been
You can pick up my belongings and tell me where I can take them

When a man just can't be trusted
And again he's gone and lost it

I just can't be trusted

Lenny Carlson,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues

Watching clouds drifting by

I never even make a gain
Believe me, I'm always chasing rainbows
Waiting to find a little bluebird in vain

Watching clouds drifting by
My schemes are just like all my dreams

Just leave all your things and come and celebrate life
This time is for love, not for heartache and strife
There's no time for games and there's no time to fight

The feeling so good and it's everywhere,
So come on along if you heart's feeling right,
Just open your wings it's a natural flight

And I'll see you in another life

He taught us of faith 'cause it's not about sight
He taught us of peace and unconditional love
He led us from wrong and forave us there of

He did all the things 'cause he wanted you
He died on that cross so you wouldn't have to,
And now all the worlds such a beautiful light,
Just open your eyes it's a beautiful sight

You can do what you want, you can say I'm a fool,
And I'll see you in another life
Another life, come on !

He told me that he loved
Me and that we're a family

He spoke about the world
And all the possibilities
Then he held me in his arms
And said be what you want to be

He paved the way for me to follow
Uncharted terrain now had a name
It's how I got over

When I became a man
My daddy said come walk with me
He said beeing a man
Comes with responsibility

And all is keep your word
To the best of your ability
Then he looked me in my eyes
And said it's time to set you free

He paved the way for me to follow
Uncharted terrain now had a name
It's how I got over

He paved the way for me to follow
Uncharted terrain now had a name
It's how I got over

He paved the way for me to follow
Uncharted terrain now had a name
It's how I got over",Uncharted Terrain
