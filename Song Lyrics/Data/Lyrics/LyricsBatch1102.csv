R. Kelly,"Welcome to the quiet before the storm
No worries, love
Oh yeah, ain't no pressure
Baby when I'm fuckin' you
The whole world can get tuned out
Like we've been smokin' on that loud
Cloud 9, we on
Both in the zone, yeah
Oh baby, sounds you make when I
Sounds so good, rewind them
Your man callin', decline him
I kill that pussy every time, bang bang
The thing I like about you
Is baby girl you're freaky too
'Til I hear the sirens
All I wanna do is hear that pussy screamin'

Let's make some noise
Let's make some noise
We'll be bangin' on the wall
'Til they hear it down the hall
'Til them sirens goin' off
We'll be makin' some noise
We'll be makin' some noise
And I love the noise we're makin'
So let's keep on doin' it, baby

Tell me how you feel inside, tell me
I like the way you fill inside
Can you keep it up all night?
I wanna keep this up all night
You know I am down to ride
'Cause I like the view from here
Say this pussy is the end all, be all
Riding that thing just like a seesaw all night
You know that I'm small, so baby, break me off
I know you just got off work
But now it's time to get me off
See the thing I like about you
Is baby, you are freaky too
So until we hear them sirens
I'ma be screaming your name

Let's make some noise
Let's make some noise
We'll be bangin' on the wall
'Til they hear it down the hall
'Til them sirens goin' off
We'll be makin' some noise
We'll be makin' some noise
And I love the noise we're makin'
So let's keep on doin' it, baby

Shhh I'm deep off in it, stammering
Got your legs shaking like a tambourine
And I'ma be doing it 'til the morning
When the morning come give you more dick
Feel it, can you take all these inches?
In it, you go from 0 to a hundred when I kiss it
And I know the neighbors gotta hate our guts
Cause we be making all kinds of noises when we fuck
See the thing I like about you
Is baby girl you're freaky too
So until I hear the sirens
All I wanna do is hear that pussy screamin'

Let's make some noise

And she be dancin' like a Majorette
Wetter than a river and I'm divin' in (splash)
Everyday a good day for sex
Four in the mornin' just like two in the evenin'
Take her into my world now ain't no way she leavin'
Give her just what she need
Take her smoke and a breather
Ass soft as a feather, I TKO it, Mayweather
In the lobby Four Seasons with like ten or twelve broads
All headed to my suite, it's a million thot march
Only thing we ain't about to do is sleep
Beat it like a drum, it sound like we at a Jamboree

R. Kelly,"Good evening ladies, shall we start with hors d'oeuvres?
I can tell your body's been lacking the plater of satisfaction your body deserves
We have reservations and I'm so glad that we're here
'Cause I'll be toasting your juices all night like cheers
See you need someone who understands you have a delicate pallet
Let me cater to you while indulging in my own bad eating habits
It's a celebration and you're the cream of the crop
Let me, and I promise I won't leave a drop
But wait, this is just the appetizer
By the time I reach dessert a climax couldn't get no higher
A leg couldn't shake no harder, we goin' at it so crazy
This love so tasty, I'm talkin' my jelly in your pastry
See baby I got every need, every want, every craving you seek
I'll be going deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper until lemons taste sweet

Got a big old yacht
Made of gold and cherry wood

And the moon and stars above
I would tell all of my friends it's just a phase

And happiness was all too much the same
Since the day that I found you
All of these things became true
Now dreams and all these things I can do
Merry Christmas, baby

Sorry I could not be there with you
But I pray everything is ok
I want you to know that I am missing you
And my heart is with you even though I'm far away
So tell me how's the dog, house, family and friends?
I want you to let em all know that I wish 'em well
And I promise I'll be coming home real soon
While I'm gone just keep checkin' your mail

Cause I'm sending a lifetime of kisses

Vowing that we will never part
Sending you that strength when times get tough
And just be on the look out for my trust
Cause I'm sending my love for Christmas

Out of the window the snow is coming down
And it all that makes me miss you more and more, more
So many memories of us all around the tree
And Grandpa would bring the presents through the door
And you and I, we done fool the kids to fall asleep
So that we can grab us drinks and toast to what we have
Though reading this letter is tough
Just know I really miss you much
So think of me when you're putting the lights up

Is a word closer to home
So I just want you to hold on

R. Stevie Moore,"I need love, love to ease my mind,
I need to find, find someone to call mine,
But mama said you can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take.
You can't hurry love,
No, you just have to wait,
You gotta trust, give it time,
No matter how long it takes;
But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again.
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on,
When I feel my strength, yeah, it's almost gone,
I remember mama said,

You can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take.
How long must I wait how much more can I take,
Before loneliness will 'cause my heart, heart to break?
No, I can't bear to live my life alone.
I grow impatient for a love to call my own,
But when I feel that I, I can't go on,
These precious words keeps me hanging on,
I remember mama said,

Can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
it's a game of give and take.

You can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take
No matter how long it takes.

No love, love don't come easy,
But I keep on waiting, anticipating for that
Soft voice to talk to me at night,
For some tender arms to hold me tight.
I keep waiting; I keep on waiting,
But it ain't easy, it ain't easy when mama said

You can't hurry love no,
You just have to wait,
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes.

Are you gonna cry, when I'm squeezin' the rye
Takin' all I can get, no regrets
When I, openly lie
And leave only money
Believe me honey, that money

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

R.E.D.K.,"J’ai la peau couleur pétrole donc tu connais ma richesse
Beaucoup trop loin sont mes Comores donc tu connais ma tristesse
Même si j’ai poussé loin de la terre de mes ancêtres
Dis-toi bien que mon archipel, c’est la racine de mon être
Yes, j’suis français et fier de l’être
Mais quand je reçois ces lettres, j’ai le tsunami sur mes pommettes
Dans ma tête, des images refont surface
Le visage de mon grand-père, les mariages au village
Sache que je n’peux oublier l’odeur du poisson grillé
Quand j’allais me promener avec ma mère sur le marché
Pour me réveiller, l’appel pour aller prier
Puis sur un champ on trouvait des cannes à sucre à mâcher
Comment éviter, toute cette pauvreté que leur humilité essaye sans cesse de cacher
Je te vois encore pleurer les douleurs du passé
Pour te soigner, écoute tes enfants chanter

Afrika, gravée dans ma peau et dans mon cœur à tout jamais (À tout jamais)
Afrika, malgré les apparences, t’es présent dans mes pensées (À tout jamais)
Afrika, Même en feux de détresse le monde ne t'as pas compris
Afrika, tes atouts sont tes faiblesses, tes richesses t’ont appauvri

J’ai le cœur et la tête remplis de souvenirs
Après chaque passage au bled, j’m’enrichis grâce à nos terres, j'me le dois de vous le dire
Tout n’est pas si facile ici, mais les gens sont cleans
J’en conclus que la vie n’est pas difficile, on s'la complique
Loin de tristesse et peur, et des visages renfrognés
J'cotoie la richesse des cœurs et les sourires de la pauvreté
Je vois des cicatrices, des plaies dans tous les domaines
J’comprends qu'mes petits caprices sont la solution à leurs problèmes
A l’abri dès mon retour, recommencent les vas-et-vients
Et la vie de tous les jours reprend ses droits en me volant les miens
J’accorde aux miens que des coups de fils les jours de fêtes
Et mes souvenirs les plus précieux sont tous punis dans un coin de ma tête
Comment t’expliquer, j'me sens là-bas comme ici
Pas de regard inférieur, je suis à l’extérieur comme à domicile
C’est ça l'époque fils, des fois la vie nous piège
Français ou Comorien, j'ai le coccyx entre deux sièges

Afrika, gravée dans ma peau et dans mon cœur à tout jamais (À tout jamais)
Afrika, malgré les apparences, t’es présent dans mes pensées (À tout jamais)
Afrika, Même en feux de détresse le monde ne t'as pas compris
Afrika, tes atouts sont tes faiblesses, tes richesses t’ont appauvri

Je suis l'résultat des sacrifices de mes parents
J’me dois de réussir pour que leurs larmes n’aient pas coulées pour rien
J'vis le rêve africain, et je me dois de l’honorer
Afrika est une reine et j'suis là pour la couronner
L’histoire ne t’as pas fait de cadeaux
Mais chacun de nos succès ramène ta fierté au plus haut

Et pour qu'on ait les rennes, ramener au bled nos pères et nos mères donc

Allez, allez oust!
En bas de nos couplets tu peux y voir un carré rouge
Vous êtes doux comme des agneaux, wesh les gars faites pas les oufs
On attire les critiques des titulaires du banc de touche
Quand on rappe ça fait mouche
Allez, allez, allez oust!

Rafale de rimes tu connais
J'suis loin de faire un rap édulcoré
J'te parle de peines de fermer les plaies mes frères sur l'île de Gorée
Oui c'est bien tout ça que cachent nos projets
Toi si tu pensais que pour moi c'était dead
Sache que c'est bête mon gars j'te répète que là tu t'es trompé

Au beau milieu de leur rap pourrave
J'entends chanter: ""Hip hip hip Hourra!""
A chaque fois que je rappe le courage de ces hommes qu'ont changé le monde
J'ai changé la donne avec ma diaspora
Loin de ces rappeurs qui rappent à la Dora
Qui me donnent l'impression de rapper qu'avec les couettes de Ingalls Laura

Le moral est beaucoup plus qu'opé
Mon rap ne fait que les choquer
C'est développé, les mots, les flows demande ils méritent beaucoup plus de trophées, Sopra'
J'arrive d-dopé, et toi?
J'suis venu défoncer toutes les portes à l'heure où toutes les choses se corsent
Et pas que sous l'île de Beauté
Si j'avais eu le pouvoir de Nakamura
Je serais parti revivre les freestyles de Ill, Booba, Lino, Le Rat
Ne vois tu pas arriver l'orage à chaque fois que j'lâche les molards
Sur la face des phases à rafales qui parlent à la masse donc dég-dég-dég-dégage

On tire on vise le sommet (Allez, allez oust)
Un flow qui fait décoller, pour tous les frères isolés
Un son pour vous épauler (Allez, allez allez!)

R.E.D.K.,"On voit beaucoup de conneries, j'pourrais vous en donner la preuve
Trop de choses horribles si bien que le voyant peut envier l'aveugle
Quand nous nous salissons c'est là qu'ça bug
En cas de trahison la mariée contrariée peut envier la veuve
J'ai vu la folie qu'un gars génère frero
Ici ça choque même plus qu'un quinquagénaire kiffe une Hello Kitty
Pour eux c'est trop limpide
J'attends le jour où la pédophilie sera une discipline aux Jeux Olympiques
J'ai vu des clichés car la paresse est active
Ils disent que pour fêter l'union chez nous les mariés se lapident
J'ai vu des couples se briser quand tout paraissait magique
Des mecs ivres et qui confondent la caresse et la gifle
J'ai vu d'la lâcheté chez ceux qu'on croit célèbre
Leur bassesse quand les élus nous rabaissent aucune de leur voix s'élève
J'ai vu un décor apocalyptique
Et des potos vendre leur âme au diable quand les enchères sont diaboliques

J'ai vu tellement de choses défiler dans son regard
Sourire et larme amour et haine là où les gens passent
Là où les hommes recherchent la paix avec les armes
Naissances, tueries, bravoure et peine et des meilleurs j'en passe
Même si c'est dans la douleur qu'on écrit son histoire
Ne vois-tu pas que le monde est fait de rire et de frayeur
Oui on y voit le pire et le meilleur

Va dire aux extraterrestres de ne pas se fier à nos cartes postales
Pour les accueillir y aura que des cris d'singes au stade
Révise l'histoire si t'as pas compris
Qu'ici trop regardent le monde avec l'œil de verre de Jean-Marie
J'ai vu l'anorexie, des complexes car ici
Trop regardent le monde avec l'œil d'un paparazzi
J'ai vu des jeunes prêts à tout pour réussir
Ici trop regardent le monde avec l'œil de Secret Story
J'ai vu des armes de l'Est dans des sacs d'écoliers
J'ai vu Superman voler mais qu'sur les pays pétroliers
J'ai vu en en Suède un mec jouer à GTA
J'ai vu le bling-bling de Nicolas nous coûter le triple A
J'ai vu le diable jouer ses gammes
J'ai vu Islam et terrorisme devenir un amalgame
J'ai vu des propos politiques avec une moustache hitlérienne
Le monde est conduit par des mecs au taux d'alcoolémie de Sue Ellen

J'ai vu de l'injustice à Guantanamo
Mais pas de nucléaire sous le sol irakien
J'ai vu des politiques qui souhaitent la mort à nos
Semblables et pas d'élus pour sauver les miens
J'ai vu des hypocrites qui nous mènent en bâteau
Et puis nous couler pour nous éloigner de la rive
A l'heure où tout le monde oublie les liens familiaux
Qu'il y a entre Isaac et Ismaïl

Mec loyal cherche pas d'similitude
J'plane comme un aigle royal pendant qu'les pies discutent
Avoue qu'c'est dingue et puis qu'c'est bien nous on progresse sans arrêt
Je vous préviens j'viens prendre un flow com-com-complètement barré
Quoi ? Le client est roi? C'est pas moi qui vais l'avaler
J'lui vole sa couronne et puis transforme ton auditeur en valet
Les rappeurs ont chopé le virus du manque de cash mais
Cette maladie se soigne qu'avec du liquide et un cachet
Après cette phase on m'dira qu'j'suis un moqueur né
Pourtant c'est cette même ordonnance qui a soigné les finances du Dr. Dre
J'me dois de le dire, je m'en tape de leur bla-blas j'ai vu pire
Je fais sauter tous les barrages, pas besoin de kalash, ni-même de famas
Mes tires sortent de ma bouche et parfois je fais pire
J'suis venu pour faire un carnage et puis fuir
Je n'ai pas besoin de bla-blas, ni même de leur passe-droit

Ne m'demande pas de me freiner, non poto ne me demande pas de changer
Quand je commence à rapper ou à chanter tu découvre la météo de mes pensées
Dansée, pleurée ou révoltée, ma musique a toujours été celle des opprimés
Je les vois jalouser ma liberté, derrière les barreaux de leurs street débilité
Ça fait des années que j'ai aiguisé ce style de fêlé
Ils sont fascinés, puis t'es déprimé face à mon CV
Rendez-vous après l'été, ce n'est pas près de s'arrêter
Bientôt le nouvel album de ma Psykatra! Ok
D'accord je reprends le débit sans limite mes gimmicks font crier
Les zéniths et l'Europe et l'Afrique et les blocs et publics par milliers
A l'heure où les ventes de disques sont pathé-thé-thétiques
Qu'on prend des-des risques avec mon équipe
Ça chante et ça kick, ça-ça ti-ti-tirs donc fuyez
Je les vois tous bâillonnés par les commentaires de Booska-P
Je les vois tous complexés par ces connes en pleine puberbté

Que j'rappe ou chante, le biz' perd les eaux
Je les entends parler de Soprano
Normal mon dernier album les traite d'tous les noms d'oiseaux

Je débarque, et déboule, me démarque des fous
Pas de doute et pas besoin de les pomper
Ils divaguent, sont tous dans le vague et le flou
Rien à foutre, je ne fais que dans le concret
Non je ne marche pas à tâtons, soyez pas cons
Mais bon partons, laissez tomber
J'rappe comme ça me chante, rappe comme ça me tente
Ce n'est vraiment pas la peine de me dompter

Poto je chantais bien avant l'époque de Da-Daddy K
Des styles différents comme les types du groupe de Ma-Manu Key
Ton Beats by Dre est plastiqué quand je commence à kicker
Entre deux styles j'suis à cheval, mais t'inquiète j'suis un bon jockey

T'inquiète j'suis dopé, j'évolue
Mais si le flow est méconnu
C'est pour choquer qu'on est venu

Pour donner le tournis à tous ces fous qui disait que Marseille avait coulé
J’viens leurs rouler dessus les rouer de coup de fouets et de flow de fou
Vas-y le couz’, à toi

Bienvenue là où les flow sont dévoilés sans arrêt
Déballés sans cesse on ramène des phrases complexes
On amène des phases qu’on n’peut comparer
Des fois même complètement barrées décalez-vous ça va faire boom
Allez couz’, à toi

Bienvenue là où les flows sortent d’Édouard Toulouse
Où les coups de blues et les coups de boules s’écoutent
Là où le fond et la forme roucoulent sur des prods lourdes
Où ça dégoute la concurrence qui veulent en découdre
À toi

Bienvenue dans notre labo loin des traitres et des collabos
Loin des mecs qui mènent en bateau pas de cadeaux

La bonne formule qui explose
Tous les micros, toutes les prods et tous les mythos, tous les faux
Avec des punch’ et des proses, aussi rapide que Busta, pour les mecs en Lacoste
Ou bien les beaux-gosses en costards
Oui c’est un simple constat
Les partisans de la paix reçoivent des bombes et les gosses cannent
Car pour baiser les pauvres, ils sont malades à la Strauss-Kahn
Prix Nobel de la haine et de la guerre qu’attisent de grosses flammes
Artistes dans le massacre ils mériteraient des oscars
On bosse tard et on s’bat, les obstacles
Mais n’ose pas aller là où l’innovation est devenue un obstacle
Un instant, je m'installe, mon instinct est bestial
Oui quand il s’agit de mettre du MC dans mon casse-dalle
Quand il s’agit de rapper, taffer, frapper sans compassion
Mais dans les règles de l’art tant que c’est fait avec passion
Pas de cadeau ni de vieux récit dans le labo, (Quoi?)

R.E.D.K.,"J'ai pas de p'tites coupures, ils me comprennent par crainte du Seigneur
Et vu la tournure que les choses prennent, je crains le pire, espère le meilleur
Une fois parti dans ma lancée, le mal me ronge
Quand j'suis plongé dans mes pensées, j'ai tendance à m'noyer dans mes songes
C'est ça le malheur
Y'a rien de comparable, les hommes n'ont plus de valeur
J'regrette celui qui valait cent carats
Ils se croient imparables
Puis s'imaginent qu'on n'y voit rien quand ils considèrent nos pays comme des boîtes à rats
C'est ça dans l'rap on parle on kiffe la rime
Pour l'oseille on se bouge mais les oreilles on s'bouche quand les estomacs crient famine
Je le dis et le pense
La beauté de nos paroles
N'a d'égale que la laideur de notre indifférence
Y'a pas de confusion pas même un peu d'ivresse
Je donne mon opinion, tire des conclusions du haut de ma petitesse
Motivé comme pas deux je manie vos verbes
Mes couplets vous font des baisers baveux avec la langue de Molière
Je mène mon combat jusqu'à l'épuisement
C'est la richesse de notre culture contre la pauvreté de leurs jugements
Si parce que je m'appelle Mohamed le statut de français je le mérite pas
Dites à François Hollande d'aller se présenter aux Pays-Bas
Avant tout sachez qu'à défaut de l'avoir à l'extérieur
Je la recherche à l'intérieur la paix
À l'heure où la violence prolifère
Je repense à Zied mort dans un braquage à cause d'une balle policière
Le chant des bastos nous berce écoute
La violence est une drogue dure dans les rues de Marseille beaucoup de nos frères se shootent
Si t'as pas le cran d'aller au bout fais pas le bourreau
Faudra assumer le fait de te faire fumer comme une Marlboro
Je m'interroge sur la cécité de la justice
Et me dit qu'elle est loin d'être aveugle
Elle ne voit que ce qu'elle veut voir c'est triste
Y'a trop d'anomalies
J'annonce la couleur et ta défaite comme ce jury raciste qui sourit à Bonaly
J'te jure c'est fou tout ça me sidère
Mate bien ce qui m'énerve plus que tout c'est qu'ils nous considèrent
Comme des moins que rien
Et toutes ces merdes m'énervent
J'aimerais que sur leurs canaux nos paroles aient du poids comme celles de Pierre Ménès
Tu connais je suis le mec le plus cool de la Terre
Homme de raison j'peux devenir le plus fou quand j'la perds
Je suis ce gars sans doute têtu qui n'adore pas la thune
Man pour l'instant ma bouche s'est tue parole à ma plume

Désolé pour le dérangement ce soir ma plume est ivre
Non pas de cellule de dégrisement ce soir ma plume est libre
Libre de dégueuler ses sentiments sur la place publique
À l'heure où la liberté est une expression zemmouristique
Noirs sont les désirs quand il s'agit de leur justice
Celle qui met chez nous le stress du clip de Justice
Pourquoi j'suis si triste
Comment ne pas l'être quand je vois que les hommes cherchent le Paradis sous les pieds de Iblis
Cherchent l'armistice
Intérieur auprès d'une femme qui n'a pas les neurones d'Afida Turner
Ouais comme Will Smith
J'suis à la recherche du bonheur pour enfin prendre de la hauteur
Ou pire, atterrir comme Taïg Khris
Mec en temps de crise faut faire des sous
L'Afrique crie famine
La crise a fait qu'on est encore plus sourd
Ça crie au secours car le pouvoir d'achat baisse
L'Euro c'est le régime minceur de l'Europe voilà pourquoi on n'a plus de Grèce
Je presse la détente de ma plume à chaque fois que je stresse
Ou quand la Une entoure la vérité d'un peu de brume
Oui j'ai mis dans l'urne un bulletin SOS anti Jean-Marie
Ils ont mis l'Afrique en cloque et se prennent pour Cheb Mami
Non ne pleure pas Mamie je suis là pour vous honorer
Les darons étaient des kings
Les colons des Conrad Murray
Et j'ai juré que ma plume n'aurait jamais d'Alzheimer
Si la vérité est une mode j'suis son designer

Rien à foutre de ton rap jeu
Faut du liquide, liquide chez moi pour pouvoir éteindre le feu
Ouais ouais poto j'ai grillé tous les feux
Que les puristes ont mis sur ma route
Je conduis une ambulance alors vos codes rien à foutre
En plus, ici ça joue les Pablo
Ils portent tous une chemise hawaïenne
Pas comme Tony mais comme Gbagbo
Ras le bol de ces clichés qu'on a sur le dos
Déjà qu'ici on a les mains sales même avec lodo
Marre de voir nos darons investir dans le Loto
Pourquoi ça coupe?
On est à l'époque du serato
Merde, je crois que ma plume a bu un coup d'trop

Du fond d'ma crique, putain d'nègre, j'passe le bonsoir
Derrière ma plume, niggas, j'ai planqué la foudre
J'voulais parler d'amour mais dans nos rues y'a comme une odeur d'poudre
Une corde, une poutre, un pendu sur la place publique
Spectaculaire époque ou même la mort génère un public
Pétasse peu pudique, au nom de la femme libre
Putain d'théories d'merde gravées dans leurs livres

S'en sortir c'est possible, sans sport et gros single
Dix piges, ça pense à l'argent aussi jeune ?
Résultat on a plus de péchés que dans Seven
On s’entre-tue à cause de frontières imposées
Et Place Vendôme, ils exhibent nos diamants en guise de trophées
Nous voir ça les rend malades
Ils ont dû attraper cette rage avec la viande hallal

J'viens en temps d'guerre, parce que la paix s'trouve six pieds sous terre
Oublie la trêve j'me trimbale avec une pelle, j'enterre mes rêves
Vu les risques j'vise l'essentiel
La chance s'fait rare y'a plus un rond au pied de l'arc-en-ciel
Ici les blessures saignent, quand les temps sont sales
Les temps sont barges, on nous parle de plan social
C'est grave comme si c'était si simple, on récolte ce que l'on sème
Plaide coupable et victime du système

Et si on fait les choses, qu'on a une cause

D'ici j'les entends parler tout bas, trop de méfiance et de coups-bas
De propos vides de sens, mon innocence ne peut être coupable
J'me méfie des traîtres, une personne qui manque de confiance en soi
Par définition pourrait être la pire des traitres
J'suis venu rapper tout haut car mon phrasé est pur
Ceux qui parlent dans leur barbe ne sont juste bons qu'à raser les murs
Averse de sincérité sur le sillon
J'arrive et crache mes vérités le rap s'abreuve de mes postillons

I saw you buried in the sand

Said, walk on by

So, I went walking through the street
I saw you strung up in a tree

Said, hold your tongue, ma, hold your tongue

R.E.M.,"Reverend Bill Funderburk sings ""He Cared That Much For Me""
Charles Surratt introduces his own composition ""On Calvary For Me""
""The Joy of Knowing Jesus"" is a song of pure delight featuring John Barbee

The pure tenor quality of the voice of Harold Montgomery
Gives a special interpretation to the grand old hymn ""The Old Rugged Cross""
Chill bumps appear and I am frozen in the web they weave as they reveal their
Innermost selves with the outpouring of their hearts
On and on the songs roll and soon you are caught up
In the sermon in each rendition as you come to feel
The devotion and dedication that is poured forth
Suddenly, you know they are real, they mean it!

""Let your light so shine""
Could not be more aptly applied
As there shines a light from heaven on your heart
Through their singing. As an artist, Rhonda Montgomery
Exemplifies piano artistry. That's Rhonda! An artist!

This album can be the instrument to mend a broken heart
Or to straighten out your life through the sincere testimony
In the songs of The Revelaires. A must!

Turned around backwards so the windshield shows
Every streetlight reveals the picture in reverse
Still, it's so much clearer
I forgot my shirt at the water's edge
The moon is low tonight
Nightswimming deserves a quiet night

It's not like years ago

Of recklessness and water
They cannot see me naked
These things, they go away
Replaced by everyday

September's coming soon
I'm pining for the moon
And what if there were two
Side by side in orbit
Around the fairest sun?

I can see you there with luna moths
And watermelon gum

With nowhere else to run

R.E.M.,"""As I raise my head to broadcast my objection
As your latest triumph draws the final straw 
Who died and lifted you up to perfection?
And what silenced me is written into law.

And I turn my head away
If I look I'm not sure that I could face you.
Not again, not today, not today.

If hatred makes a play on me tomorrow
And forgiveness takes a back seat to revenge
There's a hurt down deep that has not been corrected
There's a voice in me that says you will not win.

And if I ignore the voice inside,
Raise a half glass to my home.
But it's there that I am most afraid,
And forgetting doesn't hold.

It doesn't hold.

That two wrongs make a right.

Forgiveness is the only hope I hold.
And love, love will be my strongest weapon.
I do believe that I am not alone.

For this fear will not destroy me.

It's knowing now where I am weakest
And the voice in my head.

I look at her and I see the beauty (say, say, the light)
Of the light of music
The voices talking somewhere in the house
Late spring and you're drifting off to sleep
With your teeth in your mouth
You are here with me
You are here with me
You have been here and you are everything

Sometimes I feel like I can't even sing (say, say, the light)
I'm very scared for this world
I'm very scared for me (say, say, the light)
Eviscerate your memory
Here's a scene
You're in the back seat laying down (say, say, the light)
The windows wrap around
To sound of the travel and the engine (say, say, the light)
All you hear is time stand still in travel
And feel such peace and absolute
The stillness still that doesn't end
But slowly drifts into sleep
The greatest thing you've ever seen
And they're there for you
For you alone you are the everything
For you alone you are the everything",You Are the Everything

R.E.M.,"Sinking fast, the weight chained to my feet
No time to argue with belief
I'm not alone, a thousand others dropping
Faster than me
What put me here?
Nothing to hold on to
Nowhere to brake

[Chorus]
Where is the ripcord, the trapdoor, the key?
Where is the cartoon escape-hatch for me?
No time to question the choices I make
I've got to follow another direction (although fall down is much cooler)

The last thing I remember was climbing up the stairs
I threw the window open in challenge and despair
I don't know what I needed
I needed time
I needed to escape
I saw the future turn
Upside-down and hesitate.

[Chorus]

Uncertainty is suffocating

Corner me
And make me something

I'm a phantom-weight with a mouth full of feathers,
Don't you know that what comes around goes around?

I'm not that easy,
I am not your horse to water.
I hold my breath I come around, round, round.

You're mixing up living in chin-chin,
You're mixing up lose with win-win,
You lead a horse to water and you watch him drown.

Pump me up a beanstalk fable

I was taught to hold my head high
Collect what is mine,

We lost Davy in the Korean war.
I still don't know what for, don't matter any more.

You know that old trees just grow stronger,
and old rivers grow wilder every day,
but old people, they just grow lonesome
waiting for someone to say,
""Hello in there. Hello""

Me and my husband, we don't talk much anymore.
He sits and stares through the backdoor screen.
And all the news just repeats itself
like some forgotten dream
that we've both seen.

Someday I'll go and call up Judy.
We worked together at the factory.
Ah, but what would I say when she asks what's new?
Say, ""Nothing, what's with you?
Nothing much to do.""

You know that old trees just grow stronger,
and old rivers grow wilder every day,
ah, but, but old people, they just grow lonesome
waiting for someone to say,

Caiu o santo do pau oco
Foge pro riacho
Foge que eu te acho assim

Não agüentou fila de espera

I'll be right here, so woman call me
And I'll never ever let you down.

To bring your woman back home after she's left you for another,

Sittin' without any company at all

As I take you in my arms and hold you close 
Though I don't understand a word you're saying 
Your brown eyes tell me all I need to know

Hearts are still the same when night begins to fall 
Sure as there are stars above we're not the first to fall in love

I don't want to be the only one

Will you allow us to be who we're supposed to be
Or will time erode our thoughts, our will, insanity

Free from our wounds and from our sin
Islands of lust turn around and bring your feet to the ground

Endless, a soul that's misunderstood
Soldiers in time will fall down from the highest wall

And everything I see remembers who you were
The day that you were gone from me
And I can't find the words to say
Shouldn't it be easier than this
So much easier than this for me

I carry a broken chain
Poisoned and fighting for myself
Simple and mesmerized, my anger is exercised
Slowly my heart has turned to cold

And starts a fire there and then I lose control

Como eu vou mentir, como eu vou pecar

As he wades through the village
Towards the center of town

I see Heaven everywhere I go.
Thank-You for my brand new life! Yeah

I never realized what it meant to be free;
Now I see, all I need
Is what You want for me.

And I believe it, you've erased any doubt
I know it now, can't live without
All you've given me, yeah.

I would climb up an endless mountain for Your love
I would crawl across the mighty desert for Your love

You set the world in motion
You made the stars and oceans
And everything that breathes, Yeah

You cause the sky to thunder
You fill the world with wonder
And that amazes me
That you would plan all my days eternally
Long before I was born you dreamt of me
If it weren't for your company
Then where would I be

No one else can know me
No one else could hold me
The way you do
You fill my life with passion
And I cannot imagine a world without you

Can you feel my devotion and my love
If I could spend everyday with you
It wouldn't be enough

It's taken me all these roads to learn how to run
After the rain has washed away the stuff I thought I knew

I've been sweeping around this room with a fine tooth broom
Still don't have a clue
I've been searching for signs of life
But nothing's coming through

A wealth of tiny truths
Tripping over the same old things I thought I'd long since moved

The fail-safe ?love thy neighbor plan?
The promise, the creed, the other cheek, so help me

The path has been cleared
I've been a little hesitant
But you still find me here
You've been flooding my thoughts, now I'm breaking the locks
Making my way through
I can see to the other side, I'm so glad it's you

I believe in the one about reaching out, living loud, and all my doubts
I believe in what I can't do and I believe, I believe in you

Don't care where we go, let's make it last
Facing up to the speed of light, with time at our backs
I'm right here next to you and feeling so fearless now
We can do anything, nothing can hold us down
You rescued me from the weight of the world and I want you to know
You are my one and only
You're not like the rest, I know that you've got my back
You are, you are
You are my one and only
Right from the start, you saved my damaged heart

You are, you are, you are my one and only, only, only
Every time that I see you smile
It's like all of the universe is dancing in your eyes
A new star is born, so let's make a wish
Let's put on a show tonight and light up the sky
My love will last forever, that's right, I said forever
It's all because you made my heart believe
It's something powerful, so indestructible
It will live for eternity",My One and Only

But everything’s spinning out of control! 
I know, I know to stay alive it gets so crazy day and night
But I got somebody by my side, by my side!

Every time I cry, and I wanna hide,
Feeling like I’m damaged on the inside,
You know just what to do!

Rachael Price,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You
Rachael Price,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue
Rachael Price,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Rachael Price,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in

In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in

Rachael Price,"""Clang, clang, clang"" went the trolley
""Ding, ding, ding"" went the bell
""Zing, zing, zing"" went my heartstrings
For the moment I saw him I fell
 
""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine
All the way to the end of the line",The Trolley Song
Rachael Price,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head

Oh, we're gonna get in trouble and he's on our trail.

Don't fit anywhere into my life, but that's okay

And everyone says I'm a fool
Would you meet me by the water tonight?
'Cause I'm ready to break all the rules

Please don't leave me standing with my heart in my hand
I can't last here
I'm breaking down, and no one understands why I got here

You'd be the one

Would you meet me by the water tonight?
Would you please fall asleep holding my hand?

Rachael Yamagata,"I was walking into the psychiatrists office when I met him
He was sitting there, looking cute
He had schitzophrenea 
He was rich, he became my best friend
My boyfriend wasn't happy that I always hung out with him 
Cause he became obsessed with me
He pretended to take a lot of pills to scare me 
So I went to his penthouse in his hotel and stayed with him 
Despite my boyfriends objections
He held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me if I left him there
I put him in a mentally crazy hospital and my boyfriend left me

You got your ticket too soon

'Cause everybody's getting ruined
They are waiting to see what you do
Too long, waiting 

Everybody's cleared the room
And they'll dress you up
Stand you in all the right places 
Words like honey
Smile as they change your faces
With no regard to you at all
And you find they treat you like a paper doll

And they'll dress you up for the flight
Like Ophelia, you wave goodnight
With the earth and sky you cheer and cry
Writhe as all your days go by
And laugh as you die

Rachael Yamagata,"I think he's in a jealous rage
She's probably not the easiest one to live with either
There's nothing worse than bitterness
Just splashed across the page
I don't think that either one of them are fit to be alive
Oh, She'd just shut up and do what she does best
Show a little bit of skin
But keep it all when she's undressed
And doesn't she know that she is doing it all wrong
You can't tell a joke, yeah
While I'm listening to your song

All of this talking and all of this chatter
Is making me sick
Even though they say it doesn't matter

Let's put them in a room
Or maybe they should stay apart
Or maybe words are meant a mile
Yeah, let's fuck with their hearts

There's no reason to change
So lets watch everybody bleed
Cause everybody loves an accident
And everybody loves what they read

I think he's gonna be a big star
A voice of social change to rearrange the worlds perspective
But there's nothing better than watching him go down
He could pick up a habit or get in trouble
That might be affective

Oh, If he'd just shut off his conscience for one day
And take a cue from all of us
And give us a song we can really play
Doesn't he know he's going down
And going down fast
If he keeps on being difficult
He'll always come in last

[Chorus]

Lets take away the stars
Give while enough a add-on
He's calling for backup
But, I'm strong enough to take that phone

There's reason to change
So lets go all have a beer
Cause everybody loves an accident
And everybody loves what they hear

Two sides working together
And working against one another
Two bad souls are destroyed
It's the nature of business
You know how this part is

Oh look, they're losing all of their trust
Oh look, they're trying to bite the helping hand that feeds them
We put clothes on their backs
And they try to take the money up front
Now they don't like what we're saying
So lets up and leave them

We would have done what they are doing anyway
So this shit about taking in the souls
And life's lasting misery
We're gonna take them down
And do it on the front page
Watch those little crooks come crawling back on bended knee

[Chorus]

I'm becoming a bore
Now I am wasting ashore
Now I'm still broken
But the subjects been spoken

There's no reason to change
But it sure is fun to advertise a fight
We're feeding off each other once again
But now neither one of us will give an inch until I break

Will I save you from the rest?

Save a little something for me too

Full moon is there wisdom in your tide play?
The cold is come and now the love throwing everybody off
Sleep just doesn't taste the same

Rachael Yamagata,"If the elephants have past lives, yet are destined to always remember,
It's no wonder how they scream,
Like you and I, they must have some temper.
And I am dreaming of them on the plains, dirtying up their beds,
Watching for some kind of rain to cool their hot heads.
And how dare that you send me that card when I'm doing all that I can do.
You are forcing me to remember when all I want is to just forget you.
If the tiger shall protect her young, then tell me how did you slip by.
All my instincts have failed me for once, I must have somehow slept the whole night.

And I am dreaming of them with their kill, tearing it all apart,
Blood dripping from their lips, and teeth sinking in too hearts.
And how dare that you say you will call, when you know I need some peace of mind..
If you had to take sides with the animals, won't you do it with one who is kind?

If the hawks in the trees need the dead, if you're living you don't stand a chance.
You can lie there and say you are fed, but there are only two ends to this dance.
You can flee with your wounds just in time, or lie there as he feeds,
Watching yourself ripped to shreds and laughing as you bleed.

So for those of you falling in love, keep it kind, keep it good, keep it right.
Throw yourself in the midst of danger, but keep one eye open at night.",Elephants

I've been looking around, up and down
Nowhere there
Someday I hope to find the horizon

The last time I held you, it was head to heart
The curtain was drawing
I left you sleeping so sound

After we would stay apart
I would have whispered
All the things I can't tell you now

I don't believe in you
Like I so wanted to
I hope you're asking the heavens above
To forgive all the damage you've done
And if I didn't teach you anything at all
I hope that you learned how to love
But I doubt if I ever talk to you , I don't know

Oh, I couldn't see the moon tonight
Not one wave
Not one wave was out for you
No, I couldn't see the pale moonlight
Not one part
Not one wave was coming through
And I'm terrified to look outside
'Cause I need you

Starlight makes it all the same
No light and I feel the pain
Starlight makes it all a game with you, baby
Starlight and I feel the same
Missed flight on this airplane
I'd jump from a moving train
Just to keep you, would you do it for me?

Oh, I couldn't see the sky tonight
Not one star, not one star has shone for you
Yeah, I had a real hard time tonight
I still feel your breath
Oh my love I hold for you
And I think that I've been holding out
To hold onto
And I'm terrified to look outside
'Cause I need you

Something about you is like
Drinking a cold glass of water
Everyone needs a place to go to sometimes
Something about you is like
Going against Mother Nature
And I decide to face her every time

Starlight makes it all the same
No light and I feel the pain
Starlight makes it all a game with you, baby
Starlight and I feel the same
Missed flight on this airplane
I'd jump from a moving train
Just to keep you, would you do it for me?

As I watch you walk across the street
I keep wondering why I can't leave
All the heavens are against me and you
Do you even know a thing 'bout me?
Do you even think about my needs?

For I haven't seen a smile
Quite as lovely as yours for awhile
Stick around, I'll be good to you

When I get my arms around you, boy, I won't let go
When you find a spark to awaken your precious heart
You stick around and you'll see it through

I've been in trouble before with my pressured ember
I'm willing to take that chance again
And if we get caught in some crazy wind
We can just get swept away, what do you say?

Baby, make up your mind, 'cause you know I don't wanna waste time

Rachael Yamagata,"My friends become my foes
And my foes become my friends
I tend to fall in love with the girls
My boyfriend ends

I don't work 9 to 5
But I'll always work the weekends
And each time I'll get the world
In my fingers something happens

I'm working backwards, forwards
And left to right
And I'm pretty darn hard headed
But I can't make up my mind

I'll take a tragedy over a fairytale
But only when the sun is shining
I'll be the voice of hope in your darkest hour
I'm an expert in the silver lining

I'll be there when you need me
For all the big things
But I'm really pathetic at perfect timing
And that's the way it seems to go for me

I go to bed at 8 and wake up at 4.30
Most day I drink like a fish and tend to be too flirty
I am a perfectionist but only when things get dirty
I cannot stand small talk but I'm great at being wordy

And I'd rather leave you first
But then I'll be begging you to come back
And when I get real quiet
You know I'm about to attack

I'll take a walk in the rain or a drive in the dark
But only when everyone's celebrating
I'll dig in to your pain and tear it apart
But only to help the heart that's breaking

I like to figure things out and make everything right
But I'm secretly thrilled when everything's changing
And that's the way it seems to go for me

If you fall for the part that's brooding and dark
You will never discover the rest of my heart
And I want you to see that there's so much to see
Just before I declare you never knew me

He's with the small stuff like the world around was over
I calm him down and we make breakfast for each other
Our friends all thought we fit so perfectly together
He likes what he can't have and I sure like bad weather

I may have left him first
But I think he'd been leaving for sometime
I feel like begging him to come back
But I can't make up my mind

I'll take a boxing match over the quiet night
But only to make for better dreams
I'll back the underdog in any fight
But only to fight for something worth keeping

I'm in it to win it, most of the time
And if it goes down I'll be kicking and screaming
And that's the way it seems to go for me
Yeah, and that's the way it seems to go for me
Whoa, and that's the way it seems to go for me",The Way It Seems to Go
Rachael Yamagata,"If you would only let me,
I could show you how to love
Take our time, let all it go
If you'd would only let me
I could show you how to cry
In your darkest hour
I would lead you through the fire

But you won't let me

I just want to give it one more try
And I'd do anything

If you'd only let me

I would show you how to laugh

It's time to be kind to one and all.

Would be so happy if you would bring

Everywhere there's an air of Christmas joy.

And you'd like to find a way to show the things that words can't say.

Why don't you give love on Christmas Day

All need to know there's someone who cares.

And the only thing that kept me sane

Drowning all my sorrows
In an effort to be free

Or hoping that my cigarette smoke
Would carry it away

Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

Rachel Lauren,"War, war, war, war, war, war, war
On a silent shore
I spoke to god
The sun is down
Assemble the great pandemonium
War

One more down by the brook of Babylon
One more down in accordance with my fate
One long drift across the lake of Avalon
One more trip that I must create

And my eyes sweep a shore
That was always there
A blood red line
Through the sonisphere
I can't resolve where it's coming from
I sense it's the great pandemonium

One more, just one more
Just one, just one more day
One more day by the pits of hell
Just one more when even yesterday was too late
One more thought that I have to sow
One last trick that you can't debate

War

On a silent shore
I confronted fear
I spoke to god
But he wasn't there
The sun is down
And the war begun
Assemble the great pandemonium

Growls
Break down
Got to break down
Break down

And my eyes sweep a shore
That was always there
A blood red line
Through the sonisphere
I can't resolve where it's coming from
I sense it's the great pandemonium

On a silent shore
I confronted fear
I spoke to god
But he wasn't there
The sun is down
And the war begun
Assemble the great pandemonium

Just one, just one, just one more day

Rachel Macfarlane,"Slow down, you move too fast
You got to make the morning last
Just kicking down the cobble stones
Looking for fun and feelin' groovy

Hello lamppost, what cha knowing?
I've come to watch your flowers growing
Ain't cha got no rhymes for me?
Doot-in' doo-doo
Feelin' groovy

Got no deeds to do
No promises to keep
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
Let the morning time drop all its petals on me
Life, I love you
All is groovy

Rachel Macfarlane,"Loneliness
Takes the romance out of falling stars
Fills the wishing wells and fills the bars
Run and hide the scars of loneliness

Loneliness
Makes the winter's night seem twice as long
Makes the summer sunlight much too strong
Nothing's really wrong
It's only loneliness

So stay awhile
We both have stories that are hungry to be told
Your eyes are warm but I can feel your hands are cold
Still they're nice to hold
It only takes a simple yes
The time we spend leaves that much less for
Loneliness
Like a love song or an old cliche
Has it's hideouts but it's never far away
Look around you've found
It's only loneliness

So stay awhile
We've worn the night away and now it's almost done
If you could stay a bit of breakfast might be fun
It's too much work for one
And though it's just a simple guess
We're stronger now we've made the best of
Loneliness
Waits in silence while the shadows grow
Waits and wonders if it's finally time to go
The yes in our hello said no to
Loneliness

Rachel Macfarlane,"Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee

A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous, he answers twice
It's really killin' that he's so willin'
To make whoopee

Now, picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring

He's washin' dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious, he even sews
But don't forget folks, 
That's what you get folks
For makin' whoopee

Another year, or maybe less
What's this I hear? 
Well can't you guess?
She feels neglected, and he's suspected
Of makin' whoopee

She sits alone most every night
He doesn't phone her, he doesn't write
He says he's busy, but she says, is he?
He's makin' whoopee

Well he doesn't make much money
Only five thousand per
And some judge that thinks he's funny
Says, you'll pay six to her

So he says, judge, suppose I fail?
The judge says, march right into jail
You better keep her, I think it's cheaper
Than makin' whoopee

Is to save every day till eternity passes away

I'd save every day like a treasure and then
Again, I would spend them with you

And dreams that had never come true

And people are just too much for me to face
I climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space

On the roof it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below won't bother me
So when I come home feeling tired and beat
I'll go up where the air is fresh and sweet

I'll get far away from the hustlin' crowd
And all that rat race noise down in the street
On the roof that's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Up on the roof

At night the stars put on a show for free
And darlin' you can share it all with me

I keep telling you
Right smack dab in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's trouble proof
And if this world starts gettin' you down
There's room enough for two up on the roof

Rachel Pearl,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Colosseum,
You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,
You're Mickey Mouse.
You're the Nile, You're the Tow'r of Pisa,
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa.
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

Your words poetic are not pathetic
On the other hand, boy, you shine
And I can feel after every line
A thrill divine down my spine.
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans
Might think that your song is bad,
But for a person who's just rehearsin'
Well I gotta say this my lad:

You're the top! You're Mahatma Ghandi.
You're the top! You're Napolean brandy.
You're the purple light of a summer night in Spain,
You're the National Gall'ry, You're Garbo's sal'ry,
You're cellophane.
You're sublime, You're a turkey dinner.
You're the time of the Derby winner.
I'm a toy balloon that is fated soon to pop.
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top! You're a Ritz hot toddy.
You're the top! You're a Brewster body.
You're the boats that glide on the sleepy Zuider Zee,
You're a Nathan Panning, You're Bishop Manning,
You're broccoli.
You're a prize, You're a night at Coney,
You're the eyes of Irene Bordoni,
I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top.

You're the top! You're an Arrow collar.
You're the top! You're a Coolidge dollar.
You're the nimble tread of the feet of Fred Astaire,
You're an O'Neill drama, You're Whistler's mama,
You're Camembert.
You're a rose, You're Inferno's Dante,
You're the nost of the great Durante.
I'm just in the way, as the French would say
""De trop,""
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top.

You're the top! You're a Waldorf salad.
You're the top! You're a Berlin ballad.
You're a baby grand of a lady and a gent.
You're an old dutch master, You're Mrs. Aster,
You're Pepsodent.
You're romance, You're the steppes of Russia,
You're the pants on a Roxy usher.
I'm a lazy lout that's just about to stop,

You're Ovaltine.
You're a boon, You're the dam at Boulder,

I'm a nominee of the G.O.P. or GOP,

You're the top! You're the Tower of Babel.
You're the top! You're the Whitney Stable.
By the River Rhine, You're a sturdy stein of beer,
You're a dress from Saks's, You're next year's taxes,'
You're stratosphere.
You're my thoist, You're a Drumstick Lipstick,

Tell us a story of what we once knew
Paint us a picture of some great excuse
Cause we lost the truth, when we stopped the music

We are everything we own, right?
And the second that we don't fight
Is the moment that we own life
Keep it up, keep it up, oh

We don't care what time it is
No one here is fightin' this
If the DJ keeps on finding hits
We could keep this going for days
We don't care what time it is
No one here is fightin' this
If the DJ keeps on finding hits
We could keep this going for days

With our feet in the sand and sea in our hands we don't stop
We remember to drink in everything and it's easy when the beat drops
We pulse and we sway and keep morning away from here
Cause nothing exists but love on our lips and beat on our hips
The only real moment is this

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh, love what we got because love is a lot
Life fools us into thinking that we're broke but we're not
Bring your body in to the beach again
Recognize the moment that you're free again

You are everything we own,
And the second that you don't fight
Is the moment that you own life
Keep it up, keep it up, oh

Cause nothing exists but love on our lips and beat on our hips

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

So they lead you to the beach again
Heat is getting to your head you think
Someone pulls you in and the lights are dim
But you recognize the rhythm crawling through your skin and

You are everything you own, right?
So the second that you don't fight
Is the moment that you own life
Keep it up, keep it up, oh

We don't care what time it is
No one here is fightin' this

So in her head she leaves again
And they've painted ceilings blue and green
And brilliant colors she's never seen

And nothing ever happens if you stay in your room
Nothing ever happens if you leave the party too soon
You'll never be a winner if you're not in the game
Nothing ever happens if you always play it safe

But gathers dust upon itself

Maybe soon she'll feel that way

Nothing ever happens if you leave the party too soon
Nothing ever happens if you don't get hurt
Nothing ever happens if you never get dirty

So we hide away our hurts
And put bandaids on our fears
And we lie to all our friends

And the violins appear
And a simple little melody has us fighting tears

Came from my daddy's pocketknife, 
That wasn't my fault
Moved along with us everywhere we went,
No matter where we lived it always fit in,
Kinda like our next of kin, 
If that chair could talk
My little brother, Billy, broke his left hand
Jumpin' off the arm like superman
With my grandma's old red afghan tied around his neck
It's where at least a thousand books were read,
Our Siamese cat made her bed
It ever heard ""And I thee wed""
When sister married in the living room
To that Phillips boy from just down the block
If that chair could talk
Mama bought it in a yard sale in '65
It was daddy's favorite chair after he retired
Survived all of that and a kitched fire,
Smoke stains wiped right off
It's where I spent a million hours talking on the phone 
It was my favorite place to polish my toes
Something Mama didn't know, 
If that chair could talk
From Leave it to Beaver to the Brady Bunch
Chicken Noodle Soup and Captain Crunch
TV Dinners to Sunday lunch, and movies late at night
Brother tippin' me backwards until I screamed
He'd get in trouble for bein' so mean
And when he told Mama that he'd joined the Marines
It's where she sat down in shock
The good, the bad, it's seen it all
If that chair could talk
It caught my tears,
Head me up when I felt bad,
It called my fears, 
It's good to keep a friend like that.
It hid the ice cream money for hot summer days,
Listened while I practed for my high school play,
And all the times it heard me pray,
When things were going rough.
And it's where Bobby Baker gave me my first kiss,
Mama came in and nearly had a fit,
There's footprints of my life all over it,
We've been through a lot. 
The good, the bad, it's seen it all,
If that chair could talk.

Turnin' off the ringer, closin' up all the blinds

An' empty coke bottles an' coffee cups. 
Drivin' through the rain with no radio, 
Tryin' not to wake her up. 
Cell 'phone says ""low battery"", 
God, what if I break down? 
I'm just lookin' for an exit with a lotta lights, 
A safe little interstate town. 

Just a cheap hotel, 
With a single bed, 
And cable TV 
Is good enough for me an' Emily. 

Some day, when she's old enough, 
She's gonna start askin' questions about him. 
Some kid at school brings his Dad for show an' tell, 
An' gets her little mind a-wonderin' 
""Where's my Daddy? Do I have one? 
""Does he not love me like you do?"" 
Oh, maybe I'll find someone to love the both of us, 
An' I'll tell her when she's old enough to know the truth. 

Will it break her heart? 
Will she understand, 
That I had to leave? 
That's what was best for me an' Emily. 

That house was never clean enough
his dinner never warm enough. 
Nothing I did was ever good enough to make him happy. 
So, I guess, he gave me what he thought I deserved, 
But it would kill me if he ever raised his hand to her. 

Big rigs are throwin' rain on my windshield, 
An' I feel like they're laughin' at me. 
Fin'lly the storm is lettin' up, 
An' the mornin' is breakin' free. 

It's a brand new day, 
It's a second chance. 
Yesterday is just a memory, 
For me an' Emily.

And a pretty wife, a bed to match his sheets

Rachel Proctor,"
There's two trees in Becky Hill's front yard,
One big, and one small
That big oak's been there for ages
And they planted that willow last fall

He bought it for their anniversary,
So they could watch it grow like their love
Well each day she looks out the window,
To see it not growing that much.

And she cries like that weeping willow,
Every time the wind starts to blow
One of these days she's gonna be strong,
Strong like the oak.

Now she hates the thought of leaving,
She hates to stay,
But somewhere in her heart she still needs him,
But not as much as she did yesterday.

And she cries like that weeping willow,
Every time the wind starts to blow
One of these days she's gonna be strong,
Strong like the oak.

She'll walk out that screen door and hold her hand high,
Won't look back, won't shed a tear
Right now she's afraid of being alone,
Oh, but she's been alone for years

She cries like that weeping willow,
Every time the wind starts to blow
One of these days, she's gonna be strong,
Strong like the oak.

Yeah one of these days, she's gonna be strong,
Strong as an oak

Rachel Proctor,"We were way too young a couple of crazy kids
They said it was a fairy-tale land we were livin' in
And lookin' back you know we were pretty green
Aren't you glad we were smart enough to be that naive
Steppin' out on the limb
Just think if we had listened to them

We'd never danced under the stars in Colorado
Or took that drive across the Rio Grande
We'd never laid eyes on that California sunset
Or dipped our toes in that Monterey Sand
There'd be no yesterday and baby we couldn't say
HEY, HEY We did it our way
HEY, HEY We did it our way
Everybody Tried to tell us where to plant our seeds
They just couldn't understand why we had to spread our wings
All we needed to pass life's little test
Was a second-hand car and a place to lay our heads
I thank God for you
Baby, I know our aim was true

[Chorus]
We'd never walked the streets of Albuquerque
Or took that trip anywhere bound
Must've been fate forgettin' that road map
We got lost and found this little town
What a perfect place and we can sit back and say

And I've spent too many endless nights alone
Wondering if I was broken and why everything felt so wrong
And where do I belong
I see beyond the end of time when I look into your eyes
It's so much bigger than this life and everything's right
I feel so safe, safe as a child in your arms
This is where I belong
I've seen my share of troubles
And tears I've shed in vain
Watched my dreams crumble
But all along the way
Someone heard me pray
The house is quiet now and my, my heart is full
And all the ones I love lay fast asleep and I am complete
I turn out the light and I whisper goodnight
And I know, this is where I belong",Where I Belong

'Til this fire gets hotter
We could stand right here on the river bank

If we hesitate a moment to long
Our chance could be gone

On the tip of our tounge
Or come right out and say em
We could play these games

Than having to hold my breath like this
It's a feeling I can't ignore
Can't hold it back anymore

For there'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest

Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond the illusion
I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high
Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man

Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune, but I hear the voices say

And patted my back for something done right
There are things that I'd forgotten that I loved about the man
But I'll always remember the love in daddy's hands

Daddy's hands were hard as steel when I'd done wrong
Daddy's hands weren't always gentle but I've come to understand

Sacrificed unselfishly just to keep us all fed
If I could do things over, I'd live my life again
And never take for granted the love in daddy's hands

I'm alright.

Tonight, let's all get down on the floor
I'm feeling alright
I've got the need to explore
You can leave your inabitions

Leave them at the door
Nobody's uptight

You were the one that I had to make mine
I'd been watching everything that you do
Really like just to get to know you
Don't want anybody else, now
Won't stop 'til I'm hearin' the sound
Of the bottle spinnin' right towards you
Come help me break all the rules

At the ghost of a man who walks 'round in my disguise

But there's no welcome in the window anyway
And I look down for a number on my keychain
'Cause it feels more like a hotel everyday

But everybody says he's taken my place
There's a stranger in the house no one will ever see
But everybody says he looks like me

And now you say you've got no expectations
But I know you also miss those carefree days
And for all the angry words that passed between us

Lying by my side
When I go away I?ll miss you
And I will be thinking of you
Every night and day just ...

Rachelle Ann Go,"How can I convince you
What you see is real
Who am I to blame you
For doubting what you feel

I was always reachin'
You were just a boy
I knew I took for granted
The friend I have in you

I was living for a dream
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever
The search is over
You were with me all the while

Can we last forever
We'll we fall apart
At times it's so confusing
The questions of the haert

So if you ever loved me
And patiently you'd wait
Till I came to my senses
Through some miracle of faith

I was living for a dream
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever
The search is over
You were with me all the while

Now the miles stretch out behind me
Loves that I have lost
Broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck
It finally stuck like lightning from the blue
Every highway's leading me back to you

Now at last I hold you
Now all is said and done
The search has come full circle
Our destinies are one

So if you ever loved me
Show me that you gave a damn 
You'll know for certain
The girl I really am

I was living for a dream

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

And I know just what you've been going through
‘Cause I'm still here waiting for you!

Waitin' for the rain to flow

Wantin' to know why they did what they did and how
""Faith is the key"" he said, ""to what can't yet be seen""
Then he looked at the sky, winked at his wife and said,
""That's why baby, baby, baby?""

Make me sing in the morning
Make me smile at night
Laugh for no particular reason

No doubt about it, there's a higher power working in here!
There's a way to anything, anytime, anyway and anywhere
But it won't work if there's fear
If we put our trust in what we feel
Instead of what we think in our heads, hmm
Then we'll remember to keep it real
So the soul will be nourished and the spirit is fed!
Baby, baby, baby, baby

I'm so satisfied
I know that this joy can't be denied!
Make me sing in the morning
Make me smile at night
Laugh for no particular reason

Life is only what we allow it to be
There are no accidents and no mistakes
It really just depends on the choices we choose to make
Everything is everything anyway!

Make me smile at night

You can even take the damn goodbye
Better take what you can

Gotta put my tears aside
Because I'll never let you take my pride

It's cruel how she needs to see me ache
She'll know that it's real if she sees the hate
Did you really need to bring him here
Why can't we part with dignity?
It's a pity bout your insecurity

Can't believe it's over now
No need to work it out
I'm so relieved we never had a child
Well, it's over now and I'm breaking down
I gotta clean up this mess you made inside

Racionais MC's,"Um homen na estrada recomeça sua vida
Sua finalidade a sua liberdade
Que foi perdida, subtraída
E quer provar a si mesmo que realmente mudou
Que se recuperou e quer viver em paz
Não olhar para trás
Dizer ao crime: nunca mais!
Pois sua infância não foi um mar de rosas, não

Na FEBEM, lembranças dolorosas, então
Sim, ganhar dinheiro, ficar rico, enfim
Muitos morreram sim, sonhando alto assim
Me digam quem é feliz
Quem não se desespera vendo
Nascer seu filho no berço da miséria
Um lugar onde só tinham como atração
O bar, e o candomblé pra se tomar a benção
Esse é o palco da história que por mim será contada
Um homem na estrada

Equilibrado num barranco incômodo
Mal acabado e sujo, porém
Seu único lar, seu bem e seu refúgio
Um cheiro horrível de esgoto no quintal
Por cima ou por baixo, se chover será fatal
Um pedaço do inferno, aqui é onde eu estou
Até o IBGE passou aqui e nunca mais voltou
Numerou os barracos, fez uma pá de perguntas
Logo depois esqueceram, filhos da puta
Acharam uma mina morta e estuprada
Deviam estar com muita raiva
Mano, quanta paulada!
Estava irreconhecível, o rosto desfigurado

Deu meia noite e o corpo ainda estava lá
Coberto com lençol, ressecado pelo sol, jogado
O IML estava só dez horas atrasado
Sim, ganhar dinheiro, ficar rico, enfim
Quero que meu filho nem se lembre daqui
Tenha uma vida segura
Não quero que ele cresça com um ""oitão""
Na cintura e uma ""PT"" na cabeça
E o resto da madrugada sem dormir
Ele pensa o que fazer para sair dessa situação

Desempregado então
Com má reputação
Viveu na detenção
Ninguém confia não
E a vida desse homem para sempre foi danificada
Um homem na estrada
Um homem na estrada

Amanhece mais um dia e tudo é exatamente igual
Calor insuportável, 28 graus
Faltou água, ja é rotina, monotonia
Não tem prazo pra voltar, hã! Já fazem cinco dias
São dez horas, a rua está agitada
Uma ambulância foi chamada com extrema urgência
Loucura, violência exagerada
Estourou a própria mãe, estava embriagado
Mas bem antes da ressaca ele foi julgado
Arrastado pela rua o pobre do elemento
O inevitável linchamento, imaginem só!
Ele ficou bem feio, não tiveram dó
Os ricos fazem campanha contra as drogas 
E falam sobre o poder destrutivo delas
Por outro lado promovem e ganham muito 
Dinheiro com o álcool que é vendido na favela

Empapuçado ele sai, vai dar um rolê
Não acredita no que vê, não daquela maneira
Crianças, gatos, cachorros disputam palmo a palmo 
Seu café da manhã na lateral da feira
Molecada sem futuro, eu já consigo ver
Só vão na escola pra comer, apenas nada mais
Como é que vão aprender sem incentivo de alguém
Sem orgulho e sem respeito
Sem saúde e sem paz
Um mano meu tava ganhando um dinheiro
Tinha comprado um carro, até Rolex tinha!
Foi fuzilado a queima roupa no colégio

Abastecendo a playboyzada de farinha
Ficou famoso, virou notícia, rendeu dinheiro aos jornais
Ha!, cartaz à policia
Vinte anos de idade, alcançou os primeiros 
Lugares superstar do notícias populares!
Uma semana depois chegou o crack
Gente rica por trás, diretoria
Aqui, periferia, miséria de sobra

Um salário por dia garante a mão-de-obra
A clientela tem grana e compra bem
Tudo em casa, costa quente de sócio
A playboyzada muito louca até os ossos
Vender droga por aqui, grande negócio
Sim, ganhar dinheiro ficar rico enfim
Quero um futuro melhor, não quero morrer assim
Num necrotério qualquer, como indigente
Sem nome e sem nada
O homem na estrada

Assaltos na redondeza levantaram suspeitas
Logo acusaram a favela para variar
E o boato que corre é que esse homem está 
Com o seu nome lá na lista dos suspeitos
Pregada na parede do bar

A noite chega e o clima estranho no ar
E ele sem desconfiar de nada, vai dormir tranquilamente
Mas na calada, caguetaram seus antecedentes
Como se fosse uma doença incurável
No seu braço a tatuagem: DVC, uma passagem, 157 na lei
No seu lado não tem mais ninguém

A justiça criminal é implacável
Tiram sua liberdade, família e moral
Mesmo longe do sistema carcerário
Te chamarão para sempre de ex-presidiário
Não confio na polícia, raça do caralho
Se eles me acham baleado na calçada
Chutam minha cara e cospem em mim é
Eu sangraria até a morte já era, um abraço!
Por isso a minha segurança eu mesmo faço

É madrugada, parece estar tudo normal
Mas esse homem desperta, pressentindo o mal
Muito cachorro latindo
Ele acorda ouvindo barulho de carro e passos no quintal
A vizinhança está calada e insegura
Premeditando o final que já conhecem bem
Na madrugada da favela não existem leis
Talvez a lei do silêncio, a lei do cão talvez
Vão invadir o seu barraco, ""é a polícia""!
Vieram pra arregaçar, cheios de ódio e malícia
Filhos da puta, comedores de carniça!

Já deram minha sentença e eu nem tava na ""treta""
Não são poucos e já vieram muito loucos
Matar na crocodilagem, não vão perder viagem
Quinze caras lá fora, diversos calibres
E eu apenas com uma ""treze tiros"" automática
Sou eu mesmo e eu, meu Deus e o meu orixá
No primeiro barulho, eu vou atirar
Se eles me pegam, meu filho fica sem ninguém
É o que eles querem: mais um pretinho na FEBEM
Sim, ganhar dinheiro ficar rico enfim
A gente sonha a vida inteira e só acorda no fim
Minha verdade foi outra
Não dá mais tempo pra nada 

Homem mulato aparentando entre vinte e cinco e trinta 
Anos é encontrado morto na estrada do M'Boi Mirim sem número
Tudo indica ter sido acerto de contas entre quadrilhas rivais

And change I wish, for I will, 'cause it's gonna work
You can do this, it's your life

Follow the clouds and dive right in

Open this window, just let the wind blow in
And let it grab you and calm you down
And if there is no way, then find a way
But don't go down that easy way
And don't let any of them bastards hold you down

And all your dreams are gone if you let them go
And all the dreams you win, if your dare to make it so

You let them out, miss them while they're gone
But there's memories down here that will always live down here

Walk away
You're scared what to find so you just run and hide
You run away
If you play with a gun then you will shoot someone
When you sit in the fire it's your ass getting warm

Without me, without me, without me, without me

Why do yell, you can whisper as well
Walk away

Radam Schwartz,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

Like they were it's kids
Broken down, but still worth a lot to someone

Light from a dying moon
It blurs our eyes
And we wear a cape of fireflies
And after the world's in bed
All the ghosts come sing along

When the world turned wicked, when I joined their game

You split my skull and reached inside my head
And pulled out the pictures I'd been wishing I'd forget
And you stitched me up then
And wiped the blood from off my chin

Now I sit on the rooftop's edge
The muddy street beneath my swollen head
Trying to forget you
To believe we've never met

And the sky is wrecked, full of rotting clouds
From chimney mouths spewing smoke around
And I can't stop coughing
My lungs just won't calm down
But still I keep grinning
As the blood from my face stains the ground

A bird, caught in the wires
Bleating for help I can't provide, I'm not that big
I hope for the best but nothing changes, I'm sorry

Radical Face,"So we start with my father as a boy barely spoke a word of English 
Fell in love from a distance. 
He watched her working from the back fence
He learned some words and some clever turns of phrase from his father's book of poets
She wasn't taken in that instant, but grew impressed with his persistence

They met each other out by moonlight
Made love in the nearby woods
Then her folks became suspicious when her cycle broke that settled it
They stole away without their goodbyes
Got married in a foreign town
Made their way as best as they could
Found jobs and settled down
And then time moved on

I was born in a river of blood on sheets from the wedding day
The room was dark and the stench was thick
My father couldn't stand the smell of it
Mama died in the night cause the nearest doctor couldn't stem the blood loss
Father cried out on the back porch
My sister held me at the neighbor's house
Oh my there was a storm then, there was a flood of a different kind
Father's eyes were often vacant, but his hands were rarely quiet
Sister learned to take her hits well, both from life and the physical kind
But I was never one to lie down, despite picked the fight
So we designed our hells

Father turned into a drinker, a dark bastard with a wooden heart
Sister learned to be a mother, before she never played another part
And I became a little terror, I lashed out at whatever's around
Took some time before I settled, to find a mind that was somewhat sound
And like it always does, time rushed on

Six years later father dies in the very same bedroom
Many said it was the grief that did it
I have to say it's cause he hung himself
To be honest neither sister nor myself ever much regret his passing

I kept the questions to a murmur
You had an answer for them all
How am i take it home
How am i get you alone
How am i take you home
How am i get you alone
To remember why
They hung you out to dry
We're all alone
And unaware
You can't say what you want to say

I hope that you prepare

For enemies like this

Listen
Turn around
I always say it's gonna change now

Despite, we don't go anywhere now

Despite, no one goes anywhere now

Can you remember why
They hung us out to dry
We're all alone
