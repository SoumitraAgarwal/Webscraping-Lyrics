The Cure,"I woke up at seven and my body was vibrating
I was wrapped up in a blanket, I was gray, damp and sore
The bedroom was an engine and my heartbeat was erratic
Like I think, I'm at the racing, like the night before

I remember one girl standing, one was sitting on the ground
One was holding me up, the other pulling me down
And I couldn't decide which one was real
Because there wasn't a sound, like I was pregnant again

I woke up at seven and my body was vibrating
I was wrapped up in a blanket, I was gray, damp and sore
The bedroom was an engine and my heartbeat was erratic
Like I think, I'm at the racing, like the night before

""Don't move, don't smile, don't blink, don't even breathe""
And she said, ""Or the photograph will spoil and cut you off at the head""
So I was sucking, I was sucking like a fat lady would
But I couldn't hold it down another second

""Don't twitch, don't shout, don't think, don't even breathe""
She said, ""Or the photograph will spoil and cut you off at the head""
So I was sweating, I was sweating like a fat lady would
And I woke up with a man inside my mouth

This won't hurt at all
",A Man Inside My Mouth
The Cure,"No, I won't do it again, I don't want to pretend
If it can't be like before I've got to let it end
I don't want what I was, I had a change of head
But maybe someday, yeah, maybe someday

I've got to let it go and leave it gone
Just walk away, stop it going on
Get too scared to jump if I wait too long
But maybe someday, yeah

I'll see you smile as you call my name
Start to feel and it feels the same
And I know that maybe some day's come
Maybe some day's come again

So tell me some day's come
Tell me some day's come again

No I won't do it some more, doesn't make any sense
If it can't be like it was, I've got to let it rest
I don't want what I did, I had a change of tense
But maybe someday, yeah

I'll see you smile as you call my name
Start to feel and it feels the same
And I know that maybe some day's come
Maybe some day's come

If I could do it again maybe just once more
Think I could make it work like I did it before
If I could try it out, if I could just be sure
That maybe someday is the last time

Yeah, maybe someday is the end
Oh, maybe someday is when it all stops
Or maybe someday always comes again

Oh I don't think!

The Cure,"Shout
New day, new day

In Heaven the ground is waiting
For the dust, the seed, my love once more
I shout, shout this is new, new day, new day

Hold the air and gasp in life
This solid dance this cold, cold night is gone, is gone
The dark heat throbs, the fools' sweat swims
The hazy lights the deadly sins are gone, are gone

Crack the stone invade my head
Dropping honey, dropping dead again, again
The silence shouts across the gap
Another dreaming love me again, love me again

Shout, shout, shout
Love me again
Shout, shout, shout
",New Day
The Cure,"I've been up for days and I feel like a menagerie
I'm scratching 'til I bleed and I keep on seeing
Imaginary lemurs in the street in the middle of the day
But as long as I can breathe then I know I'll be okay

I'll be alright
I'm out of mind
I'm out of sight
I'm out of sight, yeah yeah

I've been up for days and I feel like a laboratory rat
Inside a maze and I reel in the monotony of
Screaming at the moon in the middle of the day
But as long as I can see it then I know I'll be okay

I'll be fine
I'm out of sight
I'm completely out of mind
Completely out of mind

Oh, oh, okay, alright
Come and watch me shake tonight
Mouth wide, soft and bright
Bite my hand and scream

Okay, alright
Come and watch me break tonight
Push deep out of sight
Bite my hand and hold on tight",Out of Mind
The Cure,"When we look back at it all,
As I know we will
You and me, wide-eyed
I wonder will we really remember
How it feels to be this alive
And I know we have to go
I realize
We only get to stay so long
We always have to go back to real lives
Where we belong
Where we belong
Where we belong

When we think back to all this
And I'm sure we will
Me and you, here and now
Will we forget the way
It really is
Why it feels like this
And how?
And we always have to go
I realise
We always have to say goodbye
Always have to go back to real lives
But real lives are the reason why
We want to live another life
We want to feel another time
Another time
Another time
To feel another time

When we look back at it all
As I know we will
You and me, wide-eyed
I wonder will we really remember
How it feels to be this alive

And I know we have to go
I realize
We always have to turn away
Always have to go back to real lives
But real lives are why we stay
For another dream, another day
For another world, another way
For another way

One last time before the end
One last time before it's time to go'again",Out of This World [Oakenfold Remix]
The Cure,"Electric line, racing time
Fire down the wall
Spinning around, the killing ground
It makes you look so small

Henna years, the stinging tears
Flesh on the railway track
The screaming queen on the TV screen
Is never coming back

Suffer no more
Step inside and listen
Listen to my pillbox tales

Your special days, your winning ways
You're living out the past
You're lying lies and tying ties
And running much too fast

But you feel so sick
If you run too quick and wishing every day
Wishing you were all along
Wishing you were years away

Suffer no more
Step inside and listen
Listen to my pillbox tales

Listen to my
Listen to my pillbox tales

Electric line, racing time
Fire down the wall
Spinning around, this killing ground
It makes you look so small

The henna years, the stinging tears
Flesh on the railway track
Jamming queen on the TV screen

The Cure,"Nothing I do makes much sense
Say you don't really get me anymore
I wonder if you ever did, if you ever did at all?

Nothing I want means a lot
Say you don't understand me like before
I'm not sure if you ever did, if you ever did at all?

Nothing I think has a point
Say you don't quite believe me anymore
I wonder if you ever did, if you ever did at all?

Gets hard to guess the best way through
The thing to do if none of this is true
I wish I knew how to undo
The doubt I hide inside
I grew in you

The knot I hide inside I tied in you,
Nothing I am shows the way
Say you don't seem to know me like before
I'm not sure if you ever did, if you ever did at all?

No nothing I do makes much sense
Say you don't really get me anymore
I wonder if you ever did, if you ever did at all?

Gets hard to guess the best way through
The thing to do if none of this is true
I wish I knew how to undo
The knot I tied in you,
When more or less the yes and no
Is all for show it isn't really so,
Look high and low where did we go?
You moved too fast or maybe I just moved too slow?

The Cure,"High up on this mountain
Oh the whole world looks so small
All the rivers run away
Slipping in your deep green heart
I drink you as I swim

And I'm sliding, and I'm sliding with you
Slide beneath my skin

Sleek and deep and salty sweet
You open up in me
Just like the snow in summer

High up on this mountain
Oh the whole world looks so small
All the rivers run away
Slipping in your soft white heart
I drink you as I swim

And I'm falling, and I'm falling with you
Fall beneath my skin

The Cure,"Let me forget, let me forget
Or let me go, let me go
I'll keep it quiet as a whisper
I'll keep it low, low, low
Low, low, low low, low

Never the biggest word I ever heard
S-s-stop dead, stop dead, s-s-stop dead
Getting too close, getting too close

Before you even opened your eyes
I've moved about a million ways
I've killed about a million people
And filled about half a day

Before you even opened your eyes
You had to have to ask me who
L-l-l-love it, I mean you

And swallowed me alive

The Cure,"Oh, I wish I could find it funny, you laughing like that

The Cure,"It's funny how your face gets bigger
Gets bigger in this atmosphere
And your mouth goes dry
With every move you try
It's so funny here

Jumping around
Click click click
When you're so slow
It's like the world is stopping

Fifteen times I try this
And every time I faint
You look at me and
Start to tell the joke
About the man who couldn't stop
Hiccuping

It would be so perfect
If you would just fall out the window
Throw your foot away
You're tired and your face is gray
Like the sad old fool
You groove

Around the world and back

And let my body do the talking

To the depths of the deepest sea
We won't need a map, believe me

And let my hands do the soothing

Another way

I buried the blame and I waited
Choked back years of memories

I pushed down the pain and I waited
Trying to forget

Another way
You promised me another dream
Another day

Sense of a rich man, knowledge and the rhythm
This is what I'm using to come up with a style
So I'll interact altogether better with the crowd
Nervous for a second then the record starts spinnin'
And I fall into the state of mind of what I'd just created
Pump it like the Dr. D into the R.E. suckers ready to leap
Up on the tip when we made it
Creative so I'll never be regarded as a regular
More than just a little bit better than my competitor
You should never underestimate the fashion

Equals an artist that won't' be worn, what is that Dre?

It's like a message that only I could understand
But those who want to comprehend will again
Be in the midst of the brother
Unlike another in any way
'Cause Dre don't play, say what the other say
Originality is a must whenever I bust
A funky composition, it's crush and I trust that you
Know it when you hear a funky record with potential

Equals the DOC, what is it Dre?
Yo, that's the formula

Keepin' it dope as long as I can like imagine
Makin' each record that I do better than the last one
Take a little time, choose the topic and drop it
Release it, the science of makin' dope beats with
Rhythmic American poetry
Shipped it to stations, now many people know of me
I'm the D. into the O. and the O. into the C. and the C. into the period
Suckers are fearing' this
When heard, the dope style calculated by the great wait
And take just a second to get caught up in my record
new but not a kid to be worn
If something' gettin' torn up then I'm doin' the
Tearin', not bein' torn
Shapin up to be one for the top vocalist lyricist
And when you hear of this
You shouldn't choke on this
Knowledge and the talent makes it valid
For me to get it patented
Dre, tellin' what I'm rappin'
The formula
In effect and I'm smooth, that's why I'm on the incline
Suckers frontin' for nothin' 'cause I'm goin' to get mine
It's in the cards and I thank I might have read this
so don't' lie and try to front like someone said this
Most who know thoughts served by the DOC see
That it's a mission impossible, tryin' to rock me
For an arena who'd ask me to perform for her

Then I take advantage, you can't manage
To get up, all you can do is sit up, I get lit up
Hit up, Ice Cube tearing shit up
Like a dude you can bet on
Collide like a head on
Collision, stutter stepping is an incision
Of a nigga saying exactly what I vision
Because I'm gone, you think I left you all
But I stay in yo' ass like cholesterol
When I blast some solid ass Alcatraz
And if you escape, you better swim fast
'Cause I'll catch ya, physically and mentally
And the capital punishment's the penalty
Sitting in the electric chair, grab a hold
Pull the switch, yo' body twitch, your eye's explode
Out your skull 'cause being dull on a flow
Is an N-O, niggas didn't know that I can go
Off and show off to throw off the law
Turn, take 10 paces then draw
What's left is a motherfucker dead in the alley

Yea, yea that was funky but we need the motherfucking villian to speak
So kick it

[MC Ren]
The grand finale, yo, it's my turn to bust
So let weak motherfuckers turn to dust
If you're weak it ain't my fault
Just take a kick in the ass and get turn into a pillar of salt
And niggas that's biting just to taste me
I make the punk motherfuckers buckle up for safety
And on the dope they caught from the flash
And swing like a bit when he's caught in a whiplash
Giving him pain 'cause I'm urgent
Rearrange the motherfucking face like a surgeon
It ain't no excuse for the torture delivering
Don't say that I scare you, I can tell 'cause your shivering
Lyrics label wit an X and not a G
I say fuck the police, yo, so now they after me
I'm wanted by the law so I stay low
Representing the pimp, bitches making my dough
In a different stage, I must of went on a rampage
Me and the D.O.C. are always hitting the front page
For what, for stealing and stepping up to the sheriff
And when I enter the party, niggas shit in a (cell pimp)
For what, maybe 'cause I'm Ren
And when they clean up shit, yo, they do it again
So fuck it, sit back cool and relax
While Eazy busts the facts kicking the grande finale

[Dr. Dre]
Yea, y'all know what time it is. Easy motherfucking E is in the house doing
Damage

[Eazy E]
The name is Eazy for me to come off like the inforcer'
Mass murder motherfuckers in a course of
An everyday situation where I would stalk by
Fuck the car, I do a motherfucking walk-by
Eazy-E and the D.O. to the C. and
Run house and there won't be no disagreeing
'Cause if there is some, you feeling staticy
Then I'm arrested (For what) assault and battery
Never outdone, only outdoing
Loving the bitches and the hoes boo hooing
Why 'cause they're addicted to my dick
The pleasure of pain, the wing-ding and flipped it
(Yea) and never forget when done in bed by
Eazy, the name of a Compton hard head
Cool but local like loc never broke
'Cause they're paid to be Ruthless, this is why I do this
I don't give a fuck about fame
I rather deal wit a number than a motherfucking name (word)
Get me paid and then rap
'Cause all the other bullshit money ain't jack
Eazy but not that Eazy to deal wit
Especially if you're popping bullshit
Put the E-A-Z-Y and to the E
Expression of thought on the motherfucking grand finale

[Dr. Dre]
Yea, that shit was funky, last but not least is the motherfucking D.O.C.
This is your album, so that means you definitely got to get funky, so run it

[The D.O.C.]
Swinging, singing a brand new rap
On a rhythm concocted by my homie in the back and
If it makes you giggle, it must be kinda funny
But to me it's kinda cool (Tell 'em why), I'm making money
Tripping up the man wit the (swig tan) movement
Proving if you're grooving then it cool when he be doing it
Taking a second for me to blow your mind
'Cause I'm the diggy diggy D.O.C. and I would've been down wit rock
But I was smart, the D.O. to the C. now on the formula
It's rough, I mean it's funky enough for me
And you can have a listen after that and this and
D-O-N-'T M-O-V-E wit out permission
From the D.O. to the C., I'm just better than
The normal man and I'll be dumb if a sucker can
Ever compete wit the elite
Much less beat, it's like dancing wit 2 left feet
Never smile when the D.O.C. is in the room
Or I'm a send ya ass to the temple of doom
I got raw when I came to Cali
Now wit NWA on the motherfucking grand finale

[Dre]
Shout outs",The Grand FinalĂŠ
The D.O.C.,"One, and here comes the two to the three and four
Then I drop the beat I have in store
Lay dynamics on the top like a rug
Make it sound smooth and later make a dub
An MC ate well, so that you can tell
I am not illiterate, no not even a little bit
Nothing like an idiot, get it?
You want the record, cool, I'm with it
Let the rhythm take you, shake it cause it makes you
As I turn the knob of the door you escape through
Go in like a knot, don't be a puff
And I let it play cause Dre's getting funky enough

	It's getting funky, it's getting funky (Repeat 3x)
	Watch the smooth lyrics that take place

If you want another reason why it must be funky
Yo I am not a jackass meaning not a donkey
So I will play the game like it should be played
Drop the funk into the mix so the place will never fade
Ship it the the stations in your jurisdiction
Others say I'm dope, and the others say I'm bitching
No crowd can avoid the D-O to the see
When I'm P-E-are-F-O-are-M-I-N-G
On the stage, see the simple fact is I engulf
And known, I rock a funky beat without a cord so
It is my conclusion you will enjoy the fusion
And I will ascend with the style I am using
Knowing that it's tough and it's not a bluff
I think I'll let it play cause Dre's hitting funky enough

	It's getting funky, it's getting funky (Repeat 3x)
	Dre make the funky hip-hop music so check it

Listen to the kick drop in with the click
And with no rehearses I'm dropping funky verses
Stupid with the bit that you think you are relying on
You love it when it rattles is the fact that I'm buying on
Suckers never come close cause of knowing
There is no stopping the D.O.C. when I'm flowing
But in the event that someone will try and juice this
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
I don't give a damn, don't think that I am joking
Cause I don't think he is funny when you're messing with my money
Yo people tell me this: ""Yo Dre you must stop him""
But with no frills, so I just drop him
Continue with the rhyme and make sure I get mine
With no static cause that's all I need to get my nine, but
Lessons have been learned now all kidding have been fronting
Let it play when the people say ""Dre yo you're getting funky enough""

	It's getting funky, it's getting funky (Repeat 3x)
	Deal with the D-O to the see

I'm your break so I can check around
See who the hell who is sitting down
I want all chairs off the floor
And if he stands to the wall, show him the door
And the PK nothing giving you something to rock to
To go nonstop to, not have to look at the clock you
Percieve, but can't believe you're being taken
By a beat so cool you start shaking
And shivering, cause I'm delivering the answer
Haven't seen you're a hellified dancer
You tried sitting but it just won't work
Cause the beat is to fresh
Don't even tell it won't be funky enough

	It's getting funky, it's getting funky (Repeat 3x)
	And with the help of the Dr. Dre, kick it

	It's getting funky on the mix now, right (Repeat 4x)
	Put it in the needle, and drop it on the one, boy",It's Funky Enough
The D.O.C.,"Together we witness one of the most delightful in our times
So um, let the bass go

Nah, it's got to go a little lower than that, Dre, drop it!
Nah, it's gotta go even lower than that, you know why?  (Why?)

You've been denied, although you've tried
So I've been a ving to make you fall like a tide
No disappointment, cause my beat will sooth like an ointment
Suckers with static approach and get rolled and smoked like a joint
Phlegm ignites the flame, I mean I burn like a lighter
Roll with the hip-hop groove cause I'm a writer
The hero of great, take a stand and we'll see
Eat in chronological order starting with me
A rap introduction, the suckers distruction
Yeah, are all involved when I started conducting
The lyrics are the maximum, I stated for facts in them
Chumps never try to break knowing I'd wax them
Murder in the first degree
Occurs only when dealing with the D-O to the see
I'm like a whirlwind pyramid, and I'm letting you know
I get ill when I hear the bass go

Yeah, that's the sound and you know it's down
But you know why? (Why's that?)

Cause I've been around, and you've heard the sound
Of the D.O.C. and the new style that I've found
It's quite unorthodox, but still bass and
Enough to make you dance, so I picked up the pace and
Let it ride like a cyclist
And see it show in the end that I'm the mightiest
And I'm lyrically inclined to make you want to step to my time
The beat and the cut to this rhyme
Do a show, and I'm good to like a G-O
Never getting skeezed, I mean it's like an N-O
Happiness to me is like a positive cash flow
So I let your ear cold hear when the bass go

Drop that bass (Aight, bet)

I don't want to (stop), cause if I do you might lose it
I made this record for you to jam, so use it
Kill the treble, pump the bass and then
Send the suckers on the block into a tailspin
Roll by, booming like a nuke bomb
I know there's pressure on your ears, but stay calm
After you pass, though, you better turn it down some
Or else you're gonna put a dent into your eardrum
Success realize on the individual
I feel successful when receiving the residual
But as for you, you all should know
When I say ""Let's get hype"" I'm letting the bass go

Now that's the way it should be done
I know that's on the one, and that is fun

To see a sucker standing weary
And girlies on the tip standing near me
The bass was the topic so I dropped it
Added some dop lyrics and then I dropped it
On track 24 in a machine
To make you move on the hip-hop scene
Cued up Dre, and I knew that he would know
That on the one, I would let the bass go
Because a dope jam is what I gotta make
I make it rattle cause you love it when it vibrates
The D-O and to the see
Must cause pleasure when showing yo my abilities
To inject on the set mass enjoyment
This is to insure definite employment
When I hit town, yo you'll know
Crowds will roar, and you'll hear the bass go

Yeah, let the bass go
This is most definitely down with my homeboy DJ Speed, is that on track?
Word em up, peace",Let the Bass Go
The D.O.C.,"High energy flowin' with the wisdom
Sense of a rich man, knowledge and the rhythm
This is what I'm using to come up with a style
So I'll interact altogether better with the crowd
Nervous for a second then the record starts spinnin'
And I fall into the state of mind of what I'd just created
Pump it like the Dr. D into the R.E. suckers ready to leap
Up on the tip when we made it
Creative so I'll never be regarded as a regular
More than just a little bit better than my competitor

It's like a message that only I could understand

Unlike another in any way
'Cause Dre don't play, say what the other say
Originality is a must whenever I bust
A funky composition, it's crush and I trust that you
Know it when you hear a funky record with potential
Me gettin' hype 'cause Dre rockin' the instrumental
Nothing like what you've heard before and more, never less
See I don't Fess, I mean I'm like fresh if not the freshest

Hooked because I cook when I pick up a pen

Rhythmic American poetry

Suckers are fearing' this
When heard, the dope style calculated by the great wait
And take just a second to get caught up in my record
new but not a kid to be worn
If something' gettin' torn up then I'm doin' the
Tearin', not bein' torn
Shapin up to be one for the top vocalist lyricist
And when you hear of this
You shouldn't choke on this
Knowledge and the talent makes it valid
For me to get it patented
Dre, tellin' what I'm rappin'
The formula
In effect and I'm smooth, that's why I'm on the incline
Suckers frontin' for nothin' 'cause I'm goin' to get mine
It's in the cards and I thank I might have read this
so don't' lie and try to front like someone said this
Most who know thoughts served by the DOC see
That it's a mission impossible, tryin' to rock me

Hey

Welcome
To
The new world

I'd like to make a small dedication tonight to the bitches of the world
Now to make this understood, I'm gonna explain somethin' to you
(biatch!)
Check this out
Bitch!
To be a bitch, you don't necessarily have to have a pussy in your pants
(True indeed, true indeed)
In fact
Most, if not all, of the bitches I know (That's right)
Have little peckers, little dicks
?

A bitch ain't nothin'
But a muthafucka that wanna come up
From another muthafucka
Hard work
Don't make no sense to these muthafuckas
Dumb ass muthafuckas
Now to make it real clear I'm gonna explain it to ya in a story form
Like this here
Check this out

I remember the way it started
Once upon a time
When a nigga named Dre came, nigga got signed
Ruthless nigga, everything is all good
You the shit, 'cause you rollin' wit' some Boyz-N-the-Hood
No One Can Do it Better, see, 'cause I'm an M-D
And when I fuck it up, you give me 25 G's
Eazy-E said, ""Yeah, oh yeah!""
So I took it
Forget the paperwork
The money made me overlook it

I rose up quick from the pit I was in
450 0300 Benz
Nothin' but ends, money bought friends
Got me in a cross ?
Now everything's lost
This is when I found out
""Look at this shit!""
You is slippin'
You ain't gonna believe what that nigga did
""My shit fucked up, Dre, you need to look""
""I ain't trippin', yo, I think your little homie, he a crook""

The spot got shook, it was hell below
Is that the future shock?
Hell, no, it's Death Row
I was all in because of the begin
Think they would see
Yo, we all gon' win
So ""The Chronic"" was upon us, the music awards
But I was still broke at the crib when they toured
The album soared and I got bored
With niggas talkin' shit, they came upon a ?

Ain't that a bitch?

I coulda been the star dude
Or maybe I shoulda stabbed out like Ice Cube
But what about your Dogg?
Who? Snoop? We was tight
I hung around, we'd get together when he'd write
In the Pound, that's the way it come to ?
When it's goin' down, niggas is in whatever
I went outside for a minute and came back
Niggas was talkin' crazy like they wanted me to rap
So I did somethin' from the old LP
""Damn! That's that shit!""
""That's what a nigga want to see""

Visit the Windy City and ?
Rock over 17,000 G's
I recognized game
The shit was kinda funny
Fucked-up voice shit, nigga make money
He came back and here comes the glory
And this is the way I'm gonna end this story

I was only 19
Lookin' for a dream
From what I put out
I never got a fuckin' thing
This and the wreck was the fucked-up part
It's just a little somethin' about some real heart

From Ruthless to Death Row do we all part
Bitches, see ya
Trick-ass, trick-ass bitch
Trick
Trick-ass

La-la-la

(Once upon a time not long ago)
(A brother tried to play me like a kid, so I just dissed him)

(It's like a message that only I can understand)

(Keepin' it dope as long as I can rock a mansion)
(Remember this forever!)

To see her body at two minutes at a time

I'll tell you now man well it ain't easy
She's never coming home
I spent my nights alone

Down at the peepshow!
My baby's dancing tonight
Just down at the peepshow!
She'll be shaking for some other guy

I'm one of many
She's all I've got
Well I take my money
And push it in the slot
When she starts moving then I don't feel so alone
I can almost imagine
That were back at home!

I'll tell you now man now it ain't easy
Always trying to catch and run
She won't come home
Oh No she won't come home!

The Dambuilders,"She doesn't speak much English
But she tells me all her favorite bands 
There's not too much to talk about
Wonder if she understands 

I know she likes L7 
And I think that she likes me 
When she rolls her stockings past the knee
We're talking rock and roll... 

And now it seems like yesterday 
I met her in a smoky club 
If you get drunk and fall behind 
You know that I will put you up 

And if I learned the language 
She could tell me all her dreams 
I know exactly what she means 

And I could fall so easily 
Because her hair is colored red 
I asked her if she'll dye mine too 
She tells me it's already dead 

And I knew that if I stayed with her 
I'd lose track of all time

Take me back to when I was eight
But I don't mean to pray

They're ignorant, I don't understand

And seek guidance from the pedlars of hope
As you know I used to go there myself
Until the day I became antipope

That the vicar's a transvestite
With a fetish for ropes and gowns

I guess I'm just a rotten swine
Who takes his time
And walks for fun when she should run
The damaged one is you old chum

Who's the sucker now

Could someone shed some light on this love affair
And help to make me quite aware
Of what is meant by wicked thoughts

To where once islands cried
And there sometimes angels can be devils too

When shadows no longer fall
And footsteps can't be heard at all

Get up and tell you where to go
And you've just had some kind of mushroom
And your mind is moving slow

Go ask Alice

When logic and proportion have fallen [unverified] dead
And the white knight is talking backwards
And the red queen's lost her head

And one pill makes you fall

But when your habit does all the talking
Yeah, you'd say anything

Now you've just lost all your money
And you've been thrown out of your home
But for that one more gram of cocaine
You'd sell your very soul

Slippers on must get along to where the action's at

And so the day breaks over motley cat and me
I read the Sunday paper and have a nice cup of tea

And so into the kitchen wondering, what I did last night
And open up the corn flakes that they says nutra sheds delight
Rummage in the sink to find a plate, it's almost clean
I think this is the worst state that the kitchen's ever been

That's the way I like to see myself; reaching for just one star at a time. 

I heard what was a song inside the earth. I put my ear to the ground and I sang with every word.

There was a sun in my eyes that made
A star out of me. 
It's like my life was a list and my head was first
To get crossed off. 
It's the pleasure that I keep to sit down with my

Remember Winnipeg and feeling simpler back then?
I took a week off from my band and flew out
It was a Saturday, I saw you waiting by the plane

I was always in a way, just a long shot
I was never in the clear of that
I am lucky just to be a potential
But I will always make a mess of that, of that, of that

I traded symmetry for everything I loved
I took my feelings out and I had told you I was done
I know your mistakes, does that bother you
That I found where they stay? Can I reach you yet?

I stood up so fast and I let you down
It was the first time that I heard, I heard that sound
It filled my head with the darkest shade of black
And I met you there, I realized then
That I was just a little sad and I left you there

I was always in a way, just a long shot
I was never in the clear of that
I am lucky just to be a potential
But I will always make a mess of that

In the same clothes from the very last night
I wanna pray that I am doing everything right

I saw my mom die for the very first time
She was an angel, God took her from the sky
And there's a million other people
That I found who cared more than I ever will

I held that note out
I grabbed my bag and I left through the door
I let my hair grow
Put these words on my skin I cannot relate

Would you believe in my songs if I gave them all to you?
I can't find the strength in my voice to call you back
And say that everything is bad without you
And I am lost again, God believe I'm lost again

I stayed in bed and you took so much that I couldn't even sleep
I waited so long though that wasn't even that bad
I never had to be a part of the world and I've been making that a goal
For reasons that I cannot explain

Well, I'm an optimist but only in a perfect world
I think I'm too stained with all the negativity
From all the people in my way

Would you believe in my songs if I gave them all to you?
I can't find the strength in my voice to call you back
And say that everything is bad without you
And I am lost again, oh God believe I'm lost again

Would you believe in my songs if I gave them all to you?

And say that everything is bad without you
And I am lost again, oh God believe I'm lost again

I took a trip down south, I felt the sun on my face
And it made things okay for a second
I drew a picture of my problems
When I was going insane and I focused on the currents

It's the funny thing about it, I never seem to worry
That every single current's not the same
It's all about position and where I choose to lay
And God I am going away

Would you believe in my songs if I gave them all to you?
I can't find the strength in my voice to call you back
And say that everything is bad without you
And I am lost again, oh God believe I'm lost again

Would you believe in my songs if I gave them all to you?

I really lost a lot of things
I can barely speak
And I'm hardly sober
Taking good memories and wiping that slate clean
I was trying to get it out
Some how, right now I'm still standing here

Through the rain
In the morning I see May

I don't mind waking up alone
As long as you still feed that dream
Of moving out to Angel City
No, no one's stopping you
Nothing's holding you back
Honestly, 'cause I still care

Are you lying on your back?
Are you lying?
Are you settling again?
Well I'm not silenced
It's not about the way we cut clean
We both said a lot
And even though we both may not speak
You are the song I wrote that I will always love
And I will always know
And I will never take our time for granted
Honestly so
And even when we are grown
Take everything we own
Try to put all the pictures in your memories so
I lost you

Surrender your soul
Open up your heavy heart door

Once you make your mind up

But if you die, then you will live forever

I just fall on the trust
That won't let me go, ?cause?
My strength is only as strong
As my faith in You, my faith in You

And my life is built upon
My faith in You, my faith in You
This life can turn on a dime
Without a reason or rhyme
My dreams are shattered

Is all that matters

Should we exist just to live and die'

From where I am to where You are seems like an eternity
Can You still forgive somebody like me
Can You forget the way that I used to be
Lord, I'm down on my knees praying
That You could still love, love somebody like me

For so long I did things my own way
I sure made my share of mistakes
So many wounds that need to start healing
It's so much more than I can take

I know that I used to seem to have all the answers
Then how'd I ever get so lost
Now this road that's paved with my regrets
Is leading back to the cross

Take me into your arms where forever is waiting to start
Turning me into every dimension of you I am able to be
Here I am, reaching out, will you please
Take me, Take me

Take me through life
Take me to people that you want me near
Walking with me
Holding my soul through the laughter and tears
Take me to where I am knowing you
In the deepest way
And one day when you say my work is done
My time has come, you'll hear me say

You can't run it, you can't hide it, you can't run it

You don't run it, you don't hide it, you don't run it
Don't end your faith in love because of what he's done.
So if you just put your hand in mine,
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind.
Keep on walking and don't look back.
Forget about the past now.
Don't look back, baby.

Love can be a beautiful thing.
Though your first love let you down.
'Cause I know we can make love bloom, baby.
The second time around.
So if you just put your hand in mine,
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind.
Keep on pushing and don't look back.

It said 'I left tonight'
But I treated her right
I treated her right, I treated her right
I treated her right, I treated her right, yeah

Broke down on the doorstep
Tear come to my eye
Should've believed that woman
She could tell no lie, she could tell no lie

Knock on the door next evening
A shadow, a familiar outline
Yes she come up and smile at me
And I know I'm gonna feel fine

My futures looking bright and rosy
My girls best friend puts her hand in mine
Now I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright

Now I'm feeling, now I'm feeling

Pussy hole was addicted to drinking, now I'm addicted to crack rock
So motherfuck you bitches and you snitches tryin' to do me in
Police in disguises and he tries to buy Peruvian
Knockin at my fuckin' door, duckin' and dodgin' on that floor

Creepin' up out my window pane, I smell cops
A honkey's on the block, drop to my knee, I took a shot
I seen him drop, one time this ain't the place for that
Since he's a fed, I took off his face for that
That shit that he tried to pull
And you know he couldn't get away with this

Fuck being indicted, don't you try it that's the fuckin' story

I'm fittin' to stir it, rock it up, so where's my silver spoon
I put my yea out on the block, and all you hear is boom
This is my set, so you can jet, or get that sweater wet
A fed is bloody, he's been wounded by a fucking tech
Rat tat to the tat tat, I'mma take him out of his memory
For ridin' my nuts and tryin' to stick me with delivery
Loose lips sink ships, so this is do or die

We heartless, we takin' you out the game and that's regardless
Them partners, they fuckin' it up again and plus they fault us
Remember, the niggas that reppin' the ave they drop them bolo's
Or fold those, we spendin' them dates instead of them mo mos
We tiptoes, do you remember the way that we ripped those, like 4-4's
We breakin' it down so fuck you hoes
Do you remember Shoestring, but fuckin' it up cold as the winter
Remember you rappers be runnin' your mouths, but you all beginners
Quit actin, you bitches been suckin' my dick but now you packin and jackin'
Fuckin' around with us, you hoes subtractin'
Remember when dope was whoopin' yo ass from start to ending
Stop bending, we bustin' you up again yo head we sending
Keep walkin', we done check yo nuts before but you still talkin' and stalkin'
Quit suckin' up on my dick bitch, you ain't barkin'
I said it, I'm chasin' you up and out and down you headed, get leaded
Fuckin' around with Dayton bitch I'll go get it
Remember the honkies that finish you off just like a fender
You tender, stickin' you in yo neck 'cause our agenda, you leakin'
Robbin' you for yo shit, you know we creepin', you peekin'
Checkin' us up and down 'cause we some heathens
Bootzilla, blastin' on these bitches, we some killas
From the Dorseys to the Millers

Do you remember when mama was mama and daddy in one

Now it begun in 1991, Dayton Family tape out
E-40 dropped that cap and saved a home for fools with no clout
I remember rappin' under these streetlights when shit was cool
Or battle rappin' in the hallways of a fellow middle school
It wasn't polite to do cocaine in public if you was cute and pretty
Once when my mind dropped and that shit stopped, fucked up the whole city
Do you remember the days and nights when you were broke and lonely
No money, everyone inside your household was hungry, and bumy
I remember my neighbor was telling me to watch my mouth
Our lights was out, we runnin' extension cords from house to house
And fuck some cable, we had barely drug in a dining room table
Hella hot main-meals, chicken pot pies
Remember runnin' with gang bangers and fuckin' up tramp-ass-hoes
Mama I ain't goin' to school today wearin these same old clothes
Do you remember the look in her eye when she made you a meal
And you didn't eat it, and all them tears she shed
Beside your bed over things that you needed
I still remember the way that I felt when I picked up a gun
I still remember the tears that I shed when my cousin was blasted with one
Do you remember the way that you felt when you walked out of prison
Or do you remember the pain that you felt
From them sendin you back for no reason
I still remember the way that the ball bounce
Insufficient bank accounts
Guns and triggas is all that counts
I'm robbin' you bitches for different amounts
I'm losin' myself and I can't be found
The niggas out now are still firing rounds
Stuck on the ground, my son's outta town
September eleventh has swallowed me now

Do you remember when the days were short and the nights were long

The Dayton Family,"[Shoestring - talking]
I'm ready to tell you my secret now
I see dead people, but they don't know that they're dead
And sometimes, when it get real cold, that means they're mad

[Shoestring - singing]
Can't go to sleep I hear a beat, it sounded just like feet
Jump off my seat, see they hit my window, cause I gots the beat
I've seen a shadow pulling cattle from an early battle
I've seen this snake up in my shoe and all I heard was rattle (rattle sound)

Picked up the phone and it exploded like a fucking bomb
I'm seeing shadows biting me like they was Jeffrey Dahm
So many clicks, so many crews trying to blow my fuse
So many shadows in my yard that I feel abused (gong sound)

I'm hearing voices in my head and I can see a tread
I'm seeing scores, a pitbull and he's smelling dead
Slipped on my slippers, the ones with the chromed zippers
Knocked out a shadow in my room, all these Jack the Rippers

I fight with tigers, the shadows say they're Michael Myers
Just like Jack Nickleson played ""The Wolf"" I hear my neighbors driers
All this pain in my brain makes me go insane
I'm hearing chains and tracks and running trains (train running, gong sound)

A lot of these soldiers in my kitchen with their bloody blades
No hands, no knives, just bodies and their hand grenades
I started ducking, them soldiers started busting at me
Flashbacks when I was two father hollered at me

Hearing whistles the click from pistols got me live annoyed
Past beef won't let me rest, I live like Sleepy Froyd
All these songs in my head and can't nobody tattle
Last night I killed two more, here comes another shadow (echos, gong sound)

[Bootleg - talking]
We're all walking in the valley of the shadow of death
So concentrate on your family, friends and loved ones
Because you never know when there's a shadow

[Chorus: Kalonda, Ryan]
Shadow, every time I turn around there's a shadooooow
Though I walk through the valley of a shadooooow (gong sound)
Life's too short to take for granted fearing shadooooow
I can't take this pain I'm feeling from these

[Bootleg]
Woke up, hopped out the bed this morning, felt somebody watching
Opened my door no one was there I swear I hear'em knocking
Cocking my pistol cause I'm paranoid and in a zone
Somebody said whip me, but I know I'm home alone (gong sound)

Jumped in the shower, trying to wash away this eary feeling
Walked out my bathroom seeing shadows dancing on the ceiling
Put on my clothes and smoked a cigarette and brushed my grill
My pitbull Puppy barking at so what I know ain't real (dogs barking)

Turned on my T.V. watching CNN, I heard a boom (explosion)
Two shadows having sex, I hear'em fucking in my room
Exit my residence the only face's a gust of wind (wind whistling)
Too hard for wind, a shadow's what it must have been

Ain't no such things as ghosts, I'm tripping dawg and I know it
Walked towards my car, the horn went off, a shadow had to blow it (car honks)
I need a drink to think and sort out all these weird events
I killed a man, my life's been haunted ever since

I can't believe the shit I'm seeing turning up my bottle
I keep my eyes and I'll rip you, I swear I'm being followed
Can't goto sleep at night unless I take a sleeping pill
Reflections in the mirror fucking with my head for real (gong sound)

I never thought that there was nothing wrong with how I think
Until my momma told me: 'Leg, go see a shrink!
All these songs in my head and can't nobody tattle
Last night I killed two more, here comes another shadow

[Chorus]

[Bootleg - talking]
I thank God every morning when I wake up
'Cause you never know when you're gonna walk out your front door
And get murdered in your driveway
So I'll be telling you this: Keep your mind on your family, friends, and foes

'Cause most niggas is hoes (gong sound)
And they shoot you cause you bawling more than they is
So stay out them whole in the Warclubs
Nigga show love to your family and friends
And get your ass, fuck'em

The Dead Milkmen,"Built ourselves a city
And we made it out of mud
We dried it off this morning
Out there in the desert sun
And we never do no working
Just sit and watch TV
Well, I finally found a city
Full of people just like me

Well we're gonna drag Bruce Springsteen
By his axe through our streets
By the time we're done The Boss
Will look like a side of beef
We've got plans for other wankers
Who might come through our town
Why'know we're going to rid the world
Of those Top-40 clowns
Then we're going to buy some bombs
Just like the big boys have
So don't call us losers
Or you might just make us mad!

Built ourselves a city
And we propped it up with wood
We were drunk when we made it
Hell! We did the best we could
And still we don't do no working
Just sit and watch TV
Well, I finally found a city
Full of people just like me

Someone tried to build a health spa
But we quickly burned it down
'Cause we don't want any healthy people
Ruining our town
Why'know, we used to have a K-Mart
We burnt that sucker too
'Cause they wouldn't let you in
Without a shirt or shoes
And we never paved the roads
We just bought VCR's
When you got good movies
Hell, you don't need any cars

Built ourselves a city
And we call it WiseGuyVille
And we made a few mistakes
Like putting children on the pill
And we never do no working
'Cause we got cable TV
Hell, I finally found a city
Full of people just like me

Someday we'll have a new land
From sea to shining sea
Someday we'll have a country
Full of people just like me

I'm so happy I just can't wait
Gonna see the place where Elvis Presley died

When we get to Graceland
We'll have to ride a bus
We'd better watch our language
Or the guards will beat us up

We'll get to make some cheap jokes
And buy cheaper souvenirs
If this were Disneyworld
I'd buy a pair of Elvis ears

Where they keep all his records
And his fifteen foot long couch

That's how I wanna go

That it's sad The King is gone
Well, Elvis might be dead
But his cash flow lives on

When I see the Jungle Room
Where Elvis made some records
Including Moody Blue

And I just can't stay away
We're goin' to Graceland today

",Bad Party
The Dead Milkmen,"""Bleach Boys""
By The Dead Milkmen
From Beelzebubba
(c) 1988
I've got some buddies and we all drink bleach
You know we practice what we preach
We're not a drunken bunch of frat boys drunk on beer
Or a stoned bunch of hippies with no careers
I wanna drink bleach with a Georgia Peach
My pals and I all drink Clorox
Or eat Snowy right out of the box
Teenage suicide rate shot high and we
Understand the reason why
Bleach does more than whiten socks
Don't you wanna hang out with the bleach boys baby
In a land where ministers murder golf pros?
Don't you wanna drink some bleach tonight?
Maybe there'll be a party at the beach
We'll bitch about life and chug-a-lug bleach
No ones getting high and no one's getting drunk
We got a case off bleach stashed in the trunk.
I wanna die with clorox within reach.
I'm very proud of the respect I've earned
And my voice is very deep 'cause my throat got burned.
Bleach keeps you young so I've been told
'cause no one who drinks it lives to be old
Drink it with a chaser is the first thing I learned.
Don't you wanna hang out with the bleach boys baby
In a land where midgets run for mayor?
Don't you wanna drink some bleach tonight?
I had 26 friends in the beginning
But now it seems our numbers are thinning
Some people drive fast others love to bet
Still others snort coke in a private jet.
But drinking bleach is my way of winning.

I'm so bored I'm drinking bleach (x472)

",I Walk the Thinnest Line
The Dead Milkmen,"I ran into a friend of mine
Said he was gonna take some words and make them rhyme
I said ""You can fool some of them some of the time,
But you can only fool half them all of the time""
He said ""Yes I do believe this is true,
Would you like to come and sniff some glue?
And we'll fly to where the skies are blue
And look for things both bright and new""

And on a pretty Sunday morning
A bunch of pretty Baptist girls
Linked their pretty hands and they sang
Life is shit, life is shit
The world is shit, the world is shit
This is life as I know it
This is life as I know it

And in the sky I saw Richard Nixon
Smoking a lacey with Mr. Dickson
He said ""Son there's something I must say,
I do believe I've found a better way""
And a vision came
And I new it was Bob Crane
And Bob sang:

Life is shit, life is shit
The world is shit, the world is shit
This is life as I know it
This is life as I know it

And when my friend and I were done
We went to rest upon the sun
Cause life takes from us the things we love
And it robs us of the special ones
And it puts them high where we can't climb
And we only miss them all the time

And we sing:
Life is shit, life is shit
The world is shit, the world is shit
This is life as I know it
This is life as I know it
This is life as I know it
This is life as I know it
This is life as I know it

The Dead Milkmen,"Sometimes I smell like a barrel of rotting fruit
Stinking up the jungle under the hot tropical sun
Other times I smell like thick black swamp-water
Backed into your toilet on a warm summer day

These are a few of my many smells
Won't you come and smell me?
Won't you share my stench?
Won't you come and smell me?
Won't you share my stench?

Once I smelled just like the bathroom
After Grandma'd used it and she's been eating prunes
Other times I smell like a city garbage strike
When all the horseflies grow to 3 inches long

These are a few of my many smells
Won't you come and smell me?
Won't you share my stench?
Won't you come and smell me?
Won't you share my stench?

Sometimes I smell just like death itself
A sickening sweet smell
It can really make you ill

Was possessed by the devil

Telling her Ringo's a bum

The world is swimmin' with electric eels
Talk seriously to me brother

There are four me's living all together
Got to keep an even keel
You've got to take life serially

All the Hendrix posters going up in flames
Let's have sex without birth control
Sell our offspring to some dirty old men
Let's play Big Black at 3 AM
And tell the neighbors they can all get fucked

I felt my body jerk
The attendant did not strap me in
I'm sure that I am gonna die
This is my last roller coaster ride
This is my last roller coaster ride
This is my last ride

Down the street there's an accident
I hear that the bodies can still be seen
Let's call the sheriff a cock-sucker
See if he's read ""The Killer Inside Me""

Maybe pollute their blood line

At the daycare center run by ex-cons

The Dead Milkmen,"You know what, Stuart, I LIKE YOU. You're not like the other
People, here, in the trailer park.

Oh, don't go get me wrong. They're fine people, they're
Good Americans. But they're content to sit back, maybe
Watch a little Mork and Mindy on channel 57, maybe kick
Back a cool, Coors 16-ouncer. They're good, fine people,
Stuart. But they don't know ... what the queers are doing
To the soil!

You know that Jonny Wurster kid, the kid that delivers papers
In the neighborhood. He's a foreign kid. Some of the neighbors
Say he smokes crack, but I don't believe it.

Anyway, for his tenth birthday, all he wanted was a Burrow Owl.
Kept bugging his old man. ""Dad, get me a burrow owl. I'll never
Ask for anything else as long as I live."" So the guy
Breaks down and buys him a burrow owl.

Anyway, 10:30, the other night, I go out in my yard, and there's
The Wurster kid, looking up in the tree. I say, ""What are
You looking for?"" He says ""I'm looking for my burrow owl.""
I say, ""Jumping Jesus on a Pogo Stick. Everybody knows
The burrow owl lives. In a hole. In the ground. Why the hell do you
Think they call it a burrow owl, anyway?"" Now Stuart, do you
Think a kid like that is going to know what the queers are
Doing to the soil?

I first became aware of this about ten years ago, the summer
My oldest boy, Bill Jr. died. You know that carnival comes into
Town every year? Well this year they came through with a ride
Called The Mixer. The man said, ""Keep your head, and arms, inside
The Mixer at all times."" But Bill Jr, he was a DAAAREDEVIL, just
Like his old man. He was leaning out saying ""Hey everybody,
Look at me! Look at me!"" Pow! He was decapitated! They found
His head over by the snow cone concession.

A few days after that, I open up the mail. And there's a pamphlet
In there. From Pueblo, Colorado, and it's addressed to Bill, Jr.
And it's entitled, ""Do you know what the queers are doing to our
Soil?""

Now, Stuart, if you look at the soil around any large US city,
There's a big undeground homosexual population. Des Moines, Iowa,
For an example. Look at the soil around Des Moines, Stuart.
You can't build on it; you can't grow anything in it. The government
Says it's due to poor farming. But I know what's really going on,
Stuart. I know it's the queers. They're in it with the aliens.
They're building landing strips for gay Martians, I swear to
God.

You know what, Stuart, I like you. You're not like the other
People, here in this trailer park.",Stuart

Open your skull to a world that is dull
You'll find it all when you shop at the mall
People like you are not worth reprimanding
I think you need some help
I think you're way off course
Maybe you need a little breather
You should get down off your horse
Look up into the sky
Try to catch your racing thoughts
Before they burn up in the sun
Take a walk
Sit in your walking chair and breathe...
Welcome to your head
Tripping on Wonder Bread
Peer into the edge of time
See the endless light
Realize there is no time
There is only light
Feel the heat of the moment
Feel the heat of the now
Feel the heat of the beige sunshine
In the back of your mind, and breathe...

The Dead Milkmen,"She's been tripping over the flowers in her garden
The weeds are growing high
She dropped her laundry off at school
And hung her children on the clothesline to dry
She's throwing trash in her simming pool
She's pouring chlorine on her lawn
You might think she needs a pair of glasses
But, no, my friend you're wrong
She cannot see the beauty in a tree
Or in the life that it supplies
This should not strike you as a mystery
For she has dollar signs in her eyes
She's crashing her car in an intersection
She did not see the light
She's walking round and round in a shopping mall
As if she had no sight
Dreams are only clouds
That form and dissipate
The sky is a highway for metal birds
And land is real estate
She does not understand her world depends
Upon a history of lies
She walks right by all her old high school friends
For she has dollar signs in her eyes

The Dead Milkmen,"There's an old lady who washes her clothes
In the same laundromat as me
She told me of her son
And some shoes that hurt his feet
Mean little nails rose up in a bunch
And plunged into his soles
Filling his dirty socks with tiny bloody holes.
There's an old man who says that he came
>From the same town as my dad
He told me of his house and why it smelled so bad
Small furry creatures had crawled in the spaces
In between the walls
They died and they decayed
And I guess that's really all
Dead little creatures mean the end of the world
There was a man who told me a story about a conspiracy
He told me how it started
And what it meant to me
Doctors and lawyers and bankers and priests are
Controlled by UFO's
It's doctors and lawyers and the end of the world
Small furry creatures mean the end of the world
It's creatures and shoes and the end of the world
There's an old lady who washes her clothes
In the same laundromat as me
She told me of her son and some shoes

The Dead Milkmen,"He would sit in the class and dream
While the teacher lectured
Until the school bell would ring
He'd be President
Philosopher king

He was a dreamer, he was a creator
He would dream what he wished to be
He was a God, he was a creator
He fell in love with a mystery

He made up rock bands and TV stations
He invented the music
He invented the shows
He would lie on his bed at night
Spinning records on his chest while he sang

I am your God, I am your creator
But you can do what you want to do
I am your God, I am your creator
You can love me or hate me
It's up to you

Then one night
Some people landed a spaceship
In his bedroom and he got in
They took him to the land that he created
And tied him to a tree and killed him

He was their God, He was their creator
To others that created them(?)
I am your God, I am your creator
Even loved the ones who hated him

And you lose track of time
In this big scary place
Always a lot to do
But of course it's easier in your mind
In this big scary place

There's too much space
There's not enough space
In this big scary place
You can go outside
If you really want

Make sure you hide

Everything you do

Is swallowed alive
Devoured by time

They own our rugs and our flower pots
There ain't nothin' they haven't got
They own the papers and the TV's

Let me remind you
They own the talk shows
They make the rules
They own Geraldo and Donahue
They own the state, they own the church
They pick the winners on Star Search
They own the Christians, they own the Jews
They own the Moslems, Mormons, too

They put that snake in my mail box

From the littlest baby to the biggest V.I.P.

They own the drugs, they own the narcs

",The Conspiracy Song
The Dead Milkmen,"Are we not the living proof of the idiot God who placed us here
Are we not His dirty children, His unwashed sons who He holds dear

Are we not the proof that there may've been another creator
If this is the ultimate truth, it had to come out sooner or later

I've looked for the reason why we're here
I've kept on searching until it was clear
I've looked for excuses - can't find no other
We must be the product of God's kid brother

Their ivy halls are closed to us
We scrape to survive and we taste the dust
The things that we weren't meant to know
Are spoke of in places where we can't go
So don't tell me you still find it hard to believe
That we were made by a different God

Are we not the proof that there may've been another creator
Let's run to the volcano and toss a virgin in the crater

We scrape to survive and do what we must
The things that we weren't meant to know
Are spoke of in places where we can't go
So don't tell me you still find it hard to believe
That we were made by a different God

Maybe there are two Gods
A perfect God who made all those perfect people
And another God who made the rest of us
And maybe, just maybe, somewhere there's a Heavenly choir
That sings off key

Are we not the proof that there may've been another creator
We'll dodge our way through life and hope for something greater

I've looked for the reason why we're here
I've kept on searching until it was clear

",God's Kid Brother
The Dead Milkmen,"Here he comes, he's coming down the street
With his drunken wife and his kids that he beats
He's gonna tell you that life is hard
Then he'll dump his trash in your backyard

You'll here lots of talk about the racially pure
When Mr. X moves in next door
Just take a walk on the ignorant side
And you'll get to see what goes on in his mind
Just take a walk on the ignorant side
And you'll get to see through his eyes

There he goes, now he's on the lawn
With his Sans-a-belt pants and Hush Puppies on
The sky is blue and the bees are buzzin'
He must be the product of two first cousins
He's got a rifle and a low I.Q.
He doesn't close his mouth when he chews his food

Oh please, dear God, strike him dead
Aim a lightning bolt at his head
Oh please, Reverend Sun Yung Moon
Send someone to kill him soon

Oh Mohammed, prophet of Allah
Run him over with his own Impala
Oh please, kill him, Shirley MacLaine
Take a pipe and bash in his brain

Here he comes, driving around the block
Sticking pamphlets in your mailbox
Inviting your kids to aryan youth camp
Moving his ammo when his basement gets damp
Training his dog to attack your cat
Hitting your mower with a baseball bat

Here he comes into your life
With about as much charm as a Bowie knife
He'll swim in your pool when you're not home
And steal your tools and your garden gnome
Here he comes, coming down the street
With his drunken wife and his kids that be beats
",Here Comes Mr. X
The Dead Milkmen,"Start off in the womb, yeah, where it's nice and warm
Things are lookin' good, then it's time to be born
Doctor pulls you out and slaps you on the butt
And before you know it your umbilical cord is cut
Drag you from your mama, wheel you down the hall
Room full of babies, who just lie there and bawl
Lyin' in a diaper, feelin' like a fool
Things'll get much worse when it's time to go to school

You're crammed into a classroom with 30 other kids
Good you get nothing - bad you get hit
Nobody likes you and the classroom is cold
Stuck with a textbook that's 35 years old
Bullies beat you up, teacher puts you down
Sittin' in the corner don't dare make a sound
If you learn one thing, better learn to curse
'cause from now on, life gets even worse

Now that you are 30, better get a job
You will buy a house, you will buy a Saab
Get up in the morning, you will feel like dyin'
As the years go rollin' by, you will lose your mind
You were once a young man, now you're turnin' grey
Listening to people talkin' 'bout the Judgment Day

Now you've retired, goodbye to the job
And you've lost your teeth, goodbye corn-on-the-cob
Look back on your life and all the things you did
Standin' in the yard, yellin' at the kids
Now you're kickin' back, you don't have a care
Time to see the world from your Craft-matic chair

You'll move to Arizona where all the old folks go
You will vote Republican, you'll see UFO's

Then one day you die, find yourself in Hell
With the lake-o'-fire and that awful brimstone smell
You were really good, but you weren't good enough
Living ain't so easy, dying's really tough
Now look around, see how it's gonna be
Yes, my friend, you're screwed for all eternity



",How It's Gonna Be
The Dead Milkmen,"Would I be amused
Would you be impressed
That I had the power
To put a hole into your chest?
When the kids are crying
And the welfare check's been spent
Would I rob a liquor store
To get some money for the rent?

If I had a gun

Would I start smoking Marlboros?
Would I stop smoking Kents?
Would I gain some new respect?
Would I gain some confidence?
Would I suddenly go crazy
And shoot my family?
And see myself years later
On some crime show on TV

If I had a gun

Would I wear it in a holster?
Would I keep it concealed?
Would I put it on the table
Every time that I'm misdealed?
When I hear a nearby gunshot
When I'm up at night alone
Would I feel a little safer
Here in my urban home?

If I had a gun



",If I Had a Gun
The Dead Milkmen,"I saw a cigar shaped flying ship
It landed outside on my lawn
You poked your head out of a door
And said, ""Hurry up get on.""
I've never seen the sight before
The world became a shrinking ball
I asked where you were taking me
You said, ""Shut up and you will see.""

CHORUS
Waves of time they rock us back and forth
There's no telling if we'll stay on course

We raced across the galaxy
Away from all our ugliness
I felt beautiful and free
Out where the devil can't exist
I felt a burst of energy
Hot white light poured from your eyes
We sped into infinity
I felt beautiful and free

CHORUS

Now I'm no longer in my life
I've left all my friends behind
Now letters don't get past my door
I can't really read them anymore
You took me to another world
Where time ceases to hold sway
And computers contain the missing key
To life's most sacred mystery

The secret of life is no secret at all
For secrets hold death and
Lies only build walls



",The Secret of Life
The Dead Milkmen,"The world's full of danger
You do what you can
You feel like a stranger
Like Shaft in Greenland

Travel around and meet all the people
Don't be afraid to touch them lightly
Travel around and meet all the people
Speak to them so politely
Travel around and meet all the people
Work up the nerve to shake their hands
Travel around and meet all the people
See how it feels to be Shaft in Greenland

The world is your oyster
So rake in the clams
And have an adventure
Like Shaft in Greenland

Travel around and see the tundra
Don't be afraid to get out of your car
Travel around and see the tundra
A little bit of Shaft goes real far
Travel around and see the tundra
Dig for dinner in the cold, damp sand

See how it feels to be Shaft in Greenland

He was big and bad, so he traveled to Greenland
He was big and bad, so he traveled to the land of the midnight sun
He was big and bad, so he traveled to Greenland

And nobody got a tan

The world is a ghetto
A rusted tin can
So pack a stiletto
Like Shaft in Greenland

The Dead Milkmen,"I had a dream you came back to my house
You changed your mind
I had a dream you came back to my house
To spend some time

You said you'd only stay a week
You brought two cats for me to keep
And told me not to feed them tuna or they'd throw up

I fed them tuna and they threw up
For hours and hours and hours and hours
I was amazed at all the stuff
That came from those little bodies of theirs

It was puffy like a sponge
The color of the sidewalk
And it smelled like the dirty rags beneath the sink

I had a dream you came back to my house
And robbed me blind
You took my stereo, CD's, and tapes and books
You left nothing behind

I woke up and you were next to me
But I knew it was just a dream
I woke up again, you were a thousand miles away

They might not eat the same food
Or they might not want to go to the places where I want to go

Or how asinine their opinions are

And yes, finally, even the cauliflower

Waits in the garden
And everybody knows that he's praying for Stan

As the navy doctor fell asleep a tense fog? surrounded us
Brilliant lights ignite in the sky
Everyone is beautiful if not somewhat unrecognisable

Sometimes it's as simple as the stakes on a wall
Sometimes it's as hard as a renaissance lute
Stuffed animals into baby ?
You know they'll even laugh at the people we shoot

The tender young boy with the life affirming needs
Still waits in the garden
And everybody's sure that he's praying for Stan

With new arms and legs they sort the mail

The first car's full of dioxin
Enough to wipe out the state of Maine

Oh, the evil, terrible things
That I sent down those tracks
I snuck them through your town at night
Right behind your back
On our little train (x2)

The second car's just painted black
What's in it nobody knows
Though sometimes it makes a buzzing noise
And once I saw it glow

The third car carries poison gas
And the fourth car it does, too
The fifth car's filled to the breaking point
With ortho orange forty-two

Oh, the evil, terrible things
That I sent down those tracks
I snuck them through your town at night
Right behind your back
On our little train (x2)

The sixth car leaks a strange brown ooze
On to the hoboes who ride below
It caused their hair to fall out
And their fingers turned bright blue
I swear to god it's true

The seventh car carries raw sewage
You can tell just by the scent
We used to have a warning sign
But something ate right through the print

Some sort a' illegal baby food
Is what we got in car number eight
And although I've never tried it myself
The conductor says it's great

We load the bodies of dead lab animals
On to car number nine
And I swear that sometimes late at night
I can hear those critters whine

Oh, the evil, terrible things
That I sent down those tracks
I snuck them through your town at night
Right behind your back
On our little train

Both cars number ten and eleven
Carry tainted juice
And I can hear it sloshing around
From my chair in the caboose



",Train I Ride
The Dead Milkmen,"If I go to Heaven it'll probably be a slum
And all the pretty angels just might be packing guns
And if I see St. Peter will he hit me up for cash
Will I find the road to Jesus or just lose him in the trash

The Shaggs were right
You're never going to please anybody
Not in this world

If I go to Hell I might find it very dull
Like an Amway convention or an endless shopping mall
When all the innocent demons want to poke me with a fork
Or just put me in a taxi and send me to New York

Scientists proved it years ago
The Shaggs were much better than the Beatles

Maybe I'll return as an iguana
And lie upon a beach down in the Bahamas

Although ignored in their day
The Shaggs are now recognised as the geniuses they were

I just wanna know what happens when you die
Do you walk down in a hole or float up to the sky
Is it just a waste of water, when your widow cries?

Oh don't tell me you've never heard of the Shaggs?

If the atheists are right then I have no need to worry
For there is no great being whose favour I must curry
And I'll be going nowhere once they lay me in the earth
So why waste a Sunday by going to church?

If you really wanted to
You could run out right now and buy a Shaggs record

If the atheists are wrong then I've got a bill that's due
So should I be a Christian or a Moslem or a Jew
Should I spend all day just praying on my knees
And searching through the world for a deity to please

A Shaggs record would be a sound investment

If the atheists are right then I have no need to worry
For there is no great being whose favour I must curry

The fat peoples want what the skinny peoples got
The skinny peoples want what the fat peoples got
But all I've ever wanted is what the Shaggs got
Dat Ding(?) and my pal, Foot Foot



",When I Get to Heaven
The Dead Milkmen,"Life sucks, then you die
And your soul gets sucked into the sky
Birds sing, I wonder why
You eat a bowl of cereal and sigh

You're late for your class
You're walkin' the halls without a pass

Big deal
Big deal

Time flies, time crawls
You're a prisoner trapped between its claws
Life sucks, sometimes
You gotta learn to live between the lines

Your feet are on the ground
But the world keeps spinning you around

Big deal
Big deal

Don't be worried, don't be down
I'll be your stupid happy clown
Keep your chin up in the air
Shake your body like you just don't care

Birds sing, babies cry
Life sucks and then you die

The Dead Milkmen,"We can stand naked on the corner of Main Street, baby, and
Let everybody slow down and take a look
You can drive your Cadillac to the library, baby, and maybe read the
Last ten pages of an Agatha Christie book
You can feed my cat to my dog
And turn around and feed my dog to my horse
You can screw the whole damn royal family, baby, until they
All get a divorce

Baby, baby, baby
Baby, you can do anything you want to do, baby
I swear it will not bother me

Baby, you know you've got to
You've got to
You've got to be what you're going to be

You can burn down the orphanage, baby, over there on the
Poor side of town
You can go to the circus, baby, frighten the elephants
See if you can get them to maybe,
Trample a clown
You can steal the prize out of my box of cereal, baby, and
Replace it with a rat
You can walk up to someone who might be a little overweight
And be kinda sensitive about it and say
""Oh my god, you're really fat!""

Live and let live, baby
That's the cornerstone
The very essence of my philosophy
And baby
Baby, you know
You know you've got to

You've got to be what you're going to be

I'm gonna play my harmonica
Since i charge $35 a note I'm not gonna play much of my harmonica
You see the blues
The blues isn't an art form
It's not a type of music
The blues is a product
Not unlike computer chips or tampons
The blues is a way for white kids to feel
That they understand the feelings of black people
Without ever having to meet any of them
The blues is all these things and more
Available for $19.95

Oh, baby
Baby, you can do whatever you want to do, baby
Baby, you know it's not going to bother me
Cause baby you know
You know you've got to
You've got to be what you're going to be

Here comes the solo!
Ooh, and what a solo it is
You know
That might not be the blues but it sure makes me sad

Listen, in the distance
The sound of Leadbelly rolling in his grave

I've said it before, baby
I'll say it again
Live and let live
The very essence, the cornerstone
The summit of my philosophy
Baby, baby, you know
Baby, you know you've got to
You've got to be what you're going to be

A blues man needs a nickname
And everybody calls me Two Shoes
Cause i always wear two shoes
I know it's not much of a nickname
But by the time i got around to getting my nickname
All the good ones were taken
Take for example Blind Lemon Lipschitz
Blind Lemon Lipschitz gouged out his own eyes with his thumbnails
So he could be called blind lemon
It's true, don't laugh
He felt the very essence of the blues, calling him from within
And he felt that contract too

Oh, baby
Baby, you know
Baby, you know you can do whatever you do
I don't care
I don't give a damn, baby
It's not gonna bother me
Cause baby, baby, be	-be	-be	-be	-be	-be	-be

The Dead Milkmen,"The girl with the strong arm has saved world cinema
Saved it from itself I like to think
The girl with the strong arm restores old paintings
Including one she found under the sink

The girl with the strong arm killed an innocent bystander
That leaves you with a mental picture
The girl with the strong arm drank straight whiskey
But I understand that she will still quotes scriptures

All poor gardeners pooled their resources
During the week long festival
Kneeling down to think about the future
Racing you would be quite dull

After many years of exodus
The hatchery fish run in rich rivers
I'm afraid the memories regarding Nixon
Are a little scary

The girl with the strong arm threatens the Quakers
They all say she's mad you know
The girl with the strong arm has an abrasive accent
She uses words like Eskimo

The girl with the strong arm stands beside a woman
Whose many parts add up to one
The girl with the strong arm makes political commentary
And yet I feel that it's all in fun

In your nightmares rub around
Those gay white males line up at church
Drink their coffee pretend to be a cowboy
Set aside an hour to search

Pulling up leaves like little Russian problems
Is now the tasty thing to do
The unattractive [Incomprehensible] cloying sweetness is you

The most popular sidearm with Canadian woodsmen
Is the blue steel woodchuck gun
Manufactured in Atlanta, Georgia
By the firm of Youse and Son

I find no fault with the two young lovers
Who dine all night on the candied eels
Then dance till dawn to a big band music
And the sound of baboon squeals

All last night I stared at jelly
Till I knew love was all around
Traveling through O'Hare airport
Dressed like a circus clown

The girl with the strong arm has started licking batteries
And that's kinda strange even for her
The girl with the strong arm would like to be a banker
But I don't think she's really sure

Using strings just to pull things over
Really keeps the party going
I'm not sure but the history of Denmark
Maybe the only thing worth knowing

Has it ever dawned on you
That car accidents just might be art
And all those kids in the foster care
Just don't think you're very smart

Down by the gunner on mother's day
In a state of perpetual bliss
Stands the man with the lisp

The Dead Milkmen,"Tuesday, yes, it was Tuesday
When I saw my congressman coming out of the titty bar
He didn't look like my congressman but that's okay
Nobody really looks like themselves anymore

I think it's got something to do with that crap
They've been pouring into the water
I decided it might be wise to follow the congressman
Just to see what he was up to

After all, my tax dollars do pay his salary
The congressman got into a taxi, so I hailed a taxi
Despite the obvious dangers involved
And the colored voices in my head began to sing

All I gotta do is put my ear to the wall
And I can hear it all, yes, I can hear it all
All I gotta do is put my ear to the wall
And I can even hear the little insects crawl

The congressman was in taxi number 23
And I was in cab 17
But numbers are meaningless
In this kind of cat and squid game

My driver was an Aries
And he laughed when I said, ""Follow that cab""
And he kept laughing
Until he saw the cold blue steel of Little Elvis

""Keep your god-damn hands off that radio"", I warned him
""I work for the government""
This is actually a half truth
I'm really a bike courier

But I make a lot of deliveries
To government offices
That's where I heard about the cheese
And the colored voices in my head kept singing

All I gotta do is put my ear to the wall
And I can hear it all, yes, I can hear it all
All I gotta do is put my ear to the wall
And I can even hear the little insects crawl

There's this super secret government program called
""Operation the cheese stands alone""
It's the congressmen's pet project
They claim that they're giving surplus cheese to the needy

I, of course, have my suspicions
After 15 very quiet minutes
The congressman's cab pulled up outside a warehouse
I had the Aries circle around the building and drop me off

He seemed to be grasping the importance of my mission
Since he said I didn't have to pay him
As long as I promised to stay very far away from him and his taxi
I swear, some people just don't want to get involved

All I gotta do is put my ear to the wall
And I can hear it all, yes, I can hear it all
All I gotta do is put my ear to the wall
And I can even hear the little insects crawl

So I walked into that cold dark place
Little Elvis drawn and ready for action
I too was ready, ready for the moment
When I would be a real American

All I gotta do is bang my head on the wall
And I can have it all, yes, I can have it all
All I gotta do is bang my head on the wall
And I can even make the little insects crawl

All I gotta do is bang my head on the wall
And I can have it all, yes, I can have it all
All I gotta do is bang my head on the wall
And I can even make the little insects crawl

All I gotta do is bang my head on the wall
And I can have it all, yes, I can have it all
All I gotta do is bang my head on the wall
And I can even make the little insects crawl

Get it fuckin' drunk when it's learning how to walk.

Tell it that the boogie man will clobber it to death.
Don't let it take a shower so its friends will not come near,

The ever endless sea
Not a drop of blue or white
Is where it shouldn't be
I'm a wheel going round
In a mirror house
I made no way out
But you have feels about
Holding on
To everything has come and gone
I need distraction
Gimme up from in between
Everything I've ever seen
Don't be long
I'm no beginner
I'll be here every night
My name up in lights

The impossible winner

I am the wilderness
Dark end of the street
Coast of infinity
Far as I can see
I'm a white noise, son
Thorn upon a thorn
But when that whips around
No part of any storm

Drag my body down the road
Drag me up to the air

I lost my will to reason so long ago
You are as broken as the ghost that you believe in
I seen him in you, you know

Listen to me when I tell you what you mean to me
Just to clear the air, the air around you is killing me
Oh, whatever's in between you and me and the vicinity
It isn't fair to me so leave and don't come back to me

Oh, you lose the right
Oh, you lose the right

When your mind goes straight to hell, you lose the right
To tell anybody what to do
Your fire licks the sky just to blind
Whoever happens to come close enough to you

The Dead Weather,"The cold white flamingo wins at black market bingo
That we used to play, but we don't play no more
We used to travel playing hotel games
Eating truck stop dinners with Christian names
Pointing out porn in payphones pinned into the core
Now I just count mile markers between your door and my door

Big boys, bad girls
Grind their teeth in stereo
Big boys, bad girls
Grind their teeth in stereo

I creep, I don't move in the breeze like I used to
I bend backwards at the elbows and the knees
The silver tap is spewing crap and I'm halfway 'round the world
Flatlined in a space between my teeth

I churned my milk and honey, I lost track of all the money
My family rescued some other stray dog
When it rains, I open windows, I just lay there
I just lay getting waterlogged, trying to get along

To have my fortune read
I didn't what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head

Said she'd take a look at my palm
Said ""Son, do you feel kind of warm?""
And she looked into her crystal ball
Said ""You're in love""

Said it could not be so
Not with all the girls I know
Said when the next one arrives
Looking into her eyes

I left there in a hurry
Much to my big surprise
The next thing I discovered
The fortune teller told me lies

So I ran back to that woman
Mad as I could be
Told her I didn't see nobody
