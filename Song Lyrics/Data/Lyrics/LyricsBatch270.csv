Nigga get it in the slump if you know how
In the heart of the summer we need a snow plow
What you know about that baby it's yo time
Coke trans-actions on the phone we call it ""blow jobs""
Too fast for the feds to cocky for the cops 
Had to ditch my old bitch gettin' sloppy with the pots (bitch)
Hoppin' off the boat meetin' poppy at the docks
He tell me i'm gaining weight, 
I tell him I'm gettin' paid, yeah
Money over bitches I'm yellin' it to the grave
Developed at a young age, go after what pays
These Gabanna sunshades block the sun-rays
I drop a car note in the mall on the first day
I gotta get it even if it's in the worst way 
That cake like it's it's my birthday

I'm so vein it's a problem 
There ain't a stain on these Pradas, I'm just being modest 
Got me a goddess, show her how to divide it, 
She still down there she don't get none of the profit 
Where around the city, let the tints hide me 
That's a cold motherfucker, whoever that's inside it 
Forever symbolizin' the grind it don't walk to you 
I'm make it' run like horses do,  
Giddy up baby if he got it then hit em' up baby 
I know its crazy but I cant get enough baby 
I love it I fuckin' love it 
I'm a self-made-millionaire fuck the public 
Ridin' to myself cause I don't fuck with nothin'

Lil' Wil,"Walk up on the set, steppin' with the swag
Clothes got a dro odor so you know I blow bats
Fresher than a motherfucker, pockets got stacks
Hoes lookin' over here 'cause they like Ski Jack

Chirper goin' off like I got a dispatch
Could be lookin' for that work and I ain't about to holla back
Post up on the whip and start lookin' for somethin' bad
Nice thighs, cute face and gotta have a fat ass

Bust that pussy open then I tell her bring it back
I'm a beast up in these sheets, it's like somethin' you never had
Caught you at the club doin' that sexy ass dance
Dropped it down to the floor and bought it back up in a stance, got damn

I like the way she workin' it
Ass sit right and it's like magic when she twerkin' it
Baby, don't you jerk me, I know this is for certain
'Cause it's guaranteed, she let me beat then I'll murk it

My dougie, my dougie, my dougie, my dougie
My dougie, my dougie, my dougie
She say she like my dougie, I'm fresh, my dougie, I'm fresh
My dougie, I'm fresh, yep, flyer than a motherfucker

My dougie, my dougie, my dougie, my dougie
My dougie, my dougie, my dougie
She say she like my dougie, I'm fresh, my dougie, I'm fresh
My dougie, I'm fresh, yep, flyer than a motherfucker

Just gotta fade, dressed to impress
Bone got a shoe fetish, so you know I stay fresh
I ain't worried about that mess a couple grand up on my chest
Plus drew then bought a tick and I stay fresher than some sess

Don't want my shoes to get no specks
Don't want no bitch to touch my neck
I'll tear this club up, if I feel some disrespect
I just wanna find a chick 'cause lil Wil just popped an x
And I don't wanna work hard 'cause I'm feenin' for some sex

Do my dougie fresh and watch them hoes get to choosin'
Middle of the club, jammin' hard to my music
Bet you can't do me like a triple x movie
Pull that dick up out ya pussy let it slap there on ya booty

Goin' hard in the jacuzzi, oh my god I like a [incomprehensible]
Stars still pursuin' 'cause I get a thing of boozey
Don't know what I'm doin' better check me out fully
Mix that dougie fresh with that north side boogie

My dougie, my dougie, my dougie, my dougie
My dougie, my dougie, my dougie
She say she like my dougie, I'm fresh, my dougie, I'm fresh
My dougie, I'm fresh, yep, flyer than a motherfucker

My dougie, my dougie, my dougie, my dougie
My dougie, my dougie, my dougie
She say she like my dougie, I'm fresh, my dougie, I'm fresh

You find da world

You look at the sun
And you see a light
You look into my eyes
Then you'll find me mind!

Yeaaaaaaaaaaah hey!
You make me crazy!!

Oh it's so cold
When rain falls
Got stupid brain
When I'm on da train
I was stupid child
And I'm still stupid now
My head hit da ball
And da ball hit da ground

Yeaaaaaaaaaaah hey!
You make me crazy!!

Get up I'm ready !
Get up there!
Cum on alone!
Get up won't you get up and down?
Stop!

Lil' Zane,"[Chorus: repeat 4X]
Such a beautiful feeling

[Lil' Zane]
I know a lot of times, it seems like it gets hard.  
But you gotta always keep faith, and always look forward.  
You never know what the future might bring. 
You never know what's ahead.

[Lil' Zane]
You got the attention of all the fellas so the chickens are jealous
They at your toes when it rains tryin to hold you umbrella
The new meat in town, all the niggas wonna get down
When getting no play they frown, 
you on they bad side, they callin you bitch now
Sophomore year, two years to go
All you tryin to do is get your first car, and make doe
Got a part time job, and the man callin your bluff
Always out to cheat us if you love wasn't enough
Problems in the home, daddy dearest done turned abusive
He got your moms scared, so thoughts are skippin out are useless
How can you get them grades, when you can't keep your focus
16 and getting hit this drunk nigga think he Joseph
Givin you black eyes so in school you wearin glasses
Friends ask what happin but believe behind your back they laughin
You show no worry but the pain don't hide
Baby girl wipe your eyes, I'm here so don't cry
And it's

[Chorus]

[Lil' Zane]
You turn no fire till you lies, tellin me I was safe
I can't take it no longer father open the gate
I seen all I can take, child killin's and rape
The same niggas that I used to love was showin' me hate
My harts lyrics and my spirits through you body and soul
Makin you feel the way I felt when these rhymes was wrote
My antidote a little weed smoke, time and thought
Makin me come up wit that raw shit, hurttin your hart
I know you feel me cause you know things I'm sayin is true
Now would I lie to you, about my life and what I been through
Tell me have you ever lost a best friend, to drugs and gats
Had to tell his mother knowin she would have an attack
Sorry lady but your son and I was runnin the block
Ran up in the wrong neighborhood, flossin our knots
Actin folish when we should have been home in the bed
Restin instead, Tony took two to the head
He never made it

[Chorus]

[Lil' Zane]
I went hot summers and cold winters, wit no dinner and-a
Freezer full of ice ain't nothin nice
And I never cream in my life, so when I did get it
I had to work and run wit it, have fun wit it
High speeds in 740's, niggas starin' hard
Mini battles and war stories, bitches love my scares
Sweatin Kev' cause he payed, and plus he from the yard
No superstars, livin gods, is what we are
Town to town, dick em' down, that's how we do it baby
Under covers we wear rubbers cause catchin AIDs is crazy
I do the unbeliveable and talk the sweatest game
And see more doe then snipes on the money train
Me bein broke is the funniest joke
That's like a nigga tellin me I stole a song he wrote
And I ain't tryin to get caught up in all that madness, life is good
Young world follow me, lets get up out the hood

Chorus",Beautiful Feelin'
Lil' Zane,"[Lil' Zane]
What will it take for you to notice me; it's like I'm not here
Do you see us can you see us down here
We have a bad habit of lookin over people
But this time I'm gon' die famous and everybody gon' know

[Verse 1]
I'm just a skinny nigga tryin to get bigger and grow stronger
and the lust to live plush and can't wait no longer
sick of seein moms workin comin home back hurtin
Cryin on my shoulder 'cause the job's workin her over
On time everyday but the boss won't promote her
He's racist she say and assaultin in some way
Gon' see him on his off day, gon' let him know
You fucks wit moms no mo' when I drive the 44
When the headlines read, ""Boy's Last Heart Was His Mind For Greed""
And he'll probably get the chair if good reason ain't there
tell the judge my excuses for the crimes I've committed 
I was high when I did it
Worked a pound of Jay's herb, in the heat of the night
my mind clicked up on some other shit, something ain't right
met in the parking lot
he was comin out his parking spot
Bet nobody see it out there, it stay dark a lot
Went for the handle but the door was locked
At the same time cockin the glock kickin the car door
maybe not hold up, wait a minute
this rap game just got in it
and plus game I'm sayin two times
the world'll be mine

[Chorus: Lil' Zane]
Gonna be famous, hard to be nameless
Niggas gotta die to be famous
If I die famous, hard to explain this 
I live a life to die famous

[Verse 2]
hustle money by Bloods, Crips, and drug dealers
It's all love wit us but disrespect, you catch slugs nigga
I hang wit cutthroat niggas that'll choke yo niggas
Tie you up and rope yo niggas for rap or for dope baby
when I was young couldn't picture bein broke baby
then fuckin wit them dope boys
had me low crazy
you know it's crucial when I'm sellin to my folk figure
dope fiends mixed genes
Papa was a rolling stone and I ain't grown
Left this lil nigga all alone, now a nigga grown
Genetic game that you passed on
Guess how many niggas I've passed gone, niggas in the system now
Ho's wantin me to hit it, but I'm dissin now
They got me wild, I know it's foul
but respect my lifestyle, it isn't fair
Before I'm legal I'll be a millionaire

chorus 2X's

[Verse 3]
Woke up this morning and saw the news flash, special report
the judge gave a nigga life 'cause the boy shot up the court
witness we die for niggas
pullin triggas for a livin 
and we takin any and everything that we wasn't given
'cause hard times, keep a nigga keep writin hard rhymes
stash 9's run up in a nigga ain't scared to squeeze mines
freeze time, when I stop your heart
'cause the slugs that i'm spittin is the spot that could stop
I die famous, you be the nigga I shot
but still nameless, 'cause they can't figure the plot
my crew stainless, and we ain't hailin no pot 
and ain't nobody gettin bigger than the niggas we got
we worldwide, but we ride for a nation of thugs
we burnin heaters if you cheat us
dudes workin the slugs
And get the sex baby 'cause I'm addicted to fame
You make me bust just by screamin my name
and when I die I die famous

[Chorus]

(Yes!)

[Chorus]

(Why do we have to die)

[Chorus]

(I know a lot of times.. we go unnoticed)
(They act like they don't love us)
(But I love you that's all that counts)

[Chorus]

(We love you that's all that counts)
(It's hard to explain why we die famous)
(But we do it baby)
(C'mon)

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

(Boy we gotta get noticed)
(We go to school but you don't see that)
(We live but you don't see that)
(This is how we know)
(This is you'll see)

Young world baby
We tired of goin unnamed 
We tired of goin unnoticed
We've lived in the ghetto for years now
We movin to the hills nigga
c'mon
Bringin wood to the hood
y'all know what it is
Young world
I put my life on the line for y'all
I love y'all
It don't matter how hard it get
Know matter how hard you try, you keep tryin nigga
Nigga the world is yours",Die Famous
Lil' Zane,"Money is mandatory, my game is self explanatory
I hit the blunt as I proceed to tell my ghetto stories
I'm into deep, all my peeps, bring them shovel stories
Some niggas strapped with their guts, trying to kill your homes
Didn't know me, but met the heat when they ran up on me
Left his wife and two kids at the crib lonely
Got in the way of a stray bullet when I pass
Trying to retaliate on beef that happened in the past
Ways of the world, how will I last when the economy crash
I'm going all out getting my cash
While spend mine open, with my eyes on the world
Ghettos and jail cells gave me stories to tell
Body swells from the evil smells that I inhale
Evil set me up to fail make my life so real
People tape will caution times being 
Lost my soul series to scar
I'm fighting demons off, it's the ways of the world

Even though it hurts chest
I'm gonna spark 'till I lose my breath
Living in sin since life began
Coming all the way out the water to get oxygen
Please father help me breathe again, at ease again

Even though it hurts chest
I'm gonna spark 'till I lose my breath
Living in sin since life began
Coming all the way out the water to get oxygen
Please father help me breathe again, at ease again

Looking at my self in the mirror, I took a second to think
Memories of being babies, given milk to drink
Without a worry at mind, we would play all the time
Name calling and b-balling took up most of our time
We were hard headed they all said it
From my parents to our teachers and even 
Preachers couldn't reach us
I say my prayers, I gave my momma 
Grey hairs she lives in fear
The thought of me not being there got her worried scared
They say I look just like my father, without the beard
They should have named that nigga magic he disappeared
A couple months out of the year, he reappears
Its all the same, ain't nothing changed, you still my nigga
Don't hold a grudge, just give me love, I'm on my own
I'm kinda sober from a broken home
Wondering what's going on, did I deserve this
Living in Atlanta got this little nigga nervous
Mama tried to feed us all, until she got laid off
Had the rats paid off, now we all laid off

Even though it hurts chest
I'm gonna spark 'till I lose my breath
Living in sin since life began
Coming all the way out the water to get oxygen
Please father help me breathe again, at ease again

Even though it hurts chest
I'm gonna spark 'till I lose my breath
Living in sin since life began
Coming all the way out the water to get oxygen
Please father help me breathe again, at ease again

Ducking the gun shots, at the age of thirteen
There was a war zone, so you choose your team
When the war strikes you better have a heart to fight
Or get lost in the world when you loose your life
I would like to get blown, so I read and pray
Surviving day to day, running the streets of stray
Living all my self no company
You better meet the heat when you come for me
And when I die, burn alive, that's a wish of mine
I know that heaving in the zone ain't that hard to find
And when you make it they gone take it, that's a must you know
Don't think of getting to the top without a problem or so
I take for precaution as for evil gotta hit on me
I've been a bad boy for momma, don't you quit on me
They built a jail so when we rise they can crush our dreams
Two of the largest in the industry, erased from the scene
And I don't wanna be a target so I got with a team
They got a glow around their body and do shit you've never seen,
Know what I mean?
Take it deep like submarines, that's what we do, only humans
Trying to get through the world with no confusion

When you close your eyes, can you state the pain, the misery
Bringing for you will rescue me
These are the ways of the world
Now I have to choose between life or lose my sanity
Go with the streets keep calling me
These are the ways of the world",Ways of the World
Lil' Zane,"Hey yo. This joint right here,

I see you baby, and I want to know, what must I do?

[Lil' Zane]
What can I do to make you see that
You want a hot boy baby I'll be that

Never tried to find you
But now I know I need you to combine with
Help me raise mine with
I need a lady in my life when the streets is rough
So come on baby let me put ya heart in handcuffs
Won't stop even when you tellin me it's enough
Can't drop till I'm feelin that I'm killin ya stuff

Make ya blush when ya hit my plush bedroom floor
Nobody sittin baby

What must I do? (Please tell me)

(Keep you iced out, spend nights out, baby I'll put ya lights out)

[Lil' Zane]
I know ya man ain't blind it ain't hard to see
Blew his mind when he saw you in the car with me
And my girl ain't blind 'cause she ask and want to see
Who is that wit you when I passed the hummer
I said nobody but she smelled yo' body
Wit you bout a hour ago
Should a listened when you told me take a shower though
If I was her man she'd even take half my dough
But I'm not
So hop up in the drop we can cruise the block
And got a spot where them niggas don't go
On the low shorty pop 'dro
But she don't let guys know
By the time we left, her eyes low
Let's do it in the parking lot
Baby I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
Already comin' out my shirt 'cause it's awfully hot
Got down to everything but my jewels and socks

Chorus

[Lil' Zane]
Last week I met this girl
My nigga she drove me crazy
Damn, she bad as hell
Even let her push my Mercedes
I hear she got a man
But he ain't beatin it crazy
That's why she came to Z
'cause I treat her like a lady
Took her up out the hood
Flossin' hard in fancy cars
By my side at the awards
Lookin' badder than the stars
Chickens was getting jealous
And players was lookin' mad
Of course, could have been my Porsche
But mami was kinda bad
Hold up, am I startin to catch feelings that I never had
And if I get serious will my niggas laugh
She like 25, I ain't even 20 yet
Diggin with her, gotta show her how my money stretch
She got drops that she ain't drove yet
She buyin' furs and it ain't even cold yet
Gimme anything I need, shorty gon' go get
I got platinum and I ain't even old yet

If its not nuthin
Girl its gotta be somethin
Slippin fallin slippin 
You must really love me

[Lil' Zane]
Told so many lies 
By so many different guys
Its hard to see the truth when in front of your eyes
I'm from a city of conflicts
Criminals and convicts
Livin on the run baby 
Only havin fun baby
She was just a friend so I never dug her
A young thug and so it wasn't in my heart to love her
You say you love me regardless 
You was young and I was heartless
We both said it
I was hard headed
Everything you said went into a ear and out another
I couldn't understand you wanted me to be your lover
You took time every night to write me love letters
And you used to whisper in my ear nobody does it better
And did I mention it was long letters
I like they way you squeeze in them dungaries
But the thongs betta
And you believe that I'm not there
Till it make it feel like if you leave then I won't care
Yeah

[chorus]

[Lil' Zane]
All my life I been goin through depression
More of the love and less dressin
I'm tired of guessin
Tell me if you want affection
You make a thug feel love
You head rushin
And I can't seem to get enough 
Can I touch somethin?
You're like an angle wit some wings sent to guide me
The law try to lock me down but you hide me
Be beside me strapped for war soldier guide me
I'm tryin to be wit you 
ain't a army that can stop me
Told me team the dream and automatically they knock me
Said ya beat me down cause I'm young I'm like ""watch me""
I love winnin, ice linen and keep my dubbs spinnin 
Love women, street corners and I'm gone keep on bendin
Wit you its no pretendin 
And even at the beginin I knew that you was wit it
Even tho I neva hit it
Forgive me for the times I bullshitted
And now I'm all yours
Baby you did it

Donde he nacido

Quisiera morir

Ahora que lejos

Yo vivo sin luz
Sin amor
Y al verme
Tan sola y triste

Cual hoja el viento
Quisiera llorar
Quisiera morir

Because you smell like the armadillo

You know why I always remember you
You know why I can't forget you

She huddles in a doorway 
To dream her hunger gone 
Forgotten by the cold world 
Frightened by her own 
She sips a little whiskey 
To forget she is alone 

She's waiting for a rain of angels 
To lift her from the shadows 
To give her back her name 
Turn back all the pages 
Give her shelter from the storm 
She's waiting for a rain of angels 

And all the places where the battle lines are drawn 
When the bullets fly 
It doesn't matter what side you're standing on 
Give the farmer back his land 
Pull the helpless from the street 
Take the guns out of our hands 
And we will be within the angel's reach 

Call down through the ages 
Wash away the pain 
Only love will remain 
We're all waiting for 
Still waiting for a rain of angels 

Waiting for a rain of angels 
Waiting for a rain of angels 
Waiting for a rain of angels

Lila McCann,"I'm a restless girl 
That's right 
And I'm gonna be free 'til the day I die 
I can't hang around 
This one horse town 
I want to fly like an eagle flies 
And I won't give up 
'Cause I've gone too far 
I'm gonna circle the wagons 
'Round my lucky star 

Gonna saddle my dreams and away I'll fly 
Baby wishes have wings and so do I 
I want to ride like the wind 'til the sun sinks low 
Saddle my dreams wherever I go 

By the harvest moon 
I'll be on my way 
Into the arms of a no-man's land 
And I won't settle down 
And I won't give in 
'Cause I'll pick myself back up and do it over again 
'Cause I want your love 
Gonna take my shot 
And I won't give in 'til I get what I want 

Gonna saddle my dreams and away I'll fly 
Baby wishes have wings and so do I 
I want to ride like the wind 'til the sun sinks low 
Saddle my dreams wherever I go 

I want the wind in my hair 
The sun on my face 
Gonna spread my soul around 
All over the place 
Gonna stick to my guns 
No I ain't gonna change 
'Til I find my perfect little home on the range

Lila McCann,"Hey pretty boy whatcha pullin' on me 
Ya think you got it all wrapped up 
Lyin' in the shade of the sycamore tree 
Sorry but it just ain't enough 
You gotta do better than talk the big talk 
Or an occasional courtesy call 
I ain't seen roses and I ain't seen a thing 
Of what love's got to do with it all 

If you want to steal a kiss 
Then you've gotta steal a piece of my heart 
You're a pretty little boy but a fumblin' fool 
If you're goin' for a tumble in the dark 

My oh my have you got a lot to learn 
You've got to wrap me up in romance 
Before you crash and burn 
And if you never call me to blow my heart away 
Yippy ky yay 
(Yippy yippy yippy yippy yippy ky yay 
Yippy yippy yippy ky yo 
You want to dance to the rhythm of a country girl 
Boy you got a long way to go) 

Would it hurt so much to open my door 
Or send me a flower or two 
Cause I believe in love like the good book says 
Not the gospel according to you 
You can't two-step around step number one 
And then skip down to three and four 
You can't touch me with a ten-foot pole 
'Til you back off a little bit more 

If you want to steal a kiss 
Then you've gotta steal a piece of my heart 
You're a pretty little boy but a fumblin' fool

(You want to dance to the rhythm of a country girl) 
(Boy you got a long way to go) 

I know what you want 
And there are times I want it too 
But I'm lookin' for a gentleman 
Who knows just what to do 
And I can take the boots and jeans 
And even your beat-up Cadillac 
But when it comes to what a woman needs 
You ain't no Cary Grant 

Hey, hey, oh 

My oh my have you got a lot to learn 
You've got to wrap me up in romance 
Before you crash and burn

Let's make it clear just so there's no confusion

Lila McCann,"We didn't know what hit us
We had to stop and catch a breath

You'd have thought we could've seen it coming

I guess that's the way it is
If you've never been

Looking back is easy
If you've got memories like ours
We crashed like two headlights
And we're still seeing stars

Lila McCann,"Caught in the downpour of a rain of stones
Felt like an exile in the world I had known
So I sought the shelter of my own soul and stayed inside
Words that were sharper than the winter wind

No longer had the power to pierce my skin
And they may not stop but I won't take them in
And I won't hide

I will be here
I will be strong
I'll face my fears when the night is long
And still go on

I will be brave
I will be bold
Follow my faith to a higher road
And I'm not there yet
But I will be

I could choose to keep my feet upon the narrow path
And never cross the open field for that one snake in the grass
But I'd rather risk my heart than never get the chance
To find my way

I will be here
I will be strong
I'll face my fears when the night is long
And still go on

I will be brave

Kiss me now, cause you know you will 
Kiss me now, why wait until 
The end of the night when it's awkward and shy 
And there's so much at stake that we're scared to try

Kiss me now, get it over with 
I'll make it easy on you 
I want you to 
Kiss me now

It makes it hard to talk 
This ice is easily broken

Counting minutes as they pass
Searching for a sign
Wishing for the best

You turned my heart to love again

You rescued me like the angels do
You shook the heavens and cracked the sky
When you walked
When you walked into my life

When you appeard like sight to the blind
Like music to my hears
Like reason to a rhyme
And just when I thought my chance was gone

Way out of touch  if I'm not 
crazy then baby this must be love 

I would go anywhere 
Do anything  no I don't care 
Long as I know 
I'll always go...with you

Went and proved me wrong
I find myself speechless

Is so strong
And I was convinced that my heart had reached its limit
Until you created this new place in it

Your touch wraps around me
In love it knows no boundaries now
There's nothing I wouldn't do for you
You're the answer I've been needing
Life has a whole new meaning now

Everything's different
There's no frame of reference
For the way I feel

Will over analyze

I get the feeling that this feeling be real

Can you feel too?

So fast I can't let go

Lila McCann,"When her grand kids comes to visit her 
Sometimes she forgets their names
Her memory is selective now
Small details just fade away
She looks out the windows with a vacant stare
She can't remember what she's doing there

But she remembers love
The blue in his eyes
Hot summer nights
It's like she's memorized his every touch
And how he swept her heart away
Like it was yesterday
She remembers love

On her dresser there's a special box
Where she keeps a fade flower
From a wild field where they made love
And woke each others first desire
The passion never died for sixty years
And since she's lost him, some things haven't been so clear

Oh no, there ain't no easy way
No deed that you can do
no magic prayer that you can pray
Oh yeah, time is what it takes
To make a heart start bending 
Where it used to break

It was wishful thinking
Thinking I'd be alright
With a pep talk from my sister
And a couple good cries
It only got better
When I got it through my head
Ain't no getting round a heartache
Got to roll with it instead

Just put your hand in mine
And baby look deep in my eyes
And just with one breath your heart will confess
What we both know deep inside

Lili Haydn,"Will she find it, will she find
Solitary changing times
And someday she'll have her own party
Someday she'll have her own house
Someday she'll chase her own carrot
'til that day she'll live in a house with thirty people
Will we ever understand the reasons we were chosen
Obligations for the seventh day of our creation

Baby clinging, baby clings
Somber notions sweet fledgling
And someday she'll write her own credo
Someday she'll build her own house
Someday she'll choose her own leaders
Someday she'll rabble rouse
Will we ever understand the reasons we were chosen
Obligations for the seventh day of our creation

Someday she'll have her own dream
Someday she'll chase her own carrot

Someday we'll say what we mean
Someday we'll have compassion

Lili Haydn,"She rides down Fairfax with her Mommy
Canter's on the right, the night is foggy
Not foggy enough, she still sees the pain in their eyes
She makes mom explain the reason why
They live on the street, we just drive by
But not fast enough, she still sees the blame in her eyes
""Can we please take somebody home
There's room in our house where it's not cold
Why can't we please take somebody home?""
The little girl cries with love in her eyes

Mom don't make that much in a day
She knows they ain't that far away
From being denied
She barely survives in this land
""Can we please take somebody home
There's room in our house where it's not cold
Why can't we please take somebody home?""
The little girl cries with love in her eyes

Mom tries to explain ""supply side""
Not much trickles down, justice belie
The eyes of a child see through these civilized lies

There's room in our house where it's not cold
Why can't we please take somebody home?""

Lili Haydn,"I'm in too deep to turn around
All I want is your sweet loving
But when you move away from me
I feel just like I am drowning
And I know the sweetness is right before our eyes

I would do anything to be with you
Make it through to understanding
Anywhere you want me to
Talk to me, I know we'll make it through

I'm trying not to be so scared
Sometimes I don't know if you want me
When all I need is tenderness
Show me how to love somebody
And I know the sweetness is right before our eyes

I would do anything to be with you
Make it through to understanding
Anywhere you want me to
Talk to me, I know we'll make it through

And who knows what forever brings,
But I am ready for real love...",Anything

De la quebrada de Reyes
Baja a las carpas de Yala
Con setenta años que tiene

La harina del carnaval
Le pensamienta las sienes
Cuando sobre el mujerío
Su canto finito crece

Alegre como pocas
Doña Santa se amanece
El manantial de sus coplas va
Por senderos viejos
El manantial de sus coplas va
Despenando su soledad

No hay una pena de amor
Que por su boca no queme
Ni hay en la carpa baguala
Que por ella no se queje

En los ojos se le duerme
Hasta que un golpe de caja
Cantando la reverdece

Después de vivir un siglo

Ha penetrado en mi nido

Se ha paseado por mis venas

Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete
Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a Los 17

I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

I doubt myself and I've given up
On almost everything

Cry out for more when you want to close the door
Waste away. Follow through I hear you say

Every time you confront me, I'm the one who feels nothing.
...and I hate myself for what I have become
You gave me a second chance, but I threw it all away
...and everything means nothing to me now

Run forever, run away in spite of all the pain
Feed the failure, ever after
Tied to everything

Someday you've got to give it up



In between the lines you'll see

Why don't you make your dreams come true

I'll show you how

Here's what you do

Show a little love

Give a little love

All I want from you is one thing

Show your love to me



Look up to the skies

I see desire in your eyes

But you can't keep it in your heart

Let's take the night and

Then we'll sleep by candle light

While flames of love are burning

In the dark.

Now I can't tell the lies from truth

So prove me wrong

Does she feel the same?

Never saw the shadows smile

Never watched the red light warning

Said it was the way to go

Find a way to make you happy

Oh, no.



I look to you, you look to me

It's all the same, just one big game

You say it's me, I say it's you

But maybe now

When you lose control

You'll see what I could give,

Trapped inside your heart,

I'm dyin' to live.



One man without a mission

Like an eagle, flying slow

I wanted to kiss the blue sky,

But all the clouds were hanging far too low.



And then one day, I looked away,

Into the air, the Lord was there.

He broke the sky, the sun flew by,

I died for you, Shades of Blue.



But maybe now

When you lose control

You'll see what I could give,

Trapped inside your heart,

And if the moon is bright

The stars would all kiss you,

Are Shades of Blue.

Now as I walk down this winding road,
I need you to lighten the load.
Hey, now, take my hand;
I'll lead you to the Promised Land.

One cold December so long ago,
We watched the snow cling to the trees.
Your lips were so warm as you kissed my hand
We would have sailed the seven seas.
But when you walked away,
Said you could not stay,
And love lay dying like a wounded dove.
But if you come back now,
I will take your hand
And lead you to the Promised Land.

Are you feeling lonely? Do you need a friend?
Well, is the pain too much to stand?
The seeds of love are sown inside
And the memories of our lives will guide our hand.
So as you fly away
I will sing the day
And meet you in the Promised Land.

Take my hand to the Promised Land.

But when you walked away,
Said you could not stay,
And love lay bleeding like a wounded dove.
But if it needs to be
Then I will set you free.
And meet you in the Promised Land.

It lingers for a lifetime, and holds my breath in check

Did you think I would see it coming

Turn around, look at me I'm running

Now, my love

Through the years, all the pain and suffering

Children's cries, amount to nothing

Rise above



What you see is what you get

Stake your life now, place your bet

You better believe I know, I'll be letting you go.



Will you ever know what I wanted to say?

Maybe you'll find a way

Maybe I'll be alright

Remember this night and I'll see you someday.



Many nights, I listened to

The sounds that made me cry and kept

My soul awake



But even in the darkness,

I could see the endless oceans

That our tears would make.



Why'd you lay our love to rest?

Gave it up, put it to the test of time, my love

My life's just not the same

Not a question of who's to blame,

I'll rise above



Don't you know that Love is War

That's what we're living for

But sometimes they can crash into the sea.

Otherwise, you'll have no choice in living

Your life the way it's mean to be.



But one more believer is all that we need.

The scars on our knees is the proof that we bleed.

But I know, oh, I know

Where to go



Oh, 'cause she's my salvation

When the world gets oh so lonely I escape.

She's my salvation.



One lover's pain is another man's relief.

But I know, oh, I know

This feeling's got to go.



When the time is right, you'll see a new way.

The road is paved with gold and leads you home again.



Bad news most everyday,

Wonder why I run away

Got to find a sanctuary.

Find your own peace in the rules that you make.



Believin' your eyes is the first big mistake.

But I know, oh, I know

Where to go.



Oh, 'cause she's my salvation

When the world gets oh so lonely I escape.

Oh, now, she's my salvation.

One lover's pain is another man's relief.

But I know, oh, I know

This feeling's got to go.



Now she's my salvation

When the world gets oh so lonely I escape.

Oh, now she's my inspiration

Unspoken lies, another fool's belief.

But I know, oh, I know

This feeling's got to go.

She's my Salvation, She's my Salvation

She's my Salvation, She's my Salvation



The first big mistake is letting

The things around you get you down.

Find salvation in something or someone

And make that your sanctuary.



Unless you do this, you're lost.

I'd like to help you find your golden mile

Dreaming, Crying, Hoping, Trying,
Praying, Dying,
Gets you through another day

Running, Flying, Escape, Denying,
No one's trying to explain

[Chorus]
What do you want?
What do you need?
Do you enjoy watching me plead?
What do you see?
Who do you Love?
The moonlight in your blood.
What do you feel?
Who do you love?
There's moonlight in your blood.

Spend your nights inside a silk cocoon,
Butterfly,
Your soul could never die,
I see you leave us as you stare at the moon,
And you'll live again,
I only wish that I could share your pain,
What a shame.

[Chorus: x2]",Moonlight in Your Blood
Lillian Axe,"Feel like I'm loosin' again
Slipping away is the faith I used to cling to
Life seems too strange to be real
Watching you take it all in stride
Just for you
I'd take the needle and your pain
Away from you
One for you

Time has no mind for regret
Watching you bite on the bullet you were born with
How do you sit there at ease
While something inside steals your peace
Just for you
I'd take the needle and your pain
Away from you
I'd give you shelter from the rain
Just for you
One for you

No one can convince me that there's method to this madness
As I watch you fade
The hours tick away
With the courage of a lion
And the stead-fast heart of gold
You gave me strength while the flames of my hope
Burn so cold
Feeling the heat once again
Handed us hope as you rose up from the ashes
Gone is the pain so be free
Now in your name we can see

Just for you
I'd take the needle and your pain
Away from you
I'd give you shelter from the rain
Just for you
I'd take the needle and your pain
Away from you
I'd give you shelter from the rain

Lillian Axe,"Well I felt this coming on for a long, long time
When everything turns red, it's such a bad sign
Just a little bit of light would've helped me see
That every loaded gun wasn't aimed at me
Could've set me free

You made me
Betrayed me
Too many times
A jaded Delilah
Live, learn, and die

Now you know

Been livin' with my head in the deep, blue sea
So why does everyone seem so afraid of me
Just a little bit of air would've helped me breathe
When there is no such solution take your leave
Put your mind at ease

Release me just to please me, way too late
Your time was impatient, seal my fate

Now you know

You think the start of this was yesterday
Been scratchin' and clawin' just to find my way out
How could you ever let me dig so deep?

Well, now I know

It seems I've lost my mind
I'm one strange personality.
Have I gone crazy?

I feel rebellion's overdue,
So chain me up now,
You'll get what's coming to you

You can do just what you please,
Don't you know that happyness is free,
Disguised to hide the reasons,
We believe just what we see.

It's time to look beyond the real,
While you create the life you feel,
Everybody needs their time,
Scaling mountains they can't climb,
Falling down to their knees.

It's a sign of the times
Do you want to be
Just a sign of the times
It's the end of the line
Such a tragedy
It's a sign of the times

Shooting stars light up the sky
We march on prepared to die
I won't let them take my sense of pride, no,
Safe beneath the shelter,
But your face you cannot hide

It's time that people realize
What stares them right between their eyes
Everybody's wasting time,
Trying to make the world all rhyme,
It's so easy to see

Adam: Yeah, little brother, but that was then and this is now.


Read the story that I'm sure you've heard before,
Watch the signs come every day,
A turn of your back, it slips away.

In the blinking of an eye,
Taken for granted, kiss me good-bye

Make believe come true
I'll be protecting you

While we're running blind
Stop the hate, before it's too late,
We're just losing time,
Seeing colorblind
Stop the hate, one more chance before we go,

I'm so sick and tired of your complaining,
Tie your hands behind your back,
With your eyes shut, we fade to black.
Their promises are lies
And smiles behind their lying eyes
Take your money for the cause
They crush you with their vicious jaws,
What happened to integrity, with me for you
And you for me
It's all a dream so kiss your life good-bye

If wishes did come true I'd be protecting you

Lillian Axe,"I had a dream of great catastrophes
And all the children cried a thousand seas
While all the love we watched them lay to rest
We stood up straight and tall and let them
Let them put us to the test
And we won, and love have saved the day
Then I woke, and evil got away

And on your throne you condescend so well
If I could have my way you'd burn in hell
While I watched you steal the bread from open arms
As you promise to protect their lives from harm

Bow down to those who prey
For they shall have their day

Hey you, watcha gonna do to me
Down so low, can't you look around and see
There's hope, truth is gonna set you free
You don't know, meaning of equality

[Chorus: ]
Fighting to erase the dynasty
Of those who prey on me
And on your life you swear on lust and greed
But the cries of hurting children makes you bleed
Can you see your demon right before your eyes
They're no good to you, except for cheap disguise

Bow down to those who prey
For they shall have their day

Hey you, watcha gonna do to me
Down so low, can't you look around and see
There's hope, truth is gonna set you free
You don't know, meaning of equality

Then they laughed away
Sit, relax, stay calm 
Now they control me

With a fire and a body that can touch you
Even now I think I need somebody
Don't think that I could ever have my time alone

'Cause I'm a captive soul
To the voices of my walls

Fear has settled in, my room commands me
Keeps me warm inside

Lillian Axe,"First to cast the stone
I'd rather walk my miles alone
Last to take the blame
I'd rather take the hit than devastate the lame

Your eyes are blind
Your tongue is tied
Dumb to the gifts that we've received
Listen deaf ears
Strands of the march
Nothing has changed, all wasted years

Burning the home crushing the bone
Wasting the precious moments
Living to die draining the seas
Stealing the gems with hands unkept 

Jesus wept

Air too thick to breathe
I watched the demons play naïve
Blood too thick to taste
I pull the leeches from my arm so not to waste

Gorged like the pig fat like the tick
Carrying bellies set to break
High on your throne ruling alone 
Preaching commandments of your own

Leaving your home nursing the bone
Savoring precious moments
Dying to live filling the seas
Laying at the gold sheets where you slept

Jesus wept (4x)

Bleeding from holes
On my body beat and broken 
I don't give a damn
How you accumulated tokens

Leaving your home nursing the bone
Savoring precious moments
Dying to live filling the seas
Laying at the gold sheets where you slept

Jesus wept (5x)

Lillian Boutté,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep

All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me

To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
out of all the fellows in the world she belongs to me.
But it was Just my imagination,
once again runnin' away with me.
It was just my imagination runnin' away with me. Oo
 
Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country with two children maybe three.
I tell you I can visualize it all 
this couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems;
But it was Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.
 
Ev'ry night on my knees I pray Dear Lord, Hear my plea;
Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.

Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.

Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flash back warm night, almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

Sometime you pictured me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you said, ""go slow, I fall behind""

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

And darkness has turned to grey
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm ok
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

Lily & Madeleine,"If only my feet could fall as fast as a heart does
I would be so long gone
But I'm stuck, stuck under your thumb

I can't get up
I can't get up, up I can't get up
If only my eyes could see as high as a mountain
Or wherever your heart's gone
But I have fallen on the bank of this river

I can't get up
I can't get up, up I can't get up
If only my heart could speak into this river
And you'd drink me up
I could be free of all these lonesome shivers
I could give myself up (give myself up)
We all go back to the river
We will all come undone
And there you will be, my love, with the faintest touch
And I will give myself up
Give myself up, up
I will give myself up
Give myself up, up
I'll give myself up",Back to the River
Lily & Madeleine,"The river is white
It's tangled and dry
But I still remember you here
Swimming in the middle

A red bird sings
From the sycamore tree
Some kind of eloquent echo
I live in the middle

The shadows and leaves unlock my heart
Just like a key, like a key
And bring you right back home to me
All of the years I have spent here I have never wandered
I live in the middle

The way you sing unlocks my heart
Just like a key, like a key
And brings you right back home to me

The way you sing unlocks my heart
Just like a key, like a key
And brings you right back home to me
And brings you right back home to me",In the Middle

I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on

And you won't leave your house unless you're wearing your thermals

You only buy the paper just to cut out the coupons
You're saving 50p but what do you want with tampons
You're always at the doctor picking up you prescription
And they throw in some KY just to ease up the friction

You've got a leak in your colostomy bag
Yeah, it's got a hole in, hole in, hole in
On the weekend you're shopping with your trolley
It's sad how you're rollin', rollin', rollin'

Then I see its a pimp and his crack whore

She was struggling with bags from Tesco
There were people from the city havin lunch in the park
I believe that it's called AL fresco
Then a kid came along to offer a hand
But before she had time to accept it
Hits her over the head, doesn't care if she's dead
Cause he's got all her jewelery and wallet

And I remember when you started callin' me your miss's
All the play fightin', all the flirtatious disses
I'd tell you sad stories about my childhood
I don't know why I trusted you but I knew that I could
We'd spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt
I was just so happy in your boxers and your t-shirt

Dreams, dreams
Of when we had just started things
Dreams of you and me
It seems, it seems
That I can't shake those memories
I wonder if you have the same dreams too.

The littlest things that take me there
I know it sounds lame but its so true
I know its not right, but it seems unfair
The things are reminding me of you
Sometimes I wish we could just pretend
Even if for only one weekend
So come on, tell me
Is this the end?

Drinkin' tea in bed
Watching dvd's
When I discovered all your dirty grotty magazines
You take me out shopping and all we'd buy is trainers
As if we ever needed anything to entertain us
The first time that you introduced me to your friends
And you could tell that I was nervous, so you held my hand
When I was feeling down, you made that face you do
No one in the world who could replace you

Dreams, dreams
Of when we had just started things
Dreams of me and you
It seems, it seems
That I can't shake those memories
I wonder if you feel the same way too

The littlest things that take me there
I know it sounds lame but its so true
I know its not right, but it seems unfair
The things are reminding me of you

Lily Allen,"Now listen I think you and me have come to the end of our time
What d'ya want? Some kinda reaction? Well OK that's fine
Alright how'd it make you feel if I said you never made me come
In the year and a half that we spent together yeah I never really had much fun

All the times that I said I was sober, well I'm afraid I lied
I'd be lying next to you and you next to me
All the while I was high as a kite

I can see it in your face as you break it to me gentle yeah you really must think you're great
Well let's see how you feel in a couple of weeks when I work my way through your mates

I never wanted it to end up this way
You've only got yourself to blame
I'm gonna tell the world you're rubbish in bed now
And that you're small in the game

So you thought this was gonna be easy, well you're out of luck
Well let's rewind let's turn back time
To when you couldn't get it up

You know what it shoulda ended there
That's when I shoulda shown you the door
As if that weren't enough to deal with
You became premature

Sorry if ya feel that I'm being kinda mental
But you left me in such a state
Now I'm gonna do to you what you did to me
I'm gonna reciprocate",Not Big

Please don't come around and knock on my door
'Cause I don't want to have to pick you up of the floor
When you ask if we can still be lovers
I'll have to introduce my brothers
I think that they could teach you a lesson or two,
By the time they've finished you'll be black and blue
You'll be crying like a baby,
A sea of tears they'll call the navy in

You wanna take your thoughts elsewhere,
Cos you're doing in my nut,
And do you think I care?

Do what you do
Feel what you feel,
As long as it's real.
I said take what you take
And give what you give
Just be what you want,
Just as long as it's real.

Now by a horse, I once was told
That all that glitters is not gold
And all that is to fear is fear itself.
This horsey also told me,
I should keep my friends close but my enemies closer,
So as to protect myself.

Cause the filth took away my licence
It doesn't get me down and I feel okay
Cause the sights that I'm seeing are priceless

Everything seems to look as it should
But I wonder what goes on behind doors
A fella looking dapper, but he's sittin' with a slapper
Then I see its a pimp and his crack whore

You might laugh you might frown

When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
You can see its all lies

There was a little old lady, who was walkin' down the road
She was struggling with bags from Tesco
There were people from the city havin lunch in the park
I believe that it's called AL fresco
Then a kid came along to offer a hand
But before she had time to accept it
Hits her over the head, doesn't care if she's dead
Cause he's got all her jewelery and wallet

You might laugh you might frown

But she's nearly 30 now and she's out every night
I see that look in her face she's got that look in her eye
She's thinking how did I get here and wondering why

It's sad but it's true how society says
Her life is already over
There's nothing to do and there's nothing to say
Til the man of her dreams comes along picks her up and puts her over his shoulder
It seems so unlikely in this day and age

She's got an alright job but it's not a career
Wherever she thinks about it, it brings her to tears
Cause all she wants is a boyfriend
She gets one-night stands
She's thinking how did I get here
I'm doing all that I can

It's sad but it's true how society says
Her life is already over
There's nothing to do and there's nothing to say

But you made it so easy for me

I have a cigarette to pass the time
Cause the traffic's hell

I don't want anything more
Than to see your face when you open the door
You'll make me beans on toast and a nice cup of tea
And we'll get a Chinese and watch TV
Tomorrow we'll take the dog for a walk
And in the afternoon then maybe we'll talk
I'll be exhausted so I'll probably sleep
And we'll get a Chinese and watch TV

You wipe the tears from my eye
And you say that all that it takes is a phone call
I cry at the thought of being alone and then
I wonder how long it will take til I'm home again

I don't want anything more
Than to see your face when you open the door
You'll make me beans on toast and a nice cup of tea
And we'll get a Chinese and watch TV
Tomorrow we'll take the dog for a walk
And in the afternoon then maybe we'll talk
I'll be exhausted so I'll probably sleep
And we'll get a Chinese and watch TV

I know it doesn't seem so fair
But I'll send you a postcard when I get there

I don't want anything more
Than to see your face when you open the door
You'll make me beans on toast and a nice cup of tea
And we'll get a Chinese and watch TV
Tomorrow we'll take the dog for a walk
And in the afternoon then maybe we'll talk
I'll be exhausted so I'll probably sleep

Lily Allen,"I don't know much but I know this for certain
And that is the sun poking its head 'round the curtain
Now please can we leave, I'd like to go to bed now
It's not just the sun that is hurting my head now
I'm not trying to say that I'm smelling of roses
But when will we tire of putting shit up our noses
I don't like staying up, staying up past the sunlight
It's meant to be fun and this just doesn't feel right

Why can't we all, all just be honest
Admit to ourselves that everyone's on it
From grown politicians to young adolescents
Prescribing themselves anti-depressants
Now how can we start to tackle the problem
If you don't put your hands up and admit that you're on them
The kids are in danger, they're all getting habits
From what I can see everyone's at it
Everyone's at it
Everyone's at it
Everyone's at it

I get involved but I'm not advocating
Got an opinion, yeah you're well up for slating
So you've got a prescription and that makes it legal
Now find the excuses overwhelmingly feeble
You go to the doctor, you need pills for sleeping
Well if you can convince him, I guess that's not cheating
See your daughter's depressed we'll get her straight on the Prozac
But little do you know, she already takes crack

Why can't we all, all just be honest
Admit to ourselves that everyone's on it
From grown politicians to young adolescents

He'd think the things we do
Are a waste of time

Do you think he'd drive
In his car without insurance
Now is he interesting
Or do you think he'd bore us
Do you think
His favorite type of human
Is Caucasian
Do you reckon
He's ever been done
For tax evasion
Do you think he's any good
At remembering people's names
Do you think he's ever taken
Smack or cocaine
I don't imagine
He's ever been suicidal

Is Creedence Clearwater Revival

We're all going to die
Because we didn't turn the lights off
And we didn't take the bus
Even though we know we should have
Oh, silly old us
Well, we should have recycled
And saved our resources
While they're still someone else's
Someone call the armed forces
And we'll blame it on terror
Also known as religion
But we shouldn't feel guilt
For protecting our children

Excuse me, sir
But is this what they call denial
Just to carry on regardless
We'll only do it for a while
We'll carry on straight down the line
Down the road to nowhere
Do you know where it is leading us
And do we even want to go there

I don't have the answers
I don't know where we start
Start to pick up all the pieces
Of everything we've torn apart
Now, you'd think that we'd be grateful
For the fact we've got a choice
Instead we throw it back at people
Who don't even have a voice
And the teachers always told us
Told us we should love thy neighbour
And my mother always told me
Told me I should vote New Labour
But I don't know who to trust
And I just find it all confusing
All as useless as each other
Past the point of being amusing

Excuse me, sir
But is this what they call denial
Just to carry on regardless
We'll only do it for a while
We'll carry on straight down the line
Down the road to nowhere
Do you know where it is leading us
And do we even want to go there

Lily Allen,"Somebody remind me where I am
Miami or Timbuktu?
Did I ever tell you my uncle's monkey ran away from the zoo?
Would you tell me what this all means?
What happens if I go through that door?
'Cause I'm looking up at the ceiling, but it's turning into the floor

When I'm bored, I, kinda drift away,
I'm not sure, quite, why we work all day
I've been thinking, and I've got this plan

Let's go, right now

Come meet me in the sky I'll be waiting for you
And we can't hear what they say
Up in my air balloon, air balloon, air balloon (ha)
Sing, sing along, along any song you want to
Now we're so high, it can't rain
Up in my air balloon, air balloon, air balloon (ha)

I don't like dropping names but Kurt Cobain is all in my face
How the hell am I gonna tell him Elvis already took first base?
In and out of the blue this cruise is losing altitude, all we need
Is a little more elevation, take me back to where I can breathe

Lily Allen,"It seems like only yesterday you were with somebody else
Soon as it was over though I had claimed you for myself
Didn't take me long before I had moved my stuff to yours
Glad to leave the past behind and I'm glad to close the door

Because you know I love you
Because you know I love you

So far it's been so good and it seems we'll stand the test of time
You never call me ""baby"" but you refer to me as ""mine""
What I like the best is how you can keep me on my toes
Staying home with you is better than sticking things up my nose

I had that awful feeling
That I needed help
My life had lost its meaning
But you saved me from myself

As long as I got you and we can be
Together and forever just you and me
Well that's swell

You sleep with your mouth wide open and you go to the pub alone
You only cook from frozen but I don't ever hear you moan
You let me lie in bed when you're doing breakfast with the kids
Landing on my feet with you I'm so happy this is how we live

Because you know I love you
Because you know I love you

I had that awful feeling
That I needed help
My life had lost it's meaning
But you saved me from myself

As long as I got you and we can be

And when he calls, when he calls my name

I lie on the sofa watching TV
Get on the computer and start checking up on everyone else
On everyone else

Looking at all the pictures
Up to all sorts of mischief
Some of them are ridiculous
Everything's there to see

Everyone looks so wasted
Totally off their faces
I feel so isolated
Everyone there but me

Why does it feel like I'm missing something?
""Been there and done that"" was good for nothing
Everything's perfect, yeah I'm as content as can be
This is the life for me (This is the life for me, yeah)

It's a bit early for a midlife crisis

I'm not complaining but last night I hardly slept at all
But actually yes I am complaining
No energy left in me, the baby might have taken it all
'Cause I've hit the wall

Please don't think that I'm being rude
Honey I'm just not in the mood
I'm head to toe in baby food
So please will you give it a rest

It's not that I don't love you
And it's not that I don't want to
Honestly baby to tell you the truth

Took the words straight out of my mouth

Bring some fags and brings some Rizlas

I'll get back up, it's not as if I've never done this
But then again, the game is changing
Can't just come back, jump on the mic and do the same thing
There goes the bell, I know that sound

Limahl,"If that's your problem don't let it show
You will find itself decieving love can be unsure.
Keep a level head maintain'your pride
Then you can face the situation straight in the eye.
And especially when she comes on strong
When she smiles that smile that leads you on
Ny to see it through playing out your part
Making certain when you give your heart - it's
Only for love
Only for love
Only for love.
Love was never planned ever before.
Some have spent their whole life searching cold and insecure
But as suddenly as that love will arrive
And you'll recognize the feeling
Your on fire.
And especially when she moves in close
When she moves that move there's no suppose
You'll find your hurting when you're apart
But when you give your heart - it's
Only for love
Only for love
Only for love.
When you give your heart it should be
Only for love
Only for love

For a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises

Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go

Where I'm bound to the ground by the loneliest sound

A cage or the heaviest cross ever made
A gauge of the deadliest trap ever laid

And I thank you for bringing me here
For showing me home
For singing these tears
Finally I've found that I belong here

The heat and the sickliest sweet smelling sheets
That cling to the backs of my knees and my feet
Well I'm drowning in time to a desperate beat

Mom, she's like her mother was
That's the way it is

Everything's always coming around again
Just like music is, like fashion

Limbeck,"There's a sink full of dishes
No juice in the fridge
I'm trying not to go out
I'm trying to stay in the house

And I think what am I doing
What am I doing?
I'm trying not to go out
On account of the drought

There's just a big drag going around
Last night I blew it
I played two games of pool and
I forgot my card, I left it at the bar

I dreamed that I went
To that Thai place with you
You know the one that we went to
Two nights before

Now there's just a big drag going around
And I don't know why
And I'm no good at pool
And you know it's true
That there's just a big drag going around

",Big Drag
Limbeck,"I wound up in a cold, dark, lonely forest
With trees so high, they nearly disappeared
In the sky a small bird was flying around
The leaves on the trees were falling

I felt as though that bird seemed quite familiar
I remembered that his name was Parking Lot
Me and that bird fell beneath a tree in the snow
And died several years ago

All my friends came calling
Thinking that I'd gone lost
All of them were searching
For me and Parking Lot

We left for a house up on the hillside
With broken stairs and graffiti on the walls
The kid, that's where he lived, wrote for a magazine
And we all stood outside talking

The owner was a man from Texas
Who had left the place and brought his family
The kid extended an invitation to me
To stay for as long as I needed

After a few years, the man got homesick
He moved back in and started cleaning up
And even though I was never lost with Parking Lot
I was glad to have friends who'd come find me

When all my friends came calling
Thinking that I had gone lost
I was simply sleeping in a parking lot

When all my friends came searching
Looking for my ghost
I was lost inside a dream
In a parking lot

",Bird Problems
Limbeck,"Big double doors and a red tile floor
I can't really say that I've been here before
It's good for the change, I suppose
Do come in- my brother, my friend
We've already met, but let's meet again
I've been around too many times

I've been thinking
Listening to the second hand
It's good to be good to people you don't understand

This place is dirty, even when it's still early
The smell fillin' the airs so strong, that it hurts me
But I'm still so glad just to be around
Do what you like, but try not to knock it
Be glad you picked it up before you almost lost it
There's a lot of good in the world to be found

Limbeck,"I spent all my money at the House of Guitars
I've been trying to take a break but it's just so hard
I should save the money to fix my car
I've been trying to get home but it's just so far

I just want to be content
No matter where I am
I guess I shouldn't have to take the chance
I'm gonna get back to the city where I live

So I drove downstate in a broken car
I've been six long weeks, every night in a bar
It's hard to find some rest in a place you don't know
I fell asleep on a tarp on the ground 'neath the stars

I just want to be content
No matter where I am
I guess I shouldn't have to take the chance
I'm gonna get back to the city where I live

It feels like I grew up too late
Been refusing to finish everything on my plate
I've been spending most of my time
Trying to find some peace of mind

I'm walking to the store, I sold my car
Don't need a car
Anyway, it's a nice day outside and it's not that far

",Let Me Come Home
Limbeck,"Hey man, I've been talking to your friend
And she seems like a good friend
Are there any problems you see?
But, what's that got to do with me?

Well, I already know her
I know what she's done before
And when I ever see her around
I find the way out

But you can do what you want to do
It's no thing to me
But if I were on the shore with you
I wouldn't go in the sea

When I gave up my heart
It didn't hurt, no, it didn't hurt
It's like I said from the start
It's never gonna work
No, never gonna work
It's just crazy

What's wrong with having a good time?
I guess it would be alright
But you're gonna get so much more
She's never gonna leave you alone

I can't say I'll feel sorry for you
Because I already warned you
I'm not saying that she's so bad
Well, I guess I am

You'll spend too much time talking back and forth
After a while, maybe she'll come over
Your friends will start to talk and you'll probably ignore them
A week or two will pass on then

",Let's Get Crazy
Limbeck,"A woman's crying on the bus
I'm just trying with the rest
To get down south, I know I will
A man's carrying bags for a woman who sat down
In front of me, talking to herself

A man in front, he's riding with us
Just to get himself out of the sun
I've seen him on this line before
He's got a new hospital bracelet on
And I'll be here for a very long time

She's still trying on the bus, I'm so quiet on it
There's one man who's barely concerned
All the others seem to think she's crazy
We're really all a little too lazy

To ask what's wrong? What's wrong with you?
Why are you crying on the bus?
What's wrong? What's really, really wrong?

I'll be here for a very long time
I'll be here for a very long time
I'll be here reading the street signs as they go by

Throwing papers on the bus, can't escaper's in the fuss
I liked the man with the hat and the cane
Unit he started scowling at the teenager in back
Right after he just came in

What's wrong? What's wrong with you?
Why are you causing troubles for us?
What's wrong? What's really, really wrong?
I'll be here for a very long time

",Reading the Street Signs
Limbeck,"You're sleeping on the bed right in front of me
I found some paper by the desk in the lobby
I'm trying quiet not to wake you up
As the Tucson sun is coming up

I couldn't sleep, there's a TV in the lounge
But the buttons confuse me
You're in there trying to look some things up
As the Tucson sun is coming up

Street lights are turning off
The guests are waking up

As the train keeps rolling by like every hour
And the cars start stumbling by outside
It's time to find the way to my room to get some sleep

I'm trying to find the way to Bisbee
With a map that I found in the lobby
Stop for a shot from a little shop-owner
With that Tucson sun on my shoulders
Then you go through the Mule Pass tunnel
And this town has got the biggest hole I've ever seen
Hot sun's going down over Bisbee

Street lights are turning on again, everyone's going home
Look out the window, got to run to get home
See, this trains only going home three times a week
So I've got to get out of this hotel room
Run through the lobby with my stuff, across the street

To that train that's been rolling through the whole night long
As the cars start rumbling by, I'm stumbling across the street
The air outside's still got the heat from the day
I'm running through the doors, weaving through the seats

In the station praying that they wait
One minute more, stay until I climb aboard
And find myself a seat to get some sleep

",Sunset Limited
Limbeck,"It doesn't matter what you say
If you say it in distortion
Like telling a crowd, ""I'm gonna try you out""

I don't like it
I don't know if you and I get each other
But I'm tired of talking

My patience is used up
And I'm feeling worn out
The wind keeps blowing the dust in my face
And re-arranging my hairdo

And you're going your way
But I really don't care about that
Because I went my way when I was you

The future's a blank page
I don't know if you and I get each other
But I'm tired of talking

I'm in trouble, I've been here for a while
Someone's coming, I see 'em on the rise
And who knows where all the people have gone
All I know is that I want to go home

I'm in trouble, I've been here for a while
Someone's coming, I see 'em on the rise
It's nothing but trouble, but my glass is looking fine
I see 'em coming and it makes me realize
I am just fine, I've been here for a while

Someone's coming, I see 'em on the rise
It's nothing but trouble, but my glass is looking fine

Limbeck,"The phone rang early in the morning
My eyes stung as I stumbled down the hallway
I found my friend at breakfast in the lobby
If I slept in I wouldn't have this

Oh, today
I wouldn't want to live it like yesterday, honey
I could have been dreaming
But I'm having some fruit with you

Took a swim and so did my laundry
Good morning, it's getting better by the coffee
Read a book, write a book or something
It's just free time that I took

Oh, today
I wouldn't want to live it like yesterday, honey
I could have been dreaming
But I'm spending some time with you

I'd take a second try maybe
If I forgot my only plans
But now's that time and the air's alright
For a circle around the inn

",Wake Up
Limbeck,"When I met her, I was in a hole in the ground
And she started helping pull me out
Then she disappeared
And I went further down

You were so busy, I was busy losing my job
Now I've got the time for making up your mind for you
Selfish? I'm not selfish
I'd say I'm a pretty nice dude

I want your love, if you can give it up
And I think you got what I need
And I need to thank you
For coming to California

I was in the basement
Digging a hole beneath the house
It seemed a bear inside the washer
It was trying to get out

The air changed, some leaves fell
I sobered up and I wished you well
You were gone
I just had a lot on my mind

So many times a good thing goes to waste
And it's a shame
I've been around to see ideas fade away
And it's all the same

How many times do you have to remind me?
I can't get it out of my head

I figured you were happy
Doing all your things at the time
But when you tell your story
It sounds a lot like mine

Lying in your death bed 
Now you're just a reject 
You put your finger in Mc'why D's just to gain a little respect

You need to drop that feakin' ego before you crash 
Before the headlights are simply glaring in your eyes and you're goin' down 
What's the matter with the life that you're leadin' 
When you're bleedin' everyone's thinking how much they hate you 

It's not to late dude, just that time for you to zip up that grill 
Take a deep breath, look around, ain't nobody left 
Just a target, bulls eye 
Still you walk around in a clown like a clown in a force field

From that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor

Well it takes a strong man baby
But I'm showin' you that door
Well I gotta have faith

Got to have faith [Repeat: x3]

Baby, I know you're askin' me to stay
Say please, please, please don't go away
'Cause you're givin' me the blues
Maybe, you might mean all the words you say

Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to the lover boy blues
Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you pick my heart up off the floor

When our love comes down
Without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby

Just to use me 
And verbally abuse me

It took a while to see the light before I stopped 
And you got dropped off 

It's over, probably I'll be sweatin' it

When it's over I'll be hunting you down
Waiting for the payback, your frown
Begging me for your mercy

And I always remember your tender love
Wipe me under the rug

Take your ass and get a job like you should jerk
Unless you're livin where the trash is
But you're not so find another spot where the cash is

Me, I'm broke

Gimme back my money, bum
You said you'd pay me back
I'm broke and for that
You deserve a smackin' for slackin'
Now people say I'm a slacker
If I'm a slacker
Then its through the eyes of the ones that are blind",I'm Broke

But came to show ya 
That bizkits limp when the night is over. 
We shake the whole place 
Make this earth quake

Limp Bizkit,"This pain in my stomach won't go away. I assume this is punishment from all 
The mistakes I've made. In a world where my actions speak louder than words. 
In a world where my actions speak louder than words I know more people than 
Ever before. One lesson I've learned from it all. Fortune and fame are 
Disguised as your friend 'cause I'm lonlier now than I've ever been.... and to 
Everyone who takes the time read my lyrics I would to say that my life is 
Seen through by my eyes only, but I open myself to you so that we can 
Communicate on a level that only human beings like yourself can comprehend. 
We are a breed apart from the rest of the cold world. We get it. We are real. 
Your vision is all that matters. Let nothing get in your way. I hope that 
None of you experience certain things that I have, but at the same time I 
Want everyone to experience life because that's all we get....i

Lava stamps and brands me like a barcode
I'm Dashin all the meteor strikes

And that alone with keep John Ghotti on the phone
Tangled in his own I got the bees on the track

Shut the fuck up!

That keep my total bills over a million

Thank God I'm blessed with the mind that I wreck it
Wait until the second round, I'll knock him out

Too much for you thugs
That can't stand the flood

Hold big gun like Elmer Fudd
The sure shot

Temperature's too hot for sunblock
Burn
Playin with minds can get you state time
Lock behind twelve bars from a great mind
Killa bees in the club when there's ladybug
Brought a sword to tha dance floor to cut a rug
Love is love all day 'til they both slug
And take another life in cold blood
Can't feel me?
Cause it's your blood

Crime is endless
Same shit different day

They know not what they do

Why risk it
Lifestyles of the prolific and gifted
Eight essential vitamins and minerals
Delicious
Word on the street is

Knocked out their front teethes
Tryin to taste mine
Actin like they heard through the grapevine
Dope fiendin for the baseline
To provide rhyme

Hard as nails to the cubicle
Where you find that monster
She beautiful
Wu-Tang and Limp Bizkit
Roll on the check
Kick a hole in the speaker
Pull the plug and inject

Mic check
So what's it all about?
Where we gonna run?
Maybe we can meet up on the sun
Discretion is advised
For the blood of virgin eyes
Limpin on the track with Method
So get the sunblock
You get your one shot
Until you dissolve
I revolve around everything you got
From outta nowhere prepare
You'll be blinded by the glare
I told you not to stare
Now you're turned into stone
Without a microphone
But don't you forget you're in the zone
So shut the fuck up!
And take that shit back
Cause all your shit's whack
Doodoo is doodoo
When it's way down like that
Burnin up your brain like a piston
So all those who didn't listen
Never even knew what they were missin
And never even knew that the sky was fallin down

Well you're not
I think you're dumb ditty dumb

Thank God I'm blessed with the mind that I wreck it 
Wait until the second round, I'll knock him out 

They call me big John stud 
My middle name mud 
Dirty water flow 
Too much for you thugs 
That can't stand the flood 
What up doc? 
Hold big gun like Elmer Fudd 
The sure shot 
Mr. Meth I'm unplugged 
Learn 
Temperature's too hot for sunblock 
Burn 
Playin with minds can get you state time 
Lock behind twelve bars from a great mind 
Killa bees in the club when there's ladybug 
Brought a sword to tha dance floor to cut a rug 
Love is love all day 'til they both slug 
And take another life in cold blood 
Can't feel me? 
Cause it's your blood 
Murder is tremendous 
Crime is endless 
Same shit different day 
Father forgive us 
They know not what they do 
Our praises do 
I'm big like easy, ya bigbamboo

Shut the fuck up! 
Come on a little louder 
Shut the fuck up!

Twelve rounds of throwdown 
Who hold crown? 
Protect land with both pound

Get around like merry-go 
What's the scenario? 
Comin' through your stereo 
Why risk it 
Lifestyles of the prolific and gifted 
Eight essential vitamins and minerals 
Delicious 
Word on the street is 
They bit my thesis 
Knocked out their front teethes 
Tryin to taste mine 
Actin like they heard through the grapevine 
Dope fiendin for the baseline 
To provide rhyme 
Pharmaceuticals 
Hard as nails to the cubicle 
Where you find that monster 
She beautiful 
Wu-Tang and Limp Bizkit 
Roll on the check 
Kick a hole in the speaker 
Pull the plug and inject 

Mic check 
So what's it all about? 
Where we gonna run? 
Maybe we can meet up on the sun 
Discretion is advised 
For the blood of virgin eyes 
Limpin on the track with Method 
So get the sunblock 
You get your one shot 
Until you dissolve 
I revolve around everything you got 
From outta nowhere prepare 
You'll be blinded by the glare 
I told you not to stare 
Now you're turned into stone 
Without a microphone 
But don't you forget you're in the zone 
So shut the fuck up!
And take that shit back 
Cause all your shit's whack 
Doodoo is doodoo
When it's way down like that 
Burnin up your brain like a piston 
So all those who didn't listen 
Never even knew what they were missin 
And never even knew that the sky was fallin down 
Wu-Tang Clan for the crown 

What's that, I didn't hear you?

We're a fucked up place

Everybody's judged by their fucked up face
Fucked up dreams
Fucked up life

With a fucked up knife
Fucked up moms
And fucked up dads
It's a fucked up cop

With a fucked up badge
Fucked up job

From fucked up sex
Fake ass titties
On a fucked up chest

So what you want to do?
We fucked up me
And fucked up you

You want to fuck me like an animal
You'd like to burn me on the inside
You like to think that I'm a perfect drug
Just know that nothing you do
Will bring you closer to me

Ain't life a bitch?
A fucked up bitch
A fucked up soul with a fucked up stitch
A fucked up head

Is a fucked up shame
Swinging on my nuts
Is a fucked up game
Jealousy filling up a fucked up mind

It's real fucked up
Like a fucked up crime

That's forty six ""Fucks"" in this fucked up rhyme

All the bullshit that I find. 
Life is overwhelming 
Heavy is the head that wears the crown 
I'd love to be the one to disappoint you 
When I don't fall down. 

But you don't understand when 
I'm attempting to explain. 
Because you know it all and I guess things will never change. 
But you might need my hand when 
Falling in your whole. 
Your disposition I'll remember 
When I'm letting go

Of you and me 
We're through and re-arranged
We're through and re-arranged 

You're no good for me. 
Thank God it's over

You make believe 
That nothing is wrong until you're cryin'
You make believe 
That life is so long until you're dyin'
You make believe 
That nothing is wrong until you cryin', cryin' on me 
You make believe 
That life is so long until you're dyin', dyin' on me!

You can't talk to me
You're not supposed be, in my face
So get the fuck outta my face
Why you insist?
You gotta talk that shit
You gotta keep that dog-ass breath
All up in my face

I remember when
You would never lie to a friend
'Cause you were so high
You were so shy
You were so fucked up anyway

Life keeps on tickin'
Tickin', tickin' into the future
'Cause this is how we learn
Somebody better stop me
Or at least stop this beat
Before we start getting outta hand
'Cause this is how we learn
And this is how we burn

Somebody better stop me
Or at least stop this beat
Before we start getting outta hand
'Cause this is how we learn
And this is how we burn

You're all up in my face
And I don't know why, know why
And it goes somewhere with that shit
'Cause this is how we learn

'Cause you know it, know it lead the way
'Cause this is how we learn

You can't erase me
I'm alive as I can be, in your face
So get the fuck outta my face
Why you insist?
It's gonna turn out like this
You're gonna burn out like this
Burn up in my face

But I remember how
You said you want it all and you want it now
'Cause you were so young
You were so dumb
You were so fucked up anyway

So getcha getcha your groove on
Don't keep us waitin' too long

Don't you treat me like a toy kid
Do you enjoy this
Every single second I'm alive, I'm a mess
Got these laser beam mic checks
Communicating through the Genelec
High tech, keep you on the run

Now don't wanna be that guy
Every single second I'm alive
I'm alive I don't understand why
I got your trunk full of candy
And your so high bumping off the sweetness

Another little piece of me inside you
'Cause you know that I'll always keep it true

Extraordinary ability, shit longevity
Dig deep in your soul and find yourself
'Cause mind control could turn y'all to someone else

So fast your head'll probably spin the fuck right off
Me and Fred about to go half on Microsoft
Them live earning twenty percent
Those little half-assed direct hits
Ain't even making a dent

What an event, ah Hell, Xzibit and Limp
As we attempt to bring home
The championship it's all in the risk
I'll still lead the league and assist
Give me the fifth I'm drinking while I'm taking a piss, bitch

I got untapped material, I serial kill shit give me that real shit
X finish em off quick, makin' your jaw split
When I'm touching the mosh pit
Constant conflict knockin' faggot's unconscious
Nauseous raisin' the stakes

Increasin' the weight
Got homies that can lay down and lift the plate
So, quit tryin' to invade my space
Before I call for a face-to-face
And got to rest my case like

This is how we do it
Just recognize we keep gettin' right to it
Lookin' into these eyes
Lookin' into these eyes
And you'll see the size of the flames
Then you might despise the size of my game

Step the fuck back, Xzibit's on the track
You should have buckled up before your head hit the dash
You gotta hate that demo from an eight-track
Brought me to a place where platinum comes in eight stacks, bitch

",My Way [P. Diddy Remix]
Limp Bizkit,"Who can be the boss? 
Look up to the cross 
Stranded in the land of the lost 
Standin up, I'm sideways 
I'm blazin' up the path 
Runnin on the highways of rap 
Choked up by the smoke and the charcoal 
Lava stamps and brands me like a barcode 
I'm Dashin all the meteor strikes 
Keep the media dykes 
As re-enforcements for the fight 
And that alone with keep John Ghotti on the phone 
Tangled in his own I got the bees on the track 
Where the fuck you at? 
Tical
Let me hear you pigeons run your mouth now 
Shut the fuck up!
I'm pluggin in them social skills 
That keep my total bills over a million 
The last time I checked it 
Thank God I'm blessed with the mind that I wreck it 
Wait until the second round, I'll knock him out 

They call me big John stud 
My middle name mud 
Dirty water flow 
Too much for you thugs 
That can't stand the flood 
What up doc? 
Hold big gun like Elmer Fudd 
The sure shot 
Mr. Meth I'm unplugged 
Learn 
Temperature's too hot for sunblock 
Burn 
Playin with minds can get you state time 
Lock behind twelve bars from a great mind 
Killa bees in the club when there's ladybug 
Brought a sword to tha dance floor to cut a rug 
Love is love all day 'til they both slug 
And take another life in cold blood 
Can't feel me? 
Cause it's your blood 
Murder is tremendous 
Crime is endless 
Same shit different day 
Father forgive us 
They know not what they do 
Our praises do 
I'm big like easy, ya bigbamboo 

What's that, I didn't hear you? 
Shut the fuck up! 
Come on a little louder 
Shut the fuck up! 
Everybody N 2 Gether now 
Shut the fuck up! 
What? What? 

Headstrong, deadcon, dead by dawn 
Deadweight they dead wrong 
Let's get it on 
Twelve rounds of throwdown 
Who hold crown? 
Protect land with both pound 
Limp Bizkit 
Get around like merry-go 
What's the scenario? 
Comin' through your stereo 
Why risk it 
Lifestyles of the prolific and gifted 
Eight essential vitamins and minerals 
Delicious 
Word on the street is 
They bit my thesis 
Knocked out their front teethes 
Tryin to taste mine 
Actin like they heard through the grapevine 
Dope fiendin for the baseline 
To provide rhyme 
Pharmaceuticals 
Hard as nails to the cubicle 
Where you find that monster 
She beautiful 
Wu-Tang and Limp Bizkit 
Roll on the check 
Kick a hole in the speaker 
Pull the plug and inject 

Mic check 
So what's it all about? 
Where we gonna run? 
Maybe we can meet up on the sun 
Discretion is advised 
For the blood of virgin eyes 
Limpin on the track with Method 
So get the sunblock 
You get your one shot 
Until you dissolve 
I revolve around everything you got 
From outta nowhere prepare 
You'll be blinded by the glare 
I told you not to stare 
Now you're turned into stone 
Without a microphone 
But don't you forget you're in the zone 
So shut the fuck up!
And take that shit back 
Cause all your shit's whack 
Doodoo is doodoo
When it's way down like that 
Burnin up your brain like a piston 
So all those who didn't listen 
Never even knew what they were missin 
And never even knew that the sky was fallin down 
Wu-Tang Clan for the crown 

What's that, I didn't hear you? 
Shut the fuck up! 
Come on a little louder 
Shut the fuck up!

Shut the fuck up!

In a world of cleanliness and you know all that other madness

I was feedin' my rage as a little boy

Sang a lot of blues as an older man

Put together my crew as an older man

Mixin' rock with the funk as an older man
Learned what a girl was as an older man

Still I'm singin' in the rain as an older man

Overlook the aftermath
Make my tears be your bath

Go with me to the other side
Even though it's gonna crumble down
I'll keep building 'till you come around
Even though it's gonna fall apart, break my heart
I'll keep building 'till I die
Build a bridge of memories
Stretch it out overseas
To the end of the world
If there's a way
Build a bridge made of pain
Send my longing down the drain
Have no reasons to complain

Wait wait for me wait please wait for me

Hey kid, who you lookin' at?
Why you standin' all up in my face like that?
You ain't never seen a baseball bat?
A maniac knockin' on your babeball cap
You better step about ten paces back
Or you'll be layin' where your shoe laces at
Go do what your momma told you
And don't be actin' like a punk, thinkin' your a soldier
I see you got a cell phone, I got a number you can dial son, make it 911
Tell 'em stop at hef's house on the way kid
Pick up some playmates but only if they naked
Don't know how you do in your city
But 'round here we gettin' down to the nitty gritty
And I hate to put you out like that
But you've been burnin' like a fire with a mouth like that

Take me back to yesterday
Rollin' dice and getting laid
Everything was a.o.k. oh
But now and then a cloud rolls in
Rains on my parade and then
Talkin' this and that again, oh

Let's break it down for a minute
And roll it on up in third gear for a minute
I got the 21's bumpin' on my benz, and
I got girlies in the back seat rubbin' on my friends, and
I don't really give a fuck about
What these player hatin' pussies give a fuck about
'Cause I'm a night ranger, never been a stranger
My two-way pager is lookin' for some danger
Zoolander, hit you with the magnum
Everybody get your groove on if you have one
And if you ain't got it then admit it:
It's limpbizkit, time for you to get it
All around the world and this 45 prevost
Everywhere we go we watch it on the tivo
And now you're layin' in the bed you made
Drinkin' hatorade, think about it

Take me back to yesterday
Rollin' dice and getting laid
Everything was a.o.k. oh...

Rains on my parade and then
Talkin' this and that again, go

Mister, hale - tosis of the breath
Livin' lifestyles of the wish-you-would
From the back isles of the thrifty-good
See I, I got room to talk, kid
I been layin' this track since north cackilack
And the very first day that you fell out the sack
I was in some fat laces, spinnin' on my back
Let me think, let me roll, let me ride
Let me put some funk in the trunk, triple 5
And a memory that can easy your pain
Like a melody from kurt cobain
'Cause ya', never know when it's all gonna end
And ya', never know when you'll call on a friend
So you better take a step to prepare yourself
'Cause the way you're livin' now, ain't good for your health

Limp Bizkit,"When i reminisce ignorance was bliss,
Back in the days where the magic exist
Never be the same as it was, 'cause the way it was
Just another day in the maze of a myth
Had a lot of fun living life on the run,
Never had a chance to pause to get a better glance
Everything was free and everything was fast
Never even thought it wouldn't last
When you go the mind of a man in the middle
Life is just a big fat riddle, so figure it out
Always thinking that you know
Everything little thing there is to know
Buy you don't really know, ya know?
It's like love, some people get it
For some it's just a glove that just never fitted
For me it's just a pain in the ass
But i'm addicted to the taste of hopin' it could last

[chorus]
Another day another night inside a lonely world
Another game another fight inside a lonely world
Another wrong another right inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world, such a lonely world
Who's the man (the man in the middle) x4

Maybe i'm a target for people that are bitter
At least i can say that i've never been a quitter
I remember high school, man i hated high school
It was like prison with bullies always putting me down
Just a little skater boy they could pick on
I learned to forgive'em, now i got the balls they can lick on
I loved sneakin' out when my mom was asleep
With my gothic girlfriend makin' love in the creek
With the mind of a man in the middle
It could be the end of the world as we know it
Still i never want it all, and i never want it now
I just want to cruise, if i loose then i'll figure it out
How the times flies, even with the blink of an eye
When you're young you absorb like a sponge in disguise
Then you get a little older and gather your thoughts
It's amazing what you learn
When you've never been taught, ya know?

[chorus]

No matter how hard i can try inside a lonely world
No one can hear me when i cry inside a lonely world
I'll never know the reasons why inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world (such a lonely world)

A little time then we can do

Don't get me wrong just take my hand
And I really hope you understand that
It's easier when every second counts
So we'll just have to wait

You know, I lost my place a long time ago
about fifty fucking rhymes ago
I'm wrecking again

Locked inside this key chamber
There's millions of keys inside

and I'm not fading away, so I'll just have to die

I need a new outlet to feed

What can I do?

I think I'll just become a priest
Deceiving them with my belief
I'll preach about what life is worth
And cover my sins with the church
My demons can run around free
No one will suspect a thing
I'll show them it's okay to lust

I see priests molesting children
I see terrorists blowing up buildings
I see someone in rage killing Dime Bag on stage

What the fuck is this?
I got a kid, should I send him to Sunday School?
I got a kid, should I send him to Sunday School?
So you can fuck him!?

Hypnosis has taken control, now you linger
on a shadow of a doubt
Have you really figured what you're all about?
Don't trust your instincts
Just open the chamber where you keep those darkest regrets
All the things you've done wrong
Rebellious at heart all along
Is your leader a voice?
Somehow you replaced all your game with a debt
Now the payback's a bitch
Why owe your life to a bitch?
Absolutely pathetic
and regret it when told you are made of mistakes

Where you at Jacksonville, Rochester, Louisville
Columbia, Hartford, Milwaukee and Lewiston Maine?
Where you at Providence, Nashville, Memphis, Lauderdale
Portland, Orlando, Chicago and Frisco?
I left my heart in Austin with Mary Campbell
Got lost in Boston lookin' for the tea party
Met a child molester in Worcester
I need a Kleenex every time I'm leavin' Phoenix
I get silly when I play in Philly

Never know what I'm in for when I'm play in Denver
Hard rock don't stop down in Vegas
In Cincinnati the girls call me Daddy
And I probably ain't leavin' the next time I'm in Cleveland

And spit on a boy named Tina in Pasadena

These bands, these stories and the places that I've been
I thank God, mom and dad, Adriana for the love I feel inside
Jordan, my phat ass band without 'em I'd be nothin'
But a pumpkin shoved inside a can
Without the fans there wouldn't be no show
And if that was really so then life would really blow
To the firm you always got my back
Korn for the love and the swappin' of the tracks

We brought it to the plate and you made it sound great
Scott Weiland the melody man if you can't sing it nobody can
Wu-Tang Clan skills from the method

Slim shady crazy ass cracker, Staind a brand new drug for your brain
Les Claypool, for actin' like a fool
And all of the bands for the demos that were cool
I'm so grateful for this life of mine
The ones I didn't thank I will some other time

Lin Halliday,"East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way dear
Sharing our love in the pale moonlight

Just you and I, 
Forever and a day
Love will not die, 
We'll keep it that way
Up among the stars 
We'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune

Lin Halliday,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Lin Halliday,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

你的项链 在我身边 发光在我胸前
你的项链 在我身边 陪伴着我过每一天

不小心回到那一天 
不小心一切又重演
你如此完美的一切 
竟会出现在我的世界
你说话不爱说第二遍
但偏在情人节那一夜
给我你心爱的项链 
说了三次对我的爱恋
我那时糊涂 
不明白为何你会哭
后知后觉以后 领悟

冻结那时间 冻结初遇那一天
冻结那爱恋 冻结吻你那瞬间
我  也会疲倦
你的项链 在我身边 带我穿梭回从前
冻结那空间 冻结有你的世界

Before they passed on

I wake up and I got this little punk I gotta chase away
Pop the grate at the crack of dawn, sing
While I wipe down the awning
Hey y'all, good morning

Ice cold piragua!
Parcha
China
Cherry
Strawberry
And just for today, I got mamey!

Oye, piragüero, como estas?

Como siempre, Señor Usnavi

I am Usnavi and you prob'ly never heard my name
Reports of my fame are greatly exaggerated
Exacerbated by the fact that my syntax
Is highly complicated 'cause I emigrated
From the single greatest little place in the Caribbean:
Dominican Republic!
I love it!

Jesus, I'm jealous of it
And beyond that
Ever since my folks passed on
I haven't gone back
Goddamn, I gotta get on that

Fo! The milk has gone bad, hold up just a second
Why is everything in this fridge warm and tepid?
I better step it up and fight the heat
'Cause I'm not makin' any profit if the coffee isn't light and sweet!

Ooo-oo!

Abuela, my fridge broke
I got café but no ""con leche""

Try my mother's old recipe: one can of condensed milk

Nice​

Ay! Paciencia y fe

That was Abuela, she's not really my ""abuela""
But she practically raised me, this corner is her escuela
Now, you're prob'ly thinkin:
""I'm up shit's creek!
I've never been north of Ninety-Sixth Street!”
Well, you must take the A Train
Even farther than Harlem to northern Manhattan and maintain
Get off at 181st, and take the escalator
I hope you're writing this down, I'm gonna test ya later

I'm getting tested; times are tough on this bodega
Two months ago somebody bought Ortega's
Our neighbors started packin' up and pickin' up
And ever since the rents went up
It's gotten mad expensive
But we live with just enough

In the heights
I flip the lights and start my day
There are fights

Endless debts

And bills to pay

In the Heights
I can't survive without café

I serve café

'Cause tonight seems like a million years away!
En Washington

Next up to bat, the Rosarios
They run the cab company
They struggle in the barrio
See, their daughter Nina's off at college, tuition is mad steep
So they can't sleep
Everything they get is mad cheap!

Good morning, Usnavi!

Pan caliente, café con leche!

Put twenty dollars on today's lottery

One ticket, that's it!

Hey! A man’s gotta dream

Don't mind him, he's all excited
'Cause Nina flew in at 3 A.M. last night!

Don't look at me, this one's been cooking all week!

Usnavi, come over for dinner

There's plenty to eat!

So then Yesenia walks in the room

Aha

She smells sex and cheap perfume!

Uh oh

It smells like one of those trees
That you hang from the rear view!

Haha, no!

It's true! She screams, ""Who's in there with you, Julio?""
Grabs a bat and kicks in the door
He's in bed with José from the liquor store!

No me diga!

Daniela and Carla, from the salon

Thanks, Usnavi!

Sonny, you're late

Chillax, you know you love me​

Me and my cousin runnin' just another dime-a-dozen
Mom-and-pop stop-and-shop
And, oh my god, it's gotten
Too darn hot, like my man Cole Porter said
People come through for a few cold waters and
A lottery ticket, just a part of the routine
Everybody's got a job, everybody's got a dream
They gossip, as I sip my coffee and smirk
The first stop as people hop to work
Bust it— I’m like:

""One dollar, two dollars, one fifty, one sixty-nine
I got it
You want a box of condoms?
What kind?
That's two quarters​
Two quarter waters
The New York Times
You need a bag for that?
The tax is added​""
Once you get some practice at it
You do rapid mathematics automatically
Sellin' maxipads, fuzzy dice for taxicabs and practically
Everybody's stressed, yes!
But they press through the mess
Bounce checks and wonder what’s next

Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter By being a self-starter

Across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain

Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We’ll get a little place in Harlem and we’ll figure it out
I’ve been livin’ without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I’ll never forget my mother’s face, that was real
And long as I’m alive, Eliza, swear to God
You’ll never feel so

For just a moment

Destroyed my town
I didn’t drown
I couldn’t seem to die

I wrote my way out
Wrote everything down far as I could see
I wrote my way out
I looked up and the town had its eyes on me

They passed a plate around
Total strangers
Moved to kindness by my story
Raised enough for me to book passage on a
Ship that was New York bound

I wrote my way out of hell
I wrote my way to revolution
I was louder than the crack in the bell
I wrote Eliza love letters until she fell
I wrote about The Constitution and defended it well
And in the face of ignorance and resistance
I wrote financial systems into existence
And when my prayers to God were met with indifference
I picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance

In the eye of a hurricane
There is quiet
For just a moment
A yellow sky

I was twelve when my mother died
She was holding me
We were sick and she was holding me
I couldn’t seem to die

Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it (I’ll write my way out)
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it (write everything down, far as I can see)
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait (history has its eyes on you)

I’m young, scrappy and hungry
And I’m not throwing away my shot
I’m ‘a get a scholarship to King’s College
I prob’ly shouldn’t brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge
I’m a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin’ to reach my goal my power of speech, unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Every burden, every disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don’t have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it’s getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the A-L-E-X-A-N-D-E-R we are meant to be

A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin’ on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain’t ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me, he says in parentheses

Don’t be shocked when your hist’ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you’ll see my ascendancy

Onarchy how you say, how you say, anarchy?
When I fight, I make the other side panicky

Yo, I’m a tailor’s apprentice
And I got y’all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I’m joining the rebellion 'cause I know it’s my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin’ some pants
I’m gonna take a shot

But we’ll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another shot

Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I’m with you, but the situation is fraught
You’ve got to be carefully taught

Poppin’ a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is

Oh, am I talkin’ too loud?

I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When’s it gonna get me?
In my sleep, seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin’, do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I’d live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin’ fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that’s plenty

Scratch that this is not a moment, it’s the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin’ our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin’ ‘n fightin’
I’ve been readin’ ‘n writin’
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states what’s the state of our nation?
I’m past patiently waitin' I’m passionatelymashin’ every expectation
Every action’s an act of creation
I’m laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I’m thinkin’ past tomorrow

Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree
And no one shall make them afraid
They'll be safe in the nation we've made
I wanna sit under my own vine and fig tree

At home in this nation we've made

Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration
I am unconscious of intentional error
I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects 
Not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors
I shall also carry with me

The hope
That my country will
View them with indulgence
And that
After forty five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal
The faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion
As I myself must soon be to the mansions of rest
I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat 
In which I promise myself to realize the sweet enjoyment of partaking
In the midst of my fellow citizens, the benign influence of good laws
Under a free government, the ever-favorite object of my heart
And the happy reward, as I trust
Of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers

Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British

Huh

I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

Yes?

Well

Have I done something wrong, sir?

On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary

Sir?

Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

Sir

Don’t get me wrong, you’re a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you

To be their Secretary? I don’t think so

Why’re you upset?

Alexander was on Washington's doorstep one day
In distress 'n disarray

Alexander said

I've nowhere else to turn

And basic'ly begged me to join the fray

Thomas claims

I approached Madison and said
I know you hate ‘im, but let's hear what he has to say

Thomas claims

Well, I arranged the meeting
I arranged the menu, the venue, the seating

Meanwhile

Madison is grappling with the fact that not ev'ry issue can be settled by committee

Meanwhile

Congress is fighting over where to put the capital

It isn't pretty
Then Jefferson approaches with a dinner and invite
And Madison responds with Virginian insight

Maybe we can solve one problem with another and win a victory for the Southerners, in other words

Oh ho

I suppose

Wouldn't you like to work a little closer to home

I remember that night, I just might (rewind)
I remember that night, I remember that

I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can’t quite place

But Alexander, I’ll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said hi, I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev’ry part aflame
This is not a game

You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

I’m sure I don’t know what you mean
You forget yourself

You’re like me
I’m never satisfied

Is that right?

I have never been satisfied

Where’s your fam’ly from?

Unimportant
There’s a million things I haven’t done but
Just you wait, just you wait

So so so
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? 
It’s the feeling of freedom, of seein’ the light
It’s Ben Franklin with a key and a kite
You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev’rything we said in total agreement, 
It’s a dream and it’s a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it’s a bit of a stance
He’s a bit of a flirt, but I’m ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam’ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He’s penniless, he’s flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it
Peach fuzz, and he can’t even grow it
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister’s face and she is

Helpless

And I know she is

And her eyes are just

And I realize

Three fundamental truths at the exact same time

Where are you taking me?

I’m about to change your life

Then by all means, lead the way

Number one

I’m a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I’m the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I’m the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
And Alexander is penniless
Ha
That doesn’t mean I want him any less

Elizabeth Schuyler
It’s a pleasure to meet you

Schuyler?

My sister

Number two

He’s after me 'cause I’m a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I’d
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that’s his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

Thank you for all your service

If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

I’ll leave you to it

Number three

I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she’d be silently resigned
He’d be mine
She would say, I’m fine
She’d be lying

But when I fantasize at night
It’s Alexander’s eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn’t sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza’s his wife
At least I keep his eyes in my life

To the groom (to the groom, to the groom, to the groom)

To the bride (to the bride, to the bride)

From your sister (Angelica, Angelica)

Who is always by your side

And the hope that you provide (you provide, you provide)

May you always (always)

Missing my wife
That's when Miss Maria Reynolds walked into my life, she said

I know you are a man of honor
I'm so sorry to bother you at home
But I don't know where to go, and I came here all alone

She said

My husband's doin' me wrong
Beatin' me, cheatin' me, mistreatin' me
Suddenly he's up and gone
I don't have the means to go on

So I offered her a loan, I offered to walk her home, she said

You're too kind, sir

I gave her thirty bucks that I had socked away
She lived a block away, she said

This one's mine, sir

Then I said, well, I should head back home
She turned red, she led me to her bed
Let her legs spread and said

Stay

Hey

Hey

That's when I began to pray
Lord, show me how to say no to this
I don't know how to say no to this

But my God, she looks so helpless
And her body's saying, hell, yes

Whoa

No, show me how to say no to this

I don't know how to say no to this

In my mind, I'm tryin' to go (go, go, go)

Then her mouth is on mine, and I don't say

No, no (say no to this)
No, no (say no to this)
No, no (say no to this)
No, no (say no to this)

I wish I could say that was the last time
I said that last time, it became a pastime
A month into this endeavor I received a letter
From a Mr. James Reynolds, even better, it said

Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
In the pockets of people like me down on their luck
You see, that was my wife who you decided to (fuuuu)

Uh oh, you made the wrong sucker a cuckold
So time to pay the piper for the pants you unbuckled
And hey, you can keep seein' my whore wife
If the price is right, if not I'm telling your wife

I hid the letter and I raced to her place
Screamed how could you in her face, she said

No, sir

Half dressed, apologetic, a mess, she looked pathetic, she cried

Please don't go, sir

So was your whole story a setup

I don't know about any letter (stop crying God dammit, get up)

I didn't know any better (I am ruined)

Please don't leave me with him helpless (I am helpless how could I do this?)
Just give him what he wants and you can have me (I don't want you, I don't want you)

Whatever you want, if you pay	 

You can stay (Lord, show me how to say no to this)
I don't know how to say no to this
'Cause the situation's helpless

And her body's screaming, hell, yes

No, show me how to say no to this (whoa)
How can I say no to this
There is nowhere I can go (go, go, go)

When her body's on mine I do not say (no) yes

Say no to this

(Yes) say no to this (no)

(Yes) say no to this (no)

Lin-Manuel Miranda,"How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton’s skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common
We’re reliable with the

Ladies

There are so many to deflower

Ladies
Looks
Proximity to power

And the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all
Yo, if you can marry a sister, you’re rich, son

Is it a question of if, Burr, or which one?

Hey hey, hey, hey, hey, hey",A  Winter's Ball
Lin-Manuel Miranda,"One-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight-nine
There are ten things you need to know (number one!)

We rowed across the Hudson at dawn
My friend, William P. Van Ness signed on as my (number two!)

Hamilton arrived with his crew
Nathaniel Pendleton and a doctor that he knew (number three!)

I watched Hamilton examine the terrain
I wish I could tell you what was happening in his brain
This man has poisoned my political pursuits!
Most disputes die and no one shoots (number four!)

Hamilton drew first position
Looking, to the world, like a man on a mission
This is a soldier with a marksman’s ability
The doctor turned around so he could have deniability (five!)

Now I didn’t know this at the time
But we were near the same spot my (your) son died, is that why? (six!)
He examined his gun with such rigor?
I watched as he methodically fiddled with the trigger

(Seven!) confession time? here’s what I got
My fellow soldiers’ll tell you I’m a terrible shot (number eight!)
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight

They won’t teach you this in your classes
But look it up, Hamilton was wearing his glasses
Why? If not to take deadly aim?
It’s him or me, the world will never be the same
I had only one thought before the slaughter
This man will not make an orphan of my daughter (number nine!)

Look him in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count (one-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight-nine, number-ten paces, fire!)

I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
Is this where it gets me, on my feet, sev’ral feet ahead of me?
I see it coming, do I run or fire my gun or let it be?
There is no beat, no melody
Burr, my first friend, my enemy
Maybe the last face I ever see
If I throw away my shot, is this how you’ll remember me?
What if this bullet is my legacy?

Legacy, what is a legacy?
It’s planting seeds in a garden you never get to see
I wrote some notes at the beginning of a song someone will sing for me
America, you great unfinished symphony, you sent for me
You let me make a difference, a place where even orphan immigrants
Can leave their fingerprints and rise up
I’m running out of time, I’m running, and my time’s up
Wise up, eyes up
I catch a glimpse of the other side
Lawrence leads a soldiers’ chorus on the other side
My son is on the other side
He’s with my mother on the other side
Washington is watching from the other side
Teach me how to say goodbye
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Eliza!

My love, take your time
I’ll see you on the other side
Raise a glass to freedom

(He aims his pistol at the sky) wait!

I strike him right between his ribs
I walk towards him, but I am ushered away
They row him back across the Hudson
I get a drink

(Aaaah, aaaah, aaaah)
I hear wailing in the streets (aaaah, aaaah, aaaah)
Somebody tells me, ""you’d better hide"" (aaaah, aaaah, aaaah)
They say Angelica and Eliza
Were both at his side when he died
Death doesn’t discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints, it takes and it takes and it takes
History obliterates, in every picture it paints
It paints me and all my mistakes
When Alexander aimed at the sky
He may have been the first one to die
But I’m the one who paid for it

I survived, but I paid for it

Now I’m the villain in your history
I was too young and blind to see
I should’ve known
I should’ve known the world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me
The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me",The World was Wide Enough

Monsieur Hamilton

Monsieur Lafayette

In command where you belong

How you say, no sweat
We're finally on the field
We’ve had quite a run

Immigrants

We get the job done

So what happens if we win?

I go back to France
I bring freedom to my people if I’m given the chance

We’ll be with you when you do

Go lead your men

See you on the other side

‘Til we meet again, let’s go

I am not throwin’ away my shot
I am not throwin’ away my shot
Hey yo, I’m just like my country, I’m young
Scrappy and hungry
And I’m not throwin’ away my shot
I am not throwin’ away my shot

‘Til the world turns upside down

‘Til the world turns upside down

I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
This is where it gets me: on my feet
The enemy ahead of me
If this is the end of me, at least I have a friend with me
Weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me
Then I remember my Eliza’s expecting me
Not only that, my Eliza’s expecting
We gotta go, gotta get the job done
Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son
Take the bullets out your gun (what?)

The bullets out your gun (what?)

We move under cover and we move as one
Through the night, we have one shot to live another day
We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away
We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it
It’s either that or meet the business end of a bayonet
The code word is ‘Rochambeau,’ dig me?

Rochambeau

You have your orders now, go, man, go
And so the American experiment begins
With my friends all scattered to the winds
Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining brav’ry

We’ll never be free until we end slavery

When we finally drive the British away
Lafayette is there waiting

In Chesapeake Bay

How did we know that this plan would work?
We had a spy on the inside
That’s right

Hercules Mulligan

A tailor spyin’ on the British government
I take their measurements, information and then I smuggle it (up)

To my brother's revolutionary covenant
I’m runnin’ with the Sons of Liberty and I am lovin’ it
See, that’s what happens when you up against the ruffians
We in the shit now, somebody gotta shovel it
Hercules Mulligan, I need no introduction
When you knock me down I get the fuck back up again

Left, right, hold
Go
What
What
What

After a week of fighting, a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet

We lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief

And just like that, it’s over
We tend to our wounded, we count our dead

Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom

Not yet

We negotiate the terms of surrender
I see George Washington smile
We escort their men out of Yorktown
They stagger home single file
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets
There are screams and church bells ringing
And as our fallen foes retreat
I hear the drinking song they’re singing

The world turned upside down

The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down

Down, down, down

Freedom for America, freedom for France

Just came in the door and they got somethin to say
Tell em step up if they want to act hard
I don't need no great big bodyguard
Only dump dimes when it's time to blaze the L
You can do it just as long as you don't hurt ya self
Pull up, hop out start spitting like the A.R.
1-5 cake or sky high oh my
Got the science and the formula for hatin chicks
And whatcha do, if you don't like me you can suck a dick
I'm smoother then a pair of lizard skins in '88
A lotta suckas portrayin us when we know they ain't
Get the fuck outta here your dealin with a rider here
The chef in hell's kitchen, I'm stayin here for  alotta years
And for my thugs, real bitches and all my hustlers
Keep it movin I ain't got no paitence for you bustas (DO IT)

And why shouldn't I kill it every time that I leave
When these fake mutha fucka's is so easy to read 'cause
My family got needs, my city need me
So I'mma do it from the muscle bitch believe me
Think 'cause I'm with Tim that I got it easy
but that don't stop me from smoking up in the Crown V
Stayin sucka free, weed in the truck with me

Lina,"I don't believe in frettin' and grievin',
Why mess around with strife?
I never was cut out to step and strut out.
Give me the simple life.

Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant.
Those things roll off my knife,
Just serve me tomatoes, and mashed potatoes,
Give me the simple life.

A cottage small is all I'm after,
Not one that's spacious and wide.
A house that rings with joy and laughter
And the ones you love inside.

Some like the high road, I like the low road,
Free from the care and strife.
Sounds corny and seedy, but yes, indeed-y,
Give me the simple life.",Walking (Interlude)

Lina Koutrakos,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,

Lina Nyberg,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

How still we see thee lie.
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary,
And, gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth.
And praises sing to God the King.
And peace to men on earth.

How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven.
No ear may hear His coming;
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive Him,
Still The dear Christ enters in.

Where children, pure and happy,
Pray to the Blessed Child;
Where misery cries out to thee,
Son of the Mother mild;
Where charity stands watching,
And faith holds wide the door,
The dark night wakes, the glory breaks,
And Christmas comes once more.

O Holy Child of Bethlehem,
Descend to us, we pray;
Cast out our sin and enter in;
Be born in us today!
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell;
O come to us, abide with us,

Let it be, dear Lord, let it be

When my feeble life is o'er
Time for me shall be no more
Guide me gently, safely o'er
To Thy kingdom shore, to Thy shore

When life's sun sinks in the west
Lord, may I have done my best
May I find sweet peace and rest
In that happy home of the blessed

Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be",Just a Closer Walk with Thee

Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near

Linda Cable,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.

Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love

And you looked into my eyes
I could hardly believe
Love took me by surprise
And now that we are friends
I don`t want it to end
`cause I would rather lose your love
To be your friend
I guess I never told you
Exactly how I feel

You`d probably just leave

Without you
Be on my own again
Without you

Don`t understand it
If I could have planned it
How would it be
There`s no use pretending
Don`t want our love ending

I could never let you know
And all the feelings I have
I`m too afraid to let them show
So I close my eyes and count to ten

To be your friend
I`d rather lose your love to be your friend",Just Friends

I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you said, ""go slow, I fall behind""

If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

Linda Davis,"She was only 19 when she married him
Now 10 years have come and gone
A broken heart and two kids later
Trying to make it in this world on her own
It gets harder each day to face the mirror
She knows 30's on the way
Afraid she'll find another wrinkle
Or spot another trace of gray

In the crash of 29
In the prime of her life
In the great depression
She sits at home and cries
She's lost the will to love
And wonders how she'll find
The strength or the heart to survive
The crash of 29

She hates him for the way he left her
Bittersweet memories hanging 'round
She hates herself because she still loves him
But only love can save her now

In the crash of 29
In the prime of her life
In the great depression
She sits at home and cries
She's lost the will to love

Linda Davis,"I know I haven't said the words the way I used to
I should have made the time I know
When I didn't know which way to turn, I'd turn to you
You always seem to know which way to go

You know you always seem to see the best in me
You stand by me no matter how things are
If I haven't told you lately how I feel
Let me tell you now what's in my heart

If I could only be like you
You always seem to see the good
And then you make a dream come true
And ask for nothing in return

You always know just what to do
You're someone I can look up to
I'd be a better me
If I could only be like you

You know you've always seen me through the worst of times
You have a way of lighting up the dark
And though we're sometimes far apart
Somehow I would cross the miles I still know you're never very far

You know you always seem to see the best in me
You stand by me no matter how things are
If I haven't told you lately how I feel
Let me tell you now what's in my heart

If I could only be like you

Linda Davis,"I had never even been outside the county line
Unless you count the million times I left inside my mind
In my day dreams I could see
The way the luck would shine on me
When I finally found the wings to fly
As my mama helped me pack my suitcase
She said you know I love you and I'll say it once more anyway

So you'll know what to do if your greener grass turns blue
If your sunny sky turns gray
Sometimes you gotta run
To see just what you're running from
Here at home there'll always be place for you
If your greener grass turns blue

I had tears in my eyes and a ticket in my hand
To give to the man at the station
I was so afraid that mama would say
Something to make me want to stay
But all she did was look at me and smile
She said I believe that you can make your dreams come true
But most of all I believe in you

So you'll know what to do if your greener grass turns blue
If your sunny sky turns gray
Sometimes you gotta run
To see just what you're running from
Here at home there'll always be place for you
If your greener grass turns blue

Linda Davis,"He calls to tell me he'll be late again
There's a problem at the office
So don't wait up for him
And I guess I shouldn't worry but I do
Cause a woman senses changes
Her man is going through

He's changed the way he's worn his hair for years
And bought some shirts in colors
I've never seen him wear
And when we touch that old time feeling's gone
There's a problem at the office
And it's hitting close to home

There's a problem at the office
He can't seem to solve
And it's taking him away from
Everything he loves
Oh and if it's what I think it is
It's gonna break my heart
There's a problem at the office
And it's tearing us apart

I've only seen her twice
He says she's new
But there's something there between us
And my heart feels it too
Oh the way she looks at him it's hard to miss
There's a problem at the office
I think I know who she is

Linda Davis,"The first time she saw him he stood at home plate
He knocked that curve ball almost out of state
The crowd went wild
He kinda smiled
And her heart melted away
The last time she saw him was at the airport gate
He'd write from college every other day
Letters sent
With good intent
But the miles got in the way
She tried to fall again
And every now and then she got real close
But it never worked out right
And with every sad goodbye her mind goes to

The boy back home
And their favorite song
And more shining stars than a girl could wish upon
Where there were no dreams
Out of reach
She'd go anywhere to find the boy back home

She drove last weekend to the old home town
Their favorite soda shop had been torn down
The drive-in's gone
And her heart longs
For a place that can't be found
And in the hours spent
In youthful innocence
Safe in the arms of

Every minute is a box car that don't come back

Whatever you see ain't never gonna stay the same
Except for the rain and the wind in the trees
And the way I feel about you and me

And the way I feel when I'm with you
It's like the roll of the ocean
And the calm quiet of the moon
And when you hold me time stands still
It always has and it always will

Out on the horizon the sun is goin' down
But it ain't gone it's just on it's way around
Just like your love I see it every day
In the things you do and the things you say
You touch my hand and I feel the thrill
I always have and always will

Linda Davis,"Go on and cry, but you won't change my mind
Your pain and troubles don't concern me
I gave you my love, but it was not enough
I was just your bridge and girl you burned me

So don't hand me no hard luck story
Hopin' I'll just fall apart
Remember you're the one who left me
With nothin' but this cast iron heart

There was a time my heart was good and kind
There was no end to what I'd give you
But now I've changed, my world's been rearranged
I've tried but I just can't forgive you

So don't hand me no hard luck story
Hopin' I'll just fall apart
Remember you're the one who left me
With nothin' but this cast iron heart

A cast iron heart, it can't show no mercy
A cast iron heart, it can't show no pain
So don't come to me for love or sympathy
'Cause there ain't none in this cast iron heart

Linda Davis,"You jet from coast to coast
Dressed in designer clothes
When you appear somewhere
Your chauffeur drives you there
I would think twice
If I could live your life

You see your friends at the store
Your sister lives next door
You kiss your babies goodnight
Your husbands there at your side
I'd love to give it a try
If I could live your life

If I could trade places with you
Hear the roar of the crowd
And the church bells in a quiet town

I wonder what this world would be like
If I could live your life

And I see you're in PTA

Linda Davis,"Jenny's got a trailer on the county line
Satellight dish working overtime
Watchin' those movies on a 30 inch screen
Dreamin' about places she's never seen

She's in the diner by five o'clock
Playin' Elvis on the old juke box
Staring out the window at nothing in sight
As she sings 'Are you lonesome tonight'

Every time some stranger walks in through that door
She can't help but wonder if he's the one she's been waiting for

It's a love story in the making
Something that was meant to be
A heart patiently waiting for a little bit of destiny
A sweet love story is all she needs

Bobby's got a one truck trucking line
Running double nickle tryin' to make a dime
Seven long years he's been rollin on
Wondering if he'll ever call someplace home

Lately he's been thinkin', it be kinda neat
To have someone over in the passenger seat

Another shoulder for the heavy load
Lately its' been such a lonely ol' road

Up ahead in the distance he sees a diner sign
Thinkin' its' just for the coffee, he shuts down and walks inside

It's a love story in the making
Something that was meant to be
A heart patiently waiting for a little bit of destiny
A sweet love story is all he needs

Over apple pie he asks for their first date
Thirty-eight states later there's a baby on the way

Linda Davis,"First time he laid eyes on her he kissed his heart goodbye
He nearly drove right off the road, all she did was smile
But when she burned up their first dinner and lay cryin' on the couch
That's the moment that he fell in love from the inside out

She loved the way he always brought flowers to the door
He took her to new places that she'd never been before
When he lost his job and he lost his pride and his heart was filled with doubt
That's when she knew how much she loved that man from the inside out

From the inside love is stronger
Than the outside lookin' in
When the tears flow you learn what love's about
From the inside out

She has watched her raven hair slowly turn to gray
Since the day that he retired he just gets in the way
Well they ain't much to look at, two old faces in the crowd
But they could write the book of love from the inside out

From the inside love is stronger
Than the outside lookin' in
And as the years go you learn what love's about
From the inside out
",From the Inside Out
Linda Davis,"I took the torch out of his old flame 
Now he's chasing after a faster train 
I used kisses sweet as rain 
When I took the torch out of his old flame 

She had a chance to wear his ring 
But she had her mind on other things 
Now he's through playing her little games 
Cause I took the torch out of his old flame 

All it took was one little look of love 
Now he's burnin' for my tender touch so sincerely 
I give him everything he needs 
Every time I hold him close to me

Linda Davis,"There's a woman at home, day after day 
Takes the kids to school and there's bills to pay 
Sends her husband to work with a kiss on the cheek 
They get by, but they hardly speak at all 
They've built too many walls 

And she knows that things aren't right 
But she never lets it show 
And she wonders where he goes at night 
But she doesn't really want to know 

There's a woman alone on the edge of town 
Works a fancy job till the sun goes down 
She loves a man who'll never be free 
But she waits by the phone cause he promised he would call 
Why did she ever fall 

And she knows that things aren't right 
But she never lets it show 
And she wonders if he's home tonight 
But she doesn't really want to know

He knows his heart should be at home 
But his fire burns for the woman alone so he calls

And he knows that things aren't right 
But he never lets it show 
And he wonders how to change his life

I just washed the car, oh yeah, the oil needs changing 
Bet it took ten seconds for you to cross my mind 

Left the thought of you behind me

By the time it caught me I was half way down the highway 
I'm moving on without you just a little at a time 

I've got a long, long way to go 
But I'll get over you one day I know 
I think a ray of hope has finally found me 
Here in the dark 
I can see some light through the cracks of my broken heart 

I just lost your memory somewhere in the traffic 
Just for a moment the D.J. had me laughing 
And the sun peeked through the storm clouds in the sky

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

Once we were standing still in time,
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds.
And you knew how I loved you but my spirit was free,
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me.
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to, do you know?

Now looking back at all we planned,
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands.
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to those questions can be?

Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to, do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you there's no open door.",Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)
Linda Eder,"The moon makes ribbons to surround you
Within the robe of dark around you
I see goodbye
A blade that cuts me from your eyes

I wonder why
It's time for honesty and answers
Love is the song- we are the dancers
A broken pair- we spin alone

And wonder where- the touch has gone
After all this time
After all we've been through
Is this all that we have

No- we still have time
To find each other- after all
I touch your face and feel you crying
Are all the words we've said been lies

We'll never leave- the place where hearts
Alone receive- what love believes After all this time
After all we've been through
Is this all that we have

No- we still have time
To find each other- after all
Within the deepest darkness
The seed of morning waits to grow

The sun will come- this much I know
After all this time
After all we've been through
If we hold on to love- just one more night

We'll find forever- after all
After all this time

If we hold on to love- just one more night

We'll find forever- after all

Linda Eder,"All of my life my heart's been waiting
To give someone love without it breaking
Time after time love passed me by
But with you I've got a chance to
Give it just one more try
Before I fall in love again
Before I give my love to you
I've got to feel this love is real
Before I fall with you
You've got the touch that I have longed for
This is the one that I had hoped for
Let's take our time at least through the night
And if tomorrow comes around
And we haven't changed our minds
Before I fall in love again
Before I give my love to you
I've got to feel this love is real
Before I fall with you

From this moment on, I'll be with you
Till the end of the time, I'll be yours
From this moment on two hearts become one
I'm gonna love you from this moment on
To choose from the rest, surely I wasn't the best
About a million to one
For a chance to be yours, I would gladly endure
A million nights alone
Each time I look in your eyes
I know what loves all about
From this moment on, I'll be with you
Till the end of the time, I'll be yours
From this moment on two hearts become one

We'll steal a little bit of heaven tonight
I'll show you how, it's there for the taking

A new life to love

Linda Eder,"Watching the rain fall in Vienna
Pictures of another time
From the corner of a small cafe
We watched the world go by

Now we sit here the best of strangers
We played the game for all it's worth
Endless nights in Vienna's eyes
Take me back again

'Cause in Vienna- we were poetry
Yes, in Vienna- love was alive
Watching you watching me
All that our eyes could see
All of the nights
We chased into the dawn
It was the best time of my life

We can't surrender to a feeling
That dance belongs to yesterday
Yet, I still hear Vienna's song

Linda Eder,"The moon is afraid to come out tonight
There'll be no dinners by candlelight,
There is an aura of doom in the air,
And a storm out at sea

Every Picasso tonight is in blue.
The currency's plummeting down in Peru.
And it won't come back
Till you come back to me.

The world's gone mad,
Since we have parted.
And mother nature doesn't like
What she can see.
She's feeling sad, and brokenhearted.
But she'll be feeling better
If you come back to me.

Tonight all the winners have learned
How to lose
Even Tchaikovsky is playin' the blues
And the hole in the sky makes the winter
A balmy one hundred and three.

The poets are striking, but not for the pay
And they won't write, till you come 
Back to me

It's clear to see, we were mistaken
Shakespeare himself
Could not create such tragedy
Don't you agree- fist steps must be taken
But we can fix this mess
When you come back to me

Tonight every song is a bit out of tune
The cow tried to jump
But crashed into the moon
You have to admit it cannot be too soon
Till we're in harmony

For what really matters we never can learn.
Spring will arrive so the birds can return
But they won't come back till you come back
To me
They won't come back till you come back
They're stayin' put till you come back to me

When you're weary, feeling small
When tears are in your eyes,
I will dry them all
I'm on your side
When times get rough
And friends just can't be found

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
When darkness comes
And pain is all around

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

Sail on silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
When you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind

As the stars hang bright, over my head

And my heart pounds strong
Under the covers
And the moon casts long shadows ahead
But I'm in a song only for lovers
In the cool dark night instead

I can hear each promise we've never broken
And each heartfelt moment we'd ever share
Calling somehow
Calling someway

Who cares?
Cause rain or shine or
Any old kind of weather
We have something together
We share

So let's hear those violins
Let the world bread out in silly grins
Then let's fly to the stars up above
Cause when all is said and done
I know you're the only one
So I'm afraid this must be love",I'm Afraid This Must Be Love
Linda Eder,"It's time to hold my hand, and take a chance
It's time to pay the band, and start the dance
We hear the melody, we know the song
It's time I think, we're on the brink
Of waiting far too long

Why not believe our eyes, and cross our hearts?
Dispense with alibis, enough false starts
It's time to put away our childish things
And time to trust in us, and what tomorrow brings

It's time to risk it all, and shoot the moon
So just let go and fall it's not too soon
Before the clock strikes one more chime
Let's see if we can move love off this dime
'Cause when we kiss we both can see, it's time

It's getting too late for a lengthy debate
So let's go for the win
Let's give forever a shove so that love can begin

It's time to let it ride cause time won't wait
If luck is on our side, it's not too late
Before we stumble past our prime
I know together we can make this climb
'Cause I believe for you and me, it's time",It's Time
Linda Eder,"Last tango of the night
Last song of love
Sand melodies take flight
Crying to the heavens above
Don't be afraid, my dear
You're safe with me
I've made a whole career
Out of being who men want me to be
Tonight I'll make your dreams come true
But don't confuse this fire with romance
For I will not remember you
You are just another tango to dance
Now watch the city burn
Here in my eyes
Down here you live and learn
Ask no questions and you hear no lies
Echoes of long ago
Still run through my veins
I had some dreams, you know
But they all got swept away with the rains 
Tonight I'll make your dreams come true
But don't confuse the fire with romance
For I will not remember you
You are just another tango to dance
And there'll always be a tango to dance
For a few pesetas, I'll take you
To paradise
Just a few pesetas can take you
A few pesetas more takes you twice
Tonight I'll make your dreams come true
But don't confuse the fire with romance
For I will not remember you
You are just another tango to dance
And there'll always be a tango to dance",The Last Tango
Linda Eder,"Hear me now oh thou bleak and unbearable world
Thou art base and debauched as can be
And a knight with his banners all bravely unfurled
Now hurls down his gauntlet to thee!

I am I, Don Quixote, the Lord of La Mancha
Destroyer of Evil am I,
I will march to the sound of the trumpets of glory
Forever to conquer or die

Hear me heathens and wizards and serpents of sin
All your dastardly doings are past
For a holy endeavor is now to begin
And virtue shall triumph at last!

I am I, Don Quixote, the Lord of La Mancha
A Name all the world soon will know
And the wild winds of fortune will carry me onward
Oh whither so ever they blow

Whither so ever they blow
Onward to Glory I go!

This night begins to change who we are

Don't turn away its only love
Quietly coming to you
Whispering through you
Take my hand its only love

We can't go back to where we were
Don't be afraid to make it real
Don't be afraid to feel tonight

Only a touch that free's you
Let it release you

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

One time I needed you
In a very unusual way
You were my friend
Maybe it lasted a day
Maybe it lasted an hour
But somehow it will never end

In a very unusual way
I think I'm in love with you
In a very unusual way
I want to cry
Something inside me goes weak
Something inside me surrenders
And you're the reason why, you're the reason why
You don't know what you do to me
You don't have a clue
You can't tell what it's like to be me looking at you
It scares me so that I can hardly speak

In a very unusual way
I owe what I am to you
Though at times it appears I won't stay, I'LL NEVER GO.
Special to me in my life
Since the first day that I met you
How could I ever forget you
Once you had touched my soul

In a very unusual way
You made me whole

Linda Eder,"When autumn comes and leaves obey
I think of you when spring was new
And fall was miles away
And when I close my eyes I see you
And I don't feel the chill
When autumn comes... it's summer still

When autumn comes and wild geese fly
I wonder do you see them too
Across the restless sky
And does October catch you dreaming
Of Central Park in June
Or is love lost beneath the frost 
Of aumtumn's moon

SUmmers by the sea
When the sun would linger till the moon was high
Days of you and me
Underneath a sheltering sky
Did we move too fast for the glow of love to last

When autumn comes and summer goes
I will remember through November
What September knows:
That nothing lasts forever and
Summer love moves on

So when the leaves begin to change
I find it sad but never strange
That you are all I can recall
When autumn comes to call",When Autumn Comes
Linda Eder,"Toss a penny in a well, make a wish, you'll never can tell
Trust your heart and believe come-what-may
'Cause anything can happen if you let it happen
Anything can happen today

Some things you trust, but can't explain
Like finding rainbows after the rain
True romance comes right out of the blue
And anything can happen, if you let it happen
Anything can happen for you

Who knows maybe right around the corner
Your future is waiting for you
Don't be afraid to take a chance
Don't look down each time that you dance
Letting go is the only thing to do
Then anything can happen, if you let it happen
Even love can happen to you
",Anything Can Happen
Linda Eder,"Even now...I remember all the empty spaces
You filled with love
Even now...Every corner of the world we shared
Is still filled with love
Even now...not a day goes by
When I don't ache for you
Through my tears I still hear your laughter even now

Stars still shine bright when they're gone
Hearts that break will still beat on
Letting gos the hardest thing to do
Cause all those feelings start
And time can't change my heart
It all leads back to you

Even now...you are in my dreams and in my dreams
You always will be
Even now...You're the one true thing that brings my heart
Back home to me
When I'm scared...I can close my eyes
You are there...Ever young
And somehow, I can always find you even now

From all the memories kept inside
To all the dreams we knew, the rush of you
Will always be a part of me

Even now...you are in my dreams and in my dreams
You always will be

Even now...in my darkest night
Still you shine silver light

Linda Eder,"Tropic days turn into steamy nights
Stateside ways give in to appetites
Panatelas under white straw hats
Sit and soak, Rum and Coke

Cuban rhythms push the night along
Past the limits of what's right or wrong
Hardly anyone is keepin' score
Let it ride, por favor

Love is the one legal tender
Never in short supply
Just find yourself a big spender
Who will render the gender you'd like to try

Big casinos under Latin skies
Valentinos with ambitious eyes
Slow degrees of lady Fahrenheit
Cook the day, eat the night

Smell the money when the trade winds blow
Play the slot machines, enjoy the show
Spin the wheel or maybe roll the dice
Welcome to Paradise

Too much is never enough here
There's always room for more
One of a kind calls your bluff here
If your pair isn't brass better pass Senor

Twenty-three or so degrees
Just below the Florida keys
All the tourists come to play
Making mucho machismo like Hemingway

Inhibitions simply melt away
Dispositions will improve, they say
Maybe it's the voodoo latitude
Gives the place attitude

Way down here we always oversleep
Way down here we mambo all night long

Linda Eder,"I want you, what can I say?
I'm undeniably, reliably sincere that way
I need you, I must confess
The heart and soul of you the whole of you

And nothing less
'Cause when I'm near you
You pop the top off my thermostat
I guess I love you, baby, that's that

Why fight it, what can I do?
I am pathetically, genetically disposed to you
So take me, m heart's aflame
I'll be like Juliet who can't forget old what's his name

You may be crazy
Foolish, illogical take your pick
But, baby, you are my lunatic

I guess I love you, even though I confess
You are the sixth or seventh such guess
At last, success

I guess I love you, you have become my vice
Bring on the shoes and start throwin' rice
You're paradise go figure, who could have guessed
I'd be so franticly, romantically by you possessed

This parlay just might come in
The odds are good, that knock on wood
This time we're gonna win, 'cause when you kiss me
You kick my ticker to heart attack
I guess I love you, no turning back

I guess I love you like Santa loves his sled
Like 'Blue Eyes' said, ""You go to my head""
'Specially in bed

I want you, haven't you heard
I'm exponentially, essentially, oh, what's the word?
I need you, will I let go?
I'll be redundantly redundant no, no, no, no, no

'Cause since I found you
My life is one sappy, happy mess
How do I want you? How do I need you?
How do I love you? Just guess
",I Guess I Love You
Linda Eder,"I've been a little reluctant to share my feelings out loud
I've never done well addressing a crowd
But love can't live in shadows
That's not what love's about
It's time romance in the closet came out

Call the times with the news
Tell them ""Boys, stop the presses
I've got a headline for you""
Just say: ""I certify there's a guy whose love is true""

Tell the ships out at sea not to send S.O.S's
Everything's finally okay
I'm content with a gent who has sent the clouds away
Climb the highest church steeple and tell all the folks
I have what they're down on their knees for
I love you and it's no secret anymore

Tell Dear Abbey to write what she wants, it won't matter
Because I don't need advice
What you've got is too hot for me not to roll the dice

Let the rumors go wild, let the gossips just chatter
And let the scandal commence
We'll just tell them we fell and to hell with common sense

Take a deep breath and sing it all over the place
Then breathlessly whisper the encore
I love you and it's no secret anymore

I've always played love too close to the vest
Trying to hide it somehow
Acting as if I was under arrest till now

Put a sign in Times Square
Get an internet address
Baby dot com turtledove
Ring a bell, start to yell
But just tell them we're in love

Get a billboard and paint it a hundred feet high
Tell all the world what they're in for
You're the man that I simply adore
I love you and it's no secret anymore",It's No Secret Anymore
Linda Eder,"It's the whisper of the rain when we're sleeping
The familiar way the scent of you clings
In the coolness of the night
It's the little things

It's the honest way you ask how I'm feeling
And the way you still agree though I'm wrong
It's the little things in life
That carry me along

And it's the peace that I find
When it all slows down
And I feel something in the air
Keeps me from losing my mind

In this crazy world
When there's some little thing to share
'Cause all alone here with you
The little things will do
Everyone's always reaching for brass rings

As for me, I'm content with the view
When the afternoon shadows play
With the breezes at end of day
There is nothing I need to say

Let the fireworks start, let the band begin
Those things don't really matter at all
'Cause when the crowds all go home
And I look within, the extravagant gestures seem small

It's not castles and kings
It's the little things
It's not castles and kings
It's the little things
It's the whisper of the rain when we're sleeping
",Little Things
Linda Eder,"George Washington began a revolution
Which started something called the Constitution
Then all those pioneers with resolution
Progressed...Due West

There's always someone finding a beginning
An Eve to tempt poor Adam into sinning
A doubleday to say: three outs per inning
That's all...Play ball

I was all through with romance
Figured love was kaput
No more pretending, no happy ending
Then like a bolt from the blue
You walked into my life
Clever and charming, slightly alarming
Just when I thought that my love life was all past tense
Suddenly you start making sense

I was prepared to simply call it a day
Ready for love to turn the lights out
Then all my reasons found your rhyme
In the nick of time
Looks like you started something now I wasn't ready for this
Was content all alone
Studio flat, sir, maybe a cat, sir
Hey, this is now that was then
I'm in business again
Using your razor, driving your blazer
Just when I thought my libido was fireproof
You fan my flames right through the roof

You are the lightening striking Ben Franklin's kite
You are the Kitty-Hawk of romance
You are Columbus setting out
'Cause without a doubt
Looks like you started somethin' now

I sense a brand new beginning
Something akin to break of day
You are the start of a new career
You're the crowing of Chanticleer
Saying: ""Wake up and smell the coffee""

I don't know where we're going or for how long
So I'll rely on fundamentals:
'Cause if a kiss is still a kiss
Let's not finish this
Looks like you started somethin'...
You really started something'...
Looks like you started somethin' now!

Linda Eder,"One night in Rio I'll never forget
Rhythms of life so wild and so wet
Suddenly out of the darkness he came
Somehow he knew my name

There in the streets in the carnival roar
He whispered come dance with me
Something inside me like never before
Played such a strange melody and I'll

Never dance the way that he moved me
Never kiss the way that he kissed me
Never love the way that he loved me
How can I dance now?
Never knew the heat of desire
Never knew the flames could go higher
Never felt the passion, the fire
Now let me dance again

There in his eyes I was lost from the start
Under his spell, losing my heart
Percussion and thunder collided that night
Painting the sky with light

Out of control going out of my mind
I've never felt so free
I left the dancer and Rio behind
But I found the gypsy in me and I'll

Never dance the way that he moved me
Never kiss the way that he kissed me
Never love the way that he loved me

You're so unique I find, so well designed
That every single thing about you
Reminds me of only you

You never remind me of summers in Spain
The sun when it's setting, the sound of the rain
New years with Dick Clark or Park Avenue

You never remind me of Sir Lancelot
My memory of him is totally shot
King Midas touch, not much next to you

'Cause if the truth be known when we're alone
Then every single thing about you
Reminds me of only you

You never remind me of Gods that are Greek, my dear
And though I may hang on each word that you speak, it's clear
Ahead and behind me I lose track of all events
And as a consequence you are my present tense

You never remind me of anyone who
Reminds me of anyone other than you
Compare though I will, I still can't equate

I thought I understood the reason
For all the parties and caroling

Every time I'd dress the tree
Each new ornament and garland
Each decoration was all I'd see
And all that Christmas meant to me Then someone told me Christmas is for children
And I left that behind too long ago
But now I see Christmas through a child's eyes
My new son's eyes

Now every time we ring in the season
And play a Christmas melody
I know that the moment he hears it
He'll bring Christmas back to me

Linda Eder,Traditional,Silent Night
Linda Eder,"I started out the way most do, running on imagination
Out into a world that I was sure I knew
Add a dose of reality and a little desperation
I became a stranger in a stranger land

Wherever I go, whatever I see, I still can feel the child carry me
High on an ocean of innocence 'cause somewhere between
The truth and the dream, there is a moment in time
When you can touch what you left behind

Across the water, across the water
Across the water, on a little higher ground

And so it goes with everyone, we're not really all that different
The older that we get, it seems the less we know
We mortals all immortalize, after we apologize for
All the things we should have said or could have done

Wherever I go, whatever I see, I still can feel the child carry me
High on an ocean of innocence 'cause somewhere between
The truth and the dream, there is a moment in time
When you can touch what you left behind

Across the water, across the water
Across the water, on a little higher ground

The way we were, the dreams we had, don't ever really die
They watch us from a distance as we wave goodbye
But now and then a backward glance, reminds us that there's
Still a chance, so we fill our sails and travel on across the water

Every day in every life is open to interpretation
Thinkin' about what might have been is a waste of time
I don't need to analyze all my little contradictions
As long as I can find my way back home again

Across the water, across the water
Across the water, on a little higher ground
",Across the Water
Linda Eder,"Day after day I'm more confused
So I look for the light in the pouring rain
You know that's a game that I hate to lose
I'm feelin' the strain, ain't it a shame

Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

Beginning to think that I'm wastin' time
I don't understand the things I do
The world outside looks so unkind
I'm countin' on you to carry me through

And when my mind is free
You know a melody can move me
And when I'm feelin' blue
The guitar's comin' through to soothe me
Thanks for the joy that you've given me
I want you to know I believe in your song
Rhythm and rhyme and harmony
You help me along makin' me strong",Drift Away
Linda Eder,"Everybody needs to be with somebody
Even after all the cold hard facts are known
Like your heart will probably break
What with all that give and take
Still you just can't seem
To leave the thing alone

So you hold your breath
And you count to ten
And you're scared to death
But you close your eyes
And fall in love again
'Cause in the middle of the night
He'll hold you tight
And then everything that's wrong
Will be alright

Now you swear you'll keep romance
In perspective
But, with love,
It's always famine or it's feast
And a hungry heart forgets
Tends to minimize regrets
So as sure as there's
A sunrise in the east
There's a silver moon
That your heart can't waste
And then pretty soon,
There's a stranger's kiss
That you can't wait to taste
'Cause when the apple is in sight
You take a bite
Hopin' everything that's wrong
Will be alright
Maybe this time jealousy and fear
Will get the best of you
Maybe this time you will give a little more
Maybe this time you will look
And find somebody who
Isn't quite as crazy as those times before

So you try again
'Till you get it right
And you never know when to let it go
Or when to hold on tight
But when there's nothin' else that works
Well, love just might
So when romance comes along
We all struggle to belong
So that everything that's wrong
Will be alright

",Everything That's Wrong
Linda Eder,"There's something in your eyes
I should have seen
Something there that doesn't quite belong
And there's something in the way
You touched my hand
I feel the tenderness but somethings wrong

How could I have been so blind
I thought this love would never die
Now baby try....

To break it to me gently
Let me down easy
I don't think I can take 
Much more then that tonight
So let me catch my breath before you start
Then break it to me gently
Even if it gently breaks my heart

You caught me by surprise 
I'm unprepared
Tell what am I supposed to do
I can't find any words
I just know that I'm scared
I never thought of me with out you

And I don't want a reason why
But if you have to say good-bye
Then baby try.....

To break it to me gently
Let me down easy
I don't think I can take 
Much more then that tonight
So let me catch my breath before you start
Then break it to me gently
Even if it gently breaks my heart

Tell me lies
Tell me there's still time for us
Oh can't we try to find a little more time for us
A little time before you....

To break it to me gently
Let me down easy
I don't think I can take 
Much more then that tonight
So let me catch my breath before you start
Then break it to me gently
Even if it gently breaks my heart",Gently Break My Heart
Linda Eder,"I wonder if when all is done
Anyone heard my voice
But from the start we have no choice
Our journeys just begin

I'll never know if I was right
Did I fight hard enough?
When the battles grew too rough
Should I have given in?

But here I stand and swear to you
I did the best that I could do...

I know my voice was just a whisper
But someone may have heard
There were nights the moon above me stirred,
And let me grab a hold
My hands have touched the gold

My hearts been driven by extremes
Blind with dreams, tight with fear
But still God knows that I was hear
And I was so alive

And now I lay the past to rest
For in the end I did my best

You have to live the life you're given
And never close your eyes
You hold on, and stare into the sky,
And burn against the cold
For any moment, you might find the gold!

And there was joy
Through it all
And I am standing tall

I know my voice was just a whisper
But someone must have heard
There were nights the moon above me stirred,
And let my light take hold
I'd rode across that sky
And once I touched the gold

Here in my own two hands
I once had the gold",Gold
Linda Eder,"On Las Cuevas Boulevard
There she works her fingers hard
Playing castanets and swaying
To a steel drum in the dark
She wears flowers in her hair
Sings calypso in the square
People calling out the windows
To the gypsy girl down there

All day long
She waits for
Him to come
And night to fall

She goes
Underneath the colored lights
Where the carnival is flashing bright
The boulevard, just heating up
Her gypsy heart

There he waits beneath the stars
On Las Cuevas Boulevard
She falls into her lover's arms
Sweet gypsy heart

Like a satellite they spin
Her gold scarf against his skin
Her toes tapping on the table
Like she's dancing just for him

Red maracas in his hand
He lifts her up then back again
Turning 'round and 'round in circles
To the rhythm of the band Just until
The sun comes up
Just until
She's had enough

She goes
Underneath the colored lights
Where the carnival is flashing bright
The boulevard, just heating up
Her gypsy heart

There he waits beneath the stars
On Las Cuevas Boulevard
She falls into her lover's arms
Sweet gypsy heart

All day long
She waits for
Him to come
And night to fall

She goes
Underneath the colored lights
Where the carnival is flashing bright
The boulevard, just heating up
Her gypsy heart

She goes
Underneath the colored lights
Where the carnival is flashing bright
The boulevard, just heating up
Her gypsy heart

Linda Eder,"I was so sure
Of every step I took
I never thought to look
At all the other roads
Or to wonder where they lead
I didn't think
That there was much I lacked
I had it all, in fact
I had convinced myself
There is no one that I need

How in the world did I miss
This feeling
How in the world it pass me by
How in the world did your kiss
Completely change the world for me
How in the world did this bliss escape me
And all this passion I can't deny
How in the world did it take me
All this time to clearly see
That you are my world All of my life

I thought I had it good
I thought I understood
All that the heart could know
And all that love could be
I was content
And never wished for more
My heart had locked it's door
I wasn't ready for
This gift you gave to me

How in the world did I miss
This feeling
How in the world it pass me by
How in the world did your kiss
Completely change the world for me
How in the world did this bliss escape me
And all this passion I can't deny
How in the world did it take me

That you are my world",How in the World
Linda Eder,"Just when I'm sure that I've got it all down
Somethin' jumps up and spins me around
Sometimes it's the light from my little boy's eyes
Takin' me by surprise

I've been to the city and I've been to the zoo
Learned all about monkey-see, monkey-do
Somewhere between the false and the true
We all compromise

But you and I broke every rule that they ever made
Don't ask why love is a chance that you take
And like leaves in the wind at the mercy of whither we blow
How little we know

I have seen the northern lights on a winter's day
Up in Minnesota people like it that way
So much in nature I don't understand
It's a mystery not a plan

Lookin' for answers is goin' nowhere fast
Everything's forever but nothin' seems to last
Come tomorrow, today will be the past
Like waves upon the sand

You and I broke every rule that they ever made
Don't ask why love is a chance that you take
And like leaves in the wind at the mercy of whither we blow
How little we know

And in the end what matters most
Is how the heart will rise
And see us through the dramas till we realize
How little we know

You and I broke every rule that they ever made
Don't ask why love is a chance that you take
And like leaves in the wind at the mercy of whither we blow
How little we know

Linda Eder,"Long ago and far away
Before the world had come to this
I took for granted how my life would be
Assuming that my freedom would be free

Before these evening shadows fell
I reveled in the light of day
I rarely ever cried, my patience wasn't tried
And heroes never died

But if I had my way
Things would be different
Danger wouldn't come from a sky of blue
Choices would be clear

And strangers would be kinder
Love a little blinder
As it saved the day
If I had my way

Every now and then it seems
We live our lives to such extremes
Racing all around, never homeward bound
Losing what we've found

But if I had my way
Things would be different
No one would believe that a lie was true
Choices would be clear

And wisdom would be heeded
Warnings never needed
This is what I'd pray
If I had my way

The milk of human kindness
Would seek us out and find us
And color all the words we say

And hearts would come alive
Instead of breaking
No one would believe that a lie was true
Angels would appear

Children would be cherished
Hope would never parish
Faith would not betray
If I had my way
",If I Had My Way
Linda Eder,"As we turn our lives
Down this complicated road
If you need a hand to hold
I promise you

I will be your friend
Through whatever life may send
And I know that you will be there too
If I should lose my way

Along this road we share
Please bring me home, come-what-may
If I should lose my way
When the wild wind blows

And the rain begins to fall
I will find you through it all
And comfort you
But as we move on

Should you turn and find me gone
Then just rest awhile, I'll be along If I should lose my way
Along this road we share
Please wait for me, come-what-may

If I should lose my way
Day after day,
Never let the sun go down
'Til love is found once more

If I should lose my way
Along this road we share
Please look for me, come-what-may
If I should lose my way

Please look for me...

Linda Eder,"Jimmy Ray was a preacher's son
When his daddy would visit he'd come along
When they gathered 'round the parlor talkin'
Cousin Jimmy would take me walkin'

Out through the backyard we'd go walkin'
And then he'd look into my eyes

Linda Eder,"I reserve the right for once in my life
To lay down in a field of grass
I'll be still and quiet
Just count the stars
From here to Mars
I will hold my breath

Until I don't care
Until I am sure
Until I am strong just like before
I will lie beneath the sky

Until the stars refuse to shine
And the moon won't come at night
I won't cry, just close my eyes

Just to stand beside your flame

So cry no more on the shore
A dream will take us out to sea
Forever more, forever more

Close your eyes and dream and you can be with me
'Neath the waves through the caves of hours
Long forgotten now
We're all alone, we're all alone

Close the window, calm the light
And it will be all right, no need to bother now
Let it out, let it all begin
Learn how to pretend

Once a story's told it can't help but grow old
Roses do, lovers too
So cast your seasons to the wind
And hold me dear, oh, hold me dear

Close the window, calm the light
And it will be all right, no need to bother now
Let it out, let it all begin, all's forgotten now
We're all alone, we're all alone

Close the window, calm the light
And it will be all right, no need to bother now
Let it out, let it all begin, all's forgotten now

Linda Eder,"To dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go
To right the unrightable wrong
To love pure and chaste from afar
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star
This is my quest
To follow that star
No matter how hopeless
No matter how far
To fight for the right
Without question of pause To be willing to march
Into hell for a heavenly cause
And I know if I'll only be true
To this glorious quest
That my heart will be peaceful and calm
When I'm laid to my rest
And the world will be better for this
That one man scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable star!



",The Impossible Dream [From Man of La Mancha]
Linda Eder,"A new life, what I wouldn't give
To have a new life
One thing I have learned as I go through life
Nothing is for free along the way

A new start, that's the thing I need
To give me new heart
Half a chance in life to find a new part
Just a simple role that I can play

A new hope, something to convince me
To renew hope
A new day, bright enough to help me
Find my way

A new chance, one that maybe has
A touch of romance
Where can it be
The chance for me?

A new dream, I have one I know
That very few dream
I would like to see that overdue dream
Even though it never may come true

A new love though I know
There's no such thing as true love
Even so although I never knew love
Still I feel that one dream is my due

A new world, this one thing I want
To ask of you world
Once before it's time to say adieu, world
One sweet chance to prove the cynics wrong

A new life more and more I'm sure
As I go through life, just to play the game
And to pursue life, just to share it's pleasures and belong
That's what I've been here for all along
Each day's a brand new life

Just as real as can be, Papa
There I was in Mr. Orpheum's office
And he was saying to me
""Rose, get yourself some new orchestrations
New routines and red velvet curtains
Get a feathered hat for the baby
Photographs in front of the theater
Get an agent and in jig time
You'll be being booked in the big time!""

They'll be no dinners by candlelight

And a storm out at sea

Every Picasso tonight is in blue
The currency is plummeting down in Peru
And it won't come back
'Til you come back to me

The world's gone mad
Since we have parted
And mother nature doesn't like
What she can see

She's feeling sad
And brokenhearted
But she'll be feeling better
If you come back to me

Tonight all the winners have learned how to lose
Even Chikofsky is playin' the blues
And the hole in the sky
Makes the winter a balmy 103

The papers are sayin' that love is passe
Oh, it's so striking but not for the pay
They won't write
'Til you come back to me

It's clear to see
We were mistaking
Shakespeare himself could not
Create such tragedy

Don't you agree
The first steps must be taken?
But we can fix this mess
When you come back to me

Tonight every song is a bit out of tune
The cow tried to jump but crashed into the moon
You have to admit it cannot be too soon
'Til we're in harmony

For what really matters, we never can learn
Spring will arrive so the birds can return
But they won't come back
'Til you come back to me

They won't come back
'Til you come back to me
They're staying put
'Til you come back to me

Tonight every song is a bit out of tune
The cow tried to jump but crashed into the moon
You have to admit it cannot be too soon
'Til we're in harmony

For what really matters, we never can learn
Spring will arrive so the birds can return
But they won't come back
'Til you come back to me

They won't come back
'Til you come back to me
They're staying put
'Til you come back to me

Come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me

Linda Eder,"If he never said hello
If his eyes had never smiled at me
What did he find inside my heart
That made him take a chance
Did he know what I was feeling
Could it be that he was lonely
Something between us had begun
Something so beautiful
Something that's started with hello
Now memories are filling me with pictures of the past
Foolish me hoping love would last
And even now I still can feel
The way he looked at me
The way he looked at me
If he never said I love you
If he never said forever
I would have never known love
If he never said hello
I'll never know goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye",If He Never Said Hello
Linda Eder,"It's not a whispered word or a pretty phrase
It's not a touch it's not a gaze
It's not how we hold on but how we grow
It's standing by and letting go

It's not the beauty of making someone yours
Love sets us free
Loves opens doors
Love sends move on

Stand on your own
Love knows when someone else meets to rise and walk along
Life pass the change
Don't wonder why

He needs to feel the light of the open sky
If we hold on too tight
How can a dream take flight
Open your arms

And let him fly
It's not just pulling someone very near
It's having faith instead of fear
You can't hold someone back when his dream calls

Love is a hole that has no walls
Yes he may disappear
There's no way to know
You take that chance
You let him go

[Chorus]

Go find your dream
Be who you are
I want much for you
Than I wish upon a star

Move from my side
I will not cry
If you remember me
Love can never die

Love lets the life break through
Now love will help me too
Open my arms and let him fly
It's not it's not goodbye

Someday you'll fly high

[Chorus]",Let Him Fly
Linda Eder,"I try my best to live a good life
Walk down that straight and narrow street
My Mama told me go to live right
Beware the strangers that you meet
But she never, ever laid her eyes on you
If she did, she'd know it's true

[Chorus]
I resist temptation when he's knocking at my door
Got no time for trouble keep away
But I've got one big trouble
And I don't know what to do
I've got one bad habit, you

I saw you coming from the distance
Like a falling dollar bill
You're thinking woman's not mad
I think I want you think I will
When my mind leaves, when you smile, my body wants to stay
What can I do, what can I say

[Chorus]

And I go, oh no every time you're near
My resistance disappears
You play me, sting me, turn me upside down
God knows why I stick around

[Chorus]

I gave up lying, staying up too late
I gave up on [unknown]
But I got one big trouble
And I don't know what to do

I've got one bad habit, you
I gave up drinking, smoking cigarettes
And I gave up placing ???
But I got one big trouble

And I don't know what to do
I've got one bad habit, you

I gave up laughing on the wind

But I got one big trouble
And I don't know what to do

Linda Eder,"Listen to me, I have beautiful dreams I can spin you,
Dreams to linger within you,
Close your eyes and we'll ride my carousel.
I'll sing you stories of 

Lovers whose love used 
To fill me.
And the lovers who will be. 
For, you see, love is one thing I do well.

Come let's believe love can be just as sweet as it seems.
Let's live on dreams...
In my dreams such beautiful lovers have found me.
Story book lovers surround me. 

Nothing is real, but I'm flying,
Sighing: Where, where, where is my story book
Ending?
Why does my golden pretending

Leave me with nothing to hold...but
My dreams?
Oh is it only in dreams that we find out ideal love?
Are there lovers with real love? 

If you know how to feel love, show me how.
Ah, but my prince, if you can't be as sweet as you seem, 
I'd rather dream!
Come and wake me! Come be the love I can hold now.

Storybook love leaves me cold now.
Show me the way to stop dreaming! 
There is only one perfect story book ending. 
That is the end of pretending. 
That is the moment I say: Love me now! 

Et sur mon manege, l'amour toujours est chantant. 
Des mes reves, see'est le commencement,
Et j'espere une fine heureuse.

Certes je n'embrasse que mes reves, seuls mes reves!",Storybook
Linda Eder,"When I Look At You
When I look at you
What I always see
Is the face of someone else
Who once belonged to me
Still I can hear him laugh
Even though that melody plays on
He's gone

When I look at you
He is standing there
I can almost breathe him in
like summer in the air
Why do you smile his smile
That heaven I'd forgotten eases through
In you

If you could look at me once more
With all the love you felt before
If you and I could only dance into the past
And find that love we knew
I'll never take my eyes away from you

When I look at you
He is touching me
I would reach for him
But who can hold a memory?
And love isn't everything
This moonlight on the bed will melt away someday

Oh, you were once that someone
Who I followed like a star
And suddenly you changed
And now I don't know who you are
Or could it be that I never really knew you from the start

Did I create a dream
Was he a fantasy
Even a memory is a paradise for all the fools like me
Now remembering is all that I can do
Because I miss him so

Linda Eder,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away

Pictures of another time
From the corner of a small cafe

Come on girls
You believe in love
'Cause I've got something to sing about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart but
He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Linda Eder,"The party's over, the game is ended, 
the dreams I dreamed went up in smoke.
They didn't pan out as I had intended; 
I should know how to take a joke.

I'll go my way by myself, this is the end of romance. 
I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance. 
I'll try to apply myself and teach my heart to sing. 
I'll go my way by myself like a bird on the wing,
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.
I'll go my way by myself, here's how the comedy ends. 
I'll have to deny myself love and laughter and friends.
Grey clouds in sky above have put a blot on my fun.

Linda Eder,"I peer through windows
watch life go by.
Dream of tomorrow
and wonder why
the past is holding me
keeping life at bay.
I wander lost in yesterday.
Wanting to fly
but scared to try.
But if someone like you
found someone like me
then suddenly
nothing would ever be the same.
My heart would take wing and I'd feel so alive
If someone like you found me.
So many secrets
I long to share.
All I have needed 
is someone there.
To help me see a world
I've never seen before.
A love to open every door.
To set me free,
so I can soar.
But if someone like you
found someone like me
then suddenly 
nothing would ever be the same.
There'd be a new way to live
a new life to love.
If someone like you found me.
But if someone like you
found someone like me
then suddenly
nothing would ever be the same.
My heart would take wing and I'd feel so alive
If someone like you loved me
loved me
loved me.

And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere

When every fairy tale comes real

Linda Eder,"There's a letter on the desktop that I dug out of a drawer
The last truce we ever came to in our adolescent war
And I start to feel the fever from the warm air through the screen
You come regular like seasons shadowing my dreams

And the Mississippi's mighty but it starts in Minnesota
At a place that you could walk across with five steps down
And I guess that's how you started like a pinprick to my heart
Now you rush right through me and I start to drown

And there's not enough room in this world for my pain
Signals cross and love gets lost and time passed makes it plain
Of all my demon spirits I need you the most
I'm in love with your ghost

Dark and dangerous like a secret that gets whispered in a hush
When I wake the things I dreamt about you last night makes me blush
And you kiss me like a lover then you sting me like a viper
I go follow to the river play your memory like a piper

And I feel it like a sickness how this love is killing me
I'd walk into the fingers of your fire willingly
And that's the edge of sanity, I've never been this close
I'm in love with your ghost, I'm in love with your ghost

Unknowing captor, you never know how much you
Pierce my spirit but I can't touch you
Can you hear it, a cry to be free?
I'm forever under lock and key as you pass through me

Now I see your face before me, I would launch a thousand ships
To bring your heart back to my island as the sand beneath me slips
As I burn up in your presence and I know now how it feels
To be weakened like Achilles with you always at my heels

This bitter pill I swallow is the silence that I keep
It poisons me, I can't swim free, the river is too deep
Though I'm baptized by your touch, I am no worse than most
I'm in love with your ghost, I'm in love with your ghost
I'm in love with your ghost, I'm in love with your ghost",Ghost

Linda Feller,"Ich war seid fast acht Stunden schon auf der Autobahn 
War ganz kurz vor meinem Ziel und hielt mich mächtig ran 
Die Sonne sie stand schon sehr tief als ich zur Ausfahrt kam 
Der Diesel dröhnte neben mir mein Funkgerät war an 
Als daraus die Stimme eines kleinen Jungen kam 
Er sagte nur Kanal 14 ist hier irgendwer? Wenn dann ruf 
Mich doch zurück und sprich mit Teddybär 
Bis zur Stadt war’s nicht mehr weit ich kam ganz gut voran 
Ich nahm das Mikro in die Hand und sagte ganz spontan 
Hey ich rufe Teddybär wo ist der junge Mann? Ich bin auf 
Deiner Welle kannst du mich verstehen? 
Es wurde still auf dem Kanal ich wollt schon weiterdrehen 
Da fragte mich der Junge Fahrer bist du auch noch dran? 
Ich sagte JA und da fing er mir zu erzählen an 
Jeden Tag von früh bis spät schalt ich den Kasten ein 
Sitz im Rollstuhl kann nicht gehen und bin hier ganz allein 
Und meine Mutter arbeitet sie sagt dass muss so sein 
Denn Daddy starb vor einem Jahr auf dieser Autobahn 
Er war ein Fahrer so wie Du bis er dann nicht mehr kam 
Sie sagt mir oft wir schaffen es und tut als wenn nichts wär 
Doch jede Nacht hör ich sie weinen Ich weiß sie hat’s sehr schwer 
Und während er so redete da fiel es mir doch auf 
Kein anderer war zu dieser Zeit auf Kanal 14 drauf 
Er sagte Dieses Funkgerät von Daddy gehört jetzt mir 
Es ist der schönste Zeitvertreib mit einem so wie dir 
Auch Daddy sprach von unterwegs genauso wie jetzt du 
Und eines Tages sagte er mein Junge hör mir zu einmal

Da nehm ich dich mit raus doch leider Wurde nichts mehr raus 
Ich hörte die Enttäuschung die aus diesen Worten Klang 
Ich war längst stehngeblieben das packte mich doch an 
Denn all das ging mir zu Herzen Ich pfiff auf Job und Zeit 
Alle konnten warten nur dieser Junge nicht tut mir leid 
Ich sagte Teddybär wo wohnst du wo liegt deine Station? 
Was ich zu tun hatte dass wusste ich längst schon 
Nur dieser kleine Funker der ahnte nichts davon 
Er gab mir die Adresse sagte lebe wohl und 
Irgendwann vielleicht bist du wieder hier dann wär es schön 
Wenn mich dein Ruf erreicht 
Dann war es Still und ich gab Gas Mit 80 in die Stadt 
Die letzte Kurve ich war da Ich glaubte nicht was ich da sah 
Da standen 18 LKWs Ich war den Tränen nah 
Sie hatten alles mitgehört und fuhrn ihn hin und her 
Ja einer nach dem andren fuhr eine Runde mit Teddybär 
18 mal die Straße runter und 18 mal auch rauf 
Ich war ganz als letzter dran und trug ihn auch wieder hinauf 
Ich hab noch nie ein Kind gesehen dass so restlos glücklich war 
Und seine Augen strahlten es war einfach wunderbar 
Er sagte Fahrer glaube mir dass war eine Schau 
Ich fang dich wieder einmal ein dass weiß ich ganz genau 
Und er hielt meine Hand die ganze Zeit schon 
Ich schluckte und sagte Ist schon gut mein Sohn 
Dann fuhr ich los und mein Gerät dass war noch auf Empfang 
Als auf einmal die Stimme einer Frau erklang Sie sagte 
Und man merkte es das Sprechen fiel ihr schwer 
Hier ist Kanal 14 hier spricht Mutter Teddybär 
Den schönsten Tag in seinem Leben habt ihr meinem Kind gegeben 
Niemals mehr kann ich vergessen wie ihr zu meinem Jungen ward 
Ich danke euch 
Und allzeit gute Fahrt",Ruf Teddyb채r Eins-Vier
Linda Foster,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

You know it takes a lot of kissin'  (Tell me about it)

"" You're back in my spot again, honey""
""I like your spot""
 To stay away from you
""I can't stay away from you""
 It takes more than a lifetime, daddy, to prove that I'll be true

But, it takes somebody special   ""Like me, baby""
To make me say, ""I do.""

Playin' them guitars like shootin from a gun
Keepin' up the rhythm, steady as a clock

Some say it came from Memphis down in Tennessee
Or it drifted in from Georgia about 1953

As long as it's pumpin' honey, it's gonna last

Through the Carolinas on them dirt red roads
Burnin like a fire runnin' wild in the woods
From Arkansas to Texas, it sounds so good

Playin' them guitars like shootin from a gun

Take a ride down the river, you'll see just what I mean

Well money can buy me a hell of a lot
But it sure won't buy me love 
Well I brought me a car

And he took my savings
He took the train

Can't deny the joy it brings

But like a drug that makes you blind
It'll fool ya every time

The trouble with love is
It can tear you up inside
Make your heart believe a lie
It's stronger than your pride
The trouble with love is
It doesn't care how fast you fall
And you can't refuse the call
See you've got no say at all

Now I was once a fool it's true
I played the game by all the rules
But now my world's a deeper blue
I'm sadder but I'm wiser too

I swore I'd never love again
I swore my heart would never mend
Said love wasn't worth the pain
But then I hear it call my name

Every time I turn around
I think I've got it all figured out
My heart keep callin'
And I keep on fallin'

It seems no matter what I do
It tears my heart in two

Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

A smiling face, a warm embrace,
Two arms to hold me tenderly.

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

You've been called a hero,
You've been called to bed,
You've been to be-damned
But we'll shake your hand
You're like a paper mountain man

You live ten telephone poles and two trees up a dirt road
Outside the city line
You like delicate ladies with real fine skin
You'll touch 'em
But you'll never love, that's the way you've always been

You've been called a hero,
You've been called to bed,
You've been to be-damned
But we'll shake your hand
You're like a paper mountain man

Heard tell you're half a racoon and half horse trader
Taking time to key your life biased high
You're wearing curly hair, teasing round your ears
With a heavy booted walk tapping low funk blues

You've been called a hero,
You've been called to bed,
You've been to be-damned
But we'll shake your hand
You're like a paper mountain man",Paper Mountain Man
Linda Perry,"Wake me up when
The party's over
It seems I've had too much wine

Please remember
to remind me
If I had a good time

Was I friendly?
Or was I bragging?
And did I start to bore you?

Was I charming?
Or was I absent?
Did I even say goodnight?

[Chorus]
Fill me up lets take a ride
From your mouth into my mind
'Cause I grow weary from this trip I'm on, Yeah
And the ride keeps getting longer

And in morning
I'll be hungover with my face into the phone
Please forgive here on after
By the way how'd I get home?

Was I laughing?
Was I choking?
And did I start to annoy you?

Was I sleazy?
Or was I dazzling?
Did I even say goodbye?

[Chorus x3]

So wake me up when the party's over
I seems I've had too much wine",Fill Me Up
Linda Perry,"Can you see me
In the garden
Watering flowers all night long

Taking care of what you neglected
And I do it with a happy song

Can you feel your guardian angel 
Guiding you so patiently
And you wonder if you're in heaven
'Cause you move so gracefully

Welcome tomorrow
Where we flow us gently

Didn't we know
Didn't we feel it
The time to seems to stop
Outside our window

And we ride, down the freeway
Hoping to express our religion
To be free
Of everything

With my friends, sitting around drinking
Talking about how life is much too long
How some days everything's just so right
And the next day everything just seems so wrong

Laughing while complaining
But having a good time
It didn't really matter

Welcome tomorrow
Where we flow us gently

At two O'Clock in the morning
The lights go on
It's time for us to go

And the last thing I can remember,
Was an angel guiding us right through the door
Yeah, Yeah

Laughing while complaining
But having a good time
It didn't really matter
It really doesn't matter

Welcome tomorrow
Where we flow us gently

Didn't we know
Didn't we feel it
The time to seems to stop
Outside our window

And we ride, down the freeway
Hoping to express our religion

Didn't we know
Didn't we feel it
The time to seems to stop
Outside our window

And we run down the freeway
Didn't we know
Didn't we feel it
How time it seems to stop
Outside our window

And we run, down the freeway
Hoping to express our religion
To be free, Of everyt",Freeway
Linda Perry,"This ain't no walk in park 
But I call it my home 
And you're all invited 

Waking up in the dark 
Knowing I'm not alone 
It's all so familiar 

Got the trees in the sky 
Got the grass in my toes 
I got no tomorrows 

Got the dilated eyes
And a couple No Doze 

It's a happy feeling 
For drag queens 
The speed freaks 
All the homo boys they touch me 
Tainted love 

The park on a Sunday afternoon 
Fruitloop Daydream 
Bring your life in a sack 
You can come with us too 
It's a happy family 

Trade your crack for some crack 
Change your groove for some groove 
It's a poor man's party 

No Dozers 
The posers 
All the rich kids with their candy noses 

Hey mister 
Spare a sister some change

Feeling like a bluebird
Flying away

I love the drops of rain
Smiling on my feathers
Guiding my way

Do, do do do do (x4)
I trip across the air
It's treating me so kindly
So far to go
So I flew unto a tree
Gather inspiration

Linda Perry,"In my daydreams everything's worthwhile
In my daydreams I ran a thousand miles
And everybody worshiped me
In my daydreams
Hate meant just to smile 
And the pain never bothered me
I want everything
Everything I want
There's no room to turn me upside down
In my daydreams
I built my own empire
With no color and no creed
In my day dreams
I'm like a bird in flight
I'm I getting much too deep?
I want everything
Everything I want
There's no room to turn me
Upside down
I want everything, everything I want 
Yeah, yeah
There's no time to turn me upside down

Linda Perry,"Life in a bottle
It feels so comforting
Seems like that's my destiny
Fake what you want
Selective memory
Wrap me up, and set me free

Meet my friend
Held tightly in my hand
Forgetting what I meant to say

Love but to hate
That's just the way it goes
Inch by Inch I sink below

And I love, I love, I love
All my bad company
And I know, I know, I know
that's what's meant to be
So there's nothing let for me to say.

Stoned and demented
Walking through the walls
When I banged my head I slowly fell

Sad but delighted
Swimming in my well
I guess I'm going straight to Hell

And I love, I love, I love
All my bad company
And I know, I know, I know
That's what's meant to be
And I love, I love, I love
All my bad company

So there's nothing let for me to say
No there's nothing let for me to say

Linda Perry,"Have you been told
About the machine man
His leather gloves
Hide his machine hands

In every dream
In sleep I ever had
I am awoke
By the machine man

Have you been told
About the machine man
He watches me
With eyes as cold as sand

And when I sleep
I feel him stroke my hand
I am awoke by the machine man

Linda Perry,"This is not the way it's
Supposed to be
Spend my day in fear of all
It sets me free
I beg your pardon
For what I do and say
I can hold myself to blame
But the sure remains the same
Will success fail me?
Will it make me free?
What they tell me I should want?
Is it what I need?
Hey Mom, hey Dad
The story went
Round the burning wheels of faith
It pays the rent
Hey sister, hey brother
I had to choose
Choose between the win and lose
But what's the use?
Will success fail me?
Will it make me free?
What they tell me I should want?
Is it what I need?
Come March come April
Come May and June
Let the pounding seconds go
There's nothing I can do
Will success fail me?
Will it make me free?
What they tell me I should want?
Is it what I need? (x 2)
Is there something I can do?",Success
Linda Perry,"Woman, how do you feel?
It looks like your gonna cry,
Is everything alright?
Are your days
Dropping you in a hole
No signals no signs
No reasons or rhymes
And just when you thought you'd be down on your knees
I'll say baby come with me please
And we'll just
Fly away
Fly away
Don't you need to get higher
Baby baby baby
I wanna get close to you
But I'm so afraid
Honey, I'm so afraid
That one day you'll wake up and realize your wasting time, your sweet time
When I pick up the phone
You're not alone
And there I'll be standing wondering what's wrong
I'll say oh baby take me along
And we will
Fly away
Fly away
Don't you need to get higher
No no no no
I don't know how you feel
Talk to me baby
Come with me baby
Come with me baby
And we will
Fly away
Fly away
Yes we need to get higher
