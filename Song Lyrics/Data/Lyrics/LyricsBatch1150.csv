Santana,"Since the moment I spotted you
Like walking 'round with little wings on my shoes
My stomach's filled with the butterflies (ooh) and it's alright
Bouncin' round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If I said I didn't like it then you'd know I'd lied

Every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out that everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

So I'll say 'why don't you and I get together and take on the world and be together forever
Heads we will and tails we'll try again
So I say why don't you and I hold each other and fly to the moon and straight on to heaven
Cause without you they're never going to let me in

Whens this fever gonna break?
I think I've handled more than any man can take
I'm like a love-sick puppy chasin' you around
(Ooh)And it's alright
Bouncin round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If I said I didn't like it then you'd know I'd lied

Every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out that everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

So I'll say 'why don't you and I get together and take on the world and be together forever
Heads we will and tails we'll try again
So I say why don't you and I hold each other and fly to the moon and straight on to heaven
Cause without you they're never going to let me in

(Only second time through)
And slowly I begin to realize this is never gonna end
Right about the same time you walk by
And I say 'Oh here we go again' oh

Every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out that everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

So I'll say 'why don't you and I get together and take on the world and be together forever
Heads we will and tails we'll try again
So I say why don't you and I hold each other and fly to the moon and straight on to heaven
Cause without you they're never going to let me in

So I'll say 'why don't you and I get together and take on the world and be together forever

Santana,"Stay with it baby
And that's all I ask of you
And I know that someday
You won't remember
The way that this moment feels to you
Don't let it go
Don't turn your back on what you think you know
You never know you know
Don't leave it alone
'Cause I need you to cling to

'Cause you are my kind
You're all that I want
Here in this life
Until we are gone
Our breath and our skin
Our hearts and our minds
They're one and the same
You are my kind

Well call on me baby
If you should ever need someone
To help get your head straight
I'll be your resident all night
Sure am glad just having you around
All that I know
When you find love you never let it go
You never know you know
Without you I'm lost
I get scattered
I'm shattered

'Cause you are my kind
You're all that I want
Here in this life
Until we are gone
Our breath and our skin
Our hearts and our minds
They're one and the same
'Cause you are my kind
We're one and the same
You are my kind

Don't let it go
Don't turn your back on what you think you know
You never know
Don't leave it alone
'Cause I need you to cling to

'Cause you are my kind
You're all that I want
Here in this life
Until we are gone
Our breath and our skin
And our hearts and our minds
They are one and the same
'Cause you are my kind

Our love and our life
My heart and my soul
Need you tonight
Your love makes me whole
And it's all I can stand
Until you come home
I need you tonight
'Cause you are my kind
I need you tonight
'Cause you are my kind

Oh, oh, oh, oh you are my kind
Oh, oh, oh, oh you are my kind",You Are My Kind

Santana,"It's midnight - And I don't want to see you leaving
Thought of you - going back - back to him - is killing me
Baby please - how can you torture my heart
We both know - where we belong
we belong here in each other's arms

Baby I - I don't want to see you hurting...(no more)

You know that it's right here with me

Verse 1:
Sometimes I wish I knew your name
At times I want to say hello
But you seem so far away
To let my feelings show
And though I don't know what to say
I feel that someday soon one day
Love will place you by my side
And it shall be our guide

Chorus:
And then manana sera se si
Means our love will always be
Something special and also true
Girl I long to be with you
Oh manana sera se si
Means our love will always be
Something special and also true
Girl I long for you

Verse 2:
When I have you by my side
You will always be my pride
Love so simple yet so sweet
I do think you're all I need
So I thought I'd let you know
That my heart forever grows
Closer to your warm embrace
Everytime I see your face

Chorus:
And then manana sera se si
Means our love will always be
Something special and also true
Girl I long to be with you
Oh manana sera se si
Means our love will always be
Something special and also true

Santana,"Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do, about you now

Backbeat, the word was on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I
Would like to say to you but I don't know how

Because maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all, you're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do, about you now

And all the roads that lead you there are winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I
Would like to say to you but I don't know how

I said maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all, you're my wonderwall

I said maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all, you're my wonderwall

I said maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me
you're gonna be the one that saves me
you're gonna be the one that saves me",The Game of Love [Main/Radio Mix]
Santana,"She's a force of nature that I can't outrun
A devil and a savior, all in one
Her eyes can heal me or they can make me bleed
Her lips have me addicted to the poetry

But never really knowing just who I am
And I confess that I don't mind at all
'Cause I would trade the world away to stay inside this dream
I'll never find a better place to fall, no, no

I got a lover, a brown skin girl
She's got a magic of another world
And every time that I think of her, I'm on fire, fire
She knows a way, a spiritual flow
Making me dizzy like a vertigo
Her cinnamon kisses melt my soul like fire, yeah

I get a strong vibration
When she just says my name
And it drives me crazy
'Cause I don't know if she feels the same

But she likes to breathe some mystery in all she does
She laughs and says that I'm under her spell
Now I won't lie, I enjoy the ride and pray it never ends
I feel her deeper than anything I've felt

I got a lover, a brown skin girl
She's got a magic of another world
And every time that I think of her, I'm on fire, fire
She knows a way, a spiritual flow
Making me dizzy like a vertigo
Her cinnamon kisses melt my soul like fire

Oh, I can't help but crave another taste of her
Like a drowning man that's praying for the rain
And how she worked her way inside, I'll never understand
She's too beautiful to ever take the blame
But she'll always fan the flame

My brown skin girl, my brown skin girl

I got a lover, a brown skin girl
She's got a magic of another world
And every time that I think of her, I'm on fire, fire
She knows a way, a spiritual flow
Making me dizzy like a vertigo
Her cinnamon kisses melt my soul like fire, yeah

I got a lover, a brown skin girl
She's got a magic of another world
And every time that I think of her, I'm on fire, fire
She knows a way, a spiritual flow
Making me dizzy like a vertigo
Her cinnamon kisses melt my soul like fire
",Brown Skin Girl
Santana,"Going back to the memories
Reminiscing bout you and me
Thinking how it used to be
It's plain and clear I treated you bad
But girl you know that I care
Every relation have wear and tear
Just draw near girl and try to hear and listen what my heart says

Many days and many nights
Many heartbreaks, many fights
Many wrongs but so many rights
So girl don't let this love die
Never meant to cause you no pain,
Girl I never meant to treat you lame.
Gimme one more chance rewind come back again.
Don't let this love die.

Just cry baby cry (Don't cry no more)
'Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines

Can you feel me reaching out to you girl, can you hear my open thoughts
Never want disrespect you girl don't let this come break us apart.
'Cause I know I would die without you, my girl can you hear my broken heart.
It's calling out to the good times that we had back at the start.

Baby (Don't call me baby)
You know I need you in my life daily (You know you played me)
I was a player but now your love changed me (Dead wrong)
I'm going crazy (I'm gone)
Never thought losing you would be so hard

It's your turn to cry baby cry (Don't cry no more)
'Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines

So let go
And move on
What we were
Is now undone
My tears have all dried
It's your turn now to cry

You're losing your love and your trust for me girl
And you know, I would go to the ends of the world.
If you wanted, just like we started.
Girl 'cause I don't want to fight no more.
Make it like it was before.

I tell you the truth and you cried and I cried
Let's get back to the place and that look in your eyes
Can you feel it inside, no clouds in your skies
The sun is gonna shine

Chat to her Santana

It's your turn to cry baby cry (Don't cry no more)
'Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines

Cry baby, cry (New beginning)
'Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines

Cry baby, cry
'Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines",Cry Baby Cry

But most times I'm just so happy that I ever found you
It's a complicated web
That you weave inside my head
So much pleasure with such pain
I hope we always always stay the same

I'm feeling the way you cross my mind
And you save me in the knick of time
I'm riding the highs, I'm digging the lows
'Cause at least I feel alive
I've never faced so many emotional days
But my, life is good
I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you

You go and then I can finally breathe in
'Cause, baby, I know in the end you'll never leave it

And I can't tell anymore

Part of me says let it go
That life happens for a reason
I don't I don't I don't

Tell me what to do
You know I can't see through the haze around me
And I do anything that just feel better

And I can't find my way
Girl I need a change
And I do anything that just feel better
Any little thing that just feel better

I'm a little far from the shore
And I'm afraid of sinking
You're the only one knows me
And who doesn't ignore
That my soul is weeping

I know I know I know
Part of me says let it go
Everything must have it seasons
Round and round it goes
And every day's a one before
But this time this time

I'm gonna try anything that just feels better
Tell me what to do
You know I can't see through the haze around me
And I do anything that just feel better

And I can't find my way
God I need a change
And I do anything that just feel better
Any little thing that just feel better

Long to hold you in my arms
To all things I ought to leave behind yeah
It's really getting nowhere
I think I need a little help this time

With all of that scratching and biting
So exciting it's frightening
I'm your do-right man and you're my do right not my just for tonight woman
Making me feel just like a baker quick to put something in your oven
Not no dumplin's or no stuffin' but our own lil' flesh and blood'n
A bouncin' lil' baby something pretty girl or handsome son child

Never felt that they would go and now leave you in the dark
You told me that you needed me and I showed you I'd be there
But Now you've got me wrapped up in this crazy love affair

See lately Ive been thinking about he things you do to me
How we been through all this ups and downs and I was to blind to see
But now my visions better and I'm writing you this letter
By the time you get home Ill be gone and my life will be much better

It's hard enough those days these are games that we play

There's one thing I want you to know now before I pack my bags and go
Girl you got it all wrong got it all wrong got it all twisted baby

I gave you everything even gave you my ring
For better or for worse baby gave you my name
Get through every season summer winter spring and fall
And one thing you can say is I was with you through it all
Ill miss your touch, ill miss your ways these games with love that we can't play
I've gotta walk away I've gotta leave so I can find my way to still believe

Cause I love you to much and there's no love with no trust
Theres one thing I want you to know now before I pack my bags and go
Girl you got it all wrong got it all wrong got it all twisted baby
One thing I want you to know now before I pack my bags and go down
Girl you got it all wrong got it all wrong got it all twisted baby

Lethal injection, bitter sweet affection 
All in the wrong direction but we had our connection
Try not to be affected oh but I guess I was
Now I know what my momma meant when she told me bout love
Take your time don't rush in get to close and you'll get burned

Santana,"Well they called the flat plains Kansas a long, long time ago
When they'd seen the gates of glory and the fire down below
The many great decisions of the people in this place 
You could tell the strength within them, you could see it their face

Well it's been 9 or 10 years since I started my ramblin' round
And from hand to mouth I was livin' playing every bar in town
Though a dollar a day didn't go too far I could never deny my pride
I couldn't lay back and be taken care of while the world went by outside 

So I went to school to learn but I didn't like what they'd teach
And I went to church to pray but I didn't like what they'd preach 
I was hard-headed, young and angry, and I felt I could take the heat 
And I had to find out my own way how to live out on the street 

So I packed my bags and I left here to peruse the streets alone 
And I saw that side of midnight where the beggars howl and groan 
Places filled with desperation where the future ain't so bright 
But I remember back in Kansas when we sang a song at night 

We sang every step of the way 
Though your dreams can be real don't let them slip slide away 
Doesn't matter at all, let them do as they will 
Someday you'll hear them call for you

Goin'  around and round from town to town I tried to make my way 
I believed that all my searching and struggling would payoff bug some day 
As a teenager I was rowdy and I played for good and bad
Though I knew my songs had meaning at times it made me mad

And I'd fight the wars of nations if it brought somebody peace
Yes I'd fight the wars of madmen if I knew the fight would cease
But this ol' world never stopped turning when my mind was full of doubt
So I went on and played for a dollar a day and I sang  this song straight out 

Hey hey, every step of the way 
Though your dreams can be real, don't let them slip slide away 
Doesn't matter at all, let them do as they will 
Someday you'll hear them call for you
Oh yeah , for you
When they call out your name say it loud and clear 
Come on, come on 

You must have seen me traveling' around you must have seen me there
Tryin' to find out where I was heading you could have tossed to care 
Well, I had all the questions, I wanted the answers 
I knew in my heart it was all part of the game 
But every step was so much harder,  every step of the way 
I knew that time would beat me someday 

Hey hey, every step of the way 
Though your dreams can be real, don't let them slip slide away 
Doesn't matter at all, let them do as they will 
Someday you'll hear them call for you
Oh yeah, for you",Every Step of the Way

En la cara dos soles que sin palabras hablan
Que sin palabras hablan

La Flaca duerme de dia, dice que asi el hambre engaña
Cuando cae la noche baja a bailar a la Tasca
Y bailar y bailar, y tomar y tomar
Una cerveza tras otra pero ella nunca engorda
Pero ella nunca engorda

Por un beso de la Flaca daria lo que fuera
Por un beso de ella, aunque solo uno fuera
Por un beso de la Flaca daria lo que fuera
Por un beso de ella, aunque solo uno fuera
Aunque solo uno fuera

Mojé mis sabanas blancas, como dice la canción
Recordando las caricias que me brindó el primer día
Y enloquezco de ganas de dormir a su ladito
Porque Dios que esta flaca a mi me tiene loquito
O-oh, a mi me tiene loquito

Por un beso de la Flaca daria lo que fuera
Por un beso de ella, aunque solo uno fuera
Por un beso de la Flaca daria lo que fuera
Por un beso de ella, aunque solo uno fuera
Aunque solo uno fuera

Por un beso de la Flaca daria lo que fuera
Por un beso de ella, aunque solo uno fuera
Por un beso de la Flaca daria lo que fuera
Por un beso de ella, aunque solo uno fuera

Fechas de batallas
Pero que poco nos enseñan de amor
¡Discriminar!, eso no esta nada bien
Ante los ojos de Dios somos iguales
Sos el que hace las guerras
Y las falsas condenas
El que ama la violencia
Que no tiene conciencia

Nunca piensa, nunca piensa
No cuida ni su alma

Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny

But the devil take the women for they never can be easy

Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

I went up to my chamber, all for to take a slumber
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure t'was no wonder
But Jenny blew me charges and she filled them up with water
Then sent for Captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter

Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da

Stop trying to catch my eye

Got my mind made up

I like to watch the way the wind blows
What does it know that I don't yet
Ooh, oh, look so pretty now
You're just so sweet
Let's see how far you can get
See just how far you can get

She's so fine

And I like sometimes to wave it high
Up where everyone can see

I'm a lady
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up

I know that I've been mad but you really don't
Try to hold a light to me

I'm a lady
Got my mind made up

My two guns in my pocket cause it's brick today

The joker cops they ticket take my cash
The boys on the block

Got my street vision on I don't see shit
And still I stay fresh I spend the top dollar

I know what you here for now
Words out you're an idea whore though,
Now don't you crush on me
I'll see you in your pipe dreams
Whether or not you know it's true
You're who they dictate to
That shit must hurt real bad
Fakin' what you wish you had

Here all the folks come ask about me
Band wagon, know they used to doubt me
Blind side tend to hit real hard
You should heed the warning, get a body guard
Steady friction in this bitch
Creepin' in just like an itch
So far I got the last laugh
Still the rich rise up, still I live fast
Wouldn't know it face to face
Got no soul and got no taste
Moving in speed up the pace
I got it locked though, what a waste
All the talk is standard fare
Walk the walk if it gets you there
On the grind 'til the gig is up
I'm 'a smash 'em down

Trying to loose the world inside

For a cause I can defend

Oh take me home

Just be here 'til I know
'Til I know that the riot's gone, the riot's gone away

On the brink of something close
People know that I write
Know I'm grappling with a ghost

Oh I'm only dangerous, and I'm deafened by the fright
Waiting for the day I'm able

Ask me why a dream gets you by
But let it want, turns a dangerous thing
Watch out for it, it snakes right past
Then turns around and it sucks you in
What happens when you get stuck
Get to the bottom of the illusion that you're in
From the roots now it's shook up
Know that what ails without will do you in

Abates my fear

Abates my fear

We are gone
We are gone

Santonio,"I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone",San Antonio Rose
Sara Alina,"Is it just me or is it this world
Some days I’m happy
Some days I’m not
Do I have to be a better girl to make you realize what you got
When your ready come and tell me baby
When your ready let me know baby

Turning around there you are again
Saying I’m an unfaithful friend
But that’s not me
I’ve never been
Anything but your true friend
I don’t know where to go with this
I don’t know how to deal with it
I don’t know where to go with this
I don’t know how to deal with it ,so

Lead me to those better days
I don’t care what it takes
I wanna see those better days
When feelings where no issue, when all I had was the truth
Lead me to those better days
Lead me to those better days
I don’t care what it takes
I wanna see those better days

Ah, some days are better than others, why complain it does nothing for us, nothing
Everything I do is for us
Never them, were better than them , hurricanes weather them
One thing I can’t stand is pessimist, stay optimistic
Live your life, make the best of it
If you run the day or run sure
We came into the world alone, who can we run to, nobody
If you fall on your face you’re still moving forward
Get up, dust yourself off, keep going forward
Never complain, never explain
Our problems aren’t stop signs, they’re guidelines
Well done better than well said
You gotta conquer fear
Can’t walk around scared
Winners never quit
Quitters never win, everyday is a new beginning
May it never end
Umbrella case the rain comes
It say rainbows after the rain storms

Tomorrow there’s gonna be some rain
Need somebody to hold my hand
I gotta face this on my own
Gotta walk through this storm
And come out on the other side
With my head high and with a smile
I just wanna be alone again, I just wanna be alone again
Just wanna be alone again

Lead me to those better days
I don’t care what it takes
I wanna see those better days
When feelings where no issue, when all I had was the truth
Lead me to those better days
Lead me to those better days
I don’t care what it takes
I wanna see those better days
I wanna see those better days
I wanna see those, see those better days
Lead me to those better days",Better Days
Sara Bareilles,"Keep drinking coffee, stare me down across the table
While I look outside
So many things I'd say if only I were able
But I just keep quiet and count the cars that pass by

You've got opinions, man
We're all entitled to 'em, but I never asked
So let me thank you for your time,
And try not to waste anymore of mine
And get out of here fast

I hate to break it to you babe, but I'm not drowning
There's no one here to save

Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?

You sound so innocent, all full of good intent
Swear you know best
But you expect me to jump up on board with you
And ride off into your delusional sunset

I'm not the one who's lost with no direction
But you'll never see
You're so busy making masks with my name on them in all caps
You got the talking down, just not the listening

And who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?

All my life I've tried to make everybody happy
While I just hurt and hide
Waiting for someone to tell me it's my turn to decide

Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?

Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?

Sara Bareilles,"There's a harvest each Saturday night
At the bars filled with perfume and hitching a ride
A place you can stand for one night and get gone

It's clear this conversation ain't doing a thing
Cause these boys only listen to me when I sing
And I don't feel like singing tonight
All the same songs

In these deep city lights
Girl could get lost tonight
I'm finding every reason to be gone
Nothing here to hold on to
Could I hold you?

The situation's always the same
You got your wolves in their clothes whispering Hollywood's name
Stealing gold from the silver they see
But it's not me

In these deep city lights
Girl could get lost tonight
I'm finding every reason to be gone
Nothing here to hold on to
Could I hold you?

Calling out somebody save me I feel like I'm fading away
Calling out somebody save me I feel like I'm fadingâ?¦

I'm finding every reason to be gone

But don't worry daddy, I'm not addicted yet.
One too many drinks tonight and I miss you,
Like you were mine

Your stormy words have barely broken
And you sound like thunder though you've barely spoken
Oh, it looks like rain tonight and thank God,
Cause a clear sky just wouldn't feel right.

[Chorus]
He's taken and leaving but I keep believing
He's gonna come round soon
Till I see him again I'm staying believing
That it won't be deceiving when he's gonna come round soon.

You may be my final match.
'Cause I chase everything when you play throw and I play catch
It never took much to keep me satisfied
But all this bullshit you feed me you miss me you need me
This hungry heart will not subside

[Chorus]

Well I may seem naive if I cry as you leave like I'm just one more tortured heart
But baby don't be fooled.
Cause these cracks that I show as I'm watching you go aren't tearing me apart
And I know I'll see you soon

The angels said I'd smile today. Aw well who needs angels anyway?

Sara Bareilles,"Something always brings me back to you
It never takes too long
No matter what I say or do
I'll still feel you here 'till the moment I'm gone

You hold me without touch
You keep me without chains
I never wanted anything so much than to drown in your love 
And not feel your reign

Set me free, leave me be
I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity
Here I am, and I stand
So tall, just the way I'm supposed to be
But you're on to me and all over me

Oh, you loved me 'cause I'm fragile
When I thought that I was strong
But you touch me for a little while 
And all my fragile strength is gone

That you're everything I think I need here on the ground
But you're neither friend nor foe though I can't seem to let you go
The one thing that I still know is that you're keeping me down
You're keeping me down, eh ooh

Sara Bareilles,"I've been winding down the same road for days,
I've seen the coastline going both ways.
Some days are perfect, and some simply could not get worse.
Some days it's all worth it, and some days this life is nothing but a curse.
 
And I wonder who will break first
 
I am small. 
I feel like no more than nothing at all.
But when I lose sight of daylight, and my darkness falls
I'll be strong. 
And if not now it won't be long
From when I lose sight of daylight
And my hands are weak and my soul is tired
Oh, I'll give my love from the inside out
From the inside out
 
Little spirit, now don't you desert me now
I know I don't always hear it, but you don't always speak so loud.
And I'm not willing to simply lay down my soul for this.
It may be all that I'm giving, oh but take my love for what it is.
 
I am small. 
I feel like no more than nothing at all.

You've changed, you should. 
Cause I think I did too.
 
Made my mistakes, and did a few things right
But it will take what it will take, baby that's life
You cannot change what you do not own, everybody knows
But if you live deep and love strong you get pretty damn close
 
It moves fast and it scares me. 
I close my eyes, oh but I still see
 
I'm fading in and out what are you supposed to do save me know
From all of this danger you don't know how and I'll find my way out
When I'm in the red listening to strangers inside my head
The darkening angels beneath the bed I still see everything you said,
Painted in Red
 
I shake and I smile, cause you said
Baby girl it may take a while, but take the good from the bad
And never minds are never sure so never leave them wanting more

Taunting fires, touching wires, been believing liars, everything they said

You wouldn't see it coming
I keep you guessing

Hold me responsible. 
It's all my fault.
I want you to hold me any way you can.
Hold me accountable. 
It's all my fault.
I want you to hold me any way you can.

Can't scare you with my crime

I found what I want is what I cannot have
I didn't mean to be so predictable,
But I blame it all on who made you irresistible
 
And it isn't something I need 'til you tell me I can't
Why wear my heart on my sleeve when it looks so good in your hand.
 
My heart breaks in a heart beat
And you storm me when you come and go
The taste of something so sweet should have
Warned me 'bout the undertow.
Oh, I couldn't find a better man to let me go.
 
Little girl, I don't know why you stay.
If I had a feather for every time daddy said that I could fly away.
Old habits are so hard to break
It'd be a shame to stop now that I've started to make really good mistakes.
 
And I don't know why I must ask for the forbidden fruit.
I saw the snake in the grass, but I had bitten too soon.

Should recognize the signs a wave's gonna break

To burden your mouth for what you say
No pieces of paper in the way
Cause I can't continue pretending to choose
The opposite sides on which we fall
The loving you laters if at all
No right minds could wrong be this many times

My memory is cruel
I'm queen of attention to details
Defending intentions if he fails
Until now, he told me her name
It sounded familiar in a way
I could have sworn I'd heard him say it ten thousand times
If only I had been listening

Leave unsaid unspoken
Eyes wide shut unopened
You and me
Always between the lines
Between the lines

I thought I thought I was ready to bleed
That we'd move from the shadows on the wall
And stand in the center of it all
Too late two choices to stay or to leave
Mine was so easy to uncover
He'd already left with the other
So I've learned to listen through silence

Leave unsaid unspoken
Eyes wide shut unopened
You and me be
You and me always be

I tell myself all the words he surely meant to say
I'll talk until the conversation doesn't stay on
Wait for me I'm almost ready
When he meant let go

Leave unsaid unspoken
Eyes wide shut unopened

Always be

That will eat this up babe

Get down to the heart of it,

I am aiming to be somebody this somebody trusts
With her delicate soul
I don't claim to know much except soon as you start
To make room for the parts

At keeping your part of the bargain aw please

Skin has gotten thicker but it burns the same
Still a baby in a cradle got to take my first fall

Want to make it better better so bad.
But save your resolutions for your never new year
There is only one solution I can see here.

Crush on the guy at the liquor store

I'd rather sleep my whole life away than have you keep me from dreaming

Though you know she's only waiting on the next best thing

Snow White is doing dishes again 'cause what else could you do
With seven itty bitty men?
Sends them to bed and she calls up a friend, says will you meet me at midnight.

The tall blonde lets out a cry of despair says
Would have cut it myself if I knew men could climb hair
I'll have to find another tower somewhere and keep away from the windows.

You're so worried 'bout the maiden,
Though you know she's only waiting on the next best thing

Once upon a time in a faraway kingdom, man made up a story
Said that I should believe him
Go and tell your white knight that he's handsome in hindsight
But I don't want the next best thing

Can't take no more of your fairytale love

Only know she's only waitin on the next best thing
I don't care

No fame no money I'm nobody
The way I'm running has sure got me down

I'm going to trust you, babe
I'm going to look in your eyes
And if you say we'll be alright
I'll follow you into the light

Ooh, who I was without you, I can do without
No one knows where it ends, how it may come tumbling down

I'm with you now

And if you say we'll be alright
I'm gonna to trust you, babe

All of your time, just to hate me

There is something in the shadows
More than sister silhouette
Something sinister and strange

And I don't wanna be alone

I'm not ready for the darkness
Swear upon a heartless soul

And I don't want to cry when you go
Stay a little longer, you know

Throwing punches out into the black
If you have to tell me lies, I don't care

Worry 'bout it, worry 'bout it
I just keep breaking down
Breaking down, breaking down

Do without, do without
A night of the bad dreams, sad things
Tell me what that means

No familiar scars

And I don't breathe
No, I never meant to let it get away from me
No, too much to hold
Everybody has to get their hands on gold
And I want uncharted

I can't help but feeling

I'm going down

Like you'll show me where to go
I'm already out
A foolproof idea, so don't ask me how

'Til I get alone, 'cause I can't stay
In the middle of it all, it's nobody's fault, but I'm
So alone, never knew how much I didn't know
Oh, everything is uncharted

I know I'm getting nowhere

Love to watch the colors fade
They may not make sense
But they sure as hell made me

Waiting for the road to be laid
Though I may be going down
I'm taking flame over burning out

Somebody’s hands who felt like mine
Turned the key and took a drive
Was free

I recall the sun sank low
Buckley on the radio
Cigarette was burning slow
So breathe

Just yellow lines and tire marks
Sun-kissed skin and handle bars
And where I stood was where I was
To be

No enemies to call my own
No porch light on to pull me home
And where I was is beautiful
Because I was free

Once upon another time
Before I knew which life was mine
Before I left the child behind
Be

I saw myself in summer nights
And stars lit up like candle lights
I made my wish but mostly I
Believed

And yellow lines and tire marks
Sun-kissed skin and handle bars
And where I stood was where I was
To be

Once upon another time
Deciding nothing good in dying
So I would just keep on driving
Because I was free",Once Upon Another Time

Got this sugary me stuffed up in my sleeve
And I talk of ponies and rainbows and things
And I'm just who you want me to be
But like most creatures down here on the ground
I'm composed of the elements moving around
And I grow and change and I shift and I switch
And it turns out I'm actually kind of a b****
But that only happens when I get provoked
By some piece of s*** a**hole we all sadly know
And I sit and I write while reminding you all
That mean songs are still better than going postal

And that guy's an a**hole
That girl's a b****
Baby it's natural
No gettin' away from it
So sing it out with me
And then let it go

I see I've surprised you with some of my words
And I know that surprises, while fun, still can hurt
And I hate to think that I ruined the day
Of the dick and the queen of the high horse parade
But I'm sick and tired of your poisonous ways
Your toxin wasting perfectly good space
And I say what I think
'Cause it's more economic than drugs or a drink

Long ago and so many years before we
Ever were, ever dreamed we even could be

All alone in the corner of the night sky
Spiral bones of a supernova starlight
Fell in love with another burning bright she
Dreamed of a way to ignite she said,

Tonight
Come on, come on collide
Break me to pieces, I
I think you're just like heaven why

Come on, come on collide
Let's see what a fire feels like
I bet it's just like heaven

Just like heaven
Just like heaven

Such a shame
nowhere near, even the near mist light years away
From the hope of being sun-kissed anchored home
in her interstellar sea but, poor lonely Cassiopeia
So she sighs and she burns with desperation
Learns to cry over love of constellations
Then the spark from a star shooting too close
They both smiled what a day to explode, she said

Tonight
Come on, come on collide
Break me to pieces, I
I think you're just like heaven why

Come on, come on collide

Stuck between the dead and the living

Sitting on a graveyard shelf

In the center of Queens

The names and the dates, some
Older than others the skyscrapers, little tombstone brothers
With Manhattan behind her, three million stunning reminders
Built a cemetery
In the center of Queens

You said, remember that life is
Not meant to be wasted
We can always be chasing the sun!
So fill up your lungs and just run
But always be chasing the sun!

So how do you do it,
With just words and just music,
Capture the feeling that my earth is somebody’s ceiling
Can I deliver in sound
The weight of the ground
Of a cemetery
In the center of Queens

There’s a history through her
Sent to us as a gift from the future
To show us the proof
More than that, it’s to dare us to move
And to open our eyes and to learn from the sky
From a cemetery
In the center of Queens

You said, remember that life is
Not meant to be wasted
We can always be chasing the sun!
So fill up your lungs and just run
But always be chasing the sun!

And live like we’re still alive

Played by a cemetery

Not meant to be wasted

Illustrate the remnants of the life I used to live here in Eden
Rolled a lucky pair of dice,
Ended up paradise 
Landed on a snake’s eyes, took a bite and ended up bleeding

You know if I could change anything, I think I would start with the name
The truth is all those angels started acting the same 
And I know there’s no going back now 'cause
Life in Eden
Life in Eden changed 
No way to make the pain play fair 
It doesn’t disappear just because you say it isn’t there
So when they ask why’d she go you can say 'cause

Walking in the garden was a serpent-shaped heart and he told me 
What is broken cannot show, and less than beautiful is worse than unholy
Idolized my innocence,
Stole it from me in the end 
Now I’m wide awakened and still paying for the poison they sold me

You know if I could change anything, I think I would start with the name

I want to disappear and just start over
So here we are

And I’ll breathe again

'Cause I have sent for a warrior 
From on my knees, make me a Hercules
I was meant to be a warrior please
Make me a Hercules

I’ve lost a grip on where I started from 
I wish I’d thought ahead and left a few crumbs
I’m on the hunt for who I’ve not yet become
But I’d settle for little equilibrium 
There is a war inside my heart gone silent
Both sides dissatisfied and somewhat violent
The issue I have now begun to see 
I am the only lonely casualty

The very first words of a lifelong love letter

Tell the world that we finally got it all right
I choose
you
I will become yours and you will become mine
I choose
you
I choose
You, yeah

There was a time when I would have believed them
If they told me that you could not come true
Just love's illusion
But then you found me
And everything changed
And I believe in something again

My whole heart
Will be yours forever
This is a beautiful start
To a lifelong love letter

Tell the world that we finally got it all right
I choose
You
I will become yours and you will become mine
I choose
You

We are not perfect we'll learn from our mistakes
And as long as it takes I will prove my love to you
I am not scared of the elements I am underprepared,
But I am willing
And even better

It's for you, little lady
Is it all that you dreamed of?
How, if I knew, would've been there waiting
I'd have screamed out and jumped up

Now here I am
With my feet on the sand
And a body that won't move
The tide's coming in
And I'm bound for a swim
In a pair of cement shoes

He takes what he can, what he wants
Doesn't matter if it's ever been given
I took the bait and a chance on a man
Sold by the boy that he lived in

And I was wrong to believe that strength makes you strong
And I had hope in a change I would see in us both
And now I'm heavy
And he lifts me, but never once carried
Door number two I've already walked through

Ask me the question
Who coulda guessed I'd be here at this crossroad?
Plain to be seen that it's all up to me
I'm no longer alone, though

Nothing's changed
And I see it more every day
Nothing moves
It's a game to be played and to lose

And now I'm heavy, unsteady
But maybe I'm getting ready
And this might catch fire and char this ground
I might lift this up
To only be the one who's gonna get let down
Will I be enough to get this on its way to find some higher ground?

So innocent
I was lost for you to find
And now I'm yours and you are mine

Two tiny hands, a pair of eyes
An unsung melody is mine for safekeeping
And I will guard it with my life
I'd hang the moon for it to shine on her sleeping
Starting here and starting now
I can feel the heart of how

Everything changes
My heart's at the wheel now
And all my mistakes
They make sense when I turn them around
Everything changes
What I thought was so permanent fades
And I swear I'll remember to say we were both born today
Oh, and it's true
What did I do to deserve you

I didn't know, but now I see
Sometimes what is, is meant to be
You saved me
My blurry lines, my messy life
Come into focus in a tied, maybe
I can heal and I can breathe

I don't claim to be proud, but
my head wont be hung in shame

It's not what I wanted, but now that it's right here

I understand it
A story written by my own hand, it's
life biting right at your heels

But it's finally something to feel oh

Look around you
Ain't no saints here baby
We're all just looking for a little less crazy
And sometimes it's a hard left turn
Down a road you'd never thought you'd see
Don't you think dealing blame is a hazard

I grew up an only child in a suburb of the city
Spent my days alone my only friend was a stray kitty called Sardine
I thought it was hilarious to call a cat a kind of fish
She played hard to get hissing while she scratched me
What she was trying to say was ""Ogie come and catch me""
I learned quickly, perserverance stood between a cat and her new best friend, me

And all the carbon copy of where I've already been
Days keep coming one on one, and they keep coming

Don't know what I wish I had
But there's no time now
For thinking things like that
I've got too much to do (too much to do)
We've got too much to do, too much to do

Opening up, letting the day in
Pour you a cup and say, ""Hello, how ya been?""
Looking around, seeing the same things
It's comforting how some things never change
Never change, never change, do they?

I wouldn't call this place a happy end
But I've been 'round the block and just came back again
Could be worse, so make it work, no place is perfect

Hey, no good in the outside world
Because I feel too much and find it usually hurts
I like the way most of the days look exactly the same

Opening up, everyday starts
Over a cup, served with, ""Hello, how ya been?""
Welcoming in, whatever the day brings
More of the same things

Check the clock, tick, tick, tock
Don't stop, serve with a smile, hurry up
Fill the coffee cup, and then in a while
Take a breath, when you need to be reminded
That days like these, we can only do the best we can
And do it all again

It's the heartbeat, the center, the lifeline, you enter

Pour you a cup and say, ""Hello, how ya been?""

Sara Bareilles,"It's not simple to say
That most days I don't recognize me
That these shoes and this apron
That place and its patrons
Have taken more than I gave them
It's not easy to know
I'm not anything like I used be, although it's true
I was never attention's sweet center
I still remember that girl

She's imperfect, but she tries
She is good, but she lies
She is hard on herself
She is broken and won't ask for help
She is messy, but she's kind
She is lonely most of the time
She is all of this mixed up and baked in a beautiful pie
She is gone, but she used to be mine

It's not what I asked for
Sometimes life just slips in through a back door
And carves out a person and makes you believe it's all true
And now I've got you
And you're not what I asked for
If I'm honest, I know I would give it all back
For a chance to start over and rewrite an ending or two
For the girl that I knew

Who'll be reckless, just enough
Who'll get hurt, but who learns how to toughen up
When she's bruised and gets used by a man who can't love
And then she'll get stuck
And be scared of the life that's inside her
Growing stronger each day 'til it finally reminds her
To fight just a little, to bring back the fire in her eyes
That's been gone, but used to be mine
Used to be mine

Sugar, butter, flour
Sometimes I still see her
My mother the dreamer
She'd say, ""Nothing's impossible child""

A dream needs believing
To taste like the real thing
Like some stranger you recognize
So pure, so pure, so electric
So sure, so sure, so connected
To those little believers inside
May we all be so lucky

But dreams are elusive
The kind we've gotten used to
Is nothing I can feel
Nothing I can hold, nothing I can have, nothing that I know
Dreams come and they go

But hold them and keep them (but hold them and keep them)
And know that you need them (and know that you need them)
When your breaking point's all that
You have a dream is a soft place to land

So lucky

My hands pluck the things I know that I'll need
I'll take the sugar and butter from the pantry
I add the flour to begin what I am hoping to start
And then it's down with the recipe and bake from the heart

What's inside, everyone wants to know what's inside
And I've always told them, but I feel something needs to change

Sara Bareilles,"I stick with real things
Usually facts and figures
When information's in its place
I minimize the guessing game
Guess what?
I don't like guessing games
Or when I feel things
Before I know the feelings
How am I supposed to operate
If I'm just tossed around by fate?
Like on an unexpected date?

The stranger who might talk too fast
Or ask me questions about myself
Before I've decided that
He can ask me questions about myself
He might sit too close
Or call the waiter by his first name
Or eat Oreos
But eat the cookie before the cream?
But what scares me the most
what scares me the most

Is what if when he sees me, what if he doesn't like it?
What if he runs the other way and I can't hide from it?
What happens then?
If when he knows me, he's only disappointed?
What if I give myself away, to only get it given back?
I couldn't live with that

So, I'm just fine, inside my shell-shaped mind
This way I get the best view
So, when he sees me, I want him to

I'm not defensive
I'm simply being cautious
I can't risk reckless dating
Due to my miscalculating
While a certain suitor stands in line
I've seen in movies
Most made for television
You cannot be too careful
When it comes to sharing your life
I could end up a miserable wife

He could be criminal, some sort of psychopath
who escaped from an institution,
somewhere where they don't have girls
He could have masterminded some way to find me
He could be colorblind
How untrustworthy is that
He could be less than kind
Or even worse he could be very nice, have lovely eyes
And make me laugh, come out of hiding
What do I do with that?
Oh, God

What if when he sees me
I like him and he knows it?
What if he opens up a door
And I can't close it?
What happens then?
If when he holds me
My heart is set in motion
I'm not prepared for that
I'm scared of breaking open
But still I can't help from hoping
To find someone to talk to
Who likes the way I am
Someone who when he sees me
Wants to again",When He Sees Me

They've seen things that you never quite say, but I hear
Come out of hiding, I'm right here beside you
And I'll stay there as long as you let me

Because you matter to me
Simple and plain and not much to ask from somebody
You matter to me
I promise you do, you, you matter too
I promise you do, you see?
You matter to me

It's addictive the minute you let yourself think
The things that I say just might matter to someone
All of this time I've been keeping my mind on the running away
And for the first time I think I'd consider the stay

Because you matter to me
Simple and plain and not much to ask from somebody

And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail.

Where the bright lights are found
There ain't no way to slow you down
I'm about as helpless as a leaf in a gale
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail.

I turned on the radio

That the women folk had to fight
'Cause the good lord owned the daytime
But the devil seemed to own the night

Well, it came up out of nowhere
From a dark and bitter seed
It was the roughest kind of roadhouse
And a most unwanted weed
It drew the men folk like a magnet
The women knew what they had to do
So they put it in the hands of Jesus
'Cause they knew that he'd come through

And the rains came and the river swelled
And the more they prayed the more it fell
When the levies broke everybody saw
The awesome power of God
Then the clouds rolled back and the rainbow came
To bring a brighter day
'Cause when the flood hit Howard County
All the sins were washed away

Now the mothers tell the story
Of the week that the river raged
It's the passing of the wisdom
To the ears of tender age

Better keep a watchful eye

Hey, good is good but could be better

Sara Evans,"I remember the windows rolled down
And the wind in my hair
Drivin' around in your Daddy's old Chevy
Like we were goin' somewhere
We thought that summer would last us forever
And goin' steady was just something you do
I didn't know much about love
I learned that from you

Those were some good times
But lately they don't seem to last
I guess I'm not nearly as strong
As the drink in your glass
And the nights just get later and I could stay up and wait or
Just go on to bed like I do
I never knew nothin' about lonely
I learned that from you

I learned how to kiss on a ferris wheel
And I made wishes at wishing wells
And I fell into that fairy tale too
Now I know love ain't so easy
But we tried, didn't we baby, but it's alright
?Cause some dreams weren't meant to come true
I learned that from you

One night while the whole world was turnin'
I left you a note
And I told you that I'd always miss you
And then I let you go
Now I'm livin' outside of some town I ain't heard of
And I think about the boy that I knew
I didn't know we could fall out of love
I learned that from you

I learned how to kiss on a ferris wheel
And I made wishes at wishing wells
And I fell into that fairy tale too

Sara Evans,"She wore a dress with cherries on it
Going somewhere where she'd be wanted
A town this small, all they do is talk
No wedding ring chipped fingernail polish
She always wished that she could go to college
But some dreams fade, they just slip away
She started to show a few months ago
And she had to go, that's how she wound up

On the backseat of a greyhound bus
Head hung down with the windows up
Staring at the rest of her life
She never thought this would be the place
Where she would find her saving grace
But she fell in love, she fell in love
On the backseat of a greyhound bus

Oh, yeah, yeah

Moon was full the stars were smilin'
God has a funny sense of timin'
The baby came on the interstate
Somewhere between Jackson and Memphis
She finally found what she'd been missing
She cried and laughed when the red lights flashed
Sweet baby girl, she looked into the face of a new, the face of a brand new world


On the backseat of a Greyhound bus,
Heart so full that it could bust.
Starin' at the rest of her life.
She never thought this would be the place,
Where she would find her savin' grace,
But she fell in love; she fell in love,
On the backseat of a Greyhound Bus.

Give me a sad song that I can hold on to
Anything to set me free
Just one big cry, big tears in my eyes

Got some things I need to work out
I got this fever that just won't break
I got some troubles I got to shake

She stuck a note on the screen door
Sorry but I got to go
And that was all she wrote
Her Mama's heart was broke
And that was all she wrote
And so the story goes

Starin' out the window
Scratchin' and a rackin' his brains

Growed up to be a woman

And the clothes hangin' out on the line

Now don't you wonder what the preacher's
Gonna preach about Sunday morn'
Nothing quite like this
Has happened here before
Well he must of been looker
A smooth talkin' son of a gun
For such a grounded girl
To just up and run
Of course you can't fence time
And you can't stop love

After she spent all your money
Did she leave you just like you left me

Ain't gonna have nothing but
The supper on
Gonna keep him busy 'til it's time
He goes back to that coalmine

Some girls like them gussied up
Wearing all that smelly stuff
To me there's nothing quite so fine
As my man standing out in front of that

All mine, head to toe
Come on, come on whistle, blow
Power's out, well that's all right
We'll make love by a miner's light
Gonna keep him busy 'til it's time
He goes back to that coalmine

Countin' those ties on the railroad track
Just two more, it's almost time
To see my baby walking out of that

Coalmine, covered with dust
T-shirt tied, all muscled up
All mine, head to toe
Come on, come on whistle, blow
Don't want no white-collared man
Midnight, I like calloused hands
To keep me busy 'til it's time
He goes back to that coalmine

I can't wait to get him home
Ain't gonna have nothing but
The supper on
Power's out, well that's all right

Where they show me back in Missouri

It's motels, truck stops, all-night diners
Hoping that your song'll sell
And having to smile when it ain't doin' well
So when everything just gets too much
And I feel like I'm givin' up
I close my eyes and say a little prayer

He was just a boy of seventeen
And I was older by a year
And we spent everything we ever made

To get away from here
We got married in the winter time
At the Open Doors Cafe
No matter how he tried, he couldn't fine the peace of mind to stay

[Chorus]
All the glitter out in Hollywood
All the stars that never shine
They can't hold a candle to your wind
Could you roll me, roll me back in time

Got a job and worked the early shift
I spent hours by the phone
Promises are easy to forget
When there's too much time alone

You've got something they can't argue with
That's what all the people say
He's just wating for the obvious
His star is on his way, any day

[Chorus]

Just this side of sunrise,
You can feel it in the air
That something's bound to happen
It's just right there
Everybody loves you, it's so easy to see
But it's only, yeah, it's only in your dreams

I love the way you touch me
You know my body so well
You do much more than love me
'Til I'm overwhelmed
Wrapped up inside of you
Is where I wanna be
'Cause nobody knows, nobody knows
The secrets that we keep

Once we get inside these four walls
All the hesitation falls
We can't wait no more
And as you help me get undressed

You don't have to guess
Baby, you know what I want
I wanna love you 'til the sun comes up
'Til I'm sure you're satisfied

Is not the most glamorous life I know
But I've got so much more than most

I'm not famous but my kids think I'm a star
I'm not rich but I've made a million memories so far
I may not be a model
But my man thinks I could be
I may not be from royalty
But in these four walls
I'm the queen

I had it all planned
First I'd make it big in Nashville
Then take Hollywood by storm
But it was in God's hands

There were three little lives that would need me
To one day be their mom
I wouldn't trade it for anything
Those movies stars don't have everything
And I know I'm right where I wanna be

I had to let it go, but I have no regrets
I would have never known this kind of happiness

Sara Evans,"There I was
Ten years old
Waitin' in my room for him
To come home
And I just knew
He'd be so mad
Though I begged my mother not to, she told my dad
There was no denying I let him down
But instead of being angry
He put his arms around me and said...

In the sunlight or the rain
Brightest nights or darkest days
I'll always feel the same way
Whatever road you may be on
Know you're never too far gone
My love is there wherever you may be
Just remember that you'll always be my baby

There I was
Twenty-one
Oh, I was so ashamed
Of what I'd done
On a country road
Parked one night
Oh, it started out so innocent
Crossed the line
There was no denying
I let God down
But instead of being angry
He let his love surround me and I heard...

In the sunlight or the rain
Brightest nights or darkest days
I'll always feel the same way
Whatever road you may be on
Know you're never too far gone
My love is there wherever you may be
Just remember that you'll always be my baby

There he is
My little man
I'm sure he'll get in trouble every now and then
And I pray to God that when he does
I'll be just as understanding as my father was
'Cause the last thing that I wanna do is let him down
So instead of being angry, I'm gonna throw my arms around him

And I'll say in the sunlight or the rain
Brightest nights or darkest days
I'll always feel the same way
Whatever road you may be on
Know you're never too far gone
My love is there wherever you may be
Just remember that you'll always be my baby

And my jeans are ripped and I just can't stop
Drinking this wine
And I read this Bible and I search for signs
And little whisper that says you're alright
But sometimes

I'd like to get through a day without crying
Night without asking why I can't stop thinking about you
Get through a song without thinking
I'm drowning, I'm sinking
Wondering how I'm ever gonna get through
But my feet just keep moving
And I know the truth is
Nobody get through life without losing

You said you love me but you went away
Now I convinced myself it will be okay
But I don't know
Sometimes I think that I'm doing better
Then the night shows up and it drags on forever
And the Devil tells me we'll never be together

Get through a song without thinking

Sara Evans,"On a morning flight out of Birmingham he started talking
She'd never even met him, but Lord, she thought that
He'd never shut up
If she didn't look up
And pay attention
So she took off her headphones
Closed her book
And started listening

He said I just broke up with my girlfriend yesterday
In a 'Dear John' note she said I'm moving to L.A.
I'm calling it off
I'm taking the dog
And don't try to follow
She thinks she's a big star now
She made the Hollywood round
Of American Idol
Thirty minutes later she felt sorry for him a little
She moved from her seat on the aisle to the middle

Let him on
Let him by
Give him room
But don't ask why
'Cause love don't need no ticket to ride

She said I just can't believe someone would leave a man like you
You seem like a good one, in these days there are so few
Lord knows I've tried
To find a decent guy
But it's hard to do
The way I hate to shop
And how I love football
You'd think I'd have two
A second glass of wine just over the Rockies
They didn't see the signs but it was plain as plain can be

Buckle up, here comes love
Looks like cupid just showed up
Let him on
Let him by
Give him room

I want my arm(s) about you
That (those) charm(s) about you
Will carry me through...

He (she) says we'll have to wait.
Why wait till it may be too late?

Sara Gazarek,"In every heart there is a room 
A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds from lovers past
Until a new one comes along

I spoke to you in cautious tones
You answered me with no pretense 
And still I feel I said too much 
My silence is my self defense

And every time I've held a rose
It seems I only felt the thorns
And so it goes, and so it goes
And so will you soon I suppose

But if my silence made you leave
Then that would be my worst mistake
So I will share this room with you
And you can have this heart to break

And this is why my eyes are closed
It's just as well for all I've seen
And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows

So I would choose to be with you
That's if the choice were mine to make
But you can make decisions too
And you can have this heart to break

And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows",And So It Goes
Sara Gazarek,"The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldn't sleep
You know it sure is hard to leave here, Carey
It's really not my home

My fingernails are filthy
I’ve got beach tar on my feet
And I miss my clean white linen
And that fancy French cologne

Oh Carey, get out your cane
And I'll put on some silver
Oh, you're a mean old daddy
But I like you

Down to the Mermaid Café
And I will buy you a bottle of wine
And we'll laugh and toast to nothing
And smash our empty glasses down

Let's have a round for these freaks and these soldiers
A round for these friends of mine
Let's have a round for the bright red devil
Who keeps me in this tourist town

Oh Carey, get out your cane
And I'll put on some silver
Oh, you're a mean old daddy
But I like you

Maybe I'll go to Amsterdam
Maybe I'll go to Rome
And rent me a grand piano
And put some flowers 'round my room

But let's not talk about fare-thee-well’s now
The night is a starry dome
And they're playin’ that scratchy rock ‘n’ roll
Beneath the Matalla moon

Come on Carey, get out your cane
And I'll put on some silver
Oh, you're a mean old daddy
But I like you just fine

The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldn't sleep
You know it sure is hard to leave here, Carey
It's really not my home

Maybe it's been too long a time
Since I was scramblin' down in the streets
They got me used to that clean white linen
And that fancy French cologne

Come on Carey, get out your cane
And I'll put on some silver
Down to the Mermaid Café
Have fun tonight

I said, oh you're a mean old daddy
But you're out of sight
Carey, get out your cane

Sara Gazarek,"I wanna go all over the world
And start living free
I know that there’s somebody who
Is waiting for me

I’ll build a boat steady and true
As soon as it’s done
I’m gonna sail along in a dream
Of my dear someone

One little star, smiling tonight
Knows where you are
Stay little star steady and bright
To guide me afar

Rush, little wind, over the deep
For now I’ve begun
Hurry and take me into the arms
Of my dear someone
Hurry and take me into the arms
Of my dear someone

",Dear Someone
Sara Gazarek,"I keep waiting for a song to come and sing you back to me
I never felt so free as when I had you
Your rhythm was the best that's touched the likes of me
I was really me when I had you

Give me back that old familiar feeling
That left me feeling like I was someone
Give me back the song we sang in harmony
Just you and me singing together

My radio, it still plays the songs you like to hear
As if you were here, oh, I love you
I'll take the time to tune the station in real clear
Like when you were here, oh, I need you

Give me back that old familiar feeling
That left me feeling like I was someone
Give me back the song we sang in harmony
Just you and me singing together

Give me back that old familiar feeling
That left me feeling like I was someone
Give me back the song we sang in harmony

",Give Me Back That Old Familiar Feeling
Sara Gazarek,"I heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
You don't really care for music, do you?

It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
Now you never show it to me, do you?

I remember when I moved in you
The holy dove, she was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you

And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

That's four weeks old 
And I don't know how to say this 
I think we figured out 
This world is bigger than you and I 
We've exhausted our wealth, knowledge, 
Have no more answers for mankind 
And we've had every conversation in the world 
About what is right and what has all gone bad 
But have I mentioned to you that this is all I am 
This is all that I have 
And I'm not trying to judge you 
No that's not my job 
I am just a seeker, too 
In search of good 
Somewhere, somehow the subject became taboo 
I have no other way to communicate to you 
That this is all that I have, this is all that I am 
And we've had every conversation in the world 
About what is right and what has all gone bad 
But have I mentioned to you that this is all I am 
This is all that I have 
And I would like to share with you 
What makes me complete 
I don't claim to have found the truth 
But I know it has found me 
The only thing that isn't meaningless to me 
Is Jesus Christ and the way he set me free 
And this is all that I have, this is all that I am

It's always just a prayer away

I am the branch, and you are the vine.

Or I can make a mark on eternity.

Really, what do I know?

Like they're buying a new tailored suit
Does it fit across the shoulders
Does it fade when it gets older

In the Salvation Army pile
And search for something more to meet our needs

I think it's time I rediscover
All the ground that I have covered, like
Seek Ye first what a verse
We are pressed but not crushed,
Perplexed but don't despair.
We are persecuted but not abandoned
We are no longer slaves
We are daughters and sons,
And when we are weak
We are very strong

And neither death nor life
Nor present nor future
Nor depth nor height
Can keep us from the love of Christ

Is the Word that was
Who put on flesh to dwell with us.

But you are able 
And in your hands the pain and hurt

Sara Groves,"I'm trying to work things out
I'm trying to comprehend
Am I the chance result
Of some great accident
I hear a rhythm call me
The echo of a grand design
I spend each night in the backyard
Staring up at the stars in the sky

I have another meeting today
With my new counselor
My mom will cry and say
I don't know what to do with her
She's so unresponsive
I just cannot break through
She spends all night in the backyard
Staring up at the stars and the moon

They have a chart and a graph
Of my despondency
They want to chart a path
For self-recovery
And want to know what I'm thinking
What motivates my mood
To spend all night in the backyard
Staring up at the stars and the moon

Maybe this was made for me
For lying on my back 
In the middle of a field
Maybe that's a selfish thought
Or maybe there's a loving God

Maybe I was made this way
To think and to reason 
And to question and to pray
And I have never prayed a lot
But maybe there's a loving God

Maybe this was made for me
For lying on my back 
In the middle of a field
Maybe that's a selfish thought
Or maybe there's a loving God

Maybe I was mad this way
To think and to reason 
And to question and to pray
And I have never prayed a lot
But maybe there's a loving God

And that may be a foolish thought
Or maybe there is a God
And I have never prayed a lot
But maybe there's a loving God",Maybe There's a Loving God
Sara Groves,"Remember surrender 
Remember the rest 
Remember that weight 
Lifting off of your chest 
And realizing that it's not 
Up to you and it never was 

Remember surrender 
Remember relief 
Remember how tears rolled down 
Both of your cheeks 
As the warmth of a heavenly father 

Came closing in 
I want to do that again 
Why can't I live there 
And make my home 

In sweet surrender 
I want to do so much more than remember 
Remember surrender 
Remember peace 
Remember how soundly you fell fast asleep 
In the face of your troubles 

Your future still shone 
Like the morning sun 
Remember surrender 
Remember that sound 
Of all of those voices dying down 

But one who speaks clearly 
Of helping and healing you deep within 
I want to do that again 
Why can't I live there 

And make my home 
In sweet surrender 
I want to do so much more than remember

Oh surrender",Remember Surrender
Sara Groves,"So many words to say, but I'm opting for silence
So many days to live
I thinking I'm sitting this one out
Cause something I've been chasing finally stop to let me catch it
Something I've been longing for and dreaming about
It's a whisper in my ear
It's a shiver up my spine
It's the gratitude I feel for all that's right
It's a mystery appeal that's been granted me tonight
This peace
It's something so elusive
Something close but far away
It's the home that I can't live in yet somewhere in outer space
And sometimes I barely miss it when I walk into the room
The curtains are still swaying and I feel the air move
And it whispers in my ear and it shivers up my spine
It's the gratitude I feel for all that's right
It's a mystery appeal that's been granted me tonight
This peace
No time to grab a camera
No time to write it down
Just time enough to breathe it in
And linger
It's a whisper in my ear
It's a shiver up my spine
It's the gratitude I feel for all that's right
It's a mystery appeal that's been granted me tonight
This peace

Sara Groves,"You live your life like a tornado. 
Destruction follows everywhere you go. 
And you have no plans to stop or slow (oh). 
I will not let this bitter root grow in me. 
I will not let you leave that legacy, 
But it gets so hard when pain is all I see (oh). 
And every time I find healing, you're making a new mess, 
And I am learning the real meaning of forgiveness. 
And I tried to remove myself from your path, 
But I keep on waking up in the aftermath. 
So I pick up again and say I won't look back (oh). 
And I will not let this bitter root grow in me. 
I will not let you leave that legacy, 
But this constant fight is breaking me (oh). 
And every time I find healing, you're making a new mess, 
And I am learning the real meaning of forgiveness. 
And it hurts when you hit at the hearts of the ones I love; 
When everything you touch is rubble and dust. 
And it gets so hard to know how to trust, 
But I will not let that bitter root grow. 
I will not let it, no no. 
But it gets so hard (oh). 
And every time I find healing you're making a new mess, 
And I am learning the real meaning of forgiveness.

Who makes animals from driftwood

All I need is your monthly bonus for a wooden walrus

With the slightest invitation
You came with total detonation

Sara Groves,"I saw what I saw and I can't forget it
I heard what I heard and I can't go back
I know what I know and I can't deny it

Something on the road, cut me to the soul

Your pain has changed me
your dreams inspire
your face a memory
your hope a fire
your courage asks me what I'm afraid of
(what I am made of)
and what I know of love

we've done what we've done and we can't erase it
we are what we are and it's more than enough
we have what we have but it's no substitution

I have what I have and I'm giving it up
I do what I do with deep conviction

About God and the world and the human soul
How so much can go wrong

And the future's for his child
And he won't slow down

And the faith there's a prayer
In the prayer there's a promise

In the dream he is standing
And he stands without falling

That falling set in motion
All my strength and energy
Are raindrops in the ocean

So conditioned for the win
To share in victor's stories
But in the place of ambition's din
I've heard of other glories

I pray for an idea
And a way I cannot see
It's too heavy to carry
And impossible to leave

I can't just fight when I think I'll win
That's the end of all belief
And nothing has provoked it more
Than a possible defeat

I pray for an idea

We lay it on the altar

Do you call on all your alibis

Did you feel the pull, did you hear a call
Did you take a chance and lose it all
Do you fear there's no collateral left for trying

Friend I know your heart is raw
But love is still a worthy cause
Picking up and pressing on
Oh love is still a worthy cause
It's the touch that starts the thaw
Love is still a worthy cause
Or the word that breaks the pause
Love

In the midst of passing bravery
In the face of our own injury
It's the constant generosity of grace

It's the beauty in the tales we tell
It's the pushing through and ending well
And finding strength to give ourselves away

When I had nothing
I love because he loved me

Taken in the night
Told it will be working in the city for a while

Staring from the windows 
Leaning in the door
Flickering like a candle lying on the floor

Say a prayer, say a prayer in the night
Say a prayer, say a prayer in the night

Bearing all the glory, bearing all the weight
Knowledge of such hardship
At such a tender age

It's more than I can handle
But your word is burning like a fire shut up in my bones

With so many battles left unfought

I think of Paul and Silas in the prison yard
I hear their song of freedom rising to the stars
And when the Saints go marching in
I want to be one of them

Lord it's all that I can't carry and cannot leave behind
It often overwhelms me
But when I think of all who've gone before and lived the faithful life
Their courage compels me
And when I'm weary and overwrought
With so many battles left unfought

I think of Paul and Silas in the prison yard
I hear their song of freedom rising to the stars

I see the shepherd Moses in the Pharaohs court
I hear his call for freedom for the people of the Lord

And when the Saints go marching in
I want to be one of them
And when the Saints go marching in
I want to be one of them

I see the slave awakening to the value of her soul

I see the young missionary and the angry spear
I see his family returning with no trace of fear

I see the long hard shadows of Calcutta nights
I see the sisters standing by the dying man's side

I see the young girl huddled on the brothel floor
I see the man with a passion come and kicking down the door

I see the man of sorrows and his long troubled road
I see the world on his shoulders and my easy load

And when the Saints go marching in

Oh life's too short to live  a lie
And truth is you're my reason why

I can be myself tonight
You make me feel so alive
I can be myself tonight
I'm letting out what lies inside

Sara Haze,"300 channels and the new movies
A king size bed just for me
Five course meal when I pick up the phone
Massage and facial from hands I don't know
Got the whole world at my feet
But still I'm not complete
Cuz it takes a part of you
To make all of me

Your kiss has long left my lips
But I still got the taste
I just wanna be with you
But you're miles away
Counting down the days

Cross off another day gone by
Calendar pages scratching time
Wave goodbye to a silent night
Alone again and I don't know why

Don't where you are right now

You're like a needle underneath my skin

Guess the fear of leaving made me stay

Praying that you'll change
Of walking the line 
Between pleasure and pain

Some things are just worth the waiting
And sometimes you got to be the one who bends

Taking me to the universe edge
Returning carefree through the night

Of taking me on an adventure through the mist
To some romantic galaxy
When all along
You could not commit

You fly away
Stealin' my heart
Like takin' dust from the stars
Like takin' dust from the stars 

Using all of me till there was nothing left
An emptiness I don't regret
So fly always if you must

Hot water scalding

In some selfish act
Of gratification

I can never give again
I always said I'm not like that

I know I can't undo it
Somehow I just gotta get through it
If I turn up the heat till I start to scream
Will I find my soul cleansing 
In the scalding steam

And cleanse myself of all this pain
I need to cry I could die

My heart nearly bled to death
And now I'm dying for a little salvation

You don't really want a real girl

No hurt no stain

Not a cloud in my personal sky

Could

In a perfect sky
The morning sun 
Will be yours and mine
A sea of peace
Will wash over me

With only common sense to tell me why I

Dog barking to the heat of the beating sun
Hot ground, sweet ground a feeling of fever in the air
Kissing the nape of your neck, sighing colors
Breaking sticks into heartsick flaming words

In the fields making love
The luck of the Irish tucked between your toes
Love's debt pays regret, in months I begin to show
Dressing as a car drives by gasping buzzards
Turning time into a lover's rhyme
Pressed between the pages of my heart

In the fields where are you?
Are you hiding yourself there still?
Oh in the fields where are you?
Are you hiding yourself in a city of weeds?
Are you hiding yourself in a city of glass?
In a city of glass

In the fields tripping on
Pushing through the barbs to reach the greener side
It was years ago we let each other go
To follow the paths of our dreams

Sometimes I carry the memory, full time
Delivering the spitting image of you
Eyes burn and I live at peace
I did what I had to do and you, and you, and you

Tossing flowers, the names engraved with pencil marks

Like all at once I wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you (I think I love you)

This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room
I think I love you (I think I love you)

I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I got so much to think about

Hey, I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say I never felt this way

Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy and if you say ""hey go away"" I will

Sara Hickman,"A-Tisket A-Tasket
A green and yellow basket
I bought a basket for my mommie
On the way I dropped it
I dropped it, I dropped it
Yes on the way I dropped it
A little girlie picked it up
And took it to the market
She was truckin' on down the 
Avenue without a single thing to do
She was peck, peck, peckin' all around
When she spied it on the ground
A-Tisket A-Tasket
She took my yellow basket 
And if she doesn't bring it back
I think that I shall die
(Was it red?)
No, no, no, no
(Was it brown?)
No, no, no, no
(Was it blue)
No, no, no, no

Sara Hickman,"I thought I'd have to pay to feel good
By all the pretty things that caught my eye
Empty as my pocketbook I stood
With only common sense to tell me why I

Can't put my finger on it
I can't hold it in my hands
But I'll wrap my arms around it
Then let it go
To come around again

Elusive as a lizard in the grass
Compelling as an ancient mystery
Sudden as a twister and as fast
As a train from leon to paree I

Can't put my finger on it
I can't hold it in my hands
But I'll wrap my arms around it
Then let it go
To come around again

Mothers hold their babies to their breast sisters see their brothers off to war
Lovers put each other to the test oceans spend their waves upon the shore

I told you there was something in the air
Beyond our limitations to perceive
A feeling that there's more than nothing there
Challenging us simply to believe in love

Can't put your finger on it
You can't hold it in your hands
But you'll wrap your arms around it
Then let it go to come around again

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Sharing a park bench quietly?
How terribly strange to be seventy

Sarah Bettens,"Sometimes it takes some falling down 
To get back on your feet
I often think the things I want
The things I really need
I noticed yesterday that lately I
haven't noticed much
Colours change and people change
And I am busy handling the remote

When you see this I don't let me drag you down
When you feel this way don't let me drag you down
I need you to turn me upside down

In every room, in every house
Someone's always waiting to be heard
Sitting on my big behind 
I am hardly rescuing the world

When you see this I don't let me drag you down
When you feel this way don't let me drag you down
I need you to turn me upside down

Don't let me hide
Behind the question why

When you see this I don't let me drag you down
When you feel this way don't let me drag you down
I need you to turn me upside down
",Don't Let Me Drag You Down
Sarah Bettens,"Don't stop trying
there's always reason to go on living
as long as long as you can breathe
stay clear of extremes
just say what you mean
but try not to be mean

you should say thank you often, like your hair
wave to strangers everywhere
do what your supposed to do
don't look at what the others do

think before you buy a car,
don't marry someone you met at a bar
there's no such thing as going too far
love who you are

don't be scared of what's ahead
but wear a helmet to protect your head
be aware, say you care , don't say fair...

Stay close to the hand that raised you
watch for signs
never waste expensive wine
spoil your body, spoil youself
never cheat and share your wealth

sing when you're glad
close the door if you sound bad
don't believe a man who knows he's right
don't skip ahead, enjoy your flight

be nice to your dog,
drive slow in the fog
convince yourself to write a song
change clothes everyday
call ahead when you're late
be safe when you're planning to get laid

read what you like
be on your brother's side
it's okay to wonder why
but don't expect to understand your life

don't expect to understand your life ...",Don't Stop
Sarah Bettens,"I look up and I look down
I take my shoes off to be closer to the ground
I can think of many ways
To screw up all these perfect days
But I am feeling bold an brave 
I think I'll just feel good today

Somehow in the twisted world I'm really doing fine
You can say this peace of mind was never really mine
But I feel fine

Here's one reason to be sad
Half of us have nothing and the other feels too fat
But this nog the the time and place
To crucify the human race
There's a massive height to ride 
I'm keeping my eyes open wide

Somehow

I don't want to close my eyes
Someone tell me how long I 
Can keep this day inside

Somehow

I don't always wake up this alive 
But I have you so I feel fine",Fine
Sarah Bettens,"Someday I'll stop trying and I'll know
How much time I've wasted always wanting more
I doubt you'll end up where you need to be with me
I tend to run in circles, walkin in my own sea
I can run and play and dive into the ocean
I can touch the sand and feel it slip away

You could follow me, I don't know where
I'm going, you could follow me
You could follow me, it might not be the 
Smartest thing to do but you could follow me

I want you to be happier than me
I'm a poor example of a carefree human being
Here's a list of thing I wish to be
Your pillow and your blanket and your
Life time guarantee
I can love you all the way across the ocean
And I doubt that that will ever go away

You could follow me 

If I stop believing there's a reason for my life,
I might as well stop trying to make
Sense of what is right, 
You could follow me

But you Should follow me",Follow Me
Sarah Bettens,"This is when the wall comes down
This is when I give myself to every inch of me that says
It's time to go
The voice is clear, but not alone
Doubt had made my head it's home
And I can hardly hear myself explode
Someone tell me something good, 
Something I can really use

Here I go, say goodbye to everything
I know, Here I go, I love you till the end of time
I have to do this on my one so heter, here I go

On the edge of everything
The start, the end, the in between
But somewhere trough my fear I know I'm fine

Nothing like the way it's been, 
An open door I've never seen
And I can't help but wonder what's inside
Someone tell me something good
Something I can really use

Here I go 

Sure I guess I must be strong
But what if I am just very wrong
What if I don't know
Where I belong

Here I go",Go
Sarah Bettens,"For every time you tell me that I can't be who I am
For every time you twist my arm and get me to confess
For every door you close on me
For every boy or girl you turn your back to
You will pay the price of someday knowing 
that you think you tried and jet you failed
To see that you can't change me

I told myself today
It's pretty nice to find your way
No matter what you say
I am not insane

For every so called victory you lose a piece of you
The one that shows you love can be in everything you do
Love can be in everything you do

I told myself today
It's pretty nice to find your way
No matter what you say
I am not insane

Look inside you find what drives you
I can't change you

I told myself today
It's pretty nice to find your way
No matter what you say

Sarah Bettens,"When something dies
Or comes to life
When water shines in yellow light
When something moves 
Inside a tree
I wish you saw things just like me

When I walk around
Lost and found
And I feel my feet as they touch the ground
And I'm happy just to be right there
I wish that I could somehow share 
The thing my stomach does when I think of us

What if we had one second to be?
Just like the other what would we see?
What if you knew exactly what you are to me?
Would you be terribly surprised?
To see who I am in my actual size
A second is short, but more then enough
You would feel loved, you would feel loved
	
What you hear, when music sings
What makes you sad, what sadness brings
Do you feel empty when you cry?
If I could only find out why you fear the things you fear
And make it disappear

Sarah Bettens,"I used to know I was always right
Too old to be cute, too small to mind
I sometimes say things really loud
I found out that volume can make up for content drought

Scream until you lose your breath
Force your way  inside some youthful soul tonight
Teach him only you are right

I used to know how to change the word
I lie awake at night and envy that girl
Sometimes i think it's not hard to tell
the good and bad apart
and that idea confirms my fear I'm not the brightest person here

From the every day that's always just the same
She says, she wants to find a better way
She needs to throw the perfect picture away
She runs and runs behind the sun

When it all comes down someone's gonna have to save you
When it all falls down back to where your mother raised you 
What a way to die

she doesn't need anyone to tell her who she is

Sister I need you more now than I ever did
I've been thinking again, I've been thinking again

We've had our share of surprises, 
There must be a good one coming our way

Understood the damage done
Daddy, it was not my fault

And tell me he's alright

And soon believe he's gonna change
He'll never be the same

I know you told me not to touch
But I wanted to, so very much

Well, where lonely ghosts have flown

When there's no absolutes anymore

And faith deserts an open heart

Though I feel it sinking further everytime
And th weight of my mistakes
Means that everything I touch breaks
I don't want to see you as the next in line

So that's why I won't wake you where you lie
If I could now I'd freeze time
I can't find forever in your eyes
I should leave you while they're dry",Perfect Now
Sarah Blasko,"There is a wailing girl at your feet
Tears overflowing, burnt like the rest
Don't waste your time; she's a weapon tonight
With no direction, bound to start a fight

Her love is only wasted on remorse
True or two-timing faker
Her only choice

There's a relation, but they are not the same
She is fire, him embers - one cannot put the other one out
New, worn or discarded are we all not the same?
Funny how it happened now there's nowhere to put the blame

Their love is only wasted on remorse
True for two diamond fakers
They've only choice

Speeches to learn
Secrets to burn

Silence is overspent

Still warbles the blackbird his note from the tree;
Still trembles the moonbeam on streamlet and fountain,

Sarah Brightman,"A flaxen-headed cowboy, as simple as may be,
And next a merry plough boy, I whistled o'er the lea;
But now a saucy footman, I strut in worsted lace,
And soon I'll be a butler, and whey my jolly face.

When steward I'm promoted I'll snip the tradesmen's bill,
My master's coffers empty, my pockets for to fill.
When lolling in my charlot so great a man I'll be,
So great a man, so great a man, so great a man I'll be,
You'll forget the little plough boy who whistled o'er the lea.
You'll forget the little plough boy who whistled o'er the lea.

I'll buy votes at elections, and when I've made the pelf,
I'll stand poll for the parliament, and then vote in myself.
Whetever's good for me, sir, I never will oppose:
When all my ayes are sold off, why then I'll sell my noes.

I'll joke, harangue and paragraph, with speeches charm the ear,
And when I'm tired on my legs, then I'll sit down a peer.
In court or city honour so great a man I'll be,
So great a man, so great a man, so great a man I'll be,

[When I Lived With My Father]

When I lived with my father
As an apprentice shepherd,
He sent me to the moor
To look after the sheep.
Sheep, sheep,
I had but a few.
Sheep, sheep,
I had none that were bonny.

No, I had but a few,
I had but three lambs;
And the wolf from the plain
Ate the finest of those.
Sheep, sheep,...

He was so ravenous
He left only the pelt,
He left only the tail
To put on my hat.
Sheep, sheep,...

But the bones of the animal
Made me pipe
To play at the fair,
At the village fair.
Sheep, sheep,...

So the village could dance
Beneath the great elm,
Young women and old
With clogs on their feet.
Sheep, sheep,...","Quand j'étais chez mon père, for voice & piano (Folk Songs, Vol. II)"
Sarah Brightman,"As sweet Polly Oliver lay musing in bed,
A sudden strange fancy came into her head.
""Nor father nor mother shall make me false prove,
I'll 'list as a soldier, and follow my love.""

So early next morning she softly arose,
And dressed herself up in her dead brother's clothes.
She cut her hair close, and she stained her face brown,
And went for a soldier to fair London Town.

Then up spoke the sergeant one day at his drill,
""Now who's good for nursing? A captain, he's ill.""
""I'm ready,"" said Polly. To nurse him she's gone,
And finds it's her true love all wasted and wan.

The first week the docter kept shaking his head,
""No nursing, young fellow, can save him,"" he said.
But when Pooly Oliver had nursed him back to life
He cried, ""You have cherished him as if you were his wife"".

O then Polly Oliver, whe burst into tears
And told the good doctor her hopes and her fears,
And very shortly after, for better or for worse,
The captain took joyfully his pretty soldier nurse.","Sweet Polly Oliver, for voice & piano (Folk Songs, Vol. III)"
Sarah Brightman,"There's none to soothe my soul to rest,
There's none my load of grief to share
Or wake to joy this lonely breast,
Or light the gloom of dark despair.

The voice of joy no more can cheer,
The look of love no more can warm
Since mute for aye's that voice so dear,
And closed that eye alone could charm.","There's none to soothe, for voice & piano (Folk Songs, Vol. III)"
Sarah Brightman,"The trees they grow so high and the leaves they do grow green,
And many a cold winter's night my love and I have seen.
Of a cold winter's night, my love, you and I alone have been,
Whilst my bonny boy is young, he's a-gowing.
Growing, growing,
Whilst my bonny boy is young, he's a-gowing.

O father, dearest father, you've done to me great wrong,
You've tied me to a boy when you know he is too young.
O daughter, dearest daughter, if you wait a little while,
A lady you shall be while he's growing.
Growing, growing,
A lady you shall be while he's growing.

I'll send your love to college all for a year or two
And then in the meantime he will do for you; 
I'll buy him white ribbons, tie them round his bonney waist
To let the ladies know that he's married.
Married, married,
To let the ladies know that he's married.

I went up to the college and I looked over the wall,
Saw four and twenty gentlemen playing at bat and ball.
I called to my true love, but they would not let hime come,
All because he was a young boy and growing.
Growing, growing,
All because he was a young boy and growing.

At the age of sixteen, he was a married man
And at the age of seventeen he was a father to a son,
And at the age of eighteen the grass grew over him,
Cruel death soon put an end to his growing.
Growing, growing,
Cruel death soon put an end to his growing.

And now my love is dead and in his grave doth lie,
The green grass grows o'er him so very, very high.
I'll sit and I'll mourn his fate until the day I die,
And I'll watch o'er his child while he's growing.

Sarah Brightman,"The water is wide, I cannot get o'er,
And neither have I wings to fly.
Give me a boat that will carry two,
And both shall row, my love and I.

O, down in the meadows the other day,
A-gath'ring flowers both fine and gay,
A-gath'ring flowers both red and blue,
I little thought what love can do.

I leaned my back against some oak
Thinking that he was a trusty tree;
But first he bended, and then he broke,
And so did my false love to me.

A ship there is, and she sails the sea,
She's loaded deep as deep can be,
But not so deep as the love I'm in;
I know not if I sink or swim.

O, love is handsome and love is fine,
And love's a jewel while it is new,
But when it is old, it groweth cold,
And fades away like morning dew","O Waly, Waly, for voice & piano (Folk Songs, Vol. III)"
Sarah Brightman,"Away from you
There is no music,
There is no sunlight,
The world is gray.
Away from you
The clocks are frozen,
And time's a traveler
Who's lost his way.

The people I meet
Might as well be statues,
The words we exchange
Might as well be Greek.
The room that I'm in
May be bright and cheerful
But to me
It's dim and bleak.

I'm half alive
Until the moment
The door swings open
And you walk through.
Now my world starts to glow
Like a stained-glass window
And what was old and cold
Is warm and new.
And so you see
Why I can never be
Away from you.

Away from you
The world is lifeless
As though creation
Has gone awry.
The trees are bare,
There are no flowers,
The fields are thirsty,
The streams are dry.

We live, you and I,
For a breath of sunlight,
So brief an escape
From a world of gray.
Our moments of warmth
Have been touch and go, love,
But tonight, we'll touch
And stay.

The people I meet
Might as well be statues,
The words we exchange

I'm half alive
Until the moment

And you walk through.
Now my soul is afloat
On a wave of music
That I could feel such joy
I never knew.
And so you see
Why I can never be
Away from you.",Away From You
Sarah Brightman,"Dreamers have mountains they will climb
There are dreamers who don't believe in time
Only dreamers have worlds where they can fly far away.

Certain dreamers have kingdoms they will build,
Filled with treasures and dragons to be killed
Only dreamers have wings with which to fly far away.

Some people dream of being rich,
While others dream of being tall
And there are people who don't dream at all.

Dreamers have shooting stars they chase,
There are others with nightmares they must face.
Sometimes dreamers are forced to leave their dreams far away.

And there are people who don't dream at all.

Sometimes you need to take the time
To find treasures and mountains we can climb.
And maybe we dream to change the way that we feel,
'Cause to dreamers the real world can be unreal.",Dreamers

White as sheets

Sarah Brightman,"When I was a girl, I had a favourite story
Of the meadowlark who lived where the rivers wind
Her voice could match the angels' in its glory,
But she was blind,
The lark was blind.

An old king came and took her to his palace,
Where the walls were burnished bronze and golden braid,
And he fed her fruit and nuts from an ivory chalice and he prayed

""Sing for me, my meadowlark
Sing for me of the silver morning.
Set me free, my meadowlark
And I'll buy you a priceless jewel,
And cloth of brocade and crewel,
And I'll love you for life if you will
Sing for me.""

Than one day as the lark sang by the water
The god of the sun heard her in his flight
And her singing moved him so, he came and brought her
The gift of sight,
He gave her sight.
And she opened her eyes to the shimmer and the splendor
Of this beautiful young god, so proud and strong
And he called to the lark in a voice both rough and tender,
""Come along,

Fly with me, my meadowlark,
Fly with me on the silver morning.
Past the sea where the dolphins bark,
We will dance on the coral beaches,
Make a feast of the plums and peaches,
Just as far as your vision reaches,
Fly with me.""

But the meadowlark said no,
For the old king loved her so,
She couldn't bear to wound his pride.
So the sun god flew away and when the king came down that day,
He found his meadowlark had died.
Every time I heard that part I cried.

And now I stand here, starry-eyed and stormy.
Oh, just when I thought my heart was finally numb,
A beautiful young man appears before me
Singing ""Come
Oh, won't you come?""
And what can I do if finally for the first time
The one I'm burning for returns the glow?
If love has come at last it's picked the worst time
Still I know
I've got to go.

Fly away, meadowlark.
Fly away in the silver morning.
If I stay, I'll grow to curse the dark,
So it's off where the days won't bind me.
I know I leave wounds behind me,
But I won't let tomorrow find me
Back this way.

Before my past once again can blind me,
Fly away.

And we won't wait to say goodbye,

made of iron!

Man 2 - With seas as high as the name mast!
Man 1 - We had lifeboats everywhere, sir, but there were sixteen men
washed overboard.

Replace the cook

Across the straits
Around the horn
How far can sailors fly
A twisted path
Our tortured course
And no one left alive

Unknown to man
Where ships come home to die

Nor fortress hold
Could match our captain's eye

And seas so blue

A crash of drums, a flash of light,
My golden coat, flew out of sight.

Still hesitating.

Sarah Brightman,"I don't know how to love him.
What to do, how to move him.
I've been changed, yes really changed.
In these past few days, when I've seen myself,

I seem like someone else.
I don't know how to take this.
I don't see why he moves me.
He's a man. He's just a man.

And I've had so many men before,
In very many ways,
He's just one more.
Should I bring him down?

Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love,
Let my feelings out?
I never thought I'd come to this.

What's it all about?
Don't you think it's rather funny,
I should be in this position.
I'm the one who's always been

So calm, so cool, no lover's fool,
Running every show.
He scares me so.
I never thought I'd come to this.

What's it all about?
Yet, if he said he loved me,
I'd be lost. I'd be frightened.
I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope.

I'd turn my head. I'd back away.
I wouldn't want to know.
He scares me so.
I want him so.

I love him so.",I Don't Know How to Love Him
Sarah Brightman,"Midnight
Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her mem'ry?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Mem'ry
All alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
Life was beautiful then
I remember
The time I knew what happiness was
Let the mem'ry live again


Ev'ry street lamp
Seems to beat
A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters
And a street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning


Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new life will begin


Burnt out ends of smokey days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies
Another night is over
Another day is dawning


Touch me
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with my mem'ry
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is
Look a new day has begun ..",Memory [From Cats]

Sarah Brightman,"Gus is the cat at the theatre door
His name, as I ought to have told you before
Is really Asparagus, but that's a fuss to pronounce
That we usually call him just Gus
His coat's very shabby, he's thin as a rake
And he suffers from palsy that makes his paw shake
For he was in his youth quite the smartest of cats
But no longer a terror to mice or to rats

For he isn't the cat that he was in his prime
Though his name was quite famous, he says, in his time
And whenever he joins his friends at their club
(Which takes place at the back of the neighbouring pub)
He loves to regale them, if someone else pays
With anecdotes drawn from his palmiest days
For he once was a star of the highest degree
He has acted with Irving, he's acted with Tree
And he likes to relate his success on the halls
Where the gallery once gave him seven cat calls
But his grandest creation as he loves to tell
Was Firefrorefiddle, the fiend of the fell


Sir John 
I have played in my time every possible part
And I used to know seventy speeches by heart
I'd extemporize backchat, I knew how to gag
And I knew how to let the cat out of the bag
I knew how to act with my back and my tail
With an hour of rehearsal, I never could fail
I'd a voice that would soften the hardest of hearts
Whether I took the lead, or in character parts
I have sat by the bedside of poor little Nell
When the curfew was rung then I swung on the bell
In the pantomime season, I never fell flat
And I once understudied Dick Whittington's cat
But my grandest creation, as history will tell
was Firefrorefiddle, the fiend of the fell

Sarah 
Then, if someone will give him a toothful of gin
He will tell how he once played a part in East Lynne
At a Shakespeare performance he once walked on pat
When some actor suggested the need for a cat

Sir John 
And I say now these kittens, they do not get trained
As we did in the days when Victoria reigned
They never get drilled in a regular troupe
And they think they are smart just to jump through a hoop

Sarah 
And he says as he scratches himself with his claws

Sir John 
Well the theatre is certainly not what is was
These modern productions are all very well
But there's nothing to equal from what I hear tell
That moment of mystery when I made history
As Firefrorefiddle, the fiend of the fell

You would know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunked in
His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed
His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed
He sways his head from side to side with movements like a snake
And when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake

Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
For he's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
But when a crime's discovered then Macavity's not there!

He's outwardly respectable, I know he cheats at cards
And his footprints are not found in any files of Scotland Yard's
And when the larder's looted or the jewel case is rifled
Or when the milk is missing or another peke's been stifled
Or the greenhouse glass is broken and the trellis past repair
There's the wonder of the thing Macavity's not there!

Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity
He always has an alibi and one or two to spare
What ever time the deed took place Macavity's not there!

And they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known
I might mention Mungojerrie, I might mention Griddlebone
Are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time
Just controls the operations: the Napolean of crime!

Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
He's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
But when a crime's discovered then Macavity

Sarah Brightman,"Midnight, not a sound on the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet, and the wind begins to moan.

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember a time I knew what happiness was

Let the memory live again
Every streetlamp seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters in the streetlamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes tonight will be a memory too

And a new day will begin another day is dawning
Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Burnt out ends of smokey days

The stale cold smell of warning
The streetlamp dies
Another night is over
Of my days in the sun

If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is
Look a new day has begun",Memory
Sarah Brightman,"Night time sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses

Slowly, gently night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it secretly posses you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind 
In this darkness that you know you cannot find
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start to journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling, sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in 
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night",The Music of the Night

So brief an escape
From a world of gray.

Have been touch and go, love,
But tonight, we'll touch
And stay.

Is grey.

A wall of rain as it turns to sleet,
The lack of sun on a one-way street,
I love the grime all the time.
And what more do I need?

My window pane has a lovely view:
An inch of sky and a fly or two.
Why, I can see half a tree.
And what more do I need? 

The dusk is thick and it's galling;
It simply can't be excused.

Used.

Someone starting a brawl,
Down the block there's a riot,
And I'll buy it all!

Listen, now I'm ecstatic,
Hold me close and be still.
Hear the lovely pneumatic
Drill!

A subway train thunders through the Bronx,
A taxi horn on the corner honks.
But I adore ev'ry roar.
And what more do I need?

I hear a crane making street repairs,
A two-ton child running wild upstairs.
Steam pipes bang,sirens clang,
And what more do I need?

The neighbors yell in the summer,
The landlord yells in the fall,
So loud I can't hear the plumber
Pound the wall.

An aeroplane roars across the bay,
But I can hear you as clear as day:
You said you love me
Above the sound and speed.

With your love, 
What more do I need?",What more do I need [From Saturday Night Fever][#]

Drown out all the rain
Light a patch of darkness
Treacherous and scary

Whisper when you're sleeping

I'll be there to stop
The chills and all the weeping

Make it clear and strong
So the whole night long
Every signal that you send
Until the very end
I will not abandon you my precious friend

So try to stem the tide
Then you'll raise a banner
Send a flare up in the sky
Try to burn a torch
And try to build a bonfire

Every signal that you send
Until the very end
I'm there

So whistle down the wind

But I must be on my way...""

We used to love while others used to play.
Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by,

Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small,
And you don't ask the time of day.
But you and I, our love will never die,
But guess who'll cry come first of May.

The apple tree that grew for you and me,
I watched the apples falling one by one.
And as I recall the moment of them all,
The day I kissed your cheek and you were gone.

And you don't ask the time of day.
But you and I, our love will never die,

No more talk of darkness,
forget these wide-eyed fears;
I'm here, nothing can harm you,
my words will warm and calm you.
Let me be your freedom,
let daylight dry your tears;
I'm here, with you, beside you,
to guard you and to guide you.

Christine (Sarah)
Say you'll love me ev'ry waking moment;
turn my head with talk of summertime.
Say you need me with you now and always;
promise me that all you say is true,
that's all I ask of you.

Let me be your shelter,
let me be your light;
you're safe, no one will find you,
your fears are far behind you.

Sarah Brightman,"I don't expect my love affairs to last for long
Never fool myself that my dreams will come true
Being used to trouble I anticipate it
But all the same I hate it, wouldn't you?

[Chorus]
So what happens now?
Another suitcase in another hall
So what happens now?
Take your picture off another wall
Where am I going to?
You'll get by, you always have before
Where am I going to?

Time and time again I've said that I don't care
That I'm immune to gloom, that I'm hard through and through
But every time it matters all my words desert me
So anyone can hurt me, and they do

[Chorus]

Call in three months time and I'll be fine I know
Well maybe not that fine, but I'll survive anyhow
I won't recall the names and places of this sad occasion
But that's no consolation, here and now

Don't ask anymore",Another Suitcase in Another Hall [From Evita]
Sarah Brightman,"Love, love changes everything: hands and faces, earth and sky.
Love, love changes everything: how you live and how you die.
Love can make the summer fly, or a night seem like a lifetime.
Yes, love, love changes everything, now I tremble at your name.
Nothing in the world will ever be the same.

Love, love changes everything: days are longer, words mean more.
Love, love changes everything: pain is deeper than before.
Love will turn your world around, and that world will last forever.
Yes, love, love changes everything, brings you glory, brings you shame.
Nothing in the world will ever be the same.


Off into the world we go, planning futures, shaping years.
Love bursts in and suddenly all our wisdom disappears.
Love makes fools of everyone: all the rules we make are broken.
Yes, love, love changes everything: live or perish, in its flame.

Love will never ever let you be the same.",Aspects of Love [From Love Changes Everything] [From Aspects of Love]

At sixes and sevens with you

Though it seems to the world they were all I desired

Sing once again with me

My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The phantom of the opera is here

Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear

Voyage, voyage
Voyage, voyage
Wilderness to wilderness
I traveled from afar

Came fragrance of Araar
Splendor of a thousand suns shone glory in my path
No love more pure and rage more fierce
Could still my beating heart
Voyage, voyage
Voyage, voyage

[Part 3: Promise]
So
Should I return to trace the shadows of my chases
My steps will echo there from sand to stone
I will never let my eyelids close on empty spaces
My dreams will fill the void with tales unknown
Know the mighty infinite obscures the far horizon
The whispered road I take will never bend
Alone
And will the wind return my story to its promise
Or will my story chase me to my end

Think of me
think of me fondly,
when we've said
goodbye.
Remember me
once in a while -
please promise me
you'll try.


When you find
that, once
again, you long
to take your heart back
and be free -
if you
ever find
a moment,
spare a thought
for me ...


We never said
our love
was evergreen,
or as unchanging
as the sea -
but if
you can still
remember,
stop and think
of me ...


Think of all the things
we've shared and seen -
don't think about the things
which might have been ...


Think of me,
think of me waking,
silent and
resigned.


Imagine me,
trying too hard
to put you
from my mind.


Recall those days,
look back
on all those times,
think of the things
we'll never do -
there will
never be
a day, when
I won't think
of you ...


Raoul
Can it be?
Can it be Christine?


What a change!

not a bit
the gawkish girl
that once you were ...



She may
not remember
me, but
I remember
her ...

Sarah Brightman,"When I was a kid, I played on this street
I always loved illusion
I thought make-believe was truer than life

If this is real, how should I feel?
What should I look for?

If you were smart, you would keep on walking

My heart could see, way into the future
All of that goes when I see your face

I should hate you

Anything but only me
Quiet years in too much space

Sarah Brightman,"Once I hated this city,
Now it can't get me down.
Slushy, humid and gritty,
What a pretty town.

What, thought I, could be duller,
More depressing, less gay.
Now my favourite colour
Is grey.

A wall of rain as it turns to sleet,
The lack of sun on a one-way street,
I love the grime all the time.
And what more do I need?

My window pane has a lovely view:
An inch of sky and a fly or two.
Why, I can see half a tree.
And what more do I need? 

The dusk is thick and it's galling;
It simply can't be excused.
In winter even the falling snow looks
Used.

My window pane may not give much light,
But I see you, so the view is bright.
If I can love you, I'll pay the dirt no heed!
With your love, what more do I need?

Someone shouting for quiet,
Someone starting a brawl,
Down the block there's a riot,
And I'll buy it all!

Listen, now I'm ecstatic,
Hold me close and be still.
Hear the lovely pneumatic
Drill!

A subway train thunders through the Bronx,
A taxi horn on the corner honks.
But I adore ev'ry roar.
And what more do I need?

I hear a crane making street repairs,
A two-ton child running wild upstairs.
Steam pipes bang,sirens clang,
And what more do I need?

The neighbours yell in the summer,
The landlord yells in the fall,
So loud I can't hear the plumber
Pound the wall.

An aeroplane roars across the bay,
But I can hear you as clear as day:
You said you love me
Above the sound and speed.

With your love,

Regnava nel silenzio
Alta la notte e bruna ...
Colpìa la fonte un pallido

Raggio di tetra luna ...

L'ombra mostrarsi a me!
Qual di chi parla muoversi
Il labbro suo vedea,
E con la mano esanime

Chiamarmi a sè parea.

Poi rapida sgombrò,
E l'onda pria sì limpida,
di sangue rosseggiò! -

Sarah Brightman,"Leave and let me go
You're not meant for me, I know
Carry on, carry on
And I'll stay strong

Leave and let me go
I will think of you, I know
But carry on, carry on
And I'll stay strong

Someone else will keep you warm from now on
Someone else will keep you safe from the storm
But I'll be with you wherever you go
So you will never be alone
I'm going where the wind blows
Going where the lost ones go

[Chorus]
I will be with you
I'm losing the love I found
Crying without a sound
Where have you gone?
I will be with you
You were my fool for love
Sent me from high above
You were the one
I will be with you
I'm going where the wind blows
Going where the lost ones go

Leave and let me go
Don't look back, just let me know
Carry on, carry on
You must stay strong

Nothing ever looks the same in the light
Nothing ever seems to quite turn out right
When you realize that you have been loved
Than you will never be alone
I'm going where the wind blows
Going where the lost ones go

[Chorus]

Leave and let me go
Baby I can't come along
Carry on, carry on
You must stay strong",I Will Be with You (Where the Lost Ones Go)
Sarah Brightman,"It's tempting
Haunting
Love is the law
It's temple
It's empty
From grace we fall
It feels like
On the outside
Looking in
We always wonder
How it could have been

[Chorus]
Let it rain
Let it rain
Why we can't we find love again
Let it rain
Let it rain
Still I drown in tears of pain
Over again
Let it rain

Chances
Hunger
Insatiable
Life is changing
Unpredictable
Hear me calling
Where are you now?
Will we meet
Anyway
Anyhow

[Chorus x2]

[Bridge x2]
Where do we end?
Where do we begin?
Are we lost
Or must we lose to win?
We depend
On where we stand
Are we free
To choose the lives we live?

[Chorus x2]",Let It Rain
Sarah Brightman,"Sueñas con un amor
Puro, sin condición
Fuerte, eterno como el sol
Con el que se dibuja una pasión

Sueñas con un amor
Limpio, con devoción

Libre, sacar las alas del corazón
Y Volar a dónde anida la pasión

[Chorus]
La pasión, es como un viento inquieto
Que se convierte en libertad
Es saber que hay alguien más que vive
Deseando poderte encontrar
Es viajar sin miedo entre las
estrellas y la inmensidad

Es atravesar el fuego,
caminar sobre las aguas
Convertir un sueño en realidad
La pasión es ésa fuerza inmensa
Que mueve a toda la creación
Es saber que alguien te está esperando
Mas allá dónde se oculta el sol
Es borrar por siempre de
tí la palabra soledad
Son dos almas que se unen
llegando así a la eternidad

Nunca te faltará
Alguien en quien confiar

Un ángel que de la mano te llevará
A descubrir un mundo de pasión

[Chorus]

Vives con un amor
Fuerte y sin condición
Libre y ponerle alas al corazón
Volar adónde anida la pasión",Pasión
Sarah Brightman,"I don't know what I'm supposed to say
When now suddenly you feel so far away
And you're not prepared to talk
And if you're now afraid to listen
Then I don't want to do this anymore

Oh I don't know which way that I should turn
Seems the more we love
The more we have to learn
And I keep staring into space
Like it somehow has the answer
So don't let the music end
Oh my darling

[Chorus]
Symphony
It's gone quiet around us now
How I wish you would hold me
And that you never told me
That it's better if you leave
Look at the sun
We're starting to lose all of the light
Where we once burnt so brightly
Tell me we might be
Throwing it away

Well you don't know what you've got
Until it's gone
But then nothing ever hurt like holding on
I am scared and unprepared
And I feel like I am falling
So can you tell me
Where did we go wrong?

[Chorus]

If everything is broken
Then it's better that we give up
And remember how we once had
Something beautiful

It's the shore movement, she's happy being there
For an age before the stars that beat
Now there's no more dreamers
For I am happy,
oh shine on
In our flowered air
Our walls crumbled in

Fear of some, who we know
These are feelings, suffering
Tell me now this is, true love
My soul's on fire, floating slowly
Olden days, olden days
I felt sheltered in and thank you
Treasure spread
Tremors in safe heart
Be younger than my young self
where we were
Loving my guidance

These are feelings of suffering
Tell me now this is true love

It's looking like a beautiful day

Someone tell me how I feel
It's silly wrong, but vivid right
Oh, kiss me like the final meal
Yeah, kiss me like we die tonight
'Cause holy cow, I love your eyes
And only now I see the light
Yeah, lying with me half awake

If you think I wink, I did

Got down on his knee an' then he proposed.

Sarah Buxton,"It's the first time that I've been here
Since I was here with him.
I remember all the wildflowers,
Waving in the wind.
Life was an undiscovered river, and I was jumping in headfirst.

It was sink or swim, do or die,
Sneaking out on summer nights,
Stealing wine from my Pa,
The thrill of not getting caught.
Now and then I miss those days
But coming back to this place
I realize it ain't him I miss.
It's that young girl, wild-eyed, first love, one time innocence. Yeah.

We ran off to the cornfields just outside the county fair.
There were butterflies in my stomach
And fireflies in the air.
He tried hard not to show it,
Oh but he was just as scared as me.

It's that young girl, wild-eyed, first love, one time innocence.

And coming here has made me come to this:
The one thing I can't get back is the one thing I miss.
It was breaking rules, flying blind
What you see through younger eyes
It wasn't what I thought it was.
Man I swore he was the one.

The love story never starts in October

It is what it is, like nothing’s amiss

As if it isn't plain to see we should just let it be
And if it tastes this sweet, then call me out

He’s kinda cold but once he gets you it’s cool
Around here there isn’t much for us to do
But it’s never enough and we try so much
We’re always losing when our time could be up
And when he looks at me it feels like that night
I met him laughing under sodium lights
Called out my name, so do it again
We had no idea just how this would end

There's no going back and no going forward
And we’re pulled apart and stuck in a corner

Made this something important
And I feel it now, can you feel it too?

It don't matter if you´re black
White or yellow, if you're brown or red
Let´s get down to that

I remember when,
I was a child and couldn't understand

Discriminating all the different ones
Mama just used to say
When you grown up you'll maybe find a way
To make these people see
That everything I do 
Comes back to me

You gotta live your live
They gotta live their life
We're all the same no one's to blame
They gotta live their lives

It don't matter if you´re black
White or yellow, if you're brown or red
Let´s get down to that
Love is color-blind
You´re my brother 
You´re my friend
All that matters in the very end
Is to understand
Love is color-blind

I remember as a young boy
I watched my neighborhood go up in flames
I saw the whole thing through tears of pain
And a situation´s rackin' my brain

Maria, hear my prayer
Today I'm asking for forgiveness
For all my people here on earth
I know they feel inside their hearts

True love is all it needs to heal them
But hate is all they really know
So innocent the starving children
How I wish they'd get a chance to grow

Sarah Connor,"If it's magic
Then why can't it be everlasting
Like the sun that always shines
Like the poets endless rhyme
Like the galaxies in time

If it's pleasing
Then why can't it be never leaving
Like the day that never fails
Like on seashores there are shells
Like the time that always tells

It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst

So
If it's special
Then with it why aren't we as careful
As making sure we dress in style
Posing pictures with a smile
Keeping danger from a child

It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst

So
If it's magic
Why can't we make it everlasting
Like the lifetime of the sun
It will leave no heart undone
For there's enough for everyone

To fight the unbeatable foe 
To bear with unbearable sorrow 
And to run where

To right the unwritable wrong 
And to love pure and chaste from afar 
To try when your arms are too weary 
To reach the unreachable star 
This is my quest 

To follow that star 
No matter how hopeless 
No matter how far 
To fight for the right 
Without question or pause 
To be willing to march, 
March into hell 
For that heavenly cause 
And I know 

If I'll only be true 
To this glorious quest 
That my heart 
Will lie peaceful and calm 
When I'm laid to my rest 
And the world will be 
Better for this 
That one man, scorned 
And covered with scars, 
Still strove with his last 
Ounce of courage

Zum letzten mal gefühlt?
Mit ausgestreckten Armen
Die Wolken fast berührt?

Zeit
Mahl ihre Bilder quer durch mein Gesicht
Zeit is 'ne Katze
Nein treu ist sie
Nicht wenn du denkst sie bleibt stehen wird sie gehen
Dreht sich nicht mal nach uns um
Sie schleicht sich vorbei und reibt sich an dir
Lässt dich warten und treibt sich herum

Baby Baby Baby sag nichts
Und lieb mich jetzt als wär heut' der letzte Tag
Baby komm und schlag mich zur Königin
Und wenn nur für eine Nacht
Nichts ist für immer
Versprochen hab ich mich schon ich hab kein Schimmer
Versprochen hab ich mich schon Mal

Leicht ist die Liebe und süß ist ihr Gift
Zwingst du sie zu bleiben dann will sie dich nicht
Trifft sie dich dann entkommst du ihr nicht
Wirst zum Junkie der high bleiben muss
Liebe macht blind, weil wir sind wie wir sind
Bettelst du un den nächst besten Schuss

Ah, Baby Baby Baby sag nichts
Und lieb mich jetzt als wär heut' der letzte Tag
Baby komm und schlag mich zur Königin

Außer mir besteht keine Gefahr

Hope that you were there

Hold on, hold on for now

The sun was going down
Called the Lost and Found

How many secrets
Do you store?
Can you answer truthfully?
One small question for me?

The way I want him to?
Will he protect me
Or will he leave me sad and blue?

I need a clue
Am I his only girl?
Or has he quite a few?

Are my kisses as sweet
As he wants them to be?

Doe she see in me
A love secure and more?
Can I depend on
Forever being in his arms?

Cause it felt like hell was running after me

The one I used to write with everyday.
But it doesn’t feel right in my hands,
Some guitars they don’t understand the blues.

When I’m feeling sad,
When I’m looking back,
I take out that old blue guitar.

Its got a belt buckle scratch on its back.
Three-year old strings and worn out frets.
Though I have to tune it constantly,
It’s the only place I found a melody.
It’s close to the hollow sound of pure lonely.

When I’m feeling sad,
When I’m looking back,
I take out that old blue guitar.

I should be thinking about bikinis and a suntan
Drinking mojitos with my toes in the sand
Instead I’m staring out the window as the rain falls
Going crazy climbing up these walls
Missing You

Forget about the good times
Standing in your sunshine
Cause it don’t matter now
I wasted a few tears
Threw away a good year
But it don’t matter now

I should be thinking about tomorrow
Been waiting all winter for the summer to come
Instead I’m wishing that something might turn you around
And get me out of this heartbreak town.

Sarah Darling,"I guess I saw him coming but
It still took me by surprise
A different man, a different place
But the same look in his eyes

He looks go good
When he kisses so good
And it feels so good
But it's no good

I'm a once burned twice shy
Woman with a jaded eye, wants it all and nothing less
He's a big bright shiny lookin'
White knight waitin with an icecube in his chest
And his words won't mean a thing
When you're waitin for a king
Why settle for the jack of hearts

You can't be safe and sorry
I just had to take the leap
But in candle light it's hard to see
That the waters not that deep

When he kisses so good
And it feels so good

Picking up the pieces

So many night's I'd spend alone
I cried myself to sleep

I'll sing it where ever you are

Sarah Fimm,"Mr. Cripple man, do you still feel your hands?
The light you never fill, she's waiting by the door.
While atoms play around, you sit here to obstruct.
I never thought to think that what goes down does not come up.
We're hostage on the gravity train, just when we move forward we fall back again.
The sharpness of his nail, it hammers down the fold.
In all this time, we're just Running from the Whole.
Enter woman, girl.
Enter to your left, stage right.
The chaos it ensues, beneath the coating of your skin.
Her boa it constricts, the spotlight on a barren soul.
She needn't ask the stars just what it's like to feel star cold.
We're hostage on the gravity train. Just when we move forward we fall back again.
The sharpness of his nail, it hammers down the fold.
In all this time we're just Running from the Whole.
And when I leave again, I'll cycle through this atmosphere.
Past a marching band of souls, who scrape me with their human eyes.
A taste of bitter earth, I'll just bring with me a dollar's worth.
My face burns from the wind and it's time to shed my second skin.
We're hostage on this gravity train. Just when we move forward we fall back again.
The sharpness of his nail, it hammers down the fold.
In all this time we're just Running from the Whole.

Pounding doors? They are whores when yourself is all you've got.
But I still see the green, yes I still see that green,
And it makes me want to scream.
So a break in command starts causing flies, 
But a flowing backward motion brings it back.
This thing in my perception has left us here to bleed, 
And it makes me want to scream.
Rest assured little pigs, You can snort your way into heaven, 
I'll assign the rooms, you just count your sheep.
A little fairy pricked just tonight, 
She said, ""one wish is granted for the girl who hates the world.""
So I gave her all my money in a jar of broken dreams,
I gave her all my screams.
So rest assured you little pigs. All little piggies go to heaven. 
I'll mobilize the souls, you just count your sheep.
Is anyone here listening? Human or undead. 
Is anger just our nourishment? Our piece of daily bread?
Cause it's all a part of feeling of ripping out your weeds, 
And it makes me want toâ?¦.scream.",Scream
Sarah Fimm,"
The sun has set
The ground is cold and wet
And I still haven't left
And time she let us rest
For long enough
But we're growing up
Things are different
You used to listen

Isn't it strange
How can we go on like this?
Flies in the dark
Looking for a spark
But something's gotta give
'Cause if it won't change
How can we go on like this?
How can I live?

It's just a dream
It's just a silhouette
That hasn't happened yet
But the earth is moving fast
And if I'm gone before the dawn
Take all that there was
And make it live

Isn't it strange
How can we go on like this?
Flies in the dark
Looking for a spark
But something's gotta give
Cause if it won't change
How can we go on like this
How can I live?

Cause it's just another moment
I could've played the game
I could've done without this
But I didn't.
So why can't I acknowledge
The more things change
The more they stay the same.

Isn't it strange
How can we go on like this?
Flies in the dark
Looking for a spark
But something's gotta give
Cause if I won't change
How can it go on like this
How can I live?

I had you down as certainly mine
No doubt about it a love to last forever this time

Now you're gone everything right has turned wrong
My heart is aching how long does it take
For all these scars to heal

After love when all the dreams have flown
Baby, it's hard to be alone making it through each day
After love why do I see your face
How can I ever fill the space you left inside of me


Someone please help me
I've got to find a way to forget
I'm lost without you that's why I haven't stopped crying yet

Every night just when I think I'm alright
Memories of you I can't fight
Like a stream they rush into my head

I was hypnotized, patronized
By your smile
You seem to take my breath away

Deep inside I am crying
I have to let go

Baby baby blue
The road isn't clear
I don't want you near me no more
Baby baby blue
We've been here before
And I just can't take it no more


My lonely soul is hungry for love
I'm delusively, reluctantly
On my own
Although I need you so desperatley
I see the lies in your eyes
There's no where to hide

You're my true love companion
But love isn't here by my side
Don't you hear my heart calling
I'm torn up inside

Chorus

I've been waiting for a miracle
Looking for the touch of an angel to show
I've been feeling so vulnerable
Playing this game with the devil
Holding my hand

This feeling I try to deny
Deep inside I am crying
I have to let go

One thing would never change

I'll never let you see me blue

You were burning in my life
Dancing to an island song
Making love until the dawn

You said you'd write
But you disappeared from sight
Nothing in the world is feeling right, oh

Everyday I've been thinking about you
I can't stand being another day without you
Gotta memory that I'm hoping comes true
Is this love? That I'm feelin'

Every night a little hope is passing
Is there something here that could be lasting
Every beat of my heart is asking
Is this love ?

Looking in my picture book
Starting at the photo we took
Something in your face possessed me
Something in your smile just get me
Why can't you be
More than just a fantasy
Why can't I see
What is right in front of me
Nothing in the world is feeling right, oh

Everyday I've been thinking about you
I can't stand another day without you
Gotta memory that I hope comes true

I promise you'll never do wrong
I'll be glad to give you my all

You'll crave the love you threw awa 
The time will come when you'll be blue

You'll toss around and call my name 
You'll walk the floor the way I do

Sarah Harmer,"I can throw away my fears
Up into the atmosphere
They race away at the rate
Of the smoke and rust
Look at all the poor drivers
Gotta go to work while I sleep
Steel town's light keep on glowing
On smokestacks that keep blowing
In my eyes so I can't see it
In my mind so I believe it
Every time
I can see it in your eyes
I can read it on your thigh
They're not like either of us at all
Rivers of headlights keep shining
On wheels that we used for grinding
If I cry I can't see it
If I lie then I'd believe it
Every time
Look at all the poor bastards
Gotta go to work
Every time",Everytime
Sarah Harmer,"I almost dialed your number when I
Thought the coast was clear
'Cause it's looked up for so long
At me
And said call me please
Well the place was closing
And the countergirl turned to sign the cooks
Were gettin' their coats
And I got mine, and said good night
To the sea, of empty seats

Chorus 1:
And if I am a sailor
You are the warm golf wind
And you've blown into this little port
And roused my dreams again

I see my mouth moving when I talk to you
I do, I see my lips and I feel like a kid
Who can't keep something in
'Cause I've been under the paper you write along
You left your impression on after you'd gone on me
Marks only I can see

Chorus 2:
And if I am a sailor
You are the warm golf wind
And you've blown into this little port
And roused my dreams again
When we say sometime later
You know that we don't say when
You have blown into this little port
And roused my dreams again

I almost dialed your number when I
Thought the coast was clear
'Cause it's looked up for so long
At me
And said call me please

Sarah Harmer,"If they blow a hole in my backyard
Everyone is gonna run away
The creeks won't flow to the Great Lake below
Will the water in the wells still be ok?

We'll need to build some new apartments 
And I know we're gonna have to fix the roads
But if we blow a hole in the escarpment 
The wild ones won't have anywhere to go

If they blow a hole in the backbone
The one that runs cross the muscles of the land
We might get a load of stone for the road
But I don't know how much longer we can stand

We'll keep driving on the Blind Line
If we don't know where we want to go
Even knowledge that's sound can get watered down
Truth can get sucked out the car window

We're two-thirds water
What do we really need?
But sun, showers, soil and seed
We're two-thirds water
The aquifers provide
Deep down in the rock
There's a pearl inside

If they blow a hole in the backbone
The one that runs across the muscles of the land
We might get a load of stone for the road
But I don't know how much longer we can stand.
",Escarpment Blues
Sarah Harmer,"When the days close on
The memories that you've acquired
And your body
Cannot hold your soul inspired

You are here and not alone
Everybody has come home
There's a bed made up upstairs
If you get tired

All the heaviness around you will get light
And your worry lifted up into the night
Left with nothing but pure love
Left with all you are made of

Can I stay around awhile
Is that all right?
Oh, lives don't end
Goin' out to be brought back again
Our lives don't end
",Goin' out...
Sarah Harmer,"How deep in the valley must you go
To find what your footsteps already know
The way on is the way out
There are signs to follow
There is deep in the valley
And I'm bound to go

How deep in the valley must you stay
To know why your footsteps led you that way
The way on may be truly to stand in one place
And let the deep of the valley
Fill you will grace

And treat yourself lightly
Treat yourself kind
You've got nothing to worry on
You will be fine
You will leave this place laughing 
And somebody will cry
There is deep in the valley
Wonder not why

Wonder not why go
Wonder not to stay
If it takes me and I follow
Or if I lead the way
It can come when it wants to 
But it might have to wait
There is deep in the valley 
I don't hesitate

I don't take it too lightly
But it don't weigh down too low
There is high on the cliff top
And there are deep creeks below
There's a green shade you can't miss
Where the spring water flows
There is deep in the valley
And I'm bound to go

How deep in the valley must you go
To find what your footsteps already know
The way on is the way out
There are signs to follow
There is deep in the valley
And I'm bound to go

Sarah Harmer,"Well now how did they get that lady on TV
Laughing so naturally
For a Wal-Mart ad
Is it not as bad as I thought?

There's a woman sending poisonous mail
And they caught her now she's sitting in jail
While the weather station forecasts hail
From the tropics

Oh I spent the day in a shopping mall
Through the biggest storm of the century
I'm a mountain
I'm a mountain like you said to be

The sports man and his double chin
Don't listen to me in this state I'm in
Saying things about people that I don't know

Well it's just that way when you get hurt
And the things you need you're made to work 
You must decide if you will die or grow

Oh I spent the day in a shopping mall
Through the biggest storm of the century
I'm a mountain
I'm a mountain 
Like you said to be

Sarah Harmer,"Oleander, Oleander
Will you bloom again this spring?
I adored you
Then I ignored you
And now to me you're everything
And those white blossoms that you gave freely 
Are now just twinkles in your eye
Oh behold her 
Oleander grows on the inside

She will forgive me
For I bring water
A sunny window to sit by
Oleander, I understand her
She's just waiting for the time
To say it's all right
Another season has brought us another chance
We're together in this hot weather to dance

Oleander, I think you're better
I think you made it through another winter

Nothing has ended
It's all been mended
It's the way that it should be
You're coming back 
You're coming back 
It was so lonely here just me
This time no promises of what's to come
We'll just live it for the day
Oleander I see you stand there and I know you'll be ok

Oleander I think you're better
I think you made it through another winter

Sarah Harmer,"It was a late-in-the-summer night
Nearing the end of a bumpy ride 
Through the backstage parking lots of the country
We went past the cars at the fray
The cops on bikes
The security gate
Into the trees where the dark comes easy
See the light of the Venus shining
High over the mid-western plains
Is it telling you you gotta go?
That your heart's been burning way to slow
I guess I'm the last to know again

But I will rise up, I will
Who was the Phoenix anyway?
Just some bird that flew away
And flies still

It was a late-in-the-summer day
The breeze had blown the clouds away
The fluttering ones were covering the fields
I've been walking by myself
I've been thinking about you again
Maybe one day I'll tell you how I feel
See the light of the satellite tower
The only thing that's blocking our view
Is it telling you what's on my mind
That I think about you all the time
That I wish for it even thought I know not to.

I will rise up, I will
Who was that phoenix anyway?
Just some bird that flew away
And flies still
Flies still
You know I will
",The Phoenix
Sarah Harmer,"You thank me all the time
But now it's my turn
Cause truly a word of gratitude so due
Can't go unheard
And it made me feel better 
To have you there in my corner
My eyes cast so low
My face could not have been
Drawn longer

I know you've been impressed
You've seen me at my best
But oh, how it hurts
When I can't hide my worst
Well thank-you for carrying on
For playing with me and this song
It made me feel better
We sat it out like some passing bad weather

My mind was like kid's boxing gloves
The kind blown up with air
That are put away after play
And get limp just lying there
But you knew they'd fill up again
And you gave me your shoulder
And I got up in the ring
Because I had you there 
In my corner
And I got up in the ring
Because I had you there
In my corner

Sarah Hudson,"They always said you were unhealthy
Wouldn't be there for me, but I knew different

They always said that you would break me,
Bend me and forsake me, I wouldn't listen

And it was, but it's not anymore
And I'm not as sure as I was before

Tangled up and twisted and oh so tragic
Maybe that was the attraction
Drove me to distraction, but I had to have it

I got carried away, what else can I say?
There I was, I still am
And I don't understand why I'm stuck in the palm of your hand.

Dead ends and dirt roads and miles to walk

Left there by her little self
Quiet as a little mouse

And I believe it's true
But of all the roles that you make up
Don't apply to you

To get up and get out
What she could not see in you

I might get even stranger 

I only see when I don't look
I never want the things I took
I like the pictures in the dirty books
Like a drug, I'll get you hooked
I'm just a little strange

I'm a little bit strange, don't you know
I'm not afraid to tell you so
I'm the next big thing in your little freak show
Don't you know?
I'm a little bit strange, don't you think
My moods can run from black to pink
I'm a little bit strange, but here comes the twist
I actually like it like this",Strange
Sarah Hudson,"I felt in a perfect way
I never had a choice to make
Crest into your tidal wave
I didn't even stroke on
Sail right through your atmosphere
Close my eyes and land it here
I didn't see the trouble
And I didn't care

I can't unlove you
Can't do that
No matter how I tried
I'll never turn my back on someone who loves me too

I can do almost anything I have to
But there's one thing I cannot change
I almost kind of like the pain
I wear your tattoo like a stain
But it will take forever to fade away

I can't unlove you
Can't do that
No matter how I tried
I'll never turn my back on someone who loves me too
I can do almost anything I have to
But I can't unlove you
Oh no, why would I want to
I can't unlove you
Can't do that
I'll never get through that
Why would I want to

There's always time for other dreams
Why must we erase these things

I can't unlove you
Can't do that
No matter how I tried
I'll never turn my back on someone who loves me too
But I can't unlove you
Can't feel that
No matter how I tried
I won't turn my back on someone who loves me too
I can do almost anything I have to
But I can't unlove you",Unlove You
Sarah J. Hyland,"You know like I know you ain't never ever met nobody like me
You know like I know you ain't never ever met nobody like me

[Chorus]
You never met a girl like me
I ain't goin' other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is when you got a down low chick on ya team

[Verse 1]
I might wake you up in the morning and cook for you
If you having problem with a song I'll write a hook for you
11:30 at night I ain't gonna look for you
Cause I know you coming home with me
I will never stress you or make you feel misled
If you want to go to the movies I'll flip it instead
You don't pay me
I get this with my bread my bread
Cause you know my money ain't a thing a thing

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 2]
If you trying to be out to the party I'll let you go
If you want be out with somebody that's when I show
You do as you please cause baby that's how you know that
There's no other place that I'd rather go
I ain't trying to be fussin' and fightin' up on yo' back
Anytime you need me you know that I'm getting yo'back
Ain't no one like me I want you to know that know that
I ain't changing nothing cause it's like that like that

[Bridge]
I know you're used to lovers
That treat you like their mother
So I know it's hard to understand when I say
I'm your girl but I'm like your man
No matter if it's sweet talk or street talk
I'm right here by your side
And soon you'll come to see
How it is to be
Down with a chick like me

[Chorus: x4]",A Girl Like Me
Sarah Jaffe,"How can someone who wants to be loved
hate it when they're loved at all?
Does guilt really feel that bad?
Every time I take a breath, honey
I feel the weight fall back on me
Somebody tell me it's not so bad

Collected thoughts drown in sleep
I had forgotten what you mean to me
I forgot a lot of things

What happens to the old girl, what happens to the boy?
I see their eyelids moving
What happens to the old boy, will he be destroyed?
Is this what I'm losing?
But I feel, feel
But I feel something, oh it's better than nothing

I've been sleeping in his bed
I'm digging in my head
He pulls the cash from under the table
Take that breath and hold it in
Oh it's sidling in, he says
It's not so bad

Collected thoughts drown in sleep
I had forgotten what you mean to me
I forgot a lot of things

What happens to the old girl, what happens to the boy?
I see their eyelids moving
What happens to the old boy, will he be destroyed?
Is this what I'm losing?
But I feel, feel
But I feel something, oh it's better than nothing
How can someone who wants to be loved
hate it when they're loved at all?
Does guilt really feel that bad?
Every time I take a breath, honey
I feel the weight fall back on me
Somebody tell me it's not so bad

Collected thoughts drown in sleep
I had forgotten what you mean to me
I forgot a lot of things

What happens to the old girl, what happens to the boy?
I see their eyelids moving
What happens to the old boy, will he be destroyed?
Is this what I'm losing?
But I feel, feel
But I feel something, oh it's better than nothing

I've been sleeping in his bed
I'm digging in my head
He pulls the cash from under the table
Take that breath and hold it in
Oh it's sidling in, he says
It's not so bad

Collected thoughts drown in sleep
I had forgotten what you mean to me
I forgot a lot of things

What happens to the old girl, what happens to the boy?
I see their eyelids moving
What happens to the old boy, will he be destroyed?
Is this what I'm losing?
But I feel, feel
But I feel something, oh it's better than nothing",Better Than Nothing
