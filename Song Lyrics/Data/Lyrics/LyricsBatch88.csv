Ella Fitzgerald,"If dreams come true
I'll be with you
I love that smile in your eyes
You see a dream in the skies
In your caress there is happiness
And love in view
If dreams come true",If Dreams Come True
Ella Fitzgerald,"A little bit later on
A little bit later on
Just wait and you'll see
How lonely you'll be
A little bit later on

Just wait till you start missin'
My huggin' and my kissin'
Now, baby, better listen
You'll be cryin', boo, hoo, hoo

A little bit later on
You're gonna wake up some day
And open your eyes
To a great big surprise, baby

Don't forget it
You'll regret it
After I'm gone

You'd better think twice
It won't be so nice
A little bit later on

Oh, a little bit later on
Say you're gonna wake up some day
And open your eyes
To a great big surprise, my baby

Don't forget it
You'll regret it
After I'm gone

You'd better think twice
It won't be so nice
A little bit later on",A Little Bit Later On
Ella Fitzgerald,"Every star above
Knows the one I love
Sweet Sue, just you

And the moon on high
Knows the reason why
Sweet Sue, is you

No one else it seems
Ever shared my dreams
Without you I don't know what I'd do

In this heart of mine
You live all the time
Oh, Sue, just you","Sweet Sue, Just You"
Ella Fitzgerald,"How glad the many millions
Of Timothy's and William's
Would be, to capture me
But you had such persistence
You wore down my resistance
I fell, and it was swell
You're my big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you I shall never, never know
It's not that you're attractive
But oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view

I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and nighttime, hear me sigh
I never had the least notion
That I could fall with such emotion
Could you coo, could you care
For a cunning cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I've got a crush, my baby, on you

Could you coo, could you care
For a cunning cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I've got a crush, my baby, on you",I've Got a Crush on You
Ella Fitzgerald,"The more I see you
The more I want you
Somehow this feeling
Just grows and grows
With every sigh I become
More mad about you
More lost without you
And so it goes
Can you imagine
How much I love you?
The more I see you
As years go by
I know the only one for me
Can only be you
My arms won't free you
And my heart won't try

Each time I look at you
Is like the first time
Each time you're near me
The thrill is new
And there is not a single thing I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you
And there is not one single thing
I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you
And the more I see you
The more I see you
The more I see you
The more I see you
The more I see you
The more I see you
The more I see you
The more I see you
And the more I see you
The more I see you
The more I see you
The more I see you
The more I see you
Everyday",The More I See You
Ella Fitzgerald,"A-tisket, a-tasket
A green and yellow basket
I send a letter to my mommy
On the way I dropped it

I dropped it, I dropped it
Yes, on the way I dropped it
A little girlie picked it up
And took put it in her pocket

She was truckin' on down the avenue
Without a single thing to do
She went peck, peck, peckin' all around
When she spied it on the ground

She took it, she took it
She took my yellow basket
And if she doesn't bring it back
I think that I would die

A-tisket, a-tasket
A green and yellow basket
And if that girlie don't return it
Don't know what I'll do

Oh dear, I wonder where my basket can be
Oh gee, I wish that little girl I could see
Oh, why was I so careless with that basket of mine
That itty-bitty basket was a joy of mine

A-tisket, a-tasket
I lost my yellow basket
Won't someone help me find my basket
And make me happy again

(Was it green?) no no no no
(Was it red?) no no no no
(Was it blue?) no no no no
Just a little yellow basket

A little yellow basket","A-Tisket, A-Tasket"
Ella Fitzgerald,"You got a gal you love on Sunday
Then you get another for Monday

Ain't nobody's business but my own

You say you're always home alone
How come I can't get you on the phone?

Well, that ain't nobody's business but my own

Nobody's business
Nobody's business
Nobody's business but my own
Nobody's business
Nobody's business
Nobody's business but my own

All night long you're playin' poker
Tell me, what's the name of that joker?

Ain't nobody's business but my own

I come over, say, ""Here I am""
Then I hear the back door slam

Well, that ain't nobody's business but my own

[Chorus]
Nobody's business
Nobody's business
Nobody's business but my own
Nobody's business
Nobody's business
Nobody's business but my own

You tell me you're in bed by seven
But your light's on past eleven

Well, that ain't nobody's business but my own

Now you ain't so smart and you ain't good lookin'
How come you got so much cookin'?

Ain't nobody's business but my own

[Chorus]

And you wear the prettiest ties and collars
Whereabouts do you get those dollars?

Ain't nobody's business but my own

You always talk about settlin' down
When I bring a ring, you're not around

Well, I'll be there the next time that you call

Well, let's not fuss and let's not fight

I'm sick and tired of sayin' goodnight

Well, let's make up and hold each other tight

We both know we're birds of a feather
Let's go into business together
We can start a business of our own

[Chorus]",Ain't Nobody's Business But My Own
Ella Fitzgerald,"Left New York this morning early
Traveling south so wide and high
Sailing through the wide blue yonder
It's that air mail special on the fly

Listen to the motors humming
She is streaking through the sky
Like a bird that's flying homeward
It's that air mail special on the fly

Over plains and high dark mountains
Over rivers deep and wide
Carrying mail to California
It's that air mail special on the fly

Watch her circle for the landing
Hear her moan and cough and sigh
Now she's coming down the runway
It's that air mail special on the fly",Air Mail Special
Ella Fitzgerald,"I try to think that love's not around
But it's uncomfortably near
My old heart ain't gaining no ground
Because my angel eyes ain't here

Angel eyes, that old devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's misspent
Misspent with angel eyes tonight

So drink up all you people
Order anything you see
Have fun you happy people
The laughs and the jokes on me

Pardon me but I got to run
The fact's uncommonly clear
Got to find who's now number one
And why my angel eyes
Oh, where is my angel eyes

Excuse me while I disappear",Angel Eyes
Ella Fitzgerald,"Won't you come along with me
To the Mississippi
We'll take a boat to the land of dreams
Steam down the river, down to New Orleans

The band's there to meet us
Old friends there to greet us
Where all the proud and elite folks meet
Heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street

Basin Street is the street
Where the best folks always meet
In New Orleans, land of dreams
You'll never know how nice it seems
Or just how much it really means

Glad to be, oh yes-sire
Where welcome's free and dear to me
Where I can lose, lose my Basin Street Blues

Basin Street, oh Basin Street
Is the street, mama (scat)
New Orleans, land of dreams",Basin Street Blues
Ella Fitzgerald,"I'm feeling mighty lonesome
Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor and watch the door
And in between I drink
Black coffee
Love's a hand me down brew
I'll never know a Sunday
In this weekday room

I'm talking to the shadows
From 1 o'clock til 4
And lord, how slow the moments go
When all I do is pour
Black coffee
Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hanging out on Monday
My Sunday dreams to dry

Now a man is born to go a lovin'
A woman's born to weep and fret
To stay at home and tend her oven
And drown her past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes

I'm moaning all the morning
And mourning all the night
And in between it's nicotine
And not much heart to fight
Black coffee
Feelin' low as the ground
It's driving me crazy just waiting for my baby
To maybe come around... around
I'm waiting for my baby
To maybe come around

My nerves have gone to pieces
My hair is turning gray
All I do is drink black coffee
Since my man's gone away
",Black Coffee
Ella Fitzgerald,"Out on the plains down near Santa Fe
I met a cowboy ridin' the range one day
And as he jogged along I heard him singin'
The most peculiar cowboy song
It was a ditty, he learned in the city
Comma ti yi yi yeah
Comma ti yippity yi yeah

Now get along, get hip little doggies
Get along, better be on your way
Get along, get hip little doggies
He trucked 'em on down that old fairway
Singin' his Cow Cow Boogie in the strangest way
Comma ti yi yi yeah
Comma ti yippity yi yeah

[Chorus: x2]
Now singin' his cowboy songs
He's just too much
He's got a knocked out western accent with a dixie 
Touch
He was raised on local ways
He's what you call a swingin' half breed
Singin' his Cow Cow Booogie in the strangest way
Comma ti yi yi yeah
Comma ti yippity yi yeah",Cow Cow Boogie
Ella Fitzgerald,"Don't worry 'bout me
I'll get along
Forget about me
Just be happy my love

Let's say that our little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way
And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love
To whomever you love
Darlin' don't be a fool

Why do we cling to this old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then don't worry 'bout me

Why should we cling to some old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then you don't worry 'bout me",Don't Worry 'Bout Me
Ella Fitzgerald,"Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""
Birds singing in the sycamore trees
Dream a little dream of me

Say nighty-night and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams, till sunbeams find you
Gotta keep dreaming leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
You gotta make me a promise, promise to me
You'll dream, dream a little of me",Dream a Little Dream of Me
Ella Fitzgerald,"The five o'clock whistle's on the blink
The whistle won't blow and whadd'ya think?
My pop is still in the factory 'cause he don't know
What time it happens to be

The five o'clock whistle didn't blow
The whistle is broke and whadda'ya know?
If somebody don't find out what's wrong
Oh, my pop'll be workin' all night long

Oh, who's gonna fix the whistle?
Won't somebody fix the whistle?
Oh, who's gonna fix the whistle?
So my poor old pop will know it's time for him to stop

Ya ought to hear what my mommy said
When papa came home and sneaked into bed
And told her he worked till half past two
Cause the five o'clock whistle never blew",Five O'Clock Whistle
Ella Fitzgerald,"In old Savannah
I said Savannah
The weather there is nice and warm
The climate`s of a southern brand

But here`s what I don`t understand
They`ve got a gal there
A pretty gal there
Who`s colder than an artic storm

Got a heart just like a stone
Even nice men leave her alone
They call her ""hard hearted Hannah""
The vamp of Savannah

The meanest gal in town
Leather is tough, but Hannah`s heart is tougher
She`s a gal who loves to see men suffer
To tease them and thrill `em

To torture and kill `em
Is her delight they say
I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan
There was Hannah pourin` water on a drownin` man

She`s hard hearted Hannah
The vamp of Savannah, G-A
The call her ""hard hearted Hannah""
The vamp of Savannah

The meanest gal in town
Talk of your cold, refridgerating mamas
Brotha she`s a polar bear`s pajamas
To tease them and thrill `em

To torture and kill `em
Is her delight they say
An evening spent with Hannah sitting on your knees
Is like travelin` through Alaska in your BVDs

She`s hard hearted Hannah 
The vamp of Savannah, G-A
Can you imagine a woman as cold as Hannah?
She`s got the right name ""the vamp of Savannah""

Anytime a woman can take a great big pan
Start pourin` water on a drownin` man
She`s hard hearted Hannah
The vamp of Savannah, G-A

Spoken: Ooh! She`s sweet as sour milk.",Hard Hearted Hannah
Ella Fitzgerald,"I didn't mean a word I said
And if I hurt you I'm sorry
I didn't mean to lose my head
And if made you cry I'm sorry
It was just another foolish quarrel
Won't you end it with a kiss and 
Just remember this
Except the time I said I love you
I didn't mean a word I said
I didn't mean a word I said

I didn't mean a word I said
And if I hurt you I'm so so sorry so so so sorry
I didn't mean to lose my head
And if made you cry I'm sorry

Ella Fitzgerald,"I wished on the moon
For something I never knew
Wished on the moon
For more than I ever knew
A sweeter rose, a softer sky
On April days that would not dance by
I begged on the stars
To throw me a beam or two
Wished on the stars
And asked for a dream or two
I looked for every loveliness
It all came true
I wished on the moon for you",I Wished on the Moon
Ella Fitzgerald,"I've got the world on a string, sittin' on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love!
I've got a song that I sing

I can make the rain go, anytime I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see, I'm in love
Life is a beautiful thing, as long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so and so, if I should ever let go

I've got the world on a string, sittin' on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love
 
Life is a beautiful thing, as long as I hold the string

When that evening sun goes down
I want you, be around

I want you, understand
Little girl, take me by my hand
I want you, understand
I wanna be your loving man
When that evening sun goes down

Ella Fitzgerald,"Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is falling in mine
Into each heart some tears must fall
But some day the sun will shine
Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts
But when I think of you another shower starts
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is falling in mine

Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is falling in mine
Into each heart some tears must fall
But some day the sun will shine
Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts

Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is falling in mine

Into each and every life some rain has got to fall
But too much of that stuff is fallin' into mine
And into each heart some tears gotta fall
And I know that someday that sun is bound to shine

But when I think of you, another shower starts
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is falling in mine",Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall
Ella Fitzgerald,"Lover, when I`m near you, and I hear you, speak my name
Softly, in my ear you, breathe a flame

Lover, when we`re dancing, keep on glancing, in my eyes
Till loves own entrancing, music dies

All of my future is in you
Your every plan I design
Promise you`ll always continue
To be mine

Lover, please be tender, when you`re tender, fears depart
Lover, I surrender, to my heart

(instrumental bridge)
Lover, it`s immoral, but why quarrel, with our bliss
When, two lips of coral, want to kiss

I say the devil is in you, and to resist you, I try
But if you didn`t continue, I would die

Lover, please be tender, when you`re tender, fears depart
Lover, I surrender, to my heart","Lover, Come Back to Me"
Ella Fitzgerald,"Evening shadows make me blue
When each weary day is through
How I long to be with you
My happiness

Every day I reminisce
Dreaming of your tender kiss
Always thinking how I miss
My happiness

A million years it seems
Have gone by since we shared our dreams
But I'll hold you again
There'll be no blue memories then

Whether skies are gray or blue
Any place on earth will do
Just as long as I'm with you
My happiness

Evening shadows make me blue
When each weary day is through
How I long to be with you

Every day I reminisce
Dreaming of your tender kiss
Always thinking how I miss
My happiness

A million years it seems
Have gone by since we shared our dreams
But I'll hold you again
There'll be no blue memories then

Whether skies are gray or blue
Any place on earth will do
Just as long as I'm with you

Ella Fitzgerald,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love
Ella Fitzgerald,"I look at you and suddenly something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon that you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and your glance make this romance too hot to handle
Stars in the night blazing their light can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle
You've got me flyin' high and wide on a magic carpet ride

Full of butterflies inside
Want to cry, want to croon, want to laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes
Just when I think I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon, deep in your eyes, blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon
Ella Fitzgerald,"We didn't break apart in stormy weather
We didn't run around like others do
Now we're not afraid when storm clouds gather
'Cause we got the kind of love that'll see us through

[Chorus]
We've got smooth sailing, sailing
Looks like every drop of rain is gone, gone, gone
Smooth sailing, sailing
And a blue sky full of rainbows from now on

We find each others arms in troubled waters
We found that's the safest place to go
From now we can laugh at troubled waters
'Cause our roughest storms just seem to make love grow

Ella Fitzgerald,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!
Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the stars",Stairway to the Stars

And then you won't

And when you say you'll stay
That's when you go

Be a beggar or a knave for you?

Gladly move the earth for you
Prove my love, dear, and it's worth it for you
If that isn't love, it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along 

With all the words, dear, at my command
I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you, baby, come what may
My heart is yours--what more can I say?

I would cry for you, even sigh for you
Tear those stars down from the sky for you
If that isn't love, it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along 

Walk on burning coals for you
I would drive the Chrysler, leave the Rolls for you
If that ain't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along 

I would try to hit high C for you
I'd even punch out Mr. T for you
If that ain't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along 

There's not a thing that you can't ask of me
Go on, demand any task of me
If you want the moon or a lavaliere
All you got to do is nibble on my ear

I would rob, steal, beg, borrow, and lie for you
Lay my little body down and die for you

If that ain't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along",Until the Real Thing Comes Along
Ella Fitzgerald,"Smooth road, clear day
But why am I the only one travelin' this way?
How strange--the road to love should be so easy
Can't you see the detour ahead?

Wake up, slow down
Before you crash and break your heart, gullible clown
You fool, you're headed in the wrong direction
Can't you see the detour ahead?

The further you travel, the harder to unravel the web
She spins around you
Turn back while there's time
Don't you see the danger sign?
Soft shoulders surround you

Smooth road, clear night
Oh, lucky me that suddenly I saw the light
I'm turning back away from all that sorrow
Smooth road, clear day
No detour ahead

The further you travel, the harder to unravel the web
She spins around you
Turn back while there's time
Don't you see the danger sign?

You've got a reason to be mad I suppose
But she only was a passing fad
Baby, don'cha be mad

Her kind's a dime a dozen
And that's not the kind I want (I should have passed her by)
Who'd ever dream your cousin
Would wander in to that restaurant (would come along and give us the eye)?

I understand that you feel (you're quite) upset
What do you say that you forgive and forget?
Come on and kiss me just to show your glad

Ella Fitzgerald,"Smooth road, clear day
But why am I the only one travelin' this way?
How strange--the road to love should be so easy
Can't you see the detour ahead?

Wake up, slow down
Before you crash and break your heart, gullible clown
You fool, you're headed in the wrong direction
Can't you see the detour ahead?

The further you travel, the harder to unravel the web
She spins around you
Turn back while there's time
Don't you see the danger sign?
Soft shoulders surround you

Oh, lucky me that suddenly I saw the light
I'm turning back away from all that sorrow

I fell in love with you heart and soul
Because you held me tight
And stole a kiss in the night

Heart and soul
I begged to be adored
I lost control and tumbled overboard gladly
That magic night we kissed
There in the moon mist
Oh, but your lips were thrilling, much too thrilling
Never before were mine so faintly willing
But now I see what one embrace can do
That little kiss you stole
Held all my heart and soul

Now I see what one embrace can do
Look at me; it's got me loving you madly

Held all my heart and soul",Heart and Soul [#]

Those leftover dreams

Where is that worn out wish
That I threw aside
After it brought my love so near

And all you hear are castanets
And no one cares how late it gets
Not at Hernando's hideaway, a-way!

You will meet your Uncle Max and everyone you know
But if you go to the spot that I am thinking of

That you and I were sent by Joe

Cars and houses, bear-skin rugs to lie before my fire
But there's something missing,
Something isn't there,
It seems I'm never kissing the one whom I care for.
I want Something To Live For
Someone to make my life an adventurous dream
Oh, what wouldn't I give for 
Someone who'd take my life 
And make it seem gay as they say it ought to be.
Why can't I have love like that brought to me?
My eye is watching the noon crowds 
Searching the promenades seeking a clue
To the one who will someday be my 
Something To Live For.

Ella Fitzgerald,"Along the mountain pass 
There is a patch of grass 
Where the swingin' shepherd plays a tune 
His sheep never stray 
Dancin' all day 
Until they see the palin' yellow moon 
And then he leads his flock 
And homeward they all rock 
To the tune of the swingin' shepherd blues 

This I-is something really extra special 
A ditty we like to do just for you 
It's the onliest swinginest grooviest thingy that we've ever done

Ella Fitzgerald,"Such a bad thing to run away from my mother 
Right into the arms of a lover
I should walk away from you in my brand new shoes
Because I'm just too young, too young for the blues
I'm a baby, and your kiss is so tender
I'm a big fool if I ever surrender

I'll come back some day when I learn the rules
Because I'm just too young, too young for the blues
Soon enough the blues will come and break my heart 
So I'll make my getaway before the teardrops start
It's a hard game and I'm just a beginner
Why play if the blues is the winner
If I stick around I know I'll lose

You've changed
That sparkle in your eyes is gone
Your smile is just a careless yawn
You're breaking my heart

And a thousand violins begin to play,
Or it might be the sound of your hello,
That music I hear,

I get misty, the moment you`re near.
Can`t you see that you`re leading me on?
And it`s just what I want you to do,
Don`t you notice how hopelessly I`m lost

That`s why I`m following you.
On my own,
When I wander through this wonderland alone,
Never knowing my right foot from my left

My hat from my glove

Too misty,
And too much

To throw out the life line, his peril to share?

Throw out the life line! Throw out the life line!
Someone is drifting away;
Throw out the life line! Throw out the life line!
Someone is sinking today.

Throw out the life line with hand quick and strong:
Why do you tarry, why linger so long?
See! he is sinking; oh, hasten today
And out with the life boat! away, then away!

Throw out the life line to danger fraught men,
Sinking in anguish where you've never been;
Winds of temptation and billows of woe
Will soon hurl them out where the dark waters flow.

Soon will the season of rescue be o'er,
Soon will they drift to eternity's shore;
Haste, then, my brother, no time for delay,
But throw out the life line and save them today.

This is the life line, oh, tempest tossed men;
Baffled by waves of temptation and sin;
Wild winds of passion, your strength cannot brave,
But Jesus is mighty, and Jesus can save.

Jesus is able! To you who are driv'n,
Farther and farther from God and from Heav'n;
Helpless and hopeless, o'erwhelmed by the wave;
We throw out the life line, 'tis 'Jesus can save.'

This is the life line, oh, grasp it today!
See, you are recklessly drifting away;
Voices in warning, shout over the wave,
O grasp the strong life line, for Jesus can save.",Throw Out the Lifeline

That you thrill me through, with a tender pash
When you said you care 'magine my emoshe

You made all other men seem blah
Just you alone filled me with ah

'S wonderful, 's marvelous
You should care for me
'S awful nice, 's paradise

You've made my life so glamorous
You can't blame me for feeling amorous
Oh, 's wonderful, 's marvelous

'S elegant, 's what I want

Ella Fitzgerald,"Somethings gotta give,
Somethings gotta give
Somethings gotta give
When an irresistible force such as you

Meets and old immovable object like me
You can bet as sure as you live
Something's gotta give, something's gotta give,
Something's gotta give.

When an irrepressible smile such as yours
Warms an old implacable heart such as mine
Don't say no because I insist.
Somewhere, somehow,
Someone's gonna be kissed.

So en garde who knows what the fates have in store
From their vast mysterious sky?
I'll try hard ignoring those lips I adore
But how long can anyone try?

Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight it with all of our might,
Chances are some heavenly star spangled night
We'll find out as sure as we live
Something's gotta give, something's gotta give,
Something's gotta give.

Ella Fitzgerald,"Our romance won't end on a sorrowful note
Though by tomorrow you're gone
The song has ended but as the songwriter wrote
The melody lingers on

They may take you from me
I'll miss your fond caress
But though they take you from me
I'll still possess

The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no, they can't take that away from me
The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no, they can't take that away from me

We may never never meet again
on that bumpy road to love
Still I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life

No, they can't take that away
No, they can't take that away
No, they can't take that away from me",They Can't Take That Away from Me
Ella Fitzgerald,"Spending these lonesome evenings
With nothing to do
But to live in dreams that I make up
All by myself

Dreaming that you're beside me
I picture the prettiest stories
Only to wake up
All by myself

What is the good of me by myself?

Why was I born?
Why am I living?
What do I get?
What am I giving?

Why do I want a thing
I daren't hope for?
What can I hope for?
I wish I knew

Why do I try
To draw you near me?
Why do I do I cry?
You never hear me

I'm a poor fool
But what can I do?
Why was I born
To love you?

I'm a poor fool
But what can I do?
Why was I born
To love you?",Why Was I Born?
Ella Fitzgerald,"At any gambling casino
From Monte Carlo to Reno
They tell you that a beginner
Comes out a winner

Beginner fishing for flounder
Will catch a 17 pounder
That's what I always heard
And thought absurd,

But now, I believe every word
For I've got beginner's luck
The first time that I'm in love
I'm in love with you

Gosh, I'm lucky
I've got beginner's luck
There never was such a smile
Or such eyes of blue

Gosh, I'm fortunate
The thing we've begun
Is much more than a pastime
For this time is the one

Ella Fitzgerald,"Oh, it really wasn't my intention
To disregard convention
It was just an impulse
That had to be obeyed
Though it seems convention we've been scorning
I'll still not go in mourning
Though my reputation
Is blemished, I'm afraid
With just one kiss
What heaven, what rapture, what bliss
Honestly, I thought you wouldn't
Naturally, you thought you couldn't
And probably we shouldn't
But aren't you kind of glad we did?
Actually, it all was blameless
Nevertheless, they'll call it shameless
So let's keep the lady nameless
But aren't you kind of glad we did?
Socially, I'll be an outcast
Obviously, we dined alone
On my good name there will be doubt cast
With never a sign of any chaperon
No matter how they may construe it
Whether or not, we have to rue it
Whatever made us do it
Say, aren't you kind of glad we did?

Ella Fitzgerald,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for

And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold

Blue moon now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

And then there suddenly appeared before me

Ella Fitzgerald,"I've just finished writing an advertisement

He must make life a romance.

One who can smile;
Boy wanted, lovable style.

He must know how to say ""Yes!""

Oh, I`ll be ready when the right one calls,

Verse:
I`ve just finished writing an advertisement
Calling for a boy.
No half-hearted Romeo or flirt is meant;
That`s the kind I won`t employ.
Though anybody interested can apply,
He must know a thing to qualify.
For instance:

Refrain 1:
To have a ghost of a chance,
He must be able to dance.
The sort of boy wanted
Must have a smile
Boy wanted,
Lovable style.
He must be tender and true,
And if he knows what to do,
I think I`ll learn to love him very soon;
I`ll want him morning, night and afternoon.
So if you know of one who`s wanting employment,
Just tell him that
I`m wanting a boy!

Refrain 2:
To be the boy of my choice,
He`s got to own a Rolls Royce.
He must be quite reckless
Buying me things:
Pearl necklace,
Diamond rings.
He must be ready to pay
A dozen bills ev`ry day.
I`ll simply smothing him with tender care
If I could find a multimillionaire.
So if you could seen one dining at the Savoy-oh!
Just tell him
I`m wanting a boy!

Refrain 3:
I won`t have anyone small,
He must be handsome and tall.
I said a boy wanted,
Beautifully dressed;
Boy wanted,
Trousers well pressed.
He must have wonderful eyes;
He must wear wonderful ties.
I want a boy who`ll always look as though
He`s only just come out of Savile Row.
So if some Paris wants a Helen of Troy-oh!
Just tell him that
I`m wanting a boy.",Boy Wanted
Ella Fitzgerald,"I fetch his slippers, fill up the pipe he smokes
I cook the kippers, laugh at his oldest jokes
Yet here I anchor, I might have had a banker
Boy! what love has done to me

His nature`s funny, quarrelsome half the time
And as for money, he hasn`t got a dime
And here`s the joker, I might have had a broker
Boy! what love has done to me

When a guy looks my way
Does he get emphatic, say he gets dramatic?
I just want to fly `way
But if I left him I`d be all at sea

I`m just a slavery, life is a funny thing
He`s got the gravy, I got a wedding ring
And still I love him, there`s nobody above him
Boy! what love has done to me

His brains are minus,
Never a thought in sight
And yet his highness
Lectures me day and night;
Oh where was my sense
To sign that wedding license?
Boy! What love has done to me!

My life he`s wrecking, bet you could find him now
Out somewhere necking somebody else`s frau
You get to know life when married to a low life
Boy! what love has done to me

I can`t hold my head up
The butcher, the baker, oh no he`s a faker
Brother I am fed up
But if I left him he`d be up a tree

Where will it wind up, I don`t know where I`m at
I make my mind up, I oughta leave him flat
But I have grown so, I love that dirty so-and-so
Boy! what love has done to me",Boy! What Love Has Done to Me!
Ella Fitzgerald,"Paradise can not refuse us
Never such a happy pair

Everybody must excuse us
If we walk on air

All the shadows now will lose us
Lucky stars are everywhere

As a happy being
Here's what I'm foreseeing

For you, for me, forever more
It's bound to be forever more

We found, by finding each other
The love we waited for

I'm yours, you're mine
And in our hearts
The happy ending starts

This world will be
With a world of love in store

Oh, I'm all at sea

I'm jittery
I'm twittery
I guess I'm done for
I guess I'm through
And it's something about which there's nothing anyone can do

Why did I take that trip
That made me lose my grip?

Which I heard only last Septum-bah
I'm a wreck, why did I have to succumb-bah
Can you imagine anything dumb-bah?
Why did I have to succumb-bah

But it turned out a Cuban Frankenstein-ah

Ella Fitzgerald,"I didn't mean to,
Start any scene to
Make you sigh

It's most immoral
For us to quarrel
Why can't we
Both agree

On the proposition that in union there is strength?
Why raise a storm up
If we'll just warm up

The blues will slumber
We'll have their number

Come on, let's wake up

For I need you and you need me

Lets make it rosy
By reuniting
Two heads are better

All the night and day
Feeling as they never felt before
What is the thing

It plays a part in every heart
And every heart is shouting, ""Encore""

Love is sweeping the country,
Waves are hugging the shore,

From Maine to Texas

Sharing joy alike
Feels that passion` ll
Soon be national!

Who could make my life complete, by dreams come true

The many men I`d known for years all seemed the same
They kept on boring me to tears, and then you came

I was above love before,
But now I love love, because you`re

Ella Fitzgerald,"Near Barcelona the peasant crooned

With folk songs plaintive and others gay

American folk songs, I feel
Have a much stronger appeal

Than a classic strain; boy, you can't remain still or quiet, for it's a riot

Ella Fitzgerald,"Delilah was a floozy
She never gave a damn
Delilah wasn't choosy
Till she fell for a swell buckaroo
Whose name was Sam
Delilah got in action
Delilah did her ""kootch""
She gave him satisfaction
And he fell 'neath her spell
With the aid of love and ""hootch""
But one day, so they tell us
His true wife, he did crave
Delilah, she got jealous
And she tracked him, and hacked him
And dug for Sam a grave

Or else, you're liable to cash in

Shall she weep and sigh?
No, no, and I'll tell you why

Someday, there must come somebody
Bringing heaven in view
And so her courage, she must keep
As she sings herself to sleep

Somebody from somewhere
Will appear someday
I don't know just from where
But he's on his way

I'll just keep on waiting
Waiting 'till I see
Somebody from somewhere
For nobody but me

(instrumental bridge)

I'll just keep on waiting
Waiting 'till I see
Somebody from somewhere
For nobody but me

Ella Fitzgerald,"What made good queen Bess
Such a great success?
What made Wellington
Do what he did at Waterloo?

What makes every Englishman
A fighter through and through?
It isn't roast beef, or ale, or home, or mother
It`s just a little thing they sing to one another

Stiff upper lip, stout fella
Carry on, old fluff
Chin up, keep muddling through

Stiff upper lip, stout fella
When the going`s rough
Pip pip to old man trouble
And a toodly-oo too

Carry on through thick and thin
If you feel you`re in the right
Does the fighting spirit win?
Quite, quite, quite, quite, quite

Stiff upper lip, stout fella
When you`re in the stew
Sober or blotto, this is your motto
Keep muddling through

When a bounder starts to hiss
You must give him blow for blow
Make the blighter say, ""What`s this?
`ullo, `ullo, `ullo, `ullo, `ullo""

Ella Fitzgerald,"When I was born, they found a silver spoon in my mouth
And so I always had the best of care
When winter came up north, of course they motored me south
Where I was princess in our villa there

Tutors and headwaiters fawned on me
Life was just a bore till it dawned on me
The cushy sheltered way of life was really no fun
From now on, some manhandling must be done

So treat me rough
Muss my hair
Don't you dare to handle me with care
I'm no innocent child, baby
Keep on treating me wild

Treat me rough
Pinch my cheek
Kiss and hug and squeeze me
'till I'm weak

I've been pampered enough, baby
Keep on treatin' me rough

Treat me rough
Pinch my cheek

Ella Fitzgerald,"The world is lyrical
Because a miracle
Has brought my lover to me
Though she's some other place, her face I see

At night I creep in bed
And never sleep in bed
But look above in the air
And to my greatest joy, my love is there

She dances overhead
On the ceiling near my bed
In my sight
All through the night

I try to hide in vain
Underneath my counterpane
But there's my love
Up there above

I whisper, ""Go away, my lover
It's not fair""
But I'm so grateful to discover
That she's still there

I love my ceiling more
Since it is a dancing floor
Just for my love",Dancing on the Ceiling (He Dances on My Ceiling)
Ella Fitzgerald,"Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore

Thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless, why stir up memories?

Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for
Awfully different without you

Ella Fitzgerald,"Get in touch with that sundown fellow
As he tiptoes across the sand
He's got a million kinds of stardust

Dream, that's the thing to do
Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air
You'll find your share of memories there

So dream when the day is through
Dream, and they might come true
Things never are as bad as they seem

That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day
And everything's o.k.

Isn't this a lovely day

Now you've got to remain

For me and for you
I feel that it's true somehow

Can't you see that cabin in the sky, Mister
An acre or two of heavenly blue to plow?

And feed you winter fruits and summer wine
Show you things you've only read in story books
If I thought you'd ever change your mind

Wrapped up in a box and tied with a yellow bow
I would bring you summer rain and rainbow skies to make your garden grow
And in the winter snow my songs would keep you from the cold

When the garden they should grow in is not mine
And what use is sunshine if I'm crying

Ella Fitzgerald,"What now, my love, now that you left me?
How can I live through another day
Watching my dreams turn into ashes
And all my hopes into bits of clay?
Once I could see, once I could feel
Now I am numb; I've become unreal

I walk the night, oh, without a goal
Stripped of my heart, my soul
What now, my love, now that it's over?
I feel the world closing in on me
Here come the stars tumbling around me
And there's the sky where the sea should be

What now, my love, now that you're gone?
I'd be a fool to go on and on
No one would care, no one would cry
If I should live or die
What now, my love, now there is nothing?
Only my last goodbye, only my last goodbye",What Now My Love
Ella Fitzgerald,"Here we are on earth together
It's you and I
God has made us fall in love, it's true
I've really found someone like you 

Will it say the love you feel for me, will it say
That you will be by my side 
To see me through
Until my life is through 

Well, in my mind, we can conquer the world
In love you and I, you and I, you and I 
I am glad at least in my life I found someone 
That may not be here forever to see me through

But I found strength in you
I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day
Because that's all that I am living for, you see
Don't worry what happens to me

Ella Fitzgerald,"What good is sitting, alone in your room?
But come, hear the music play!
Life is a cabaret, old chum!
Come to the cabaret!
Put down your knitting, your book and your broom
It is time for a holiday
Life is a cabaret, old chum!

Come to the cabaret!
Come taste the wine
Come hear the band 
Come blow that horn
Start celebrating
Right this way your table's waiting
What good's permitting some prophet of doom?
To wipe every smile away
Life is a cabaret, old chum!
So come to the cabaret!

I used to have this girlfriend known as Elsie
With whom I shared for sordid rooms in Chelsea
She wasn't what you call a blushing flower
As a matter of fact she rented by the hours
The day she died the neighbours
Came to snicker her
Well, that is what comes from 
Too much pills and liquor

But when I saw her laid down like  a queen
She was the happiest corpes I'd ever seen
I think of Elsie till this very day
I remember how she'd turned to me and say
What good is sitting all alone in your room?
Come hear the music play
Life is a cabaret, old chum!
Come to the cabaret!

And as for me 
And as for me
I made my mind up back in Chelsea
When I go I am going like Elsie
Start by admitting
From cradle to doom
It isn't that long a stay 
Life is a cabaret, old chum!
It's only a cabaret, old chum!
And I love a cabaret!",Cabaret
Ella Fitzgerald,"People, people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world

We're children needing other children
And yet letting our grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children

Lovers are very special people
They're the luckiest people in the world

Says you were half, now you're whole

Ella Fitzgerald,"Once I was a sentimental thing,
Threw my heart away each spring,
Now a spring romance hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to winter,
All I've got to show?s a splinter for my little fling!

Spring this year has got me feeling like a horse that never left the post,
I lie in my room staring up at the ceiling,
Spring can really hang you up the most!

Morning?s kiss wakes tres and flowers,
And to them I'd like to drink a toast,
I walk in the park just to kill lonely hours,
Spring can really hang you up the most.

All afternoon those birds twitter twit,
I know the tune, ""this is love, this is it!""
Heard it before and I know the score,
And I've decided that spring is a bore!

Love seemed sure around the new year,
Now it's April, love is just a ghost,
Spring arrived on time, only what became of you, dear? 
Spring can really hang you up the most!
Spring can really hang you up the most!

Spring is here, there?s no mistaking
Robins building nests from coast to coast;
My heart tries to sing so they won?t hear it breaking,
Spring can really hang you up the most!

College boys are writing sonnets,
In the ""tender passion"" they're engrossed,
But I'm on the shelf with last years Easter bonnets,
Spring can really hang you up the most!

Love came my way, I hope it would last,
We had our day, now that's all in the past!
Spring came along a season of son,
Full of sweet promise but something went wrong!

Doctors once prescribed a tonic,
""sulfur and molasses"" was the dose,
Didn't help a bit, my condition must be chronic,
Spring can really hang you up the most!

All alone, the party's over,
Old man winter was a gracious host,
But when you keep praying for snow to hide the clover
Spring can really hang you up the most!",Spring Can Really Hang You Upthe Most
Ella Fitzgerald,"A-tisket, a-tasket
A green and yellow basket
I send a letter to my mommy
On the way I dropped it

I dropped it, I dropped it
Yes, on the way I dropped it
A little girlie picked it up
And took put it in her pocket

She was truckin' on down the avenue
Without a single thing to do
She went peck, peck, peckin' all around
When she spied it on the ground

She took it, she took it
She took my yellow basket
And if she doesn't bring it back
I think that I would die

And if that girlie don't return it
Don't know what I'll do

Oh dear, I wonder where my basket can be
Oh gee, I wish that little girl I could see
Oh, why was I so careless with that basket of mine
That itty-bitty basket was a joy of mine

Won't someone help me find my basket

Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air

Ella Fitzgerald,"I went down to the dance
Such a clown by the wall
Invited to dance
By no one at all

The couples danced fine
So charming and gay
But nobody wants
To look over my way

So awfully sad
Dissatisfied
I hurt so bad
I almost cried
Imagine my frustration with no
Invitation to dance

Head high, standing tall
Who else, who else could I be?
But Ella next to the wall
A fella who likes what they see?

And then in my ear
Someone said to me
Wallflower, my dear
How come you can't see
They couldn't care less?
They're not impressed
As you might have guessed
You're in excess

Imagine my frustration with no
Invitation to dance

I smiled to the crowd
Tip toe and alert
Yes, the band blues went loud
But next on a flirt

A voice said to me

Then what will you do
Maybe you'll sit and sigh
Wishing that I were near, then
Maybe you'll ask me to come back again
And maybe I'll say maybe",Maybe

You heavenly thing
You look so wonderful
You're like a breath of spring
You leave me speechless

My man's gone away
He left his mama cold
For another gal, I'm told
I've tried to treat him kind
I thought he would be mine
That man I hate to lose
That's why mama's got the blues

The man that I love he has left me in this town
The man I love has gone and left me in this town
And if it keeps on snowin' I will be Gulf Coast bound
Mailman passed but he didn't leave no news
The mailman's passed but he didn't leave no news

Cares pursue ya, Hallelujah!

But Hallelujah, Hallelujah!
Helps to shoo the clouds away

I recall in times when I was small
In light and free Jubilee days
In that sunny land of milk and honey
I had no complaints while I thought of saints
So I say to all who fearful are

Sing Hallelujah, Hallelujah!
And you'll shoo the blues away
When cares pursue ya, Hallelujah!
Gets you through the darkest day

Satan lies a-waitin'
And creatin' skies of gray
But Hallelujah, Hallelujah!
Helps to shoo the clouds away

Up at dawn and hit the deck
Put out your chest and straighten your neck
Gotta be clean without a speck
Tonight the admiral's comin' to check

Here this! Here that!
Shine your shoes and square your hat
They'll give 'ya the boot if 'ya don't salute
Hup one two!

But moonbeams being gold are something I can't behold

When you left the curtain fell
I'd like to laugh but nothing strikes me funny

Oh, heaven is in your eyes
While the wind is sobbing
Underneath the stars
Both our hearts are throbbing
Like two guitars

Love here in the starlit hour
Night whispering lullabies
Let me dream forever
Underneath the silvery skies

Will it be just as sweet again
The glamor, the glory that we know?
Will I find when we meet again
The glamor, the glories still aglow?

But tonight let us forget tomorrow
Here under the midnight blue
Love will bloom and flower
In the starlit hour with you",Starlight Hour

In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear that I adore you, dear
But grant me, just the same
I'm not entirely to blame

For you'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above

So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for
We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together

That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
'Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love

So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see

Ella Fitzgerald,"Whenever skies look grey to me
And trouble begins to brew
Whenever the winter winds
Become too strong
I concentrate on you

When fortune cries nay, nay to me
And people declare ""you're through""
Whenever the blues become my only song
I concentrate on you

On your smile, so sweet, so tender
When at first, your kiss I decline
On the love in your eyes when I surrender
And once again, our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dreams never come true
To prove that even wise men can be wrong
I concentrate on you",I Concentrate on You

And father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry

How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm

My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Gosh, your lips are delicious
Well, maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before

I've got to get home
But, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me a comb
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died

It's your tongue that's at fault, not your noodle

You better listen and try to be good
And try to do all the things that you should
The Dipsy Doodle will get you some day
You'll think you're crazy, the things that you'll say
Like ""Rhythm got I and hot am I""
That's the way the Dipsy Doodle works

If it gets you, you'll be singin' it
And we'll bet you, you'll be swingin' it

The Dipsy Doodle's the thing to beware
The Dipsy Doodle will get in your hair
And if it gets you, it couldn't be worse
Everything you say will come out in reverse
""You love I and me love you""
That is just the way the Dipsy Doodle works

Whenever you think you're crazy
You're the victim of the Dipsy Doodle
But it's not your mind that's hazy
It's your tongue that's at fault, not your noodle

You better listen and try to be good
And try to do all the things that you should
The Dipsy Doodle will get you some day
And you'll think you're crazy, the things you'll say
""Violets are red, roses are blue""
Roses, roses, roses, all around you

You'll never know it until too late
And then you're in such a terrible state
If you wanna do the Doodle, do the Dipsy Doodle
Doo, doo, doo, do the Dipsy Doodle
Doo, doo, doo, do the Dipsy Doodle
Doo, doo, doo, do the Dipsy Doodle
Do the Dipsy Doodle now",The Dipsy Doodle
Ella Fitzgerald,"If you only knew how in love with you
I have always been hopin' you'd give in
If you only knew

One would never guess what I must confess
But it's really so, though you may not know
You're my happiness

Fate has started a story so blind
You can make it the perfect rhyme

If you only knew what your love could do
You would say, ""Okay, darling, lead the way""

Ella Fitzgerald,"I'm thru with love,
I'll never fall again.
Said I do to love,
Don't ever call again.
For I must have you
Or no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

I've locked my heart.
I keep my feelings there.
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire.
For I need to care for no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

Why did you leave me
To think that you cared.
You didn't need me.
You have your share
of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
Their deep devotion.

Did you good by the spring 
And all it meant to me

For I must have you or no one.

That's why I'm thru with love.",I'm Thru With Love
Ella Fitzgerald,"I've grown accustomed to his face
He almost makes the day begin
I've grown accustomed
To the tune that he whistles night and noon

His smiles, his frowns
His ups, his downs
Are second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in

I was serenely independent
And content before we met
Surely I could always be that way again
And yet I've grown accustomed to his look

Accustomed to his voice
Accustomed to his face
I'm so used to hearing him say
""Good morning"" every day

His joys, his woes
His highs, his lows
Are second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in

I'm very grateful he's a man and so easy to forget
Rather like a habit one can always break
And yet I've grown accustomed
To the trace of something in the air

Accustomed to his face",I've Grown Accustomed to His Face

Frankie, dear, your birthday gift reveals to me
That at heart you`re really not so bad.
If I add, why our funny face appeals to me.
Please dont` think I`ve suddenly gone mad.
You have all the qualities of Peter Pan;
I`d go far before I`d find a sweeter pan
And yet

[Chorus]
I love your funny face,
Your sunny, funny face;
For you`re a cutie
With more than beauty

In having you around.
Through you`re not Gloria Swanson,
For worlds I`d not replace

Needn`t tell me that I`m not so pretty, dear,
When my looking glass and I agree,
In the contest at Atlantic City, dear,

Truth to tell, though, you`re not such a bad lot yourself;
As a Paul Swan, you are not so hot yourself.

That sunny, funny face;
Thought it upsets one,
In time, it gets one -

Those eyes! Those nose! Those cheek!
Won`t make a movie sheik,

But though your`e not patootie,
For worlds I`d not replace

The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

Just meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Who would, would you
And so, all else above

What am I gonna do if you turn me down
When I`m so crazy over you?

I`d be so lonely
Where am I gonna go if you turn me down
Why blacken all my skies of blue?

I tell you, I`m not asking any miracle
It can be done, it can be done
I know a clergyman who will grow lyrical
And make us one, and make us one

Still we're often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet
He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret

I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb

There's a somebody I'm longin' to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could, always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man
Some girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

She means her tender songs for somebody else
And even when I have my arms around her
I know her thoughts are strong for somebody else
The hands I held belong to somebody else

Ella Fitzgerald,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right

I'll come back on my knees some day?

Oh, what I'd give for that wonderful phrase
To hear those three little words
That's all I'd live for the rest of my days

Which simply mean I love you

He would spend it on the girls

Such a sweet, sweet guy was he

[Chorus]
And her tears flowed like wine
Yes, her tears flowed like wine
She's a real sad tomato
She's a busted valentine
Knows her mama done told her
That her man is darned unkind

How he loved the old race horses
He would bet them every day
One day he caught a winner
And the cabbage wasn't hay
He indulged in fancy spending
Ordered rings, cars, and furs
But alas, alack
Like a stab in the back
She found out they were not hers

He got mixed up with a Maisie
He got mixed up with a Flo
So Flo shoved him in the river
He'll not get mixed up no more

That showed her figure fine
Then she cussed him out, the two-faced guy
No insurance could she find

When I could be out where the lights are bright?
It's all because of Jim, It's all because of Jim.
Why am I wasting these precious years?
Why am I crying these bitter tears?
It's all because of Jim, It's all because of Jim.

Jim doesn't ever bring me pretty flowers,
Jim never tries to cheer my lonely hours,
Don't know why I'm so crazy for Jim.
Jim never tells me I'm his hearts desire.
I never seem to set his love afire
Gone are the years I've wasted on him.

Sometimes when I get feeling low,
I say ""Let's call it quits.""

His advances she frequently spurns
In her anger one day
She may send him away
Then she's anxious until he returns
Until he returns
She provokes him as much as she can
But she likes him to still persevere
Oh, it's very remiss
And the danger is this
She may do it too often, I fear
She may do it too often, I fear
Once too often
Time after time
Doubtless his heart will soften
But the day may arrive
When she finds out, alack
That her lover will leave her
And never come back
She's refused him just once too often

Then that maiden will sit there and sigh
For the lesson is bitter indeed
Now she's quite wide awake
She can see her mistake
And for pardon she's longing to plead
She's longing to plead
She has let all her chances pass by
And the moral may clearly be seen
For whoever you are
It is better by far
If you always will say what you mean
If you always will say what you mean
Once too often
Time after time
Doubtless his heart will soften
But the day may arrive
When she finds out, alack
That her lover will leave her
And never come back

O why should I have spring fever, when it isn't even spring

Ella Fitzgerald,"I'm the lonesomest gal in town
Everybody has thrown me down
I got no angel child to ever call me ""dear""
Got no honey man for me to cuddle near

But I'm learnin' to roll my eyes
And someday you may be surprised
When I steal someone's lovin' man
And kiss him with a smack

I'll hug him and I'll squeeze him
But I'll never give him back
'Cause I'm lonesome, so very lonesome
I'm the lonesomest gal in this here town

If you read in the papers some day
That some poor girl has passed away
Don't shed a tear if you should hear
That gal was me and if you see

My picture in the paper with a smile on my face
I was broken-hearted that smile was out of place
If you wanna save a gal from her grave
Find me a man if you can

I'm the lonesomest gal in town
Everybody is throwin' me down
I got no angel child to ever call me ""dear""
Got no honey man for me to cuddle near

Ella Fitzgerald,"My heart and I decided
If you like it, we'd like it too
Secluded with you

My heart and I decided
We'd find heaven, blue heaven too
Secluded with you

Up on the Prairie or out on a desert
Where tumbleweeds stumble around
High on a mountain or deep in a valley
Or some little alley in town

My heart and I decided
It's just too, too good to be true
Secluded with you

My heart and I decided
We'd find heaven, blue heaven too
Secluded with you

Up on the Prairie or out on a desert

It's just too, too good to be true
When I'm secluded with you

Ella Fitzgerald,"Blow ill wind, blow away, find my love today
You're blowin' me no good, no good
Go ill wind, go away, skies are oh, so gray
Around my neighborhood and that's no good

You're only misleadin' the sunshine I'm needin'
Ain't that a shame

From out of nowhere, when loves to blame

Ella Fitzgerald,"I thought I'd found the man of my dreams
Now it seems, this is how the story ends
He's going to turn me down and say
Can't we be friends

I thought for once it couldn't go wrong
Not for long, I can see the way this ends
He's going to turn me down and say
Can't we be friends

Never again, through with love
Through with men
They play their game without shame
And who's to blame

I thought I'd found a man I could trust
What a bust, this is how the story ends
He's going to turn me down and say
Can't we be friends

Yes, I thought I knew the wheat from the chaff
What a laugh, this is how our story ends
I'll let her turn me down and say
Can't we be friends

I acted like a kid out of school
What a fool, now I see this is the end
I'll let her turn me down and say
Can't we be friends

Oh what should I give
Though he gave me the air
Why should I cry
He was sigh and wonder why

Yes, I should have seen the signal to stop
What a flop, this is how the story ends
She's gonna turn me down and say
Can't we be friends

What should I give
Though he gave me the air
And why should I cry
He was sigh and wonder why

I should have seen the signal to stop

Ella Fitzgerald,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low and had me down
I viewed the morning, with alarm
The British museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
Yes, for suddenly, I saw you there
And through the foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere

It's a lovely day
And everything's O.K.

You were going on your way
Now you've got to remain

Yes, just as you were going
Leaving me all at sea

We kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamour
Your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night

I never planned in my imagination
A situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer
My arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night

Ella Fitzgerald,"The evening breeze
Caressed the trees, tenderly
The trembling trees
Embraced the breeze, tenderly

Then you and I
Came wandering by
And lost in a sigh
Were we

The shore was kissed
By sea and mist, tenderly
I can't forget
How two hearts met
Breathlessly

Your arms opened wide
And closed me inside
You took my lips
You took my love
So tenderly

The evening breeze
Erased the trees, tenderly
The trembling trees
Embraced the breeze, tenderly

Then you and I
Came wandering by
And lost in a sigh
Were we

The shore was kissed
By the mist, tenderly
I can't forget
How two hearts met
Tenderly

Your arms opened wide
And closed me inside
You took my chops
Way from bops

Ella Fitzgerald,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things

Going out of my head over you
Out of my head over you
Out of my head
Day and night, Night and day
It's wrong, Wrong or right

I must think of a way into your heart
Ah, there's no other reason that we should be apart

Yes I think I'm going out of my head
I can't explain the tears that I've shed
Over you, over you
I see you each morning but you just walk past me
You don't even know that I exist

Going out of my head over you
Out of my head over you
Out of my head day and night
Night and day it's wrong
Wrong or right
Going out of my head 
Day and night, night and day
It's wrong, wrong or right
Going out of my head
Going out of my head.

Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and then it eased my pain
Now the dark days are gone and bright days are here
My Sunny once shined so sincere, Sunny once so true

Never go away
Sad, mad blues

Had no cause to complain
Life was as sweet as apple pie
Never noticed the rain
Till you came by.

Can't sleep nights and suffer all the day

Tingling all through, I feel somehow
I was doing all right

Ella Fitzgerald,"Thanks for the memory
Of things I can't forget, journeys on a jet
Our wondrous week in Martinique and Vegas and roulette
How lucky I was

And thanks for the memory
Of summers by the sea, dawn in Waikiki
We had a pad in London, but we didn't stop for tea
How cozy it was

Now since our breakup, I wake up
Alone on a gray morning-after
I long for the sound of your laughter
And then I see the laugh's on me

But thanks for the memory
Of every touch and thrill; I've been through the mill
I've lived a lot and learned a lot; you loved me not and still
I miss you so much

Thanks for the memory
Of how we used to jog even in a fog
That barbecue in Malibu away from all the smog
How rainy it was

Thanks for the memory
Of letters I destroyed, books that we enjoyed
Tonight, the way things look, I need a book by Sigmund Freud
How brainy he was

Gone are those evenings on Broadway
Together we'd go to a great show
But now I begin with the Late Show
And wish that you were watching too

I know it's a fallacy
That grown men never cry; baby, that's a lie
We had our bed of roses, but forgot that roses die
And thank you so much",Thanks for the Memory
Ella Fitzgerald,"Sleep, my little Jesus
On Thy bed of hay
While the shepherds homeward
Journey on their way

Softly sleep, sweetly sleep

Is what I'm guilty of
Go on and sentence me

To see what I can see
I hope you'll understand
This time's just for me

Because it's my turn

To those I've tried to please

But now it's my turn

And I'll let you go
Though I know it won't be easy

With no more room for lies
For years I've seen my life
Through someone else's eyes

And now it's my turn
To try and find my way
And if I should get lost
At least I'll own today

It's my turn
Yes, it's my turn
And there ain't no use in holding on
When nothing stays the same

So I'll let it rain
'Cause the rain ain't gonna hurt me

To turn and say goodbye
I sure would like to know
That you're still on my side

Because it's my turn

To start from number one
Trying to undo
Some damage that's been done

To reach and touch the sky

At least I didn't try

Tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confessin' that I need you,
Honest I do, need you every moment.
In your eyes I read such strange things,
But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

Saying ""can't we still be friends""

Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret
You were completely forgotten
Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is still a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say, I love you
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs, never out of date
Heart's full of passion, jealousy and hate
Woman needs man, and man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers

I can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it,
There's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to
minor,

Then take me far on a drifting star
To some romantic shore

Find me the one, that wonderful one
Who'll whisper, ""I am yours forever""

Fill the night with music dipped in perfume
Like ""April in Paris"" or maybe ""Love in Bloom""
For somehow I feel I'll find my ideal
Tonight in my vagabond dreams",Vagabond Dreams
Ella Fitzgerald,"Can anyone explain the thrill of a kiss
No! No! No!
But when two eager lips are pressed against yours
You'll know, yes, you'll know

Can anyone explain the glow of romance
No! No! No!
But when you hear the phrase ""It's you I adore""
You'll know, yes, you'll know

And you will find, to give love a start
Don't think with your mind, just feel with your heart

Can anyone explain the wonder of love 
No! No! No!
But now that you and I are sharing a sigh
We know, yes, we know

And you will find, to give love a start
Don't think with your mind, just feel with your heart

Can anyone explain the wonder of love 
No! No! No!
But now that you and I are sharing a sigh
We know, yes, we know",Can Anyone Explain? [Single Version]
Ella Fitzgerald,"Thank you, you're very kind
Won't you come home, Bill Bailey?
Won't you come home?
Ah, you've been away too long
I do that cooking, honey
You just bring home the money
Bill Bailey, please, come on home
Each night, when we sing this
We're making an attempt to swing this
We sing this song a different way
That's why I say
Who knows, like Mack the Knife
You may play this song all your life
So, Bill Bailey, won't you come on home?

As Miss Sophie Tucker might say
Won't you come home, Bill Bailey?
I say, won't you come home?
Oh, you've been away
Oh honey, you've been away too long
I'll do that cooking, honey, yes
You just bring home the money
Some of these days, Bill
You're gonna come on home

As Miss Della Reese might say
Won't you come home, Bill Bailey?
I say, won't you come home?
I say, you've been away too long

And as Miss Pearl Bailey might say
Bill, honey, daddy, you'd better bring it on home
'Cause, honey, I'm just so tired of waiting on you
Honey, these shoes--I, I'm telling you, baby, it can't wait no longer

Yes, I said
Won't you come, won't you come?
Won't you come on home, Bill Bailey?
I say, you've been away too long
Since you've been gone, there's no stopping
To this thing they call bee-bopping
So, Bailey, please, come on home

Now, everybody, twist it
I say, everybody, twist it
So, Bailey, please, come home, no more to roam

I've sung the lyrics to this song so long
I guess it's time to say so long
So, Bailey, won't you come on home?
Mama needs loving
Bill, Bailey, won't you come?
Come home","Bill Bailey, Won't You Come Home?"
Ella Fitzgerald,"Words are flowing out like
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Jai Guru Deva, om.

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Ella Fitzgerald,"You say you love me
You swear that you do
But how can you love me
And be so untrue?
Oh, oh, what do you know about love?

You say you mean it
How happy we'll be
But how can you mean it
And be mean to me?
Oh, oh, what do you know about love?

It's funny
When you hold me tight
It thrills me so much it's a sin
But, honey
When you hold me tight
This isn't love; it's the mood that you're in

I'd like to believe you
That we'll never part
How can I believe you
When you break my heart?
Oh, oh, what do you know about love?

It's funny

Ella Fitzgerald,"Because of rain, I fell in love with you
The raindrops seem to want to help me too
Because of rain, we stayed indoors and watched it pour
That's how I found the one that I adore

Because of rain, we stole a kiss or two
The cloudy day gave way to skies of blue
We must thank the misty, moisty windowpane
We found our love because of rain

Because of rain, we stole a kiss or two
The cloudy day gave way to skies of blue
We must thank the misty, moisty windowpane
We found our love because of rain",Because of Rain
Ella Fitzgerald,"Love was the thing that you wanted
That's why we answered loves call
Now that you've got what you wanted
You don't seem to want it at all

Careless
Now that you've got me loving you
You're careless
Careless in everything you do

You break up appointments and think you are smart
If you're not careful you'll break my heart

Careless
Now that my bridges all are burned
You're careless
Careless in things where I'm concerned
Are you just careless, as you seem to be
Or do you just care less for me?",Careless
Ella Fitzgerald,"I'm on the beam; I've got a flash
On how to live in the civilization
To make a dream come out of hash
Give a little, get a little love

A morning smile, an evening kiss
Can be the pills for the ills of the nation
Don't cramp your style; remember this
Give a little, get a little love

No love, no hope
Then life's a dungeon
So throw the sponge in
With love there's hope
Sing, hey, hallelujah

So take a share and share the fun
And keep the cold from this whole constellation
It's everywhere for everyone
Make a little, take a little
Take a little, live a little
Give a little, get a little love

You carry on, tied in a knot
To earn the pay that your neighbor is earning
But when it's gone, what have you got?
Give a little, get a little love

You never think till there's a storm
And till the real things you feel like returning
You know that mink won't keep you warm
Give a little, get a little love

No love, no joy
Then life's a nuisance and not worth two cents
With love, there's joy
Sing hey hallelujah

So take a share and share the fun
And keep the cold from this whole constellation
It's everywhere for everyone
Make a little, take a little
Take a little, live a little
Give a little, get a little love

No joy, no joy
Give a little, get a little
Give a little, get a little

Make a little, take a little 
Live a little, give a little 
Give a little, get a little love","Give a Little, Get a Little"
Ella Fitzgerald,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance with You
Ella Fitzgerald,"Melancholy me
Melancholy over you
All alone and feelin' blue
Are you melancholy too?

Miss you every day
Ever since you went away
Melancholy over you
Are you melancholy too?

While each minute seems
Like hours to me
Each hour seems like years
Each day is an eternity
Of sadness and tears

All I do is yearn
Though I know you'll soon return
But until you do, I'll be
Just a melancholy me

Ella Fitzgerald,"Hmm, c'est si bon 
Lovers say that in France 
When they thrill to romance 
It means that it's so good 

Oh, c'est si bon
So I say it to you 
Like the French people do 
Because it's oh-so good, ba-ba-doo, doo day

Every word, every sigh
Every kiss, dear 
Leads to only one thought 
And it's this, dear!
 
Hmm, it's so good

I wanna be with you tonight

If I could be with you, I'd love you strong
If I could be with you, I'd love you long
I want you to know that I wouldn't go
Until I told you, honey, why I love you so

If I could be with you, one hour tonight
If I was free to do the things I might, things I might

Ella Fitzgerald,"Give me a kiss to build a dream on
And my imagination will thrive upon that kiss
Sweetheart, I ask no more than this
A kiss to build a dream on

Give me a kiss before you leave me
And my imagination will feed my hungry heart
Leave me one thing before we part

And when I'm alone with my fancies, I'll be with you
Weaving romances, making believe they're true

Oh, give me your lips for just a moment
And my imagination will make that moment live
Give me what you alone can give
A kiss to build a dream on

When I'm alone with my fancies, I'll be with you

In the land of the dreamy scenes
There's a Garden of Eden

Might never be cross or try to be boss,

For nobody else gave me a thrill.

Might never be cross or try to be boss,

For me to hear.

In front of you.

I needed someone just like you.
I needed you, to stay.

So I'll stand by.
And watch you slide.
But I can't hide,
The pain inside.
So I lay down.

Then you leave.
When I needed someone to stay.
You were my friend.

And I wanted you to stay.

It means you're the fairest in the land

Bei mir bist do schon, you've heard it all before
 but let me try to explain
Bei mir bist do schon means that you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, it's such an old refrain
 and yet I should explain
It means I am begging for your hand

There's a ball of fire that's burning

Ella Fitzgerald,"Everyone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

The emblem of suffering and shame;
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see,
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.",The Old Rugged Cross

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little moon starts to climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wandered down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by

Sometimes I wonder why I spend
A lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
Now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
Of paradise where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

Ella Fitzgerald,"We're sitting out here on the runway
Waiting for the plane to leave
And the captain says, ""There'll be a short delay
Bear with me, please""

They gave us the usual hassle
""You can't take those guitars on board""
But the boys in the band just smiled
Heard it all before

And as they're starting to serve champagne
To the folks at the front of the plane
I can hear the engines roaring
We're on our way

And we are flying home
I feel the freedom in my soul
Flying home at last
Flying home
I've got the freedom in my soul

And it's four in the morning
My world is calling
Speeding through the universe tonight

The movie reminds of my lady
As she waits, ""Where are those guys?""
Yes, it's nice to see old Butch and Sundance in the sky

And now the sun is beginning to rise
It's like looking down on Paradise
There's a ball of fire that's burning
Giving life

And we are flying home
I feel the freedom in my soul
Flying home at last

Ella Fitzgerald,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's Heaven
How high the moon

There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
It's where you are
Somewhere there's Heaven
How near, how far

The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will how still my heart
How high the moon

""How high the moon""
Is the name of the song
How high the moon

Though the words may be wrong
We're singing it because you ask for it
So we're singing it just for you

How high the moon
Does it touch the stars?
How high the moon
Does it reach out to Mars?

Though the words may be wrong to the song
We're asking a high, high, high, high
High is the moon

Though the words may be wrong to the song
We're ought to make high, high, high, high

It's terribly sad but true,
All dressed up, no place to go

Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""
Birds singing in the sycamore trees
Dream a little dream of me

Say nighty-night and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be

Ella Fitzgerald,"Once I was young
Yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul
And kissed some other chaps

Once I was young
But never was naive
I thought I had a trick or two
Up my imaginary sleeve

And now I know I was naive

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too

I didn't know what day it was
You held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say I'm all your own

I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes

I'm wise
And I know what time it is now

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say I'm all your own

It ended a moment ago

When we looked at each other

That was the end of a beautiful friendship
And just the beginning of love

Felt this way the first time you came in sight
Suddenly my gloomy old sky turned magically bright

You'll find I'm perfect casting opposite you
You'll find love everlasting
You're the why and wherefore
I was born to care for

All I live for now is to hold you tight

With a very crooked nose
He lived inside a log hut
And they called him Ol' Man Mose
One dark and dreary morning I knocked upon his door
I didn't hear a single sound
So I ain't gonna do it no more

'Cause I believe Ol' Man, I believe Ol' Man
I believe Ol' Man, that Ol' Man Mose is dead

And I peeped in through the crack
Inside there was an old man
Laying flat upon his back
I thought that he was sleeping
Head hung to the floor
He didn't make a single move
So I ain't gonna do it no more

Gone, gone, gone with the wind
Just like a leaf that has flown away
Gone with the wind
My romance has flown away
Yesterday's kisses are still, still on my lips
I've had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips

But now all-all is gone
Gone is the rapture that fills my heart
Gone with the wind
My romance has flown apart

Love burned brightly, then became

You're the one who made my dreams come true
A few kisses ago

I remember you-ooh
You're the one who said ""I love you, too""
Yes, I do, didn't ya know?

I remember, too, a distant bell and stars that fell
Like the rain out of the blue

When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of it all
Then I will tell them I remember you-ooh

Ella Fitzgerald,"Come along and listen to the lullaby of Broadway,
The hip-hooray and ballyhoo, the lullaby of Broadway.
The rumble of a subway train, the rattle of the taxis,
The daffodils who entertain at Angelo's and Maxie's.

When a Broadway Baby says goodnight, it's early in the morning,
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight until the dawn,
Goodnight, baby, goodnight, milkman's on his way.
Sleep tight, baby, sleep tight, let's call it a day.
Listen to the lullaby of Broadway.",Lullaby of Broadway
Ella Fitzgerald,"Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee

A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous; he answers twice
It's really killin'
That he's so willin' to make whoopee

Picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring

He's washin' dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious he even sews
But don't forget, folks
That's what you get, folks, for makin' whoopee

Another year or maybe less
What's this I hear? Well, you can't confess
She feels neglected, and he's suspected
Of makin' whoopee

She sits alone 'most every night
He doesn't phone her; he doesn't write
He says he's busy, but she says, ""Is he?""
He's makin' whoopee

He doesn't make much money
Only five thousand per
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, ""You'll pay six to her""

He says, ""Now, Judge, suppose I fail?""
The judge says, ""Budge right into jail""
You'd better keep her; I think it's cheaper
Than makin' whoopee

Ella Fitzgerald,"My old flame, I can't even think of his name, but it's funny now and then
How my thoughts go flashing back again to my old flame
My old flame, my new lovers all seem so tame, for I haven't met a gent
So magnificent or elegant as my old flame

I've met so many who had fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes, some who took me up to the skies
But their attempts at love were only imitations of my old flame
I can't even think of his name, but I'll never be the same
Until I discover what became of my old flame

Ella Fitzgerald,"You're clear out of this world
When I'm looking at you
I hear out of this world
The music that no mortal ever knew

You're right out of a book
The fairy tale I read when I was five
No armored knight out of a book
Was more enchanted by a loralei
Then I

After waiting so long
For the right time
After reaching so long for a star
All at once from long and lonely night time
And despite time, here you are

If you said we were through
So let me fly out of this world
And spend the next eternity or two
With you",Out of This World

Skies above me
Never were as blue as his eyes

There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me

It changes with the hours
When he's near I'm fair and warmer
When he's gone I'm cloudy with showers

An emotion like the ocean
It's either sink or swim
When a woman loves a man
Like I love him

Never treats me sweet and gentle, the way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good
My poor heart is sentimental, not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good

But when the weekend's over and Monday rolls around
I end up like I started out just cryin' my lil' heart out
He don't love me like I love him
No, nobody could, I got it bad and that ain't good

So bad, so bad

I got on it so bad, so bad though folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
I'm glad, I'm mad about you, I can't live without you

Ella Fitzgerald,"I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light
I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low

I'm beginning to see the light
Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now
I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light",I'm Beginning to See the Light (With the Ink Spots)

The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
I am happy with the Lord

Just a plain and simple chapel
Where all good people go to pray
I prayed the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day

I searched and I searched but I couldn't find
No way on earth to find peace of mind

Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord

That old black magic that you weave so well
Icy fingers up
And down my spine
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine

The same old tingle that i feel
Inside
When that elevator starts its ride
Down and down i go, round and round i go
Like a leaf that's
Caught in the tide

I should stay away but what can i do
I hear your name, and i'm aflame
Aflame with
Such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

You are the lover that i've waited for
The mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine

Baby down and down i go,
All around i go
In a spin, loving the spin that i'm in
Under that old black magic called love",That Old Black Magic [Multimedia Track]

What can I say dear after I say I'm sorry,
What can I do to prove it to you that I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to ever be mean to you-oo
If I didn't care I wouldn't feel like I do,
I was all wrong,
But right or wrong I don't blame you
Why should I take somebody like you and shame you
I know that I made you cry and I'm so sorry dear
So what can I say dear after I say I'm sorry,

Tell me Baby what can I say dear after I say I'm sorry so-so sorry
What can I do to prove it to you I'm sorry

Out of town were the people I knew

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning with much alarm

Could this thing last

And through foggy London town

Yeah, Miller, he was spending that trash

Ella Fitzgerald,"The evening breeze caressed the trees, tenderly
The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by

And closed me inside
You took my lips you took my love so tenderly",Tenderly [DVD]

Don't be sad, I must add, that they meant no more than chess-men

Darling, can't you see?
'Twas for charity?
Though these lips have made slips, it was never really serious
Who'd have thought, I'd be brought to a state that's so delirious?

I could cry salty tears
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now
How long has this been goin' on?

There were chills up my spine
And some thrills I can't define
Listen sweet, I repeat
How long has this been goin' on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt
Into heaven I'm hurled
I know how columbus felt
Finding another world

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee 
That time won't erase his name

The fact is, the only work 
That really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love, you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it

Holding hands at midnight
'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more

Ella Fitzgerald,"That old black magic has me in it's spell
That old black magic that you weave so well
Icy fingers up
And down my spine
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine

The same old tingle that I feel
Inside
When that elevator starts it's ride
Down and down I go, round and round I go
Like a leaf that's
Caught in the tide

I should stay away but what can I do
I hear your name, and I'm aflame
Aflame with
Such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

You are the lover that I've waited for

The mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine

Baby down and down I go,
All around I go
In a spin, loving the spin that I'm in
Under that old black magic called love

I hear those trumpets blow again
All aglow again

Here I slide again
About to take that ride again
Starry eyed again
Taking a chance on love
I thought that cards were a frame-up
I never would try
But Now I'm taking the game up
And the ace of hearts is high
Things are mending now
I see a rainbow blending now
We'll have a happy ending now

About to take that tip again
Got my grip again

In clover I lie
And brother rabbit of course you
Better kiss your foot good-bye

I'm gonna give my all again

Do nothing till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others youve heard
I havent a chance

True, Ive been seen with someone new
But does that mean that Im untrue? 
While were apart, the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you

And other arms may hold a thrill

And you never will!",Do Nothing Till You Hear from Me

I wonder why a little

Why the Gods above me
Who must be in the know
Think so little of me

When you're near
There's such an air of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere

Ella Fitzgerald,"Don't stamp your foot at me,
It's impolite
To stamp your foot at me
Is not quite right.
At man's ingratitude
A woman winks,
But such an attitude just stinks.

I have eyes for you to give you dirty looks.
I have words that do not come from children's books
there's a trick with a knife I'm learning to do
And everything I've got belongs to you.
I've a powerful anesthesia in my fist,
And the perfect wrist to give your neck a twist.
There are hammerlock holds,
I've mastered a few,
And everything I've got belongs to you.
Share for share, share alike,
You get struck each time I strike.
You for me, me for me
I'll give you plenty of nothing.
I'm not yours for better but for worse,
And I've learned to give the well-known witches' curse.
I've a terrible tongue, a temper for two,
And everything I've got belongs to you.

Don't raise your voice at me,
That's very rude.
To raise your voice at me
Is rather crude.
It's wrong essentially when woman yells,
And confidentially, it smells.

I'll converse with you on politics at length,
I'll protect you with my superhuman strength.
If you're ever attacked I'll scream and say , ""Boo!""
And everything I've got belongs to you.
I will never stray from home, I'll just stay put,
'Cause I've got a brand-new thing called athlete' s foot.
I'm a victim of colds, anemia, too,
And everything I've got belongs to you.
Off to bed we will creep,
Then we'll sleep and sleep and sleep
'Til the birds start to peep.

I've got you, deep in the heart of me 
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me

I said to myself this affair, it never will go so well 
But why should I try to resist, when baby I know damn well 
That I've got you, under my skin 

I'd sacrifice anything come what might 
For the sake of having you near 
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night 
And repeats, repeats in my ear

But each time I do just the thought of you makes me stop before I begin

There's a small hotel
With a wishing well
I wish that we were there together
There's a (no) bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to share together
Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who wants people?
When the steeple bell says
""Good night, sleep well""
We'll thank the small hotel together

Pretty window curtains made of chance
In a make-believe land
On the wall are several cheerful prints
Of Grant and Grover Cleveland
Look out into the parlor and feast your eyes
On the moose head on the wall
Perhaps you'd like to play the organ
They tune it every other fall
When the steeple bell says
""Good night, sleep well""

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",Theres a Small Hotel

Lingering on a pillow
Wild strawberries

And the scent of roses

As the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

How sweet
To find you still
These things are dear to me

Who walk like dreamers

Whether near to me or far

In the silence of my lonely room

Ella Fitzgerald,"I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill when I found you
The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill
And lingered until my dreams came true

The wind in the willow played love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made were never to be
Though we're apart you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill

(I found my thrill)
Come climb the hill with me, baby
(On Blueberry Hill)
We'll see what we shall see

(On Blueberry Hill)
I'll bring my horn with me
(When I found you)
I'll be with you where berries are blue

(The moon stood still)
Each afternoon we'll go
(On Blueberry Hill)
Higher than the moon we'll go
(And lingered until)
Then, to a weddin' in June we'll go
(My dreams came true)

The wind in the willow played
(Do you really love me)
Love's sweet melody
(As I love you?)

But all of those vows we made
(Will you still remember)
Were never to be
(When the night is through?)

Though we're apart you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill",Blueberry Hill
Ella Fitzgerald,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

I had a rendezvous with somebody new

You've got a reason to be mad I suppose
But he only was a passing fad
Baby, don'cha be mad

His kind's a dime a dozen
And that's not the kind I want (I should have past him by)

Would wander in to that restaurant? (would come along and give us the eye?)

Don't you know it, babe?
Why couldn't you be contented
With the love I gave?
I've given you my heart
But now you want my mind
Your love scares me to death, girl
It's the chokin' kind
You can kill a man
With bullets, poison, or a knife
But it hurts him more
To take his pride and run his life
Whatever it is you want, girl
Lord, I hope you find
But that hat don't fit my head
It's the chokin' kind

When you fall in love again, girl
Take a tip from me
If you don't like the peaches
Walk on by the tree
Find what you want and keep it
Treat it sweet and kind

Ella Fitzgerald,"One little kiss, a moment of bliss, then hours of deep regret
One little smile, and after a while, a longing to forget
One little heartache left as a token
One little plaything carelessly broken

Remember the night
The night you said, ""I love you""
Remember?

Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you
Remember?

Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot

You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot
To remember

You loved me too; my dreams had come true, and all the world was May
But soon the May-time turned to December
You had forgotten; do you remember?",(You Forgot) To Remember
Ella Fitzgerald,"The weather is frightening
The thunder and lightning
Seem to be having their way

Will keep us together

That as far as I'm concerned
It's a lovely day
And everything's okay

Isn't this a lovely day
To be caught in the rain?
You were going on your way
Now you've got to remain

Just as you were going
Leaving me all at sea
The clouds broke
They broke and, oh
What a break for me

I can see the sun up high
Though we're caught in the storm
I can see where you and I

Because I`m invited to step out this evening
With top hat, white tie and tails

I`m puttin` on my top hat

Brushin` off my tails

I`m dudein` up my shirt front

Dancin` in my tails","Top Hat, White Tie, and Tails"
Ella Fitzgerald,"After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no bromo-seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get, off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank god, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last,
Are cutting you down to your size at last

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more

Couldn't eat, was dispeptic

Those ants that invaded my pants, finis.

Ella Fitzgerald,"You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly you're sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap

Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap

You're hand-in-hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart until your heart just goes wap

Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap

Some starry night when her kisses make you tingle
Shell hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map

You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap

Some starry night when her kisses make you tingle
Shell hold you tight, and youll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot thats just a dot on the map

And then you wonder how it all came about
Its too late now; there's no gettin' out
You fell in love, and love is the tender trap",The Tender Trap

While there out making more; what for?

The weather there is nice and warm

Who's colder than an arctic storm
Got a heart just like a stone
Even ice men leave her alone

They call her Hard-Hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah, the meanest gal in town
Leather is tough, but Hannah's heart is tougher
She's a gal who loves to see men suffer

To tease them and thrill them, to torture and kill them
Is her delight, they say; I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan
There was Hannah, pouring water on a drowning man
She's Hard-Hearted Hannah, the Vamp of Savannah, GA

They call her Hard-Hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah, the meanest gal in town
Talk of your cold, refrigerating mamas
Brother, she's the polar bear's pajamas

To tease them and thrill them, to torture and kill them
Is her delight; they say an evening spent with Hannah sitting on your knees
Is like traveling through Alaska in your B-V-D's
She's Hard-Hearted Hannah, the Vamp of Savannah, GA

Can you imagine a woman as cold as Hannah?
She's got the right name, the Vamp of Savannah

In clover I lie

Better kiss your foot goodbye

I'm riding for a fall again
I'm gonna give my all again

Pitch the woo with my baby tonight
But brother, you fight my baby tonight

Every average man you know
Much prefers his lovey dovey to court
When the temperature is low
But when the thermometer goes way up
And the weather is sizzling hot

A marine for his queen
A G.I. for his cutie-pie is not

Too darn hot

It's too darn hot

Ella Fitzgerald,"Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee

A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous; he answers twice
It's really killin'
That he's so willin' to make whoopee

Picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring

He's washin' dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious he even sews
But don't forget, folks
That's what you get, folks, for makin' whoopee

Another year or maybe less
What's this I hear? Well, you can't confess
She feels neglected, and he's suspected
Of makin' whoopee

She sits alone 'most every night
He doesn't phone her; he doesn't write
He says he's busy, but she says, ""Is he?""
He's makin' whoopee

He doesn't make much money
Only five thousand per
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, ""You'll pay six to her""

He says, ""Now, Judge, suppose I fail?""
The judge says, ""Budge right into jail""
You'd better keep her; I think it's cheaper
Than makin' whoopee

You'd better keep her
I know it's cheaper

Ella Fitzgerald,"Bess, oh, where's my Bess?
Won't somebody tell me where?
I don't care what she says
I don't care what she's done
Won't somebody tell me where's my Bess?

Bess, no, Lord, my Bess, I want her now
Without her I can't go on
I counted the days that I was gone
Till I got home to see her face
Won't somebody tell me where's my Bess?

I want her so, my gal, where is she?
Oh Lord, in your big heaven
Show me where I must go
Oh, give me the strength, show me the way
Tell me the truth, where is she? Where is my gal?
Where is my Bess?

I long to try something I never had
Never had no kissing

I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me
But no one to love me
Lover man, oh, where can you be

I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems

Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears
Then whisper sweet
Little things in my ear

Night breezes seem to whisper, ""I love you""
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me

Say nighty-night and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams, whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me",Dream a Little Dream of Me [Version]

Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no bromo-seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get, off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank god, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last,
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more

Couldn't eat, was dispeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic
Since you moved out of there

Romance, finis. your chance, finis.
Those ants that invaded my pants, finis.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more",Bewitched (From 'Bewitched')

Ella Fitzgerald,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself: this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear:
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear:
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin [From ''Born to Dance'']

When i say to you

Do you love me
Just like i love you

Savoy, gives happy feet a chance to dance

You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will plenty implied

From now we can laugh at troubled waters

Ella Fitzgerald & Her Orchestra,"There's a saying old, says that love is blind
Still we're often told, ""seek and ye shall find""
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet
He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret

I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longin' to see
I hope that he, turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could, always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me

Soon, you'll find I live for you only.
When I'm with you who cares what time it is

Oh! Soon, our little ship will become sailing
Home through every storm, never failing,
The day you're mine this world will be in tune,
Let's make that day come soon.

The lovely present you bought
Why hadn't you brought me more,
But now if you'd come
I'd welcome anything
From the five and ten cent store,

You used to call me the top
You put me up on a throne
You let me fall with a drop

Can't believe the timing
Yesterday you're smiling
I guess we both played our parts
Very entertaining
But it's such a shame
That we lost our way
From the nights we danced

I say I'm over you
But I'm not sure that it's true

I am falling

I've been broken

Spent a long time running
From the mess we've made
And oh

Come on, heart let me in
Days can be so bright
And our way can be alight
And we both know
So don't pretend
Makes it all so hard

The way we were

I say I'm over you

Would it be enough to change your mind

You brought the hurricane into my life
Here's the truth, I want to know
How it feels on your own

How could you be kind but still so cruel?

Don't say that this is what it feels like
You've got my heart under a headlight
And though my mind is always changing
Won't you give my heart a break?
Try to fix the broken pieces once again
Don't say that this is what it feels like
To give your heart away

Nothing could feel the same between us two
You seemed to want me now I don't want you
I used to fall in the trash
Hard to find my way back
And now you hate it that I wear the shoes

But now you say you're so damn sorry
How could you pretend to be so real?

You've got my heart under a headlight

Won't you give my heart a break?

Just close your eyes
Hide away from the monster in disguise
None have learned to love
There ain't nothing I'm afraid of now

Well, I'll tell you so you'll understand
From whence old Ireland came

No wonder that I love
That dear old land across the sea
For here's the way my dear old Father
Told the tale to me

Sure, a little bit of heaven fell
From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow
'Tis the only place you'll find them
No matter where you go

Then they dotted it with silver
To make its lakes so grand
And when they had it finished
Sure, they called it Ireland!",A Little Bit of Heaven
Ella Logan,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel
Ella Mae Morse,"Day in, day out
The same old hoodoo follows me about
The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you
And, darling, I think of you
Day in and day out

Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake, I awaken with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips

The ocean's roar
A thousand drums

Ella Mae Morse,"Heart and soul, I fell in love with you
Heart and soul, the way a fool would do, madly
Because you held me tight
And stole a kiss in the night

Heart and soul, I begged to be adored
Lost control, and tumbled overboard, gladly
That magic night we kissed
There in the moon mist

Oh! but your lips were thrilling, much too thrilling
Never before were mine so strangely willing

But now I see, what one embrace can do
Look at me, it's got me loving you madly

Held all my heart and soul",Heart and Soul

I've settled revolutions in Spain

I've got a house, a showplace, but I get no place with you

Scheme just for a sight of you

In England I'm presented at court
But you've got me down-hearted 'cause I can't get started with you

With queens I've a la carted but can't get started with you

And toothpaste ads all feature my smiles

Pet, you devastated me.  
Yet, now you've deflated me- 'Til you're my Waterloo

And I find you spinning 'round in my brain

You go to my head like a sip of sparkling Burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought that you might give a thought to my plea
Cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be

You go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julys

There's a crazy little place that I know
Where the drinks are hotter than the chili sauce

In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico
He wears a purple sash, and a black moustache
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico

Well, the first time that I saw him
He was sittin' on a piano stool
I said ""Tell me dad, when does the fun begin?""
He just winked his eye and said ""Man, be cool.""

She started dancin' with the castanets

I didn't know just what to expect

She threw her arms around my neck

We started dancin' all around the floor

And how to kiss goodbye.

They do the boogie to an old square dance
The woods are full of couples lookin' for romance
Somebody takes his brogue and knocks out the light

The shoe you pass by in the store window
But soon as I got home I wish I bought you instead
I got it bad, I'll take the black, take the navy and red
No other man has ever, ever had quite this effect
I sleep alone cause there's no room in my bed
For any other lover, with no gun to my head
Your kisses hold me hostage
And I don't wanna stop it

'Cause I only wanna give it to you
And I want you more than a new pair of shoes
I only wanna give it to you
And I sure do hope that you feel like I do

I came before this digital ocean
Where folks only move in digital motion
But you're so classic I want you more than my Adidas
All the bees are getting at you cause your honey is sweeter
I need you, with no gun to my head
Your kisses hold me hostage and I don't want to stop it

'Cause I only wanna give it to you
And I want you more than a new pair of shoes

Here to stay for all of the seasons!
You're the weakness that I can't control!

Baby you all I need to get by
You fly, so you're all I need to get high
You got it? So put ya number in this camera phone
And we can live like the camera's on
No strip, though these boys claiming they ball
Got no grip, though
My flow switchmode, it's so schizo
So I'm the one that your girl blow a kiss for
You've got to love me, Cole World, no snuggy
Baddest girls hug me, my mind on you though
You're hoping I'm the one
But I already knew though
It ain't no secret that I get around, true
But girl, you make me want to settle down, with you
Get a crib with a view, lay up in the bed make a kid, maybe 2
All my ex-girlfriends gon' have to get a clue
'Cause the rumors that you heard about is true!

I said I only wanna give it to you
And I want you more than a new pair of shoes

And I sure do hope that you feel like I do

Slide past the walls of your heart like
You’re from the fly taking my time
Before revealing my
True intention
But you’re so impossible to suggest
When
You like us just the way we is
Please pardon me for my interjection

I long for you
It kills me to pretend
I’m not in love when I so am
But you don’t understand
That we’re such
Damn good friends
We could be a whole lot more
We could be a whole lot more
And we’re such damn good friends

Two puzzles
Identical with the same piece
Missing from both never complete
Never achieving their
True perfection
So why go scour the earth for the missed piece
Maybe the piece is in our kiss
Maybe the answers in my direction

I long for you
It kills me to pretend
I’m not in love when I so am

How do you make me smile
Simply by telling the time
You got those endless eyes, eye
I could just stay on day later and melt away

I'm done away with my pride

Oh my god he just looked at me
And I just wanna tell him something that he's never heard, oh
But my lips won't let me tell him, tell him
I would say this but

Maybe, maybe in another life
I could be the girl who walks up to the guy
And tells him, tells him how she feels inside
But, not tonight, no not tonight

What if he walks towards me
While all the blood is rushing right to my brain
What am I gonna say, what am I gonna say
I may stop breathing and freeze 'cause
That's the story of my life
Wouldn't it be crazy
If he felt, how I felt, overwhelmed and terrified
But he took my hand
And he took his chance, can I have this dance
If only we were in a Cinderella story

Maybe, maybe in another life
I could be the girl who walks up to the guy
And tells him, tells him how she feels inside
But, not tonight, no not tonight

Who would I be
To make my feelings known
I need a little audacity but it's not in my bones
I'm standing here, terrified
Brokenhearted, I could die, oh

I'm staring at him
But I forget to pick my face up off the floor
I feel like a fool
And even though I do
I only wanna tell him that I love him more, more

Oh what a night, oh what a night
Straight shots of Patron and a slice of lime
And I got myself too drunk to drive
Oh what a night
I left my car parked at the club
Woke up in the morning can't find my truck
I barely made it home alive
Oh what a night

My rommie says I bought the club a round on my tab
And I was so far gone she had to call me a cab
But I won't let nobody tell me nothing

I left my car parked at the club
Woke up in the morning can't find my truck
I barely made it home alive
Oh what a night

Well maybe I was trippin'
Just a little who am I?
Kidding, hanging with the boys too long
And I quit sipping
Look at me buying bottles
It's for my team
I don't do it for the models shit
I still remember hanging at the bar
Hoping I could get a drink or two
From a player or a star
And now I got my money in the ballas
I'll take your number but I'll probably never call you 'cause

How can I ever compete With 34 double D's?

And I'm rollin' my eyes
When I look down at my thighs
They might as well tape everything that I eat,
To my legs.
I am too broke for the knife
Too lazy to exercise
But if I had hazel eyes
Maybe I could be fly.

If I had no cellulite
Big breasts and pockets real wide
Then maybe I

I could be so fly.
And if I had a small waist
I'd make the boys go insane

Now listen
I've got a beautiful soul
But only 4 people know
They've known me since I was 10
Beauty did not matter then.

Now that I'm 20 all that matters
Is sex cars and money
I ain't got none of the three
So basically, I am invisible to all of the fellas
And I sit at home jealous
There was no golden ticket
In my chocolate today.

And worst of all
I'm reminded in the cruelest ways
Of how I don't look and I should look
And that's why I say

If I had no cellulite

Liposuction
And breast implants

Won't you marry me If I could be very handsome
Won't you marry me If I could be a tall guy
Don't you marry him if I could be in the next life

He has sold me a photocopy of your photograph

Ellegarden,"I should have peace of mind
But I get lost and retrace my steps
And time just passes

The memories keep piling up
And crash noisily to the ground
We'll turn today into a memory, too

I missed seeing the rainbow
Because I walked with my head down
So as not to break the thin ice

There were roads I didn't hesitate to take
It was scarier
To lose the freedom to go anywhere

The memories keep piling up
And crash noisily to the ground
We'll turn today into a memory, too
Even if mistakes and disagreements
Tear us apart
We'll turn today into a memory, too

I stopped in my tracks and look up at the sky
To see the first falling star of the year
And thought, maybe it's okay like this

I wanna job so don't forget to lend me some for train

But there's always someone faster

I'm trying to live a bit seriously
But what's on my mind is you know always girls

Pass me the potato chips

You know what It's like a magic thing

I got a red hot chili blows it away
I got the music playing loud in my head
Turn the blinker off we go straight ahead

It could be less or maybe the same as you
And I'm floating up more than a million times a day

But what's one my mind is always having fun
I know nicotine kills
But quitting smoking kills me now

As always no one understands
As always I'll do anything
As always if it makes you laugh

And about a half a mile to the downtown bar,
That I ran from in disgrace,

And disappear without a trace,
A year from now maybe settle down,
Where no one knows my face,

One more time to ease the pain,
But my times run out and I got to go,
Got to run away again,

You are the reason I have been
Waiting for so long

Ellen McIlwaine,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

And Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well, Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
And Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece of apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

And Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
And Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge

And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billie Joe

Fortunately baby, I'd already locked the door

They say, there are men who are blue like me in the stars
Beards for the weird and bars for bizarre guitar men
Fortunately baby, I'd already joined the force

Good time train, well, it does not need any track
It wins the race to the place where I'm gonna pack up
Fortunately baby, I'd already grabbed the sky

Judges shout you must slave to be a freeman
Fortunately baby, I am never coming back

Elli Fordyce,"Magic mirror come and search my heart
Can you tell me what you see
There's a thousand voices whispering
Songs and you're the melody

So I imagine my heart with you
See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive
Love ecstasy imagining you with me

Many, many days our shadows passed
Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light
And that morning light is you
So I imagine my heart with you

See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive 
love ecstasy imagining you, imagining me
The beauty we both can see

You're the dream I prayed would come along
To make my fantasy
Day and night you live inside my heart
You're the flame of love to me

Elli Fordyce,"All I want is a room somewhere
Far away from the cold night air
With one enormous chair
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

Lots of chocolate for me to eat
Lots of coal makin' lots of heat
Warm face, warm hands, warm feet
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

Oh so loverly sittin' abso-bloomin'-lutely still
I would never move till Spring crept over mi window sill

Someone's head restin' on my knee
Warm and tender as he can be
Who takes good care of me
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

Elli Fordyce,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April

That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still

My lips could move and talk

I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

I took one look at you

Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,

I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

I have loved to fight for and then some
You are the one, the one, the one, the one,
The one, the one, the one, the one

Wake up in the morning, we're paralyzed
We'll fly into the garden like butterflies
There will be no blood and there will be no pain
I want to fall in love with you again, again,
Again, again, again, again, again, again
Again, again

You have stolen all my senses
There's a fever in my heart
And you are taking my defenses
You are pulling me apart
Forever we are and we are dying
And we still be standing on our ground
So I will take away my feeling
I will be an animal

I'll tie you in my arms, I will smother you
We'll tell each other lies, I will tell the truth
I'll color in the sky, and I'll color you
I want to join your skin again, again,
Again, again, again, again, again, again

I can hear a voice
I need a helping hand
Just to beat the void
I need a mission
A dream to stop me talking to myself

And now the silence is broken
And my soul is to sell
I need to pick up the pieces
To scatter to the wind
Hold the city to your ears
You can hear the wind come in

But you can't change the world with a song
And you can't make it right when it's wrong

I can't stop this music traveling round with me wherever I go
It's playing for you
I can't stop the voice unraveling round me whatever I do
It's talking to you
The world dances to the rhythm of its own
Heart beating for you, however you lose
So speak to me

Don't let it slip, through your fingertips
When there's a ghost
Don't try to reason with it
Because now I'm tired
I'm wired
So I won't miss a think
I rope my words out to dry
And I've forgotten what to sing
But you can't change the world
With a song and you can't make it right when it's wrong

This will always be my home
This will always be my home

I work until its late
Will again close the gates

Every line and every abrasion
This took my life to make
This took my life to make

You have burst at the seams
Let it all fall out open your mouth

Think of things I can make
But I don't seem to have the parts to build them
Human I wonder why you're a better make
Than I could ever build or create,
You know not love or hate
I am so scared of what will kill me
In the end for I am not prepared,
I hope I will get the chance to be someone,
To be human,
Look what we've done,
Look what we've done

I would give my life, to be human
I would give my life, to be human
I would give my life, to be human
I would give my life, to be.

Human I'm trying to come clean,
I will be a better me,
I will not drink until I'm dead
I'll make the most of it.
I don't know what it's like to be alive,
To say goodbye,
To cry a thousand tears
Because my ears won't listen

Human I'm trying not to lose my faith in you,
I've sussed out all that I've seen through,
I've sailed an ocean

I am so scared of what I'll look like in the end
For I am not prepared,
I hope I will get the chance to be someone
To be human,
Look what we've done,
Look what we've done

I used to hear it all so loud,
The sound of my heart breaking.
The truth is waiting to be found,
I trust that I will take it

I would give my life,

Ellie Goulding,"If a plane crashed into my room
I wouldn't even flinch
I couldn't try to move
My mind is on you
My mind is on you

If the streetlight smashed above me
I wouldn't move an inch
Turn the glass into stars
And your face is the moon
And the night turns to you
Cos my mind is on you

You've got me caught in a place
Panic for a minute
Got my brain in a daze
I wish you weren't in it
There are so many ways
To lose your attention
You can break everything
But so I can take anything

I can take anything
I can take anything

If electric charges shock me
I smile and fold my arms
I feel nothing new
Because my mind is on you

My mind is on you

And if the floor gives way to my shoes
I wouldn't try to fly
I cant explain why I feel
I always feel you

I always feel, always feel you

You've got my caught in a place
Panic for a minute
Got my brain in a daze
I wish you weren't in it
There are so many ways
To lose your attention
You can break everything
But so I can take anything

Your the heat in my bones
But you break me with stones

You're the heat in my bones
But you break me with your stones

If a plane crashed into my room
I wouldn't even flinch
I couldnt try to move
My mind is always on you
My mind is always on you

Caught in a place
Panic for a minute
Got my brain in a daze
I wish you weren't in it
There are so many ways
To lose your attention
You can break everything
But so

Even when I'm caught in a place
Panic for a minute
Got my brain in a daze
I wish you weren't in it
There are so many ways
To lose your attention
You can break everything
But so I can take anything",Little Dreams
Ellie Goulding,"It's a little bit funny
This feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can
Easily hide

I don't have much money
But boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where
We both could live.

So excuse me forgetting
But these things I do
See I've forgotten if
They're green or they're blue

Anyway the thing is,
What I really mean,
Yours are the sweetest eyes
I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It maybe quite simple but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
Now you're in the world

If I was a sculptor
But then again no
Or a girl who makes potions in
A traveling show
I know it's not much but
It's the best I can do.
My gift is my song and
This one's for you.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

And you can tell everybody
This is your song

Ellie Goulding,"If I could ask a question
What would it be
There's just too many
Like the stars
You wonder where they start

But it starts with a picture
And it sits in your frame
And we part with a letter
And it ends in my name
And it starts with forever
And it ends with a touch
And I know that you're clever
And I don't ask much

Maybe we forgot

We are together
So, so wake me up
Wake me
I'll stop my fall
When I'm at my weakest
Tape me up
Then break me up
Ever so gently
Then it's not so hard
Every time you go

You said I'm arresting
You said I had heat
I really thought we'd go further
The second time we meet
Cause I'm tired of trying to keep you
All I want to do is sleep
Then perhaps when I'm sleeping
You'll get back on your feet

Maybe we forgot

But it doesn't faze me
You're on time
You move so fast makes me feel lazy
Let's join forces
We've got our guns and horses
I know you've been burned
But every fire is a lesson learned

I left my house
Left my clothes
Door wide open, heaven knows
You're so worth it
You are

But I wish I could feel it all for you
I wish I could be it all for you
If I could erase the pain
Then maybe you'd feel the same
I'd do it all for you, I would
I would, I would, I would

Let's type words
'Cause they amount to nothing
Play it down
Pretend you can't take what you found
But you found me
On a screen you sit at permanently

I left my house
Left my clothes
Door wide open
Heaven knows
You're so worth it, you are

But I wish I could feel it all for you
I wish I could be it all for you
If I could erase the pain
Then maybe you'd feel the same
I'd do it all for you, I would
I would, I would, I would

It's time to come clean,
And make sense of everything
It's time that we found out who we are
'Cause when I'm standing here in the dark
I see your face in every star

But I wish I could feel it all for you
I wish I could be it all for you
If I could erase the pain

Ellie Goulding,"Breathe air you're not used to, tread floors you don't fall through
Make waves
You crash a symbol hard
Follow no one, always play the wrong card
Waste days, in foreign places
Shed lights, on your better side
Reassure me that you'll wait for me, wait for me as long as it takes!

And I'll hold my breath, I'll hold my breath

Until you see me in your dreams
We'll stay awake beneath the trees
We'll watch the buildings turn to dust
A sky of diamonds just for us
You are the risk I'll always take
The only branch I'll never break
Those fears we'll blow them all way

Fight fires in your best clothes, touch skin with your eyes closed
Chase thunder
With the volume down
Pack a suitcase, wonder to the next town
Force quit, on your losing streak
Solve a riddle in a magazine, be tongue in cheek
Tell me that we're still too young, that we're still too young and I'll my tongue

Until you see me in your dreams
We'll stay awake beneath the trees
We'll watch the buildings turn to dust

Those fears we'll blow them all way

I'm here, I'm here to save you
No fall, I will swim to save you

Ellie Goulding,"You're sharp as a knife and you fit like a glove
That is no way to live that is no way to love
Full of fear in your skin and the weakness in giving in
Your stabbed in the back but you feel no pain
Push the heaviest doors that you can't open
Yeah they tied me up and my body lies still, again

You're as bright as the sun and as calm as the wind
I don't know when you'll break but it's gonna be soon
If my will caves in, I'll be in the same boat as you

I've got the salt skin
Running to where he is
Never going to give in
Even with the strength
He's stealing salt skin
Telling me I'm winning
Wars they created
Just to understand
The meaning (of)

Hands on strings and my mouth open
Find the perfect words that I've not spoken
And I won't tell the truth unless you want me to

For all of the times that I lost my head
When it rolled to the floor and I found it again
But when it came back,
I didn't know my own name

I've got the salt skin
Running to where he is
Never going to give in
Even with the strength
He's stealing salt skin
Telling me I'm winning
Wars they created
Just to understand

Ellie Goulding,"Who are we to be emotional
Who are we to play with hearts
And throw away it all
Who are we to turn each others heads
Who are we to find ourselves in other people's beds
I don't like the way I never listen to myself
I feel like I'm on fire, I'm too shy to cry for help
I don't think you know me much at all

This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
I'm feeling down about this love

Who are you to make me feel so good
Who are we to tell ourselves that we're misunderstood
Oh who am I to say I'm always yours
Who am I to choose the boy that everyone adores
Oh I don't see a reason why we can't just be apart
Now we're falling on each other like we're always in the dark
Oh I don't think you warned me much at all

This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall

This love is not what you want
This heart will never be yours

Ellie Goulding,"Why can't we speak another language
One we all agree on
When men look outside, they see houses
Instead of the fields they grew from
We are constantly uprooted from them
Making us tiresome (and fearful)
Can you get up right now
Endeavor to free fall?

You can fall if you want to!
It's just a matter of how far
You've treasured our hometown,
But you've forgotten where you are
And it will stay with you until your mind's been found,
And it has been found wondering around

With that skipping rope, the trampoline,
The crafty smoke that made us choke
But we didn't give up hope
It's just the simple ways of getting paid,
The carelessness of running away
I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed

Patterns all arranged in my background
Pillars and posts keeping this country on form
Letters were all sent
With no addresses so that people can't discover
That we're always under cover
Why do I always draw triangles?
Instead of words this paper deserves

I don't own my clothes but I own my mind,
And it's not what you've lost but it's what you find
I don't own my clothes but I own my mind,
And it's not what you've lost but it's what you find

With that skipping rope, the trampoline,
The crafty smoke that made us choke
But we didn't give up hope
It's just the simple ways of getting paid,
The carelessness of running away

Ellie Goulding,"You wait for a silence
I wait for a word
Lie next to your frame
Girl unobserved
You change your position
And you are changing me
Casting these shadows
Where they shouldn't be

We're interrupted by the heat of the sun
Trying to prevent what's already begun
You're just a body
I can smell your skin
And when I feel it, you're wearing thin

But I've got a plan
Why don't you be the artist, and make me out of clay?
Why don't you be the writer and decide the words I say?
'Cause I'd rather pretend
I'll still be there at the end
Only it's too hard to ask, won't you try to help me

Sat on your sofa, it's all broken springs
This isn't the place for those violin strings
I try out a smile and I aim it at you
You must have missed it
You always do

But I've got a plan
Why don't you be the artist, and make me out of clay?
Why don't you be the writer and decide the words I say?

Signs don't show
You drove me
Off the road

But you let go
'Cause your hope is gone
And every question fades away

It's a shame you don't know what you're running from
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off
Would it take the end of time to hear you heart's false start?

You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained
Well you know this is your biggest mistake

You tread water
Fighting for the air in your lungs
Move
Move closer
Maybe you can right all your wrongs

But you let go
'Cause your hope is gone

Stop pretending
Wipe the mud spray from your face stop the engine,
Stop pretending, that you're still breathing

And I gave in
I lack the things you need the most
You said where have you been
You wasted all that sweetness to run and hide
I wonder why
I remind you of the days you poured your heart into
But you never tried
I've fallen from grace
Took a blow to my face
I've loved and I've lost
I've loved and I've lost

Explosions on the day you wake up
Needing somebody and you've learned
It's okay to be afraid
But it will never be the same
It will never be the same

You left my soul bleeding in the dark
So you could be king
The rules you set are still untold to me and I
Lost my faith in everything
The nights you could cope, your intentions were gold
But the mountains will shake
I need to know I can still make

Explosions on the day you wake up
Needing somebody and you've learned
It's okay to be afraid
But it will never be the same

And as the floods move in
And your body starts to sink
I was the last thing on your mind
I know you better than you think
'Cause it's simple darling, I gave you a warning
Now everything you own is falling from the sky in pieces
So watch them fall with you, in slow motion
I pray that you will find peace of mind
And I'll find you another time
I'll love you, another time

Explosions on the day you wake up
Needing somebody and you've learned
It's okay to be afraid
But it will never be the same",Explosions
Ellie Goulding,"Breathe your smoke into my lungs
In the back of the car with you I stare into the sun
Still not too old to die young
The lovers hold on to everything
And others hold on to anything

I chased your love around a figure 8
I need you more than I can take
You promised forever and a day
And then you take it all away
(And then you take it all away)

Place a kiss on my cheekbone
Then you vanish me
I'm buried in the snow
But something tells me I'm not alone
But lovers hold on to everything
And others hold on to anything

I chased your love around a figure 8
I need you more than I can take
You promised forever and a day
And then you take it all away

So, Lovers hold on to everything
And others hold to anything

Like a last breath you would breathe
You were like home to me
I don't recognize the street

Please don't close your eyes
Don't know where to look without them
Outside the cars speed by
I never heard them until now

I know you care, I know it is always been there
But there is trouble ahead I can feel it
You are just saving yourself when you hide it
Yeah, I know you care
I see it in the way that you stare
As if there was trouble ahead, and you knew it
I'll be saving myself from the ruin
And I know you care

I use to run down the stairs, to the door
And I thought you were there
To shape to the comfort of us

But there is trouble ahead I can feel it
You are just saving yourself when you hide it
Yeah, I know you care
I see it in the way that you stare

But I've never known a winter so cold
Now I don't want my hands in a coat
But I still hope

I'm seeing stars, watch me fall apart

The waves will break every chain on me
My bones will bleach
My flesh will flee
So help my lifeless frame to breathe

And God knows, I'm not dying but I breathe now
And God knows, it's the only way to heal now

It drowns the love I thought I knew

The lost dreams are buried in my sleep for him
And this was the ecstasy of a love forgotten
And I'm thrown in the gunfire of empty bullets

And it plagued the air on my house Ruben

And I know my own fears, I understand

It's a ritual, I know you feel it
It's a ritual, I know you've seen it
It's a ritual, I know you feel it

All the things that matter I forget a lot
I get so caught up in the city cloud
But this place is still my first love

Is there anybody out there waiting for me on my way?
If that somebody is you, then baby, I just wanna say
Tonight, nothing will bring us down
Tonight, we're at the lost and found

Guess I need to run, take me to the bus
But don't let me go, no, don't let me on
Gotta hold me tight, won't put up a fight
Of course I'll stay, I'll stay the night

Is there anybody out there waiting for me on my way?
If that somebody is you, then baby, I just wanna say
Tonight, nothing will bring us down
Tonight, we're at the lost and found

We're at the lost and found

Tonight, nothing will bring us down
Tonight, yeah, we're at the lost and found

Ellie Goulding,"Oh
Oh oh oh, hey

It's a little dirty how the whole thing started
I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down
Next thing that I know I'm in the hotel with you
You were talking deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down

And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand

Why I got you on my mind, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh

I always hear, always hear them talking
Talking 'bout a girl, 'bout a girl with my name
Saying that I hurt you but I still don't get it
You didn't love me, no, not really
Wait, I could have really liked you
I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinking 'bout you
It's a shame (shame), you said I was good
So I poured it down, so I poured it down

Why I got you on my mind

You got yourself in a dangerous zone
'Cause we both have the fear, fear of being alone

Ellie Goulding,"I've been filling in the blanks
You left me with your open hands
I never knew what I had to do
Stumbling out in the dark
You left me with a question mark
You said the bridges had to be burned

And it's a pain that only we know
Oh and you lost all on your own
Always has to be a new scare
To keep us falling over the edge

So, have another drink
Have another drink, call me
If this is what it takes
If it's what it takes, baby
Dream another dream
'Cause you're killing it, honey
This is what we do to get by

We're always chasing that paradise
Paradise, paradise, paradise

There's a place we try to reach
Impossible as it would seem
I heard you crying out in your sleep
I see that look you save for me
I pull you back upon your feet
I know you always need something more, more

And it's a thing that only we know
Oh and you lost all on your own
Always has to be a new scare
To keep us falling over the edge

So, have another drink
Have another drink, call me
If this is what it takes
If it's what it takes, baby
Dream another dream
'Cause you're killing it, honey
This is what we do to get by

We're always chasing that paradise, paradise
We're always chasing that paradise, paradise

I know we're headed for a moment, baby
We made sense of it
I know I struck you so reckless, honey
We gave into it
Paradise, I know we're headed for a moment, baby
We made sense of it
Paradise, I know I struck you so reckless, honey
We gave in

So, have another drink

Ellie Goulding,"I think I'll let fate just take me home
'Cause over pain, love is outgrown
I've never won a fight to understand
I just move as my heart commands

I've always had a thing for silence
But lately I just need a voice I recognise
Baby, it's perfect timing now to

Scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down
So scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down

Have you found peace with your mistakes?
Breathing on the glass as it breaks
Have you found the words to save her
And keep your heart out of danger?

And I don't think I can take the violence
And lately I just need a voice I recognize
Baby, it's perfect timing now to

Scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down
So scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down

Ellie Goulding,"Reaching higher than towers
Wasn't anywhere we couldn't went
We had unbreakable powers
When our bodies meet, it's everything
This is was a beautiful vision
Even love was not a way you could describe it
And then there comes a collision
Nothing ever goes in the night

And they're not lost forever
Lost what once was here
It's now just spots
Now the fireworks are fading
Is it over?
Lost you in the summer two years ago

You, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
You, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago

If there's no storm, why're we a shipwreck?
Thought our love is insurmountable
He knows my heart is still aching
Never thought it would be caused by you

We're not lost forever
Lost what once was here
It's now just spots
Now the fireworks are fading

Two years ago
There's a part of me that still believes that we belong
Two years ago
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Moving on, moving on, moving on

And the reason I can't forget is I think you do too
I know you think of me, too
I'll use this moment to really forget
I will soon, but for now
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you

It's heartache through and through
There's something in the way you move

Not one bone in your body good enough for me
But this heart is open, bloodstain on my sleeve
When our eyes meet, I can only see the end
But tonight I'm here, yours again

But tonight I'm gonna lose it all

There's nothing left for me to lose
There's not one thing I can do to change your ways

That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger

Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy

But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears

But I still don't feel intelligent, I'd smile if I could
You're the only face I'll ever miss, the one that makes me smile
I'm distraught about the way you left, in the city lovers die
They assessed how much I loved you, it's too much to give a grade

And I wish you weren't gone
You can disconnect my heart
Cause I feel so far 
Away from everything
Away from everyone

I can feel the weight of my decision pinching at my spine
I've become my own worst enemy, this smile's hiding lies
And if I could I'd cramp the distance, that's made our hearts grow weak
You're the only face I'll ever miss, but never get to meet
And I can't breathe without you close
And I'm sick of all my clothes
I'm finding things a bit too much

All the tender lov you've given to me
I want you more and more
Can't resist you
More than I feel your touch
Tender love
Lovin me straight from the heart
Holy mirror
Please let me be a part
Of all the tender love you've given to me

Tender love (tender love)
Love so tender (aaaaaaah)
Holdin me close to you
Baby I surrender

Ooooooooooooh...yeah...surrender baby....ooooooh...",Tender Love
Elliot Levine,"I've been thinking in between breaks from drinking
About the the things you said concerning my singing

Oh, you said the top ten billboards, I could break in
Tell me are you for real or just faking?
I grow up and you think the hippies would dig me
I would work on my flow if you thought I had hip-hop in me

To impress the girls I'd work on my sensitivity
As for my debts, who's proud for punk crowd longevity

CHORUS
And if you told me that I could be famous
I present you with a list of changes I could make
We could fake the world out

It's all 'cause of us I'd caused shotgun on the tour bus
Playing every show shirt lest ladies would adore us
Throwing pennies on stage at every single chorus
Then we'd break up the band 'cause all this money bores us

CHORUS

We could fake the world out (x3)

Wake up kids
We've got the dreamers disease
Age 14 we got you down on your knees
So polite, you're busy still saying please
Frienemies, who when you're down ain't your friend
Every night we smash their Mercedes-Benz
First we run,and then we laugh 'til we cry

But when the night is falling
You cannot find the light
You feel your dreams are dying
Hold tight

You've got the music in you
Don't let go
You've got the music in you
One dance left
This world is gonna pull through
Don't give up
You've got a reason to live
Can't forget
We only get what we give

I'm comin' home baby
You're tops
Give it to me now

Four a.m. we ran a miracle mile
We're flat broke
But hey we do it in style
The bad rich
God's flying in for your trial

But when the night is falling
You cannot find a friend (friend)
You feel your tree is breaking
Just then

You've got the music in you
Don't let go
You've got the music in you
One dance left
This world is gonna pull through
Don't give up
You've got a reason to live
Can't forget

This whole damn world, could fall apart
You'll be ok, follow your heart
You're in harms way, I'm right behind
Now say you're mine

You've got the music in you
Don't let go
You've got the music in you
One dance left
This world is gonna pull through
Don't give up
You've got a reason to live

I feel the music in you
Don't let go
Fly high
What's real, can't die
You only get what you give
You are gonna get what you give
Don't give up
Just don't be afraid to leave
Health insurance rip off lying
FDA big bankers buying
Fake computer crashes dining
Cloning while they're multiplying
Fashion shoots with Beck and Hanson
Courtney Love, and Marilyn Manson
You're all fakes run to your mansions
Come around we'll kick your ass in

I'm the furthest from someone,
I'm the chord that wont resolve,
A craze that won't belong,
And I just cannot leave,
I keep on burning from the heat,
I'm blinded from the spill,
Of light here she shines on me.

[Chorus]
And oh she's bringing in, she's bringing in the light,
And I'm, I'm getting it, I get it I'm alive
So don't count on your satellites,
To say she's here tonight,
Just know she's bringing in, 
She's bringing in the light.

Oh she likes to lead,
Every way she lead me on,
She took the ground beneath my feet,
And drew me closer to the sun,
My mind is spinning right to the edge,
I'm veering out of control,
She gracefully reels me in,
And oh, here she comes, here she goes.

By the side congratulations all you want 
But you're as good as you're design revised 
You slowly let it all just drop a pretty face 
With your pretty little smile and its time 
To say its all a little fake these constellations 
Are in line and ill just let it

You tried to make me if you're on your way 
Then I'll understand you move on my wake 
And I'll understand you fly on your way

You sent back distraction you fire 
On my direction fire me up with confidence

This and anyway you fit the distraction

With a letter home you found its hard to wait 
You lace yourself with a cool colored confident ring

You found it hard when everyone's high 
You call on the contract to the states its to hard 
To wait lay on the runway to the sky you found it hard 

When everyone's high feel the loss of weight 
Can you remember the deals you had to face
