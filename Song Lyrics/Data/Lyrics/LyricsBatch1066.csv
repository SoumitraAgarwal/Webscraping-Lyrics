Norfolk Singers,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street
Noriega,"Linda estrella
Dibujame tu nombre
En todita las estrellas
Pues, cada vez que la lluvia cae
Siento que pierdo la cabeza
Yo por ti, dime si tu por mi
Linda estrella
Dibujame tu nombre
En todita las estrellas
Pues, cada vez que la veo pasar
Siento que pierdo la cabeza
Yo por ti, dime si tu por mi

Es que te quiero tanto why tanto
Que escribiré tu nombre en la arena
why un ""Te Amo"" en la marea
Allá en el mar del sentimiento
Porque te quiero tanto why tanto
Linda estrella, voy a pintar tu nombre
Dentro de algún hoguera
A ver si así me quema
Linda, si supieras
Que con solo pensar en ti
Algo se acelera muy dentro de mi
escribiré el bello nombre de mi estrella
En una nube de la colina La Pradera
Para que el cielo te abraze why te desnude
En un linaje bajo la luna
Por que te quiero tanto why tanto
Que escribiré tu nombre en la arena
Mas allá del firmamento
Para que al fin me creas

Todo empezó como un cuento de hadas
Donde me enamore de una modelo que sale en portadas
No despertaba, aun su imagen miraba
why que me pasa, yo como un loco un papel besaba
Haría lo que fuera por sacarte del papel
Besar tu linda boquita que me hare enloquecer
Vente conmigo, mami, pa' llenarte de placer
why dime si esto no lo quieres hacer
why embriagarnos con un vino tinto
Soy tu nene atrevido
Quiero comerte el ombligo
Niña, escápate conmigo
Pa' que pruebes sexo fino
why llegar a las estrellas
Buscar entre todas
Mi estrella mas bella

Es que te quiero tanto why tanto
Que escribiré tu nombre en la arena
why un ""Te Amo"" en la marea
Allá en el mar del sentimiento
Por que te quiero tanto why tanto
Mas allá del firmamento
Para que al fin me creas",Linda Estrella
Norm,"Hey, Venus, oh, Venus
Hey, Venus, oh, Venus
Venus, if you will
Please send a little girl for me to thrill
A girl who wants my kisses and my arms
A girl with all the charms of you
 
Venus, make her fair
A lovely girl with sunlight in her hair
And take the brightest stars up in the skies 
And place them in her eyes for me
 
Venus, goddess of love that you are
Surely the things I ask
Can't be too great a task
 
Venus, if you do
I promise that I always will be true
I'll give her all the love I have to give
As long as we both shall live
 
Hey, Venus, oh, Venus
Make my wish come true

Norm Douglas,"I can only give you love that lasts forever,
And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more, that's all, that's all.",That's All
Norm Kubrin,"I took a trip on a train
And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do, I thought about you

There were two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And then I peeped through the crack
And I looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do, I thought about you",I Thought About You
Norm Kubrin,"Why did I wander
Hereand there and yonder,
Wasting precious time
For no reason or rhyme?
Isn't it a pity!
Isn't it a crime!
My journey is ended,
Everything is splendid;
Meeting you today
Has given me a wonderful idea 
Here I stay!

It's a funny thing;
I look at you,
I get a thrill I never knew,
Isn't it a pity we never met before!

Here we are at last,
It's like a dream,
The two of us, a perfect team,
Isn't it a pity we never met before!

Imagine all the lonely years we've wasted,
You with the neighbours,
I at silly labours!
What joys untasted,
You readin Heine,
Me somewhere in China!

Let's forget the past, let's both agree
That I'm for you and you're for me,
And it's such a pity we never, never met before!

Imagine all the lonely years we've wasted,
Fishing for salmon,
Losing at backgammon!
What joys untasted,
My nights were sour,
Spent with Schopenhauer!

Let's forget the past, let's both agree
That I'm for you and you're for me,
And it's such a pity we never, never met before!",Isn't It a Pity?
Norm Kubrin,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you",Love Walked In
Norm Kubrin,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Norm Kubrin,"Summer me, winter me
And with your kisses, morning me, evening me
And as the world slips far away, a star away
Forever me with love

Wonder me, wander me
Then by a fire pleasure me, peaceful me
And in the silence quietly, whisper me
Forever me with love

And every day I'll gentle you, tender you
And, oh, the way I'll velvet you, clover you
I'll wrap you up and ribbon you, rainbow you
And shower you with shine

Suddenly, magically, we found each other
There we were, here we are
I plan to let you happy me, summer me, winter me, always

Norm Kubrin,"Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

",Where Do You Start
Norm Kubrin,"You make me feel so young
You make me feel as though spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy in-div-dual

The moment that you speak 
I wanna go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots 
Runnin' across the meadow 
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel so young 
You make me feel there are songs to be sung Bells to be rung 
And a wonderful spring to be sprung
And even when I'm old and gray 
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cos you make me feel so young",You Make Me Feel So Young
Norm Lewis,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty
Norma Eliza,"When I said I needed you
You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed but you and now you've gone away
Don't you see that now you've gone
And I'm left here on my own
That I have to follow you and beg you to come home

You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever I will understand
Believe me, believe me I can't help but love you
But believe me I'll never tie you down
Left alone with just a memory
Life seems dead and quite unreal
All that's left is loneliness there's nothing left to feel

You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand believe me, believe me
You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand, believe me, believe me",You Don't Have to Say You Love Me
Norma Jean,"Once I thought your love I'd win but your old flame showed up in town again
Now I know your love I lose I've got a one way ticket to the blues
I've got a one way ticket to the world that's full of tears
All my dreams and hopes are gone we built up through the years
Seems I can't win I always lose I've got a one way ticket to the blues

Norma Jean,"Why why why can't you understand
That golden wedding band you wear on your left hand means that you're mine
Why why why can't I make you see though you still think you're free
Your heart belongs to me till the end of time
I love you more than words can ever say my heart would break if you should go away
No one could love you like I do and I die a little more each time that you're untrue
Why why why can't you understand

Why can't you be true the way you were why do you keep running back to her
I pray each minute I'm alone that you'll forget her soon and find your way back home
Why why why can't you understand",Why

The key to my heart you hold in your hand
And nothing else matters we're together again

Norma Jean,"Tonight they're singing in the villas tomorrow you'll be gone so far
Hold me close and say you love me while Amigo plays his blue guitar
Ay ay ay ay the moon is lonely tomorrow I'll wonder where you are
Manana morning my darling I'll be blue as Amigo's guitar

They've hushed their singing in the villas all is quiet beneath the stars
Amigo plays Hasta Luego upon his lonely blue guitar

Norma Jean,"You'll hear talk around town of things I used to do
Some will try to poison your mind that my love can't be true
Many nights I lay awake dear hopin' our love will last
Wonderin' if your love is strong enough to forget about my past
I don't claim to be an angel my life's been full of sin
But when I met you darling that all came to an end
Never doubt my love dear whatever you may do
I don't claim to be an angel but my love for you is true
[ fiddle ]
I never knew what real love was till you came along
You changed my outlook on life made me regret my wrongs
Why should my past keep haunting me all through the years
I paid for my mistakes with millions of bitter tears
I don't claim to be an angel...




",I Don't Claim to Be an Angel
Norma Jean,"Searching I've spent the lifetime darling searching looking for someone like you
Dreaming in all my dreams I dream that someday I'll find someone just like you

Other loves have come my way but they were not for me

Other loves have come my way",Searching
Norma Jean,"I just came in here from force of habit I don't intend to spend too much time in here
But I heard you headin' for the teardrops and if you play A-11 there'll be tears
I don't know you from Adam but if you're gonna play the jukebox
Please don't play A-11

Oh this used to be our favorite nightspot and when he was here it was heaven
It was here he first told me that he loved me and he always played A-11

Please don't play A-11",A-11
Norma Jean,"For a long long time now just about every night
You found some excuse not to hold me tight
No matter what I do you sit and pout
Don't let that doorknob hit you going out

Don't let that doorknob hit you going out honey
Others lips now thrill you there's no doubt
There's no burden like the love you make me live without
Don't let that doorknob hit you going out

I've laid awake nights to two or three
So near to you but you're so far from me

Norma Jean,"Oh mama I'm excited I'm almost out of breath
When I saw the light that made me run myself to death
I was on the mountain side when I looked down below
And glory be I thought I'd better come and let you know
That we got company's comin' company's comin' we got company comin' up the road
They're down the road about a mile they'll be here in a little while
There's company comin' up the road
Well Granny change your apron and Willie shine your shoes
Sally put your new dress on we got no time to lose
I'll go find a welcome mat and spread it out with cheer

Well run out to the henhouse and wring a neck or two
We'll have chicken and dumplings and some yellow gravy too

Well let them all shout out aloud they'll be here in a minute now

",Company's Comin'
Norma Jean,"What would you do what would you do if Jesus came to spend some time with you
If Jesus came to your house to spend a day or two
If he came unexpectedly I wonder what you'd do
When you saw him comin' would you meet him at the door
With arms outstretched and welcome to your heavenly visitor

Or would you need to change some things before you'd let him in
Like to burn some magazines and put the Bible where they'd been
Oh I know you'd give your nicest room to such an honered guest
And all the food you'd serve to him would be the very best
But what about your family conversation would it keep up its normal pace

And would you find it hard each meal to say a table grace
Would you be glad to have him meet your very closest friends
Or hope that maybe they'd stay away until his visit ends
Would you be glad to have him stay forever on and on

Or sigh of great relief when finally he'd gone
You know it might be interesting to know the things you'd do
If Jesus came in person to spend some time with you
What would you do what would you do if Jesus came to spend some time with you",What Would You Do

Gonna need another little diaper maybe
No need a hesitatin' or a wonderin' and a waitin'

Well mommy tippy toeing daddy tippy toeing too gonna try to do a little sleepin' maybe
Whether it'll be a minute or an hour or two is depending entirely on the baby

Cause honey just last night that you went and shamed me
You opened up your arms and you let another woman come in
Don't put your hands on me after they been on her
Don't put your lips on mine after you let 'em flirt

Norma Jean,"""Good morning, sir, what'll you have?"" That's how I start my day
I spend nearly half my life in this little dim cafe
I listen to their troubles, I'd try to be their friend
But heaven help the working girl in a world that's run by men

Oh, heaven help the working girl
Then goin' gets rough in this old world
Filled with men who spend their time
Tellin' lies, breathin' sighs, gettin' wise
Havin' cries and drinkin' too much wine

Thank you, sir, you're very kind, I think I'll pass this time
We'd both be sorry if I did go home to your wife and your kids
It's just the bottle talkin', I'm familiar with that sound
Oh, heaven help the working girl till true love comes around

Norma Jean,"You were mine for just a while now you're puttin' on the style
And you've never once looked back at your home across the track
You're the gossip of the town but my heart can still be found
Where you tossed it on the ground pick me up on your way down
Pick me up on your way down when you're blue and all alone
When their glamour starts to bore you come on back where you belong
You may be their pride and joy but they'll find another toy
Then they'll take away your crown pick me up on your way down

They have changed your attitude made you haughty and so rude

Norma Jean,"What locks the door to the world you're living in?
What kind of key do I need to get in?
I tried anything from solid gold to cent
What locks the door to the world you're living in?

You can't relive your past with the dream that's gone
You can't find love that will last in your world alone
A hurt so tall has built the wall where fate begins
What locks the door to the world you're living in?

Now and then a little box of candy sometimes an occasional flowers

To make a woman love you is easy as long as you know what to do

A little bit of bein' faithful and true a few words like I love you

Remember her name is recorded on the pages of God's holy word
Desiring to lower her standards they watch every move that she makes
For they long to find fault with her teaching but really they find no mistakes

I am glad I have learned of her meekness I am proud that my name's on her book
For I want to be one never fearing the face of my Savior's true look
When he comes descending from heaven on the clouds as he write in his word

Then Jersus came like a stranger in the night praise the Lord I saw the light

How they linger ever near me and the sacred past unfolds
Precious memories how they linger how they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight precious sacred scenes unfold

Norma Jean,"Well I was born a coal miner's daughter in a cabin on a hill in Butcher Holler
We were poor but we had love that's the one thing that daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar

My Daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mine all day long in the field hoein' corn
Mommy rocked the babies at night and read the Bible by the coal oil light
And everything would start all over come break of morn

Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a wash board everday
Well I've seen her fingers bleed to complain there was no need
She'd smile in mommy's understanding way

In the summer time we didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair
From the mail order catalog money made from selling a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere

Yeah I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter I remember well the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard at night we'd sleep cause we were tired
I never thought of ever leavin' Butcher Holler

But a lots of things have changed since the way back then
And it's so good to be back home again
Not much left but the floor nothing lives there anymore
Except the memories of a coal miner's daughter

Cause this morning he's just leaving but come sundown he'll be gone

I see his memory on his pillow that I placed beneath his head

You're so heavenly heavenly being loved by you makes this world heaven to me
I hear church bells ring I hear angels sing
When you're with me cause you're so heavenly

But you don't find roses growing on stalks of clover so you better think it over

I would give you the world right now on a silver platter but what would it matter

Norma Jean,"A canvas covered cabin in a crowded labor camp
Stands out in this memory I revive
Cause my daddy raised a family there with two hard working hands
And tried to feed my mama's hungry eyes
He dreamed of something better and my mama's faith was strong
And us kids were just too young to realize
That another class of people put us somewhere just below
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes
Mama never had the luxuries she wanted but it wasn't cause my daddy didn't try

She only wanted things she really needed
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes
I remember daddy praying for a better way of life
But I don't recall a change of any size

I wish I had a wooden heart and a sawdust smile

I'd have a sewed on smile and a painted twinkle in my eye
And I never would've ever had to learn how to cry
I wish I was a Teddy Bear not livin' nor lovin' or goin' nowhere...

I found the shirt he'd worn when he held me in his arms for the very last time

As I took it from the rack all my dreams came racin' back
The faint perfume of sweet love filled the night
I could see his face again he kissed my lips as then
And I almost felt his arms around me tight
A shirt that even the Gods must envy
For its arms once encircled the dream that only heaven can bring
Inside this shirt had beaten the most wonderful heart in the whole wide world
And forever each thread shall remind me of him
I turned down a rolled up sleeve and I scaresly could believe
When I looked and saw a strand of my own hair
It was clinging like a vine to the shirt he left behind
As if to let him know that I still care
I walked to the window sill and my eyes began to fill
And I thought I heard the soft wind call his name
And the shirt across my arm grew strangely soft and warm
As if I'd reached and held it to a flame
And there I stood hearing only the beat of my own aching heart
Lost in the dreams that might have been
And the shirt seemed as sorrowful as I and just as empty body and soul",The Shirt

A world of hurt, a heart of false hope

And while we thought
That we were learning how to live
We have been learning how to die
I should have known, we will be legends

Our homes and dreams
And our worst nightmares
Our worst nightmares have now come true

Tonight when this detain falls on men
Driven by an instinct more powerful than life itself
From horror to hope
From hope to devastation

And while we thought
That we were learning how to live
We have been learning how to die
I should have known, we will be legends

Norma Lewis,"Nobody can tell ya;
There's only one song worth singin',
They may try and sell ya,
'Cause it hangs them up to see someone like you.
But you've gotta make your own music
Sing your own special song,
Make your own kind of music even if nobody else sings along.
You're gonna be knowing
The loneliest kind of lonely,
It may be rough goin',
Just to do your thing's the hardest thing to do.
But you've gotta make your own music
Sing your own special song,
Make your own kind of music even if nobody else sings along.
So if you cannot take my hand,
And if you must be goin',
I will understand.
But you've gotta make your own music
Sing your own special song,
Make your own kind of music even if nobody else sings along.",Make Your Own Kind of Music
Norma Waterson,"Will there be any bartenders up there in heaven?
Will the pubs never close? Will the glass never drain?
No more DTs and no shakes and no horrors
The very next morning, you feel right as rain

'Cause God loves a drunk, lowest of men
Like the dogs in the street and the pigs in the pen
But a drunk's only trying to get free of his body
And soar like an eagle high up there in heaven
His shouts and his curses they are just hymns and praises
To kick-start his mind now and then
O God loves a drunk, come raise up your glasses, amen

Does God really care for your life in the suburbs?
Your dull little life full of dull little things
And bring up the babies to be just like daddy
And maybe I'll be there when he gives out the wings

But God loves a drunk, although he's a fool
Oh he wets in his pants and he falls off his stool
And he can't hear the insults, and whispers go by him
As he leans in the doorway and he sings sally racket
He can't feel the cold rain beat down on his body
And soak through his clothes to the skin
O God loves a drunk, come raise up your glasses, amen

Will there be any pen-pushers up there in heaven?
Does crawling and wage-slaving win you God's love?
I pity you worms with your semis and pensions
If you think that'll get you to the kingdom above

Oh God loves a drunk, although he's a clown
Oh you can't help but laugh as he gags and falls down
But he don't give a curse for what people think of him
He screams at his demons alone in the darkness
He's staying alive for just one more pint bottle
Won't you throw him a few pennies, friend?
Ah God loves a drunk, for ever and ever, amen",God Loves a Drunk
Norma Waterson,"I'm leaving here on the morning train
And I will never see this world again
I've felt pleasure
And I have felt pain
And I know now
That I can never be the same

How I wonder why the world can be so cold
And if only good die young
Then left with me cruel here to grow old
And I felt pleasure
And I felt pain
And I know now
I can never be the same

And if someday I find my peace of mind
I will share my wealth with all of human kind
I've felt pleasure
And I have felt pain
And I know now
That I can never be the same

So if the sun does shine or rain does fall
I give thanks I've had my sight to see through it all
And I've felt pleasure
And I've felt pain
And I know now
That I can never be the same",Pleasure and Pain
Norma Winstone,"On every tree there sits a bird, singing a song of love
On every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard 
Could break my heart without a word singing a song of love
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
 
A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Watchin' good time Charlie friend is drivin' me insane
Down on shady Charlotte Street the green lights look red
Wish I was back home on the farm in my feather bed

Get myself a rockin' chair
To see if I can lose
Them thin dime hard times

Found myself a paper friend who's read yesterday's news
Folded up page twenty-one and stuck it in my shoe
Gave a nickel to the poor my good turn for the day
Folded up my old billfold threw it far away

Lord I wish I had some guitar strings Old Black Diamond brand
I'd string up this old Martin box and go and join some band
But I guess I'll just stay right here just pick and sing a while
Try to make me a little change and give them folks a smile",Church Street Blues
Norman Blake,"Here upon the quiet country village stood the maple on the hill
There I sat with my Jeannie of long ago
When the stars were shining brightly we could hear the whippoorwill
As we sat beneath the maple on the hill
We would sing love songs together when the birds had gone to rest
And we'd listened to the murmur of the leaves
Then you throwed your arms around me laid your head upon my chest
As we sat beneath the maple on the hill
[ piano ]
Now we're getting old and feeble and our hair is turning grey
We no longer hear the rippling of the leaves
Still I always love you darling as I did those stary nights
When we sat beneath the maple on the hill
Don't forget me little darling as they lay me down to rest
Will you keep this final promise that you gave
While you linger there in silence thinking only of the past
May your teardrops kiss the flowers on my grave
Even now i hear the angels coming o'er the hill
So goodbye my little darling, yes the time has come to part
I must leave you and the maple on the hill

To enter my life, enter my life

I try to think positive
I pray for someone good to come

Norman Connors,"We don't exist
We are nothing but shadow and mist
In the mirror we look as we pass
No reflection's revealed in the glass
Don't you know that the blood in your vein is as lifeless as yesterday's rain?
It's a game where we come to conceal the confusion we feel
But as long as we're nameless our bodies are blameless
You cried when we kissedIt was nothing but shadow and mist
Two illusions who touch in a trancemaking love not by choice but by chance
To a theme that we tore from the past to a tango we swore was the last
We are shadows who dance
We don't exist
We are nothing but shadow and mist
In the mirror we look as we pass
No reflection's revealed in the glass
Don't you know that the blood in your veinis as lifeless as yesterday's rain?

To see me through
Until my life is through 

Well, in my mind, we can conquer the world
In love you and I, you and I, you and I 
I am glad at least in my life I found someone 
That may not be here forever to see me through

I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day
Because that's all that I am living for, you see

Norman Connors,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's

Oh yeah, gonna walk on by

Your sea it can freezing, I thought I'd float
I sink deeper blue, by you I'm consumed

Norman Doray,"Man, women, boy, women, girl
Women without a man is nothing
Without her, man is nothing
Women have their faults
Men only have two
Everything they say and everything they do
Men who have pierced ears are better prepared for marriage
They've experienced pain
And have bought jewelry
Women have two weapons
Cosmetics and tears
I'm a perfect house keeper
Every time I leave a man I keep his house
No women has ever hated a man
Enough to give him back his diamonds
Why don't women blink during foreplay?
They don't have time
Man, women, boy, women, girl
Men forget everything
Women remember everything
A girl can wait for the right man to come along
But it doesn't stop her from having fun
With all the wrong ones in the mean time
The real reason why it's so difficult to find men
Who are sensitive, caring and good looking?
Is because they all have boyfriends already
A successful man is one who makes more money
Than his wife can spend
A successful women is one who can find such a man
Man, women, boy, women, girl
Women driver really means
Someone who doesn't speed, tailgates
Swear, make obscene gestures
And has a better driving record than men have
It's a guy thing really means
Irrational, illogical, stupid and extremely low
Oh don't fuss I just cut myself, it's no big deal
Really means I'm about to die but before I die
I want you to remember me as a strong proud man
Who never cries
Man, women, boy, women, girl
If you want to learn more about women
Watch 'Sex in the City'
If you want to learn more about men
Take a good look at Homer Simpson
The difference between light and hard
Is that men can sleep all night with a light on",Reach [Yin Yang Dub]

I need your strength, 
I need your tender touch
I need the love, my dear, I miss so much.
 
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
From this old world I try to hide my face,
But from this loneliness there's no hiding place.
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell,
in darkness with memories I know so well.
 
I need your love more than before,
I can hardly carry on anymore.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe, 
without you babe,without you babe,
My mind and soul have felt like this,
Since love between us no more exist.
And each time that darkness falls,
if finds me alone with these four walls.

Norman Jay,"Go 
Go to the mountain if you must
Go to the burning bush
Happy would ease your troubled mind
How do the fade just stay behind?

I know you better than you think I do
Don't worry .. this is why I fell in love with you
The man in the looking glass
Is looking back at you at last

You can't hide from the truth
Because the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth
Because the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth
Because the truth is all there is
You can't hide

If happy times are too few and far between
It's a pity dear, we can't erase the things we've seen
So disappear, vanish if you wish
Just go before you're swallowed up by bitterness

And the truth is you can't hide from the truth
And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is
I realized some time ago that I would have to let you go

May not be true to see that you would return one day
But in your present state you may as well not be here at all
You wear a thin disguise, it's from yourself you hide
Just take a look at us, we are heading for a fall

Now presiding in this quarter: hip-hop
Justice, my rap forté
Judge, jury, bailing for prosecuting D.A.
Et ceteras, paraphas
My modus operende
It's carpe diem whether the fact or word is your way
Comprende?
The people versus, you ain't no Sensi
Teaching that style of word-play
We got the words they
Regardless of what your friends say
They're all disable
Striken from the record and deemed indimissable
And this long arm of the law grabs a mightier
Shoot dope lines first and ask questions later
The sentence of this live litigator
Close the case tighter than the jaws of a 'gator
Stenonographer, that study law again, the jargon
Let your counselors 'a barking, in hopes of a plea bargain
But when you read back verbatim
What they're saying to persuade them
They realize exactly how I've played them
I come with the truth, whole truth and nothing but
'Cause the truth hurts just as much as in' with lies will
I brew skill with free fills from now until
Plagiarizing MC's get their flows distilled

Baby I don't die without you by my side
As long as you return into these arms that burn
Baby I won't die just take a look inside
Into these eyes that burn, come to these arms that yearn

I won't die, if you leave me high
I won't die if you're not by my side

And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is
And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth

Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,

And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Norrie Paramor,"Moonlight and magnolia, starlight in your hair
All the world a dream come true
Did it really happen, was I really there, was I really there with you?
 
We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight

Norrie Paramor,"When ever we kiss,
I worry and wonder.
Your lips may be near,
but where is your heart?

It's always like this,
I worry and wonder.
You're close to me here,
but where is your heart?

It's a sad thing to realize 
that you've a heart that never melts.
When we kiss, do you close your eyes,
pretending that I'm someone else?

You must break the spell,
this cloud that I'm under.
So please won't you tell, darling,
where is your heart?

Norrie Paramor,"There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon

I'm going to pick that rose 
And watch her as she grows in my garden

Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall

Now the rainman gave me two cures,
Then he said, ""Jump right in.""
The one was Texas medicine,
The other was just railroad gin.
An' like a fool I mixed them
An' it strangled up my mind,
An' now people just get uglier
An' I have no sense of time.
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end,
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again.

When Ruthie says come see her
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
Where I can watch her waltz for free
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
An' I say, ""Aw come on now,
You must know about my debutante.""
An' she says, ""Your debutante just knows what you need
But I know what you want.""
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end,
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again.

Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
Where the neon madmen climb.
They all fall there so perfectly,
It all seems so well timed.
An' here I sit so patiently
Waiting to find out what price
You have to pay to get out of
Going through all these things twice.
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end,
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again.",Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again

Of the sweetest girl in town.

Staring blind around - 
Am I slipping away?
In the hollow decorating my grave
Begging please...
Disconnect the pain

When you're going blind 
From your tears 
And you wander deeper 
And deeper into sorrow
For each step you take
And your feet won't carry 
You no more
And you sink deeper 
And deeper into misery
And you'll soon be...dead

...so dim the light in me...
...no nothing...
...all ending...",Dead
Norther,"Closed around
The deepening shades of death 
And life 
With all its glory fades away
No glory there has ever been in 
Life obscure

Life deceiving
Death revealing

Like trapped in a cage, 
We're bound to death
Slaves to our bodies, 
From cradle to the grave
Abandoned, 
In the arms of a plague
All efforts in vain, 
Life is pain
Reaching the truth, 
Death is the proof
Reveals the truth

When the day is done 
I'm back again

Tonight's the night to die 
You can try to run

Norther,"I'm caught by the mirror, 
It's like a nightmare, 
I cannot get out
I'm seeing that face again 
And it's making me mad
My rage and hate is taking over 
When you look at me
So I close my eyes 
And you scream to me

Leave me alone,
You're not real to me
This is the way it has to be
This mirror is twisted 
And so are you

Hey you, in the mirror
Stop twisting my weak mind
Mirror of madness, 
Stop haunting me

Hey you, before the mirror
Your eyes keep telling you lies
Mirror of madness, 
Is making you insane

Fuck off my mind, 
I told you to go 
But you don't believe 
So I'm forced to deceive
There is no other way 
To end this day
I believe you are real 
And you live in me
But you have to die
Step into the light, 
Don't be shy

You keep on telling me your lies, 
""Kill yourself and it's alright""
Don't want to die but I hope you do

Hey you, in the mirror
I'll smash your face to pieces

Come tonight my child
See the end of a sinful life
The end of mischievous lies

So I went among the crowd
The whispers cursed her name
Then through the people's frantic shout
She was brought to be tested by the flame

And I saw her smile
As the flames rose
She looked up to the sky
And the air froze
Something in her eyes

Too much for the narrow minds
Condemned as an evil whore
She didn't mind, 'cause deep inside
She had reached something more

And I saw her smile
As the flames rose
She looked up to the sky
And the air froze
Something in her eyes
Of darkness and light

And I saw her smile
As the flames rose
I looked into her eyes
I saw that she knows
Things beyond this life
Of darkness and light",Of Darkness and Light
Norther,"Night falls, it's time to kill
This fist will give you the thrill
Your blood is running like the rain
You are begging, no more pain
My need to kill grows bigger and bigger
When I touch the trigger
This bullet that I will send
Is the bringer of your death

I'm the god that you will need
Hatred and death sleep in my bed
In my eyes you're not doing well
Keep on praying before I unleash hell

Time will tell 
When I unleash hell
Blood will flow 
When I unleash hell

Bullets fly, I pulled the trigger
Revenge is mine, sweet and bitter
Welcome to my hell on earth
This time you'll get hurt
I reload my gun, get ready to run
Fuck your life I'm just having fun
Your time is up, I'll never stop
I'll make you rot, I'll fill your grave

Time will tell 
When I unleash hell
Blood will flow 
When I unleash hell

Now your world is gone
You're not around to see the dawn
Or the things that I will do
But you know, it's all for you
Today this world will meet it's god
I'll end this shit with a flood of blood

Norther,"Surrounding endless darkness
Screaming echoing silence
Embraced by shadows
They tear me apart
I'm nothing, that's all I am
I dwell in me, in the core of my agony

Within myself, think I'm lost again
Feels like I'm fading away
Close my eyes, a sudden change into a state
Where life is dust and everything flows
Circling above around
Something grabs me, pulling me down, I'm falling

Falling further down, falling down, down in black
Falling further down, no way out, no way back

Norther,"Tieng my own noose, digging my own grave
They told me to do it before it is too late
Pale faces in the night told me the truth about life
They told me facts that I could not deny

Picking flowers for my own funeral
Building the coffin to sleep in
Sharpening the blade to slash my own throat
Loading the gun to blow my head off

Twisted faces in (my dream)
Screaming out their (hatred)
Ill-being (inside me)
Will they never leave me be

Gloomy figures in (my mind)
Crying out their (despair)
These parasites in (my head)
Will never set me free

Peeling my own skin, looking inside, Deep Inside
Searching for something, that lies inside
Deep Inside, in my mind
Pale faces in disguise, told the lies, in my mind
Warned me about that day, which would arrive in time

The demons so deep
Destined to be

Lost, Hollow
Empty shell, no tale to tell
To follow
Destined to be

Lost, Hollow
Tied down under a spell
To follow
In silent denial

A level of different lowness
To never see to be caught in the unreal

Nowhere near the fallen one
But everywhere under the sun
With nothing left behind

The grief that tightens it's grip, day by day
Loneliness it haunts me, makes me cry

Just the nights cold breeze

I fear the darkness that makes me blind

These tears are nothing without you
I'm nothing without you

Can you see my heart, broken like my life
Nothing to hold on, nothing to live for
This pain is too much for me to take
Holding on to you was like holding on to nothing

My trust for you tore me apart
I gave all for you from my heart


I fear the darkness that makes me blind
There's nothing I can feel

You've gotta give us a break, give us a break
Give us a break in Teenland now
In dreamland now, in Teenland now.

Read it out loud but to no one else
Pick your pocket a measure of time
And never leave these memories behind

You'll sing 'til tomorrow
And the days that will follow
But it's never the same
When you feel you're insane
On the bed where you lay
There's a plan that was made
But it's never the same
When your hopes go astray

Just write a memo, and hang it on your wall
A small reminder, of why you're here at all
So look around, and groove to the sound
Let's see those feet rise up from the ground

You'll sing 'til tomorrow
And the days that will follow
But it's never the same
When you feel you're insane
On the bed where you lay
There's a plan that was made
But it's never the same
When your hopes go astray

Now the princess washes dishes
She's done more harm than any good
I am a witness of hugs and kisses
Loneliness is never understood

So paint a picture of things that aren't real
Remember shame when it's time to kneel
And don't forget the things that you say
Could all come back to you some other day

You'll sing 'til tomorrow
And the days that will follow

Northern Pikes,"Everything I had is gone and all I cared is dead
There's nothing to lean on, there's nothing to hold on
Now all is said and done left behind like a dream
There's nowhere to go nowhere to go to

I thought I had it all...
I thought I had it all...
I thought I had it all...
I thought I had it all...

You took it all, all away, left me there, there to stay
Feeling so cold now I'm on my own now
Why should I live my life anymore
You are gone and I lost it all
There's nothing to lean on, nothing to hold on

You were everything in my heart,
And my heart still beats, these empty beats
You were everything in my heart,
And my heart will go on, without you

Still I have to carry on, carry on and on
There's nowhere to go to, nowhere to go to
I'll hope this pain will fade away, fade away some day
There's nothing to live for, there's nothing to die for

I thought I had it all...
I thought I had it all...

And my heart still beats, these empty beats
You were everything in my heart,

Thorn filled pillows on feather beds

Diamond rings stained with red-rose blood
Sing your songs about valentine mournings
Take my hand and we'll
Dream away, my love knows no boundaries
Dream away
Shine your light
Can't see too good at night
But I know
I know where they come from
Where they go
All you still unborn hide your pretty faces
Mother's dirty nails don't care about you
Comatose in your private nightmare and
You're not far but one

I want to the party
Just me, a lonely MC
You can pop the cork,
Said you can twist the cap
I'm at this party
And I'm here to rap!

I went to the party, but I couldn't get in
I asked the bouncer if he knew my girl Hesta Prynn
He said, ""I know that girl, are you in that band?""
I said, ""I think I'm on the list, could you stamp my hand?""

He said, ""Step inside girl, you look alright
Hold up - do you satisfy the minimum height?
You gotta be this tall to ride tonight""
I said, ""I might be short, but I can still party
I can shake it on the floor like Melissa Alardi!""

I went to the party, but I'll never go back, yo
The speakers were shitty and the jams were whack
This girl at the bar said, ""Northern who?""
I said, ""It's Northern State, haven't you heard of my crew?

Yo we rock the stage anyway we want,
Hell I'll rock this party like a debutante
Riverdale's too Kiwanis
True party people want us, yo
Keep it real, I gotta break the seal

And then I'm at the party and I'm fillin out (im at the party and i)
And then I'm watchin my worries as they floatin by (watch all my worries just)
It's just, there they go, slippin away now (slip away)

All the way from Avenue D
Lookin for Katie Cassidy
I noticed this guy was starin at me

He said, ""Hi,"" I said, ""Hi, do I know you?""
He said, ""Yeah, don't you run in that girl rap group?""
Uh huh ho, you're the one with that liberal arts
Academic, literary kinda name, right?

I said, ""Like Gorgeous George, my name is Hideous Hesta
Rhyme with pizazz, and I am the masta
Shout out to Cynthia plasta casta
Speed up the tempo and I'll go faster!""

Uhn! You wanna know what it's about?
I like to party but I never go out
Mailin' and I'm maxin', callin' and I'm faxin'
I need some more relaxin', 'cause my job is real taxin'!

Y'all out on the floor, relax and unwind
And the people at the party be the NSP

",At the Party
Northern State,"I've got a thousand words that I never spoke,
See I broke down codes at an early age,
Filled the page, filled my ears with rage,
Sound in my headphones sound like a cyclone,
I'm all fed up with your list of demands,
You're dreaming of the things that you're holding in your hands,
I keep my head low, I stay in the know,
I break down the door with the renegade flow,
Professor Plum with the candlestick in the conservatory,
Dr. Prynn mixes rhymes in the underwater laboratory,
You know I flow I don't drink joe coming every Friday night I know the hottest place to go
, I'm lean I'm mean I'm clean I'm not seventeen,
I'm the hottest girl rapper that you know you ever seen,
Northern States it's a new beginning, gonna throw the first pitch top of the first inning,
Coming from the island where the sun is shining,
The flow is smooth like a vinyl lining,
It's like dumb de dumb I keep my eyes underground,
I'm walking down the street I'm the purveyor of sound,
It's like dumb de dumb de dee 1,2,3,
I'm speaking loud and clear so you can understand me,
The things I do so easily,
It's like dumb de dumb de dee 1, 2, 3,
Where you at? Over here.
In a new place with the same old face you're recognizing me from the CD case,
Cause I'm 5'4 and I've got brown eyes,
Long brown hair and I'm medium sized,
You thought you knew me before, you thought you knew me when,
But now I've got the strength of a million men,
We bring the optimism and the opportunity,
You can feel the power of the possibility,
If you could see half the shit I see,
You see I caught the disease on the 1,2,3,
Beats passing through my system faster than I can spit it,
If you don't feel my style then you're not down with it,
I'm a saint not a sinner I am the prize winner,
Gonna get the NSP and host my own spaghetti dinner,
I'm a vegetarian, humanitarian, imaginarian, not a libertarian,
The country's getting ugly and there's more in store,
But don't blame me cause I voted for Gore,
Keep choice legal, your wardrobe regal,
Chekhov wrote the Seagull, and Snoopy is a beagle,
It's like dumb de dumb I keep my eyes underground,
I'm walking down the street I'm the purveyor of sound,
It's like dumb de dumb de dee 1,2,3,
I'm speaking loud and clear so you can understand me,
The things I do so easily,
It's like dumb de dumb de dee 1, 2, 3,
Where you at? Over here.
I'm running off my mouth, my engine running clean,
I'm running til I'm raw like I'm running down a dream,
I'm running out of beans, I'm running out the door,
I'm running round in circles cause I always want more,
Where you at?



",A Thousand Words
Northern State,"It's hard to be a girl these days;
I'll tell you all the reasons.
Girl gotta look good in every season.
Just ask yourself this, girl, who are you pleasin',
Starin' in the mirror, squeezin' and tweezin'?
If I could turn back the hands of time
And have a dime for all the hateful thoughts in my mind,
Like ""I can't do this"" and ""I can't wear that""
""Are my hips too big?"" ""Does my ass look fat?""
Might as well be superman, not a supermodel.
There ain't nothing you could buy in a fancy bottle
That'll ever let you love your own reflection.
Girl, close that magazine with your introspection.
'Cause you could feel good winter, spring, and fall
And when summer time comes, you gonna have it all.

I'll be your girl for all seasons.
I'll be your girl for all reasons,
Fulfilling all of your needs and
I'll be your girl for all pleasin'.

All the four seasons,
All of your needs, and
Stay with your man for all the wrong reasons.
All of your screamin', all of your demons.
Not enough time in the world for my healin'.

Girl, it's a setup and you're meant to fail.
You'd be better off on a live third rail
Just a few pass the skin test;
They don't care about the rest.
And yo, they mix lies into the cement.
We drink poison water and spend 'til we're spent
But youth it fades, crumbles, and ferments.
Eyelash curl, this is the first world
But vanity don't look good on the girl.
Oh, no, so when they line us up for roll call,
Let me make it clear on which side I fall.
'cause I'm a full grown woman, once a gifted child
And this is Northern State, not Girls Gone Wild!

I'll be your girl for all seasons.
I'll be your girl for all reasons,
Fulfilling all of your needs and
I'll be your girl for all pleasin'.

All the four seasons,
All of your needs, and
Stay with your man for all the wrong reasons.
All of your screamin', all of your demons.
Not enough time in the world for my healin'.

We can try and we can fall and we can fight to make it better.
We can try and we can fall and we can fight to make it better.
We can try and we can fall

I'll be your girl for all seasons.
I'll be your girl for all reasons,
Fulfilling all of your needs and
I'll be your girl for all pleasin'.

All the four seasons,
All of your needs, and
Stay with your man for all the wrong reasons.
All of your screamin', all of your demons.
Not enough time in the world for my healin'.

Clean up your mess and tired of stressin'.
Life and regrets and seeing you less.
I think I can leave by the end of the year.

In the Hotel California and they're turning down the beds
And I came to spread love to the west coast heads
Love letters to Brooklyn from the Hollywood Hills
No frills, a thrill seeker seeking real cheap thrills
Like rain crying into a reservoir
Come out, come out wherever you are
I said come out, come out wherever you are
To all the MC's/to the gay MC's (but they grow orange trees in LA)
To the hearts of gold

No time to sleep
I'm writing rhymes and you're counting sheep
From the east coast to the west coast
There is always one ghost-hiding in your dreams and lurking unbeknowst
Asking what are you afraid of-why you have the chills?
Said we rock the bottom of the valleys to the top of the hills
Now you're paying close attenion to all of our verses
Said you're learning all the words and counting all of the curses
And I don't know where I'mm going cause I can't seem to see
Beyond tomorrow through the haze, through the cloouds how it'll be
And the past is nothing but a memory to me

With the style I bring you-the style I bring you

Towering and cowering and tumbling and falling
My telephone keeps ringing but I said to stop calling me
My head is filled with cotton, now it's soaked up in the years
And it's soaked in the tears and the fears and the beers
Everyday I be rotting up in urban decay
You know I'm headed to the Betty said this girl in the worst way
Insanity and vanity, I'm giving into sin I said
""Oh the humanity"" and pass another valium
And Muggs not drugs-hugs and french kisses
I'm that crasy bitch who flips all of the switches
Oh boy-listen to me When I say hop that plane
'cause you've got nothing to lose
And everything, everything, eveerything to gain

We are the Gods, who have lost ourselves in forms,

I have felt the burden of pain
For the last time
So you want the fucking truth?
So you want the fucking truth?
The truth is we all suffer
We all suffer in life
We all suffer in time
Beat me down, beat me down
Again and again, again and again
Let it Reign hell on me
In life we all suffer
But I will find my way
Through the darkness

We have been patient for long enough
It is our chance, our time
Our time to rise the fuck up
I will break the wind
This road, it leads so far away from home
I breathe the air, down a road to nowhere

I feel the kiss of the breeze against my face
We long to feel the air
Around us

I'm leaving here
Don't know when I'm coming back
Close your eyes and I disappear
Floating free throughout this life
Reshaping my thoughts time does wither the mind
Time does wither the mind and in due time
The life I thought I wanted I never seem to find
It might be dark and it might be cold

I just breathe and remember where I am, inside the dream

On the feast of Stephen,
When the snow lay round about,
Deep and crisp and even.
Brightly shown the moon that night,
Though the frost was cruel,
When a poor man came in sight,
Gathering winter fuel.

Hither, page, and stand by me.
If thou know it telling:
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling? 
Sire, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain,
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes fountain.

Bring me flesh, and bring me wine.
Bring me pine logs hither.
Thou and I will see him dine
When we bear the thither. 
Page and monarch, forth they went,
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather.

Sire, the night is darker now,
And the wind blows stronger.
Fails my heart, I know not how.
I can go no longer. 
Ark my footsteps my good page,
Tread thou in them boldly:
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

In his master's step he trod,
Where the snow lay dented.
Heat was in the very sod
Which the saint had printed.

Wealth or rank possessing,

Shall yourselves find blessing",Good King Wenceslas

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

",The Escape
Nostradameus,"[Narrator:]
In the royal court there was an evil man, telling prophecies
He was the advisor to the naive king who was poisoned with his lies
Ruler of (the) kingdom was really this man, making future plans
Infecting the king with his sweet sounding voice, but heart as cold as ice

Evil prophecies- Always fooling the king
Evil prophecies- Breething chaos and war
Evil prophecies- He invents them himself
Evil prophecies- To destroy the fine land in our hearts

[Hister:]
I am a wizard
I have thousand names, call me what you want
The people who think I'm a prophet of peace are calling me Hister
I will now agitate to anarchy, into civil war
To destroy the kingdom is my one great will, this will be for real

We're marching on towards the palace, soon it is in sight

Does the evil prophet knows that we're coming, will he be prepared to die
Has he understand the signs that's written in the sky

The prophet of evil is standing proud and tall until the end of time
The prophet of evil he doesn't know the time is running out for him, I curse his soul

What is this, an ambush, it's a smaller unit enemies
It seems to me we are expected, I wonder how he was able to see...

Hundreds of them, thousands of them, behind them there I see:

Darkens my senses, tearing my soul

Don't want to be like him now
I must fight before it's too late

He walks to the kitchen unseen by all
The kings food is waiting,
It's not what it seems

Soon it will steal the good king's life.
Murder !

Soon it will be solved, the problems I have
Get rid of the fool king who sits on his ass
The prince he means trouble, must take care of that
Maybe I'll frame him for murdering the king
When my lethal poison has taken his life
I'll place some leftovers for someone to find
I'll place it with great care in the young prince's room
When somebody finds it, the prince will be doomed

Or will darkness rule the kingdom, for all eternity

Goddamn you, young prince, I will avenge

Quiero tenerte
Me hare falta una eternidad
Un día no es suficiente para devorarte
Nena quédate un ratito más
No me importa lo que digan, lo que comenten
Si yo todo te lo puedo dar

Sé que tú lo vas a disfrutar
Quiero tener un poco mas de ti, bailando suavecito
Un poco mas de ti, quédate conmigo
Un poco más de ti, yo te necesito
Un poco mas de ti
Cuando veo tu lindo cuerpo ,me pones enfermo
Solo tus besos me pueden sanar
Una debilidad me arropa cuando tú me rozas
Nena yo no me puedo controlar
No hay nada que lamentar, pégate al momento
Yo le pondré fin a tu soledad

Take it as a loss
You'll regret, the very thing
When you just up and left
You can act you're better off

Nobody cared if he lived or died and I just didn't understand
So I washed my face in the morning dew bathed my soul in the sun
Washed my face in the morning dew and kept on moving along

The second strange town I was ever in they were laughing at a poor crippled man
Begging for nickels and dimes on the street and I just didn't understand
So I washed my face

The third strange town I was ever in seemed settled peaceful and nice
The rich got richer and the poor got poorer and to me that didn't seem right
So I washed my face

Someday times are bound to change it can't be very far

Nothing More,"When you opened your eyes on the world for the first time as a child; 
How brilliant the colors were; 
What a jewel the sun was; what marvel the stars; 
How incredibly alive the trees were 
And to love again and again, 
And have people to whom we are deeply attached go to sleep and never wake up
And the laughter echoes only in one's mind... but then the echo goes
The memory, the traces are all gone
 
All your efforts, all your achievements, 
All your attainments turning into dust, nothingness
What is the feeling? what happens to you?
 
The idea of God as the potter, the architect of the universe, 
It makes you feel that life is, after all, important, 
That there is someone who cares. 
It has meaning, it has sense, and you are valuable in the eyes of the father 
But after a while it got embarrassing, the superstition, the myth, 
The absolutely unfounded idea why does anybody believe that?
 
So you become an atheist, and then you feel terrible 
After that because you got rid of God
But that means you got rid of yourself, you're just nothing but a machine
And your idea that you're a machine is just a machine too (a machine in the system)
 
So if you think that that's the way things are, you feel hostile to the world. 
You feel that the world is a neurological trap into which you somehow got caught trapped  You run from the maternity ward to the crematorium and that's it that's it
So if you're a smart kid you commit suicide
 
Now I want to propose another idea all together 
The real you, is not a puppet which life pushes around. 
The real you, the real deep down you, is the whole universe. 
You cannot confine yourself to what happens inside the skin. 
Your skin doesn't separate you from the world, it's a bridge. 
But just as a magnet polarizes its-self in north and south but its all one magnet, 
So experience polarizes itself as ""Self"" and ""Other"", but it's all one.

What you call the ""External world"" is as much you as your own body
Most people think that when they open they're eyes 
And look around that what they are seeing is outside
It seems, doesn't it, that you are behind your eyes
We haven't realized that life and death, black and white, 
Good and evil, being and non-being, come from the same center
 
When you look for your own particularized center of being 
Which is separate from everything else, you won't be able to find it
The only way you'll know it isn't there is if you look hard enough, 
To find out that it isn't there
It isn't there at all, there isn't a separate you
There are, in physical reality, no such things as separate events
 
People can't be talked out of illusions 
If a person believes that the earth is flat, 
You can't talk him out of that, he knows that it's flat 
He'll go down to the window and see that its obvious, it looks flat 
So the only way to convince him that it isn't is to say, 
""Well let's go and find the edge"".",Pyre

Bitter blood builds our prison cell
Darker water now fills our lungs
The depths of our heart have blacked the sun

Sadist
Feels good
Life can't hurt on TV
Godspeed
Lucky now
When he grabs your hand
Do you lick again
But the taste has changed
Flesh remains

See what you go through
With bleeding eyes
Got what you came for
When hate is blind

Your told me not to lie

Anger persists to drown
Love it
Loathes you
Say your knife just won't kill
Try hard
Want it now
When the taste has changed
Do you rest your face
No eyes will close
The hole grows

See what you go through
With bleeding eyes
Got what you came for
When hate is blind

You told me not to lie

Has nothing changed

Nothingface,"I tried to tell you
There's something dead in me
Love lies in moments
Still I cannot grasp one fragment
I can tell you nothing
Answers don't exist
Floors, walls my own asylum
Shades my eyes from all of this

And I kill the one that you loved
Soiled, shaded
But the knife will cut the same skin
Now I still grasp my heart
I can't graze the sadness surface
I'm so tired

I tried to feel it
Guilt wouldn't come to me
Blood soiled pillows
Sheets writhing in agony
I tried to make you feel it
You just wouldn't heal
Skin cold ends the nightmare
Sun seems brighter than before

And I kill the one you loved
Soiled, shaded
But the knife will cut the same skin
Now I still grasp my heart
I can't graze the sadness surface
I'm so tired

Talk shit
It seems to go with you fine
Living up to it when I lie
Can't stand to stare with these dead
Eyes
Turning in the badge cause you can't
Sell the image
Living with another god
He'll tell you he's mine
So you know I don't like you
Still I think you're the best

You can't find the day
So when should I take the bare
Beatings
When I'm alone
See if I can find it
Take it away all the pain cause I'm
Sorry
Can't feel any worse but I'm sure I will
Seems like no one cares but it's all
Right
Find another way

Cry beside her
Pushed away
Once too often
Face that lie
Vision changes
Shade is ice
The words are poison

Changes made now why can't I
Fill the face in the mirror
What I want still you won't give
But I cannot hate you

Oh, you're a monster

Blood alone
Stains the sorry
Tired eyes
My skin seems heavy
Mind astray
The sane still laughing
Images
All worth losing

Changes made now can't I
Fill the face in the mirror
What I want still you won't give
But I cannot hate you

Oh, you're a monster. you don't know
The hate I have
Inside, if you could see it you'd be
Terrified, you would
Kill me at once. but even by killing
Me you can't free
Yourself from my hatred. you can
Kill my body
But I'll never leave you in peace

You cannot believe what your in for
The screams burn your eyes
The feeling of leaving yourself dies
Scratch out the real you
Time ticking away the killing
Choking on sorrow

Now you're dead and didn't listen
Gave into the fear

I'm not the one who takes from you

All the reasons for losing your mind

I'd walk and pretend it's a lie

No falling concrete takers

Nouvelle Vague,"Can you hear them 
They talk about us 
Telling lies 
Well that's no surprise 

Can you see them 
See right through them 
They have no shield 
No secrets to reveal

In the jealous games people play 
Our lips are sealed  

Careless talk 
Through paper walls 
We can't stop them 
Only laugh at them 

Spreading rumors 
So far from true 
Dragged up from the underworld 
Just like some precious pearl 

It doesn't matter what they say 
In the jealous games people play 
Our lips are sealed 
Pay no mind to what they say 
It doesn't matter anyway 
Our lips are sealed 

There's a weapon 
We must use 
In our defense

Look right through them

Nova Y Jory,"Un 5 de Julio del año 1986
Llego al mundo Bull and Raice
En un pueblo de la costa norte de la isla Corl Carolina
El chamaquito conoció el lado oscuro de la isla
Viendo como los panas se mataban en el cacerio por kilo o por libra
A veces solo por poder o por guía
Y una noche sintió una música en el huesos
Y en su sistema sanguíneo
Y el chamaquito entonces tubo esta misión
Vivir de la música brother no es imposible
Cuando de la música es que deseas vivir

Any solo dream ya vivo en el siglo 25
Mami sin dinero, papi no es precinto
Y yo me acuerdo en las noches me pasaba pensando
Algún día seré rico o moriré tratando

Pero ahora todo es diferente
Ahora le gusto a la gente
El que estaba pichando
(Lo digo mamando)
Su carrera esta en peligro
(Lo digo mamando)

Ahora no hay break
Seguiré matando hasta que yo lo decida
Mataré a to el que siga envidiando

Ahora no hay break
Me importa to correr lo que la gente diga
No me voy a quitar (Mientras siga respirando)

Tienen que aceptar la realidad
Que acabo de arrancar y no voy a parar
Y aunque hay un centenar que me quieran ver mal
Yo no voy a parar, no

Y hay que aceptar la realidad
Que acabo de arrancar y no voy a parar
Y aunque hay un centenar que me quieran ver mal
Yo no voy a parar, no

Ahora no hay break
Seguiré matando hasta que yo lo decida
Mataré a to el que siga envidiando

Ahora no hay break
Me importa to correr lo que la gente diga
No me voy a quitar (Mientras siga respirando)

Un 3 de Octubre de 1980 llego al mundo en el seno de una familia humilde
El chamaquito fue criado por una madre soltera
El chamaquito jamas permitió que eso se convirtiera en una dificultad papi
El chamaquito agarro lo mejor que pudo de la experiencia
Y con la música como norte
El chamaquito comprendió si misión en la vida
Que la vida a veces esta llena de depresiones tropicales
Y que never stop five and the level
Y dios no the raith papi
Ahhh

Jaja
Cuando empece en esta cuestión fue sin mirar atrás
Sin saber que el camino es duro pero hay que luchar
Con un entendimiento y mientras canto pasa el tiempo
Veo como mi carrera gira, oh que bien me siento
Ahora se, que lo que cultive ha rendido frutos
En absoluto no fue en vano como lo disfruto
Y solo es el comienzo (Colega me escuchas)
'Toy viajando el mundo entero, intenciones tengo muchas
Muchas puertas que toque, mil estudios visite
Sentía que me quitaba, pero nunca me quite
Y aquí estamos, dos seres humanos que se juntan
Dejando de que hablar, hay muchas preguntas
Gracias al señor por la fuerza que me diste
La madre que me pusiste, la familia y lo que hiciste
Contesto sus preguntas con la dura realidad

O si guardas una llave para mi
Solo se que el amor tiene la manera

Para hacerte la dueña
De todo mi corazón

No se si la vida mi complazca con tenerte
O si para ella es mucho pedir
Solo se que no me conformo con verte

Yo quiero un beso tuyo
No se si la vida nos lleve a otro continente
Y caminando por las calles de parís
Te detengas y me digas de repente
Yo quiero un beso tuyo
Solo un besito tuyo

Siempre cerca de mi corazón

Para nunca echarte de menos
Que no haría yo

Si yo te tuviera tu eres la mujer mas feliz
Tengo un mundo de amor completo para ti
Que podamos compartir la noche bajo la luna
Eres la única testigo de tanta dulsura

Y te enamoraría que no te daría
Por que seas mía viajar conmigo te llevaría
Yo quisiera que sea la reina de mi hogar
Tanto amor pa;' regalar no lo puedes despreciar

Si quieres ponme pruebas
Para yo demostrarte que haría
Todo por mi amor
Por que mas que pienso no logro imaginarme
Algo que no haría por ti…

Y que no haría yo para tenerte
Siempre cerca de mi corazón

Chulería es to' lo que le doy y me pide mas a lo rudo
Y sin fronteo se me pega y me hace un nudo
Caliente me sube a la cama cama, metele duro con ganas ganas
Y lo hacemos como tu quieras distinto a lo mio mami deja el drama
Le meto con fuerza y en reversa se coloca
Se toca, me da una mirada escandalosa
Yo no me quito, le quito el vestido y la azoto
Sin duda, se desnuda cuando le entra la locura
Y quiere sexo, le doy en exceso
Vamos al proceso, no hay besos, te noto travieso
Yo no me quito, le quito el vestido y la azoto
Le gusta el alboroto, so nos fuimos a lo loco

Postura por to' lados, algo impresionante
Imaginatela lo que le inflama
La prendo en llamas, castigo castigo y se derrama

Que no te buscara, que sin mi bien vivirías
Siente la amargura noche fría sin ternura
Sin que te acaricie, sin tener más aventuras

Dale pasa, por las cosas que ya yo pasé
Y ahora siente el rechazo y ganas de querer volver
Ni me llames, olvídate de todos los recuerdos
De las cosas que vivimos juntos no quiero lamentos
Te digo adiós, lo mejor es seguir solo

NovaZanz,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no

In spirit, body, and mind
Forever cold to faith in life
Mother of night, embrace me
I have not forgotten
Looking back on the years of last
With so much pain to bare
I am broken

Nights forgotten its son of brave
And turned her back on bitterness
Torn is my duality
Judging the force of things yet old
Trivia in forsaken thoughts
Of tomorrow's crushing blow

A calming plea, follow the day

Two fold, I stand to ache
Given to me by pitiful life
Desperate time, to pass in stride
How does anyone ever know?
False dreams, and lesser faith

Can you look me in the eyes
And tell me everything's all right?
If we talk about tomorrow
How can I stop your tears?

Separation of life and mind
Comfort, the quest for time
Suffer day, and hallowed night
In dark realms to betray
Left here for the devouring dogs
To feast upon my very pride

How I live my life is far from normal days
See my downward fall, and allow me to lie

I give into my life, and color it with black
I listen to my heart, and hear nothing
If every day is cold, and the skies have turned to gray
Only then will I be happy with this pain

These are the rules set forth, to be lost in a day

Novembre,"Slowly gliding down through the bottle that seems to have no end
Sweet is the falling in those bubbles and colors
When you leave nothing you care about behind
When the state of mind is drowning and all the world is drunk
The reads I walk are even sadder than ever
Every word has a reason and every line has a rhyme
All the things which used to be dark are suddenly clear
All that broken glass on my hand to spill all the inferno I feel
All the thorns of my crown to fill you with the blood you deserve
All the tears I mixed with wine are tastier than your fading lips
And the mud in which I crawled is warmer than your melting kiss
And the lights that other eyes brought to me couldn't light

War only was
To bond us all

Hell no, no war can paint this more sore

And bags of coal from some monstrous soul
And no, no rain can clean this at all

You say, ""there's no way-out at all"", is something false
But way-out, if it is not far is still getting narrow

The prayers for light result in failure and dismay
But almost yawn, it's a Deja Vu sounding horror

Someday I'll take you by the hand
And leave this place without a face

Don't ever want to miss a moment
As we've just begun something
I just wanna be someone
That makes you believe you are not breaking away

And I wonder what on Earth are we awaiting
For the train to tomorrow is here and it is longing
To take us away

And tomorrow there'll be landscapes you just dreamt about
And the sound of the bells
Will sound much realer in this brand-new dawn
Yes tomorrow there'll be still shades of yesterday
But they'll get vaguer and vaguer
As the winter's caress approaches close

I run to you
And I see the sky crying
Crying tears of widow, tears soon wiped dry
And thousand windows look at us dance
This sweet'n'sour theme, a romance
Dance, dance, dance...

Engulf me in your soul
And let those feathered arms fly.",Croma

Sull'onda di un brutto sogno
CapÃ¬ che era giunto il momento d'andare

Ã? molto che non voliamo""
E cosÃ¬ prese due stracci e salpÃ² per il mare

Quel giorno il mare era un quadro
Di colori scuri, disse
""Guarda un po chi see'Ã¨! Mi sei mancato compare!""

Non saprei dirvi il perchÃ¨
Di questa storia che ha messo
Amore e dolore
In una sacca sgualcita

Capisci, il tempo del gioco
Ã? oggi l'era del vuoto
E poi son solo preghiere da porgersi al mare

Sound the chime
Sound the chime
Like a sign from high, up high

Yeah, it seems like rain
But no, it won't hurt us again
And the whole landscape is mine
Oh friend of mine, of mine

All alone in this peak of a time
You can only hear this one voice
Tell him what you desire
And it's going to happen...

Quando domani tornerai

You were alone that day
Behind the screaming crowd, that day
And the rain started falling down
To soothe the thirst for slaughterings

And tomorrow other thunderstorms will come
From east as usual
Then we'll enjoy them with a smile

You were alone that day
Behind the screaming crowd, that day

Novembre,"Sometimes the night
Brings memories, sometimes the night
Brings feelings you thought they are dead
In some dusty, forgotten lost hall of your mind yes, sometimes
The night

This time a sea of ox-eyes
Painting the irises of white
Flooding mi senses with light
Filling my forgotten halls with bright

Because the lanes of the night
Always lead to railways blind
Always lead to the most pointless rhymes
Rhymes of life that sometimes we must write
Take the hand that is given to you
Let yourself to this Sunday morning

We're riding this shore to someplace beyond
So don't ever believe we'd stop by

Where many different pathways meet
And we're standing on this precipice
With nothing much to gain save
But the deep blue screams
Of falling dreams
With our next move

Heaven hide your eyes
Heaven's eyes will never dry

The shades of a thousand steel
Come flashing by my face
In the fury of war
In desolation and abandoned fields
The hungry make their stand
When they'll stand for no more
Hear the passion in their voices
See the heaven in their eyes
Their hopes and schemes are waiting
Dreams of less than paradise
And sometimes we make promises
We never mean to keep
For blackmail is the only deal
A promise dealer sees

Heaven hide your eyes
Heaven's eyes will never dry",The Promise
Novembre,"Upon the rivers of the day
It blows a cool breeze in the air
Of thoughts and shimmering hours of May
And all its feelings

I dared to walk down by the lane
Calm and fearless in the rain
I felt that you were by my side
Calm and tender

You are the reason for this May
Has washed the purple clouds away

You are the reason for this May
Has washed the purple clouds away

You are the reason for this May

Listen, all the time we witness miracles,
All the time!

We thought that anyone that has a life
Bear the cross of the passion and of the time
Oh, the way I was blind!

The time I stumbled over your blue eyes
I felt like falling into a pool of joy
And a sort of miracle happened
The ancient fortress vanished at your smile

Has blown all darkness far away
You are the reason for this May

Is gone lost out of sight

E niente potrà mai cambiare

Di questo rimase il rumore
D'un sogno che come nel mare
Si infrange su nere scogliere
D'un nero che può cancellare

È far si che il proprio domani
Sia senza calar del Sole

Spogliati dalla lor ragione

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

And through foggy London town,

Everybody looking through me

Nox Aurea,"Since I once heard the enticing call
From the depth of the most secret core, 
The very rebellious lust of triumph
Burns wild in my black longing heart

And now as it enchants me again, 
Stronger and clearer than ever before
I run in ecstasy towards the utmost edge
Disregarding any border, striving beyond

I saddle the maelstrom of a burning Charybdis
Without an ounce of fear, nor stumbling or doubt
For no chains of profane can ever prevent me
Even though my world's foundation tremble

Nor even Death... 

As I once left the pity fellowship of man
And my liberation shook their conception, 
They scorned and feared the essence of my quest
Since it made them question their deceitful reasons

Yet their taunts and attempts to enslave me again
Were all in vain, for Lucifer himself shines within me
""The higher we soar, the smaller we appear
To those who cannot fly"" 

Driven by an urge to experience the concealed
And now I shalt conquer God's throne itself
Through aeons I have travelled, floating through tunnels
For nothing I seek but the gold of divine
No chains of profane can ever prevent me
Even though my world's foundation tremble

For it is Death herself who sweeps the landscape, 
Embracing a lost world in shades and vapour

I will never forget the dread of November, 
Her grievance and stillness of lonely nights
The desire of heart, in minor adorned, 
Dancing so gently as dim northern lights

How I do love this pleasant seclusion,

Close your eyes and drift off to sleep
Nothing more to say
You'll be on your way to a dream
Follow a moonbeam
They glow through the night
Sleepy sleep tight
Everything's wonderful, sleep

Time to lay me down
Everyone is falling asleep
No one here but us
Cuddle up and just drift away
Over the rooftop or float out to sea
Wherever you go
Everything's wonderful, sleep

Can't describe the feeling
To sleep through the night
Rest is oh, so healing
So healing, ah
Sleep through the night
Sleepy sleep tight
Everything's wonderful, sleep

With hair down to here, and plenty of money,

And then you know you'd better make up your mind.
And pick up on one and leave the other behind.

Sometimes you really dig a girl the moment you kiss her,
And then you get distracted by her older sister.
When in walks her father and takes you in line,
And says, ""Better go on home, son, and make up your mind.""

And then you bet you'd better finally decide.
And say yes to one and let the other one ride.

How the music can free her, whenever it starts
And it's magic, if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bout rock and roll

If you believe in magic don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen it'll start with a smile
It won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping and you can't seem to find
How you got there, so just blow your mind

If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until morning 'till there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see

A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

Describing morons narrow minds and loser bloody frozen hearts
People who can't see past skin or see what's in a good mans heart
Closed up thinking backwards mind all thought paralyzed
Using any argument cause you don't want to use your head
Keeping evil ways alive even though they should have died
Freedom is a human right,
Doesn't matter
Black or White.
Equal Rights, Human Rights
Martin Luther a great man who people to be sane
Killed by frightened ignorance even though it was too late
His message seems to be quite clear, why should we be ruled by fear
With his death a great man died but you can't kill his ideals
Let us leave behind us all these stupid racial arguments
Help make racial wars a distant unforgotten memory
Maybe hate will never die, that doesn't mean we shouldn't try...

It's also a sin to use protection

But she does the best that she can.
'Cause she's a good-hearted woman;
She loves her good-timin' man.

In love with a good-timin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways

A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.

Maybe tomorrow the sun won't shine
What do I do if it starts to rain
What do I do about this pain
Out in the dark and I'm by myself
Winter is planning a big farewell
I dream of a time when I touched the sky
I severed a wing and I cannot fly

Sunday I ruled my life, made my plans
Made my own solutions
Sunday night fate arrived
Life has regarded me as pollution

Hard to find a friend
I need some company
I'm scared of the dark
The dark is scared of me

I'm scared of the dark and I'm by myself

I dream of a time when I touched the sky
I dream of a time in a former life
I severed a wing and I cannot fly
Maybe tomorrow the sun won't shine

What do I do about this pain

Maybe life itself, or could it be love
Or God with a gentle shove

I fear what I know not what I wonder
All the weight of the world on my back finally kills me, but I know that it won't ever take me

So take your money right back to the hell it came
Don't wait and don't worry
I won't be standing in your way
So to hell with your money before you suffer the same fate

Perfect from afar
Though it's shape may be its visitors are flawed
They take and still want more

Assuring you once again I'm there
'Cause you break my trust,
You break my heart
I'll break your fall

So I lied
Don't say you've done the same
Without a smile upon your face
'Cause once you've but tasted
Of this fruit that lay,
A serpent swayed your ways
Which brings me to my next thought
Walk these roads as crooked as they be
So I lied, and so we lie

Can you feel the tension in the air?
Assuring you once again I'm there
'Cause you break my trust,
You break my heart
I'll break your fall

So I lied,
This time I face the sky without a smile,
Without a trace
And I don't just see blue I choose to
With still no sign of you
Which brings me to my next thought
Don't be fooled by the cunning ways of the truth
So I lied, and so we lie

Weakened knees
Belong to those who find it hard to believe
But so intrigued
By the thought of someone,
Somehow, meeting their needs
By the thought of someone,
Somewhere, meeting our needs

Assuring you one again I'm there
You break my trust,
You break my heart
I break your fall
You fall, your fall

Yo tengo celos de la luna
porque tus ojos de aceituna me los han robao
y voy notando como va menguando lo que sientes tu por mi

Yo tengo celos de la noche
que cuando llega me la esconde y no se adonde va
y es que no vivo solo de pensar 
donde irán aquellos besos que se acaban
aquella luz que ayer brillaba en tu mirada
¡Ay dime tu donde se irán!

Llorando con los ojitos bien cerrados
que me has robao el corazón

Que vuelo que vuelo hasta el cielo 
me hiere tu ausencia, me hiere estar sola

Me queda dentro la esperanza
de que me sientas y me abraces como aquella vez
que prometimos darnos todo, todo aquello que perdimos hoy

Solo me quedan los recuerdos
de tu sonrisa 
yo te prometo serte siempre fiel

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant

Loving one who loves you

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget

I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

English Translation: To understand this Qawwali, you need to know a little about the History of the Sufi Saints. Jhoole Lal – A saint from Sindh who as a child was always found on a swing reciting the name of God. Shahbaaz Qalander (Red Falcon) another Sufi Fakir renowned for amazing poetry in love for God. 


Mast Mast – 


Dam Mast Qalander Mast Mast – Upon My breath and in my intoxication is the great Qalander.
Dam Mast Qalander Mast Mast

Mera vird hai dam dam Ali Ali – My worship and upon my breath is the name of Ali.
Saqi Laal Qalander Mast Mast – I am intoxicated with the beloved Qalander
Jhoole Laal Qalander Mast Mast – I am intoxicated with Jhoole Laal who is intoxicated with Qalander
Aakhi Ja Malanga Akhi Ja Malanga – Keep repeating his name you follower of Ali
Tu Ali Ali Ali Akhi Ja Malanga – You Ali !!! Keep saying his name.


These lyrics mirror exactly the name of the Qawwal – to be in intoxication “Mast”.

Que vaut la vie d'un homme dans certains pays
Pas plus qu'une poignée de billets
On s'entretue pour rien ou pour presque rien tcho?
Je partirais au lever du jour
Plus rien ne me retient ici
Ils ont tué le peu d'amour
Qui restait dans cette chienne de vie
La misère qui ronge nos faubourgs
Ne fait qu'endurcir mon esprit
J'irais chercher ailleurs
Un peu d'espoir
Qui sait si la roue tourne
Demain me sourira

Je sais que partout où j'irai
Faudra payer le prix
Ici ou ailleurs tout ce que je sais
C'est qu'on est en droit de choisir
Je pars et Dieu seul sait où je vais
Sûrement loin d'ici
Je sais ce que j'y trouverais
Le meilleur, comme le pire
Je ne crois pas à la terre promise
Je ne vois pas l'horizon
Même si la tyrannie s'éternise
Je garderais toutes mes illusions
C'est tout un symbole qu'on brise
Pour s'affranchir de l'oppression
Quoi qu'il arrive
Je n'ai plus rien à perdre
C'est à la force des mains
Que je me construirais un avenir
Au refrain
Comment vivre jour après jour
Si on t'enseigne l'ignorance
Qu'il n' y a que les fusils en recours
Face à la trop grande arrogance

De voir un jour mon peuple se lever

Nuttin' But Stringz,"Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me 
And then
Spin me around 'till I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me 
And I knew for sure 
I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk
Another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love love love 
To dance with my father again

When I and my mother 
Would disagree
To get my way I would run 
From her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me
yeah yeah
Then finally make me do 
Just what my mama said
Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he 
Would be gone from me

If I could steal one final glance
One final step 
One final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
Cause I'd love love love to 
Dance with my father again

Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear how mama would cry for him
I'd pray for her even more than me
I'd pray for her even more than me

I know I'm praying for much to much
But could you send her 
The only man she loved
I know you don't do it usually
But Dear Lord
She's dying to dance with my father again

Every night I fall asleep
And this is all I ever dream",Dance with My Father

Not too sure how to act
Or even waiting for you to say I love you(i love you)
Ill kiss myself and say a prayer
And feel the point of loving when you were here

NWH,"NWH is in the house 
To tell you punk little suckers what it's all about 
When it comes to butts we are the masters 
Ain't a butt with a kitty in front gettin' past us 
But there's a part of the butt that we want to introduce 
It's nasty and wet and it's called booty juice 

[Chorus:]
That booty juice, juice, juice 
That booty juice, juice, juice 

Booty juice comes right from the source 
What's the source an ass of curse 
The kind that spreads out extra wide 
The kind that's nice when you come inside. 
It's fresh an meaty all pasturized 
But I always rise when I tap the thighs 
'Cause I like'm big , I like'm greasy 
I like'm round and I like'm easy 
I like'm when the girls steps on the floor 
Shake'n them booties just like a ho 
I like it when it shakes in the pants so loose 
But I love it when it's drippin -- that booty juice 

[Chorus]

When booty juice falls gotta go for yours 
When it's really wet you gotta mop the floor 
When I look fine fade to dance 
I make my decision by the shape of her pants 
Cause the bigger the butt, the bigger the shake 
The bigger the shake, the more it's gonna make that booty juice 
Ain't made by hand but yes it does come from a can 
Pop it open and take a sip careful not to catch you lip 
In a can is where the river runs and quench your thirst between those buns 

[Chorus]

See I like the fit with the nasty ass 
The kind that hums when the shit goes past 
Grab a cheek when the girl goes by 
Slap it hard make the booty juice fly 
Yo baby doll pull down those tight draws 
When your butt expands it'll slap the walls 
I'll grab it from front and from behind 
We'll do the nasty and do the grind 
Slip and slide all over the sheets 
Cause booty juice is just like grease 
Buck so hard that your butt gets wet 
Put that ass in full effect 
Take off those draws, take off that lace 
Have a seat on my face and let me taste 
That booty juice

NWH,"People ask why I walk this way 
Protection first is all I say 
I got it they want it 
Believe it, they'll steal it 
Some of them punks just want to feel it 
When they see me grip with both hands 
It's a black thing they don't understand 
It's true they want to take it all 
So before they rip you ball for ball 
Cup your hand and cover up 
[NWH] say grab your stuff 
[Chorus ]
Grab it, you gotta grab it 
Grab it 
Grab it, you gotta grab it 
Grab it

Four hundred years and it ain't enuff 
Suckers still tryin? to take our stuff 
Stealin it, swipin it, rippin it, bitin it 
They can't grow it so punks try to heist it

Gotta look out for the black 
When they start going for the family jewels 
Protect that gear by whatever tools 
Cup your hand and cover up

Ladies this involves you too 
Stand by the man that stands by you 
Help him, love him, need him, believe him 
Plenty of others will try to defeat him 
If your man is wit you 
Let no other make issue 
When they try to take him down 
You can keep him off the ground 
Lend a hand and lift him up

'Cause we are all one race on this planet 
We all burp and fart, and that's the way God planned it

We've all mined a rock or two I'd suppose 
The nose might be white when you reach to clean 
But red, yellow, brown or black the booger's still green 
An sometimes it's anchored to some snot 
That hangs from your nose, and you're afraid it's gonna drop 
So you catch it in your hand and hope no one realizes 
You've got mucous on your hand while your driving 
So you look for a place to try and hide it 
You open up your mouth, and there you slide it

hotter than a Mexican jumping bean 
Have em dry roasted or vacuum packed

Smoother than jiff, and fresher than planters 
my peanuts exceed all standards 
Def enough to knock you to your knees 
and even planters don't crack no nuts like these 
My peanuts! 
Well they rock they top they hit the spot 
open a can and gobble em up 
they're ready for action, the girls do snatch em 
sure to give you some satisfaction 
So let?s not squibble they sure ain't little 
Deffer than any ole peanut brittle 
An if you want to chill no need to get ill 
 my peanuts give you a thrill 
Like mickey dees my peanuts an me 
were tasty eating from sea to sea 
My peanuts! 
My nuts stand tall they never fall 
Ripe and yes always on the ball 
FDA fresh and they are the best 
A winner of every damn taste test 
Eat em for pleasure or at your leisure 
a taste that all the girls do treasure 
Never illin but chillin 
Never stealin but dealin 
my peanuts are what you're feelin 
I take em to the beach, I take em to the park 
I takem to your mothers house after dark 
They ain't like no nuts from Jimmy Carter 
I know my nuts rock you harder 
My peanuts! 
I met a home girl from around the way 
she saw my peanuts and wanted to play 
She said can I hold your peanuts inside my hand 
I said be careful cause they're in demand 
I took my peanuts outta the sack 
her hand started movin up, down and back 
She squeezed too hard, I said oh brother 
it looks like you made peanut butter 
Next time I jam her 
I think I am a gonna talk a little bout my banana 
Banana and nuts, banana and nuts 
I'm gonna give you some banana an nuts 
Banana an nuts banana an nuts 
I think you need my banana an nuts 
Always classy, never trashy, always flashy, never rashy, always tasty, never hasty, always racy, never pasty 
You know nothin will come between us, unless of course it is- 
(What is it?)

This girl was yellin my head was swellin 
What she was sayin there ain't no tellin 
I needed something to quiet her down 
and my peanuts was all I found 
I baked em I shaked em and then she taked em 
Soon all was quiet in the house 
because my peanuts were in her mouth 
Like M&M?s you understand 
they melt in your mouth and not in your hand 
My peanuts have the fame my peanuts have the glory 
my peanuts will invade your territory 
My peanuts! 
I?ll tell ya a little story bout a man named mel 
Keep his peanuts inside the shell 
Then one day he got hungry for some food 
He ate his own peanuts now ain't that rude? 
(Dry roasted, vacuum packed, on a half shell, don't tell Granny) 
A girl who looked much better than bad 
took my peanuts from inside my bag 
Tasted them and then said I had salt peanuts, salt peanuts 
My peanuts always rise to any occasion 
My peanuts can handle any social situation 
I met a home girl from Albuquerque 
who ate my peanuts with her turkey 
I know this song is kinda long 
I guess I have ta go and I?ll be gone

They want to keep a brother buried and bald 
Don't wear a toupee cause that's assimilation 
Don't say it's okay that's oral masturbation 
Hats offer enclosure from deadly exposure 
Of sucker imposers ready to close your Coffin 
And lower you down black 
Bald buried and beaten into a pre-dug track 
That's whack- the way they dis the black 
How can a brother complain when we don't fight back? 
It ain't hate cause we retaliate 
With the gat in my hands and the hat on my pate 
See back in the day out in the fields they kept us 
Exposed to the rays, without no shields they left us 
Without a hat we wuz exposed 
Without a hat we wuz sunstroked 
The African sun was pure and good 
Never needed a hat just brotherhood 
But the good old days are a brothers worst enemy 
Tell me stay bald I say it ain't me 
Look in my eyes and you'll realize 
These ain't lies I wouldn't lead you wrong 
Get wit the facts as I chart the stats 
Cold kick the hats make the black grow strong 
Time to make the change 
Gotta cover my brain 
Start dealin' the pain 
To those who'd keep me in chains

Minha intuição me diz pra continuar
Seguir meu coração

O destino nos uniu, você já sabe
Tudo começou como se fosse amizade
Naturalmente a gente foi se envolvendo
Foi se gostando, se conhecendo
Aquela noite eu me lembro, foi fatal
Não esperava o seu beijo num luau
Uma viagem se tornou inesquecível
Eu percebi que era mais que um amigo
Todo dia eu corria pra te ver
Eu admito, apaixonado por você
Mas de repente um casal as vezes briga
Eu fico triste, pois você é minha vida
Eu quero mais te amar todo o tempo
Convivência assim, sem sofrimento
Tô cansado de ficar aqui sozinho
Amor eu tô voltando, aí é o destino

O destino me fez ir embora (seu bye bye, assim, não foi legal)
O tempo vai nos dizer quem é quem (cê foi embora, amor, nem me deu tchau)
Pode não ser o fim da nossa história
O destino me trouxe até aqui (uma paixão não termina assim)
Minha intuição me diz pra continuar (tenho certeza, não é o fim)
E seguir meu coração

Quando eu acordo você vai dormir
Você me achou e eu te perdi
Entre encontros e desencontros
Será que é isso que a vida preparou
Para nós, saiba que não vou desistir
De estar com você

O destino me fez ir embora (seu bye bye, assim, não foi legal)
O tempo vai nos dizer quem é quem (cê foi embora, amor, nem me deu tchau)
Pode não ser o fim da nossa história
O destino me trouxe até aqui (uma paixão não termina assim)
Minha intuição me diz pra continuar (tenho certeza, não é o fim)
E seguir meu coração

Final feliz! E seguir o meu coração",O Destino

Después de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete
Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a Los Diecisiete

Te esfumaste de mis brazos como se va el viento

Diciéndome que quieres regresar

Sabes que quien manda en él soy yo, yo

Sabes que soy yo, yo, quien te hace feliz

corria solta
Subia a manga

No calor alumínio
nem caneta,

quase um curral
na mochila amassada
uma quentinha abafada
meu troco é pouco (2x)
é quase nada

Pegou sua viola e tocou pro povo 
Pro povo do crime 
Que foi chegando e colocando 
As suas armas devagar no chão 
O mesmo chão que guarda o sangue 
O mesmo chão de correrias 
O mesmo chão de tantas famílias 
Que hoje batucam o mesmo som 

Na palma da mão pra aliviar 

O negro brilhou e ajudou 
Aquelas almas distorcidas pela guerra 
Só com a viola, só com a voz 
Só com a viola suas idéias 
Onegro falou e falou alto 
Inspirou uma calma 
E misteriosamente alegre é 
Sufocando o pior dos bandidos 

E em troca deixou lágrimas 
Nos olhos do artista 
Lágrimas, lágrimas 
Na palma da mão pra aliviar 

Hoje mesmo, hoje 
Quando o barulho dos tiros sinalizam 
O que acontece por lá 

Uma comunicação silenciosa 
Se faz com a memória das armas no chão 
Por algum momento 
Ganhando outra missão

Estar acima do biotipo suspeito
Mesmo que seja dentro de um carro importado

Com um salário suspeito
Endossando a impunidade à procura de respeito

Que só sabe falar
Como dá ideia se não sabe ouvir
Porque aquilo que a vida trás
Trás pro mundo, e não só pra ti
Só dê importância, a força positiva
Que te faz seguir
Nunca deixe se levar pelo desespero
Siga até o fim, siga até o fim

E quem não tem escolhas
Não sabe o que fazer
Pois se perdeu na sombra
De escolhas de um outro proceder
Bomba relógio, molecada nas ruas
Sem ler e escrever
Como um cara perdido na rua
Vivendo no mundo sem um porque

Coragem negro, frustrações, canções
Emoções, traições

De olho no lance vai, chega, avança
Driblou o zagueiro, goleiro, guerreiro a chance
Não canse, dance, lance, corra, alcance
A nuance, o advance, o romance
A corrida, querida, é bandida, vivida e sofrida
Vários pica que fica, na fita, na pista invertida
Pode pá, só pra chegar, se você quiser
E não há o que se lamentar, guerreiro de fé
Se não é o que quer, e você não era o que tem
Vai até o seu limite, busca força do além
Você não viu ninguém, você contou pra alguém?
Se não tem disposição, vitória não vem
Se montou a quadrilha, ou ta sozinho na trilha
Se abriu a biqueira, ou se lembrou da família
Se você quer o progresso, dê acesso ao amor voltar
Assuma o risco, assuma o erro no seu lugar

Um dia lindo pra uns não diz nada
E pra outros, tem tudo a dizer

E pra outros, depende do que você vê",Um Dia Lindo (Participação Especial de Edi Rock)

'Cause you sorta got me sea-sick, waving your belly
Like in and out then out and then in
Then back to out, girl drop your friends

'Cause I ain't trying to have 'em with us all night
Face looking all tight, ask if it's alright
If you just leave for a minute, come back
My mind freeze for a minute, but your waist throwback

You looking good in that teeny-weeny-mini skirt
Girl you hot as a shorty, any cherry-red lipstick
Sucking a lollipop, winding your body
Looking at me, ma' you know you need to stop

You got my hands all over you
Girl you got something, nothing I don't do
And I can see you're down to do whatever
You's a girl gone wild so now it's going down tonight

I could've sworn I seen mami on a poster
And she keeps moving closer and closer
She's a pro so I don't have to coach her

I'm digging her 'cause she handle her business
My hand on her hip, when I dip then she dip
And all the homies want to dance with her
'Cause she's hot to death, young and sexy, she loves the club

Just a minute and I promise I'mma follow your lead
And we could, two step to the bass line
Hands on your waistline, I don't understand why we waste time

'Cause you bumped and grind
And the reason why we still here, stumps my mind, mama
I see you sorta looking like you want more
So we can do the same thing with our clothes off, holla

Girl, we might as well, be crushing on the floor
Our bodies so close, your skin is so soft
Tonight I'mma slide with you, girl

Girl, do you like what you see?
Girl you know what you're doing
Turn around and dance for me

She was cold and hungry
I gave her all that I could
I was sure that she loved me
And we were thick as thieves.

Through the winter I kept her warm
Fed her all she desired
When she told me in so many words
I was the one to save her life
And she would never forget
And I would never be left.

But then one day
I ran out of bread
And wood to keep the fire
And when I woke
I found she had fled

I'm sick of one direction down
I'm a broken picture frame
My whole world twisted inside out

Screaming voices like a hurricane
Telling me to wake up, get out of bed

There's fresh air out the door

And I've been acting so pathetic
Knocking around like a ball on a string
It's taking time for me to get it
I'm ready and willing to do anything to make it up to you

My arms are hurting so bad from being so empty
My heart weighs like a ton 'cause it feels so heavy
I'm standing here all alone, wishing that I could've known
You just can't walk away from the damage

Last time, I'm playing with a broken string
It don't matter no one's listening
'Cause losing you has made me see
I've gotta change, gotta blame it all on me

My hands may as well be tied 'cause I just can't touch you

From fires I started yesterday
I know I've gotta find a way
Somehow I've gotta find a way to wake up from the damage

My eyes may as well be blind if I just can't see you
My hands may as well be tied 'cause I just can't touch you

But a playa's gotta play

Baby do that dance for me
Get your friends 'round
Two or three
We can rendezvous
And do that thing we do
I wanna drink to you

After drinks, it's time to leave
Go to valet, get my keys
Here's a fifty, keep the change
Jump in the Range

Is that a sin?
Tomorrow is her best friend

",Girl Like That
O-Town,"Ohh, ohh
Ohhh

Girl, I remember how it all began
You introduced her as your friend
But I knew I was in trouble when
I saw her smile at me
And then she asked me for a dance
But never offered you a glance
Well let me tell you girl with friends like that
Who needs enemies

[Chorus:]
Should've known better than to trust a friend
Who's jealous of the way we livin'
I don't think you know what's happening
Your girl is shading you
Should've known better than to trust a friend
Behind your back she gives me rhythm
But I'm 'bout to make her understand
I only dance with you

Girl, you say your friend is just flirting by
It's getting so ridiculous
That she's thinking she can mess with us
But I don't play around
Even when she's saying that you're unaware
And it's cool with you to share
No I still ai't gonna dance with her
I'm telling you right now

[Chorus]
Should've known better than to trust a friend
Who's jealous of the way we livin'
I don't think you know what's happening
Your girl is shading you
Should've known better than to trust a friend
Behind your back she gives me rhythm
But I'm 'bout to make her understand
I only dance with you

Don't try to say I lost the mind
I know your girl has crossed the line (cause I really know that)
She got issues, she trying to diss you
The minute that you turn around
She pulled a switch boo
Cause she's wishing what's yours was hers
So now leave the girl, that ain't never gonna work

[Chorus:]
Should've known better than to trust a friend
Who's jealous of the way we livin'
I don't think you know what's happening
Your girl is shading you
Should've known better than to trust a friend
Behind your back she gives me rhythm
But I'm 'bout to make her understand
I only dance with you

Should've known girl not to trust a friend
Should've known jealous of how we livin'
Should've known I was shading you
Only dance with you

Everything that I said
The night I left her there
When I said I wanted out
I was angry and upset
And at the time I could care less about staying there
I had to prove I didn't care
As much as she thought I did

I showed her
I let my pride take me
Far away from the only woman I loved
I showed her
And now she has found someone new
And her life will go on
And I'm all alone
But I showed her

Oh oh oh

I hate that she's in love
But it took a while for her to get over the hurt
Now I know that I messed up
I was trying to give us time
But I see she took that time to find somebody else
What happened to the things she felt for me
Am I really a part of her past

Jehovah!

And I said, what'cha looking at?
He hit me across the face with a bat
I grabbed my .45 and I said let's get out and go
So he opened the door and said
Do what you're here for

I said I'm wandering round the road four to four
And I said I been walking
For about a thousand years.
And my feet are growing tired

My eyes a little wired
Don't know what to do unless I retire
And he just said let's play some crazy poker

So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?
He looked at me with a face full of fright
And I said, how 'bout a revolution?
And he said right.
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say die
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say die dah dah
Day day oh!

I said that, was the craziest game of poker that I ever saw
I said that, was the craziest game of poker that I ever saw
But I'm not gonna quit and I'm not gonna stop
I don't give a shit cause I got the drop

Johnny just got two eyes just like mine
And I'm feeling kinda funky, kinda fine
And I drank a bottle of whiskey, 'fore I came
Came to the bar to see what's the same

I saw my man named Johnny sittin' across the table from me
And to my left was a man, he had no chin
Didn't really think about starting a scene
The man to my right wasn't feeling kinda nice

He looked kinda mad and I felt bad
Because I took his money last night it's kinda funny
But now I'm just struggling
I need a honey-bunny.

I don't know what to say anymore
So I'm just gonna go out, anywho
So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?
He looked at me with a face full of fright

And I said, how bout a revolution?
And he said right.
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say jah
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say jah
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say jah
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say jah jah jah

O.A.R.,"Hoping to find something better 
At least better than what ya thought 
So many aisles to venture down

You ask yourself why you can't stay just five more minutes alone 
And walk away 
You know it, mom knows it, so whatcha want 

She says, one toy today, she says 
Why only one or another or none at all 
How come every time I trip I never fall

O.A.R.,"She takes it deep to the heart right from the start she talks softly over a glass of wine.
Now and again she's more than a friend, why don't you just throw me that line.
It would be great if she'd dedicate just a minute from her precious time.
I'll give it a while, but that's not my style, now how is that a crime?

Everyone says that I'm wild.
Pardon my French but I still know my child.
And that was the day I told her I needed some time.

Well I began walking when she was still talking I'm looking for that exit sign.
Pardon my face but I'm leaving no trace cause I really haven't got the time.
Well I began thinking and my heart is just sinking and I'm looking for that place to go.
Isn't it sad that she'll treat you so bad, but you never really let her know.

And everyone says that she's crying.
But I can't forget all the time I spent trying.
And that was the day I told her I needed some time.

I know, I know what it feels like to be alone.
I know, I know what it feels like to be at home.
I like, I like stopping to say hello.
It's my life, my life why can't we take this slow?
Why can't we take this slow?

Well I've been through these phases, I've walked through these mazes.
I'm sick and I'm little tired.
It sure isn't fair but I'm not aware of the patience that's required.
If I could have kissed her every time that I missed her I wouldn't be out the door
But now and again, I sure need a friend now isn't that what she's for?

And everyone says that I'm lying,
But I can't forget all the time she spent crying.
And that was the day I told her I needed some time.

I know, I know what it feels like to be alone.
I know, I know what it feels like to be at home.
I like, I like stopping to say hello.
It's my life, my life why can't we take this slow?
Baby take it slow.
It's my life.
My life.
Why can't we take it slow?
Baby, take it slow.",[Untitled]
O.A.R.,"Well, in the end my friend, 
We will all be together again 
Clutching onto my hand, 
In a valley we'll stand, 
Just living again 
And in a while we'll smile, 
March on another mile 
On hallowed hills, attached to 
The land we'll be still 

No one's ever gonna say a thing 
And we'll be together, together again 
Taking off to the city on down 
Just a while ago my soul was confused, 
Amused at what it did not know 

Days went by, 
And amusement cried, 
I decide to let 
My soul fly on by itself, 
Pick happiness up and 
Bring it back to the shelf 
We'll be okay one day, 
In a valley we will stay 

No more moving on 
I knew it was right here all along 
Won't have to hold your crown, 
No more looking around 
Just holding you tight in the city on down 
Just a while ago my soul was confused, 
Amused at what it did not know 

But days went by and amusement cried 
I decide it's time, I got to move on now 
But I was so scared 
I was frightened, 
Somewhat enlightened 
So I changed shoes 

Now I walk through a valley of color 
Much better than the other 
Way I did not know, 
But now we can be united 
Miracle, miracle sighted, 
And I'm pulling it in 
I know by now we can all walk together 
At a regular speed 

Do you dare to be excited, 
Are you somewhat delighted? 
Are you aware somewhat delighted? 
At what you did not know 
Let's take it to the city on down",City on Down
O.A.R.,"There are few things pure in this world anymore, 
And home is one of the few. 
We'd have a drink outside, 
Maybe run and hide if we saw a couple men in blue. 

To me it's so damn easy to see 
That true people are the people at home. 
Well, I've been away but now I'm back today, 
And there ain't a place I'd rather go. 

I feel home, 
When I see the faces that remember my own. 
I feel home, 
When I'm chillin outside with the people I know. 

I feel home, 
And that's just what I feel. 
Home is reality, 
And all I need is something real. 

Feelin alright, headin out tonight, 
Maybe out to a dark driveway. 
I say now some feel bored, 
And some are lookin for more. 

Well, we all just decide to stay. 
We got nothin to do, 
And I look at you 
I see something that I know and love. 

And with the crack of a smile we all stay a while 
We know from home there ain't nothing above. 
Well in the end we can all call a friend 
Well that's something I know as true. 

And then a thousand years and a thousand tears 
I come to findingin(something's wrong here) my original crew 
'Cause to me throughout eternity 
There's somewhere where you're welcome to go 

I said it's something free that means a lot to me 
When I'm with my friends I feel home. 
I feel home, 
When I see the faces I remember my own 

I feel home, 
When I'm chillin outside with the people I know. 
I feel home, 
And that's just what I feel. 

Home is reality, 
And all I need something real 
Home is reality, 
And all I need something real 
I feel home.",I Feel Home
