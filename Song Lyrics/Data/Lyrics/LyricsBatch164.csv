Haze,"Esta es la historia de una niña que vivía 
En el barrio de la paz
De ella se decía que quería vende droga 
Como su papá 

Por ella nadie apostaba 
Su futuro se nublaba 
Y no había hecho mas 
Que empezar

Quien no quiere dinero
Dime, quien no quiere dinero 
Pa gastarlo en la ciudad 

Quería pan 
Quería joyas 
No valoras na si no lloras 
Lo mejor de no tener na 
Es tener que trabajar y sudar 
Por apartar la miseria a un lao 

Conseguir respeto 
A base de coraje y cojones 
Ella lo tenia, ella lo sabia 
Ella se lo merecía 
Valia pa eso y pa mas

Tenia to lo que quería 
Vestía la ropa con la que tu solo puedes soñar 

Muchos son los talentos 
Que se pierden en la na 
Pero cuando tu solo sirves pa traficar 
Es lo que pasa 

Te llaman, te llaman 
Teléfono no deja de sonar  
Esta es la historia de una niña que vivía 
En el barrio de la paz 
De ella se decía que quería vender droga 
Como su papá 

Por ella nadie apostaba 
Su futuro se nublaba 
Y no había echo mas que empezar 

Quien no quiere 
Dinero dime quien no quiere dinero 
Pa gastarlo en la ciudad 
A las 9 estaba allí 
Y era respeto lo que faltaba 
Si, cuidao volaron las balas 
Tan difícil es levantarse por la mañana? 

Por ser mujer, llevaba pistola, 
Ya sabes, pa no sentirse sola 
A nadie le gusta que le jodan 
Siempre tu tienes que pensar dos veces 
Quien se come la mierda cuando aparece 

Si sales de allí es porque tienes suerte 
Pa otra vez tendré mas cuidao
Mama, iré con gente 

Tenia to lo que quería 
Vestía la ropa con la que tu solo puedes soñar 

Esta es la historia de una niña que vivía 
En el barrio de la paz 
De ella se decía que quería 
Vende droga como su papá 
Por ella nadie apostaba 
Su futuro se nublaba 
Y no había echo mas que empezar 

Quien no quiere dinero 
Dime quien no quiere dinero 
Pa gastarlo en la ciudad",La Niña
Haze,"Por la noche

Sin reputación no hay respeto conozco esta zona
Esta mona no se anda por las rama
Hablo claro consecuencias llegan
Si me necesitas llama ¿por qué no?

Apunto alto me lo guiso apuesto por la noche
Oyendo ruidos que hacen los animales y los coches
Hago piezas de coleccionista y broches
Sin palabras no hay personas

Sin reputación no hay respeto conozco esta zona
Esta mona no se anda por las rama
Hablo claro consecuencias llegan
Si me necesitas llama

Café me mantiene cada mañana
Cada día en pie estudiando ciencias vigilando aceras
Mi ruido cae en la coctelera, en la hoguera
En la autopista un ungüento que no hace cualquiera

Sin embellecimiento en ese carro sin asiento
Me sientes lo siento yo no practico el arrepentimiento
Mi templo tiene cimiento
Puño y letra piso con seguridad, tos buscan equilibrio

Yo no freno calibro con brió aire sobrio
No cojeo os cojo dormío hijo mío
Te lo dan todo hecho y no dices ni pió
No se puede hacer mejor

Unidad de crisis a la orden del día
Si to' fuera perfecto ¿qué dirías?
Otro día más la misma mierda

¿Porque no? Apunto alto me lo guiso a puesto por la noche
Oyendo ruidos que hacen los animales y los coches
Hago piezas de coleccionistas y broches
Sin palabras no hay personas

Sin reputación no hay respeto conozco esta zona
Esta mona no se anda por las rama
Hablo claro consecuencias llegan
Si me necesitas llama

Cualquiera cuestiona, pocos responden
Dime como, cuando, donde
Somos los mismos con dinero y sin dinero
Yo no pido estragos lo mío primero

Sudo me cuesta trabajo hacerlo a mi manera
Lo estamos intentando, ¿qué más quieres?
Míale lamiendo las mieles yo tengo lo que tú quieres
Mala sin ser uno nueve siete nueve

Sé quién eres y con cuanto vienes, entiendo idiomas
Fíjate quien va hablar mírame a los ojos
Fíjate quien va hablar tengo pájaros en la cabeza
Que razonan encerraos en jaulas aprendiendo a hablar

Aunque duela dime la verdad
Le estás haciendo la cama cariño
Luego vas a tenerte que acostar en ella en la vida real
De qué sirven los respetos

¿Porque no? Apunto alto me lo guiso a puesto por la noche
Oyendo ruidos que hacen los animales y los coches
Hago piezas de coleccionistas y broches
Sin palabras no hay personas

Sin reputación no hay respeto conozco esta zona
Esta mona no se anda por las rama
Hablo claro consecuencias llegan
Si me necesitas llama

¿Porque no? Apunto alto me lo guiso a puesto por la noche
Oyendo ruidos que hacen los animales y los coches
Hago piezas de coleccionistas y broches
Sin palabras no hay personas

Sin reputación no hay respeto conozco esta zona

",Por la Noche
Haze,"Vivo en una cárcel sin muros, se llama ignorancia
Perdí la inocencia, la infancia y gané respeto 
Aprender en la calle es duro, probé las sustancias 
Sentí la violencia y el ansia por ganar dinero 
Frío, bandera negra pirata mi alma 
He sido, carne de cañón, sentí el calor del cañón 
Pero el calor del cariño en mi piel yo nunca lo he sentío 
Aquí las sirenas anuncian otro barco hundío 
Perdío, de quién me fío
Lucifer las carga pero no es el que dispara el arma 
La blanca me calma, pierdo el sentío 
Estando ciego no siento
Cállate puta conciencia, sé lo que he perdío 
Quién tiene la culpa, quién conoce los límites
Un narco en un barrio es un héroe, yo solo lo imité
Me refugio en la escritura, el tiempo es mi vigía
Una carta más en esta celda fría

En esta celda, me estoy muriendo por verte
Dibujo en las paredes, un corazón con tu nombre 
Y en esta carta, pido que vengas a verme
Porque me siento mu' solo y el tiempo aquí se detiene

Muero en una vida distinta, se llama presidio
Conmigo vive el odio y reside la venganza 
Un bala perdía, un pinta, pienso en el suicidio 
Ella no viene a verme, no me escribe mi esperanza
No pienso perderte, no te llegan mis cartas
Maldita sea, estoy en el patio, buscando pelea
Con sangre en los nudillos, el corazón me patalea 
Me suda el carajo el funcionario y que me vea
Si no vienes, si no escribes, me siento solo 
Voy a chinarme como un perro, a desangrarme en el chabolo
Y luego sentiré el frío, de qué me sirve rezar
Dios mío, te desafío

En esta celda, me estoy muriendo por verte
Dibujo en las paredes, un corazón con tu nombre 
Y en esta carta, pido que vengas a verme
Porque me siento mu' solo y el tiempo aquí se detiene 

De noche me quedo dormío, y sueño que has venío a verme 
Entonces se me pasa el frío y en el recuento no me despiertes

Y en esta celda, me estoy muriendo por verte
Dibujo en las paredes, un corazón con tu nombre 
Y en esta carta, pido que vengas a verme
Porque me siento mu' solo y el tiempo aquí se detiene 

Esto es un canto de esperanza 
Pa' un mundo de cemento y hierro, 
Adri, vuela, vuela lejos de alhaurín, y tú
Y tú, compi, paciencia, seca esas lágrimas
Que de ahí se sale, me entiendes
De ahí se sale, libertad 

En esta celda, me estoy muriendo por verte
Dibujo en las paredes, un corazón con tu nombre 
Y en esta carta, pido que vengas a verme 
Porque me siento mu' solo y el tiempo aquí se detiene",En Esta Celda

Hazel,"Inky black, like my arms
47 lucky charms
Passing through me
Never ending
A gift, my sweet, I was sending
Never happened, not supposed to
All I wanted

Was to be next to you
Through December, I just waited
You got angry, and I felt cheated
Should have left it
All the distance
Broken hearted

With no resistance
47 lucky charms
On your table and in your arms
We never happened
There's a reason why it ended

Confused and deadened
So that I'll carry
With my years
The sound of you
Ringing in my ears",Ringing in My Ears
Hazel Dickens,"Well I tried to be the kind of woman you wanted me to be
And it's not your fault that I tried to be what I thought you wanted to see
Smilin' face shinnin' hair clothes that I thought you'd like me to wear
Made to please and not to tease it's the custom made woman blues.

Yes I tried to be the kind of woman you wanted me to be
And I tried to see life your way and say all the things you'd like me to say
Lovin' looks gentle hands an guaranteed to keep a' holdin' your man
Made to please and not to tease it's the custom made woman blues.

And now you say you're tired of me and all of those things I thought you wanted me to be
Is it true you want some one who knows how to think and do on her own
Lord it's hard to realize the lessons I learned so was young were nothing but lies
Made to please and not to tease it's the custom made woman blues
Made to please and not to tease it's the custom made woman blues.

Hazel Dickens,"Oh the green rolling hills of West Virginia
   Are the nearest thing to heaven that I know
   Though the times are sad and drear and I cannot linger here
   They'll keep me and never let me go.

My daddy said don't ever be a miner
or a miner's grave is all you'll ever own
There's hard times everywhere I can't find a dime to spare
These are the worst times I've ever known

So I'll move away into some crowded city
In some northern factory town you'll find me there
Though I'll leave the past behind 'll never change my mind
These troubled times are more than I can bear.

Someday I'll go back to West Virginia
To those green rolling hills I love so well
Oh someday I'll go home and I know I'll right the wrong
And these hard times will follow me no more.",The Green Rolling Hills of West Virginia
Hazel Dickens," Now you're back on my doorstep a' crying
   Like I cried through all those lonely years
   But I can't dry your tears it's been too long since love was here
   And I've already gave you my better years

And so the pages of time kept right on turning
They never stopped for us to harvest the years
And old embers of love kept right on dying
For there was no one to drown my tears.

But I've tried not to blame you
and I try not to shame you
All I can do now is wish you well
But if you should need a friend
I'll be there until the end
Just don't ask me to love you again.

   And don't come back to my doorstep a' crying
   Hoping for what's been dead so long
   For the embers have all turned to ashes
   There's nothing here but old memories and this song.

   No don't come back to my doorstep a' crying
   There's nothing here but old memories and this song.

Hazel Dickens,"CALL HIM DRUNKEN IRA HAYES,

HE WON`T ANSWER ANY MORE;

NOT THE WHISKEY DRINKIN` INDIAN,

NOT THE MARINE WHO WENT TO WAR.


[verse 1]:

GATHER `ROUND ME PEOPLE,

THERE`S A STORY I WOULD TELL

ABOUT A BRAVE YOUNG INDIAN

YOU SHOULD REMEMBER WELL;

FROM THE LAND OF THE PIMA INDIANS -

A PROUD AND NOBLE BAND,

WHO FARMED THE PHOENIX VALLEY - 

IN ARIZONA LAND.


[verse 2]:

DOWN THEIR DITCHES FOR A THOUSAND YEARS -

THE WATERS GREW IRA`S PEOPLE`S CROPS,

TILL THE WHITE MAN STOLE THEIR WATER RIGHTS -

AND THEIR SPARKLIN` WATER STOPPED.

NOW IRA`S FOLKS GREW HUNGRY -

AND THEIR LAND GREW CROPS OF WEEDS.

WHEN WAR CAME IRA VOLUNTEERED -

AND FORGOT THE WHITE MAN`S GREED.


[Chorus]:

CALL HIM DRUNKEN IRA HAYES,

HE WON`T ANSWER ANY MORE;

NOT THE WHISKEY DRINKIN` INDIAN,

NOT THE MARINE WHO WENT TO WAR.


[verse 3]:

WELL, THEY BATTLE UP IWO JIMA HILL -

TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEN,

BUT ONLY TWENTY SEVEN LIVED 

TO WALK BACK DOWN AGAIN;

WHEN THE FIGHT WAS OVER -

AND OLD GLORY RAISED,

AMONG THE MEN WHO HELD IT HIGH

WAS INDIAN IRA HAYES.


[Chorus]:

CALL HIM DRUNKEN IRA HAYES,

HE WON`T ANSWER ANY MORE;

NOT THE WHISKEY DRINKIN` INDIAN,

NOT THE MARINE WHO WENT TO WAR.


[verse 4]:

IRA HAYES RETURNED A HERO,

CELEBRATED THROUGH THE LAND,

HE WAS WINED AND SPEECHED AND HONORED,

EVERYBODY SHOOK HIS HAND;

BUT HE WAS JUST A PIMA INDIAN,

NO WATER, NO HOME, NO CHANCE;

AT HOME NOBODY CARED WHAT IRA HAD DONE -

AND WHEN DO THE INDIANS DANCE?


[Chorus]:

CALL HIM DRUNKEN IRA HAYES,

HE WON`T ANSWER ANY MORE;

NOT THE WHISKEY DRINKIN` INDIAN,

NOT THE MARINE WHO WENT TO WAR.


[verse 5]:

THEN IRA STARTED DRINKIN` HARD,

JAIL WAS OFTEN HIS HOME;

THEY LET HIM RAISE THE FLAG AND LOWER IT,

AS YOU WOULD THROW A DOG A BONE;

HE DIED DRUNK EARLY ONE MORNING,

ALONE IN THE LAND HE`D FOUGHT TO SAVE;

TWO INCHES OF WATER IN A LONELY DITCH -

WAS THE GRAVE FOR IRA HAYES.


[Chorus]:

CALL HIM DRUNKEN IRA HAYES,

HE WON`T ANSWER ANY MORE;

NOT THE WHISKEY DRINKIN` INDIAN,

NOT THE MARINE WHO WENT TO WAR.


[verse 6]:

YEAH! CALL HIM DRUNKEN IRA HAYES,

BUT HIS LAND IS JUST AS DRY,

AND THE GHOST IS LYING THIRSTY

IN THE DITCH WHERE IRA DIED.
",The Ballad of Ira Hayes
Hazel Dickens,"There's a path that leads back through my memories
And how often I've walked it these days
Where I find sweet piece among the flowers
On the grassy banks beyond the river bend

But it's only a memory
Yes it's only a memory my friend
Yes it's only a memory
I can never go back home again

Down by the river
Down by the old river bend
Down by the river
The sweet fragrance of flowers 

Oh it seems life troubles and trials
Get harder and harder to mend
Oh how sweet it would be to sit down
On the grassy banks beyond the river bend

But it's only a memory
Yes it's only a memory my friend
Yes it's only a memory
I can never go back home again

Down by the river
Down by the old river bend
Down by the river
The sweet fragrance of flowers ",Beyond the River Bend
Hazel Dickens,"The bills are all dues, the babies need shoes, I'm busted
Cotton is down to a quarter a pound, I'm busted
Got a cow that's gone dry, hen that won't lay
A big stack of bill's get bigger each day
The county gonna haul my belongings away, I'm busted

I called brother Bill to ask for a loan, I was busted
Lord, I hate to beg like a dog for a bone, I'm busted
My brother said, “There ain't a thing I can do
My wife and my kids, they're all down with the flu
I was just thinkin' of callin' on you, I'm busted”

Now Lord, I'm no thief but I can go wrong, I'm so busted
The food that we canned last summer is gone, I'm busted
The fields are all bare, the cotton won't grow
Me and my family's gotta pack up and go
Where I'll make a livin', Lord only knows I'm busted
Where I'll make a livin', Lord only knows I'm busted

Hazel Dickens,"Just a few old memories
Slipped in through my door
Though I thought I had closed it
So tightly before
I can't understand it
Why it should bother my mind
For it all belongs to another place and time

Just a few old keep-sakes
Way back on the shelf
No, they don't mean nothin'
Well I'm surprised they're still left
Just a few old love letters
With the edges all brown
And an old faded picture
I keep turned upside-down

Just a few old memories
Going way back in time
Well I can hardly remember
I don't know why I'm cryin'
I can't understand it
Well I'm surprised myself
First thing tomorrow morning
I'll clean off that shelf

Just a few old keep-sakes
Way back on the shelf
No, they don't mean nothin'
Well I'm surprised that they're left
Just a few old love letters
With their edges all brown
And an old faded picture
I keep turned upside-down

Hazel Dickens,"There ain't much that's left here that ain't all run down.
Gone all the echoes of old familiar sound.
Families are scattered, parted, and gone.
Left a lot of good things to wither away back home.

(Chorus:) Can't you feel those hills around you?
Can't you feel that touch of home?
And don't you wish you'd never gone?
There are some things memories can't bring home.
Hills of home, hills of home,
Families scattered off and gone.
These old hills that have been passed by,
Well, they've seen their share of leavin' in their time.

Old familiar dirt roads wind through the piney glade,
Where all the longing of childhood dreams were made,
Where we passed the mossy mounds where I could run and play,
Never a care to cross my mind all the livelong day. (Chorus)

Yes, they've seen their share of leavin' in their time.",Hills of Home
Hazel Dickens,"She's lost a lot of herself that time cannot replace
Bits and pieces of herself gone without a trace
She's been holding on to everything that happened to be there
She's all used up and forgotten and scatterd eveerywhere

She's not an angel, so don't look for her wings
She's a hurtin woman who lives the song she sings
She learned them all the hard way on the streets all alone
That's why it's hard to tell the singer from the song

One by one her young years were gone before she knew
Wasted on some loser who was only walking through
Each time her bruised and lonely heart tried to break the fall
Rather put the pieces of the life on the wall

She's not an angel, so don't look for her wings
She's a hurtin woman who lives the song she sings
She learned them all the hard way on the streets all alone
That's why it's hard to tell the singer from the song

Hazel Dickens,"MAMA'S HANDS

I said goodbye to that plain little miner town
With just a few old clothes that layed around
I knew I was leavin' a lot a things they were good
But I thought I'd make a break while I still could;

As I looked back to wave once more
To mama cryin' in the door
For me and what the world might have in store
For she knew I'd never be her little girl no more;

But she was driftin' back to another time
When she was young and hoped to find
A better life than what her mama's had been
But it was so they'd go of mama's hands, my mama's hands;

CHORUS
One old paper bag filled with hand-me-downs
Plain old country girl raised on gospel sounds
With only the love she gave me and pride in what I am
It was hard to let go of mama's hands, my mama's hands.

I thought of all the love she gave
I thought of all the years she slaved
To try and make this run-down shack a home
A dream that really died 'fore it was born;

But she pulled us thru the hardest times
And made us hold our head up high
A gift we carry with us all our lives
For we were special in mama's eyes

As I looked down the dusty road
To mama and her heavy load
I knew I was leavin' i'd never find again
It was hard to let go of mama's hands, my mama's hands.

Fly Fly away 
Fly away little pretty bird
And pretty you'll always stay

I see in your eyes a promise
Your own tender love you bring
But fly away little pretty bird
Close    the spring

Loves own tender flame warms this meeting
And loves tender song should sing
But fly away little pretty bird

For love is such a daily good thing
Fly away little pretty bird
For he'd only clip your wings

Hazel Dickens,"I held him as close as I dared to go
All his sweet love has started to show

I know that I love him, need him so much
But the scars from an old love haven't quite healed enough

Hazel Dickens,"Hey I got the early Monday morning working blues
I put on my worn out working shoes
Well the weekend was too short but I can choose
When the lord made the working girl, he made the blues

Well I'm tired of working my life way
And givin someone else all of my pay
While they get rich on the profits that I lose
And leaving me here with the working girl blues

And I can't even afford a new pair of shoes
While they can live in any penthouse they choose

But I wonder will my hair be all turned gray
Before he turns that dollar loose and I get my dues
And lose a little bit of these working girl blues

Bending my branches so low.

And every time you ask me how I'm feeling
I just smile and tell you that I'm fine

I, I don't know why I'm terrified of everything

For most of my life I felt a sharp uncertainty

Can I just make some more romance with you, my love?

Well, I wanna make love to you tonight
I can't wait 'til the morning has come

And straight in to my arms you will run

And when you come, my heart will be waiting
To make sure that you're never alone

Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous night to make romance
'Neath the cover of October skies

And all the leaves on the trees are falling
To the sound of the breezes that blow
And I'm trying to please to the calling
Of your heart strings that play soft and low

And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush

Hazel O'Connor,"They'll tear out your heart, throw it knee-deep in a cart
'cause that's what they do with the scum like me and you
And you feel as if you died, whilst you're standing on the line
And you wonder all the time why can't you cry?
But the people in control don't care for you
They're just a robot with a job to do
And when your use is exhausted, they'll be rid of you
As soon as look at you, go to the back of the queue!

But while his dungeon had a way to show him
He should be more useful, as they broke into his skull

Searching frantically the place where you belong
Gave you a map that showed you your direction
A shadow tore it up and told you it was wrong
That way was too long
And danced a little song

Come into the air, cast your body like a care
You belong nowhere and you can't bear it
Come into the air, cast your body like a care
Life just isn't there, if you can't share it
So why not dare it?

Feed your eyes on cold grey city concrete
An extra pair of arms is what you really need
But keep the secret, today no one can touch you
Dine on passion, then let your heart bleed
Alone at night it's dark
Hear a lonely dog bark

Come into the air, cast your body like a care
You belong nowhere and you can't bear it
Come into the air, cast your body like a care
Life just isn't there, if you can't share it
So why not dare it?

Electric scenes and laser beams, neon brights the light abhorring nights
On the second day he said: Let's have a gas
Hydrogen and cholera and pest
Let's make some germs, we'll poison the worms
Man will never be suppressed

And he said: Behold what I have done
I've made a better world for everyone
Nobody laugh, nobody cry
World without end, forever and ever
Amen, amen, amen

On the third we get green and blue for pie
On the fourth we send rockets to the sky
On the fifth make the beasts and submarines
On the sixth man prepares his final dream:
In our image, let's make robots for our slaves
Imagine all the time that we can save
Computers, machines, the silicon dream
Seventh he retired from the scene

And he said: Behold what I have done
I've made a better world for everyone
Nobody laugh, nobody cry
World without end, forever and ever
Amen (amen), amen (amen), amen (amen)

On the eighth day machine just got upset
A problem man had never seen as yet
No time for flight, a blinding light
And nothing but a void, forever night

He said: Behold what man has done
There's not a world for anyone
Nobody laughed, nobody cried
World's at an end, everyone has died

You guard your heart, so they steal your sight
You reach out in blindness, touch the alone
His icicle fingers chill you to the bone

What do you do when the cat gets ya tongue?
No way to tell it's all going wrong
Mouth out the words on the telephone
Nobody answers, nobody's home...

What's done has been done, and I won't be the one
Who despairs in the wheelchair, resigned to ""If only""
No, I'll stand up again and I'll run
I'll jump up till I touch the sun
Because I won't be the one to be bound
By the sound of ""If only, if only, if only""

Well, I reach out in blindness now, but what do I care?
I'll walk into walls and I'll stumble downstairs
I'll laugh like a fishwife, I'll cry like a clown
Up is the only way to go when you're down

When I reach a mountain top, then I start to climb
I'll walk on the water, I'll turn water to wine
Hope is the one thing we got on our side
Hope can be salvaged when all else has died

What's done has been done, and I won't be the one
Who despairs in the wheelchair, resigned to ""If only""

White papers that you say apply to me
Reams of rules constructed for protection
Protection for yourselves, but not for me

You hide behind your walls of bureaucracy
I find that you've nothing to do with me
You're all aliens
I opened up my eyes, and saw to my surprise
Monsters in disguise, wearing bowler hats and old school ties

Today you went out to inspect your servants
I saw you wave and rave from my T.V.
You promised soon that they would have a paper
Give them the right to kill quite legally

So you hide in your palace of bureaucracy
I hope that you never come terminate me

As you and me and she and he

And we always believed that we're something unique
Our new little rich friends want us in their clique
And we'll play, we'll play all of our days away

There's you scratching my back, me scratching yours
Rub up the right way, it always ensures
We'll know the right people, open right doors
To the land of the famous incredible bores

And I got no respect for you, you're just a fake
Gave up your lot for a bite of the cake
And we'll play, we'll play all of our days away

How could we feel? We're so unreal
Stuck at the top of the wheel
You're the sucker who fell for their spiel
You're the crawler who fell for their deal

Your smug little cliches, they get up my nose
Your hair dyed, your fine clothes, they're all for the pose
Naked before me, your cover is blown

Here come the robots, the mindless, the clones
And you sold up our insides, body and soul
Do as you're told now, and we'll play our roles
And we'll play, we'll play all of our days away

Who needs it? (Who needs it?)
If he gets in the dungeon, he could just press the button

Hazel O'Connor,"Manchester morning, Picadilly calling
I ask myself what is it to be free
Free from sorrow, love's tomorrow
Oh if I had a key how different it could be

We didn't have much money then
But we were brave, we'd take each day
And danger with a smile
Well we couldn't see finality in our golden mile

And now we're just good friends
Ooh and friends are things that ought to last forever
Yeah we're just good friends
But I don't see you no more
You don't even call
What kind of strange friendship is this

One evening when you'd were leaving
Fly fly away my bird, fly off to find your son
Soon come tomorrow, soon come the sorrow
If you'd just stay for once, how different it would go

I thought I saw you at the station today
So you panicked and run, oh run you silly boy
Run away, like the bird that got stuck in the skylight
He can see it but he'll never reach the sky

And now we're just good friends
Ooh and friends are things that ought to last forever
Yeah we're just good friends
But I don't see you no more
You don't even call

We used to be so different you and me
We were lovers, and that's a fact
And now I see, there's distance between you and me
And I can't seem to face the fact

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd, I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday, maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home, just meant for two
From which I'll never roam, who would, would you?
And so all else above, I'm waiting for the man I love

Here comes my friend Michael,
Grin written over his face
Walking with a kind of a swagger,
Walking with a kind of a grace
He talks the talk, he tries to walk the walk
He makes you laugh, he makes you really mad,
He'll lick you with an acid tongue
Make you feel he's right,
When you know he's wrong
He says life's a bitch and then you die,
And then you die

But in the meantime, maybe in the meantime,
He keep on smiling
In the meantime, maybe in the meantime
Like Michael says it's Mardi Gras

I don't think that life's like that,
Choice of word is bad
Maybe it's a kind of a lesson,
Maybe it's a sort of a map
We talk the talk, we try to walk the walk
It makes you laugh, and makes you feel
Like you've been had
And maybe we will live many lives

Keep coming back 'til we realize it's in our hands
We choose to do wrong or do right

But in the meantime, maybe in the meantime,
He keep on smiling
In the meantime, maybe in the meantime
Like Michael says it's Mardi Gras

The sun comes up and the sun comes down,
In the meantime
And the world keeps turning and
We're living and learning
In the meantime
And I think of you and wonder what you're doing,
In the meantime
Do you think of me and
What there could have been in the meantime

Here comes my friend Michael,
Grin written over his face
Walking with a kind of a swagger,
Walking with a sort of a grace

Make you feel he's right,

Her lofty scenes, her valley's green, her mountains rude and wild
They say it is a lovely land wherein a prince might dwell
Oh why did you abandon it the reason to me tell

Oh well do I remember that bleak December day
The landlord and the sheriff came to drive us all away
He set my roof on fire, when my rent I could not find
And that's the cruel reason that I left it all behind

Your mother too, god rest her soul, she fell on snowy ground
She could not raise her body, seeing desolation around
She never rose but slipped away from life to mortal dream
And found a quiet grave my boy in dear old skibbereen

And you were only two years old and feeble was your frame
I could not leave you with my friends, you bore your father's name
I wrapped you in my cottamore, in the dead of night unseen
I heaved a sigh, and bade goodbye to dear old skibbereen

One morning fair as I took the air
Down by Blackwater Side
And when staring all around me
An Irish lad I spied

All through the far part of the night
We spent in sport and play
Then the young man rose and put on his clothes
Saying faretheewell today

Go back, go back to your father's garden
Go back and cry your fill
And think upon your sad misfortune
You brought on by your wanton will

That's not the promise that you made to me
When you lay on my breast
I would have believed with your lying tongue
That the sun rose in the west

Go back, go back to your father's garden
Go back and cry your fill
And think upon your sad misfortune
You brought on by your wanton will

There's not a girl in this whole wide world
As easily led as I
And when fishes do fly and seas do run dry
It is when you will marry I

Go back, go back to your father's garden
Go back and cry your fill
And think upon your sad misfortune
You brought on by your wanton will
You brought on by your wanton will
You brought on by your wanton will

Daylight, slowly creeping through the crack in the curtains
And it suddenly reminded me I didn't sleep allnight.
It's just the thought of you I'll swear,
Lyin' in the fatal position,

How can I sleep?
How can I sleep when it cuts too deep?
It cuts too deep.

Take a handfull of magic,
Weigh it up on the scales
Of the wrong place, the wrong time
Take one body of a memory
Of a bright bright eyes
I can't erase from my mind

Oh, take one girl who said yeah
I can handle it, in the voice of a child.
Does that child weep?
Does that weep,
No it cuts too deep,
It cuts too deep

Yeah well, I've cried in the morning
And I've cried at night,
I've stamped on the pain of too much longing
I've cried in the morning
And I've cried at night
Now it' all done
Now it's all done.

All the dreams I've dreamed
I shall dream again eternally speaking
Just now the face of eternity
Looks blank into the face of time

Lying in that naked position
Oh, how could I speak?
How could I speak when it cuts too deep
It cuts too deep
Oh, it cuts too deep

She went her way homeward with one star awake
As the swan in the evening moves over the lake

Who are you to tie me down when you were not always around?
Who are you when I can't get you out of my life?

Hazell Dean,"Did you believe I'd let you down
Your jealous heart?
Gave you the runaround you couldn't see
That I would always be your friend

If you can look inside your heart
And understand what's tearing you apart
You gotta trust someone
Don't let hate get in the way

Just turn it into love, turn it into love
And open up your heart and you'll
Never feel ashamed if you
Turn it, turn it, turn it into love

When all your other friends are gone
I'll still be here to help you carry on
If you have faith in me
Then I'll believe in you

You are the first thing on my mind
Do you believe I wouldn't have the time?
I have to make you see
You can't put the pain on me

Just turn it into love, turn it into love
And open up your heart and you'll
Never feel ashamed if you
Turn it, turn it, turn it into love

Just turn it into love
Just turn it into love
Just turn it into love

Thought I'd moved on and you brought me right back
To the night you took my kiss away from me
I took yours too, then I lost you

Bring me back to holding hands in the rain

Lift you up so you could finally see

Tell me I dont give up
Tell me there's someone out there
Give me a pure love
Give me a forever that we can both share

Show me its okay
Show me its all right
That i'm fall from crazy for living my fate not by side

Will he be proud of
All of the things I've done
My mistakes, the things that I, regret
Wishing that i could forget

I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge 
Against something that I can hardly see
But to say that there's no reason for everything
Leaves me doubtful and in dreams to say the least

But if you do, you better agree

Your to funny to be so heavenly

I got your number and you only show me 
Just a little common decency
I knew before you
When you bless me test me
And answer with this plague inside of me

Bleed with the sky above
Over the demon under me

You've been dealin' with the devil
And cast your soul away

Ol' brother Jacob lived 93 years
Not a second of it on his knees
He lived in a little wood shanty
Down the road a little piece

All he ever seemed to care about
Was his money that he saved so long
Always tryin' to get a few dollars
Any way, right or wrong

Hey brother Jacob
I trust you're well today
You've been dealin' with the devil
And cast your soul away

The only part that you have to doubt
Is where it says you don't have to pay
Ol' brother Jacob gambled and lost
When he sold his soul today

The story came down from the mountain town
Brother Jacob was called away
They say that the devil came for him
And they swear it to this very day

Then again, there's another tale
That's told around the town
Says Brother Jacob is still alive
And livin' underground

Hey brother Jacob

And cast your soul away

It's a record of total abuse
You better stop preaching and listen here
Your arms and legs are gonna get some use

It's a call to arms and legs
It's about time we quit foolin' around
It's a call to arms and legs
Better get'em ready, hear the bugle sound
(Repeat 2 more times)

Better get'em ready, hear the bugle sound
Yeah
It's a call to arms and legs
It's about time we quit foolin' around

Head East,"Depend on what she brings you, she's keepin' you alive
You know the price you're payin' or you wouldn't waste your time
The need you have is growin' while the feelin' makes you sing
A woman's gone and left me and she's taken everything

There's a way in which she loves you and no one takes her place
She takes away your sorrow with a warm and easy taste
She leaves you feelin' satisfied that someone really cares
Now she's gone and I wish that she was never really there

Don't let me sleep in the morning and break up the day
Don't let me tell you a story and hear what you say
Don't try to tell me you're sorry and get in the way
Don't let me sleep in the morning and break up the day

There's a lady in the corner who sees the show for free
Tonight I'll try to show her just how much she means to me
She'll leave before it's over and I won't even see
But tomorrow night she'll come back and see what's left of me
See what's let of me, see what's left of me, see what's left of me

",Don't Let Me Sleep in the Morning
Head East,"Girl you know you're in my soul
You keep me awake all night
Well I don't know if I'm just comin' or gone
And how to make it right

Well I don't know what you're all about
I ain't had time yet to figure it out
All I know is how good you feel to me
Oh girl can't you see and...

Show me I'm alive
Please take me anywhere you've known
You can see it in my eyes sometimes
I can't believe alone
(Repeat again after a break)

I've seen so many places and made-up faces
That I never want to see again
But I know that I'll remember your smilin' face
When I get back, oh when I get back again
Won't you please...

Show me I'm alive
Please take me anywhere you've known
You can see in my eyes sometimes
I can't believe alone
Won't you show me I'm alive
Please take me anywhere, anywhere you've known
You can see it in my eyes sometimes

",Show Me I'm Alive
Head East,"She was a girl all alone in the world
But she was young and she was free
She understood the supernatural
A real lady of mystery
She could feel the earth turning
Way down beneath her feet
You could just imagine
What a trip she was to meet

Feelin' her spell comin' on
Showin' you how to have fun
Wonderin' where she's gone
Take it on home

Saturday night down at old camopus town
Helpin' everyone hold up the wall
Hangin' around watchin' dancers get down
Wonder why I show up at all
But then it's just like magic
When she walks out on the floor
She begins to dancin'
And your soul cries out for more

Feelin' her spell comin' on
Showin' you how to have fun
Wonderin' where she's gone
Take it on home

Feelin' her spell comin' on
Showin' you how to have fun
Wonderin' where she's gone

",Take It on Home
Head East,"You know it won't take much
To change the way I feel
Sitting here all alone
The tears I can't conceal
Time has a way
Of making everything okay

Ah ah, people come and go
Ah ah, they don't seem to know
That it won't take much
To change their way of life
Open up their minds
Forget their hate and strife

Of making everything okay

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

",Time Has a Way
Head East,"Day and night, sittin' alone
Wonderin' where you've been goin'
In my mind I can see your face
And the love that I thought it was showin'

Didn't know it was all a mask
And my love wasted devotion
Now I'm here and you're somewhere else
Dancin' with another's emotion, another's emotion

I remember the night you captured my soul
And the mind of my own, I lost all control
I knew I had seen you before
In so many of my dreams

Like the dreams you danced away
Leaving only visions for me
Of the dance away
Dance away lover

Leading me on every step of the way
You called the tune and you used it well
You danced away and you left me here
Oh dance away, dance away lover, lover, lover, dance away

Repeat 1st and 2nd verses

Dance away, dance away lover
Carrying on every step of the way
You called the tune and you used it well
You danced away and you left me here
Oh dance away, dance away lover, lover, lover, dance away
Dance away...dance away



",Dance Away Lover
Head East,"Standing by my window
Darkest, coldest night I've ever seen
I feel like I'm fallin' over the edge of a dream

I'm looking back on all the fun we had
I can remember how we thought we had it bad
Laughin' and cryin' together and sleepin' on the floor
We had nothing to lose but it seemed like so much more

Livin' on love and highway signs
Didn't have nothin, just nickels and dimes
Woke up new and our hearts rang true
Thank God, we lived behind the times

[Chorus]
I'm thinkin' back on all the fun we had
I can remember how we thought we had it bad
Laughin' and cryin' together and sleepin' on the floor
We had nothing to lose but it seemed like so much more
And I hope that the good times come again
Hope that the good times come again

Now I stand here all on my own
Watchin' the sunset, feelin' alone
Meet me back at the places and faces
And to all the good times we had known

Head East,"We started out a long time ago
We didn't know what to do
Knockin' our romances, we took the chances
That a lot of us do
Well, we've seen strange places
We fell on our faces
It was all on the line
Cause we believed in what we were
And we know that we would see it in time

A reason to carry on
Is the feelin' when the music's done
Maybe we'll take someone's whole life
(And) turn their head around
Open up the door

Listen to me you've got to help me
I can't help myself
It's been a long long time
Wish it were mine
I can't help myself
I've been searchin' everywhere
Lookin' here and there
And I finally see
It may take forever and it never
But will you listen to me

A reason to carry on
Is the feelin' when the music's done
Maybe we'll take someone's whole life
(And) turn their head around
It's a reason to carry on, it's a reason to carry
Open up the door

A reason to carry on
Is the feelin' when the music's done
Maybe we'll take someone's whole life
And turn their head around
Open up the door oh oh

Is a feelin' when the music's done
Maybe we'll take someone's whole life

I can lean left or right
We didn't know it would take so little
To turn the darkness into light
Looking through pictures in my mind

We saw the sea, we saw the mountain
We watch the sun sink into night
Hand in hand there was no question
We knew the birds would soar in flight
Looking through pictures in my mind

These pictures come to me

Headshots,"Â??Dungeons and Dragonsâ?? by Dr. Demento

Narrator: Dungeons and Dragons, Satan's game. Your children like it or not, are attracted in their weaker years to the Occult and a game like D+D fuels their imagination and makes them feel special, while drawing them deeper and deeper into the bowels of El Diablo. This afternoon the Dead Alewives watch tower invites you to sit in on an actual gaming session. Observe the previously unobservable as a hidden camera takes you to the inner sanctum of Dungeons and Dragons

Graham: Galstaff you have entered the door to the north. You are now by yourself standing in a dark room, the pungent stench of mildew emanates off the wet dungeon walls.

Nightblade: Where are the Cheetos!

Graham: They're right next to you.

Galstaff: I cast a spell.

Nightblade: Where's the Mountain Dew!

Graham: In the Fridge. DUH!

Galstaff: I wanna cast a spell.

Nightblade: Can I have a Mountain Dew!

Graham: Yes, you can have a Mountain Dew just go get it.

Galstaff: I can cast any of these right, on the list?

Graham: Yes, any any of the first level ones.

Nightblade: I'm gonna get a soda, any one want one? Hey Graham I'm not in the room right?

Graham: What room?

Galstaff: I wanna cast magic missile.

Nightblade: The room where he's casting all these spells from!

Graham: He hasn't cast any thing yet.

Galstaff: I am though if you'd listen. I'm casting Magic Missile.

Graham: Why are you casting Magic Missile, there's nothing to attack here.

Galstaff: I- I- I'm attacking the darkness.

(laughing)

Graham: Fine fine you attack the darkness there's an elf in front of you.

Picard: Whoa! That's me right?

Graham: He's wearing a brown tunic and he has gray hair and blue eyes.

Picard: No I don't, I have gray eyes.

Graham: Let me see that sheet.

Picard: Well it says I have, well it says I have blue but I decided I wanted gray eyes.

Graham: Whatever, ok, you guys can talk now if you want.

Galstaff: Hello.

Picard: Hello.

Galstaff: I am Galstaff, Sorcerer of Light.

Picard: Then how come you had to cast Magic Missile?

(laughing)

Graham: why- why- why- You guys are being attacked.

Nightblade: Do I see that happening!?!

Graham: NO! You're outside by the tavern.

Nightblade: Cool, I get drunk!

Graham: Ugh. There are there are seven ogres surrounding you.

Picard: How can they surround us? I had Mordenkainens Magical Watch Dog cast!

Graham: No you didn't.

Nightblade: I'm getting drunk! Are there any girls there?

Picard: I totally did. You asked me if I wanted any equipment before this adventure, and I said no, but I need material components for all my spells, so I cast Mordenkainens Faithful Watch Dog.

Graham: But you never actually cast it.

Nightblade: Roll the dice to see if I'm getting drunk!

Graham: Ugh. Yeah you are.

Nightblade: Are there any girls there?

Graham: Yeah!

Picard: I did though; I completely said when you asked me...

Graham: No you didn't. You didn't actually say that you were casting the spell so now there's ogres. Ok.

Nightblade: OGRES!?! Man, I got an ogre slaying knife! It's got a +9 against ogres!

Graham: You're not there, you're getting DRUNK!

Nightblade: Ok, but if there's any girls there I wanna do them!

Narrator: There you have it. A frightening look into Americas most frightening past time. Remember that it's not you children's fault that's their being drawn into a satanic world of nightmare. It's their gym teachers fault for making them feel out cast when they couldn't do one single pull up.

Oh oh
I heard a whisper that touched deep inside my soul
Like some familiar melody
A hidden chapter from a story left untold
I gotta feeling, I could believe in

There is an angel in my heart
Feels like I'm guided by a candle in the dark
It's taken all this time
To finally find out what I could never see
You were there for me
Now there is no doubt that there will always be
An angel in my heart

You were the friend, you were the one I could confide in
You gave me strength that I could never find
Deep emotions that I've always been denyin'
I believe in, it's so close now it's you that I'm feeling

There is an angel in my heart
Feels like I'm guided by a candle in the dark
It's taken all this time
To finally find out what I could never see
You were there for me
Now there is no doubt that there will always be
An angel in my heart

Finally found what I been searching for (all my life)
It was right before my eyes

Oh, you are my one and only angel
I know you'll always be there
You are my one and only angel, Angel

To finally find at what I could never see
You were there for me
Now there is no doubt that there will always be
An angel in my heart

We hit rock

I ain't dealin' with

No place you'd rather be
Is all you can say as you
Open the door to leave
Me one more time wonderin' why
On one more lonely night, yeah yeah
Maybe I put on you

I just can't see them through
Each time we climb to the top
Then we drop & we're in a crazy situation
Caught up in a habit we just gotta let go
No more going back

Heart,"There I was with the old man
Stranded again so off I'd ran
A young world crashing around me
No possibilities of getting what I need
He looked at me and smiled
Said no, no, no, no, no child

See the dog and butterfly
Up in the air he likes to fly
Dog and butterfly
Below she had to try
She roll back down to the warm soft ground, laughing
She don't know why, she don't know why
Dog and butterfly

Well I stumbled upon your secret place
Safe in the trees you had tears on your face
Wrestling with your desires frozen strangers
Stealing your fires, the message hit my mind
Only words that I could find

See the dog and butterfly
Up in the air he like to fly
Dog and butterfly below she had to try
She roll back down to the warm soft ground
Laughing to the sky, up to the sky
Dog and butterfly

We're getting older the world's getting colder
For the life of me I don't know the reason why
Maybe it's livin' making us give in
Hearts rolling in taken back on the tide
We're balanced together ocean upon the sky

Another night in this strange town
Moonlight holding me light as down
Voice of confusion inside of me
Just begging to go back where I'm free
Feels like I'm through
Then the old man's words are true

See the dog and butterfly
Up in the air he like to fly
Dog and butterfly, below she had to try
She roll back down to the warm soft ground
With a little tear in her eye
She had to try, she had to try
Dog and butterfly, yeah

Up in the air he like to fly
The dog and butterfly, below she had to try
She roll back down to the warm soft ground, laughing
She don't know why

But no one ever moved me like the way you do
And held against you, love I am weak, oh yeah

A butterfly risin' from the flame

Make my sails fill

A song could get us free
Slept behind the altar

Stealing an hour, buying a night
It`s hard on the telephone

Is the song still in your ear
Were we only high
Just the wine
Only the times

When we`re old
How will the story be told
Windswept smoke used by time
Waiting for the bus
Will that be us?

When the salesman came to call
Selling our soul to buy
Sometimes it ain`t no deal at all

Princess dressed in wool, dreaming eyes, whispering her rhymes

Shining prince inside my head, 
Live inside a palace underneath my bed

Shine down on me satin queen, overlords of insane scenes
They go dancing cross the pages of the magazine

Typewriter steel and gray, work away, everybody`s going home
Over across town, caught in a crowd, still living alone
Little room for her out of the rain
A little something for the pain
Lady-in-waiting potentially for the lord of the rock `n roll aristocracy
Dreaming in photographs at night, love`s like sand held in your hand so tight

And everybody know who they are in a velvet garden of rhinestone stars
Shine down on me satin queen, overlords of insane scenes

Come in tired and lock the door

Heart,"Hey darlin', darlin', gonna say it true
No one understands me like you do
I got the story when I was a child
I took me over and turned me wild
Only to make it true

But when I'm alone, all alone
No one home, the TV and the phone
Still say it will rain today
Okay

Hey darlin', darlin', help me to understand
What went wrong with the peaceful plan
Was it bold

I ain't wishing for what used to be
I only hope that you and me
Can keep hold, unsold

When you got no history, you're free
You sing and you believe so strong
You hold out fast and long, so long

Now the latest is the greatest is their plan
But they didn't make us and they can't break us
Darlin', darlin', I don't think they can

Heart,"Wake up love, wake up babe
I wanna tell you, let me say
Dreaming never looked so true
One word ain't enough
Heaven's finding eyes in you
How can I say love?

Many smilers lie to each other, oh
Children hide with pretty words, oh
So many times we seem to find
Children play too rough
Never too late for what we are made for
How can I say love?

All this feeling here inside
One word ain't enough
The way to say it seems to hide
How can I say love?

How do we wind up?
Why do we wind up so alone?
How many roads do we gotta travel on
Till we find out we're already home?
Already home

All this feeling here inside
One word ain't enough
The way to say it seems to hide
How can I say love?

Heart,"How are you?
You can start anytime

Got an appointment to keep for seven nights I couldn't sleep
I'm in a state of disbelief it's my big chance on magic street
I followed this fashion doll down the famous hall
""Ginger won't be long at all"", she said, ""Take a number, you'll be called""

I said, ""I'm gonna show him what I can do
Now it's just between us two""
In the grand tradition, private audition
I said, ""I'm gonna show him what I can do
And now it's just between us two""
In the grand tradition, private audition, yeah

Wish I knew then, what I know now

I don't know what I did wrong I thought I really laid it on
But when he called out for some more, I gave him my standard encore
I gave him the Swanee River the good ship Rockin' Rye
The Stars and Stripes Forever and the good old pal of mine
But that ain't what he was on about, he was casting for his couch

He said, ""Come baby, show me what you can do
And now it's just between us two""
In the grand tradition, private audition

Heart,"Go to the city away from the land, stand in a line
Where they stamp your hand, wind up at a dance
You want to energize, is it just by chance?
People have electric eyes

Wires and strings, line that lead to power supplies
Games read green on table screens, charged and powered
Mediaized, we are channeled, we are hypnotized

Wake up, shake up the situation
Hold on, help the situation
Human condition, so extreme
You can see it feeding the new machine

There is still a dream, our humanity, hero rebels die
Leaving us the key
Wake up, shake up the situation
Hold on, help the situation

Recognize something good
Even try to take it if they could

Baby it can't be this again

Heart,"Young girl feeling pretty old
Young girl in the band
Rolling into another town
Living the best they can

Across the street, a music store
She gotta find a brand new axe
And there he was, that blue guitar
He was staring her right back, staring her right back

She held him close and he felt just fine
He warmed her up, she know he was just right
Together they cut right through the night

She made herself a local scene
And man that axe could sing and scream
Crying for a big breakthrough
Only small time local news

Just about to pack it in
Mr. Money Biz rolled in
Paid the way and broke the band
A living one night stand, living one night stand

She held him close and he felt just fine
He warmed her up, she know he was just right
Together they cut right through the night

Like touching fire
Like holding desire
Like touching fire
Like holding desire

Take this platinum, take this gold
Burn too hot, it turns you cold
Nothin' left to hold on to
But that guitar was always true, that man was always true

She held him close and he felt just fine
He warmed her up, she know he was just right
Together they cut right through the night

Like touching fire
Like holding desire
Like touching fire

Trouble's callin' down so heavy

It weighs on my mind

It's just like you to take it all so far
Then you feel abused
And wonder who you are

Can turn and run

Give it room, start an empty page
Get back in the game, do it your way
You don't have to play so heavy

I don't understand why you treat me that way

You had your own ways of makin' me pay

Then you took it just a little to far
Now I see you for what you are
I don't need the heartache anymore

Lovin' you was an endless fight
I was wrong and you were always right
But look what happened when I called your bluff
When the truth comes out
You aint' so tough - no

You turned me into an emotional prisoner
You hit me with words that cut to the bone - oh
Then you kissed me and made me believe that I needed you
And think I could never survive on my own - oh no

Never thought that I would break away
Now I see right through your power play
And I don't feel so helpless after all

Lovin' you was an endless fight

Heart,"It was a rainy night when he came into sight
Standing by the road, no umbrella, no coat
So I pulled up along side and I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile so we drove for a while
I didn't ask him his name, this lonely boy in the rain
Fate tell me it's right, is this love at first sight
Please don't make it wrong, just stay for the night
All I want to do is make love to you
Say you will you want me too
All I want to do is make love to you
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to

So we found this hotel, it was a place I knew well
We made magic that night. Oh, he did everything right
He brought the woman out of me, so many times, easily
And in the morning when he woke all I left him was a note
I told him I am the flower you are the seed
We walked in the garden we planted a tree
Don't try to find me, please don't you dare
Just live in my memory, you'll always be there

All I want to do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All want to do is make love to you
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to

Oh, oooh, we made love
Love like strangers
All night long
We made love

Then it happened one day, we came round the same way
You can imagine his surprise when he saw his own eyes
I said please, please understand
I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me
was the one little thing that you can

All I want to do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I want to do is make love to you
Come on, say you will, you want me too

Feels like time is standing still since you went away
Always thought you'd stay forever, always thought that you'd be here

Days crawl by, I keep wishing they'd be over

Heart,"Stand at the window
Pull back the lace
I feel the night wind on my face
All that I long for - all that I crave
Am I master, Am I slave?
The night's so still 
I feel the lovers out in the hills
The breathing of young girls lying in bed
Visions of love in their heads
Desire walks on
Desire walks on
A beautiful boy gazed in a pool
His eyes looking back like jewels
The call of the mirror - too strong to resist
The call of the water - the call of a kiss
Desire walks on
Desire walks on
It wants to be held - possessed
It wants consummation
It moves on obsessed
Bloodstream through pipes
Singing in the wires
Heat - motion - control 
Desire walks on
Stand at the window
The world is so still
Calling you back by force of will
Where did you go?
I don't know why
Too much longing inside
You wrapped me in nighttime sexual disguise
I was the love in your eyes
You took me over
My innocence cracked
You own my passion
I want you back

We are sworn enemies
And the lonely beating of my heart tonight is only one more thing

Then I get to thinking maybe, maybe too much thinking's bad

In walks the night
In walks my fantasy
Darkness all around me
And I'm dying for the light

I reach down for a little strength deep inside
Well I know I love my freedom, but lonely feelings come and go
And night time is a season
Feel the cold wind blow

And I toss and I turn and I walk the floor
I don't want to cry don't want to cry no more
Here I go again the night just walked in

If only these eyes could see through all the emptiness I found around me
In walks the night

I can almost feel you in the darkness all around
Still I'm waiting for the break of day
Waiting for a miracle a dream that won't wander away

It spares not even me till the harm is done

From your sleep!
Ah gentle romancers drink of Love
So sweet!""

Deepens dark their dream

Not sparkling now?""

Make no foolish fight

Through the Night!""

No pain
A hard racy game of give and take
Leaves them dazed, half crazed, in her wake

She roll back down to the warm soft ground

Through the pyramids of light
I would feed myself on silence

Heart,"Spare a little candle
Save some light for me
Figures up ahead
Moving in the trees
White skin in linen
Perfume on my wrist
And the full moon that hangs over
These dreams in the mist

Darkness on the edge
Shadows where I stand
I search for the time
On a watch with no hands
I want to see you clearly
Come closer than this
But all I remember
Are the dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

Is it cloak 'n' dagger
Could it be spring or fall
I walk without a cut
Through a stained glass wall
Weaker in my eyesight
The candle in my grip
And words that have no form
Are falling from my lips

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

There's something out there
I can't resist
I need to hide away from the pain
There's something out there
I can't resist

The sweetest song is silence
That I've ever heard
Funny how your feet
In dreams never touch the earth
In a wood full of princes
Freedom is a kiss
But the prince hides his face
From dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away",These Dreams

I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending and that's all I can do

Heart,"We walked away before, there were too many storms
We could not get through, but I still kept loving you
Now fate brought you back to me, this time I won't let you leave
I'm holding on to you, forever, I'm never letting go

The time I spent away from you, was time that made me see
I need to live my life with you, I need you here with me

And it would take a strong, strong wind to take me from your arms again
To take me from your side
It would take a strong, strong wind to pull away this heart of mine
To make us break apart this time, it would take a strong, strong wind

Hearts sometimes lose their way, but they find their way back someday
To the arms they need and I need you like the air I breathe
The time I spent away from you was time lost in the rain
I'm meant to live my life with you, that's something nothing can change

It would take a strong, strong wind to take me from your arms again
To take me from your side
It would take a strong, strong wind to tear away this heart of mine
Make us break apart this time, yeah, it would take a strong, strong wind

This time I'm holding on with everything
This time I won't let go for anything

And it would take a strong, strong wind to take me from your arms again
To take me from your side

The answer may not be in black and white

So baby surrender to me
There´ll be no holding back now
So baby surrender to me tonight

If this is how it´s going to be, I´ll walk away

Let´s forget about the past and who´s to blame
´Cause when this is all gone
We´ll wish we´d held on

So baby surrender to me
There´ll be no holding back now
So baby surrender to me tonight

To think that fate could make us strangers

I cannot give you My fortune's set in stone

How beautiful, how beautiful The candle in the window It dances and it swirls

'Bout a star in the sky on a beautiful night 
And the shepherds and cattle alone in his light

Born is the king of Israel Little stockings hung with care 
Hoping Santa will be there Little footsteps on the roof 
Down the chimney there's your proof there's your proof

The ring wraiths ride in black

Sing as you raise your bow

That lights the face so cold

When you're lying here in my arms

There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
Now nothing can take you away from me

We've been down that road before

There's a lot that I could say
But just hold me now

On a watch with no hands

Through a stained glass wall
Weaker in my eyesight
The candle in my grip
And words that have no form
Are falling from my lips

What if the tire should blow
What if my soul should slip off this bus

A rusted old home on the range

When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

Who know where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way
All the way",All the Way
Heart of the City Worship Band,"Some kids have it, some kids don't
I was eleven when I was signed
I was on the CMA's and
Y'all thought that Vince Gill sang high

Then puberty played a trick on me
A few mustache hairs
A change occurred
My voice matured

My first single did so good
I bought bikes for all my friends at school
A little something for mom and dad
Like an in-ground swimming pool

Look at this pimple
Oh, man it hurts
The sweetest voice you'd ever heard
'Till my voice matured

My voice, my high pitched voice
It just went away
It happens to all boys
It keeps changing every single day

I bet nobody thought
I'd go overnight from soprano to bass
Now all of my hits are too high
For me to sing all the way

I need some help, it sounds absurd
I used to sing just like a girl
But my voice matured

My loss is like an ocean blue, so cold and insecure
She said indefinite time apart heaven knows we need it
Then tore my world in hemispheres, but I still want her half

Three weeks ago she left, she left but casts her shadows still
I've told myself I'm not selfish but my hearts not had its fill
She said indefinite times apart heaven knows we need it
My heart it grieves, it begs for reasons why, why, why

And to cure my name, such is a trait of retrospect

Become the richest man on earth before despair?

And now my mind set I'll be rowdy through the death
Due us part on love rock crew right here in heart

My whole crew bent a half a hunned gone spit
Chocolate tay true dat yo who him who dat
Snatchin' up da ""L"" like a snipher

If you ever tryta hog up the ""L"" again
Last one to put in first son to dig in
Now I hear you riffin' me while I'm countin' your toke
The henloke burns my throat with no jaser
I'm feelin vibes by my hip from the black pager
Blowin' up for da nine four for da nine five
For da nine square either way say word word

To the most def no quest all glock down

He's happy to have a bail check like so these A & are is used to
But man I got heart like Rosa Parks
And I stay makin records with true MC's like Freddie Foxxx
Send comitees send somebody to tell me I won't tell
Cause I ain't got silicones, too much fire up in me
So future like izelja got my X got my backs

And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.

Come on ev'rybody, I say now  let's play a game.
I betcha I can make a rhyme out of anybody's name.
The first letter of the name,
I treat it like it wasn't there,
But a ""B"" or an ""F""  or an ""M"" will appear;
And then I say ""Bo"" add a ""B"" then I say the name.
Then ""Bo-na-na fanna"" and ""fo""
And then I say the name again with an """"f"" very plain,
Then  ""fee fi"" and a ""mo""
And then I say the name again with an ""M"" this time.
And there isn't any name that I can't rhyme.
 
Arnold! Arnold, Arnold bo-bar-nold, 
Bo-na-na, fanna fo-far-nold, 
Fee fi m-mar-mold. Arnold!
 
But if the first two letters are ever the same,
Crop them both, then say the name.
Like Bob, Bob, drop the ""B's"", Bo-ob.
Or Fred, Fred, drop the ""F's"", Fo-red, 
Or Mary, Mary, drop the ""M's"", Mo-ary.
That's the only rule that is contrary.
 
And then I say ""Bo"" add a ""B"" then I say the name.
Then ""Bo-na-na fanna"" and ""fo""
And then I say the name again with an """"f"" very plain,
Then  ""fee fi"" and a ""mo""
And then I say the name again with an ""M"" this time.
And there isn't any name that I can't rhyme.

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

That I wouldn't stick around

Yet here I am, so confused
How am I supposed to leave
When I can't even move
In the time it would've took to say
?Honey I'm home, how was your day'
You dropped a bomb right where we live
And expected me to just forgive?

Well, that's a mighty big word
For such a small man
And I'm not sure I can

So get you some things and get out
Don't call me for a day or two
So I can sort this out
Well you might as well've ripped the life
Right out of me right here tonight

?Can you ever just forgive?'

Who should wear your ring

Can you tell me I'm not the one
To be the mother of your unborn son
May not have the tie but there's no denyin that you feel the same
Cause I've always been your girl

And don't you dare say it's too late

So you say
Somehow I know it's not quite that way

It's getting pretty late
And you haven't checked on me all day
When I called you didn't answer
Now I'm feelin' like you're ignorin' me

I wish that you were home
Holdin' me tight in your arms
And I wish I could go back
To the day before we met
And skip my regret

I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me

No, you don't deserve me

Wasted my time thinkin' 'bout you
And you ain't never gon' change
I wish I wasn't in love with you
So I wouldn't feel this way

When you touch me my heart melts
(And anything you did wrong I forgive) Yeah, yeah
So you play me and take advantage
Of the love that I feel for you

Why you wanna hurt me so bad
I believed in you that's why I'm so mad
Now I'm drowning in disappointment
And it's hard for me to even look at you

I wish that you were home, oh, yes, I do
Holdin' me tight in your arms, ooh, baby
And I wish I could go back

So I wouldn't feel this way (I wouldn't feel this way)

Said you care about me, but from what I see
I ain't feelin' that, so I disagree
Gave you all my love and understanding
And you treated me like your enemy

So leave me alone, don't bother to follow me
Now just go back where you came from
This house is no longer your home
You are not welcome no, no, no more, no more

change, never gonna change)

So I wouldn't feel this way

I wish I wasn't in love with you

bad)

with you)

I'm wonderin' should I let you in
I open up the door and see
The flowers for me, so beautiful in your hand
You start beggin' me to take you back

Kiss me like ya used to 
Tell me what ya used to
Say you don't miss me, baby, like ya used to

Maybe your too used to me

Yesterday I wore my favorite jeans 
The ones you love to see on me
But you didn't even give a second look
Buess someone else had your attention took
Even did my hair in a brand new style 
To see if a change would bring a smile
And I might as well have stayed the same
Cause you still didn't say a than

And realize that we're just different
I understand that if I be me and you be you
We know love will pull us through
Understand the nature of a man

I understand
I'll be there for you
Baby, through and through
I'll be your candied yams
You know I love you, Boo
I'm not tryin' to be the man
Nah, ain't got that kinda nerve
Ain't tryin' to role reverse
I know I wear the purse
To me it's not about control
That's not what I want
It's your love I want 
And from you I want
All the little character flaws 
It's one of nature's laws
From the beginning of time

[Chorus]

You're the creamy part
Of my chocolate star
That's what you are
You stole my heart
The fragrance of my melody
I can't describe what you are to me
My baby, my baby
You do that thing for me

Heather Headley,"This is for my sisters
And all my sister girls
Um 
Yeah
She was 5 foot 9
If she didn't wear shoes
Body like a goddess
Walk by her own rules
Reigned supreme over her ghetto kingdom
Possessed intellectual wisdom
Any man she met wanted a piece of her
Bought her fine things in hopes to creep with her
Talked like 25
Looked like 23
Who could believe the sistas only 14

Cross Your Legs

You're Only 14
In retrospect he wasn't really her type
But he was tall with big hands and the sexiest eyes
So she fell for him and in the blink of an eye
He became part of her for the rest of her life
Four months later considering her plight
Belly's gettin' bigger she saw the plus sign
So she she calls him up hoping he'll ease her pain

Heather Headley,"How you goin' let that girl get between us baby?
Do you even know her name? 
How am I supposed to make it through to you?

[Chorus]
Is Sunday goin' be my day to take it easy (Make it all about me)
Maybe on Monday think about calling
Maybe Tuesday we'll see how I feel
Sunday goin' be ma day to take it easy (And make it all about me)
Maybe on Monday think about calling
Maybe Tuesday, we'll see how I feel

It's 9:30 in the mornin', 
I didn't sleep well again
Tossed all night long boy
Can't stand it when we fight like this 
Here we go again so I have to be gone

Can't deal with the fallout
Gonna take a time out
I need to take the day off
Gonna gather my thoughts, gather myself
I need some time without you, without you

[Chorus]

Maybe I'll just take a walk 
A few blocks get a bite to eat
See a movie (but not a love story)
Try to get in the key, listen to some Stevie
What I need to do is go to church 

And pray for that girl that got between us
Pray that I don't see her 
Pray that I don't meet her
Pray that I don't try to beat her

[Chorus]

What she says and what she does 
Ain't no concern to me
She don't really need to be 
All up in ma business

Baby you didn't really take the time 
To talk to me 
You played me and betrayed me

Heather Headley,"There's a time I felt I was blessed To be loved by you 
But those blessings turn to regret from all the things you put me through
I remember at night you used to hold me till the sun rose the next day
Now you sleep and just turn away while my heart is on display
And I say

[Chorus: x2]
Why should I cry one more night?
Why should I smile when it hurts inside?
Why does my heart say, get up and walk away
Why do I stay?
Why, why, why

There's a reason why I cry every day
There's a reason why things don't go your way
There's a reason why I kneel down in pray
There's a reason why I'm still around today
Can't you see that I'm hurtin' eternally?
I need affection and good Lord therapy
I need you know as an urgent delivery
To get rid of the pain inside of me

[Chorus: x2]

Why should I put up lies?
Am I afraid to say goodbye?
I've loved you so, baby I can't deny
But now it's time to dry my eyes
It's Hard to think of what was changed when I feel like it was all in vain
Can't be right and feel this wrong
This heart of mine is just

[Chorus: x3]",Why Should I Cry
Heather Headley,"I'm laying here in my bed, staring at the ceiling
Imagining that you're here, holding me,
See to have your heart in my possession would mean everything,
But would you rather live loveless, or will you live for me and . . .

[Chorus]
What would you give, and
What would it take, for
You to show me, that, I'm worth all the love
Every tear
Will you fight for me until you win
I need to know
Am I worth it?

Now I wanna' give you my all, but I don't know if it's too soon,
See the heart doesn't understand time, it just does what it wants to
See to have your heart in my possession would mean everything
But would you rather live loveless or would you live for me and . . .

[Chorus]

Would you climb the highest mountain?
Would you swim the deepest sea?
Would you put your life on the line?
I need to know, would you do this for me?
Am I worth the late night phone call?
When you really wanna' be asleep
Am I worth you giving it your all?
'Cause you're worth it to me

[Chorus]",Am I Worth It
Heather Headley,"I got a song in my heart
Let me start with I'm over you
Still it can't hurt me to say very plain . . . I think about you
And the laughs and the jokes and the times that I shared with you.
I got this feeling for reminiscing
Wanted to take that trip down memory lane
But what is missing, is that you're not here to sit down with me
So I'm thinking these beautiful things all by myself.
And what's on my mind is

[Chorus]
Back when it was
Simple as breathing
Just the two of us
We were happy together it was
Easy to be in
Our relationship,
You remember when
You used to say you loved me so
Promised one time to never go away
And now you're gone

The smile that you left me with, is the same smile I've kept on wearing
The smile's not so much tied to you
More tied to what we spent sharing
Simple little things
But it was all those simple little things that pleased me the most...
Need I remind you 'bout the good times baby
There were good times from the start
Good times in my heart
A heart that never lied
Remember back in '99.
When we snuck into the neighbor's pool and went for a dip
There were good times in the rain
Good times everyday
Good times Heaven knows
Remember that dirty little joke
Made us laugh all night long.

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The joy you left me with, nothing stronger since
What we did together
I ain't felt nothing better since that time
Those were the days
The nights
The minutes
The seconds
That you were mine

[Chorus]",Back When It Was
Heather Headley,"I tried so many times but nothing happened,
It seemed the task at hand was much too great for me.
I spent my yesterdays wondering if tomorrow would be the same.
I underestimated Your grace.
But you loved me in spite of my ways
And changed me.

[Chorus]
Change
That's the word that comes to mind when I think of all you've done for me.
Oh, oh, change
It's kinda' strange how people say that I act so differently
Oh, oh change
Every passing day I find it easier to say:
""What a wonderful change in me.""

Now I find myself staring in the mirror
Taking inventory of the things I see.
I never realized that there was so much missing deep inside
Until you took control of my life.
Like an eagle now I can fly
Cause you changed me.

[Chorus]

And everyday I pray that you'll open my eyes to see things your way
Cause I wanna love like you,
Walk like you,
Live like you.
Whatever you have to do
Even if you change me Lord.

[Chorus]",Change
Heather Headley,"I gotta' lotta' things to share with you boy
I'm checking for ya', call me baby sometime, I'll tell it to ya
I'm feelin' all this chemistry between you and me
I can't sleep at night I toss and turn and turn
Lookin' for ya' dreams of you by my side, I'm talking to ya

What's this
what's this
I feel
I feel
I'm curious, 'gotta see

[Chorus]
How many ways can I show you how I feel
Let you know my love is real
I'll be the girl for you I will 
Give you all of me
I wanna' hear how it sounds when you say my name
Boy for that I'll do anything
And if you need or you want for more
Tell me how many ways

I'm waiting for the day, you say to me, tellin' me
I'm the one you need and you'll always take care of me
And you take me by the hand and tell me 'Baby it's alright, its okay'
Then you and me can finally live out all our fantasies
Layin' on the beach - fall asleep in the West Indies
Listenin' to sounds of pleasure

[Chorus: x2]",How Many Ways
Heather Headley,"It's bordering on insanity
So blurred
So unclear
Then suddenly eyes focus and realize that
This man should not be here
It's funny how there's no remorse in the moment
But after it's over you wish you could disown it
And as you get up to tell this stranger to leave
The love of your life walks in and sees, everything

[Chorus]
And of all the things that you could have said
What was in your head?
I didn't mean to
All the thoughts running through your mind
All that you could find
I didn't mean to
And the pain of losing everything comes over you
I didn't mean to
All you can say is that 'you didn't mean to'
I didn't mean to

And it's reality now
Pictures of him and your baby
Smashed in broken glass all on the floor
With his suitcase in one hand, your little girl's hand in the other
You hear him say ""Mommy don't live us no more""
And it cuts like a knife but you can't blame him either
You're a mother, you're a wife, but you're also a cheater
Ooh girl, one silly moment of lust
Just cost you everything that you've ever loved

[Chorus]

Oh, the clouds are rolling in
As you prepare to face this punishment and suffer the consequence
Such a price to pay
Was it really worth it?
And you fight back tears
As you watch him take the only thing you ever truly loved away
The tears in her eyes as she waves goodbye
Slowly kills you inside

[Chorus]",I Didn't Mean To
Heather Headley,"Imagine seeing him on the town,
Holding another hand.
She's starin' me down,
So I figure that he told her who I am.
But it don't matter either way,
What they do or say cause ain't nothin' changed.
He's standing with her, but his soul is calling out my name.

In my mind, I'll always be his lady.
In my mind, I'll always be his girl.

Saw his momma just the other day,
Said he'd been through a spell.
Had a bad break up, thinks he's on his way up, it's hard to tell.
She said I think it'd do some good if you called him every now and then.
You see he's been through some things and I'm thinking he could really use a friend.

In my mind, I'll always be his lady.
In my mind, I'll always be his girl.
Only time can tell if I'm his lady.
But in my mind, I'll always be his girl.

They say if you love something, you've got to let it go.
And if it comes back, then it means so much more.
Fine if it never does, at least you will know,
That it was something you had to go through to grow.

In my mind, I'll always be his lady.
In my mind, I'll always be his girl.
Only time will tell if I'm his lady.
But in my mind, I'll always be his girl.

Always feel this way about ya,
Always be your lady,
In my heart, in my mind.
In my heart, in my mind.
In my soul, in my mind.
Baby you should know,
You're in my thoughts, in my mind.
You're in my prayers, in my mind.
I'll always keep you there.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.",In My Mind
Heather Headley,"At first I wrote it ""dear you,"" then it turned,
""to whom it may concern.""
I began it in this way because
I needed to express through these words,
How deeply I was hurt,
And how distant from you I now was.
I wrote ""normally I would say
These words to your face,
But this time that I just can't do,
Cause I know the way you been movin'
And the things you been doin'
And right now I can't stand the sight of you.""

So this is my goodbye
This means we are not together
This means that you're free,
See who you wanna' see, and me,
Well I know I can do better
So this is my goodbye
This makes it official, you've lost me forever
We are now the past, and it's kinda sad
That you had to read it in this letter
This is my goodbye

By the time you finish this
I'll be gone for good, your lesson learned.
Where it is I'll be, and who's lovin' me,
Sorry baby, that's no longer your concern.
And tell your lil' friend she'll be in my prayers,
Cause just having to deal with you
Is enough to break your soul.
I just hope she knows exactly
What it is she's getting into.

So this is my goodbye
This means we are not together
This means that you're free,
See who you wanna' see, and me,
Well I know I can do better
So this is my goodbye
This makes it official, you've lost me forever
We are now the past, and it's kinda sad
That you had to read it in this letter
This is my goodbye

Not that it matters to you,
But I wrote this with clear and dry eyes.
The years of being mistreated by you,
I've cried all the tears I can cry.
So this is the end, done and over with.
Believe me when I say that you won't be missed.
No hug, no kiss, signed sincerely.
P.S. Forget you ever knew me.

So this is my goodbye
This means we are not together
This means that you're free,
See who you wanna' see, and me,
Well I know I can do better
So this is my goodbye
This makes it official, you've lost me forever
We are now the past, and it's kinda sad
That you had to read it in this letter
This is my goodbye",The Letter
Heather Headley,"I used to think that you were heaven sent
'Cause you appeared to be the perfect gentleman
You would open doors and make those daily calls
Just to check and see if I needed anything at all
You used to be concerned
Then things changed suddenly
And when something went wrong
You were never there to see
When I would tell you that I need comforting
You would tell me you were kickin' it with Ray and them

[Chorus]
Losing you had to be
The best thing that ever happened to me
Even though I cried a little and I tried a little
I learned what a good woman really needs
Losing you had to be
The best thing that ever happened to me
Now that I'm over the pain, I found love again
With a man that makes me so happy

You would get mad at me over stupid things
Now why would I be going through 
The pockets of your jeans
I had suspicions and I felt 
Something was goin' on
You blame me for cheatin'
But it was you doin' something wrong
They say that guilt will break ya down
And lately you've been calling 
But it's too late now
And I just wanna thank you
For leaving when you did
'Cause I never would of fell in love with him

[Chorus]

Thank you for the silly arguments
You made me realize
And the times you tried
To kill my self-confidence
Now I know the reason why
I appreciate you leaving me when you did
'Cause you made me understand
'Cause I never would of saw

Heather Headley,"All things being equal
I always put you first
You know that I've been down for you
Through better and through worse
All things being equal
Boy, I've been more than cool
So it seems only natural
To expect the same of you
Now, I'm not trying to start nothing
I like things drama free
But there won't be nothing to stop
If you keep sweatin' me
Sometimes a girl just needs her space
No different than her man
If I don't care that you do you
Why can't you deal with this?

[Chorus]
I need some me time
Not some you and some I
Just some me time, oh
I need some she time
Not some him and some her
Just some free time, oh
I wanna run with my girls
Hit the club, hit the mall
Get my nails and hair done
Spend a day at the spa
Boy, you ain't gotta worry
There ain't nothin' goin' on
I need some me time
That's all, and that's all

All things being equal
You're not the only one
If I wanted to roll like that
I could have anyone I want
All things being equal
I got a right to choose
The only thing you need to know
My choice is always you
Now, I'm not tryin' to flip on you
Or make a mess of things
But if I put trust in you
Then you should do the same
I'm not goin' anyplace
I'm not goin' anywhere
So you gotta' be actin' all scared

You're the most important thing in the world to me
Can't you get it through your head?
I ain't never gonna leave you, I ain't about to
Baby, don't you understand how much I love you?
I'm not deserving of your doubt and lack of trust for me

You didn't think I would let down my guard

See you've stayed away a day too late

You said 'baby I'm tired'
Must have been tired of me cause you left me hangin'

So I think I'm hearing what's not being said

I think I'm hearing what's not being said

You said, but now its time for show and tell
Sent me a letter saying you still care
You say you ain't in love with no one else
And now I'm living everyday blaming my self
So if you have a reason 
And you ain't speaking up
Why can't you just be a man 
And tell me I ain't good enough
No I wasn't dreaming
I know some days things got rough
You must have been tired of me 
To just leave me hanging

What you're saying to me I don't want to believe
I translated your language to find out what you mean

Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'

I'd give you the world, but actually what would that do.
I'd promise you wings to fly, but how would you ever learn to run,
So I wish you all you need, to be more than I can be.
This is what I wish for you.

I wish you rainy days, so you can know the beauty of a clear blue sky
I wish you falling leaves, so you'll understand that seasons change.
Cause, if I gave you the mountains, would you learn to climb,
I pray you'll always see; the forest through the trees.
And this is what I wish for you,
And this is what I wish for you.

If I could I'd say the word and take your fears away,
And I'd stay right by your side and show the way you should take.
But this your life, this is your story, and we know this, go ahead and say,
I hope you live with no regrets.

I wish you ocean breeze, and rivers that can bring you everything you dream,
I wish that the air you breathe, is all that you'll ever need.
And I wish you nights of love, and days of joy and shoulders when you cry,
And just enough hellos, to get you through, goodbye,
And this is what I wish for you.

I pray one day you'll have a home, with arms stood open wide,
And you'll have someone who loves you, always by your side,
And if you lose your will to try, I wish you wings to fly.
I wish you wings to fly.

I wish you everything you need.

Heather Headley,"Looking for an answer, trying to turn the page but
Always holding onto the past
I built these walls around me, but somehow you have found me
Now I know a joy that will last
And in this love you gave amazing grace
And healed my broken soul
And from your mighty throne you held me close
Made this wounded whole

You could write a note across the sky
And make heaven testify cause you are awesome
And you could make the mountains shout Your name
While the angels sing your praise
So I wonder how an extraordinary God
Could love an ordinary me
I'll never understand it, how your love has set me free

How can the King of Glory care so much about me?
That You would choose to give up Your life
With every changing season, You love me without reason
Everything I have You provide
I fall on my knees and give you praise, I worship You alone
You are the only God, the highest power,
I live to make You known

You could write a note across the sky
And make heaven testify cause You are awesome
And You could make the mountains shout Your name
While the angels sing your praise
So I wonder how an extraordinary God
Could love an ordinary me

And though I don't deserve
This gift of mercy and abounding grace
You blessed me with it anyway
I'm not ashamed to tell the world about Ya
That You're more than enough for an ordinary girl like me

You could write a note across the sky
And make heaven testify cause You are awesome
And You could make the mountains shout Your name
While the angels sing your praise
So I say that an extraordinary God
He loves an ordinary me",Ordinary Me
Heather Headley,"Oh, to see the dawn
Of the darkest day,
Christ on the road to Calvary.
Tried by sinful men,
Torn and beaten, then
Nailed to a cross of wood.

[Chorus]
This, the power of the cross,
Christ became sin for us
Took the blame, bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross.

Oh, to see the pain
Written on Your face,
Bearing the awesome weight of sin.
Every bitter thought,
Every evil deed
Crowning Your bloodstained brow.

Now the daylight flees
Now the ground beneath
Quakes as its Maker bows His head.
Curtain torn in two,
Dead are raised to life,
""Finished!"" the victory cry.

Oh, to see my name
Written in the wounds,
For through Your suffering I am free.
Death is crushed to death
Life is mine to live,
Won through Your selfless love.

This, the power of the cross
Son of God?slain for us
What a love! What a cost!

We stand forgiven at the cross.",Power of the Cross
Heather Headley,"I have always been a fan of Commissioned, and this song, has long been one of my favorites. 
So, when we started the project, it was the first cover we thought of and worked on. 
It's also such a great view of our ""prodigal son/daughter"" relationship with Christ.

How can you forgive me when I've often gone astray
How can you think of me when I do things my way
Turning my back from you
The one who loved me first
Having my own desires
Renewing worldly thirst

You told me you loved me and I should make up my mind
You tell me come back now, but I keep wasting time
Feeling so very weak you say I can be strong
I feel I've gone too far you tell me to come home
You love me still
And I know this is real

[Chorus]
And I am running back to you
I see you're standing there for me
Your arms are opened wide
And I don't have to cry no more
You're standing there for me
And I am running back to you,
Why do I go away when I know I am no good when I'm on my own.

You told me you could keep me, but I've turned it away
I failed you so much now I don't know what to say
Using the same excuse that I am just a man
You tell me you've been there and hold your nail scarred hands so I can see
Now I know I am free

[Chorus]

You're standing there for me and I am running back to you,
Why do I go away when I know I am no good when I'm on my own.

I have taken advantage of your love and grace
Forgive me Lord and take me home, take me home.
I'm running to you Jesus please take me home,
You see I'm tired of pain and I don't like fear but Lord I want to be more sincere.
And I am running back to you
I see you're standing there for me
Your arms are opened wide
And I don't have to cry no more
You're standing there for me
And I am running back to you,
I never should have left your side

Heather Headley,"I am a Christian
Do you know what that means?
Means I'm far from perfect

I was bought with a purpose
Purchased by love
It's not a form of religion
But a gift from above
I am not perfect
I have been redeemed

I am a believer
Do you know what that means?
Means I've pledged my life
Gave Him everything
And just to think 
He loves someone like me
I am not perfect
But I have been redeemed

Redeemed
While I was yet in my transgressions
Somebody paid the price for me
I offered up my life to Him
And now I say again
I am not perfect
Simply redeemed

I am your sister
Let me show you the way
We'll walk this road together
Take it day by day
By faith I know we'll make this journey's end
Make no mistake about it

You have been redeemed
Redeemed
While you were yet in your transgressions
Jesus, He died set you free
So offer up your life to Him
Accept this gift and we'll begin
To walk together

I have been redeemed
While we yet in our transgressions
Jesus He died for you and me
So offer up your life to Him
Accept His love, and then begin
To walk together hand in hand
Then surely He will heal our land
And on that day He comes again
And we will find our rest in Him
Then we'll be perfect

Drifting like the clouds above.
And who was I before I knew your name?
A song without a melody,
A road without a destiny.
And how could I have ever known you’d touch me
And I’ll never be the same.

The world is open to me, now,
With you I feel the solid ground beneath me
All because you need me.
And now my life is in your hands,
You gave my heart a second chance to beat,
All because you need me.

I’ve always had this love to give,
But never had a strength within
To be great enough to love with all I am.
You saved me from a wasted night,
You tell me that I saved your life,
A flower crawling for the rain,
I said a prayer for you and then you came.

Heather Headley,"What me and my girls plan to do was hang around,
Have fun, girl talk, talk real loud.
Then I get approached by a man that probably didn’t know I demand respect,
All I wanna do is your offers necklace and brag about his big vet house in Texas,
So I told myself it’s time to make my exit, then he had the nerve to grab my arm and say

Hey mama, won’t you, won’t you,
Come here to bar, I won’t stop you.
Hey mama, come here, sit down,
Let me holla at you, got something for ya’
Hey mama, won’t you, won’t you,
Come here to bar, I won’t stop you.
Hey mama, come here, sit down,
Let me holla at you, got something for ya’

I feel like creeping myself, rolling my eyes, snapping my fingers, then I’ll be alive
He thinks I could be his extra on the side, he must be one of those guys
One of those guys that think I should be mesmerized by his car or I could be impressed so easily.
Instead of being strong and classy. You don’t know me.

Hey mama, won’t you, won’t you,
Come here to bar, I won’t stop you.
Hey mama, come here, sit down,
Let me holla at you, got something for ya’
Hey mama, won’t you, won’t you,
Come here to bar, I won’t stop you.
Hey mama, come here, sit down,
Let me holla at you, got something for ya’

I could’ve been yours so easily,
‘cause you’re the kind of guy to stay with me.
But you played yourself, try to tie that lie with someone else.
Not that kind of girl, who would come around you just because you called.
I need a man who can love me even without the little things he could get me.

Hey mama, won’t you, won’t you,
Come here to bar, I won’t stop you.
Hey mama, come here, sit down,
Let me holla at you, got something for ya’

If you play your cards right played,
Treat me like I wanna be treated,
Maybe one day I’ll sing you a little song
And say

Hey papa, won’t you come here to mama, I won’t stop you
Hey papa, come here, sit down, let me holla at you, got some for you.
Hey papa, won’t you, won’t you come here to mama, I won’t stop you.

Heather Headley,"Jesus, I don’t mean to bother You,
I’m sure You got better things You need to do.
But I’ve been real bad, but You already know that, don’t You?
And that that way ain’t easy.

I did some things wouldn’t have done to me,
Things that would make an ordinary man yell, fight and scream.
But no, no, not him, he just left without a scene,
That’s just a man he is.

And I understand why he set me free,
But I want him back home, so I’m begging You, please.
Jesus, you know I can’t live, live without him,
He’s more than I need.
Since he’s been gone I can’t breathe, breathe without him,
Have mercy on me.

You can work miracles, this I know,
I don’t care how You do it, just bring him back home.
Jesus, you know I believe You can bring him back to me,
You can bring him back to me.

I found myself more in a compromise,
But I never meant to hurt my angel.
And before you know it, I was telling lies,
That’s just the way it was.

I don’t know how I could ever go on,
I did my man harm and that day’s gone.

Jesus, you know I can’t live, live without him,
He’s more than I need.
Since he’s been gone I can’t breathe, breathe without him,
Have mercy on me.

If You walked on water and made that man see,
Then You got the power, make him come home to me.

Jesus, You know I believe You can bring him back to
These arms that will hold him
And love him like I know that I should.
Can You bring him back, cause I’m nothing without him.
I’m promise this time I’ll be good, I’ll be better than I can.

Jesus, you know I can’t live, live without him,
He’s more than I need.
Since he’s been gone I can’t breathe, breathe without him,
Have mercy on me.

You tell the winter to turn into spring,
You do it, if You tell him to love me again.

Jesus, You know I believe You can bring him back to me.
You can bring him back to me.

So listen, in the meantime,
I’ll be waiting by the door,
Sitting by the phone,
I’ll be right here until You bring my man back home.
Bring him home, back,
Bring him back to me.
You just bring him back.

You can walk on water, make blind men see,
Isn’t that hard, you can do this for me.
Bring him home, back,
You bring him home, back,
Bring him home, back,
I need You to tell him I’ll be real, real good
So, so, so, so good.
I’ll do anything.
I’m begging You, please, down on my knees,
I just want my man home.
I’ll stay on my knees.
Bring him home, back.
Back.",Bring Him Back
Heather Headley,"When I think of home I think of a place where there’s love overflowing
I wish I were home, I wish I was back here with the things I’ve been knowing.
And that makes the tall grass bend into leaning,
Suddenly the raindrops that fall have meaning.
Sprinkling the scene, makes it all clear.

Maybe there’s a chance for me to go back,
Now that I, I have some direction.
It sure would be nice for me to go back home
Where there’s love and affection.
And maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me the time I need in my life to grow up.
Time, be my friend, help me start again.

Suddenly the world’s gonna change its face
But still I, I’ll know where I’m going.
And I have had my mind spread around in space
And yet I, I’ve watched it growing.

And I whisper, God, please, don’t make it hard
To know the things we should believe.
Tell me, should we try instead, should we run away
Or is it better just to let things meet.

Living here, in this brand new world might be a fantasy
But it’s thought me a lot, so it’s real, it’s real, it’s real to me.
We must look inside our hearts to find
A world full of love, like yours, like mine.
I’m home.",Home
Heather Headley,"She had it all, but woke up one day
Find he was walking out with nothing left to say.
Just determined to live a life without her.

He left a note she couldn’t read
Blinded by tears, she felt she couldn’t breathe.
As she pondered she wondered what to do.

All I could say was
Give it just a little while, just a little while,
Things will get better.
Give it just a little while, just a little while,
The angels will do their thing.
Just a little while, just a little while,
You’ll feel like smiling again.

She cried the tears, picked up a laugh,
Still had to be a mother while she was not his wife.
As the years passed she prayed and asked and he answered.

And all I can say is
It’s only been a little while, just a little while
And it’s already better.
It’s only been a little while, just a little while,
See, the angels are doing their thing.
It’s been a little while, just a little while.

He may never apologize for the pain and broken heart,
But she’ll always remember how she loved him
And so the day she forgives him.

Now that she’s old she chooses to say
That she will not complain, but thank God for everything.
Now her kids are grown and went on their own, but makes her happy.
And deep in her heart she still thinks of him,
She wonders how he is and does he love her, still
In a simple way, she’s rebuild a life that’s lovely.

I just remind her,
I know it’s been a little while, just a little while,
But things sure got better.
I know it’s been a little while, just a little while,
The angels did their thing.
It’s been a little while and we’re all so much better.

Before I leave it all behind.
I gotta put you out of my mind.
This time, stop live in a lie.
I guess I’m damned to my last cry.

I was here, you owe a thing, guess we never could aquaint
Why the sun shines on you, I need some love to rain down on me.

For the very last time, I can’t even lie,
I know I gotta be strong, ‘cause life goes on and on.

This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still",What Is This Thing Called Love

Heather Nova,"Morning is almost here   let it wait 
I just want to lie here awhile  tempting fate 
I don't think I could breathe now with you gone 
But it's not weakness it's just something I've begun 

Maybe there's a light that's always on 
Maybe we're not only human  maybe 
Maybe there's a light that's always on 
And we're not only human 

When you're sleeping your ceramic 
You're surrounded by little stars 
Every shimmer is a searchlight 
Every planet is ours 

Change the street change the decade 
Still the longing's left inside 
But why am I too small to carry you? 
Why does twilight make me cry? 

Maybe there's a light that's always on 
Maybe we're not only human, maybe 
Maybe there's a light that's always on 
And we're not only human 

When all is said and done 
When all the weight is gone 
When all is said and done 
When all the weight is gone 
We're not only human 

Life is something set to music 
I can hear it when I'm sad 
There's a chord in every muscle 
Every kiss you ever had 
There's a power when you're near me 
In our heads or in our bones 
I know nothing but I'm guessing 
When we die we're not alone 

Maybe there's a light that's always on 
Maybe we're not only human, maybe 
Maybe there's a light that's always on

Everything spins so fast 
And the night's in a paper cup 
When you want it to last

One breath under the bridge of sighs 
Bending where the river bends

The world's on the table, I'm willing and able

The room, dark and narrow
I bloom down to the marrow
It's a beautiful storm
It comes with no warning at all

Into the flesh
Into the sorrow I fall now
Waves coming on
And I'm soaked and I'm torn
I'm blissed out and worn

It comes with no warning

And you stand in the shadows
The room, dark and narrow
I bloom down to the marrow
It's a beautiful storm
It comes with no warning

And I, how will I ever tell you that I want you
Oh how will I ever touch you like I long to
You just blow right through me

You stand in the shadows
The room, dark and narrow
I bloom down to the marrow
It's a beautiful storm
It comes with no warning

You bear the scars from someone heartless and selfish
Altered your mind 'til you can't see your way
And now you stay 'cause you feel worthless and foolish
Hey girl don't let him drive you insane

If you could see your glory
Embrace yourself and all of your beauty
If only you could see your glory
That inner grace, why can't you believe me

You got all of the strength and power
But your picture is not complete
If you can't live this life forever
Better look inside yourself and change your world

With burning hands he demands night and day
You sacrifice your passion under stress
Don't let those tears you cry be cried all in vain
Don't loose your soul through your selflessness

If you could see your glory
Accept yourself and all of your greatness
If only you could see your glory
Follow your dream on to a brighter day

You got all of the strength and power
But your picture is not complete
If you can't live this life forever
Better look inside yourself and change your world

Keeps you hanging on with empty words of love
He believes that it's enough
You know in your heart it's less than you deserve
But a change is gonna come

Change your world
Look inside yourself
You've got to change your world

Change your world
If you could see your glory
You can change, you can change your world

Change your world
Look inside yourself
You've got to change your world

Change your world
If you could see your glory
You can change, you can change your world

You got all of the strength and power
But your picture is not complete
If you can't live this life forever
Better look inside yourself and
Better look inside yourself and
Better look inside yourself and change your world

Sometimes I hold my breath for the longest time
Close my eyes and watch this free fall flight
Scared of coming down from these dizzy heights

I need a snapshot before the last light fades
'cause you're looking at me in that way again
Want to capture this in case this moment ends

Don't let the feeling go, now it's really here
'cause only heaven knows what's happening
I do believe we can make this world stand still
If we don't change a thing

Last night I had that same old dream again
Walking on a tightrope without a safety net
But I had my wings because you were there

Don't let the feeling go, now it's really here
'cause only heaven knows what's happening
I do believe we can make this world stand still
If we don't change a thing

Don't let the feeling go, now it's really here
'cause only heaven knows what's happening
I do believe we can make this world stand still
If we don't change a thing

We don't need to change a thing

Don't change a thing

Don't change a thing

And then we find we`ve lost all sense of soul
Are we past the point of no return

Behind that cloud you're hiding
There you stand but you're not there
Once again the words have left me
Second guessing, is it fair?

Tell me why should it be that
We can't say what we mean?

I saw the truth in your lies
I see a veil of disguise
Can't do this any longer

Must follow my star
And you need to find out who you are
See I understand, I know who I am

And I don't need it any more

And I've been lifted up
Cried a thousand tears of joy and fear

Getting ready to go to work

Knew what I wanted but it's hard to find
All the time holding out for a love that I deserve

The moment you came into my life

In my heart I can feel it
In my mind I can see it
I just have to believe it
What do I have,
If I don't have you?

Oh I really can't believe,
How much my life has changed
When I look into your eyes
All my fears are swept away
Now I wake up every morning
And see a brand new day
Through the struggle I'll survive

I've been down and I've been lonely
Every day another story
About what a heart is going through

When I think it's all behind me
History knows just where to find me
But when the clouds come into view

I know wherever the road goes
I will always find my way
I know wherever the road goes
Every heart will have its day

Heaven knows just where I'm going
I face it all not even knowing
What future lies ahead

But they will put your faith in something
You don't care how hard you're running
If you're never running scared

'cause I know wherever the road goes
I will always find my way
I know wherever the road goes
Every heart will have its day

Wherever it takes me
Is where I wanna be
Wherever it takes me
I'm gonna keep my spirit free

I'll keep my spirit free

'cause I know wherever the road goes
I will always find my way
'cause I know wherever the road goes
Every heart will have its day

'cause I've been down and I've been lonely

But I know, Yes I know
I'll find my way
I'll find my way
Every heart will have its day
And I'll find my way
Find my way....

Don't know where the road may take me
Every day another story
I will find my way

Heather Small,"Well, well, well
It seems like it was only yesterday
When my mama told me, don't fall in love with the first girl that comes your way
She was pretty and nice, but I took her advice and passed her by
Years have passed and it don't look like love's gonna give me a second try

Boy, the look on your face tells me you understand
Could it be your love life, like mine, needs a helping hand?

Yeah, you need love like I do, don't you?
I can tell by the way you look when I'm looking at you

I know it ain't fit and proper for a girl to talk this way
But I can't cope with this loneliness, not one more doggone day
Every day has been an uphill climb to keeping my hopes afloat
Judging by your silence, boy, you must be in the same boat

Come on, tell me, girl, does it ever happen to you?
I'm gonna tell you something and, believe me, it ain't no joke

Woke up with a shorter reach

Walking through a concussion
And the dosage that's left of you
Throw away it's a toss up
Dropped outta the contest to throw up

Heard you dropped my name 
Heard you dropped it all the time

Time 
Time 
Time

You smile goes around your head
Like you can see from behind
You're always hanging one step behind
It's numbing the things you don't say
Throw away it's a toss up
Dropped outta the contest to throw up

Heard you dropped my name
Heard you drop them all the time
Your smile goes around your head 
So you don't have to move to show off your good side

That wasn't so hard to swallow
Went down easy as a capsule
Went down easy as a candle
As soon as you got a new angle

This town just gets smaller
And all my friends have new names
Like Tylenol
Demerol
Anacin

Something to lose

You're always looking down from a picture frame
It's sickening how we just get in eachother's way

Well, I can't be shocked like I was before
So don't throw your rocks at my window no more

Heatmiser,"What a monster this kissing disease
Did the paramedic bring you back?
Or was he dropping you off for the night
In broad daylight?

I can't stand up in here
I hit my head on your trap door
Can't come down to see you
Because I'm not that kind of girl

Why should I listen?
You already kissed him
And already replaced him
The telephone is my enemy now

I'm giving in if I make a call
How could I lose to a weaker hand
Lie down lie down it's bigger than I can stand
Up in here

I hit my head on your trap door
Can't come down to see you 
Because I'm not that kind of girl
Why should I listen?

You already kissed him

And think you can put it back

Heatmiser,"Kept my coat on
While you put your empty arms around me
Kept my shirt on
And wrestled my memory down
When I put my arm around you
I had to hold my mand in place
I didn't move to keep you from feeling chased

dropping off
You smile easy
What was I supposed to say?
Hits the ground
And it dies easy
Why did I decide to stay?

looks like I should forget you now
Underneath the covers I'm not naked
Maybe you were never next to me
Does all recorded history start tomorrow morning?
Did you forget or were your kisses my final warning?

a spent bullet brought me down
Add me to the list you stopped with blanks
Or how about a rundown of the top 100
Where do I rank
Did I even make the list
Or did I make a big mistake?

dropping off
You smile easy
What was I supposed to say

Always trying to get me alone
An easy way to lose it all
Always there when all else fails
Over by the west side rails

I only really needed alcohol
Something that'd treat me okay
And wouldn't say the things you'd say

Someone's gonna get to you
And fuck up everything you do

He's so unhappy inside
He's serious with everyone
And he thinks he'll win you with his angry kiss
Acting like he has no needs
Wanting you to watch him bleed

Made for each other bet you pay me any mind
Just goes to show my continual decline
They say that I'll recover my love of her once in a while
But I don't know
I don't think so

There's something that I'll tell you now
Now that no one else is around
The sort of lesson that I learned from you
Not quite the way you planned
But I know you'll understand

Someone takes a photograph
A picture while their sweetheart laughs
A perfect moment in a flash of light
Counting back from three till one
That's exactly what you've done

To all these decisions lying in my mind

Taking my time to work the problem out
Yet trying to convince her that there is no need for doubt

And remember when we first met we were only friends

But just in case things don't settle well with her
I'll say that I'm sorry and keep hoping for the best

Heaven,"You think that I don't feel love,
What I feel for you is real love.
In other's eyes I see reflected a hurt, scorned, rejected.
Love Child, never meant to be,
Love Child, born  in poverty,
Love Child, never meant to be, 
Love Child, take a look at me.
 
I started my life in an old, cold, rundown tenement slum.
My father left, he never even married Mom.
I shared the guilt my mama knew,
So afraid that others knew I had no name.
 
This love we're contemplating, is worth the pain of waiting.
We'll only end up hating the child we may be creating.
Love Child, never meant to be,
Love Child, by society,
Love Child, never meant to be, 
Love Child, diff'rent from the rest.
Hold on, Whoa.
 
I started school in a worn, torn, dress that somebody threw out.
I knew the way it was to always live in doubt, 
To be without the simple things,
So afraid my friends could see the guilt in me.
Don't think I don't need you,
Don't think I don't want to please you.
No child of mine'll be bearing the name of shame I've been wearin'.
 
Love Child, never quite as good,
(I'll always love you.)
Love Child, misunderstood.
(I'll always love you.)

We will read temptation and you sin

Last week, I could do all of those things
But now, I am just the man who sings

I've searched around for years and years
I've drank in bars; destroyed careers
Sold on a need to be famous

I've seen the good in men survive
Only to fail when I arrive
Convincing them I am blameless

I was the man with future sight
I would change fortunes overnight
Knowing for me it was painless

One day in April, 10:15
Awakened screaming by a dream
Something that touched me was burning

A diamond pin fell from my eye
Then something strange began to cry
""Your will can stop this world turning""

Since then I've fought more than I should
Against the will that I withstood
Hoping I could be its master

But now the dream is all I see
There is no hope of breaking free

It was an endless afternoon
It seemed that we were so immune

Here in Action Town""

Over any part
Of Action Town""

Can't work, I am tired all the time
Can't eat, since my appetite has gone
Can't think, when it started to go wrong
Can't move, I've no energy at all
Can't see, any end to this in sight
Last week, I could do all of those things
But now, I am just the man who sings
I've searched around for years and years
I've drank in bars, destroyed careers
Sold on a need to be famous
I've seen the good in men survive
Only to fail when I arrive
Convincing them I am blameless
I was the man with future sight
I would change fortunes overnight
Knowing for me it was painless

One day in April 10.15
Awakened screaming by a dream
Something that touched me was burning
A diamond pin fell from my eye
Then something strange began to cry
""your will can stop this world turning""
Since then I've fought more than I should
Against the will that I withstood
Hoping I could be its master
But now the dream is all I see
There is no hope of breaking free
One song away from disaster

Can't sleep, trying hard to find a rhyme
Can't work, I am tired all the time

This train of thought runs through my mind

I like it best when the choice is mine
I want to be free to speak my mind
And if I cry I want no-one to be there (be there)
Free to do what I want to do
And you should share this freedom too
If I lie it must be for a reason

We've come a long way now
There's still a way to go
And still we're moving onwards
For all that you might think we are innocent
Innocent people
We are free

I'm working hard
I'm looking for the week-end
Oh! my good god
How the work is hard
And when it's down to getting home
We don't know what to do - do you
I hurry home
All the people seem to hurry
Don't push me on
I think for myself
We move as one
We like to keep it all together

I take it all
No problem at all
I'm a page in the book
Oooh take a look
I'm a part of the whole
All my body and soul

I want you to know I've cried me a river
Why can't this taker change into a giver
Why can't I work it out
I want to be free

Free in what I'm choosin'
Free with no excuses
Free to see the people
And to move ooo! ooo! ooo!

Free to choose my lover
Free to choose my brother
Free to need another
And I do - I need you

I'm having a ball
I'm part of the wall
No-one sees me at all
I'm asking for one dance
I know that there won't be a second chance
There's no return
I'm ready to burn
I think I'll never learn
I'm looking for direction
What I need from you is real protection
I've done my best
I've failed the test
I don't care about the rest
Won't someone set me free

Free in what I'm choosin'
Free with no excuses
Free to see the people
And to move! ooo! ooo! ooo!
Free to choose my lover
Free to choose my brother
Free to need another
And I do - I need you

Heaven 17,"The tenth of may
It seems so far away
When you and I were strangers moving close together

Sometimes it seems
It's almost like a dream
Driving across the country and the road is endless

If I were you
Don't wait until tomorrow
I'd lead and wouldn't follow

Walk away - today
If I were you - please listen
Walk away - I'd say
If I were you 'go away'

The first of June
The summer came too soon
But from the day we met I knew you'd never go away

Sometimes I feel
The passion's not so real

Finding it strange to be together, not alone

If I were you
I'd smile and close the door
I'd never ask for more
Walk away - don't stay
If I were you - believe me
Walk away - I'd say
If I were you 'go away'

Fourth of July
With an independent sigh
I think the time's arrived to take what's going to happen

Wise men may say
It's easier to stay
But if you are there I'm only wasting time


If I were you
I know I'd want to hurt me
It wouldn't disconcert me
Walk away - I'd pray
If I were you - I'd leave me

Walk away - today

If I were you - please listen
Walk away - don't stay
If I were you - believe me
Walk away - I'd pray
If I were you - I'd leave me

Hold me

Don't run for home

I followed you I tracked you down
And now it's time to go underground
I've never been alone with you
So hold my hand and lead me through
If you say I'll make room for you
If you do exactly what I tell you to
The saddest face the perfect thing
It's time to face what's happening

Now that you're here
There's nothing to fear
Just look at me
Look at me

There's something I cannot resist
Let me tell you what it is
It's when you walk away from me
I promise not to set you free
Don't try to run I'm everywhere
If you escape then I'll be there

I know a place where we can talk
I'll walk with you, don't hide away
And leave me here alone
Not here alone

Alone with you
I think you always knew

Until I die I'm taking action
There must be more that we can do
Where am I just when I need you

There's none of us that really want to leave
From the frozen north to the sun soaked south

Till there's no-one left to talk to

I'd run to everyone that called
Since you appeared it's been a lot of fun
Between you and me, between the truth and a lie

You have a husband and I have a wife
And when you ask me why with your kissing eyes
How could we be so wrong, oh my oh my oh my
You'll always be there the same as any other

You like a sister and me like a brother
Like all the times I used to dream

Smile at me
Let me know that you're near me

I can see that you're near me
It's the only sound on the city street
If I sing you my song will you move your feet

I'm broken down and in a mess
Your love is all that I confess

Now I know that you're near me

I don't mean to shock, I don't mean to scare

But the world won't change and I don't care

I used to dream
One day somebody near me
I can't believe you're making me

There's a strange new rhythm in my life
It burns like the sun and cuts like a knife

Another version can be seen
She is black, he is white
They love each other but they also fight
Back from work, she's not home
Another evening angry, all alone
She arrives and he departs
Misunderstandings, then the breakdown starts

[Chorus:]

There's not much that you can do
Choose either one of them it could be you
The first time could be the only time
The odds against you and your hopes decline
Do it right, do it wrong
Console yourself that either won't last long

Make contact or remain in separate worlds

Heaven 17,"I was thirty-seven
You were seventeen
You were half my age
The youth I'd never seen
Unlikely people meeting in a dream
Heaven only knows the way it should have been 

Here today my tomorrow
Where you lead I will follow
All that kissing
No passion missing
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye 

Dinner parties followed
And all my age implies
My friends began to talk
I began to realise
If half the things they say
Are quarter true of me
Then how can I eclipse the youth
You gave to set me free 

There was something in your smile
That was hard to reconcile
The time had come to testify to reason
Though years will not erase
Remembrance of those days
At least there's no submission to hearts treason 

Here today my tomorrow
No more shame only sorrow
All that kissing
There's something missing
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye 

Now there's nothing left to cry for
And there's nowhere left to go
Just another hopeless fight
But how were we to know
The strong are sometimes wrong
But the weak are never free
The choice we made we can't evade
Don't try to follow me

No more pain only sorrow

Heaven 17,"We're going to stop this world from turning
We build it up, you knock it down
If you go high then we'll go higher
Beyond the sky without a sound all around

We've won, we've lost, we've counted up the cost
And we've evened out the scores we are contenders

I'm telling you so pay attention
These words of truth come from above
In God we trust and he has told me
I need you now and I'm talking love

We want a piece of what you're selling
Put up your hands and face the wall
How much it costs there is no telling
How much it costs to walk so small, and we're so tall

In truth we dare, we people just don't care
We've got you running scared we are contenders
You're black, or white, Arab, Christian, Israelite
We are hiding in plain sight we are contenders

Don't bother asking for a favor
I always get all that I want
Though some are foolish we are braver
Than those who do not have a bomb

Forget the turning of the seasons
Let's escalate and never stop
And yes we've talked but for no reason
Let's start again right from the top, countdown

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

Got the world on a string but it ain't got that swing
You speed it up we slow it down
A frontier wilder than the West ever was
No sheriff round this outlaw town

So Superman if you're listening
Help us out you're on the team
For truth and justice, the American way
The fight for right's not what it seems with laser beams

With gun and sword there is no reward
But we're fighting on we are contenders
We've won, we've lost and we've counted up the cost
And we've evened out the scores we are contenders

You're Black, or White, Arab, Christian, Israelite
We are hiding in plain sight we are contenders
No virgin birth is going to claim the earth
We know what you're worth we are contenders

How it started in such a strange way
It ended in a strange way too
And this is why I am singing this song for you

It's a foolish thing to do
Such a foolish thing to do
Give your heart to someone new
It's a foolish thing to do

We've all made the same mistakes
One foolish glance one smile we made
A hundred thousand feel this way
While other people are just waiting for the day

It's a foolish thing to do

Go when you want it
When you need it
Don't just believe it
For the first an last time
Stop !
You'd better look around
One day you'll walk into the room
Your eyes will meet
You'll fall in love too soon
The next time you might hesitate
The chance is all those rooms have eyes
So don't forget

It's a foolish thing to do
Such a such a foolish thing to do
To go and give your heart and soul to someone new

Brothers and sisters in arms
This is the reckoning
Now only hatred fills our hearts
Raising the colours of freedom

In ruthless fights, I saw my best friends die
Now buried far away, so far away from home,
Lionhearted soldiers, no one shall forget their names
Understanding what the world still had to learn

No mercy to the villains,
Defending the republic infected by a fascist pestilence
This righteous fight reveals your shame,
Delivered to oblivion, those who fought a horrid beast

Homecoming held no glory and silence covers ours tombs,
Scorned and despised, left and denied, but still do I defy,
I still resist and fight your apathy,
And still I fight",53 Nations

In the smoke and the heat we're gasping
For a breath of some fresh air in this town

So save for me, the pleasantries
How pathetic this must sound
To patiently still be craving
A taste of the good life in this town

In the smoke and the heat we're gasping

Of one day finally getting out

Sharpening knives ",Watching You
Heavens to Betsy,"I don't know how to be good to you
You're too close and you know it too
Nobody has a good enough excuse
I'm just fucked up and so are you

I love you so much you could hurt me
So I do it first so you won't see me
Laugh it off and I don't feel it
Hard as rocks and nails underneath
Hardly anyone is sincere

All I know is anger that is real
I barely know how true goodness feels
I don't even know how to feel
I know I built walls all around
I'm begging you to knock them down
But yours are just as big and mean as mine
Tight defenses and we draw the line

If you want to go, just go 
I'll watch you walk away
I don't care if you go
I'll watch you walk away
I'll die if you go
I'll watch you walk away

Stop everything
Stop all these fucked up games
Promise me we'll be good to each other
Promise me, I need it signed, sealed, delivered

Stop everything
Or my heart will break
My pride isn't worth it
Help me this is hurting
If you want to go just go
I'll watch you walk away

Super girl
She isn't real
I can't fly all alone
I can't even get off the ground
I don't know what else to say
I don't want to push you away
I need your help today
I can't get off the ground today",Complicated
Heavens to Betsy,"if i show you that i'm alive 
if i show you i've got feelings inside
if i show you that i'm not perfect 
then will you know that you can hurt me


but if you think
that i'm not strong 
you best watch out
nothing can stop me


i read your words and cry 
you betray my trust a million times
you poison my life with lies
you victimize, victimize, victimize you victimize


but if you think
that i'm not strong 
you best watch out
nothing can stop me


i got a heart that's true 
i got somethings i must do
i know that everything's fucked up
but i ain't ever gonna shut up

Heavens to Betsy,"I've seen the way you looked at the sky
You looked right up at it with unclouded eyes
That ain't the way I see anything
I don't know if I can stand another day of rain
You left the nest so long ago
You walked right out one day
It was easy for you
Ruffle your feathers
Everything you have in my face
Well, I had to leave my wings at home today

cause I've seen you in the sky
How did you get so high?
I don't know how to fly
Cause you leave me paralyzed
I wonder why only some of us get to touch the sky

you were born with blue, baby boy blue in your eyes
You were born to touch the sky, the sky
My sky, my sky

cause I've seen you in the sky
How did you get so high?
Cause I don't know how to fly
And you leave me paralyzed
I know why only some of us get to touch the sky

I know what privilege is
I know what mine is, and why
But if I could, I'd steal yours
And I would fly so fucking high

cause I've seen you in the sky
How did you get so high?
Cause I don't know how to fly
And you leave me paralyzed
I wonder why only some of us get to touch the sky

all that I can do is watch you fly
All that I can do is watch you fly
All that I can do is say goodbye",Paralyzed
Heavens to Betsy,"you follow me on the fucking street

Heavy D,"This one definitely goes out on a censorship tip
So everybody sit back, relax and have a champagne sip
We gonna teach these people out there who are
Against saying what we want to say the right way
ya know what I'm saying, so what we're gonna do
Is kick back, swing a little funky beat by my man
DJ Pete Rock, producer extraordinaire, yo Pete Rock
Make it clear

I can flex, bend, lend a pen to a friend
Keep a party pimping from now to then
I don't have to swear, curse or juggle
Lyrics in the verse to make a party bubble
So mister Censorship, tell me, what's your problem
There's girlies on the corner, and phifey can't solve 'em
How did she say it, I'm curious G
Does she say honey love me, or baby baby, funny
Anyway, we say what we want to say
Play how we want to play, feels good that way
So G Rap, huh, it's time to kick a verse
Do your man a favor and don't curse

You're telling me don't curse on a verse, they did it worse
First I put a curse on every verse
I kind of got outrageous
Check it, even made a record on how I'm doing on the be	-I-T-see-he's
Drop some verses for the bust
Every word that you heard is cause I didn't give a f-, aw shucks
Hey yo, I almost forgot
The curse is a plot but it's getting kinda hot
So I'm a let profanity retire, hey
But if worse comes to worse, I'll cut you out like Richard Pryor
So Grand Puba, kick a verse
But do your man a favor and don't curse

Don't curse bust it
I won't curse, I'll take a famous curse word and just say kcuf
Kcuf flipped around the other way means ha
Boy when I do, I see, I can't get stuck
Jump on the mic then I earn a quick buck
Buck meaning loot, then I grab some boots
And set wit my troops
For those who can't follow and got stuck
Kcuf flipped the other way means ahem, hem hem
It's just a curse, I freaked a nurse in a hearse
But I made sure I had my hat first
CL Smooth, it's time to kick a verse
God cypher the rhyme, you can't curse

Go ahead ask me, when I kick a curse in a verse, I say nope
Grab you by your hand, wash you're mouth out wit soap
Thinking to be the last one wit the bad lingo
Scooping on the skins in the church from your bingo
Sounds of the Mecca, dark fresh from the tailor
Because they made a movie when he cuss like a sailor
Better yet, dialect dirty like a subway
Freaking for your loot, here to make it go the other way
In a vocabulary scrimage
But cursing in my village ain't good for my image
So Big Daddy, you know it's time to kick a verse
But do your man a favor, don't curse

Uh, the smooth rap inventor that enter
Parental discretion's not advised so there's no need to censor
Kiss on, peep it, but you want to beep it, what
I feel like slapping a sticker on ya (chill chill, see) but
Too magical rhymes are too tragical
For any source to stop Kane from getting capital
If I thought sticking me was dissing me
Man, don't you know that this would be worse than Stephen King's Misery
So clean all profanity, stealing all the man to be
Rocking any microphone you're handing me
So Heavy D, I'm about to disperse
So kick another verse and don't forget not to curse

God Bless but I can't mess around wit the curses
So I'm a kick verses or a verse
Soul brother number one here to kick facts
Smoke the microphone and produce crazy tracks
Your my bad bro, let's start the flow
I'm a kick rhymes till it's time for me to go
I can't curse cause Heavy D said so
Now I'm a get back to the subject
Get wreck, if you think I'm bluffing, just check
Wit the crew, Pete Rock and CL Smooth very down to earth
And we didn't have to curse

Yea, yea the Abstract poet Q-tip of a Tribe Called Quest
Here to wreck, ya know what I'm sayin'
Got my man Pete Rock and my man Heavy D in the house
And we're definitely chilling on the lifted tip
So bust the spit out, aha

Flim flam flim, lick my big black stuff
Plus I kick a curse to be rough enough
You can put the sticker where the sun don't shine
So back off and let me get mine
Visions in my head when it's dealing wit hits
If I had 4 girls then I lick 8 its
Wait, don't want to hear no drama
Cause the bum didaly Heav is a fav of my mama's
So i blew out get mad lifted
Don't have to say up the show that I'm gifted
God bless me 'cause I reach my 21st
Heavy D, don't drop a curse

Peace, peace, peace to the preacher
I'm talking about a verse without a curse that's how I reach ya
I can rock a party without a swear or a harsh verb
Backwards, no curse words, Heavy D prefers
So swing, swing to the Soul bequiem rhythm
Before I say goodbye, let me tell ya how I hit 'em
CL, Pete Rock, G Rap, Maxwell
Big Daddy, Q-Tip and ah me as well
Time to say peace, thank Pete for the beats
This funky beat was made for the street
Notice how clean that we kept every verse
But if worst came to worst (We all say a curse)

Make ya smile from a simple kiss

Check it, roll over my lover, the sun is beaming
The hot water's runnin' and the bathroom's steaming
Champagne bottle in the corner half done
Room's still bright from the morning sun

Yeah, we're snuggled up now it's time to buckle up
So call me later, cutie and I'll pick you up

Forgot I was big stuff, rough tough, and all that stuff, huh?
You jabber jaw junkie, rap tour flunkie
Quick at the lip, but when you see me you flip like a monkey
It always amazes me, how some brother's faces be
Smilin' but behind your back they talk like an enemy
But I got a sharper blade, from here I see better days
Sittin' on my porch countin' loot drinkin' lemonade
Swingin' with the shy type, girl who's the fly type
The non gettin high type, that's how you know she's my type
Tick tock tick, things are getting thick

""Here comes the Heavster, and I know it makes you sick""",Here Comes the Heavster
Heavy D,"Oh yes this is special
This is direct from what we call The Funk House
This is a total dope phat one, knowhatI'msayin?
And this is how it's done, Uh!

I did good in my hood as a youngster
The Heavster was never a punkster, no sir
No ma'am, hot damn, me and Michael Jackson jammed
I dug Soul Train, not American Bandstand
The bigger nigga is back and I'm on the right track
As a matter of fact, I'm all that
So ring around the Rosie, oopsy-daisy
Topsy turvy, you never heard of me you don't deserve me
Fly like Kinievel, drive like a BMW
You never knew I could bring trouble to
a cordless you can't afford this don't get aboard this flavor
Unless you got the fever flavor for a Pringle
Come be a single, let me see you mingle jingle dangle
Sammy Davis Jr. was Mr. Bojangles
(Here is something you can't understand)
Tell me y'all, who's the man?

Who's the man? (The Heavster)
(""Time keeps on slipping"")

Yes, too many brothers be fakin' moves, or frontin' grooves
Peace to all the brothers on the block, drinkin' and passin' brew
Money tried to flip but he got flopped
Said it was his corner let him know his corner's on my block
I know your fantasy, don't Stay, I ain't Jodeci
When I used to juggle y'all was crumbs who didn't notice me
But now you see me in a magazine, on your TV screen
On the radio liver stereo lookin' clean
All of a sudden I'm attractive, I'm handsome, I'm gorgeous
But back in the day you used to say you can't afford this
I wreck shops and got props from New York to Cali
I'm Big Willie, you silly Sally from the valley
Ain't nuttin changed... wait a minute, I'm a liar
The crib is definitely doper and the girls a lot flyer
(Here is something you can't understand)
So tell me y'all, who's the man?

Who's the man?
Who's the man?
Who's the man?
Phenomenon one, phenomenon two
Who's the man?
Like I said, this here, is official

Back in the day I used to punch clocks now I'm drippin' props
And countin' loot, and shootin' hoops, and lookin' cute
in tailored suits, made for the Over-weight Lover
undercover, over cover
You know my MO I do damn well on the stage show
I'm gettin' paid by the pound and I got mad flow
Flip flop who's the bigger one, quick to figure one
two, three two one, ah!
Keep a pen and a pad on stash
I used to crab the last, now I flow for dough, and I rhyme for cash
I'm glad to say goodnight to Johnny Carson
And brother where you rub it 'fore you catch the Magic in your Johnson
Honeydips, money grips
I know the difference cause I learned tricks in the ghetto mix
(Here is something you can't understand)
So tell me y'all, who's the man?

Everything here, is phat, knowhatI'msayin?
Don't take it the wrong way, but I'm lettin' you know
For the last time, this here is official
This is fat",Who's the Man?
Heavy D,"[Chorus]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Do it like this though, do it like this though, do it like this though
Make it fat like

Aiyyo ruff ruff rugged rugged ruff ruff digga Dan
Who's that?  The man, I'ma slam it like Bam-Bam
The big man, the bigger plan, the nigga jams
Quick to figure and I pack Palladium stadium stands
Rugged raw, clear the floor
R&B hardcore plenty more. been on plenty tours
Been in plenty drawers, far from just okey-doke
Not into no hokey-poke, although I may drink a Coke
Hell no I won't smoke no coke
Steady steady but ready for pitty petty
Big and heavy, far from Chevy, so save your gas for Getti
Mic check it, microphone check it
Watch me wreck it; I'm never half steppin'

[Chorus]

Far from a chump, I'm a champ, I get amped
When I run through camps, gimme some plaques on the stamp, HEY
I need a girl who got plenty trunk, who knows I got ghetto funk
Not into blunts but I be on a stunt hunt
Got crazy drama, dramatics, big girls in Bahamas are addicts
So now they cling like static, dig it
I rolled up on some old wonderama type of drama
I'ma, comma, big belly punanny momma harmer
Bag a cute, so NIGHT troops, I'm all about
Two scoops, I cut loose, just me and a few troops
To handle static to me is automatic
I never panic or stall, I'm gigantic so yes, y'all

[Chorus]

Uhh, king of the big boys, bigger boys, don't even matter
Save all the chitter chatter, I make em split and scatter
I keep em goin for blocks, I never ran from cops
I roll with my flock, and get props from dreadlocks
I treat a mic like a bad habit, I grab it I gotta have it
A funky junkie flippin styles is automatic
I freak a beat like a prostitute, I'm always in hot pursuit
I'm tryin to get lots of loot, lots of boots
Do jungle rocks like a hustler moving crack
Like a muscl-er microphone damager handin ya rough like a wrang-ler
Sew up cities with girls of pretty, known for the nitty gritty
My flavor, is major, you're itty bitty

[Chorus]",Yes Y'All

If you want it you can have it
Baby come and get it
I'll be right here waiting for you
(Take your time, everything'll be fine)
If you need it you can get it
Anyway you want it
I'll be right here waiting for you

Uhh, straight off the top, I refuse to stop
Chicks cling when I do my thing I got it locked
Officially, I'm yo' big belly da-ddy
Technically, you don't need to be with nobody but me
Ha-va-na ci-gar, Ja-mai-can ni-gga
6 Benz, Cartier tint lens, what?
I dig yo' steez, knock knees, trunk full
Body all lumped up, lifestyle Trumped up
Platinum blonde, hazel eyes chinky
Diamond on the pinky, skin bronze, you with me?
She, good'n'plenty, Benz E-320
Me, I pull over, drop that red Range Rover
Shorty was milkshake thick, sportin' silk, mink and
She had it sewn, flowin' on her own
She's the type of girl to put her crew on the map
Anything you want, don't wet that, you can get that

[Chorus]

Now let me speak about this chick I call hotter than a flame
Seen her chattin' with this dame, I had to go and get her name
She with her friends, they at the bar gettin' they drinks on
Outfit's off the hook with ice gold links on
Way the skirt is fittin' black, who hittin' that
I'm kickin' game up in my head steadily sittin' back (I feel ya)
Now I'm think in the attempt to attack the
Shorty that I'm lookin' at that's lookin' at me
But soon enough I get my nerve up
{?} passes me a drink as Pretty Lou he sparks the herb up
I'm with my Uptown team, makin' noise
Heavy D, Soul IV Real and Lost Boyz
Now I feel it's time to go and get my try on
And take shorty home that I got my eye on
Anything that you want you can catch that
Like my man said, don't sweat that

[Chorus]

By the way mama
Last night the club was tight, shorty's dead right
But you stood out the most, so I had to play you close
Nuttin' less than, black essence, your presence real strong
Dudes all around you frontin' hard, gettin' they trick on
I ain't mad, I just watch you gas 'em up, then I watch you pass 'em up
Then I step up, now look, you shook
You stuck, what's yo' name, what's yo' digits, what'chu drinkin'
My treat and when they steppin' you get swept up off yo' feet
My mission, first position, backs I twist 'em listen
Ain't no-bo-dy, like Hea-vy
The all-star, dapper rapper
In conjunction with the funk that keep it blazin' out they trunks
What'chu want, sky's the limit, I live it, now is you wit it
Slow flow, Poconos style, I mean I'm chillin'
Top billin', anything you want, anything you need
Don't wet that boo, you can get that true

[Chorus]",You Can Get It
Heavy D,"I know it's hard to believe, when your eyes just can't see
So lean on Me, I have not disappeared and I can see you from here
Tears are blinding you from the truth
Oh, I'm right here in front of you

Won't you reach out and take my hand
Don't be afraid of love, don't be afraid of love
I'll know you'll find your strength again
Don't lose your faith, don't be afraid

There are questions on your face with no answers in place
So just believe for tomorrow will come and with it, the morning sun
Oh, I hop you will let me in
That's when the healing begins

There's a wall surrounding you
Love alone can make it through
You're caught up in the circle you drew
And when your world starts tumbling' there for you",Don't Be Afraid
Heavy D,"Baby, I've got many problems
But my momma won't help me solve them
So I come to you (you you)
But your ass don't wanna be bothered
So I come around don't wanna be bothered
So I come around trying to be down
But you're acting like a silly clown
Ask me for $50
Said to myself
Well I'll be damned
Why are you trying to give me such a very very hard time
When I spend the money on you
You can't get a little of the bump and grind
There must be another man (man), holding your hand (hand)
Please tell me
Baby, baby
I will

I'm trying to go on without you here in my life
I don't wanna accept the fact that your no longer mine
Just to know there's somebody else who's holding and kissing you
It makes a guy like me feel like I'm a fool

So girl, I'll do anything
Anything you want
My word is bond
Baby I was wrong
Please forgive me for what I've done
I'm sorry for all the things I did, I'm sorry, yes, I am
I'm sorry for all the things I did, I'm sorry, yes, I am

I'm trying to cope with these emotions everyday (day)
I realize it's too late now you're gone away
Is there something that I can do to reassure
That I won't hurt you like this anymore

So I'll do anything
Anything you want
My word is bond
Baby I was wrong
Please forgive me for what I've done (tell me one thing I have to do)

Heavy D,"I'd like to dedicate this song
To everyone who's cried before
Who's felt pain and suffering before
This just ain't about me
But most importantly I'd like to send this song out to my family
I love my family
'Specially my mother and my father
I wanna thank you for being so strong
God bless you, I love you

Sometimes I sit back, relax, sip on Cognac, reminscin'
on how it used to be, when we were kids
Laughin' at the things that we did (uh-huh)
Damn near broke but we knew how to live, peep the scene
Mom and dad, bustin they ass, fourteen years
In the night they would pass, each other
Tryin' to raise six of us one sister, four brothers
Two deceased, laid to rest
And I miss you cats, what I wouldn't give to bring you back
To fill the void that you left in my heart
Your last breath really tore me apart
And I'm sorry if I never said I loved you enough
I truly did

[Chorus]
Ask, heaven, heaven is there room for me?
Cause I believe, that's where you'll be
Waiting for me, at the end of a stairway to heaven

Aiyyo I swear to you, I'll put it on the bible, no lie
On the days you guys died, I seen daddy cried
I was shocked, y'all know how tough pop is (f'real)
But he really turned soft when life stopped his kids (damn)
Speakin' of kids? Yours - beautiful
Promisin', beautiful, I wish you could see 'em
So much of life, with a touch of yo' light
And I'm doin' my best, to make sure they alright
When I was young, some big kids stole my bike

Came home and told y'all and had it back that night
When I was older you started smokin' and you sold my bike
I remember cause I cried all night; I wasn't mad
I was sad cause the crack had control of your life
And you couldn't even put up a fight
You told me Dwight, I promise lil' brother, I'ma make it alright
You left home, and you died that night - damn I miss you

[Chorus]

Thanksgiving day, came home, surprised the family (surprise)
Walked inside the crib, the mood was wrong (damn)
I heard my moms in the background screamin' on the phone (dad what's goin on?)
I rushed to get closer like yo mom, what's wrong?
She said your brother's buggin' out, hurry up, take a look
I grabbed my brother Floyd and we started to book (run run)
It wouldn't take long, he lived right around the block
I tried to stay strong, but I was shakin' a lot (I'm scared)
Got there, ran up the stairs, he was stretched out in the lobby
A 7-year jail bid physique graced his body
I fell to my knees, like no Jerry please
I was frightened, he was fightin' to breathe
Mumblin' somethin' ""Heav' don't let 'em take me I ain't ready to leave""
I felt his clutch on the cuff of my sleeve, then it eased
He felt calm, as he died in my arms
OD's off of heron, and just like that, he was gone
Thanksgiving day will forever be hard
'Cause that's the day we gave my brother to God, ma you hear me?
Thanksgiving day will forever be hard
'Cause that's the day we gave my brother to God, I love you",Ask Heaven
Heavy D,"Do you ever feel like, gettin' high?
Do you ever feel like, leavin' this world?
Uhh do you ever feel like, you ball by yourself?
Do you ever feel unnecessary? Uh-huh

Don't call me crazy but sometimes I feel like gettin' up
and dancin' in the middle of the night
I need a way to release myself
from all the pain and the pressures in life (one time)
Considered drinkin', but then I started thinkin'
I'd probably drown away my life
Gotta do somethin', too many people frontin'
You see I need a way to get by

[Chorus x2]
That's why I get hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh
from dancin' in the middle of the night
Dancin' in the moonlight

Last night I'm cruisin' the Meadows, better known as the ghetto
Seen a shorty named Black
At thirteen he's deep in the drug scene
And there probably ain't no turnin' back
He said dat, momma was smokin', he tired of bein' broke and
poppa locked up and ain't comin' back
I almost cried when he looked in my eyes
and he said he didn't care if he died

[Chorus]

I've been dreamin' for years, cried a river of tears
I can't take it no more
I seen the bible dying
And I don't wanan cry no more (just ain't right)
Too many people pushin' too many people
Hate is just a sequel, cause still nobody's equal
And I find myself lying
'Cause I don't wanna cry no more

Something about you really turned me on and I can't figure you out
Cause everyday I'm thinking about diggin' you out, what's that about?
I got visions of turning you out

Flourish you with jew-ell rings real-ly
If you tell me that you do love me sincerely
Take the American express and go shopping
Put your coochie in Gucci cause we ball in the night
Call your girls tell them that your flowing with water
And it's sickening cause this tricking is really out of order

Consecutive hits
I break sun with Pun
Crew hall with Ball
Screw all of why'all
We the big shots
Heavy rotation
Every location
Smoke stogies with roadies on the corner in front of Bodega's
World famous
You gon' love us or hate us
You the type that'd scuff up my gators
Because of my papers
Been about my glitter
So you killin' my jaw
Damn can't a nigga live homeboy?

Days and days
Blazing green shades
Of sticky haze
Remember Eightball from doin' it the player way
Turn it up and we gon' rock it 'till the track stops
Make the club seem hotter than a crack spot
Players pushin' poetry like it's a kilo
Keep my jewelry froze
Like my name's Sub Zero
Pimp 'till I'm gone thug living ain't new to me
Love me a ghetto girl and everything she do to me
Presidential suites and Bezo's turn 'em out
Pass 'em through the clique until everybody burn 'em out
How you lovin' that icin' on the cake right
Miami girls hit that white and shake it all night
Slab riders, chrome twinkies
Smokin' sticky
Iced pinky
With some styles flipping with me
Memphis, let me break it down for you pal
Makin' easy money pimping hoes in style

[Chorus]x4

It's me, BP
From the middle of little Italy
With Eightball and Heavy
Diddly diddly diddly dee
Its no surprise
How we pulverize
All you smaller guys
Fronting that you live but we oversize
Holding knives to you neck
All my nines and my techs
Shine on but get strive for the best
Take time to perfect
Every rhyme that I kick
I should get a sign on my dick
""I don't got time for them chicks""
They be tryin' to resist
Every time I insist
They submit
Bitch don't be lying on my prick
I'm too quick for your lies and deception
Hold your eyes in my direction
If you strive for perfection
Just watch the pro
But its like a chore
You gotta cap and go
Feel the most
Catch me next time I gotta rock a show
Got's to go
I'll be back and some other fat chick
Peace to the Bronx, a mother in this rap shit

Word to mom she bananas, I swear I wanna slam her
Like Tito Santana, can't wait to wrestle her
Curious about the sex in her, Gabbana dress on her
Next to her, this cat champagne sippin', ice drippin'
Roleys on the cuff, but she winked at Big Stuff
""How you doin papa?"" I'm just chillin' mama
Loungin' - ""Smokin' on your Cubana?""
Si, the, first name Heavy
She started rubbin' on my big belly, stay put
I can see how you got these other dames shook
'Cause from the first look, a nigga like Water was hooked
She said the name was Carmelita, boricua, from Puerto Rica
Tu eres, mi amiga, senorita?
Me and you friends baby, me and you friends
""Si somos amigos""

Hu-huh, yo
You the flyest lady in the house ""true"" hear Heavy out
Wanna make you scream ""uh-huh"" wanna make you shout ""okay""

Week in Brazil, D keep it real ""mmm""
Sleep in the hills, native of the 'Ville
Native of Jamaica, steady makin paper ""aight""
See all the linens be crushed plus the gators
Smoke Cuban, gruff smoke Garcia Vegas and dutches
Did world tours, ten buses ""what""
Live life deluxest, some friends is hustlers
And them the type of cats that will spend ends to touch ya
See me I wanna love ya, just flow with Diggy
And I'm always thinkin' of ya, that's word to Biggie
Let's blow this joint and splurge the city, damn you pretty ""gracias""

Stayed beneath my feet before.

In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

People stop and stare
They don?t bother me,
For there?s no where else on earth
That I would rather be.

Let the time go by,

Can be here on the street where you live.

Ja han alistaa sua Woyzeck vaikka katsot hanta niin kuin tykki kohteeseen
Sulle ihminen on kuilu ja sua pyorryttaa kun katsot syvyyteen

Niinkuin verinen rauta
Ei kylma ruumis tunne kylmaa ollenkaan

Sun mika nyt on Woyzeck, oi Jumala

Mika sinun on, maailma

Piparkakkuhevosella 
Hullu lahjoo huoran lasta 
Aina jollain lahjuksella 
Hyva myydaan maailmasta

Aurinko laskee, kaupunki hehkuu, tuli taivaan lavistaa
Sinun aurinkosi laskee vaikka maa vain muuttaa siihen suhdettaan
Maailma sykkii, valtimo villi
Petos johtaa petokseen
Sinun harhasi on totta
Antaa menna, antaa menna, antaa menna uudelleen

Aurinko laskee
Maailma sykkii
Sinut hirteen tuomitaan
Nyt on edessasi kuilu

Había que llorarte para que me besaras
Y había que suplicarte para que me acariciaras

Aquí te traigo yo mi ritmo
Mueve las caderas y se desata un cataclismo
Bien pegadito, junto a juntito

Me va llevando poco a poco a la locura

Sóbate, mi amor, porque te quema que te quema
Te di mi trago y tu bebistes

Y los secretos de mi vida conocistes
Bese tu boca, mordí tus labios

Hector & Tito,"Uma tigresa de unhas negras e íris cor de mel
Uma mulher, uma beleza que me aconteceu
Esfregando a pele de ouro marrom do seu corpo contra o meu
Me falou que o mal é bom e o bem cruel

Enquanto os pelos dessa deusa tremem ao vento ateu
Ela me conta com certeza tudo o que viveu
Que gostava de política em mil novecentos e sessenta e seis
E hoje dança no frenetic Dancin' Days
Ela me conta que era atriz e trabalhou no Hair
Com alguns homens foi feliz, com outros foi mulher
Que tem muito ódio no coração, que tem dado muito amor
E espalhado muito prazer e muita dor

Mas ela ao mesmo tempo diz que tudo vai mudar
Porque ela vai ser o que quis inventando um lugar
Onde a gente e a natureza feliz
Vivam sempre em comunhão
E a tigresa possa mais do que o leão

As garras da felina me marcaram o coração
Mas as besteiras de menina que ela disse, não
E eu corri pro violão, num lamento, e a manhã nasceu azul
Como é bom poder tocar um instrumento",Tigresa

Una vez mas 
Para mi republica dominicana 
Puerto rico 

Se que estas nerviosa es tu primera vez 
Te tiembla todo el cuerpo 
Estas llena de ansiedad 
Fue mucho el esperar y hoy por amor 
Tu cuerpo esta sobre el mio 
Comenzare a besarte lentamente la piel 
Muy delicadamente mis labios bajaran 
Sentiras corrientes semejantes 
A las aguas de un rio 

Llegara un escalofrio 
Mas no sentiras molestia 
Todo sera una fiesta 
Mas abajo de tu ombligo 
Y en el puerto de tu cuerpo 
Mi barco anclara 
Oh oh 
Niña, ya niña no sera 
No no no 
Sueltate el pelo 
Que vamos pal cielo 
Voy a regalarte para ti 
Un mundo nuevo 
Sueltate el pelo 
Que vamos pal cielo 
Dejate llevar 
Por el vaiven de los cuerpos 
Sueltate el pelo 
Que vamos pal cielo 
Voy a regalarte para ti 
Un mundo nuevo 
Sueltate el pelo 
Que vamos pal cielo 
Dejate llevar 
Por el vaiven de los cuerpos 
Y no hagas caso a la gente que comente 
Que digan cosas malas 
No no no 
Lo nuestro es un acto responsablemente 
Para dos que se aman
Tris XD 

No creo que sea posible 
Ya no se ni yo lo que era imposible 
Quiero comerte 
Estas irresistible 
Que tiene miedo 
Solo estas exquisible 
Estamos juntos es algo perfecto 
Te beso toda y mi amor yo te inyecto 
Estas temblando eso lo siento 
Que nos amamos los besos yo los siento 

Llegara un escalofrio 
Mas no sentiras molestia 
Todo sera una fiesta 
Mas abajo de tu ombligo 
Y en el puerto de tu cuerpo

Oh oh

Como duele hoy
Hoy te extraño más que nunca y no estas aquí 
Lentamente hoy 
Me va causando tanto daño que no se vivir 

Y se me va la voz, si no tengo tus ojos 
Y no siento el calor, si esas noches no son mías 
Y no estoy junto a ti, la razón para vivir 
De rodillas, de rodillas junto a ti 

Y se me va la voz, pensando que te has ido mujer 
Y no siento el calor, el calor de lo prohibido 
Y entrégamelo todo, que todavía llevo dentro 
La razón de este recuerdo

Una brisa que libera refresca el corazón

Héctor Acosta,"Aprenderé, a no sufrir cuando un amigo te mencione
A soportar los latigazos de la noche
Cuando el deseo se me cumpla con tu nombre
Y te trate de llamar

Aprenderé,a convivir con los recuerdos sin que duelan
A convencerme d que no vale la pena
Amar a alguien con pasión q no te quiera
Y a pensarte sin llorar

A despertarme sin tus besos y
Aceptar que junto a mi ya no te tengo

Aprenderé a olvidarte, arrancarte de mi piel
Y el corazón
Aprenderé a negarme a mi mismo
Que te quiero como no he querido yo
Aprenderé, a sacar todo
Este amor de mis venas

Aprenderé,cuando te encuentre
A controlar mis emociones, a no escribirte
Ni dedicarte mas canciones a comportarme
Como si yo fuera el hombre
Al que no le duele ya

A despertarme sin tus besos y
Aceptar que junto a mi ya no te tengo

A despertarme sin tus besos y
Aceptar que junto a mi ya no te tengo

Héctor Acosta,"Me llamas
Para decirme que te marchas
Que ya no aguantas mas
Que ya estas harta de verme cada día
De compartir su cama
De domingos de fútbol metido en casa
Me dices que el amor
Igual que llega pasa
Y el tuyo se marcho
Por, la ventana
Y que encontró un lugar
En otra cama

Y te has pintado la sonrisa de carmín
Y te has colgado el bolso que te regalo
Y aquel vestido que nunca estrenaste
Lo estrenas hoy
Y sales a la calle buscando amor

Me llamas
Para decirme que te engaña
Que ya de nuestro amor
No, queda nada
Que se busco otro nido
Que abandono tu casa
Que te faltan caricias
Por las mañanas
Me dices que el amor
Igual que llega pasa
Y el tuyo se marcho

Ya me estoy cansando de la forma que me tratas, hoy yo me voy de aquí 
Maldigo el matrimonio por ti no creo en mujeres esto llego a su fin 
Estoy decepcionado cupido me ha fallado a mi vida llegas tu 
Una mujer celosa bochinchera mala esposa y puedo hasta seguir 

Me voy de la casa y vendo el anillo ya no te soporto punto y final 
Contigo la muerte es algo divino y se que al cielo tu no llegaras 
Tendré precaución libre de pecado porque en el infierno te puedo encontrar 
Eres una actriz que bien fue tu acto, ni en el primer año me hiciste feliz 
Que ingrata mujer hasta no ví mala suerte te deseo lo peor 

Yo daré consejos, no todo los hombres que casen viven mi ejemplo 
Ella no era así, y a través del tiempo las palabras se la lleva el viento 

Sentimiento negra

Sentimiento torito

El niño entenderá su madre fue muy mala, quizás me fuiste infiel
Hoy quiero el divorcio aceptes o no aceptes hoy yo me marchare 
Que cruel es tu castigo vivir junto contigo me sube la presión 
Pa´ ti soy un relajo mujer tan descarada fiera sin compasión 

Me voy de la casa y vendo el anillo ya no te soporto punto y final 
Contigo la muerte es algo divino y se que al cielo tu no llegaras

Tú fuiste una ingrata muy mala conmigo y mí despedida será tu castigo 
Y yo ya no estaré corazón, si el niño pregunta quien es el culpable

Y yo fui bueno contigo este es un infierno y por eso me despido 
Y tú ya no tendrás mi amor, amárrate escuchando esta canción",Me Voy (El Anillo)

Que el amor que yo te di no fue sincero
Después de que casi te entregué la vida
Tu me andas tratando cual si fuera un perro.

No comprendo la razón de tanto insulto
Ni el motivo que nos hace andar en guerra
Sera que en el fondo todavía me quieres
Y que donde el fuego ardió cenizas quedan.

No es culpa mía mi amor
Que yo haya sido el mejor
Sinceramente llegué y así mismito me voy.

Vamos a dejar las cosas claras
Y a dejarnos ya de discusiones
Porque si el amor es verdadero
No se sale de los corazones.

Héctor Acosta,"Para llegar a donde estoy
Anduve perdido, recorriendo los caminos
De ansiedad y de dolor
Seco de esperanza de caricias y confianza
Hasta que encontré tu amor.

Para llegar a donde estoy
Tuve que conocerte
Tuve el respaldo de la suerte
Tuve a mi dios siempre presente junto a mi
Para llegar adonde estoy.

Pase por noches que no se merece nadie
Sentí que todos me negaban hasta el aire
Para llegar a ti, para llegar a donde estoy
Llegue a pensar que el mundo me daba la espalda
Que cada puerta que tocaba se cerraba
Para llegar a ti para llegar a donde estoy
Y renacer contigo, y renacer contigo.

Se que fui culpable

Is everywhere in my mind

I remember your laugh, the sound of your voice
I'll never forget that, where ever I may end up at
The touch of your skin, where do I begin
I can't say enough, bout everything about you that I love
We talked forever about nothing at all

We had the best time, but you were the best part of all
I just missed you that's all, that's all it was
I just loved you that's all, that's all it was
I just wanted you bad, that's all it was

Well I just missed you so much
Well I just missed you so much, so much, so much
Well I just missed you so much

I got all your letters that you sent to me
I kept everyone that's all I got to hold on
Remember that time when you were so sad
I'd get you to smile it only took a short while
And then one day, you stopped callin' me

I never knew why, that still almost makes me want to cry
So never again, will I see you

Y se parece a Patty Manterola
Tiene un corte latino cintura pequeña y grande cola

Y esta noche va a pasarla sola
Bueno no tan sola
Que jodienda anda con Paola
De pensarlo me duelen las bola

Llegan a la disco y Paola en su viaje rola
Hizo la fila se quedo en la cola
Los gatos la miran ella entra pa' la disco sola

Y en su mente dice ahora es que es

Ya la vieron sola
Y se le pegan por su grande cola
Los buitres anda mirándola
Y busca Paola

Por que se dio cuenta que anda sola
Y es que Paola
Fue pa' Las Gladiolas a capiar rola
Con un rasca bola

Que Paola se encontró en la cola
Y la mangaron monta en un Corolla
Y la amiga sola
Loca por poder guayar la cola

Con un gato que esta velándola
Pero tiene jeva y que casualidad que es de Gladiola
Donde Paola fue a capear la rola
Y llego Paola

A la disco en su viaje rola
Y me vuelven a doler las bola
Y me caso nola
Música pa' que guayen la cola

Pero ella sigue bailando sola
Pero no tan sola
Que jodienda vuelve la Paola
Aunque no baila por que es cocola

Y su novio llama y no sabe que ella se fue sola
Y mucho menos que anda con Paola
Ella le pichea y quieren que le soben la popola
El gato que esta velándola

Y manda Paola
A que le diga al gato que anda sola
Y Paola va y le dice hola
El se descontrola

Agarra to deja la novia sola
Y en su mente dice ahora es que es",Ahora Es Que Es Paola

Por el fucking dinero
Bendice a los que se me viraron
Y hoy en día están sufriendo las consecuencias
Bendice a los que intentaron dañar mi nombre
Sin saber que están jugando con las habichuelas de mi familia
Bendice a mis hermanos del dolor
A mis guerreros, que dan la vida por mi y yo doy la vida por ellos
Bendice a los que le molesta verme caminando
Pues mi caminar los pisotea
Bendice a los colegas del género
Que la desesperación los lleva a atentar contra mi, pero siguen dando foul
Bendice a mis hermanos muertos, y a los vivos
Pues no saben quien va a ser el puerco que se les va a virar
Bendice a los que se comparan contigo
Y se olvidan de que Dios da y Dios quita
Bendice a todos los que escucharon mi disco
Y por ser tan envidiosos lo están criticando
Bendíceme a mí, Padre Celestial, que voy pa' la calle
Échame la bendición

O dime si has vuelto con el
Dime si has podido borrar
El dolor tatuado en tu piel
Dime cuanto vas a llorar
Cuanto mas sufrirás por el
Si el no te da amor
Porque aguantarlo mas
Si cada golpe que te da
La vida se te va

Una noche mas que duermo a solas
Otra noche que la paso hablando solo
Un dolor que me acompaña
Contando las horas
De la vida que se va
Como se me fue todo
Porque contigo se me fue la vida
Porque contigo se me fue el aliento
Porque demonios mi fe está perdida

Como le hago con este sentimiento

Dime si tu andas sola
O dime si has vuelto con el
Dime si has podido borrar

Quien no ha sufrido  
Y quien no ah llorado  
 
Nadie manda en mi corazón  
Cuando te enamoras,  
Pero como te duele  
Cuando te traicionan 

Nadie manda en mi corazón  
Cuando te enamoras,  
Pero como te duele  
Cuando te traicionan

Ella piensa que la aventura de entregarse  
Nunca esta demás un destino cruel  
Se prepara para darme un golpe fatal  
Un golpe fatal  
El le ha sido infiel  
El le ha sido infiel  
Probo de otra piel  
Probo de otra piel  
Sin pensar en las promesas  
Que le hacia aquella mujer  
 
Quien no ha sufrido  
Y quien no ha llorado  
Y quien en la vida  
Cuando uno se entrega  
Si lo han traicionado  
Quien no ha sufrido  
Y quien no ha llorado  
 
Nadie manda en mi corazón  
Cuando te enamoras,  
Pero como te duele  
Cuando te traicionan 

Nadie manda en mi corazón  
Cuando te enamoras,  
Pero como te duele  
Cuando te traicionan
 
Hoy dios te dice  
Ponle como un sello hacia tu corazón  
Como una marca a tu brazo  
Por que fuerte es como la muerte el amor",La Boda
Hector el Father,"Señor, hoy me humillado ante ti
A pedirte por todos mis hermanos
En la calle en especial por Coscú
Señor dale un encuentro contigo
Como lo hiciste conmigo que ellos
Entiendan que tu eres la verdad y la vida
Señor dale entendimiento
Cuídalo de las maquinaciones del diablo
Señor ten misericordia
Envía un bollado de ángeles que lo protejan
En el nombre del padre del hijo
Y del espíritu santo
Amen

Yo respiro el aire que la vida me da y no por el que me quita
La R-15 grita y vas a donde nadie te visita
Mera Father yo estoy harto de escuchar la misma lata
Fulanos quieren meterte, estoy de frente y nunca tratan
Mera hermano yo quiero estar tranquilo cocodrilo
Pero si hablan de matarme en ese flow yo no vacilo
Le doy medio kilo pa' que salga, que los busque
Y te aseguran nunca verte y que de tí ni me preocupe

La vida es una Coscú yo ya tuve fama y fortuna
Y e visto mil sicarios desde que estaba en la cuna
He visto lobos ladrar como dueños de la luna
Pero cae la noche y la muerte nos vacuna
Esto es sencillo cualquiera se presta pa' jalar gatillo
Y la historia termina como la de Alex Trujillo
Que Dios le hablo y le dijo, hijo de la calle corre
O termina muerto como coco el de torre
Coscú abre los ojos que Dios te esta ablando
Tu no te imaginas de lo que te esta librando
Yo siento que el diablo pa ti algo esta tramando
No es lo mismo Coscú que tu tires que te estén tirando

Yo se que tengo la doña también tengo el nene
Pero estos enemigos, unos que van otros que vienen
A mi no me conviene estar así pero al que se revela
Me meten a mi y Héctor quien me va a pagar la escuela?
El nene Coscúlluela yo se que estoy bregando mal
Pero cambiar a estas alturas por tu forma de pensar?
Es como yo dejarlo todo por buscar del nazareno
Sabiendo que después en la calle me va a tirar veneno

La calle te quita la calle na de a devuelto
Tutoño y Sam eran hermanos y están muertos
Coscú la calle te jala Coscú la calle te añoña
Mata al pana tuyo y se te queda con la doña
Abre los ojos que estas ciego Wason despierta cano
Pierdes tus hijos tu familia y al final to eso es en vano
Si no me crees Coscú dale un call al Shako
Pa que te diga que se siente si te matan a un hermano
De sangre y el sufrimiento viene al rato
Y los panas tuyos se te visten de Pilatos
Chico Coscú siéntate que quiero contarte
Que anoche me llamo pito el de juanamaco
Y me dijo brother mio papi esto es infernal
Tengo mil panas y ninguno me han venido a visitar
Que si combo que si chavos, que si guagua con los clavos
Que si uno tiene par de pesos y te sirven 20 rabos
Que si matan que si roncan si te tocan los acabo
Que to quieren se los jefes nadie quiere ser esclavo
Chico Coscú, papi no te envuelvas con la movie
Que la fe de cuando cae justo lloran los mas bravos

En cada pueblo hay un barrio y en cada barrio hay un punto
Y en cada punto se mata y es que de eso se trata papa
Recuerda father que tu te puedes mover
Pero esta calle a ti te hizo y esa si te vio crecer
Hay conciencia me siento a escribir un tema de violencia
Me siento abochorno porque se que si es mala influencia
Te lo juro brother que yo no se no que escribir
Siempre me piden los mismo de matar o de morir
Que si las akas, los kioskos que si se vende y no se fía
Y antes que no era famoso nadie me quería
Nadie me llamaba es mas yo era feo
Ahora es diferente Coscúlluela el del vaqueo
El de las gatas las flacas El de los peines pa' las akas
Yo ya llegue hasta aquí te juro que nadie me saca
Yo estoy bien mi hermano y se le agradece la intención
Y espero que al igual que yo mantengas oración

(Héctor)
(Chico Coscú abre los ojos no entiendes
Que es Dios el que te esta ablando?)

De que te vale tus flacas de que te vale tus akas
De que vale tu punto si tu hueles a difunto
Si cuando mas te ranquean te visitan los del DEA
Cuando te toca la fea de ti se olvida to el mundo
Chico Coscú, no te envuelvas todavía estas a tiempo
Que tu quieres que te maten o te paso como a tempo?
Que inocente lo enceraron y no cometió la falta
Que tenia 100 amigos y que solo 2 le mandan cartas
Mera Coscú yo creía que la calle yo la amaba
Y la vida poco a poco lentamente me quitaba
Hoy estas pegao y mañana to se acaba
Y en la noche yo sentía como el diablo me jalaba
Y me dice ponte los collares y ve donde tu luz
Mata dos gallinas y te saco el retolu
Mera Coscú yo te quiero y te hablo right trae
Esos son demonios que se visten como ángel de luz
Abre los ojos, lee Biblia que eso lo dice Pablo
Coscú estamos con Dios o estamos con el diablo?
Y aunque me digan loco mi camino es eterno
El tuyo se ve lindo pero es el del infierno",Entre el Bien y el Mal
Hector el Father,"Hay yo siento que Dios nos
Toca la puerta
Hoy hay gente que esta vida y que el amor
Entro a esta
Puerta hoy oigo una voz del cielo que me dice todo alerta
Y me dice hijo mio dile a
Mi pueblo despierta despierta

Hoy e visto como se acaba el petroleo
Hoy e visto como un hombre con
Otro hombre tienen matrimonio
Hoy e visto como un padre mata a su hijo
Hoy e visto como lo que la
Palabra Jesucristo dijo
Hoy e visto que la prensa la verdad omite
Y no dicen que en el polo norte todo se
Derrite hoy e visto como la iglesia se
Consume y se enfría y a lo malo le dicen bueno se
Cumple la postacia

Hoy he visto que países se
Matan a sangre fría
Hoy e visto como un hombre
Se hace llamar Jesús el mesías
Hombre mata esposas es el plato
Del día reina la maldad y el AMOR se enfría

Ay, yo quiero decirte el tiempo
Se esta acabando y q ya el amor no existe no existe
Ay, no puedo mentirte el tiempo
Se esta acabando no te rindas y resiste resiste

Hoy e visto que se acerca el sonar de la trompeta
Hoy e visto levantarse a falsos
Profetas predicando un evangelio solo financiero
Jehová es tu pastor y te puede dar dinero
Y te dicen hijo diezma tranquilo
Y con calma con palabras bagan que no hieran tu alma
Hoy e visto como se aumenta la ciencia
Hoy e visto como cae la máxima potencia
Hoy e visto como el hambre al mundo descontrola
Como sube el euro y como baja el dolar
Hoy e visto que mi barrio se consume en plomo
Hoy e visto como se desase la capa de ozono

Hector el Father,"Mi vida fue, una caja de pandora
Tenia pal de pana, pero ninguno de Cora
Ninguno me llamado, para ver si yo sigo bien
Solo estaban detrás de los billetes de 100
Hipócritas tenían mi careta, no eran mis hermanos
Querían las pesetas si les estaba bien si no era un maseta
Quieto tiburón que ya te vi la aleta

Consejos de mi madre no cogí porque era un terco
Gente que ayudó, comenta que yo soy un puerco
Mil beses le dí y una vos que le párese
Me di fama estaban por los pan y por los peses
Ahora se escampan por que escucharon rayos y los truenos
Eran solo víboras llenas de veneno
Yo voy pa' lante por que dios en un culto me dijo
Te quito amigo malos y te pongo amigos buenos

(hay gente que andan contigo y haciendo muerte)
(hay gente que andan contigo y están haciendo trampa se acabo)
(yo ciento aquí la gloria de Dios)
(pero se van a quedar con las ganas)
(por que ellos caminan solos y dios camino contigo)

Héctor se convirtió pa' mí que esta asustado
O lo están buscando o es que esta en barrado
Dios me hablo al oído y dijo me tienen cansado
Hijo anda conmigo ante que mal acompañado
Quizás escuche esto usted se asombre
Pero de cierto Dios no contendrá pa siempre con el hombre

Así que júzgueme y digan que soy un cobarde
Dios dijo que despierte que se me esta haciendo tarde
Que se esta haciendo tarde que no jugara al listo
Que cogiera mi cruz y que siguiera a Jesucristo
Ahora no van a ver lo que mis ojos están viendo
Pero mi gente crean desierto los entiendo
Pues yo queriendo como un siego me encontraba andando
Pero por dentro la casa se me estaba derrumbando

Mi cara reía, mi corazón llorando
Tu me comprende porque a si te encuentras caminando
Mi pastor me dijo que esto se esta acabando
Que ya no hay uno ya son 4 bandos
Madres están llorando niños con pistolas están andando
Y padre que a sus hijas están violando

La gente esta vacía con depresión se siguen suicidando
Vienen tiempo de hambres como esta pasando
La gente le palabra la siguen ignorando
Mi gente abran los ojos el diablo lo esta jalando

Hoy lo digo todo como Cristo en la palabra dijo
Que primero Dios antes que mis padres y mi hijos
Gracias Jehová por pasar de mi esta copa
Por mas que tu tengas con el vacío te topas
Yo como un payaso con mi frente en alto
Y la vida me ganaba asalto por asalto

Muchos que decían yo quiero ser como Héctor
Y yo muriéndome vacío y llorando en mi cuarto
Y clamando y diciendo señor te necesito
Refúgiame o la vida me la quito
Y venia una vos del cielo que decía

Héctor el dinero solo compra momentos bonitos
Yo soy la vida eterna el camino y el sendero
Recapacita que vivimos en tiempo potreros
Imagínate que esta noche yo busca mi iglesia
Tu salvación no la podrás comprar con dinero

Héctor a ti quien diría que la vida te a dado tanto
Antes eras el malo y ahora quieres ser un santo
Diga lo que quieras yo no vengo agradar al hombre
Yo agrado a cristo que con su mano me seco mi llanto

Sigue a cristo a cristo que me hablo y me dijo
Héctor doy promesas de que sanare a tu hijo
Sanare tu hijo pues yo soy verdadero
Sanare a tu hijo lo que no hizo el dinero
Señor porque a mi que siempre te di la espalda
Que preferí la fama el dinero y la falda
Que cuando me moría q a mi me respondiste
Que señor llegaste hasta tiempo tu nunca te tardas
A mi que te falle y me aparte como un canalla

Hijo levántate tranquilo y tu boca calla
Que de los vivos te escogí para avergonzar al hombre
Y serás mi guerrero para la ultima batalla
Pues heme aquí señor te extiendo mi mano
Porque se que la batalla que tendré no será en vano
Aunque me tienten y quieran que yo cambie tu mensaje
A lo bueno diré bueno y a lo malo diré malo

Héctor estas fanático que desenfoque yo voy
Pa' la iglesia cuando Dios me toque
Y aunque estoy vasillo yo lo cojo con calma",Mi Testimonio
Hector el Father,"El de la torta, te acuerdas?, el del combito
El que te decía vente mata a ese puerquito
Saca la 40, vuélvete loquito
Pero como sufrí cuando me mataron a Vito

Vamo' a matano de decía, yo tu no me quito
Saca la 40, vuélvete loquito
Pero en las noches
A mi Cristo le pedía
Señor por favor, cuida a mi hermanito

Eres el artista del momento eres la moda todos quieren dar tus pasos
Pero te sientes solo
Eres un payaso

Detrás de una chica, de un bm, de una casa esconde tu fracaso
Y sigues vació
Eres un payaso

Te crees el terror, controlando todo con balazo
Pero ten cuidado que los amigos están escasos
Te dicen que te aman y te dan un abraso
Y cuando das la espalda te llenan de plomazo

Y tus hijos se quedan solo y no le hacen ni caso
Tu esposa a tu pana, se le entrega en los brazos
Y a tus hijos el nuevo papi los llena´e cantasos
Y a ti ya te enterraron, fuiste un payaso

Eres el artista del momento eres la moda todos quieren dar tus pasos
Pero te sientes solo
Eres un payaso

Detrás de una chica, de un bm, de una casa esconde tu fracaso
Y sigues vacío
Eres un payaso

Yo era el payaso que decía que la vida era una cura
Que cogieras las chamacas y que le hicieras travesuras
Pero en las noches le pedía al Dios de la altura
Señor cuida a mi hija, que se mantenga pura

Y te decía dale pa' lo oscuro pa' que la calientes
Dale calor, pa' que veas como se siente
Pero en las noches, a mi cristo le pedía
Señor cuida a mi hija, que no manifieste

Eres el artista del momento eres la moda todos quieren dar tus pasos
Pero te sientes solo
Eres un payaso

Detrás de una chica, de un BM, de una casa esconde tu fracaso
Y sigues vacío
Eres un payaso

Son 15 años en esto, tu crees que yo bromeo
O que es una emoción, o que esto es un tripeo
Yo tengo mil historias, que puedo contarte
Como la de Berto el de Garateo
Que pa' los 90 tenia un combo de 70
Tenia 40 pana, y una fama violenta
Ni el combo ni el dinero, el dolor evita
Hoy esta preso y nadie lo visita

Primos que se matan, como Benji y Lelo
Hermanos de crianza, como Black y Raelo
Tu no eres intocable, hoy puedes ser tú
Me acuerdo de mi hermano, Tito Bolondru
La calle te da alas, tu te crees que vuelas
El diablo y la muerte, dándote gabela
Tu das la vida y todo por la calle
Y terminas muerto como Israel 'e Manuela

Que nunca te cojan eso eso es un mito
El diablo te usa, para hacer el delito
Después que te matan nadie te recuerda
Todavía lloro a mi hermano Vito
Como Pichile, Juan de dio, Goldo Pitel y Aleta
La calle te vence, papi aquí no hay metas
No es pa' meterte miedo, es pa' que abras los ojos
Y sepa que en la vida, la muerte no respeta",Payaso
Hector el Father,"Yo que para ti fui hecho
Y tú hecha para mi también
Perdóname
Por buscar tu olor en otra piel
Y porque lo nuestro nunca toco el fracaso

Aún yo siéndote infiel
Perdóname
Por el dolor se que te falle
Y por no estar ahí para secar tu llanto
Que yo mismo provoque

Perdona anda perdóname
Por las veces que sola te deje
Y yo por ahí aferrándome a otros brazos
Perdóname perdóname
Si la vida me permite
Estaré contigo hasta la vejez

Perdóname perdóname
Porque fingí que te olvide
Y me sentí como todo un payaso
Muriendo sin querer
Perdóname

Gracias por que
Aunque me fui tu me esperaste
Gracias por que
Te quedaste en el mismo lugar donde te deje
Gracias por que
Yo jugando a ser un hombre feliz
Y tu en casa velando por mi hijo

Gracias por que
Viviendo en ti y yo no estando ahí
Perdóname
Por dejar que sea franco mi corazón
Pero moría por volver de nuevo a casa

Vez que Dios es fiel
Te prometió traerme de nuevo a casa
Ves que Dios es fiel

Perdóname
Porque lo que Dios unió jamas el hombre podrá separarlo",Perdoname

Hector el Father,"Se cuanto lloras
Se que tu corazón
No siente una razón para vivir y lloras
Cada noche pidiendo Dios mio perdón

Y lloras sin fe
A solas y se
Que cuentas muy poco conmigo
Yo renuevo tu ser

Si haz de mirarme
Al verte solo en el camino
No vivas sin mi,no sufras sin mi
Escucha hijo mio

Si me tocaras
Si tan solo el borde de mi manto
Tocaras
Te sanaría del dolor y del quebranto

Hijo no sabes cuanto
Deseo que vuelvas
No camines sin poner tu mirada en mi
Ya no camines mas sin mi

Oh no
Hoy siento que las oras
Se me hacen segundos
Siento que me muero y que se acaba el mundo

Es cierto que e logrado
Un éxito rotundo
Pero por dentro siento que soy un
Vagabundo

Lo he tenido todo
Riquezas y placeres
Buscando ser feliz
He herido a mil mujeres

He tenido todo
Lo que un joven quiere
Pero mi corazón lentamente se muere
Y me pregunto?

De que vale el dinero
Si no puedo comprar un amigo sincero
Si no puedo encontrar
A alguien que me diga
Héctor cuenta conmigo con o sin dinero
Mi mente dice no
Con ella batallo
Quiero servirte pero
Por mi orgullo callo

Camino sin norte
Casi me desmayo
Y me levanto doy tres pasos
Y de nuevo fallo

Levántame no veo la salida
Con mis fuerzas no puedo
Aquí sigue la herida
Muchos que me saltan
Y me llenan el ego

Pero quiero palabras que me llene mi vida
De que valen los lujos?
De que vale la fama
Si cuando cae la noche
Me arrodillo en la cama

Y te clamo y te digo
Señor te necesito
Regresa a mi
O la vida me la quito

Si me tocaras
Si tan solo el borde de mi manto
Tocaras
Te sanaría del dolor y del quebranto

Deseo que vuelvas

No camines sin poner tu mirada en mi
Ya no camines mas sin mi
Ya no
Ya no camines mas sin mi

Hoy Dios te dice
Vuelve a mi

En el pico tando ronda tenia un par de banchu 
Un par de onda y el que fantasmeaba lo metía 
Pa' la fonda, le decían el Bin Laden
 
Y andaba con un par de loco, sacaba la pory 
Y le bajaba el moco, mezclaba el perico con el choco
El no era un chipichapi, papi de to' el carce 
El era el coco, su socio Belto andaba con la pali 
Bien envuelto por el ronel, pero tenia el deo suelto, 
Ya estaba cansao de trabajar por poca plata,
 potro con los balchu y con los carros 
Y con las gatas, Belto bien pelao aborreció 
Y en las latas siempre amaneciendo 
Sendecando la picata, empezó en su tienda 
Belto monto un kiosco de cinguillo con las cizañas 
Se para el turillo le gustaba la chaucha pero mas 
Le gustaba el gatillo y andaba con un par de loquillo 

La diferencia llevaron a los brothers a matarse, 
Belto quería con los de potro quedarse hubo 
Par de nebula hasta amenazarse, quedo que se cogieran 
Tenían que matarse, la mata se puso mala, 
Belto se creía el mas que jala 
Y la noche se vistió de gala, se puso careta Belto 
Se metió hasta la sala y le dio diez impactos de bala

No dejes morir, mi hija, mi esposa, no me dejes morir señor,

Aceptaban to' los lalgo, Belto con la gata se dedicó 
A hacer el palgo, potro aborreció estaba loco por cazarlo, 
Decidio el decato, potro se gancho un 44 lo pillo y

Ustedes se preguntaran donde esta potro, 
Potro esta en el corazón de cada uno de nosotros 
Que no hemos sido dignos, de darle las gracias a Dios, 
Después que Dios no ha librado tantas veces de la muerte, 
Pero escrito en la palabra esta, que Dios no va a contender
Para siempre con el hombre, porque de cierto el hombre es carne 
Y Dios es espíritu, ten cuidao que pa' la próxima no te abran la puerta",Tocaste La Puerta
