T.I.,"Rich by popular demand
The wait is over homie
Yes it is
A town connect
Know the city gon' feel this
Damn right
Say Toob I know you see me
Say Chris
What up boy
I know both our pops
Lookin' at us

I used to dream (I used to dream) oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I see (now I see) oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world)
And now I see (hey) see (hey) see (hey) see
Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I see (hey) see (hey) see (hey) see
Sitting on top of the world

Man I remember before I say that wait let me issue this statement
No way should reflection be mistaking for glorification
Now I remember so vivid me and my niggas was living
Sub-standard condition still handling business
Still laughing and tripping still having the bitches
I'm rapping now reminiscing and goddamn it we made it
From trapping standing and pitching with rich we stand in the kitchen
Splitting it eight ways flip it in eight days
Thought that while in a room it was just the way to behave
Kept the weight and the yey for most the paper we made in all dimes
I ain't lying the pleasure was all mine
Have big work to move but we served the small time
I always out shined the niggas with small minds
Who would of thought we would be arguably the greatest of all time
'Round here we developed such a sound down here
But duplicate it off the steel it can only be found here
Only listen to gs that other shit I don't hear
Shit they so far in the rear how would I even care
I'm too busy being a player staring at niggas careers
Been talk about it for years and now we finally here

I used to dream (I used to dream) oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I see (now I see) oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world)
And now I see (hey) see (hey) see (hey) see
Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I see (hey) see (hey) see (hey) see
Sitting on top of the world

They say what goes up must come down
But I ain't reached my cruisee altitude
Take a look at what I did but can you imagine what I'm about to do
The places I'm bout to go and the money I'm bout to see
Gave Bill Gates some binoculars and said look out for me
And see these expectations even at def jam
Cause I married the streets and Atlanta has been my best man
My momma quit her job and now she works with six figures
Cause I'm a self-made nappy-headed rich nigga
Private planes help me travel in peace
To four cities in one day and four countries in one week
Cause I work for myself and no one else cause I'm too smart too
Put one of my partners right through culinary art school
Now he my personal chef so that bread he get it
Put them all in houses cleaned up all of my friends credit
And now they witness all the glitz and the glamor
Catch us eating at straits Atlanta with women with table manners
Order in seeapore and lobster
Celebrating coming from nothing to winning Grammy's and rappers winning Oscars
And they say rappers shouldn't act nah suckers
We see Samuel Jackson like whats up motherfucker!

I used to dream (I used to dream) oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I see (now I see) oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world)
And now I see (hey) see (hey) see (hey) see
Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I see (hey) see (hey) see (hey) see
Sitting on top of the world

I know them haters don't stop plotting and wish you would fall
Cause I'm standing on top looking down at it all
I see you down there to y'all this ain't like I got it all
Homie I ain't get enough I'm still trying to triple up
So all we got is street cred and a cool building up
Say I'm doing too much shit I say I ain't did enough
Remember saying damn if I could just get to a million plus
And now I'm like shit what the fuck is a million bucks
Triple that on my bun thanks to bigs and run
But never mind what I've been through just look at what I become
All the shit I've avoided what I done for my sons
And daughters and momma just call her
I sold dope and dropped out of school seems its all they can see
They don't notice none of my family did that since me
I broke that cycle now my family live a life of
Mandatory minimals but not when the judge sentence them
Cousins in college where you think they get tuition from (answer that)
Jeffrey standing around wishing huh
And while you standing around looking dumb
I make it happen taking action over time goddamn good at it

I used to dream (I used to dream) oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I see (now I see) oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world)
And now I see (hey) see (hey) see (hey) see
Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I see (hey) see (hey) see (hey) see
Sitting on top of the world",On Top of the World
T.I.,"Hey, hey, hey, hey
Damn shorty
Look at you
I'm saying man
Is it just me or you got too much ass in them jeans
Come here

Hey,
I been watching you a while now
And I just wanna find a way to make you smile now
Why you blushing, forget about them other guys now
I know you ain't trying to tell me that you shy now
I realize that you're beauty could intimidate
Them suckers you ain't got no business for them anyway
With such a, pretty face big booty, little waistline,
I wanna grind from behind to the bass line.
Have a great time, pull yourself a shot girl
Chase it with the lime, now you feeling like a hot girl
I know you're probably used to deal with them wannabe's
But honestly I gotta say, I'm who they wanna be.
I promise all I wanna see is you up under me
Now we can disappear whenever, when you wanna leave?
I could guarantee the ride of your life
Any fantasies on your mind, we can try them tonight

[Chorus]
Oh yeah sitting here (I'm looking at you like that)
We sipping on patron, somethings on my mind (you wanna leave with me tonight)
It's been killing me all night long, and I wonder
(Misses shorty let me tell you what I'm thinking 'bout)
Oh girl I wonder (for real shorty let me tell you what I'm thinking bout)
It's the end of the night, and I'm thinking you might
Wanna leave the bar, park the car, turn into porn stars

Yes, I'd love to hear about your interests
I gotta say, your intellect got me impressed
See you're panties through your dress like a silhouette(look at that)
Patron got me thinking sex, did you feeling that
All due respect though, a simple yes no
Hey let yourself let go, shorty let's go (let's go)
Pull you to the crib, get you to the threshold
Kiss you from your pretty lips till you red toes
Time ticking it's the end of the night
Hey you could leave with your friend if you like
But I'm saying no (I'm saying no)
Hey we could ride out
Back to my house
I wanna see you satisfied inside out
Once I'm in you ain't goin' want me to slide out
You tell your girlfriends they goin' wanna try it out
A lil' more let's loosen you up
What we can't do in the club we can do in the truck (lets go)

[Chorus]

Hey would you, stay
Could you, play with it, with your tongue just a, little
You such a sexy individual physical and mental
And if it's sentimental shouldn't rules bend a little
Hey let me start at the top stop in the middle use a Popsicle
Make you shiver giggle when it tickle
I could talk to you dirty if you'd like that (bad girl)
I finish once, hit a blunt, start right back
I know you told me you a good girl
But shorty you's grown woman not a little girl
You could blame it on the patron or the champagne
But sometimes being bad could be a good thing

[Chorus]

Oh yeah sitting here
We sipping on patron, somethings on my mind
It's been killing me all night long, and I wonder
Oh girl I wonder
It's the end of the night, and I'm thinking you might

T.I.,"Hey, the price of fame cost to much (yeah boy)
Like these niggas talk to much (yeah)
I'm ready for whatever somebody better tell them (yeah boy)
Said I'm ready for whatever
Hey, hey, hey,

Even tho my head in the clouds I'm planted on the pavement
How I walk around people starring in amazement
I play a lot of game a well-being I ain't playing wit
They so judgmental man but they don't understand
If ya life was in jeopardy everyday is you telling me
You wouldn't need weaponry just because of ya felony's
Consider this at least I got everybody sweating me
On the streets there's people who wont rest unless I rest in peace
Killed my folk a year ago still in my sleep they threatening me
Paranoid you stressing me ain't nobody protecting me
I'm dealing wit the pressure from my partner dieing next to me
Niggas know I was arrested they coming for me eventually
This was all the things that I was going through mentally
This could be the reason I ignore the penitentiary
Not mentioning New Orleans niggas coming in the city
Killing all summer long ain't nobody pay attention

Now is it that hard to understand if you listen
Either die or go to jail that's a hell of decision
But I'm wrong and I know it my excuses unimportant
I'm just trying to let you know that I ain't think I had a choice, for real

[Chorus]
I had straps in my ride gotta go to prison
You waiting on me to die you gone be waiting for a minute
Boy i'm ready for whatever somebody better tell them
I'll be here when the smoke clear and everything settle (for real)
Cant afford the price of fame cause it cost too much
Man these sucker niggas lame and they talk to much
That's why I'm ready for whatever somebody tell them
I'll be here when the smoke clear and everything settle
For real, for real, hey for real, I said when everything settle
For real, hey for real, hey for real, hey for real I said when everything settle for real

I'm a man I ain't perfect I admit it I'm guilty
But understand feel me I was riding filthy
Cause niggas out there plotting to rob me and kill me
five hundred thousand every year spent on security
My future was bright but now its getting blurry
Cause niggas in a hurry to find me and bury me
But surely God'll deliver me up out it
I'm a fighter till the heart I'll forever be about it
I'm a father to my sons as it to my community
Look all that I done my good out weigh the negativity
Hey mentally I was focused on that letting history repeat itself
That's why heat was kept in a vicinity
Yes officially I broke the law but not maliciously
Through all the publicity was anyone considerin'
My position and the logic hidden my decision
But they caught me with them now I'm off to prison, period

But is it that hard to understand if you listen
Either die or go to jail that's a hell of decision
But I'm wrong and I know it my excuses unimportant
I'm just trying to let you know that I ain't think I had a choice, for real

[Chorus]

Hey I said listen homeboy
You can talk all you want man you know what I'm saying
Everybody talking to the king you know what I'm saying
They like Escalades everybody got one
But the fact of the matter remain
If you ain't walk a mile in my shoes and you ain't live a day in my life
You ain't survive the shit I done survived
You ain't had to deal wit the shit I had to deal wit homeboy
You cant motherfucking judge me partner
I mean look at folk like Sean Taylor
You know what they said, they said had he had a strap
He'd f lived today
You know what I'm saying
Now true enough I did wrong I broke the law
I deserve to be punished I understand that alright cool
But listen man I gotta house full of kids
A mama and an old lady whose life is my
Responsibility you dig that?
Now for all of y'all who think I was just riding around on some dumb shit
You know I'm smarter than you man
You know I'm smarter than you dog
Hey if you think I was just being stupid
Shorty I got some motherfucking ocean front property in Idaho for sale homie
If you believe that I gotta bridge in Brooklyn I wanna sell you partner
Hey man real talk in order to understand my train of thoughts
You'll have to put yo self in my position
You cant expect me to think like you cause my life ain't like yours
You know what I'm saying? If you don't understand that you don't
Understand english I'm done talking!",Ready for Whatever
T.I.,"Oh, oh, oh, oh

Hey , when I think about all my time and all my struggle
Through all my grinding and all my troubles
Man I came out from nothing , all I had was a hustle
With a blindfold trying to find pieces to the puzzle, no muzzle
I tell it like it is, that's that, right or wrong, I'm a call it how I see it
Don't forget that impossible is nothing, you're environment is irrelevant
Just don't let your emotions over power your intelligent
Refuse to give up, your mistakes will define you
Down dictate where you heading, then remind you
That time keeps ticking, let your mind keep clicking
Never stop thinking, be aware of your decision
Be aware of the collisions
And the potholes hidin' in the road that you travel on your lifelong mission
Just listen everyday like a snap shot is taken, 
If you live you could learn to just be patient

[Chorus]
Cause life is like a slide show
And all the places I go
And all the things that I know
Through all the highs and lows 
Cause life is like a slide show
And all the things that I've seen
And all the things that I've dreamed
You cant take away from me
Cause life is like a slide show

As I look back at a fly young cat
Who could rap with a dream, look where I took that
Beginnin' on Bankhead, then I spread out
Vision in my head, all I had to do is to get it out
When I walked out of my house, and look at my street
All I see is the opportunity that lead me to truancy
I ain't really have a roll model to influence me
Uncle Joink, said next year it's just gonna be you in it
As a juvenile caught cases so fluently 
Look at my life and learn from it, don't do it
If I only knew back then what I know now, 
How much better life it would have been if I slowed down
Maybe I have been Kanye, instead of seeing gun play
But god got a plan, I'll understand one day,
But one day of life like a snap shot is taken,
If you live you could learn to just be patient

[Chorus]

Looking back on my life time
See the slides go by
Time to wonder why
Looking back on where I've been
I remember when
You remember 

[Chorus]

Cause life is like a slide show 
Cause life is like a slide show 
Have seen, have dreamed, oh life is like a slide show",Slide Show

This to everybody stretched out behind the wall,
Countin' days on their calendar,
Flippin' pages, month to month

Treat you man
I just wanna let you know pimp,
You ain't missin' nothin' homeboy
Real Talk

I know the times seem long,
Just try and keep strong
Put on your headphones and rewind this song
Remember you ain't missin' nothin' holmes,
I promise you ain't missin' nothin' holmes

Hey, just now the club on hold and the broads on pause
You get home, it's gonna be waitin' on y'all
So dog, just know, for real
You ain't missing nothing holmes
I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes
On everything

My uncle did a decade,
Came home, hit the ground runnin' gettin' paid like he
Never did a day
Hit the streets, nigga still in the same place they were
Before we went in the chain gang,
And doin' the same thing
Cause the game go on, you only did two days in the joint
The day you get locked up and the day you go home
I know it feels like the world passin' you by,
Like shit happenin' everyday out there that you don't know 'bout
Every time you call home your baby momma show out,
And your partners don't even send you flicks from when
They go out
But don't worry 'bout it or stress it, cause shawty know what?
The time'll do itself, all you gotta do is show up
Keep layin' down wakin' up,
And thankin' the Lord
And 'fore you know it they gonna open the doors
True story, just prepare yourself for it,
If you ain't got a plan what you need was a second chance,
Shit, you gonna blow it!
Learn and visualize what you try to do,
And do the time homeboy, don't let the time do you
They say the time just flew on the street,
Hard to believe from me never but you'll see soon as you
On the streets

You ain't missin nothin homes
I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes

Probably thinkin' it's easy for me to say from here in the booth,
But they showed ya, they'd put me in there with you
Right now, locked down in the state of the fed, lay in the bed
Playin' it's over and over as you say in your head
Yeah, next time I'm a be straight
Just count down to my release date, peace of cake
My nigga Kap right now, servin' a life sentence for a murder he committed,
In self defense and in such good spirits, shorty ain't even tripping
And I could be right in there with him, no bull shittin'
He on his ninth year now, just waitin' to get out
Got me thinkin' my shit ain't even worth complainin' about
Cause it could still be worse for sho'
So you waitin' on me to lose hope, you got to kill me first
I talked to my nigga Big Meedge, had to tell him the
Streets miss him just as much as he miss the streets
Had to let him know whenever he released,
We hittin' the club like O three, this time it's on me
Yeah we laugh, reminisce for a minute and then I tell
Him just nobody ever did it as big
It'll never be the same in this city again, closest
You'll get is me and Jeezy and them
So dog, if it seems like you left behind, ten steps
Behind, just know it only gets better with time

[Chorus]

Hey, just now the club on hold and the broads on pause
You get home, it's gonna be waitin' on y'all

Her body's so tight up under that light,
I see her so clearly now, she's right there before my eyes

[Chorus: Akon]
Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer)
She got me wander'n now
Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer)
She got me day dreamin'
(Left and right, watch her going up and down, all night)
Yes I'm day dreamin'
(Left and right, watch her going up and down, all night)
She got me day dreamin'
(Left and right, watch her going up and down, all night)
Yes I'm day dreamin'

[Snoop Dogg]
5 foot 8 on the late what a date, she fell for the hook and the bait,
I took her to the yacht, the shrimp and steak
Then I took her to the gym so she could get in shape
No more drama, just late night thrills
Nigga in the hood with the gangsta grillz
Fillin out stacks of bills, jaguar like Jacksonville,
Bringing these hoes like Jacks and Jill

[Chorus]

[Akon]
I'm looking at the most beautiful thing in the world (world, world, world)
Her body's so perfect and spinning like a cinnamon swirl (swirl, swirl, swirl)
She looks like a fairy tale, but yet feels so natural (natural, natural, natural)
This one's a beast, but way to wonderful to be compared to an animal
She's like what I'm sipping on Shirley temple on ice,
She makes it just right,
That extra grenadine got me feelin' so nice
Her bodies so tight up under that light,
I see her so clearly now, she's right there before my eyes

[T.I.]
Hey I sit and gaze hazy eyed as I day dream
Her n her girls on the stage doing they thing
Double D's full of silicon and saline
She thirty but look only a day over 18
Her booty big enough to swallow up a g-string
Hey going put that ass on me like a bee sting
Hey let the King on, beat it like a tambourine
And peel ya out ya jeans and eat it like a tangerine
I see her face down, ass high
Make everybody throw that cash high,
Back in the club already
She stuck in my head since last night,
That's right, girl you got my dreams so,
Sexy when I sleep,
No more fantasies I want the real thing.

Ooh, I've been travelin' on this road to long
Just trying to find, my way back home
The old me, is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ooh, I've been travelin' on this road to long
Just trying to find, my way back home
The old me, is dead and gone, dead and gone

Ever had one of dem days, you wish woulda' stayed home
Run into a group of niggas, getting they hate on
You walk by, they get wrong you reply
Then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one then rush 'em
Figure you'll get jumped
That next, they don't wanna stop
There now they bussin', now you gushin', ambulance
Rushin' you to the hospital, with a bad concussion
Plus ya hit four times, plus it hit ya
Spine paralyzed waist down, now ya wheel chair bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive,
Just think it all started you, fussin' with three guys
Now ya pride in the way, but ya pride is the way you
Could fuck around, get shot die any day
Niggas die, every day all over
Bull shit dope money dice, game ordinary hood shit
Could this be, 'cause of hip hop music
Or did the ones, with the good sense
Not use it, usually niggas
Don't know what to do, when their back against the wall
So they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blo' I guess,
From Bankhead or from your projects
No more stress, now I'm straight,
Now I get it now I take time to think,
Before I make mistakes, just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday, the heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say, the old me dead and gone away.

I ain't never been scared, I live through tragedy
Situation coulda been dead, lookin' back at it
Most of that shit, didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it, when you out there trappin'
In apartments hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit didn't, next thing ya know we cappin'
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about damn, what a life I had
Most of that shit, look back just laugh
Some shit, still look back just sad
Maybe my homeboy, till be around
Had I not, hit the nigga
In the mouth that time, I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga, walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see, Philant no more
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his job, cost me more
Ida took that ass-whoopin', now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripe
A nigga put his hands on me alright
Otherwise stand there, talk shit all night
Cause I hit you, you sue me,
I shoot you, get locked up, who me?
No more stress, now I'm straight,
Now I get it now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes
Just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away.

I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west

A more divine southern rapper
Wit a swag like mine
Facin? all kind of time
But smile like I'm fine
Brag with such passion
And shine without trying

Believe me, pain's a small thing to a giant
I was born without a dime
Out tha gutta I climbed
Spoke my mind
And didn't stutter one time
Ali say even the greatest
Gotta suffer some time

So I huff and puff rhymes
Lyrics so sick wit it
Set the standard in Atlanta
How to get get get it
So you up and coming rappers
Wanna dis just kill it
I'm officially the realest
Point blank period

Whether I still live in the hood or juss visit
Whateva you can do in the hood I done did it
That's why the dope boys and the misfits feel it
This still his city as long as Tip living nigga

I'm sure to be in jail till 2027
Rather see me in a cell
Instead of this new McLaren
God'll take you through hell just to get you to heaven

So even though it?s heavy, the load I will carry
Grin and still bear it
Win and still share it
Apologies to the fans, I hope you can understand it
Life can change ya directions
Even when you ain't planned it

All you can do is handle it
The worst thing you could do is panic
Use it to your advantage
Avoid insanity, manage to conquer
Every obstacle, make impossible possible
Even when winning's illogical
Losing's still far from optional

Yeah they wanna see you shot up in the hospital
But when life throw punches, block ya counter like a boxer do
Been locked inside mi casa too long
I did a song to make it known that the king lives on, pimpin?

You ain't got a clue
All you do is follow dudes
Sound like a lot of dudes
I weather whateva storm
Make it out without a bruise

I understand why, now wit my hands tied
Dey take shots cause if I'm out there it?s a landslide
But revenge is best served as a cold dish
And suckas will get served nigga, no shit

Guess it was understood, for me it was over with
But I don't quit if ya ain't notice yet
They couldn't wait to say good night shawty
So they can try to rhyme, act and look like shawty

Go get a beat from Toomp and make a hook like shawty
Before ya know it I'm back, what it look like shawty?
I lost my partna and my daughter in the same year
Somehow I rise above my problems and remain here

Yeah and I hope the picture painted clear
If ya heart filled with faith then ya can't fear
Wonder how I face years and I'm still chillin??
Easy, let go and let God deal wit it

Assault and batteries, but my trunk stay ""ever ready""
Assault and battery if you scared you never ready
And yeah I went green, and 26's on the hybrid
Smoked so much green that I can't open up my eyelids
Wake up in London, go to sleep on Atlanta time
Still my paint got more candy then your valentine
For 5 mill I bought a lake front crib
Bentley car cover looking like a laced front wig

Now 50 thou says that I'm the first nigga with it
First round draft pick, later for you imbeciles
The car is all black like it got traded to the timberwolves
And I keep a little bit of that green up in the lining
But as the weather change my weed adjust to different climates (ok)
Green in the summer time, orange in the spring
Now it's black with that purp I call my whip the ""sac king""

In cahoots with corporations making major change
With magnificent watches and amazing chains
Plush pad in Atlanta and l.a.'s the same

An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.

Now I prove again that I can make life move again.

On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

And through foggy London town,
