DJ Khaled,"When you say in your mind that it's all the time
And you hope that you floated through the larger line
On the gaudy side of town
On the gaudy side of town

I'm not your money man
A thin coated satellite
And you wouldn't leave me, would you dear?
Not tonight
We see your back and forth
Fear in the company now
Put some fear in the company now
Don't lose your cold dear
Fear in the company now
Keep it right

She come in alone
A firestorm
Waitin' on a spark
Leaving me alone she feels it after dark
Keep it down boys
The fire inside
Figure it out sort it out
Your foot in the mouth",Bullet
DJ Khaled,"Khaled check this out right.
I know we global now, world wide 305.
But I see that they are trying to bring down the movement.
I'm telling everybody in the crib they can bet on me.
One time, new Diaz. (that's right)

Put your money where your mouth is, bet on me. [Repeat: x4]

[Chorus]
Tell them boys to keep running that shit out they mouth,
I'm the guard of my city, can't knock me down like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Don't talk about it, be about it hey)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Don't talk about it, be about it hey)
Tell them boys to keep running that shit out they mouth,
I'm the guard of my city, can't knock me down like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Don't talk about it, be about it hey)
You're back won't last with checks you cant cash.

Keep disrespecting, in the the everglades they'll find ya,
I'm not from San Fransisco, but the chopper of forty ninya.
I grew up listening to Lou, and, and, and pumping Trick
Them boys done open doors, so respect is owed.
I got love for Rick, and congrats you made it,
I was a fan from the mix tape you sold me at Foxy Ladies.
I seen them trying to bring you down, but f**k that dog you one of the greatest!
Khaled mix 96er, but even back then though you had haters.
I remember the Temple at Oynx, I was too drunk to get in,
I was still outsider selling Chronic you know gettin it in.
I remember Ump beating the rape mistrial, celebrating the win.
Yall can try to stop Miami but this shit will never end.

[Chorus]

One time TS, two times Fat Joe.
I remember them boys in Wynnwood hood stack short.
I remember them Cash Money Boys in Little Haiti, all running with zozs.
Banana Azuri, soft drop top that's for sure.
Flo Rida, Groundhogs always show love before.
Dammit been paying dues, now its my time to blow.
Even when 50 come through, he don't roll no less than 50 zozs!
Cause they will push your shit back, way back to trues and vows.
My dog Nose shaker, come through the block on something clean.
Sounding like an earthquake, he is what these dope boys dream.
Hit a lick, flip a brick, snatch a Brinks truck.
That's them Miami boys don't get it mixed up.

[Chorus]

I'm Mr. 305, I'm a part of Miami's Heat.
I grew up in all types of neighborhoods, I am Miami's street.
Low key and stay quiet, that's how these chicos in Miami eat.
I love it when these boys come from out of town and thinking Miamis sweet.
All of them down looking for pussy , trying to Miami skeet.
That's when they run up in they hotel room and give them a Miami treat.
When the choppers start a raining, its hard to stop a Miami leak.
That's what they get for thinking Miamis just Miami Beach.

[Chorus]

Ha, You know how this ain't a neighborhood right?
Don't let your mouth write a check your ass can't cash
If the moneys on the wood, its all good.
But if the moneys out of sight it going to be a fight.
And the last thing you want is a fight with the 305,",Defend Dade
DJ Khaled,"It's so incredible
Yeah, it's the DJ Khaled, Khaled, Khaled
I do this for the projects
I got the mothafucking gutta on this track
I got the projects on this one

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who you calling
Nothing can save you now

Shotta youts will run up in your apartment
So unno betta mind where you walking
Goddamn man, can to your target
Nothing can save you know

See you dun push the wrong button
And cross the wrong line
Stepped on the wrong shoe
Muthafucka, it was mine

Time and time
They get me out the tandem
Me are da true, I traded mine in
For caveman king

You don't wanna fuck with
The Southside Gotcha boys
Y'all ain't know trill ass niggas
Y'all some boxy boys

And pull shots on boys
Scattered like a roach
And put that on the fifth
I'm the nigga you don't wanna approach

I was raised in the heart of the jungle
The belly of the beast
And this lick here sweet, I'm so flawed
You can put me on the front line
Ass back nicks, I don't represent the gun shy
Thing about the street life

Homie, I live, wear my heart on my sleeve
And niggas gotta fear life
From the bottom to the top, east to the west
All I gotta say is Khaled, nigga we the best

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who you calling
Nothing can save you now

Yo, bdah, bdah, bdah
Khaled, go let me see 'em
Hand me the fucking clever
'Cause I got a fucking fever
For all the evil Kinevel people
Who try to stunt

Call me Danny Glover
I'm lethal this ain't no sequel
Shoot you people while you sleeping
The grim reaper is out to lunch
Nothing can save you now

Put holes in you mouth so you can't be found
And Khaled got my back
He gon' shoot a hundred rounds
So say hello to death
If you ever in my town

I came from the eggs of a goddess
And the balls of a gigolo
All I had was 2 ounces
An old Chevy and Figaro
Blood shed apart my feet

And bad vibes got a nigga rocking voodoo deep
Lord forgive me, I know not a better way
And pop has tried to stick me
Damn I need some better ye

Ring the alarm, tell 'em people come, come
Look at what the fuck the Briscgun, yeah
It's the final warning

Khaled, these niggas talking
I'm an orphin
And leave a hole in his head
Like a dolphin
Fuck a hole in one, ain't golfin'
I'ma put his whole unit in a coffin

'Cause any nigga fuck wit my pocket
I'ma open his ass off, like suicide doors
Any badass niggas, y'all scared of that lake
I'ma tell you once don't be scared of the Dre

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who your calling
Nothing can save you now

I'm usually cool, but know I gotta bet back
I tried telling ya, ain't wit'cha death threats
I let my nigga know, tell 'em go hammer that
And it ain't gon' take all day
We know where you live at

I'll bet ya hide from ya neighbors
Keep 'em mad shawty
That's how we kill 'em babies
Holla Khaled, and tell him I'm on the way now
I just had to hit a lick in the A-Town

Look at me it's shawty
So bossy, and I don't feel like that
Can't stop me now, now, now
You see what's happening?
Big shit dun popped off
I'm the best nigga, you can ask Khaled
I'm the best nigga

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who you're calling
Nothing can save you know

Shotta youts will run up in your apartment
So unno betta mind where you walking
Goddamn man, can do your target
Nothing can save you know

And if I feel something I'ma try
Figured you winked at me not just something in your eye

That was E40 who said tell me when to go
I know I got the green light

Let it be house, yea the comfortable places
Married to the game on a prenuptial basis
Khaled, he the best in the game when he break it
She the baddest in the club, and I'm willing to take it
We got a lot 'o dollars, gotta be willing to make it
And if you wanna baby might just be willing to taste it
Boss, I'm thugging and she loving it
Gotta have protect one, sipping on that bubbly
Its hard not to notice me, we known globally
Sitting on the top of the world just so comfortably

We can do that, there, just gimme the go
Been a player unprepared, everybody grown folks
'Round here, them gold bottles hold them up
Then we can say, cheers (Let's take a toast)
No wheat or white bread in my Pillsbury dough
Just give me the right head with the letters G-O
All eyes if you like your momma, lame as a video
Imagine you and other kitties(?) strolling all over the city

I know you see me staring girl
I see you looking at me
Go find and it's apparent girl
You feeling luck in the street

Pull strings like a violin
Then I cross over like I'm Iverson
To Z100 out to Ireland
White chicks is standing on line
Black chicks is standing on line
Don't discriminate, I disintegrate
So much cake, maybe we can get away

Fuck the best we run this game
Kanye West Khaled and Pain

[Chorus]
If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you were as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in your yard
Makin' money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live you gots to go on
I am gettin' it in until the end I got to go, go, go, go hard

Sea sick
Got your hand out don't look at me bitch
You lookin' at who made me rich

With the top off lookin' for a girl with a ass as fat as Tracy Ross's
This is dope as is get
Dope as a mother fuckin' acid trip

This finna' be another classic bitch
Everybody know I got if you want it then get at it
But I ain't goin' have it
No I ain't goin' have it

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
I ain't never been scared
Never been a type to bite my words
When I came up ya'll gave me shit
Now I'm finna make ya'll eat them turds
Always said what the fuck I felt
Goin' head spit that murder I wrote
Man I don't care what you felt fuck you nigga I know I'm dope
Dope like I'm comin' to get my all
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall
Felt like niggas was stuntin' on me
Funny how I'm flyer then them all
Now I'm at the top ain't know where to go now
Instead of men she goin' go down
Maybe I would of slowed down if I knew what I know now
I'm Scooby I know I'm dumb
It cud get fuckin' old but it's good I'm young
But my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be number one
I guess it's gon be what it's goin' be
But here's one thing you got to hear
I'm a tell you like George Bush told me
Fuck yall niggas I'm out of here

Money fall out the sky when I speak
Gotta valet, can't leave mine in these streets
Can't carpool, the crew is too deep
Why tuck it all in? The jewels are too sweet
You should ball if you could
I be diggin' in my pockets
It ain't trickin' if you got it
And since a niqqa from the projects
Champagne out of a can would be the fly sh!t
And I'm a history major
Hood motivational speaker
Rap Led Zeppelin, best dressed list
Show you how to bubble off of large investments
Ya heard me, and this journey I'm the journalist
Line around the block to hear the words of the herbalist
Send ya girl to the Dominicans to perm her shit
Tell her tonight, we gonna see Nas return to his murder shit

It's still Nasty, bone in the flesh
God's son, never gone, never left
King, I play every card in the deck

Chopard wrist band
New York crown jewel
No if and's
Top five, I'm the one, two, three, four
And the fifth man
Smoke a hookah in Istanbul
I'm quicksand
I'm 5 Mics, five points of light
Hit the stage like a meteorite
They wanna all hear Ether tonight
But we ain't beefin' tonight
That's history
So now when you mention me
Say I'm a mystery
Like six degrees or the seven hills of Sicily
I need a vasectomy
They resurrected me
But nothing is left for me
Just when you thought you'd seen the best of me
I take it a notch higher, yeah
Sip more wine than a Somalian
Get around town in a private Lear
And by sun down, I'm up out of here

It's still Nasty, bone in the flesh
God's son, never gone, never left
King, I play every card in the deck
The whole world waitin' for what I'm goin' do next

We have a power

Power, paper, palace is so high
Lookin' over skyscrapers, wildin' out in Dubai
Do I look like I never seen the better things?
Emerald ring, I chase cheddar mean
Pockets on swole since eighteen years old
Gettin' my dough, cigars are hand-rolled
From Guantanamo, Gallardo's, the car shows
The Narco Gestapo Optimo's
Cause I love the dough
More than you know
Still ain't reach the pinnacle
Braveheart general since 9-4
Got the belt to show
Certified classic
9-6, Street Dreams is blastin'
And no way, they wanna hire assassins
They still harassin'
I'm so platinum, it's natural
A niqqa is my acronym
Lights, camera, action and

Hey yo Cali
Walk with me
Yeah that's what got me here
The chucks the khaki suits
All the swap meet years
The six dollar socks the five dollar rocks
Uncle Greg rest in peace he taught me how to chop
That's why I love the hood and everything we got
From the ice cream trucks to the forty ounce tops
All white Air Force Ones to fake Jacob watch
A few reasons why I drive the Bently hard top
Use it in my songs cause I live it on the block
Tattoo it on my face let the whole world watch
I'm that type of nigga y'all made my city bigger dog
Turn the TV off got tired of watching Jigga boss
So we told our mom's we was looking for jobs
When we was really in the record store looking for Nas
Project of the ghetto, Ghetto and the project
From Compton to being Dre's number one prospect so

[Jadakiss]
Yeah ugh
They know
Yeah ugh
Ain't no help there just food stamps
Weight checks and welfare
Every man gone for self there
Still might need to borrow your medicade card for health care
Yeah if you never got knocked then you made it
Everybody know each other if not they realated
You can get shot or get bladed
There's dudes that got jobs now that had blocks in the eighties
Six months five years for you just to cop out
Ninth or tenth grade is usually when niggas drop out
Fights break out when you wired and start joking
A lot of OG's retired and started smoking
House party games of spade sweet kool-aid
Loud music all night till the boys in blue raid
So therefore I could never be too paid
I know where I'm going and where I'm from will get you laid

[Chorus]

[Trick Daddy]
Tell me this how come
Black folks get a little doe
And forget where they come from
Man we used to have good times
But since you moved on up you aint cool with us
We still support you tho we dont see you much
You ain't the first fool its cool with us
But why you living out your idols dreams
Remember how for you came and help you keep those things
Now its cool that your address changed
But I'm trying to holla at my dog and the number ain't the same
I guess new homies came with his fame
But see true homies will stay the same
Through all the up's and down's in your career
A couple wives few kids scattered here
And when you dead or broke without a deal
All the groupies cleared, The ghetto will still be here

Come so victory is here
We can celebrate

OK, I'm on my grizzle
On my grind
Go ahead try, top my shine
I'm on my way, anyday
Tell them niggas better have my cake

Victory is on the way
Khaled go in on 'em
Show 'em we gonna win homey

So you think a nigga pussy cause his ear's pierced
Run up on a nigga if you want to
You gotta vest i gotta a shell that'll go through
Ball Greezy gettin' money like ya 'posed to
Good dope in the drop like soul food
Big Body, big rims on the old school
Stay fly like a hood nigga 'posed too
Lights off click clack in the pinto
Seat back, dick sucked in the Benzo
5 percent D-B's on the Renzo
No sleep, gotta eat, gotta get done

It's like I always say
Motherfucka' here I come
Another victory for the crib
A couple more before I'm done
And if you asleep you better wake up
And get on your fuckin' job
Cause I'm takin' everything except a loss
Iceburg goes off, yeah 24-7 I goes on
And I be scared I might miss money
So I don't doze off
I'm a snap and the streets know it
Trick told me keep goin'
An I'm a keep Chiefin' as long as God keep the weed growin'

[Chorus]

Switch man been to a ?
I've been destined to shine
Won't take no for an answer
Fuck nigga gimme mine
Never been selfish for real
I put on my whole city
I went from standing on corners
To autographin' titties
My daddy gave my Virginia's King, A Richmond legend
A wise speaker, a woman pleaser
Broke nigga, reverend
Mr O-10, I get it in

We da best, tell 'em fuck next

You got da cash, then show me
Better not be phoney

You ballin' Balogna
Girls ask me what my cologne is
Steel Khakis and Coronas
And I'm mackin' a donkey
Flip the 4 and a half
Do the vert and a left
Bet da Ave never seen banks chunky as dat
Why you got pressure?
Cause my Impala got pressure
Beating outside, shaking the dice on my dresser
Is that gun play, Yes Sir!

Cop a bird, then your really seein progress

Say my name, rappers lookin like a bomb threat

Brain from your ? till she render me unconscious
I'm so conscious of DNA in my closet
My show account can't take another deposit
Ladies heartthrob labelled me the odd ball
3.5 cause I'm known to start small

To fucking dope hoes and houses with beach fronts

Miami's red cross when they need me I'm there

I'm ten years ahead of the game, I know it ain't fair
Used to go to Santa's Enchanted just to pull on Santa's beard
Sat on Santa's lap and showed him some crack
And told him for Christmas all I want is coke that comes back
Something about a 75-K a show,
Next year it will be 300 per show yeah fo sho
Pits always had it on lock
I'm from the bottom bitch y'all can keep a fucking top
My dog dammit bout to jump out a ten year bid

Now it's victory

Whatever it is, I'll pay the cost
I'm willing to risk it, I'll take the loss
I'll put it all on the line (put it all on the line)
In a hustler's state of mind

I'm gonna make history (yeah, yeah)
Just so we can claim victory (Victory)
Oh, victory (Victory)
(Nasir!)

Speedboats, three tokes and pass it
Grass lit, hittin' slopes in Aspen
No coat, just an oath to stay thorough 'til we back to ashes
Driven in fly sedans to the M-G-M Grand
Picture lots of sand, two blonds, implants
Remy in hand, we tryna tan, deal my cards with an honest hand
A modest man, aware of any counter-scam
Palm trees, magnum Don P's, L-V monograms
Hottest girls flew from Rio
Mojitos, mucho frio, my libido
Sex so strong, without the E though
Hollow threats, we don't see those
Higher death toll whenever we roll
That process is pivotal
My pitiful poverty-struck criminals will get a Jew
Then we lounge in a Spanish-style house
'Til it all blows over, Dolce Gabbana out
Contemplatin', there is no bond with Satan
Say a little prayer for me like Aretha Franklin
For my hustlers, here's some motivation
He who has begun is half done, why you waitin'?
I'm too impatient to pray, too much patience for stress
It's too much paper to rest, fuck around, you face death
I know some niggas from Astoria
That'll cut your daughter up
Like I used to cut a quarter up
Makin' all the bucks, banana clips I bought in Georgia bucks
Kill all you fucks, easy
I be on the golf cart, sleepy
Y'all beneath me
Y'all be at the pawn shop, pawnin' watches
Obnoxious, can't stop us, we shottas
Say you killin' Pablo? Impossible
Nonsense, preposterous, bizarre at best
Unfulfilled promises
I feel intelligence is my wealth
However, how enormous is Nas' pockets is a pop quiz to gossipers
See me at the Oscars, lookin' dreamy, hood opulent
Means esoteric, how I wore it
Exoticness makes you curious to see how serious my closet is
Shareholders wanna invest in that Nas stock, it's just
We be on that real shit, luxury four-wheel shit
Niggas actin' thirst on some just-got-a-deal shit
Ha, for that victory we will kill shit
Get out the way, playboy, this is real shit
(Khaled!)

Whatever it is, I'll pay the cost
I'm willing to risk it, I'll take the loss
I'll put it all on the line (put it all on the line)

You know I can't stop, can't stop, I won't stop, I won't stop

Put your hands up in the air

Sticks on deck, Stunna island, private jets
Put the house on junior nigga we place the bet
From hundred G's to flippin' hundred, bitch we hit the liq'

Smashin' in the field, a hundred balls fall
You know how we do it, bossin' up brand new

DJ Khaled,"I am the streets, the future
I introduce you to Ace Hood, Meek Mills
Big Sean, Wale, Vado, this the future
They gettin' money, they makin' hit records, they hustlin'

Okay now Khaled told me kill 'em, he just told me kill 'em
Hundred for the Beamer, Kudos for the dealer
Murder, bet I wrote it, Kudos to the killer
Chevy sittin' crooked, teeth on Reggie Miller
I'm a motherfuckin' beast, see me in your sleep
Nightmare on any street, swear I will mark any beat
Spread this to the industry, lyrics like a chopper piece
Flow right through your fitted T, pull this through with chemistry
Hottest nigga 'round, they saying greatness is my tendency
No such thing as sympathy, more money, my remedy
Pockets on, heavy D, bitch I'm hot, third degree
Whip I drive? Owned by me, wrists and neck, anti-freeze
Can it be? I'm who you dying to be'
Last of a dying breed, I'm Siamese
Twin pistol shooter nigga like a 7B
Big dog, get it, you still on your pedigree
Yeah, fly nigga with some stupid swag
Dead faces keep my money in the body bag
And the G-U-T-T-A, hops in the whip and I gotta get paid
Fuck them bitches, ain't trying to get laid
Walk in my house you can meet my maid
And you give a damn you can push that Lac
Push that Benz on, push that 'Lade, hop to the whip
No top on mine, hear a nigga hate, man fuck them guys
Real nigga shit, don't tell no lie
Private plane, my seat recline, top 10 charts, where I reside
Got me a house ?

We the muthafuckin best, word to my mama
Ridin' presidential, got me feeling like Obama
'Cause all I want is change
And my niggas they wanted the same
I wanted the money and never the fame
I turned into something they never became
Through all the rain, I kept my flame
And I kept burning and its my turn and
Real nigga my hood confirm it
Now it's 6 2's on closed curtains
And that Maybach, let me take em way back
When I was starving that was payback
Nigga where that cake at?
Murder all your artists
And I, I, I, I can feel that love,
But I feel that hate
When I got that ? I just feel so safe
I put it to your mug, you ain't gon' wake
When that thing gon' fly
Got a little kick, but it ain't no tired
Niggas talk murder, but they ain't gon ride
Now we goin' hard like I ain't gonna die
Meek Mill!

Do it! OK
Smoke until I got no lungs
Got her going down, no teeth
I call it ""speaking tongues""
Do it! Do it!
Now you speaking my language
From where they twist and talk with they fingers
Man but this ain't no sign language
Fresh out of the ashes
This a Detroit fucking classic from when MM got the masses
Trick Trick got them passes
Bitch I'm from the Motor, Motor
Yeah that motor be the fastest bitch,
They call it Motor City
'Cause you're most likely to crash (fuck it)
Good thing I got a chauffeur
Going broke? No sir!
Bitch I'm the rap game stylist,
'Cause I gave the rap game style bitch
But I over shine, ain't no niggas over Sean
Toll rollin by the quarter so I guess we're going overtime.
'Til we're Dumb high, dumb high
Westside, bitch I run mine
I'm rolling around in my old school, I feel like the alumni
Fucking hoes, no strings attached
So don't ask me why they strung out
I'm like Jordan to you niggas
I might even stick my tongue out
She wiggled and wobble, bobbled
Then landed on my throttle
Bitch, I might make you my baby
And even buy you a bottle
Yo niggas don't ask how the top feel?
When you keep em' right beside you
My pockets got paper on paper
This shit just look like a novel boy
100 thousand worth of ice on me now
But it don't feel half as good
As grandma saying she's proud

Forever dedicated, Maybach poetic genius
Some think they close to seeing me
Tell em they close to Stevie
You poser niggas ain't supposed to be here
We don't believe ya.
Double MG'er, we put a wreath on niggas' careers
We the best, Khaled
No need to stress, Khaled
Know there's a lot of artists
But I got the best palette
Multiple colors, my mind's more productive than others
Murray the winner, he think he really
Nelson Mandela
That's fire though.
One time for the 305, though
That hydro make me tired, yo
My kickin be so Tai Bo!
My balance be so tight rope
That's hard to find Quick Tri-Flow
Get rough With me, that Night flow
Hoes blow for me, I maestro, shit
That white whip sit
Like a slight wrist slit
Suicide shit, you can by shit if you write this shit
Nigga and right this minute, they say I'm buzzing hard
My driver's out of this world, you playing bumper cars.
You niggas under-cards
You should be unemployed
All you smoke is Reggie, I'm in the telly bunch of noise
Who gon' tell me that I ain't going or I ain't flowin'
Young Folarin, you see them puters
That was my influence

The towers fell, turning to Ground Zero
Kids didn't like Reggie Jackson
Nicki Barnes their hero
As I play Rothstein, Corleone like Rob De Niro
Been through it but here though
Don't move with the weirdos
Dress pimpin' the toast like let's win
Penthouses on West and 4th, pipes and Mac 6
While me in a Maserati bricking his best friends
When I die, tell them to turn my coffin to stretch Benz rims on it
Problems? My man's on, see him, we stomp him out
His mouth, our Timbs' on it
Always smoking a ounce, a mountain, no tens on it
Spins on it, you have no clout, the Benz on it
What the fiends say?
Few roaches, you need spray, on tours, eat straight
Making sure all your feet sprayed
Get the pills through, peel through SRT-8 truck on, seats gray
Drop tops like release dates, Vado",Future

Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great
Even though I'm  out on bond I might be facin' eight's
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London as she screams

We live the type of dreams you wish for in the afterlife
But all that they can see is velvet ropes and flashing lights
Not everything is lavish life 
but in the mirror all I see is all the nights I had to fight
It's so ironic all I had to sacrifice 
but now I got the money I get everything for half the price, damn

DJ Khaled,"About to change the game
DJ Khaled!
We the best forever
Cash Money, Young Money
I'm for real about this shit
Let's go

[Chorus]
I'm countin' my time, cause my time is my money
The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing
I close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone (Gone)
I'm lookin' at the clock like yay yay
Maps to my treasure, yay ay
(Time's on the side, whoa)
I close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone

They say sleep is the cousin of death, guess we related
Cause I'm the most slept on, and the most hated
Hated by niggas with no hustle
Starin' at me in the club like I won't bust you
In the face with the spades, life is a card game
And I'm playin' spades, gamblin' with y'all change
Fuckin' basketball wives, while you at away games
Really fuckin' basketball wives, ain't gotta say names
Whole body tattered like a New York City freight train
Niggas get to barkin', put a bullet in the great Dane
Try me, end up like Rolly
Team full of animals, like I coach the heat
Four floor mansion, close to the beach
Six car garage, this how I'm supposed to eat
In Miami, rolling up kush on boat decks
Flaggin' down the waitress, wavin' my Rolex

[Chorus]

Yo, I don't survive the test of time doin' this shit so long
And only rest to rise again homie, I sleep when I'm gone
Look, a legend while I'm prime, and so current and they hate this
The streets classified me as another level of greatness
I don't fight for crowns at all, I let whack niggas bitch
And let 'em flip while they debate on who the king of this shit
Listen, see I don't waste time debatin' over those things
Because I'm God motherfucker, God create kings
Watch it, I'm hearin' that a lot of niggas mad through the grapevine
The piano soundin' beautiful and sad at the same time
The feelin' of a funeral, so study you niggas
Khaled, provide the theme music while I bury you niggas
Now there's no escaping the God, you better find a get away
'Fore I start wiling like Haitians and Jamaicans when it's Labor Day
Khaled, every time you know we gotta make 'em love it
And realize every thing is hotter when we touch it

[Chorus]

Ayo Khaled, let this shit breeze

Poor lil' rich nigga, that's me
Smoke comin' out the sunroof, blowin' on hasheesh
Can't stop now, cause I'm in too deep
One point five wide, every two weeks
Niggas wanna kill me, let the shells fall out
Life insurance in place, my kids gon' ball out
They kids gon' ball out, twenty years from now, pullin' cars out
You gon' think cocaine gettin' hauled out
Ass gettin' chipped in, crystal meth gettin' dipped in
All cause you let a nigga slip in
Aftermath, ""0"" five, G-Unit, ""0"" six
Everything else is gymnastics, watch the dough flip
Sittin' on the couch, smokin' up memories
Pourin' Jack Daniels, toast to my enemies
Fuck beef, nigga I ain't got the energy
Take the last shot to the dome, John Kennedy

I’m so serious!

One, two them boys coming for you (Huh!)
Three, four, better lock your door  (Huh!)
Five, six, hide your bitch (Woo!) (Ayo Yeezy, pop your shit)

They said, thou shall not be ill, thou shall not feel
Thou should not be trill, not be drill, not be real
Niggas selling packs, niggas flipping pills
They got heroin and cracks, man these niggas hot for real
Every year gon be our year, every year gon be my year
These niggas really is out here, these niggas really is out here
The block is at war, post traumatic stress
Ran up outta pills, rob that CVS
Niggas getting bust over ""In God’s We Trust""
We believe in God but do God believe in us
If we believe enough, will we ever get to know 'em
That lean got us dozing, we forget that we the chosen

I’ve been poppin' shit for too long
But still reppin’ where I came from
I guess it’s how I came up
I wish you would try to play us

I wish you would nigga (Woo!)
I wish you would nigga (Woo!)

I wish you would nigga (Huh!)
I guess it’s how I came up
I wish you would try to play us

My money on a another level
In the streets I hear ‘em hotter than the fucking devil
I wonder how I got a hundred in my fucking bezel
G5, make it rain, I can change the weather
We fly them niggas lame, where your fucking cheddar?
Aim at your brain, AK be the fucking letters
Fuck niggas fall in alphabetical order
Frank Lucas fur, the cap run more than a quarter
I’m at the fight, ringside, right next to promoters
All my niggas still hustle consider ‘em roguish
I remember catching buses just bought me a Lotus
All your codes get decoded, know the niggas you quotin'
Huh, my corner will scorch ya, somehow my flow is the coldest
Money, power, respect, the only thing’s truly important
Family first, Khaled we gotta stay focused
""God Forgives and I Don’t"" pussy niggas unnoticed

I wish you would nigga (Woo!)
I wish you would nigga (Woo!)
I wish you would nigga (Woo!)
I wish you would nigga
I guess it’s how I came up
I wish you would try to play us (Huh!)

I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga
You see you got a couple cases, still look good nigga
You see these niggas’ll try to play ya, know how ya feel nigga
Eh yup, that’d be the day you wanna kill a nigga
But you gon' chill nigga, just for your kids nigga
Cause now there’s kids doing grown man biz' nigga
You just got home nigga, you tryna live nigga
Me I don’t wanna do another 5 years nigga
The boss is testing yo ass, the feds’ll question yo ass
They be drug testin’ yo ass and then they pray you don’t pass
And then you look in the sky, you got some questions to ask
With no response make you wanna grab the tech and the mac

'Cause they been poppin' shit for too long (Woo!)

DJ Khaled,"Talk about it, make em talk about it
Life to me is currency, prosperity I got it
And your life to me is lifeless like its livin' on life support
I license everything in my wallet, lightest boy with the biggest heart
Nigga play your part or parallel park your ego next to me and violence
Next to me is definitely no one, I'm one of one
And I musta won that from anybody who had it or better yet forgot it
Mack in the back of a 'Lac with a mac in the back of a 'Lac
With a latch on the back of the trunk
Hit a punk in the back with a pump in the back, till he's off balance
And I'm back in the front of the front of the future when you are mentioning talent
And I'm in the back in the back of the block with a cop wanna cop anybody's allowance
Iraq on the block G watch for the block or whatever
And cut no cut more guns more guts fuck boy you fucked up twice you fucked considerin' you drownin'
Die in a lake with a date with a catfish back flip head first smilin'
C-cry in the face of Jesus we just pray we keep on stylin'
On you bitches TDE YMCMB business bitch

Okay nigga riding in a May-be, and I'm probably with baby
Don't talk nigga fuck you pay me, intercept your bitch like Bailey
Okay big money on this side, 100 grand for the whip my bitch drive
Need a new safe money getting too high, dead presidents all in my Levis
Boy I swear this nigga be swagging, and I'm living lavish
Might cop me an Aston, Martin on 'em
Anything I drive I own 'em, bad bitch and that ass ain't normal
Gotta put that pound game on her, beat it up she deep in a coma
I'm super paid, 2 shows a day
My rollie gold, no time to waste
What it do Berg, my fuckin' brother
Keep that pistol by me like my lovely momma
Hot as the summer, cold as the winter
Stay on them charts, I heard that they plotting my timber
Young nigga, got a lot of flows
Any nigga don't believe me, I make it look easy easy out of control

Box full of choppers, hand on the trigger
Uptown gangsta, get it how we get it
Third Ward soldier, suicide rider
Militant minded, hundred mill on the counter
Hand pearly rug nigga, flame on the Bugatti
Christian Louboutin, Chanel for my models
Higher than Bugatti nigga, fishing on the fish scales
Nose diving for them hundreds, strapped up making mail
Fr-fresher than I been before
Higher than we even been, shining on them 24’s
Junior doing time ho
On the grind ho, while he doing time ho

Ya know!
The time is money and money still was made baby
Eight months ain’t stop nothing nigga
It’s like jail was third base and my lil’ nigga still came home, ya understand

I’m from the hood where bitches hold coke in they baby diapers
That’s why when the babies grow up damn they be like us
I came a long ways from rhyming up in crazy cyphers
Man I’m so happy my lil’ brother came home from Rikers
Shout out to BP, Thugga, Flow and Fail Boy
My flow Lucifer, I spit hell boy
My heart numb, ain’t no pain I can’t withstand
And I hold my niggas down boy like a kickstand
Get off my nuts, stop acting like a bitch fam
Lil’ nigga finish puberty, grow ya own dick damn
I went from watching time fly on Earl and Red porch
To cruising through the streets of Miami in a red Porsche
Me and Stunna fly, we should join the Air Force
Stand up niggas, the fuck you brought them chairs for?
I went from making money from people with crack habits
To thanking God I’m in a whole ‘nother tax bracket, amen",B-Boyz

Telling the doctor I'm sick, head doctor I'm needing your lips, yea
Proper analogy for it, if I can afford it then I won't ignore it, clear
Cop me a palace and Porsche and right when I floor it that's when I switch gears
Living my life on Uranus, uh, keeping one foot in your anus, uh
The other foot all on your neck, repeatedly stomp 'til I break it, uh

This is K.O.D., now they wait on me
'Cause if I do not arrive, there wouldn't be no showers
Wale, Wale
Hear you talking, but I cannot stay
Chicks evolve, but they cannot stay
I spit the raw, I leave a gay bitch, late
Turn your date to a lake, turn your 8 to a great
Turn a nine to a damn! Without paying for the date
Throw the bait, ain't no John
You done broke the safe just to get those broads
You been playing the Uno but you getting no drawers
And I poke her face and let her hold no cards
I ain't even tripping, or paying these women
Got plenty fish in that ocean and my rod game is so vicious
And my ? was 450, can I used the whip to 550
Now I 62 cause I get the loot, and she's gon' kiss the ring but no wedding

Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
Man I'm too playa for that
Too many bitches in the world right now
That'll fuck around and pray for that
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
I don't pay for no pussy
I won't pay for no pussy
And I ain't buyin' no Gucci
Say I ain't trying to pay for it
I'm a motherfucking G
And I should make these bitches pay me
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
Hell naw man I'm too throwed
Niggas stay getting shows
Make a lot of money, never trick to these hoes

Clap that ass, bitch, turn up
Nigga kill the pussy, call it murder
Swerve in the Murcielago
Me without a foreign car, man that's unheard of
In the Maybach, king with my feet up
Curtains drawn, bitch scream when you see us
?
2500 for the sneakers, dope ass nigga, no beeper
I was 16 with a Beamer
Glock with the watch on Aquafina
Niggas going, hyena
Getting pussy posted up at the deener
Now we pull up, post in Medinas
With light-skinned bitch like Gina
Aston, Martin
Man I'm motherfucking cold like Kesha
Stop signs, Simon says
We don't give a fuck, we run them
Like Tommy Young, been barely men
Man broke niggas, we don't live with them
I don't fuck around, I just fuck her friends
Got eagle doors on that brand new Benz
And a threesome with two twenty twins
I'm rich, bitch

Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
Man I'm too playa for that
Too many bitches in the world right now
That'll fuck around and pray for that
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
I don't pay for no pussy
I won't pay for no pussy
And I ain't buyin' no Gucci
Say I ain't trying to pay for it
I'm a motherfucking G
And I should make these bitches pay me
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it

Bitch I'm Mack Maine
Trick what? Lace who?
Baby girl, that ain't what Maine do
Before I chase you, I replace you
Before I break you off, I'mma break you
Matter of fact, fuck you
Got a hundred chicks on my tour bus
Asian chicks, they adore us
I'm feeling like the nigga on the chorus
(Got this drank in my cup, and I'm 'bout to roll up)
Man this bitch talking too much, dawg
(I done came down, hold up)
Heard a nigga say pimping was dead
I showed them my watch and corrected them quick like, ""Nah, niggas you're scared""
Now go get you some bread
See it's money over bitches, and bread over bed
Tell a bitch that I know Khaled, and she take it to the head
Shit, one go to store for me
Got another one that's trying to ho for me
Hopefully, she bring more hoes to me
And reverse the game and make em bring dough to me

Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
Man I'm too playa for that
Too many bitches in the world right now
That'll fuck around and pray for that
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
I don't pay for no pussy

DJ Khaled!

And if I cry two tears for her
That will be the most that I would give to her
She left me stranded in my nightmares
Taking pictures of my memories she right there
Twisting on the blade in my heart, deep
Always on my mind so I can't sleep
She used to tell me she was all mine
Now the only way I see the broad is online
I'm doing drugs trying to feel you
I'm killing me trying to heal you
I built my whole life around ya
I thought I found it all when I found her
Shopping sprees on whatever coast
How'd you really feel, I may never know
And as I ride through these streets
With my hand on my heat, eyes red from the sweets, I
Realize some things never change
Once in love and it's gone you don't look at it the same, nigga
Fuck love cause she don't live here
I'm soaked in blood but I'm still here
Hip Hop heartbreaks
Straight-laced, deep bass, 808s plus the mixtapes
Got a nigga feeling like I up and let ya
Get away now you all in the lectures
Being studied by the college's professors
Now I regret the day I met ya
(Bitch) I'll be the first one to say it
She ain't the one you want to play with
I fucked Hip Hop

And if I cry two tears for her
That would be the most that I can give to her
I am Joseph, Darryl, Jason, Dr. Dre, O'Shea
And a host of those who passed away
Today I'm Drake, I'm Wayne, 2 Chainz
You say you want to rap, to this bitch you must commit
Then you're a slave to your grave, you won't get out, you cannot quit
She menstruates weekly, her vibe covers keep you warm
But the source to her heart is love, word up, right on
You know how girls are, she love when you licking on her world star
Kissing on her belly, trick on her at Onyx
Confused fans think that she illuminates demonic
But she's the object of my affections, God's essence, God bless her
She bought me Bentleys, Breitlings, made some friends resent me
For writing about my life, they thought I should have stayed quiet
She took me to places I would have never saw without her
And she took me from my girl powder
I doubt I'll ever be the same, hallowed be thy name
Give me strength so I don't do this dame like Orenthal James
Brad warned me while driving this auburn Ferrari
Never follow in her games, I fuck around and I'll be sorry
But I tried her used to ride her, for dollars not the fame
She slowed me down and had me guzzling on cups of lean
She's a middle-aged cougar, showing young'uns the dream
Noticed she wasn't breathing for a second then I screamed
""She's dead!"" and everybody took it out on Nasty
I was just looking out for my music family
Wasn't trying to claim her to myself, she's yours
You can have her she's a motherfucking whore
I fuck Hip Hop",Hip Hop

Nickle plated ruger have you in a box on Worldstar
Duck nigga, duck nigga, duck nigga,
Duck nigga where I’m from you call the fuck nigga
Pistol in the freezer, spend a kilo on the visa
Court side Sportscenter, I can make you a believer
Everybody going broke, keep it real, you gotta fight it
Hundred kilo’s in the beemer, boy don’t make me get excited
Couple milli on the neck like I’m tryna get indicted
Got a mansion, got a yacht, bad bitch and a tiger
Real niggas, taking over televisions
Dope boys riding in a new set of Benzes

Buying all these foreign's, I be in and out the dealer
Just to let my niggas hold on when they rollin', it could kill 'em
And these suckas, I don’t feel 'em
I don’t even see 'em
I’m a die fly, rest in Peace Aaliyah
Half my dawgz dead, the rest of them is here
If all your jewels fake, how the fuck we gon' believe ya
Said I did it for my dawgz, did it for my dawgz
Everybody ridin' till you sit 'em in the morgue
Started with a Bonnie now I’m sittin' in a Porsche
With the shooters right behind me
Shit, you looking at a boss
Rose gold rolie on my wrist, flawless
Hundred bottles send 'em to the VIP, ballin’
Basketball leather in the Benz, Spalding

I did it for my dawgz
Did it for them niggas with a vision like a boss
Did it for them niggas in the kitchen with the salt
Now I’m in that white thing, 500 horses for my niggas in the coffin
But got bikes in my hand and a drop head Rolly
Staring at the ceiling when I wake up in the morning
My dawg doing life, try to see him ‘fore he hit the coffin’
Play with my paper, run up in your offices
It’s the 'o twelve Ice Cube nigga with the Raider hat
A maniac nigga, where the paper at
Highway to life, need a hundred mill exit
50 on the wrist, hundred on the necklace, Montana!

Watch who you smoking with
1.7 in my safe when I open it
If I put 7 in ya face, will I open it
And I know tomorrow ain't promised but I hope it is
Love to get acquainted with you
Stay and tear the jail up
Did it for my dawgz so I had to put the bails up
Get them thangs off so I haven’t put the scales up
Treat you like a pit, get ya ears and ya tail cut
Choppas still hot, you can hold it for yourself
Versace, same buckle on the loafers and the belt
Yeah the pills is flying but the smokers is something else
If the spot catch fire, the coke will just really melt
The dough got 'em bringing in the broads
Obvious the flow got 'em screaming for the lord
If there’s money on ya head what you think is the reward?
I ain't do it for myself, you know who I did it for?

‘Cause I do it, do it, do it
Like it’s no other option
Fat asses, big bottles
When I’m around they both get poppin’
I talk about girls and money
Too much I admit, way too much girls
Too much money, those 2 things that don’t exist
And I think It's so impressive I’m riding in the back
Young and black ’cause I’m chauffeured and not ’cause I’m arrested
Getting richer every year, you can grasp up my progression
Got the finest with her shirt off and skirt off
Showing her blessings

I’m always repping for my gang I stay down
Ain’t gotta go back to my hood ’cause they 'round
And the niggas that’s next to me it’s all the niggas that stress with me
I done made it from the bottom and they say I did it on my own
So to me that’s destiny
If anybody got a problem I just tell ‘em to get on their grind
Try to to see as much checks as me
And my wife is a goddess my tree is the finest
A click full of real niggas that's just the one thing about us
They showin’ us love, but I remember back then the niggas would doubt us
We used to go out but now when we go out all the people surround us
They screaming my name, I’m repping my city it’s me who they proud of
So fuck what the lames about wouldn't me no game without us no game without us

Been talked about and mistreated
Still put in the work that I needed

Model bitches turnin' hoes ’cause a nigga froze
Got them people taking pictures let a nigga pose
'Cause I get paid from reading scripts, you ain't getting shows

Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

If I see it, then you know I'm gon get it
Yeah nigga, for the love of that paper
I got hoes sipping, liquor, six in the morning with it
I’d die for this cream, die for my dreams
As I stay and I fight on the side of the ring
With my back to the rope
Hear the crowd as they scream
But I come out on top like Mohamed Ali, woooo!
These hoes fuck so good
Now Lil' nigga get money now!
Same bitches laughing at me I was dead broke
Gettin' head from 'em thinkin' how funny now!
Brand new Rolls Royce in the summer now

DJ Khaled,"Keep your circle tight
Trust no one, nobody (nobody, nobody, no no no)
DJ Khaled!

Gotta be careful who you trusting
Be aware of your surrounding when you hustling
Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg
All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all
You fuck with dude, he your day one
Almost had it all then the day comes
When they walking through your house with the strap out
Pointing at your head, got the bread then you black out (yeah)
Bright lights down the hallways
Left his best friend for dead for the small wage (ay)
They say that every dogs got a day coming
It's like he seen a ghost but he ain't say nothing
Eyes wide shut like you looking at me
Window pain to the soul say they niggas happy
But the pictures ain't say them words and we dry stomach
The homie didn't keep it one hundred
The cops doing roundups, say they got a suspect
Finally got a name now, I'm still thinkin fuck that (fuck, that)
For money, niggas murder what they close to (get this nigga)
Entire families these mother fuckin' ghost you
Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?
Just prepared for the payback because it strikes cuz
Was it worth what that life was?
Prepare for the payback when it strikes cuz

Cuz when you need it the most ain't no one ever around
Cold world, cold world

Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unaware-able
He fuck around jump off a building if you dare him to
The greats they done already killed him, who you compare him to
Figure out what he said will take a year or two
Family over everything, skills over politics
He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it
Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces
Betrayal is worse than death in most cases
The world is filled with hypocrites that's so racist
Multiple shots to the face, No chasers
Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited
Your man that you grew up with get you indicted
This was your nigga, yo, for him you let the trigger go
Found out at the trial they got audio and video
Shit don't always happen how you plan it
Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is
You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas
That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas
You know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure
You front tryna hold it in, it hurts more
He was right there back-to-back with me, my first war
Even had a crack spot together, the first floor
Used to buzz em in then meet him right by the first door
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces
He was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting
Nothing but old pictures of old sixes
Old BM's with the kids, old snitches
Two sides, both wishes
Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches

See there's a story in my life
There's a story in my pain
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh oh
There's a story in me

Yeah, for life
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't in to making friends
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance
Homie said he 'bout that action they grabbin' me take the stand, damn
Say loyalty make a man, got a homie and he told
I don't even shake his hand, I don't even crack a smile
Knew him since a child, man this game so foul
But niggas made vows to a code I never break
Ridin' in the heavy weight
Thirty-six O's in the bird, call it feather weight
Never on time, when I show up I be ready late
Niggas got fat while we starved they already ate
And I'm trying to get full, masks on clips full
If he got the money we attack him like a pitbull
We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store
On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for
Hah!

My pain ain't never been told (ain't never been told)
All the success that I'm suffering from
Came from this knowledge I sold (this knowledge I sold)
My family fucks with me
And fought the enemy that stood in my way (my way)
That's why I don't trust nobody
And I doubt you'll ever see that day
Where I surrender to you (surrender), surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Which I will never do

'Cause when you need it the most ain't no one ever around (nobody's around)
Cold world (cold world), cold world (mmm, yes it is, yeah)
And the ones that you keep close are the ones will take you down (always take you down)
Cold world (cold), a cold cold world

Where I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Where I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Which I will never do
Oh-oh oh whoa
Oh-oh (oh-oh) oh-oh

See there's a story in my life (Surrender)
There's a story in my pain (Surrender)
There's a story in my tears (Surrender)

I'm a lover not a fighter, I can't find my lighter
My house is four stories, I tell'em I don't write em'
And my living room is white, my lies are much whiter
My darkest secrets are bright I need a sun visor
I say ""187"", make your bitch run my errands
I'm at the bar with a Dracula ordering bloody Mary's
I got a house on the prairie, got a corpse in the basement
I see hell out the window, man this view is amazing
And if I go back to jail, Persian rugs in my cell
Got the world in my hands it got all under my nails
In a room full of stares, give em something to see
I be so fucking faded, who washed the colors with bleach?
Now they biting my style, hope it get stuck in yo teeth
I been had the green light, so don't jump in the street
The World's under my feet, I'm just kissing the sky

Ratchet and Bougie, I like R'n'B
Unapologetic I'm sorry for not being sorry
You niggas old news prehistoric
I need benadryl for my trigger finga, bad bitches for my home boys
The grass is greener on the other side, I'm focused on my own yard
Ain't got enough, need more dough, we twisting blunts like torsos
I'm rich as fuck but more so, a poor soul
Oh well, If snow fell like hoes fell in love I be a snow man
My bitch a die for me, she a soldier, GI Joe-Ann
Take chances when I know I ain't got no chance, roll em
I left that crap table with a chip on my shoulder

Nigga try to run off with some change, I’ma hunt him down
All they do is run they mouth, me, I just run the town
'Cause the industry is being ran by a bunch of clowns
Circus, it hurts ‘cause

She got that booty galore, gripping it, backing me up
You wanna fuck with a thug
Now I see all these bitches got ass and they throwing

And I swear to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth with my hand on the Bible
I lied, I lied, I lied

I swear I swore to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth
And I got up on that podium and lied
Then the coppers swore to tell the truth nothing but the whole truth
And he got up on that podium and cried
Said I tried to take his life
And the judge ain't take my side
'Cause when you black them risk is high to beat that case against them odds
Against them guys, with your last bit of money for your lawyer
My heart dropped when I seen him hit the corner
They was in the black Taurus, Dodge Charger, Explorer
Beat me to the ground and used my blood to mop the floor
But I'mma hold the water like it was holy water
Informants told informants how we had it and they swarmed us, they caught us

I know I told you I stopped slanging yay, strapped everyday
I lied, I lied, I lied
All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't, only you that I be fucking

Only swear by Allah, so when approached by them folks
I spit the truth when I swore under oath
I lied, I lied
Shit, 'cause I don't take the stand on niggas
I rather give it to that man up close
Blocka, blocka
I told my cellie in the jail I wouldn't rap no more
See you when they free you cuz 'cause I ain't coming back no more
Wifey on the highway with them kids driving back and forth
Knowing if a nigga violate that I be back in court
Reside in somebody's federal estate
Niggas jumping on your case is worst than First 48
I seen a rat stand up on his case that wish he told
Come on a pill and give a nigga a will

I know I told you I stopped slanging yay, strapped everyday
I lied, I lied, I lied
All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't, only you that I be fucking

I lied, I lied, I lied

It was we vs. them vs. three then ten
Swore I'd never re again but I lied, I lied
Now the package is enormous
And that come with informants
We already kinda hot so it's stupid to keep it on us
We just being hard headed
Disregarding the drop
Then they bagged him in the cab and brought him back to the spot
Found six p's of piffy a little under fifty
That little bit of bread make the relationship shifty
And it's all my fault he still tryna to convince me
I miss my goddaughter I wonder if she miss me
Birthdays and Christmas I ain't never missed it
Her dad is my brother I love him from a distance

I know I told you I stopped slanging yay, strapped everyday

Dude you don't know me, so you can't drink my bottle
Why when I was gone, you ain't do nothing for my daughter?
Paper plate-living niggas hating 'cause I'm ballin'
Boring his bitch, fucked her and spoiled
You don't wanna see me all I do is make a call
We have no specific victims, we want all y'all
Ridin' for the team, .45 wit' a beam
Plenty murder scenes

Twelve gauge Mossberg, that bitch look like a chopper
If my dogg burst so I hand it to my partner
Heat game chip bitch I'm chilling on the floor
All white head to toe looking like a kilo
Ice machine refrigerator nigga what the hell
What they said about my watch when I spoke to Gabriel
Cash on the Wraith so this shit is not a lease
Hundred cash on the Cuban fuck I need with a piece
Catch you in the streets knock your top off like a Jeep
Then we show up at your funeral and piss all on your wreath
Ride on 'em

I said all these niggas fuck-niggas
And they said they fuck wit' you

And if I set it on a nigga you can bet that I'mma go and hit it
These the laws that we live by
Same niggas that you're looking at the ones you getting slit by
Still moving how I wanna
For a brick whole clique getting left in a coma
White glove it's a deadly game
You gon' fuck top down say my name like Candyman
All I want is real estate
Graduated from the corner 'til I send it up the interstate
Niggas hating on me
But I got a new plug and it got a truck waiting on me

I said all these niggas fuck-niggas

We all got to go through the mud
Remember the sunshine on the other side

First I got to give thanks to the most high
I've been through it all good and bad seen both side
Now we in the sky seem so high
And the view is so amazing that ain't no lie

But you know what they say more money more problems
I guess they mad at us just because we came from the bottom
I feel the rain the storm's coming in
But after the rain we'll be shining again (don't give up)

Don't worry it won't rain forever
I've been through the craziest weather
The world is cold there ain't no one to call on
I thought you would be there for me I was all wrong

You know what they say more money more problems
I guess they mad at us just because we came from the bottom

But after the rain we'll be shining again

I'm here to right my wrongs
I've made a mess again
I'd like to apologize
I'm tryna make amends

That wasn't who I am
Those were my demons

Forgive me, father

Don't even look back on it
You ready for change, better act on it
They look up to you so don't slack on it
It's a blessing, you know that you're talented
Some people don't know what their talent is
What's sad is they don't know what balance is
I ain't been the same since I had a kid
Look out for him and protect where I live
I done got famous for what I did
Rollin' up papers and showin' love, we all in the same
Now the bank come to where I live
Don't hate on another man, no that ain't part of the game
Did it all for the fame
And don't call it a game
Started small every day
We worked hard, and now they call us bosses

And I done seen so many people slow down
I can't relate, I can't relate, no
And I done seen so many people change up
I can't relate, I can't relate, no
When you doin' good, somebody wanna see you doin' bad
I can't relate, I can't relate, no
Just movin' forward, so why they wanna talk about the past?
I can't relate, I can't relate, no

I got visions, I miss fortune all day
What I'm sayin', I, tryna tell y'all
I shake these nightmares all day
How can I give you my mind?
When I try to think, it just race
How can I give you my heart?
When I call on it, it just breaks
I put the city on top
District, V.A. all day
PG MoCo they sweaters
Guess who made MDMA?
Amy Wine to Cobain
Qur'an, Bible or fate
Try not to feel like I'm Robin Will'
Would a hook change my fate?
Why you make me this way?

I'm here to right my wrongs

Pat 'em down, count the money, let 'em see the work (Yeah)
That's the definition of a major key alert
Another nigga gotta die, won't be the first (Nah)
Won't be the last, all we see is cash (Yeah)
Your real story don't match what you rappin' 'bout (Liar)
So keep the movies in, stop actin' out
And I ain't talking 'bout no watch or no cars neither
Everything will get copped at Allah's leisure
Was a crack monster, I had that hard fever
Switch from the bald head to the dark Caesar
Used to be the capsules, now they love the plastics
I ain't tryna get caught up in this thug-rap shit (Never)
Rather be bumper to bumper in drug traffic
Cash on deck whenever the plug ask it
You don't sweat the small things, they become drastic
Next thing is cremation or a casket
Fuck fallin' back, I need all of that
I need my name in the cocaine almanac (Jada)
Real dope boy put me in the hall of smack
Went to job interviews, they ain't call us back
Either way I ain't never evil
Why you think the streets love me? I ain't never leave 'em
My heart stops, but the words are forever breathing
You hatin' 'cause we the best, find a better reason

First thing first don't ever play yourself (Ever)
Oh another thing, I ain't ever play myself (Never)
Even when they all changed up, I stayed myself (It's me)
Did what worked for me, then bossed up and paid myself
See I'm showin' up a K off, gain a Rollie, a day off
Still got that work, I don't know about no layoffs
Team still ballin' so I guess we in the playoffs (Swish)
Team full of baddies, all my bitches in a slayoff
See we be in the party wasted, no part of fake shit
Nothin' but love 'round me, Cartier bracelets
I feel like Frank White walkin' into Arty Clay shit
You niggas got fat while everybody starved
My city don't sleep, I ain't ever noddin' off
When you're in the Benz, it piss everybody off
So I ain't stall, I do me, I ain't y'all
This New York nigga let 'em hang, giant balls
Odell Beckham, respect him, you can't check him (You can't)
Blindside hoes hit me when I don't expect 'em (Hey bighead)
Then I hit 'em with the curve from the major league
Gotta wait your turn, that's a major key

Mami yellin' I'm the greatest
Back to back with the slow cum
In the lane, I got her so strung, I don't even know her
Every night I meet a new wife
Now ask your wife what this dick like
Balmain Joe, every time you see, a nigga flee
Mr. Officer, I was only grabbin' ID
Mami only listen to Romeo
Wild cowboy, I be speakin' through the yayo
'Bout to let the cans go, woah
Fuck your bitch and let your mans know, so
Yeah, now it's the Don in the Don, couple laughs in the Uber
Only drivin' Uber 'cause I'm franchised in Cuba
This is big money talk and you tied to the sideline
Brian Scalabrine, niggas always tryna high five
Gotta stay away from day driftin', all sauce
Every day Vera Wang, nigga, cloth talk

Now I'm takin' over everything like that's my callin'
Wakin' up in pussy like beautiful Sunday mornin'
Now we swimmin' in the money like a line of dolphins
Prepare for the killin', now please line up all of the coffins (Closed casket nigga)
Think we playin'? Niggas think it's funny?
Pop you in your shit, brotha, now make room for the money (Move!)
If you don't make room, I'll beat a nigga past painful
Make a fool of yourself, I'll beat you past shameful
I get this bread and shine like an angel
One of the last with bars, you niggas better be grateful (Thank you so much)
I Diddy bop and drop on you niggas
I count bread and take it to the top on you niggas (Mountaintop)
Blah blah blah blah, you sound alike, my niggas
Blah, blah, but when I do it, I finesse, I got it locked, my niggas
I give you new brand shit, fuck you gon' do?
And know we love the boom bap, oh yeah we do this too
Yeah, fuck with the realer side, oh you against us, nigga?
You better run and hide, until I'm finished, nigga
Don't play yourself
Play yourself and lay yourself dead in a casket
Pray yourself, end in a basket
Hate yourself 'cause you ain't ask if you could possess you a heater
Or you could be you a leader for the people
Talk a lot, I've seen the truth like Sevyn Streeter
Don't you ever play yourself

I saw a lot of niggas fade out right after I put my tape out
I offered to help you shape up, I see that you'd rather flake out
Sellin' stories on them tracks that nobody can seem to make out
That's why I keep a good head and shoulders to keep all the flakes out
Seen a lot of singles chart on and off durin' the climb up
I bet if I had the clippers, they prolly all had a line up
You worried 'bout your followers, so hurt when I follow up
It's the ones with the most pride end up bein' the swallowers
Fuck a beat for a verse when I could do all three
No pop artist but pop is what you rappers do call me
A lot of washed out niggas tryna find hope in
I'm just tryna raise a son like my blinds' open
I know the hood well, but glad I ain't stuck in the streets
I'm pop chartin' but hood niggas got my song on repeat
I'm still loaded with illest ammo up under the seat
I'm playin' hopscotch with all the charts up under my feet
While you do it for the 'Gram, I do it for my Grammy
Fuck a gold trophy, I'm talkin' my mom's mammy
You gotta finish bigger than you start
Or fall victim to bent stories, you ain't even part of it all
Start from the bottom, oh please, or don't start at all
I build a ship just to survive my own flood, I feel like Noah
'Cause all he had was little rocks, an ark, and saw
Road to riches, I'm still in gear while you park your car
Your baby wanna get nailed in the Sprinter Lexus
Text back and told her, ""Please be hammered so you can sex us""
My arm strong, if Louisiana then tell her Texas
And if it's not immediate then don't even send a message
FYI I'll be free 'round 2 or 3
And two things you gotta be, uh, New Orleans
I'm an organ donor, I'm alive with no heart in me
So never say my name in vain, 'cause bitch there's no arteries

I guess I'm on my Don shit
What that mean?
I'mma go

Straight up, late nights mixed with early days
It'll probably be that way until the Pearly Gates
Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break
These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man (Sheesh)
At least if you real then I have to respect it
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested
So understand we positive as could be
The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats
Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach
Khaled on the jet skiis, preaching what you believe in
Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating
If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan
Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers
You know it's true, bitch I need respect due
Now or later, either way I'mma take it, just like it's fuckin' taxes
No wonder I'm on fire, I done been to Hell and back bitch
Lately I been living life in detachment
I practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions
We been all in the Hollywood Hills, and never been acting
Detroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion
Father help us, police doing target practice with real bodies
Mommas in the streets, crying, standing over a still body
Niggas over stressing, we under investigation
Every day off to the races, can't fuck with you if you racist
Beat your ass until you purple, they can't even tell what your race is
Doctor King meet Dr. Dre, except this doctor lost all his patience
Have you tied up in a basement with you and your partner facing adjacent
Until you deposit payment or reparations
If you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me
It feel like I'm finally free and unlock my spirit with the holy key 
(The holy key, the holy key, the holy key)

And I'mma celebrate it for a long time
The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine

Surrounded by my angels and we all shine

Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust (Uh huh)
Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (Come on)
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
'Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said ""Fuck Mother Earth,"" that's PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubix cube
So what you look up to?
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches, sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Who knew Royce's with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason, you won't die in peace
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me
Tape recording my voices and tweak it, let's play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast
I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD
Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need
Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration
But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix

And I'mma celebrate it for a long time
The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key

Blood in the soil is over oil
Cold-hearted, my blood boils
The spoils of war are used to take the drugs out the foil
Man these arms can't reach you, AR's won't recoil
Goddamn, I might marry a heiress and move to Paris
Fuck the carriage baby, let's go disappear and just perish
Thirty karats in the gold
I wear it to cherish the kings from which we inherit
My chariot is McLaren
It's all numeric
Talkin' numbers, you incoherent
Don't be embarrassed, I blame your parents for even caring
Or not aborting, ah fuck it, it's not important
My vital organs can't even tell if it's night or morning
Final warning, final warning, final warning
Every morning you'll awake and await mourning
We earn it then we burn it to ash
I call it urn money
My dog called 40 before he turned 20
Money is earned, the rest is inherited
Hashish come from Marrakech, all my kush is American
Man I feel like a therapist, pistol on me like Maravich
I careless, I'm so perilous with all of this arrogance, goddamn
Money, hoes, that's something that you can't chase

It may sound funny 'til you found out he got punctured lungs
I just want the funds, I don't rap for fun
I rarely post the money, I never pose with guns

Old friends of me turned into my enemy
My money and fame changes niggas into enemies
All my hard work and lonely nights no sympathy
Want to send a hit but too far in the industry
I feel your energy I know you niggas envy me
They rep the gang that bangin' it out in penitentiary
I watch the shit come out your mouth and it's finicky
I'm tryna love you but I doubt I'll scream infinity
With these billions on my mind it's hard to be cohesive
Gettin' that A-Rod money like I hit the needle
Keep a Spanish mamacita like a Fanta liter
And I gave 'em all dope and they pissed off
Got my lil Haiti babies waiting so they can wack ya
I got my Memphis ten niggas waiting to jack ya
I got some DC niggas waiting to kidnap ya

New Porsche, condo, living room cars in it
Ace of Spades with the Percocet and bars in it
Real soldiers, young shooters put they heart in it
They talk 'bout all this money we make and all these niggas they hatin'
Let's talk 'bout runnin' that bag up fast 'cause we ain't got no patience
Let's talk 'bout poppin' strips and xans like we 're patients

Gotta be grateful I never break the promise
I know my plug love me, I know my bitch hate me
I heard my hood salty I tried to tell 'em it ain't my fault
It's just my blessings called me
But since they hatin' on an nigga I'mma keep ballin'
And I ain't textin' that bitch back because she keep stallin'

And when I sleep you're--you're everywhere
You're everywhere

Just tell me how I got this far
Just tell me why you're here and who you are
'Cause every time I look
You're never there
And every time I sleep
You're always there

'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes it's you I see
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone
I'm not alone

I recognize the way you make me feel
It's hard to think that you might not be real
I sense it now, the water's getting deep
I try to wash the pain away from me
Away from me

'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes it's you I see
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone
I'm not alone

I am not alone

And when I touch your hand
It's then I understand
The beauty that's within
It's now that we begin
You always light my way
I hope there never comes a day
No matter where I go
I always feel you so

'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes it's you I see
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone

'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I catch my breath
It's you I breathe
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone

You're in everyone I see
So tell me
Do you see me?

DJ Kid,"I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams
 
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
No not if I tried
 
I thought love was more or less a giving thing
Seems the more I gave the less I got
What's the use in tryin'
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain
 
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
Not if I tried

Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams
What's the use of trying 
All you get is pain 
When I wanted sunshine I got rain 
 
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
No not if I tried
Not if I tried, no

Finally up in this nigga 
On the real all you crab niggas know the deal 
On the real all you crab niggas know the deal 
To my seed May I lead you into no breed of evil 
In the categories and stories I breed my sequel 
You know the money blues blunts broken 22's 
Monkey see Monkey do 
A shorty sipping sunny dew 
Now its V.S.O.P. in a G.S. that's mad smokey 
Murder tree's, Crusin gun in the stash so it won't poke me 
Up in the Marriot, Sweet dirty tint, Don't make no noise cause we dirty 
Tell the ho's to hurry in 
We got the room lit up with perfume, and mad boom 
And there's video taping of booming ass's on the zooming lens 
Rolling on you non descript niggas 
Your marked for death like colombians with bad coke that gip niggas 
Tilt the dutch, twisting up the uwee if your skilled enough 
In Will we trust, salute the dead the nine mili's bust 

[Chorus] 
On the Real all you crab niggas know the deal 
On the Real all you crab niggas know the deal 2x 

Now its verbal abuse cause the mic's in use 
This is your sorry excuse 
Get your neck put in a noose 
K-L is quick to let loose, to make your blood count reduce 
Over the snare drum 
We reproduce like cum 
Impregnating the track, making it fatter than it was 
Giving life to idea 
Through the verse is what he does 

See a close call about two clicks from my fortress 
We rolling squad deep, on the Kawasaki hourses 
QueensBridge got the drop on you niggas trying to toss us 
We metal down now its time to show these clowns who the boss is 
We live for the shit, Ain't trying to take no lossess 
Accumalating to much cream for you to touch 
Fucking welcome to my clutches, wipe the blood on off my chuckers 
From the ruckus 
Your gone and your crew still love us 
Can't call it, I'm in love with this good life shit 
I'm working with jewels, car, chicken clits, paying rent 
Murdered Presidents, running wild, stacking in piles 
Onyx pendants, and Rubied down shit from the nile 
Kamikaze style, sought the antique three pound 
Yo Nas, lets cop this brick and let the mobb supply the town 

[Chorus: x2] 

(Play some treats on us) 
Drugs in my shirtsleeve 
The side bubble converti 
Eyes low cause the lye blow 
Five-oh know we dirty drive slow 
Write a line sipping a glass of wine 
The block is mine cause I am a live criminal mastermind 
When I rhyme, I perfect this, niceness, I'm blessed with 
Exhale precise shine like cocian white 
Its the life of Pablo, Escobar niggas I know 
With diamond rolexes, that drive infinite's and lexus 
So send my enimies a message 
My Tommy Hilfiger vest, is bullet proof, so when niggas shoot 
I'm still protected 
So never ask why I write so violent 
My brain storm formed on a dorm in Rikers Island 
I remained calm while you tried to bite my style and 
When I performed niggas mic's went silent 
To the kid who made my man ill will bless this 
(On the real) 
When I catch up to your ass you know the deal

I lose some sails
And my boss won't be happy
But I can't stop listening to the sound
Of two soft voices
Splendid in perfection
From the reels of this record that I found

Every day there's a boy in the mirror
Asking me what I am doing here
Finding all my previous motives
Growing increasingly unclear
I traveled far and I burned all the bridges
I believed that soon as I had land
All the other options now before me
Will wither in the light of my plan
So I lose some sails and my boss won't be happy
But there's only one thing on my mind
Search in boxes, underneath the counter
On a chance that only tape I find
A sun forth, someone that needs somewhere
To long for
Someone who needs somewhere
To long for.

It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus it never ends, it works it's way inside
If the pain goes on

I have screamed until my veins collapsed
I've waited as my times elapsed
Now all I do is live with so much fate

I wished for this, I bitched at that
I've left behind this little fact
You cannot kill what you did not create

I've gotta say what I've gotta say
And then I swear I'll go away
But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise

I guess I'll save the best for last
My future seems like one big past
You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it

Put me back together or separate the skin from bone
Leave me all the pieces
Then you can leave me alone

Tell me the reality is better than the dream
But I've found out the hard way
Nothing is what it seems

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take

Pushing the barriers planting seeds
Playing the mind guerrilla
Chanting the Mantra peace on earth
We all been playing those mind games forever
Some kinda druid dudes lifting the veil
Doing the mind guerrilla
Some call it magic the search for the grail

Love is the answer and you know that for sure
Love is a flower
You got to let it, you gotta let it grow

So keep on playing those mind games together
Faith in the future out of the now
You just can't beat on those mind guerrillas
Absolute elsewhere in the stones of your mind
Yeah we're playing those mind games forever
Projecting our images in space and in time

Yes is the answer and you know that for sure
Yes is surrender
You got to let it, you gotta let it go

So keep on playing those mind games together

Putting their soul power to the karmic wheel

Witness before all eyes, the evidence of unseen
The power past the comprehension that controls all things
The battle fought by good and evil is a real contest
It is the outcome of the struggle that we play context
To all sets sections cruddy clicks crews and clans
Gilgreens to Badlands, jump up, to understand

My pad and pencil, will transcribe the elemental

Left the rah rah livin alone, about to settle
Fast act tryin to go slow down, and save your petrol
Cause the beat don't stop, like yellow cabs in the metro
Rejoice your verse to Earth, as the verbs connects
This is a daily operation like birth to death
And I burst the breath, yep, as a so-called vet
I've orchestrated designs while they slept, quiet as kept
Everything that you heard in advance is just a glance
Of the landscape, furnish we Crops And props till
Sunsets and Tree-dots, back jobs Of pure skill
At night, I do right, to excite, what truth reveal
Got to believe, that the Most High I see
Every degree, of this three-see-ix-to-e

From troubled projects to the shores of Tripoli

To speak to my beloved, and make em all love it

DJ Licious,"You're the first thing I see when I wake up in the morning
And the last thing I see when I turn off my phone, yeah
I skim through your insta, looking for a warning
I see you with a girl and I'm pretty sure you're on it
I'm in too deep, do you know that I'm sinking
I wait like a fool as I'm begging you to dive in
Lying on my bed don't know what I'm thinking
Hold up, there's a light on my phone and I'm hoping

I hear you calling
I hear you call my name
Tell me you want me
Say that you feel the same
Stay with me, baby
And I will play your game
Say that you want me
Say that you need me

I hear you calling
I hear you call my name
You say you want me
But do you feel the same?
Take it deeper
I never want nothing
Say that you want me
Say that you need me

I hear you call, I hear you calling
I hear you call, I hear you calling
I hear you call, I hear you calling
I hear you call, I hear you calling

You are the one got me sitting on my own head
Playing with my love and don't really want me
When you're up getting down till six in the morning
Wonder how many girls are at home when the phone rings

I hear you calling
I hear you call my name
Tell me you want me
Say that you feel the same
Stay with me, baby
And I will play your game
Say that you want me
Say that you need me

I hear you calling
I hear you call my name
You say you want me
But do you feel the same?
Take it deeper
I never want nothing

DJ Liquid,"Break break down,
Steady breakin' me on down, break break down,
Steady breakin' me on down,
Break break down, steady breakin' me on down,
Break break down, steady breakin' me on down.

You called yesterday to basically say
That you care for me,
But that you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended
To be feeling similarly
And led you to believe it was o.k
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me

[Chorus]
Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath a disguise of a smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
Till I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry

So what do you do
When somebody you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride
And sing ""I will survive""
Do you lash out and say ""How dare you leave this way?""
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away

Yeah, c'mon, yeah, c'mon, c'mon

Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the disguise of a smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
Till I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry

It'll break you down
Only if you let it
Everyday crazy situations rocking my mind
Tryin' to break me down
But I won't let it
Forget it (forget it)

I be feelin' like you bringing me down
Taking me around
Stressin' me out
I think i better go and get out
And let me release some stress (stress)

Don't ever wanna feel no pain (pain)
Hoping for the sun
But it looks like rain (rain, rain, rain)
Lord, I just wanna maintain

Yeah, I can feel pressures y'all
But never the less
Krayzie won't fall
It's over, it's ending here (here)

Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of a smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise

And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry",Breakdown
DJ Luian,"No sé por qué, no quieren darte la oportunidad
Haces que me motives y me provocas sin necesidad 
Cuando estamos solos, tú me miras y me provocas 
Me dejas tocar tu piel, mientras te beso la boca

Quiero que se repita la ocasión 
Quiero que tú repitas tus movimientos 
Bebe que tal si paramos el tiempo 
Y bregamos con la situación

Quiero que se repita la ocasión 
Quiero que se repitan tus movimientos 
Bebe que tal si paramos el tiempo 
Y mejor tenemos sexo

Yo sé que estás consciente de lo que de ti me han dicho 
Te gustan las mujeres, pero te encanta el bicho 
Yo estoy claro de lo que de mi te han dicho 
Que lo tengo grande y que bien rico chicho

Y dale metele, solo por capricho, so metele, motivate
Agárralo con tu mano y verás que es algo sano dale para adelante y para atrás y súbete en el palo 
Ven lucete, no me hagas perder el tiempo
Dale ven que me siento contento
Este bicho parece cemento

Yo sé que a ti te gusta cuando hacemos el amor 
Y prendemos en llamas juntos en la habitación  
Ah juntos en la habitación
Oh

Quiero que se repita la ocasión 
Quiero que tú repitas tus movimientos

Ella es Lucifer, por dentro te lo voy a esconder 
Real G 4 life tatuado en mi piel, fumando puré
Chingando con 100 kilos en el hotel 
Te la voy a comer, este bicho te va poseer

Mis soldados se mueren por mi, 20 mil en mi cuello este bicho es dinero y poder
'Toy enpercosiao te lo pongo en la boca y después te lo voy a meter 
Yo tengo todas la Jordans bebe, mi pistola es una 23
Me puse la Infrared, porque todas llenas de sangre las bred 
Yo soy un demonio por dentro de tu cuerpo, tú vas a venirte otra vez 
Yo te exploto la traquea y después hacemos la cabrona 69 al revés 
A mi me quieren matar, pero ella me chinga para atrás y me quita el estrés
Por party cobraba mil, después cobre dos mil, pero ahora estoy cobrando res

Haciéndolo contigo yo me crezco 
Bien rico te lo voy entrando bien lento 
Me grita Geezy más duro y yo que soy un bellaco 
La embarro toda de crema y ese culo se lo es barato

Media taquilla de sour, fumando en La Perla y Los Towers
Tengo la vía directa, me llegan a casa los kilos de powder 
Mi jefa le dijo a su amiga que soy un chulito y que chingo bien rico 
Ahora se pasa en Snapchat mandándome fotos del culo y el crico 

Ay ma' tú dices conmigo quieres lucirte 
Hacerme cosas malas y la demonia convertirte 
Yo arriba, tú abajo yo abajo tú arriba 
Tú encima to'a la noche pa' darte calentura

DJ Luis,"Uh, it's really goin' down in the South bitch
Yeah nigga, we know hip hop and rap
And all that shit started in the motherfuckin' East

Know I'm sayin'? Then it went to the West coast
And they did it a little bit better
Know I'm sayin'? But now it's our time
To shine down here nigga

Know I'm sayin'? So since y'all niggaz keep sayin'
We ain't real hip hop down here
We don't wanna be down with you bitch ass niggaz

So y'all stay up there with that bullshit
This country rap tunes down here nigga
Young Pimp, Young Bun, Underground Kingz

All the O.G.'s that's recognizin' the real
I got love for y'all but all you bitch ass niggaz
Talkin' down in ya records, you can eat a dick
Hold up

Pushin' cocaine, servin' pounds of weed
Steady stayin' on the grind
Pussy nigga can't say he ain't hatin' me
Because if you did, then you wouldn't be lyin'

But how in the hell am I supposed to respect the man?
That talk down on every song
You steady actin' like a bitch, you steady cryin' your eyes out
Say my name pussy nigga, we can get the shit on, on, ooh yeah

Quit hatin' the South, baby
We gettin' paper in the South, gettin' money
Quit hatin' the South, baby
Quit hatin' the South

Well, it's been a long time my nigga, I shouldn't have left you
When I some real trill shit to go left to
Gotta lot of respect fool, for the ones before me
But when my time came they act like they ain't know me

I've been down with rap music since Cold Crush and Melle
Before MTV put Run-D.M.C. on the tele
Back when Whodini tried to tell ya about ya friends
Nigga I was givin' rap all my time and my ends

Bought damn near every record the motherfucker dropped
West coast gangsta music, East coast hip hop
Now it's our time to shine and the tables is turned
Them motherfuckers aggravated 'cause we gettin' some burn

There's no room for everybody, just a few niggaz is swole
Probably 'cause they favorite rappers ain't in control
But just let go of the past 'cause it's hurtin' your hands
And pass it over to the next generation of fans

And quit hatin' the South, baby
We gettin' paper in the South, getting' money
Quit hatin' the South, baby
Quit hatin' the South

I'm blastin' off on you hoes like NASA
You double standards and hypocrisy remind me of Massa
We ain't good enough to eat at ya table but when ya dick get hard
You wanna run up with [Incomprehensible]

I from the get coke but I'm still clockin' figures
Bitch hoe cock suckin' nigga
And that goes for all you visitors too
If you don't like it down here, get the fuck on fool

They say you can't rap and they questionin' our intellect
Friendly ass niggaz jumpin' bad on the Internet
Ain't nobody typin' that much can't be a danger
Catch you in person, bitch I'll break yo' fingers

It's some trash in the South but I promise you
From the East to the West, some of y'all garbage too
As long as the beat knock and the lyrics hot, son
I can give a rat's ass where a rap is from

I remember N.W.A. and PE
Had me feelin' like a rapper was the thing to be
You can't fuck with Willie D, UGK either
Disrespectin' the code, does motherfuckers neither

Quit hatin' the South, baby
We gettin' paper in the South, gettin' money

To all the radio, TV and even the press
Been hatin' on the Sizz-outh like we ain't impress
Y'all think we came in the place, say man we came in the state
Y'all shoulda listened to Andre, bitch we got somethin' to say

And all you washed up rappers, you ain't what it's about
I see y'all tryin' rap like us and puttin' grills in ya mouth
Y'all buy the beat, buy the beat like y'all bouncin' and twerkin'
But hoe we know what's goin' on and bitch that bullshit ain't workin'

I'ma O.G. Rock Ball, write my name up on the wall
Fuck yo' bitch and hit the switch and put my dick up in her jaw
I'm Sweet Jones, fucked a clone, legend on the microphone
Player's choice, silver Royce, keep yo' bitch's pussy moist

I'm bumped the school, that's how I do, sippin' drank, each teen night
In Benz, big blue lens, knock this bitch and fuck with her friend
Candy cart, squeeze 'em out, bought the ranch man fuck the house
And y'all still gotta buy y'all dope from us
So what the fuck you bitch niggaz talkin' 'bout?

All you ole sensitive ass niggaz, know I'm talkin' 'bout?
Y'all niggaz on y'all period up there bitch
Know I'm talkin' 'bout? y'all hide behind them e-mail addresses
Sendin' that bullshit through the air

Bitch, say my name bitch, I'ma come to ya house
Fuck how you feel, country rap tunes nigga
They put all y'all records on one side of the store
And put all the country rap music on the other side of the store
And see who sell out first

Bitch ass nigga, it's ya own fault ya shit ain't sellin'
You reap what you sew and fuck you in ya pussy
Keep talkin' that shit
Them young gladiators go come get you too partner

Already, UGK for life, fuck how you feel about it bitch

DJ Manian,"Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power, but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

Can you imagine when this race is won?
Turn our golden the faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music's played by the, the madman

Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever

Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever young

Some are like water, some are like the heat
Some are a melody and some are the beat
Sooner or later they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young?

It's so hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
Youth's like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever

So many adventures given up today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams swinging out of the blue
Oh let it come true

Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever, and ever?

Truth was in creating, not the aftermath

In the quietude of daybreak, we watch the sunlight bend

Wink my eye at cha bitch, now wishing now she could touch
See the J's on my feet and she love the diamond cuts
Fresh to death, everyday, like I jumped up outta caskets
Ask Chino Dolla about that dope boi magic
Connected like apartments, keep one in the cartridge
Chevy seats ostrich, name in the carpet

So don't get mad, pimp keep it cool

Roll the windows up baby, blow an ounce with me
We tight of the green and Hen
Get in the wind
Pick the chipped up flip up and call your friends
Lets do it till the police kick the doors in
Tell them niggaz get to steppin', let all the hoes in
Make room for this big body
In a big body, pimp caso, the life of a 'cardi
Brave, back as a spade
Teeth glistening, hard core, hittin'
EightBall the one they mentionin'
Hot South southern fried everybody want to taste
Erase hate, and bring love to a dark place
Show my face, and get love when I'm recognized
G and me in the 5 gettin' high
Ball has got cheese
Showin' love with the thicky
Relax your mind and baby bounce with me

Chorus
You could cheef on a leaf in a jeep with me
Break it down, make it fat, fire it up with me
But you know what I really want you to do with me
Bounce with me, baby, bounce with me
You could sex on ex in the lex with me
Lick it up, lick it down, baby, work with me
But you know what I really want you to do with me
Bounce with me, baby, bounce with me

Get on a continental jet 7:30 in the A-M
A-T-L bound tryin' to escape the mayhem
Beeper off, at the Swiss with my mistress
Kissin' me, and lickin' me, actin' like she miss this
Playground just for her to play in the hay around
Fringe benefits, make her want to stay around
Money makin' cats with gats who love hood rats
Thug players who make tracks, and bust raps
Confidentialy, we represent Tennesee
Gain control, puttin' soul in this industry
Bounce, baby, bounce
Shake the room up
Do it, keep it hyped
So we can blast off
High into the sky
Until the beat stops
But don't stop, till all the hoes clothes drop
Call big Ball Dr. Sticky, got the remedy
Throw your hands up and baby bounce with me

Chorus

Now I have been many places, seen so many things
Did what a lot of niggaz only see in they dreams
Hoes used to be like, uh, nigga you too big
Now they let me bust shots all over they wig
In the bed, on the floor, hot tub everyday
I know it be this way, cause I make a lot of pay
I smoke a lot of hay, tune up mentally
Gentally, grab a pen and kill the enemy
Dead, cause everything I said flip like work
Made a stack, bustin' raps, doin' concerts
hate to see a player doin' good, I know
Behind my back, talkin' shit like a little hoe
Little did you know, I got the people standin' up
Tucked away, in the cut, makin' platinum stuff
EightBall spittin' nothin' but poetry
Relax your ind, and baby, bounce with me

DJ Melo-Mix,"These are the tales, the freaky tales
The tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales, the freaky tales
The tales that I tell so well

I met this girl, her name was Joan
She loved the way I rocked the microphone
When I met Joan, I took her home
She was just like a doggy all on my bone
I met another girl, her name was Ann
All she wanted was to freak with a man
When I met Ann, I soaked her pans
We ended up freakin' by garbage can
The next young freak I met was Red
I took her to the house and she gave me head
She likes to freak was all she said
We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed
There's another girl, her name is Mary
Talked about sex and the girl acted scary
I heard she was freakin' for my homeboy Jerry
Took her to the house and I popped that cherry
Young and tender, sweet Denise
Get her in the bed and the girl's a beast
I tell you, homeboy, if you get a piece
She only talks about signin' a lease
I met this tender, her name was Lori
And a X-rated movie wouldn't tell her story
She had a twin sister, her name was Lisa
And just like Lori, she's a real dick pleaser
My girlfriend's name was Michelle, 
Her booty was bigger than a tale on a whale
When i freaked Michelle, I freaked her well
Her pussy got hotter than flames in hell
I G'd this girl, her name was Tammy
I didn't want to do it cause the bitch was flammy
She had a best friend, her name was Jane
I pulled to the side and I spitted that game
I met a lot of freaks in my lifespan
Freaked one night with a girl named Pam
The very next day I saw her with her man
One week passed and I was in her again
I had an old tender, her name was Janine
She was thirty-two and I was only eighteen
She likes to freak, she's just a fiend
It really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans
I want to big freak, fat and sloppy
I kick on back and I watch her mouth
Two tons of fun, big mama jama
A country-girl from Alabama
I met this girl, her name was Betty
Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death
I was tired as hell, I was drippin' sweat
But I was all up in her tryin' to hold my breath
Bake and shake us, I met this freak in Vegas
She said her name was Donna
She was a built little freak from China
I said I don't pimp or gigolo
I'm havin' so much money that I don't need a hoe
You can break yourself but you can't break me
You never met a player like $hort, baby
I knew a dick sucker named Betty-Jo
Took her to my home and we did it on the floor
The girl got freaky and I tell you more
She was down on her knees beggin' to blow
She's like another freak named Rene
You get her alone and she'll make your day
Like Burger King, she knows the play
But a freak like Rene, you can have it your way

These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well

I met this girl, thick as hell
Only sixteen, said her name was Linell
I took her to my house, I could not wait
Her shit was much tighter than Central Safe
Let me tell you this since we talkin' young
I met another girl, said her name was Yvonne
Always talkin' about havin' fun
Once again in the bed I got it goin' on
I'm Sir Too $hort, couldn't be no punk
I try to get funky like female funk
So when you see me comin' or see me goin'
I keep my money, let the hoes keep throwin'
I once met a tender, she did it for free
On the Foothill bust number forty-three
All the way on the back she was workin' me
Had my big beatbox and I was jammin' the beat
I met this freak named aunt Winell
Macked on the baby like an ice-cold vet
Everythin' she had is what I get
Cause I'm Too $hort, baby, I don't play that shit
I met another freak, her name was Rita
Baby thought that $hort just might eat her
I told her like this, she can suck my peter
Or even go home cause I  knew I didn't need her
Scratched her name off my telephone book
Never again I took a second look
Cause the next young freak, her name was Sharon
She kept lookin', well, I kept stairin'
Her booty was stuffed in the jeans she was wearin'
She never left, she cutted out
I know you all know what I'm talkin' about
There's a freak named Shannon, such a sinner
She smokes that pipe and she's gettin' thinner
Shannon is cool but her mind is gone
One fat rock and it's goin' on
She had another buddy, came by my place
Thick ass bitch, said her name was Grace
She walked in the door wearin' a lace
You shoulda seen that look that was on my face
She's like this tender named Belinda
Homeboys call her Belinda the Blender
She gave head like she made it up
She was twenty years old with a big round butt
Had a girl slick like olive oil
Her father was rich and the girl was spoiled
When she got mad he blood would boil
But I rapped her all up like aluminum foil

These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well

Shockedy life, Friday night, it's goin' on Too $hort
Three weeks ago I met this freak
She followed me around like Mary's sheep
I hitted around the corner and when she came
I grabbed her by the arm and I asked her name
She said it was Anita and her man's in Santa Rita
I took her to my home and homeboy, I geed her
Set her on the way the very next way
Playboy $hort was ready to play
I bumped to this girl, her name was Roseann
We hitted the motel and got it goin' on
Holiday Inn to the break of dawn
When I took baby home, I freaked her mom
I knew this tender named Sherrie
I took her to the house and let her freak on me
Baby was a fan, she loved my beat
But I wouldn't raise my leg to let her kiss my feet
I met this freak named Yolanda
Rolled baby doll like a brand new Honda
I was on top and she was up under
The bed hitted the wall and it sounded like thunder
I once had a date with girl named Kitty
She was so fine with big fat tiddies
All night long she was actin' shitty
So i macked on baby like I was Frank Nitti
There's another girl, her name is Rose
I use to roll baby like brand new Volv's
I never saw Rose wearin' clothes
She's a pimp house pet, ready to pose
I was ridin' down the street when I met Janet
Her booty was bigger than the whole damn planet
Ass everywhere, I just can't stand it
Tried to poem it but I could not manage
I had this freak, her name was Bunny
Said I was the only man who ever called her honey
Everythin' I did to her was funny
I macked on bunny and I took her money
Eight tonight a date with Shirlie
She was really short and her hair was curly
If you saw baby you liked this girlie
She was so fine I went to get her early
Shirlie was freakin' like a girl named Rachel
Her bite was vicious and it sure was fatal
She liked to kiss all on my navel
Those are her lips on top of my label
I knew another freak, her name was Candy
Real big lips and they came in handy
I smooth got worked and it was so dandy
I hooked the brood up with my homeboy Randy
He did me a favor in return
Gave me a lizard, said her name was Laverne
Baby got tossed and I got it on
I grabbed the microphone and started to sing my song
My young homeboy heard me rap
And said he had way more freaks than that
So I told him like this, they might be freakin'
But, boy, you never had that T-P-Treatment",Freaky Tales (Beat)

We can't stop now bitch!!!
We can't stop,
And you can't stop us,
So bitch don't try.
We tru soldiers, we don't die,
We don't die, we don't die. 
We don't die, we don't die.

I'm bout my paper, my paper,
Important people on my pager.
I might not drink Alize,
But I'll smoke you under the table.
Don't make me peel your potato,
Don't make the devil your neighbor.
I might not be nothing to you,
But I'm the shit on this label!
Five hundred words might make it hard to digest what I say,
But five up in the morning, see me on the billboards
Y'all gonna keep it that way.
Hold on as tight as you can,
Whatever you do, don't loosen your grip,
Not only are they anticipating your every move
They're waiting for you to slip!!!
But like I told you before, we not gonna fall, put a banana in the tailpipe,
I'm not bout livin' in no six by six, wearing no muthafuckin' jail stripes.
Been bout it from the start nigga, we raw nigga,
You don't want to, go to, war nigga.
We superstar niggas,
You know who we are niggas.
From poverty in the projects,
To livin' large niggas.
It take one hell of a combination, to get what we got,
We soldiers on a mission, and you can't stop us!!!

[Chorus]

Nigga want to start shit,
That they know they can't finish.
By far niggas want to go to war,
But they know when they ain't winning.
Fixin' to keep this bitch jumpin, like a muthafuckin', second line,
Been bout it, and I'll be rowdy, and you gonna know it by my, second rhyme.
No limit chain around my neck, so check, and respect the sign,
Y'all want to play, but I guarantee that you won't play, a second time.
Sometime I'm in camoflauge and sometime I'm in all black,
Y'all want to go to war with us, wit you knowin' we all strapped!!!
Fuck it, pop it, don't stop it, 'cause I drop, by no means, look,
Bitches dyin' like a dope fiend, while he have on a pair of old jeans.
Nigga what?  pistols we all got, sometimes it's all glocks,
Keep one in the chamber for danger and make sure they all cocked.
Went from a, small knot to a tall knot,
Nigga please, I got all the g's for breakin' these ki's down to all rocks.
Blow up the spot till it's all hot, surround the world together 'cause y'all not,
Nigga we ain't gon stop jus 'cause y'all stop then it's our props.

But if you want to get started, get started, let's do it tonight!!!

[Chorus: x2]",It Ain't My Fault (Beat)
DJ Melo-Mix,"Now here's a little story - I've got to tell
About three bad brothers - you know so well
It started way back in history
With Adrock, M.C.A., and me - Mike D.
I had a little horse named Paul Revere
Just me and my horsy and a quart of beer
Riding across the land - kicking up sand
Sheriff's posse on my tail cause I'm in demand
One lonely Beastie I be
All by myself - without nobody
The sun is beating down on my baseball hat
The air is gettin' hot - the beer is getting flat
Lookin' for a girl - I ran into a guy
His name is M.C.A., I said, ""Howdy"" - he said, ""Hi""

He told a little story - that sounded well rehearsed
Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst
The brew was in my hand - and he was on my tip
His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry - he asked me for a sip
He said, ""Can I get some?""
I said, ""You can't get none!""
Had a chance to run
He pulled out his shotgun
He was quick on the draw - I thought I'd be dead
He put the gun to my head and this is what he said,

""Now my name is M.C.A. - I've got a license to kill
I think you know what time it is - it's time to get ill
Now what do we have here - an outlaw and his beer
I run this land, you understand - I make myself clear.""
We stepped into the wind - he had a gun, I had a grin
You think this story's over but it's ready to begin

""Now I got the gun - you got the brew
You got two choices of what you can do
It's not a tough decision as you can see
I can blow you away or you can ride with me"" I said, I'll ride with you if 
You can get me to the border
The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter
I did it like this - I did it like that
I did it with a whiffleball bat
So I'm on the run - the cop's got my gun
And right about now - it's time to have some fun
The King Adrock - that is my name
And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne.""
We rode for six hours the we hit the spot
The beat was a bumping and the girlies was hot
This dude was staring like he knows who we are
We took the empty spot next to him at the bar
M.C.A. said, ""Yo, you know this kid?""
I said, ""I didn't."" - but I know he did
The kid said, ""Get ready cause this ain't funny
My name's Mike D. and I'm about to get money.""
Pulled out the jammy - aimed it at the sky
He yelled, ""Stick 'em up!"" - and let two fly
Hands went up and people hit the floor
He wasted two kids that ran for the door
""I'm Mike D. and I get respect
Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect""
M.C.A. was with it and he's my ace
So I grabbed the piano player and I punched him in the face
The piano player's out - the music stopped
His boy had beef - and he got dropped
Mike D. grabbed the money - M.C.A. snatched the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold.",Paul Revere (Beat)

I figured you would, now leave me alone
You pick and you wish on a four-leaf clover
To be the E double E over and over
You're intrigued by the way I do my thing
(Do what?) Pick up the mic high and make it swing

[PMD]
I have the capability to rap and chill
Cold wax and tax MC's who tend to act ill
It's like a Diggum Smack
Smack me and I'll smack you back
I get goosebumps when the baseline thumps
A sucker MC arrives, now it's time for lunch
When I'm cooling on the scene, I notice one thing
I'm not Bounce, so sucker MC's cling
I consider myself better than average
Yo, I rock the mic like a wild beast savage

[Erick Sermon]
I'm in the bottling state, I can't concentrate
I make a move like chess, and then I yell ""checkmate""
You know why I get zanier and zanier?
Because of EPMD mania
When I walk through the crowd I can see heads turning
I hear voices saying ""That's Erick Sermon""
Not only from the women, but from the men
You know what? It feels good, my friend

I'm the P double E, the Thrilla of Manilla
Better known as the MC cold killer

If J spin it, then it has to be fresh
To make you dance until there's no one left

Praying like a prey when the fox in action
I smell blood, no time for maxing
Camouflage in the green, my back is arc
Plus you in trouble cause it's after dark
My eyes close like Steve Austin, I got you in the square
I won't let you run, nah, that ain't fair
So I clear my visions until I can spot him
Snatch him by the neck and say ""Hmmm I got him""

[PMD]
Whenever MC's, you're in over your head
My rhymes are hungry plus they haven't been fed
The process of elimination is quite simple
Let you grow like a blackhead and pop you like a pimple
Slice you like lettuce, toss you like a salad
Revoke your MC license if your rhymes ain't valid
As we go on, sucker MC's sound wacker
Like a parrot says ""Polly want a cracker""

It was a record test, nothing we can't handle
At the house they had the mics on the mantle
Looked at the DJ and said ""May I?""
Lit it up like the Fourth of July
Because I float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Whoa, I'm the E of EPMD
I have a strong point of view on the way things run
Just shut up and listen and learn my son

[PMD]
Absorb that ass like Bounty, the quicker picker upper
To tell you up front, you're nothing but a sucker
The style we're using, no doubt copastetic
You try to bite and yet sound pathetic
Design my rhymes like a taylor, floatin' like a sailor
As the P gets stronger, MC's get staler
Not bragging or protagging, surely not fagging
MC's surrender, raise the flags and
Give up the titles because the signs are vital
I keep a voice tuned at a slow and swift idle

You a customer

I need a man meal sandwich, yes I need Manwich
I feel good, now it's time to do damage
I feel like balanced, you know what I mean?
Wanna rhyme one time, to release the steam
When I grab the mic I get dramatic like an actor
You know why I get over? I'm the master
I do a show, pack it in til it's clamming up
Look for the microphone then jam it up

You said you see me jamming in New York Tech
You got one right fella, you deserve a check
How did you know, you must have been jocking
How do you know the places I be rocking?
Don't follow me fella, every move that I make
I'm hostile now so I'll give you a break
Well search upon me but don't go past the limit
Here's a card and on the back is my fan club digits

There's two things to check out in the words that I'm saying
Plus listen to the good time playing

Fire rhyme after rhyme, watch MC's duck and

Is a word we use everyday
Most the time we use it in the wrong way
Now you can look the word up, again and again
But the dictionary doesn't know the meaning of friends

And if you ask me, you know, I couldnt be much help
Because A friend is somebody you judge for yourself
Some are ok, and they treat you real cool
But some mistake kindness for bein a fool

We like to be with some, because they're funny
Others come around when they need some money
Some you grew up with, around the way
And you're still real close too this very day

Homeboys through the Summer, Winter, Spring and Fall
And then there's some we wish we never knew at all
And this list goes on, again and again
But these are the people that we call friends
 
When we first went out together, we barely knew each other
We had no intentions, on becoming lovers
But in no time at all, you became my girl
Me and you, one on one, against the world
Talkin on the telephone for hours at a time
Or else I was at your house, or you was at mine
Then came the arguements and all kinds of problems
Besides making love, we had nothing in common
It couldnt last long because it started out strong
But I guess we went about the whole thing wrong
Cause out of nowhere it just came to an end
Because we became lovers before we were friends

You say you and your girlfriend were so tight
You took her out with you and your guy one night
She even had a set of keys to your home
And you shared mostly everything you owned

But as she shook your hand, she stole your man
And it was done so swift, it had to be a plan
Couldn't trust her with cheese, let alone your keys
With friends like that you don't need enemies
 
You wonder how long it was all going on
And your still not sure if your man is gone
You say, well if she took him he was never mine
But deep inside you know that's just another lie

And now you're kinda cold to the people you meet
Cause of something that was done to you by some creep
But nevertheless, I'll say it again
That these are the people that we call friends

Criando y cuidando de mi, madre mía
Con estas palabras quiero demostrarte
Todo lo que siento y también explicarte
Que entiendo las veces que conmigo te enojaste
Que entiendo las veces que me regañaste
Ahora se que lo hacías por el bien mio
Madre nunca me dejaste pasar hambre ni frio
Porque tu calor de madre siempre ha estado ahí para mi
Y no creas viejo mio que me olvido de ti
De tus esfuerzos de darme siempre lo mejor
De darme fuerza cuando he estado de lo peor
Perdóname madre si te hice llorar
Perdóname las veces que te hice rabiar
No hay mujer en este mundo que ocupe tu lugar
Porque madre hay una sola y no se puede remplazar

Tanto que has hecho por mi
Cuando niño no comprendí
Tras los años que has sufrido
Pero sin embargo he tenido tu calor

Siempre humilde, de buen corazon
Y siempre como madre tenias la razón
Quisiera darte el mundo madre si pudiera
Y todo lo que hay en el del resto fuera
Porque lo que único que importa para mi
Eres tu y que mis hijos y familia
Estén bien de salud
Recuerdo cuando me enfermaba y estaba muy mal
Corrías de inmediato conmigo al hospital
Tu nunca dejaste que algo me pasara
Y si algo había que hacer lo hacías por la cara
Ahora deja darte un abrazo y un beso
Porque te quiero con toda mi alma y por eso
Perdóname madre si te hice llorar
Perdóname las veces que te hice rabiar
No hay mujer en este mundo que ocupe tu lugar
Porque madre hay una sola y no se puede remplazar

Tanto que has hecho por mi
Cuando niño no comprendí
Tras los años que has sufrido
Pero sin embargo he tenido tu calor

No había limite en las cosas que tu hacías
Por mi y mis hermanos tras las noches y los días
Como lo hiciste madre dime
Todo el sacrificio con tres hijos vuelta en Chile
No hay forma en este mundo como te pueda pagar
Tanto drama hasta los años que tuviste que pasar
Enfrentando diferentes situaciones
Madre como tu hay una en millones
Soy realista y se que algún día te me vas al cielo
Ojalas sea yo el primero
Madre verte bajo tierra no lo quiero ni pensar
Tranquila madre mía el cielo puede esperar
Fuiste tu la que me dio la vida
Con mucho amor
En cambio yo te di preocupaciones y dolor
Cree madre nunca fue la intención de herirte
Por eso escucha lo que tengo que decirte
Perdóname madre si te hice llorar
Perdóname las veces que te hice rabiar
No hay mujer en este mundo que ocupe tu lugar
Porque madre hay una sola y no se puede remplazar

Tanto que has hecho por mi
Cuando niño no comprendí
Tras los años que has sufrido
Pero sin embargo he tenido tu calor",Madre Mia

That the world was made up of
This brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

When I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out
What's in my head
And I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
What's going on?
And I say, hey hey hey hey
I said hey, what's going on?

Ooh, ooh ooh

I try all the time, in this institution
And I pray, oh my god do I pray

Look up at da stars, she like ""Honey where da roof?""
Pull up in a Dawes ?, canaries ? dey go on roof,
Even once had a job pourin tar up on da roof.
Dat boy had it hard, no fasad it's da truth,
So now when I menage and get massaged it's da proof.
Proof's in da pudding and dat bakin soda taken,
Paper dat I'm makin, gotta take dem photos naked.
Listenin to niggas like whistlin dat Wendy Williams,
I flip my middle finga, I'm chillin on twenty million.
Da rumors turn me on I'm masterbatin at da top,
These hoes so excited so dey catchin every drop.
I'm dodgin debacles like pot holes in Jamaica,
We cut down the weed, bury the paper on dem acres.
Martin had a dream, Bob got high,
I still do both but somehow I got by.

Creflo prayed, Mike Vick payed,
Bobby Brown strayed, Whitney lost weight.
Kimbo Slice on da pad when I write,
Dat may why the money lookin funny in the light.
But who really cares? You just throw it in the air,
Celebratin wealth, pourin Mo«t in her hair-
Excuse me, her weeve- the bluest of weed,
Trunk full of white, car smell like bleu cheese.
Dat boy get salad ?, beef bout movements,
BM dubs on dem big thangs lookin foolish.
Shawty sittin low, big thangs poppin,
Tip on da glock from a trip up in Compton.
Shootin at da cops- fuck one time.
I gave her to da block, I fucked one time.

Suppress ya appetite, we takin ya lil' tray.
Love my handgun but my choppa still da shit,
Banned in 1994 but I'm too legit to quit.
1996, kilos was the shit,
But dat were better den roofin dat shit be bad for ya skin.
Niggas was ruthless, lord knows dat I sinned,
But I thought about my future and the loops I could pin.
Walked out on a gig and I turned to da streets,
Kept my name low key, I ain't heard from in weeks.
I came up with a strategy to come up mathematically,
I did it for da city but now everybody mad at me.
Mothafuck em all, they sweat from my balls,
If I drop anotha album I did dat fo my dawgs.
10 Maybachs, everybody ridin big,
I just sit back like: Look what I did.
Den I bow my head and beg for forgiveness,
Once I said my prayer, everybody back to business.

Smokin on a blunt in my own restaurant,
People lookin from a distance think I'm Big Daddy Kunk,
Reincarnated, spirit of a G.
Beef? I'll make you dinner, take a seat so we could eat.
A Farrakhan aura, paws on the Port,
You eat from da bowl while ya dog need a fork.
Niggas ain't loyal, snakes slithered in dey coil,
I'm laughin at you 'cause, kill you niggas when I'm bored.

We steppin on ya crew til the mothafuckas crushed,
And makin sweet love to every women dat ya lust.
I love to pay her bills, can't wait to pay her rent,
Curtis Jackson baby mama ain't askin for a cent.
Burn the house down, we gotta buy another,
Don't forget the gas can, jealous, stupid muthafucka.
To anotha chapter, paper dat I captured,
Caught up in da rapture of gunshots and laughter.
Homicide is human and nigga you lookin funny,
Women love to stare cause dey know dey see da money.
I open up a mind by openin bank accounts,
Deposit a 100 stacks, break up or take it out.
Baby dats a gift, maybe you could live,
I knew it wouldn't work, but I just like to give.
Used to run da street- young nigga, bare feet,
Now I'm in da suites and I'm eatin crab meats.
Ice so right, otha rappers envy,
Dey callin all my jewelers up askin wat he spendin.
Thinkin bout Boss, not thinkin bout dem,

Young Renzel, let's get it
Look me in my eyes and tell me what you see
You watch the homie come up from a mustard seed
Ain't looking for no problems, just a chance to eat
And I make mama a promise I'm gon' plant my feet
Had some trouble on the campus for the skills I lack
But I double all the profits and I'm quick to stack
Only thing hung in the trapper was a triller plaque
Two tone double lard tucked in the back scene on the beach
Supremes on my feet

DJ Ötzi,"I got my first real six-string
Bought it at the five-and-dime
Played it till my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit, Jody got married
Shoulda known, we'd never get far

Oh when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always want to be there
Those were the best days of my life

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Oh yeah
Back in the summer of '69
Ohhh

Man we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever, forever, no

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six-string
Think about you wonder what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me it would last forever
Oh and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never

du warst immer für mich da,
weil du zu mir gehörst,
auch wenn's nach unten ging,
konnte ich auf dich zählen.
Und wenn mein Weg mich ganz nach oben,
auf den Gipfel führt,
dann wärst du für immer,
an meiner Seite
niemals fehlen.

Nur mit dir allein,
will ich auf Wolken tanzen gehen.
Mit dir allein,

Nur mit dir allein.
will ich jeden Morgen

durch alle Zeiten gehen!

Wenn ich atemlos
und ohne Ziel nach Liebe such
wenn ich lachen will
und wenn ich träum' von Glück
und wenn ich einfach nur
jemanden zum reden brauch
ja dann wünsch' ich mich
nur zu dir allein zurück!

Als ich dich sah, ja sofort wusste ich
Du bist das einzige Mädchen für mich
In unserem Ort, auf dieser Welt
Der einzige Ort untern den Sternenzelt
Die Eltern sie sagten, ihr seid noch zu jung
Doch ich hatte mein Herz für immer verloren
Dann öffnet das Glück, dir einmal die Tür
Dann gehst du hindurch und dann stirbst du dafür

Mit seiner rechten Hand erschuf er dein Gesicht
Gott hatte einen Traum von einem Weizenfeld
Es ist das blonde Haar, das dir auf die Schultern fällt

Fresh out my khaki fatigues
All you B.G.'s, you little leagues
??? run deep down in my genetic code, my DNA, frequent
Travellin, goin in and out, a juvenile delinquent
Meat-colored so you know I got a heart
Automatically, but I made it far
In the game, fame, fortune, get an abortion
You niggas want beef, I feed it to you raw in tiny, small portions
The lyrical composition has been composed by and written
Spitten, created for the part of use only if it's hard-hittin
West Coast section comin through droppin bombs from all directions
Primary candidate assassinated at the '96 elections
I told you before, the war, settle the score
With heavy metal, the rebel
Takin off like the Space Shuttle
Makin MC's smash on the gas pedal
Maintain, hold it down, claim the victory over the golden crown
Crowd around and history explains the names 
of those that fell off the sound
Overload the circummode, malfunction in the mic's membrane
Radioactivity cause electricity in the cloud to make it rain
And have you wet, dripping, flipping, slipping

[ VERSE 2: Threat ]
I prefer to take trips, circle the atmosphere and make chips
Then sit back, gangbang on you niggas with major clips
Championships mostly, put Hennessy to my lips costly
As we announce the new grand prize winners, 
Zoo Tribe finna take the trophy
Wreck shit give me migrane, stop, pause, I need Tylenol, Codeine
Extra-strength kill the pain quick ??? light it all in a flame
Let it burn, let that be a lesson learned, turn
Back toward the ghetto, 
had to blast past the last level to get respect earned
I received my diploma for bein no joke, no baloner
Just to let you know when you walk upon a professional microphoner
Rap creature, the Zoo keepers execute the beats featured
Transmittin signals through your stereo, thumpin through your speakers
I have to force the toys, not the boys
Makin all that irritatin noise
Your forbidden styles ain't allowed 
Drop the mic, nigga, watch out
Tell them suckers they gotta bail, no entourage personnel
Goes beyond this point, funky joint, toxic, chemical smells
Modern-day technology cuts like biology
Retire you and your co-workers, nothin personal, just company policy

[ CHORUS ]
[ VERSE 3: Threat ]
Trace you like when the feds be lookin for ya
Cause groups to catch paranoia
You can hear a 100 footsteps mobbin, that's the Zoo Tribe warriors
Shoot ya with a rhyme from the past and sendin it to the future
When I wreck to play Rock Steady, you can barely beat the computer
Circle like the drive-through, pull up your automobile and park
Excuse me, ma'am, 
would you like to purchase some fresh produce we call the bomb?
Sick shiznit, fertilize the beat, get it pregnant
But that's another episode of another whole entirely different segment
I'm zooin, crocodiles bite my styles chewin

DJ Pooh,"I got an idea... 

I had a plan to grow indo' 
Therefore the outdo' was to be recreated, duplicated in a grow room 
Wanted to produce the kinda plant that you could display up in a showroom 
So beautiful, but yet stinky 
Stick to your thumb, index, middle, ring, pinky 
And the brain 
First thing was to provide setting for proper cultivation 
Discrete location 
Ten by ten foot spot 
Lit up by a thousand watt lamp, plus two air-vents for the air to circulate 
And ehm - I calculate 
30 gallons of water a week, I'm really into this 
Now all I need is some good fertilizer and some photosynthesis 
To proceed, after I choose the right seeds to fall in motion 
With a little love and devotion 
I can make the front cover of High Times 
I hope I never get busted and have to pay some fines 
For havin' a, secret garden, like Barry White 
I must not tell anyone and keep my lips sealed tight 
I got the grow room 

If you ain't never had the homegrown that made you choke 
Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope 
And if you're high already and can't take another toke 
Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope 

During the first stage of growth the seeds germinate slow 
Start a root system, sprout up some leaves, and grow 
Towards the light 
Make sure the temperature's right 
I was told by this one guy 
Watch your plants closely, beware of bugs and fungi 
They'll hurt your garden, they'll only interfere 
With the vegetative growth that lasts about two months to a year 
When full grown flowers bloom big buds and leaves 
Watch out for thieves 
People like to stash shit up their sleeves 
It's not been three months 
I'm tempted to break off a piece and roll some blunts 
I wonder what it is, is this some Skunk? 
I see some purple stems and orange hairs 
Could it be the Humble mixed with Maui? It's a hybrid 
Wow! Look what I did 
I got the green thumb 
Observe the superb herb 
Bushy branches, loud smell 
Like green pastel 
I got it on deck for all seasons 
And if anyone asks, it's for medical reasons 
I got the grow room

If you ain't never had the homegrown that made you choke 
Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope 
And if you're high already and can't take another toke 
Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope 

It's been over four months, time to get high 
Uproot the plants and let them hang dry 
In a cool room with dry air, for 2 to 3 weeks 
And I'ma be waitin' right here with my loose leaf sheets 
The lovely harvest, it came in different amounts 
Four trees, each one just a few grams short of an ounce 
I can't wait to smoke it, I know it's the bomb 
Been waiting so long, make me want to write a song 
I guess I'll sell 2 ounces and puff on the rest 
Find a recipe to sprinkle herb on my fillet of chicken breast 
Or some tea shot full of THC 
Hit the bomb, cut open the swisher sweet 
Then come off on weed 
Plant stuck to my fingertips as I try to break it down 
And when lit, the fruity herby taste is profound 
It have me buzzin' for a light year, and you best believe I'll have some seeds 
And be at it again, yes indeed 
I got the grow room 

If you ain't never had the homegrown that made you choke 
Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope 
And if you're high already and can't take another toke 
Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope",Grow Room

Cause when it comes to biting, I don't condone it 

Besides, you couldn't manage my style if you owned it 

I got gruesome rhymes in my mind 

And they'll jump on a beat 

Infect it when the rhyme is injected 

Metaphors are connected 

Booty lyrics are deflected 

And the mic is intercepted 

Cause I never ever leave it neglected 

I'm tryina hold my position 

What kind of man would I be if my rhymes weren't in mint condition 

They say ""(Hey) Grimm's nowhere to be found"" 

But they catch me on camera beatin MC's down 

Always tryin to ponder what I'm pondering

I like my shit loud enough to where it blows your headphones

Assassination other crews, posses, and clicks 

The main thing's to get down and say my peace 

Whoever disrespects, I'm Rushen like Patrice 

I'll never cease with the funky, funky vocals and beats 

Cause we need more rappers around flauntin new styles and speaks 

I know we're amped to get the money, cause we need it

Who says life is fair cause ain't no justice out here nowhere
I prepare myself to hold court right here in the street
Don't come at me with no b.s., homie, give me five feet
I can't get no sleep, peace and quiet or rest
I got ulcers, migraines and pains in my chest
So God bless my soul, I feel old when I'm not
But physically and mentally I'm going through a lot
I know my time on this big blue baloon is short
Stress and pray everyday while people playin sport
Worry myself sick, so I be tryin to stay active

Havin patience is a mutha

DJ Pooh,"No worse scared can't get away 
Dumpin' with them funky rhymes 
""Pullin' out niggas frontin' like snobs"" 
Nowhere 2 hide 

I deliver to you the new blueprints 
Vocal instruments phat like them Goodyear blimps 
We pimps 
Beats 
Put 'em in the streets 
Twenty four hours seven days a week 
I kick science  but they still haven't learned 
Step beyond the point of no return get wet 
The rhythmic, hypnotic ear narcotics 
Strictly for fanatics and the gangbang addicts 
Uh, around the globe follow ya nose 
Down with the underground from my head to my toes 
Ride the groove like a three day cruise 
Peace to the east but the west coast rules 
The chocolate child unleashed out the wild 
Break the Richter scale and make the party shake tails 
Baddest on the atlas just tryin' to stay down 
You gotta get up I get off or get clowned 

I came across a close shave runnin' with them renegades 
All on display on K-T-L-A 
I hate to do it but I'm stupid don't test me 
Unless ya want to get your new clothes all messy 
We fed 'em loot but they still insist to spit words 
But they can't fuck with this they get swerved 
Graduated old school G degree 
Calm down the savage in any MC 
North, south, east, west 
But simply hittin' 'em with the melody I possess 
So raise your hands up high and get all the way with it 
It's the joint, bodies get the munches when they hit it 
Like that 
Yep bigger fatter than the piece 
Inflation went up and make the killin' increase 
So long for the plan you was plottin' 
Cause it's long and forgotten once your style turned rotten 

It's the mad maestro and it ain't no other 
Turn milk into honey and make bread off butter 
I hold the title in the middle of my palm 
For makin' freaks dance on the floor till dawn 
Make way let me show you how it's done 
It's a party and the playerhatin' niggas can't come 
Got rhymes on my pad and they all hit rock 
Don't sleep cause the sheep just might be a fox 
On a hunt 
Hot on the trail 
Hoe givin' up the drawers cause a nigga in jail 
On the bottom of the ocean to the top of the hill 
MC can't deal with my hi-tech skills 
They tight tight last all night 
Buckle up for safety and prepare to take flight 
Destination on to the next plateau

Cookies and these rookies still can't see us 
A lot of people want to be us cause we's the O.G.'s

Some can't handle it, and others just numb to it

Ask yours daughters and sons what they learning in school 
And watch them look at you like you a fool

How to do a tatoo, use a rubber, cuss, fight, and write graffiti

By letting the five Percent teach them, it's like they rather burn 

And for niggas just to turn they life around and chill 
It's harder to save, than it is to kill 
As we spill each other blood in the streets 
I see yellow tape and wonder who that is up under the sheet

Now what's the chances that they not black and not brown?

DJ Quik,"[ verse 1 ]
Pass me the... (8 ball) so I can get fucked up
My name is dj quik, so yo, what's up?
Cause I'm the baddest, I feel, gettin ill for real
With a forty of o.e., yo, you know the deal
I'm just chillin with a forty in hand
I'm so damn bent, that I can hardly stand
The bottle's in my face, and my lips are all around it
So stand to the side and watch me (down it)
Take it to the head without feeling no guilt
If I was you, I wouldn't fuck with me when I'm on tilt
Cause I'm a funky dope brother who just won't stop
And I like to drink the 8, cause it's good till the last drop
If I can't get it, then I get the discouraged
I gotta get a bottle of that liquid courage
I take a big gulp, and my head starts zoomin
But I'm feeling good as hell, so let the bass keep boomin
I'm dj quik, and the shots I'm callin
But the posse don't mind, cause we all 8-ballin

(8 ball)
(here we go)
(ah yeah)
(take it in a bottle, 40 quart or can)
Gimme the
(8 ball)
(here we go)
(ah yeah)
(drink it like a madman, yes I do)
Pass me the
(8 ball)
(here we go)
(ah yeah)
(40 ounce in my lap, and it's freezin my balls)
(8 ball)
(here we go)
(that vodka I was drinkin said, ""dude, go 'head"")

[ verse 2 ]
Now a forty only cost about $1.95
So we finna mob 17 to the liquor store
And get a case, fuck a six-pack, what's that?
I don't drink no st. ides, so forget that
Now one nigga said that bull got pull
Just drink a quart of o.e. and your ass'll be full
And if you don't think o.e. be workin
Then fuck it, bust the irkin and jerkin
Cause I'm a muthafucka that think when I wanna drink
And how can I tell that you're drunk? cause your breath stink
I know you know you need some double-mint
And you can't mack to a bitch when you're too bent
So take it from me, the homie dj quik
You better rush your cooler, cause you might be sick
Cause the 8 is for the true niggas, and the grown-ups
But that don't matter, cause quik got it sowed up
And punk muthafuckas wanna squab and all that
But we can get em up as soon as you pass the...
(8 ball)

(8 ball)
(here we go)
(ah yeah)
(take it in a bottle, 40 quart or can)
Gimme the
(8 ball)
(here we go)
(ah yeah)
(bottle was empty, so we went to the store)
Pass me the
(8 ball)
(here we go)
(ah yeah)
(40 ounce in my lap, and it's freezin my balls)

(that vodka I was drinkin said, ""dude, go 'head"")
(here's a little somethin bout a nigga like me)
(fuck it up, y'all)
(and here comes the...)
(8 ball rollin)
(it'll have you trippin)
(party)
(cause I was drunk)
(ah yeah)

Right about now I'm wonderin who else gone off that 8 ball besides myself
You know all the homies goin off of it
And I know
The l.a. posse's goin off of that (8 ball)
And g wayne goin off of that (8 ball)
And donzelli goin off of that (8 ball)
My homie shot is goin off of that (8 ball)
And playa hamm goin off of that (8 ball)
And shabby blue goin off of that (8 ball)
And mike p goin off of that (8 ball)
And n.o.e. is goin off of that (8 ball)
And little shawn goin off of that (8 ball)
And big duck goin off of that (8 ball)
My nigga stinkin off of that (8 ball)
And lou balls goin off of that (8 ball)

DJ Quik,"Now in my lyrics I kick this shit that the critics debate to
But I still create the shit that the brothers relate to
'Cause it's simple, but I'm no simp, I'm lettin you have it
To the temple leavin a scar MUCH bigger than a, pimple
You want the rubber from a gangsta boot to your grill?
Come take a ride with me and witness the thrill
Of an ass-whuppin, issued by the brothers in the khaki pants
Some think I'm too light to fight, so then they'll win but I grin
When I sail to your motherfuckin chin (MMM)
So suckers keep walkin until the po-po is talkin
In plain simple Englishno wait in plain simple slang, no jivin

Fuckin with me is more lethal than drinkin and drivin
Or try to figure the flow I deliver
Punk it makes you shiver when you think I'm takin two to your liver
The D-to-the-E-to-the-motherfuckin-A with a vengeance
A side of Quik that you ain't never experiencin
I'm stutter steppin with crap on the low and I flow well
Intensifyin with every line, cause I show and tell
My backup is backin, never leavin me lackin
With Double or Nothin, KK, D, and AMG and we're stackin
Up sales for motherfuckers just like you
(For a punk motherfucker with a punk motherfuckin crew!)
Yo I know you peeped that you just can't creep
It's too steep so take a leap because we roll too motherfuckin deep

""(How deep?) Deeper than Atlantis""
""Niggaz can deal with that shit""
So I'm rollin DEEP deep
""Deeper than Atlantis""
""Man that's bad "" "" naw that's good!""

You see we rollin deep, cause a nigga playin the backseat
We won't get beat, so run up and get sweeped
By a young motherfuckin ass nut
We whup your ass and make your momma feel it
And watch you just fold up
It's Tha D in the back with the strap
Down for some shit with a bitch in my lap
Punk motherfuckers like to play the brave role
But I don't give a fuck, you can still get T-rolled
It ain't like you never been checked befo'
You stupid nigga, your bitch, your hoe
The motherfuckers rollin the back streets
Not givin a fuck, because we roll too motherfuckin deep

""(How deep?)""

Deeper than the crack in your momma's cock
Too deep for a nigga, now I can't stop
'Cause niggaz'll roll deep, deep in the middle of the street
So deep we roll onto next week
Two's and fo's, that nigga K throws heavy blows
Heavy enough to knock the snot out of niggaz nose
'Cause niggaz ain't nothin but head and shoulders
Nigga, we should be rollin this
And I'm a roll, cause I'm doin my own thing
(Yeah, motherfuck a posse, we roll with a gang, niggaz)
For those who wanna sleep, time to creep
Straight up fools, cause niggaz is rollin deep

""(How deep?) Deeper than Atlantis""
""Niggaz can deal with that shit""
So I'm rollin DEEP deep
""Deeper than Atlantis""
""Man that's bad "" "" naw that's good!""

Fuck a one-time jack, I eenie meenie miney wet the hoes
Back in the alley I be rollin on the pimpin mode
Unfadeable, cause I'm D-double-E-P
AMG be catchin niggaz slippin constantly
And hoes wanna hoe, with a nigga-role like so
And after I trick, yo see you later bitch
And niggaz think they know what they talkin bout, whatchu sayin?
It was your bitch, that I was fuckin layin and playin
So, if she was fine don't be denyin that I did her
Trust your data nigga, and let my dick get with her
Because another motherfuckin gangster's strollin yo
In the 9-0, nigga-role, this is how I'm rollin

Yo, you must be bullshitting right?
Hell naw man, look, check this out.

Out in front of my house the other day on his jock, 
And that nigga was scared to come at her, man.
Yo man, that don't even sound like AMG, man quit bullshitting.
Man, that nigga be perpin' like he a pimp and shit, you know what I'm saying 
But if she would've stepped to me, it would have been a little different.
Man, how you figure it would've been different.

But tell me (yeah right) how would you come?

I would have came at her something like this

[DJ Quik]
Yo, how would you like to spend sometime with DJ Quik, girl?
I know I'm better than good cause I rock your world
So come with me and you will see just what I'm all about
And I go straight to the moves so let me bust it out
I want to grind and moan while I hold your hand
And girl we're both mature enough so we can dirty dance
Cause can't you see that I'm a player and I got to have it
Just like a rabbit, so see'mon baby let me grab it
I won't mislead you, just let me feed you

But you know-you know I do it right my name ain't Sydnie
Get on your hands and knees and let me stab yo kidney
From the back
All over the intestinal track
Some call it butts but I call it the butt
And now you see that I'm a true, and girl you're so appealing
I want to fuck you to the ceiling cause I got that feeling
Now that's how I come at her you know what I'm saying?

Man, I see you got a little mack daddy you know?
A little mack? Nigga I got game, these bitches be on it

Yo, I'm DJ Quik a player and a hustler too
So many girlies on my jock that I don't know what to do
I buy my jimmies by the cases and not by the packs
Because I knock so many boots I have to keep ?em in stacks
Now the fellas they get jealous, the ladies they get hot
Because they now that I'm player giving you all that I got
And in the sheets I'm a super lover that's what I said
I maybe Quik on the tables but I'm forever in bed
Because I grind it, and get behind it
And when my tape stops I get up and rewind it
I like to fuck it, I never suck it
And if you're dumb I get you sprung just like a cluck
Bitch, hey, DJ Quik is in effect for the 9-0 season
Skeasing is the reason, cause I'm so damn pleasing
Quik is the name and if you think that I'm appealing
Then go for what you know, baby, because I got that feeling

DJ Quik,"One day I was chillin' on Araabie and spruce
Forty in my hand and it's time to get loose
Got my Nikes, Fila t-shirt, and black khakis
I heard a horn blowin' and I jumped in my jacket
John was chillin' in the passenger seat
Stepped up out the car and started dancing in the street
Now John was lookin' fresh and it wasn't no joke
He had on some fresh khakis and was sportin' some Locs
Some gangstas poppin' wheelies came up from behind
He got off throwin' up his favorite gang sign

Here come Little Snub, from the Maple block
Groovin' on the handlebars, ready to rock
And now my posse's gettin' bigger, 'cause of all these niggas
I got the .38 and I'm about to pull the trigger
Looked up at the corner and who did I see?
Wayne and his little man Pop and Nookie
Now Sha came rollin' up on a little scooter
Lookin' for a match so he could light the Thai huddha
I told him I didn't have it, but yet I went to grab it
I lit it up and hit it up, and now I'm draggin' it

Wayne took a hit, Pop took a puff
Nookie started chokin' and now he's fucked up
The forty-ounce is hittin', so I busted into school
I'm never gettin' sweated 'cause I'm just too cool fool
Sun's goin' down and now it's night
My posse's cold chillin' and we're feelin' alright
We heard a lot of noise and it sounded like a rally
Boomin' ass sounds comin' out of Sherm Alley
We all jumped up and we started to stroll
A young nigga like the Quiksta was takin' control

The D.E.A. posse so deep we walked three twos
Now if you want to join then you gotta pay ya dues
We got up to the alley and everything was chill
They was just makin' that dollar dollar bill
Reesa came down and she sat on the stairs
I stood up 'cause I didn't have a chair
Now Pop said, ""Yo! Let's get some cuts
Get that Old 8 so we can get fucked up""
Now I'll put a twenty H put a 10 
And said, ""Fuck it! Super soca and gin""

Now everybody's gettin' in the twilight zone
Head up stairs and they're gettin' weirdo
Gangsta's on the steps and he's tryin' to bang
No belt in his khakis so his Lee's could sag
Here comes Stick with a twenty dollar bag
But he can't roll a joint 'cause he ain't got no zigzags
I looked up at my watch, it said 10:28
You better run up to the liquor store before it's too late
He went to the store and he got the zags
He came back walkin' with my homeboy Cash
Sucka came over he was lookin' for a ride

Runnin' from the police, he ain't have no place to hide
A smile came on my face when I swallowed my beer
I'm chillin' like a villain and I got no fear
Now Tony Lane came he said he was bored
Eatin' on some chips that he got from the store
I said I'm bored too, so what's up with that?
Wayne said ""Is anyone down to jack?""
Now I can get the AK and you can get the pump
But I don't want no deuce-deuce, 'cause I ain't no chump
Now Mike said, ""Dane which one do you choose?""

""I could take the .38 and you can have the Uze""
But before we can jet and be on our way
Some niggas rolled up and they was ready to spray
Rollin' real slow, they turned off the lights
Waitin' until the time was right
A fool jumped out all dressed in Guess?
(Yeah) shot him in the chest
The niggas tried to jet, but the couldn't get far
'cause Mike had the uzi and he aimed it for the car

Ha Ha 
Now that's how it's done and we do it good
Just another day in my loked out hood
Now all y'all remember that we can't be stopped

Well keep lookin', because the see-A-M-E-O track is cookin'
Like a big ol' pot of neck bones, we'll tend to fire up
Because a young brother like the Quik is gettin' wired up

You know my offbeat style is flowin' all the while
I'm showin' suckers, they can't get none of this
Let alone some of this, I'm a musical genius
And if you fuck with my roll {""Face, down, HUT HUT HUT HUT!""}

I beat yo' ass as if uh we was playin' Tecmo Bowl
I'm a producer if a rhythm is dope I choose it
And I hope you know I'd rather +BE+ dope than use it
I was a Player in the Penthouse and now I'm uprooted

I let 'em know - Quik is the Name

This beat is gettin' funky just like a skunk

I just remain plain and kick the facts
Bout how a nigga can't keep from gettin jacked

You gotta hold your own at any cost
'Cause if you don't boy you might get bossed and tossed
By a sucker who claims he got more game than you
Bein' true is what you oughta do

Or you just might find some chrome pointed at your dome
Think fast or you might not make it home
See a nigga like myself ain't goin out like that
Because I found that it pays to pack a gat

The shit you be talking, I label it 'caca'
Move your fat ass and pass the vodka

[DJ Quik]
Check it out...
Now I be knockin' bitches like it ain't shit
'Cause I'm a playa motherfucker named DJ Quik
Yo, maybe it's the way, I hold my dick

That makes all the girlies want to ride my tip
But some of these bitches try to act unfair (why?)
Maybe its because my hair is longer than theirs
But I don't give a fuck, no I don't care

Because I'm like Noah's Ark - my bitches come in pairs
You see I'm 5'11"", my dick is size seven
And if a hooker's fine I can stretch you a nine
It goes deep (how deep?) All up in that shit

I'll fuck a pussy dry 'cause I don't know how to quit
I'm 19 (say what?) so I'm a young ass man
My eyes are brown and my skin is tan
So pull them cotton-ass panties right down to ya knees

If you want to take part in a proper-ass skeez
I'm more than a playa (word?) I'm more like a pimp (yeah!)
I love black pussy but I sure won't simp
I got the bitches on my jock like an airplane wing

And only way for me to get 'em off I have to sing
I say, ""Oooh hoe, don't jock me so,
Never-ever-ever want to let me go,
Once I whip this dick on you!"" Hey, check it out

I say, ""Ooh hoe, don't call me no mo',
How in the fuck can I let you know,
That I'm a motherfuckin' troop!"" (Aw yeah, word 'em up!)
Now that ought a tell ya right then and there

That I'm a true motherfucker so ya better beware

Girl ya best be prepared to fuck because I love black pussy!
I can't help it cause I love black pussy...

I got to have it, just like a rabbit - black pussy..
Black pussy.. what kind?

[DJ Quik]
Yeah... and I'm takin'
All the money from these funky hoes that I be breakin'
If you say that there's another Quik then you're mistaken
I am not a coward and you'll never see me shakin'

Never breakin' lots of money that I'm makin'
If you double-cross me then I'll be your undertaker
I will never be-friend you because you are a steaker
Open up your mouth if you want some beefsteak-ah

If you suck it long enough you'll taste a milkshake-uh

Suckers they... aww shit, hold up man
	
This the wrong motherfuckin' page and shit
Aww shit, I need to start on the..
Oh okay, here we go: 
	
Black pussy! Always talkin bout it 'cause I love it
Women get grown up just as soon as they let me rub it
And in a week's span, my homey Freak-Man
Sinks into so much pussy we should call him Quik-sand
(Last hoe was done by the true motherfuckers
 from the P-E-N-T-H-O-you-S-E) Players Clique

Tweetey's in the cold room, Freaky's in the studio room
I am in the livin room, and Hammer's in the bedroom
Freakin' (Or should I say skeezin?)
Call it livin large in 1990 because playin be the reason

So many freaks we have to forward the calls
And when the girlies hear the.. {*beeper goes off*}
... they pause, and get hot (how come?)
I think they know what time it is

They should know that's how we handle our biz (gotta handle it)
They shouldn't trip and call playin a sin
Because it's in and we're all black men so we love black pussy!
And ya know that, because we show that!

Yeah...
Aww yeah!

You have no game with your girl 'cus I chose her
I grabbed her hand, I took her backstage with me
We tore it off my friend, now she's yours again

So if your girl's Little Red you better take her home
And hide her, before I try to ease on up
To push up on the butt

'Cus a brother like the Quik is chillin' with a feelin'
For a fly female because I'm able an willin'
To tell her the things that make her hot like a cup of tea

Because there ain't another nigga more versatile

And this song is for the homies who was down with me
When I was broke as a joke, flat with no mon-ey
And to them doubtin-ass motherfuckers, cause they don't know yeah
Instead of showin and provin yo I'm provin that I'm the show
Now who wants to fade this modern day prophet?
Take two steps forward, one shell and you droppin
Because I don't go toe to toe, I go hoe to hoe
Yo' hoe is so-so, so yo, I think I better let her go
Cause she ain't worth my time

Cause the power of the Quiksta's too overwhelmin
And when you let me rip I'm goin in with a helmet
That's why your little brother wants to be like me
I'm surrounded by the trueness that suckers fail to see
Now 2nd II None, is you down with the Quik? ""What you think?""

One chocolate nigga up to no good
Yo I gotta watch my back, cause it's like that
Too many fools on a mission

Tryin' to put in work for a hood they ain't even got they ass in
Everybody got beef, with me and my crew
But ain't nobody step yet (so what the fuck they do?)
Talkin' all day shit

Runnin' they motherfuckin' lip worried about who a blood or crip
Man, fuck the red and the blue team
Fool, my color runs green
And it'll stay as I choose

And if my homies ain't down, they catchin' the blues
They want to stab me in my back huh?
But soon as they do, I'm comin' back at cha
The same go for a bitch

She want to fuck and be good, 'til the money maker switch
And then I'm out on my limbs
Be got a grip on myself, and kicked the bitch to the wind
'Cause my trust goes to no one (yup)

And sometimes - I can't trust my damn self!
It's a god damn shame
Ain't no reason to blame, one fool or one game
But it's life and a nigga gotta deal with it
Man, I'm just tired of the bullshit

Now if the gangsta shit is what you're cravin for
And the funky ass tape is what you're savin for
Then look no further, cause I'm the brother
And I'm a break it down and kick the shit once more

Now the niggaz tryin to disrespect the q they get knocked out
Niggaz tryin' to disrespect the crew they get drug out
Niggaz tryin' to catch a nigga slippin get snuffed out
And bitches tryin' to set a nigga up they get carried out

And yeah that bucket that you ridin in, when the glock roar
That's the same motherfucker you'll be hidin in
Fifteen holes, flat tires and you're windows gone
Now what's really goin on?

From Denver to Phoenix and even St. Louis
Everywhere we went, fools tried to do us
And to the suckaz thinkin' that a nigga wouldn't steal
How your jaw feel, and is your nose healed?

Somewhere along the line they musta heard the rumor
Of my underground days mixed with bangin and humor
And when I got on stage, they all jumped in my way
Shoutin', ""what up 'cause?"" just to see what I'd say

But I ain't trippin, just checkin' a grip
I ain't crippin' or even ruinin' blood'n, just smokin a bud'n
Gettin' bent, so if you want to see me throw a full fit
Then come up in my face with that bullshit",No Bullshit

Because I jack these hooker hoes for they ten's an' they five's
An' twenty's then I leave 'em branded 'cause I'm the love bandit
I'm not tryin' to be mean, I want your green or you'll be stranded

You're gonna have to kick up or eat a dick up 'til you hiccup
I treat yo' ass as if this was a stick up
'Cause you ain't nothin' but a pick-up

My name is Quik and I'm smooth, and I'm making yo' ugly bitch move
With the streets you can't lose, but if you still want to choose
To be a sucker, I got a 380 punk, so duck her
And to you motherfuckers thinking you want to fade me?
I'm running the underground, so fool, you're crazy
And you better step, 'fore I beat you with a switch
And tie you up, and make you watch, while I'm fucking yo' bitch
Cause I'm a low-pro nigga that you should not fol-low
Putting suckers in the wind cause my voice is hollow
Put the pistol to your grill and your punk ass rolls
You grab my shit and I pull the trigger now you're missing a nose
And umm, I don't fear your crew because my back is got
Chasing nothing but the suckers when we hit yo' spot
Yeah, straight Bronx killer, mark ass niggas can't check me
But gotta respect me, cause I'm Way 2 Fonky

People be approaching me, all throughout the swap meets
Asking me shit like, ""When your new album coming out?""
""Is it different?"" ""Is it dope?"" ""Where yo' perm?""
What you talking bout?
I know you don't expect that a nigga gon' quit
Being nothing less than funky and banging out the dope-ass hits
Cause DJ Quik is a name that I take much much pride in
No egoes to hide in and no limos to ride in
Maybe a Cutlass or two, but still the same ol' shit
And me unclever? No never, I'll have this talent forever
The producer get funky down to the last ounce
And I'm creative too, so I don't need ""Mo' Bounce""
But to you suckers in my city claiming I got a ""Def Wish""
You should try again fool, you ain't hitting near this
Them wack ass tracks, make you sound like a monkey
Just a shot in the dark, from a punk-ass mark who ain't Fonky

[Chorus]

[DJ Quik]
Now when you records ain't that funky then it's easy to disrespect this
Cause you know that when I hit I didn't miss
Just like that ""I'm Born and Raised,"" you wish you could fade
And when you picked up that album cover you knew I was paid, Tim
Cause we ain't going out and we ain't stuck in that old school shit
That boring flavor that just don't hit
Cause this is ninety-two, and yes yo' style is through
And if your record ain't selling well fool I thought you knew
That this is straight Bronx killer, straight Bronx murder
Yeah yo' city's a dump, and fool yo' shit don't bump
And 'member the ""Jack the Rapper""? Yeah, your punk ass sat
That's when my homeboy D, was bout to flatten yo' cap
And you apologized to him, started kissing his ass
Saying you only dissed Compton for the money, so he gave you a pass
But you ain't moving shit on the streets
Get off the nuts of my city with them wack ass beats that ain't Fonky

DJ Quik,"When you a G, niggaz wanna be like you
Because a G has images what they look up to
But some don't make it, so they takin' the funk
They get hot and they be poppin' that gangsta junk

But that ain't G, that ain't even close, nah that ain't shit
It ain't about who can bang or slang the most 'caine
And ki's or O's, sport new clothes
Or about who can fuck the most hoes

'Cause it's a mind state, it's playin' it's manipulatin'
It's winnin' from the freakin' and maneuverin' and then captivatin'
Livin' the life that make the bitches wanna fiend and dream
And all the jealous niggaz mean and scheme

And weak minor suckaz they wanna show they ass
But a nigga like Quik'll check 'em real fast
They don't know the real and so they quick to assume
That's why they shut up when I enter the room 'cause I'm a G

Playin' tough
But them niggaz ain't really rough
Creampuffs is a better word than tough

When you a G, attention is yours
When you demonstrate power
And game the untrues imitate
They get frustrated, they sock girls and slam doors
But when you're a G you just check yours

Takin' up the slack, all the way around
And then my back got yours, then we ain't goin' down
Like Playa Hamm said, it's the thing that I pray for
And play for, that I slay for

'Cause I'm the G when it comes to a funky track
I'm the G when it comes to the whole sack
I'm the G when it comes to decision makin'
I'm the G that got all these niggaz blinkin'

I'm the G that's young and intimidatin'
I'm the G never sprung got the bitches waitin'
I'm the G suckaz fear because I'm strong
And I'm the G, never standin' alone

Fadin' 'em, left to right, front back to center
I'm a natural born winner
I got connects on a quest to be true
So I won't teach you what I know
I'ma teach you what you know, yo

My game is tight so if you're lookin' and listenin' and learnin'
Apply it to yours and you'll earn respect in abundance
And you can never be checked see
When you're a motherfuckin' G

y'all better get hip
And come off this trip
Wit'cho [Unverified] killin' asses

The G-ness, when you a G it's the description
The suckaz are fearin' it
'Cause in the mack they keep on hearin' it
They wish they could neglect it
But they can't so they disrespect it

And when they run up, yeah they get chin checked
When you a G, backs to backs never duckin'
Suckaz freakin' yo' bitches though, dismissin' the hoes
Before a bigga nigga, when you a G you're the teacher
Any other way that I coulda come just might not reach ya

The G-ness, such as my gangsta mentality
The G-ness, such is the greatness of my pals and me
Destiny's testin', trueness of character
Since I'm a G, fuck with my brothers that fucks with me

Come to the Penthouse if you want if you aren't true
And journey through the mind of a G since he ain't you
It ain't just the mack or the sack or the strong back
It ain't just the plain simple fact we got all that

It ain't just the dead weight, that we droppin' daily
Crews I don't forget, 'cause my memory don't fail me
Those that know, know I know that they do
Those who are wondering?

(Motherfuck you)
I only owe to P.P.C. a chosen few
I got players all around me, doin' what they want to
The rise of the wise got suckaz droppin' like flies
When you a G nigga, peepin' the prize from these eyes

Low down, niggaz, what?
Low down, niggaz, what?
Low down, niggaz, what?
Niggaz, what?
Niggaz, hell yeah",When You're a Gee

[Verse 1]
Getting right back back to the nigga named Q
Telling my homies be careful o' the things that you do
Cuz I went out, assed out
I shoulda never tripped and put my lips in between hips
But I used to eat that thang that didn't sit on a plate
Didn't taste like stank I up and left about 8
But I had to build her make for the fact that I was young
I was showing to prove the hoochies I could work they pearl tounge
But then game got kilt
Cuz the girl kept pushin' my head all up under the quilt
And I was like damn, you must be sick
You mean you'd rather have a tongue
instead of a pair o' nuts and a stick (You goddamn right)
And every single night, I lick it till my tounge turn white
I thought I was a freak till I heard my homies brag
(Eating that coochie make you grow a mustache)Ya!
So I took that advice and right before I hit it
I took baby monkey lift it up and I bit it
Yeah homeboy I had the coochie in check
But then I got this real bad cramp in my neck
Now my back got so'
But this little ho kept a humping in my face like we was on the dance flo'
But thats what I get for having Susie Q for dinner
Got stuck in her creamy pink center
Help me

Chorus: (Voice Box)
(don't eat the coochie) You gotta hear me tho'
(don't....eat the coochie)
(don't....eat the coochie) A he he you think its a joke huh girl?
(don't....eat the coochie)

[Verse 2]
Well my nigga, you ought to save yo' self some grief
If it ain't worth havin' a little hair in ya' teeth (don't fuck with it!)
Ya cuz you'll come up sho't
With a full pair o' nuts and a lump in ya throat
Cuz even though shes screamin
She don't want ya semen
She just want a tooounge to keep her ass creamin'
But Im'a let her know baby doll I can't do it
Not in here and fuck cuz all coochie got a taste to it
See I don't know who been digging you out
And licking ya down
I aint the first girl so I can't clown
But instead Im'a tell you how its done
You gotta tell a ho 68 and I owe you 1
Cuz if you don't then she'll play you like a sucka
Have you lickin on a lollipop......{dumb motherf.....}Ya
But it aint no trippin on mine {Why is that?}
Cuz tounge condoms are hard to find {Yeeeah}
And even if ya dicks protected
You can still catch the high by doing a nose dive
So be cautious and don't be anxious
Even though you never could now you wanna catch ST-Statures
(Now you wanna catch ST-Statures)
But niggas still put they nuts in a frier
Then they get burnt and they wanna fight fire with fire
And then a bitch back
But the song that don't bare back
And please don't eat the coochie

Chorus: (Voice Box)
(don't....eat the coochie) Yeah.
(don't....eat the coochie) You better hear me baby.
(don't....eat the coochie) I can't do it girl
(don't....eat the coochie)

[Verse 3]
So now ya know
Aint nothin' fly bout' the pearl tounge lickin'
And be real safe with the girls your stickin'
Cuz if ya' bare back way back in the day
Then you could be on your wayyyy out! (On your wayyy out!)
And it don't get no brighter
When youre walking round with a tounge like a lighter
Bic (Bic) flick sparkin' often
Sittin in the middle o' the clinic coughin'
Hurt by the die hard bare back feelin'
They got shook like kids from a sinnin'
Dwellin' all in your system
Killin' ya slooow
A real jacked up way to go
So next time you get a fi-fi in ya bed
Make sure you gots you a helmet for the head
Have her wash up if the ho is a hoochie
And keep your mouth away from that coochie

Chorus: (Voice Box)
(don't....eat the coochie) Repeat 7X
You gotta hear me baby

What do you mean?

You know, would you like, think of someone you might wanna fuck?
Yes

It's like ah, how you like me now?
Mista Quik up in yo ass like a dog of puppy chow
Cus I'm diggy-diggin the guts out
Then I'm takin my nuts out
Rinsin' ‘em off then I'm moppin' out
So you tend to think I'm 5'11 but I'm six feet tall
With enough dick to have you climbin' up the wall
One nuts, two nuts, three un four
Then I wake up in the morning and I bust two more
'Cause that's the freak in me, and yes I'm very doggy
Playin' with your coochie till it's nice and soggy
Saddle up the horsy then I ride West to North, East and South
And then I put it in your mouth
And shoot a missile
Right up where you whistle
Kiss it, lick it
Hoochie mama you know where to stick it
'Cause if I couldn't fuck you wouldn't be in bed
Bittin' on my pillows and bumpin' yo head
Because, I got the dick you want to know betta
I've got the nuts that swang togetha
So here's a promise from me to you, if you ever want to get the bone up
And do the grown up
Then we can handle this baby, just don't get loud
'Cause I'ma cover up your mouth bitch, while I'm diggin' u out

Makin' hoes know whether thin or fatter
And if you don't believe me then it really don't matter
'Cause diggin' it, pullin' it, yankin' it, bringin' the damage to your bladder
And I'm knowin', you knew they job was dangerous when you took it
You played your pussy like bait and let me hook it
So remove your dentures
And, by, plus it's not just a job it's adventure

DJ Quik,(Now I got to cut ya...) ,Get at Me
DJ Quik,"Baby baby  baby  baby  baby 
Who taught you how to do this shit? 
Yeah  you bad than a motherfucker 

Tell me  why are you so curious 
And why you keep on starin' 
At the motherfuckin' zipper on these jeans 
That I'm wearin' cause baby what's in there 
Is beyond your wildest dreams 
And although it seems that I'm on the nigga hoe team 
Girl  listen  listen  Mary don't you weep 
I don't come cheap and I'm not just no nigga off the street 
I'm a certified specialized pro 
Who's got a lot of soul when you're swingin' 
Off the end of my pole 
But the matter at hand is the size 
And how it makes ya act 
When you get it up and in between your thighs 
You could squirm and squeal and try to make a deal 
That'll keep me on your jock 
For whenever you get that feelin' for the real 
And when it gets swollen 
You think you'll be controllin' me 
Because I put the pole in your hole, see 
But however it's done, it's 68 and I owe you 1 
I'm doin' it for the thrill of it 
So tell me can you feel it? 

Itz your fantasy baby, tell me if you feel it 
You know you want to feel it 
Itz your fantasy, sing it if you feel it 

Okay, let's find a place, somethin' out of dodge 
Like the Quality Inn or the Travelodge 
Since I'm goin' out of my way 
Baby you pay for the spot 
See it's only right since you gettin' the cock 
Now tell me who's gonna get the rubbers? 
First things first, yes I like a bitch 
Who carries Lifestyles in her purse 
So since you know the play 
Close the curtains all the way 
And get ready for a toss and some rib sauce 
With a little weed I could do a good deed 
And as long as you ain't bleedin' 
I can give you what you need 
But I got a little ritual before we make love 
You gotta dish-a-dish-a-scrub 
Wash-a-wash-a-wash-a-rinse in the bathtub 
Hennessy and apple juice to sip on 
Get a little buzzed and we can get our dig on 
So don't trip cause when you 
Takin' off your clothes to reveal it 
I'm a make you feel it 

Sing it if ya feel it, it's your fantasy baby 
Touch me if ya feel it, I need to know if you feel it 
Can you feel it baby? 

Now put it where you want it, get in where you fit in 
Cause when it comes to hittin' it, splittin' it 
I ain't bullshittin' 
See, you look so good you make me want to go bare back on ya 
But I ain't hittin' unless I use the whole pack on ya 
Bitch didn't ya know I have more stamina than a horse? 
So don't trip just let the Hen take it's course 
Yeah right now your frontin', 
Shy, actin' like you nervous, naw, turnaround, lay down 
And let me pound on your cervix 
Yeah, it's the Log Ride, like at Magic Mountain 
Take it out your mouth and shoot it like a fountain 
Pull and watch it explode 
Let me change my tire and I'm right back on the road 
Now is this more than you expected? 
You let me drive that coochie and I wrecked it 
So even though I'll never get another chance to kill it 
It's cool just as long as I made you feel it 

Itz your fantasy, tell me if you feel it 
You know you love it, sing it if you feel it 
You make me feel it, I know you feel it 
You know you feel it, tell me if you feel it 
Sing it if you feel it 
Yeah, you feel it, I love to make you feel it 
Oh, you feel it",Itz Your Fantasy

Did you miss me?
It took a little time to get sucka-free
But since a young g it's PPC 
Ain't no shame in the name
And still true to the game
Still serving suckers, just the same
No sense, and dwelling in the past tense
I roll with Quik, so you better check your ladies, gents
Cause I'ma teach her how to break you, right before I break her
After I make her, then I shake her
Yeah, I know, you heard it all before
But I can't deal, cause I see you're still simping for a hoe
Claiming pimp, but you're paying for the pu'
Silly sucker, punk motherfucker
They only flock and jock
Cause you're filling up they pocketbooks
And you're still judging bitches by they looks
When it's really all about what she can do for you
I do for me and still see a True
Ah-ha, really? Do you hear me, bro?
Got your name all on your lips, but your chick trips
Oh no, never will I lower to your level
And I got 17 for ya, devil
Too True to ever let a sucker like you 
Make me do something that I don't want to do
I'm still real with it, you got's to deal with it
I serve that ass like a clocker, I don't give a fuck
But who you're doing, how you're doing
Or what you do it with
You better miss me with the dumb shit
So when you're speaking on the Playa Hamm or my nigga Quik
Everybody knows you're sucking on a fat dick
It ain't nothing to nothing in your ass, so that you see clear
Booming in your ear, so I know you hear
Bump this in your Coupe with your R&B want to-be-me
Trick-ass, I'm sucka-free",Sucka Free
DJ Quik,"Now even though I was only a young buck I was still trying to kick it.
Having a gang of fun, and much too young to be wicked.
'Cause when I was thirteen you know we didn't have cars.
It was either double ride the peg nuts, or hop on the handle bars.
And then we went and bought a gang of balloons and had
A water balloon fight that lasted until the night.
Then after that we played some ""hide and go get it""
With the neighborhood homegirls dumb enough to be with it.
All in fun and games and keeping it cool,
But my, my, when you're kicking it, time flys by;
'Cause every hour's a minute, and every minute's a sec.
And if I'd came home late my moms would ring my neck, yeah,
But I regret not the whoopings I got.
'Cause to be able to play the next day was okay.
On a mission, to hit up the neighbor's fruit trees;
Just a bunch of kids chillin', enjoying the summer breeze.

[Chorus]
Summer breeze, flowing like the wind;
Boy, you need to know that you got a friend.
It'll always be me; (I'll always be here.)
It'll always be me; (I'll always be here.)
It'll always be me; (I'll always be here.)

Now I'm growing some fuzz; getting older - like seventeen, eighteen,
And the only thing I know is to stay clean.
T-shirt, short pants, Nikes on spotless.
I was even old enough to buy me a Cutlass;
A little vehicle to ride around town, play with the hos, and
Roll down the window and mack to the one who's chosen.
Yo, them biker pants is looking kinda right on you.
My name is DJ Quik, and my homies is having a barbeque.
Before I finish my whole sentence complete,
She was off the bus stop and in my passenger seat.
And we was sliding to the Westside, stopped at the store
To get some farm; 'cause that make 'em kick it a little more.
And at the spot, you know that chicken was kicking.
The pig on the grill, and, so, the day was chill,
But that night my girl was tipsy and ready to skeeze,
But I didn't even trip; too busy jocking the summer breeze.

[Chorus]

Now I'm twenty-three, and I remember the times when
We was chillin' like villians and didn't have no nines.
Like when we used to mob to beaches to kick it and swim.
Now I hang around and watch the tides come in,
And I'm thinking how many funerals I've been to.
Watching all my homies get buried in them boxes they put 'em into.
And then I read a letter from upstate, from my homie G-Wayne,
Who's been locked up since '87, '88.
And it really ain't nothing fly about it,
So he go: ""I'm a stay strong, or I'm a break down and simply cry about it.""
And when it seem like things just ain't gon' be right
I gotta thank my creator for letting me sleep last night.
And wake me up in the morn 'cause I shutter to think
That could be me dead, or locked away in the clink,
So I'm lifting my homie's spirits as tall as the trees,
And I can even hear him calling me, in the summer breeze.

[Chorus]",Summer Breeze
DJ Quik,"Yeah, welcome to Club Hub City

You can tell almost immediately that I'm aced off
So listen muthafucka why you comin' off hard
My objective is to catch you off guard
Get covert & infiltrate yo' clique
Crack yo' shit & mack yo' bitch
Now tell me could you conceive a nigga all up in her beaver
Givin' her the love fever for hours at a time before I take a breather
And when she tell me she loves me I don't believe her
'cause I rock in stereo or mono hot like gonno-
Rhea burnin' everytime you take a pee uh
So when you see a nigga out with his girl
Then baby play like you don't know me & we'll keep in a twirl
Because baby I go deeper than the deep blue seas
Baby do you really want to play the flute on me?
I'll give you a sack & take it back & you'll die to get it

Smack the booty with no pimples

Into a pool of pimp piss but this hoe had the audacity
To ask me for a dollar even though that's all I had left
These greedy lying ass hoes'll fifty cents yo' ass to death!

[Quik:] 

Ha ha yeah check it out money & pussy make the world go 'round 

(That's right) That's how it's been since the beginning of time. 

Now who says we can't be fly? 

Who say Compton niggas can't get they scrilla 

At the same time get some thigh 

Well uh that's the subject of my conversation 

Cause ain't nothin' like gettin' a dollar & some penetration 

Now that's a whole lot easier to understand now a days 

But uh some of you playas still be going out sideways 

So umm just take this game with a tic tac 

Cause if you was on Skid Row you can get 

Pussy faster than a Big Mac 

I owe it to myself to be fly that's what Top Dog taught a boy 

Cause instead of Mounds these bitches always want Almond Joy 

Because uhh ""Sometimes they feel like a nut"" 

But they rather have it more often than they don't 

So I won't go flippin' & makin' it topsy turvy 

Now keep my hundred dollar bills crisp & that ass curvy 

Cause ain't nuthin' on my mind but to be fly through time 

Havin' a nest egg bird behind an estate that's mine 

Watchin' Jordan go for forty in a sucker tub 

Eatin' Cheetos drinkin' Mo' & getting a back scrub 

Because first you get the power then you get the money 

Then you get the pussy dude don't be no dummy uhh 

Chorus El Debarge: 

Playas get they paper when they game is tight 

And if you want some nana that's for you to decide 

But as long as you ain't simpin' then ya doin' it right 

'cause together they go hand in hand Oh yeah

She want to make me break code but I can't 

I want to fire it up & hit it pass it like dank

D baby I'ma get ya hot want to get ya full blown 

So we all can hit the spot (now you gotta shake the spot) 

Got game by the tons lookin' for some 2nd II None 

Kinda fun but these hookers on the run for cover 

They lookin' for lovers ain't no trickin' young D 

'cause I'm unlike the others not a buster 

I'm on the mission for figures time up for you diggers 

(Now who got the Henn'?) Pass the liquor 

Hoes hear the name it get's 'em hotter 

Spin a scraggler on a wheel now they call me D the Potter 

Lotta hatin' going on but I ain't with it 

I'ma mash on that drama everytime that I feel it 

'Cause I'd rather have a major end than have sex 

And when I have a million to splurge you know what's next 

But first you get the power then you get the money 

Then you get the pussy fool don't be no dummy

Yeah first comes the power then the money heh 

And if you really just want it the

I understand that you think you grown 

Independent on ya own with ya jazzy ways 

My intent is ya lay but first I'm out to get paid not played 

Can't be yo' incredible edible egg 

I don't crack nor split my yolk with the female folk 

Now baby break yourself get broke you can choke 

Off this young black better than Mary Jane 

In ya brain I'm guaranteed to have ya thinkin' & feelin' thangs 

Like yourself now uhh watch ya health if ya feel like plottin' 

Ya body turns rotten from the inside out that pussy's turned out 

Getting hit by a sucker a 2 minute brother 

Who's first 10 seconds is thinkin' he came up 

That next full minute suckin ya drama up 

50 seconds to go see half of that is the show 

Now where the other half you can't laugh 

'cause you know it's straight simpin' & whinin' 

'stead of pimpin' & grindin' KK'll let you know 

So pay attention bro 

See first you get the power then you get the money

Hella hoes mobbin in pushin gettin through 
Tiger striped cat suit lookin' at me to 
I asked her what's your title and she said it was V 
Vanessa you impress a nigga can't you see 
What you doin' later can I kick it with you? 
She said it all depends on what you want to do 
Took me me to her buddy walked in the room 
Buzzin off the kamikaze that I consumed 
Talk,kiss,grind tryin' to get get my balls off first 
She said nigga can you take my draws of first 
I was young I admit it 
She told me I was horny and wild but still let me hit it 
Hot bare back until I felt that quake 
She told me shoot that milk shaker shoot that milk shaker 
Goddamn I don't want to get sprung 
Take it out the pussy bust a nut on her tummy 
Ran home to tell my nigga Top 
About this cock that just wouldn't stop yeah 
I told him she was green-eyed light skinned and fly 
He said he met a bitch like that last July 
A car pulled up and it was her no doubt 
I told him that's who I'm talkin bout 
He said that's who I'm talkin bout damn

Now here's the plan 
In the home of the one night stand

To hit the backside,and get the top love 
Bucknaked in the hot tub 
Cause she knew who I was and what I am and what I is (who are you) 
The flyest nigga in the rap biz 
And there playin my song so a nigga gotta go and uh 
Put a hoe in the limo 
She was askin me question after question 
Until she seen my life size erection

DJ Quik,"Yes, MGD is the beer for me
Ah, MGD is the beer for me, that's right
MGD is the brew for me, that's right, yeah

I'm the Q to the U to the I to the K, okay?
Each day, I play my way, that's the fly way
And I'm older than a motherfucker, but they still ask me
For my ID, when I buy MGD, feel me?

'Cause I've got [Incomprehensible] in my family, uh huh
And I've got bitches that's finer than Vanity, hmm
Plus I'm not living above my means, buying Rolexes and rings
Flossing cars that I can't afford, lovin' these bitches and whores

You know, I never broke myself to see no hoe
Never did time, never took no pride in bein' cruised
Don't give a fuck about a pink slip, loose lips, sink ships
Hundred miles at least, when I sign a new lease

I never trick off my fanny with these bitches
You got to be clever, gots to keep your mind on your riches
And stop doin' the things that keep you broke
And keepin' niggaz names in your mouth
That you shouldn't have spoke, no doubt, I'm dope

In this game eight years, some of my peers have moved on
I proceed to succeed, I've stayed within my zone
I'm the baddest motherfucker, yet it's me that you despise
Look within yourself and find out why you wear that dumb disguise

No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
Now run and tell 'em what I'm all about

No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
Now run and tell 'em what I'm all about

From the low bottoms to the skies, I got 'em open
On the scrotum they blowin' like it's chronic, high hopin'
The P never leaves, be conceivin' 'em like intercourse
Up in somethin', keep 'em comin', Playa Hamm be the source

Of the force you now witness, and this is just
Another stone in the succession of the nutties I bust
The homies told me don't put no cut on it, keep it raw
If you want 'em bangin', P clique swangin' down the shore

Tricks out here, tryin' to make hits instead of makin it hard hittin'
And perpetratin' frauds when they spittin'
The game is full of twisters and misters quick to do low
Victims of vendettas and busters infraredders, you know

What type of forty it is, when in the presence
Of the G's, pushin' P's, players, we be the essence
For life, it's the JB and pimpin' Carl
When LTD we havin' it all, no doubt

No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
Now run and tell 'em what we all about

No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
Now run and tell 'em what I'm all about

Now I'ma tell ya straight up, one nigga planned on havin' hands on
Messin' with what I stand on, but trick you find to get ate up
I feel like a [Incomprehensible] but this pimp ahead of me
Has [Incomprehensible] to within an inner trace of the mind
Disintegrates her kind like battery acid

You never got no money from a hoe or seen my max
[Incomprehensible] buddy be somethin' broke
I'm a pimp, but you don't know
You better stand up, now empty out your purse I told you
Get out, I don't trust your ass, now throw your hands up

Take it to the bump-bump-be-ba-dump
Dip, give me my chips, witchcraft
Now let me see what I can check you with now

Excuse me baby but, didn't I look you in your eyes
And tell you what you was?
Told you somebody sent you, but this here's what a pimp does

Ho, what, you can't see me with it, why, probably 'cause
I stay G'd up from the street up
And subject to make your trick, go get it

No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth

Check it if you want to but it's all in vein 

Because me game is stil the same

I never rode a pony but I'm genuine 

So give me just a little bit of nicotine 

And a sticky greeen 

And I'm a hit it with the icky cream 

Booyah I hit her on the neck with a whip 

And made the hooker jump without a safety net 

Hit the ground break her back 

Get up and do it again because she can really take a shot on the chin 

caffeine cappucino chase it with some no-doz 

Up all night like the moon glows 

Searching for new hoes 

They really want to follow my lead 

indeed and give a nigga just what I need 



Chorus: 

When I'm on speed 

I'm faster then most 

And I can rock a party from coast to coast 



The Q-you-I-K is the name I spell 

124 beats per minute I rock well 

Because I'm tight to the second power 

When I hit the liquor 

And I don't serve emcees 

I'm serve dickas 

Bang bang boogie 

When I hit a shot of loogie 

And the Booger try to put it on me 

But I get that moves to show her 

I flaunt it like Noah 

I strut backside like a Boa 

Constrictor when I dicked her down 

Game feel just like a circus clown when I work this 

Jack of all trades 

Master to few 

Test these test these 1, 2 

Gettin down with my nigga AM to the G in the PM

Faster then the concord 

On board 

Call me the pilot 

Baby better let me know she's excited 

In the testerosa 

Sipppin memosas 

Girls want me to sign posters 

International with the steelo 

Got hookers from Cancoun to Reo 

Fire (?ignite it?) 

But we don't even try it 

You can't but it 

Got freaks have to hide it 

Hit the weed up 

Then turn the speed up 

The booty from the backs the only way I eat up 

Quicker than Jackie Chan 

I search off the Goochi like a rubber band 

You want to be more than the average man 

But the hoe needs more a job in a man 

And a retirement plan 

So baby don't cry the blues 

Cause I know a gang of hoes in your shoes

DJ Quik,"Ha ha nothin but the best from the best 
You feel me? hear me 
This is dedicated to that special someone 
You know who you are and you never gave me a chance 

I used to watch you walk to class fine as can be 
While I'm standing here with K.K. and D 
And I did a liitle bit of everything just to get your attention 
But I knew you had no eyes for me 
I used to get up sharpen my pencil for nothin 
You watch me watch you rollin your eyes and you still was bumpin 
So when test time came I was all in yours 
With no bubbles on my papers just some low ass scores 
I guess you can call it puppy love I was a scrub 
Having fantasies of me and you up in my tub 
Makin love in the soapy water,having my daughter 
But I knew you liked them baller dudes and, I did'nt have a quarter 
I admit on the rainy days it was sad 
Cause it was'nt about who you was but what you had 
Now I'm doing swell baby and you know it's true 
Back when you had a chance you should've let me breath on you 

Sittin in my room thinkin bout you 
Reminiscing on the kinky little things we did'nt do 
I said I'm sitting in my room thinkin thinkin thinkin 

I'm Sittin in my room thinkin bout you 
Reminiscing on the kinky little things we did'nt do 
I said I'm sitting in my room thinkin thinkin thinkin 

Now I called you on the telephone baby it's david 
The last you gave a chance is the first to save it 
And I'm just tryin to hook us up for another session 
Because I have'nt learned my lesson 
Plus I got positions never ending 
Now I'm descending down into your valley baby work your tendons 
Doing what I do to make you do what you did 
To make me come so hard that we almost had a kid 
Platinum that's how I descibe your thigh 
Tell me how come your so young doin shit that fly 
You must have came from the school of hard knocks 
Lickin on hard rocks and blowin off tube socks 
Now whenever it's time for fun 
You got me blowin up your pager with 911's ha 
Now show me a little affection 
But hurry up before I lose my erection 

Because I'm siitin on my couch thinkin bout you 
Reminiscin on the kinky little things we used to do 
I said I'm sittin on my couch thinkin thinkin thinkin 

I said I'm siitin on my couch thinkin bout you 
Reminiscin on the kinky little things we used to do 
I said I'm sittin on my couch thinkin thinkin thinkin 
(Check it out) 

And now I'm sittin in my spa thinkin bout you 
And you baby doll don't even have a clue 
I'm just sittin in my spa thinkin thinkin bout you 

I said I'm sittin in my spa thinkin bout you 
And I'm doin rather swell in ???? heaven yeah it's true

DJ Quik,"Ain't no puzzle y'all, we, uh
Groovin off the spirituality, and it feels good
I got somethin to say though

It's time for somebody to take over the West Coast power with fly style
And I'm the one, been here for years so check your file
Cuz I'm the kinda nigga with a strong desire
To nutt up, light a torch, and set the world on fire!
See me bouncin in my 'Vette, Doin' donuts in the middle of a Reseda
Wit Rosarita, tryin' to find some place to eat her
Cuz I'm freaky with a capital L
I'll beat up that little pocket pita til there ain't nothing left
I'm nasty
See, we gets better when you think we hot
And we got more cheddar than they think we got
Cuz see we make the kinda money that when we withdrawl
They notify the feds cuz it's too much y'all
What you call a stash, we call it petty cash
Spend five or six figures a month ain't left a gash
Party all night, then we sleep all day
Drink Corona X for breakfast then we ready to play
I still like 'em green eyed big ol' titties and thighs
Big ol' nigga, little heart, and I'm big into thighs
So shoot your game baby girl, don't be scared to take a pet
You never know, it just might be wet

We still party, It get's high
Sometimes we don't feel grown-up and that's no lie
So we party, 'til we die
Cuz life is much too short for you to not be fly

Now whether or not I be drunk off a gallon a Moet
I can still make the beats stink like some salmon croquette
Go to the hood and get all the kids that I can fit
In a limo take 'em to the store and buy 'em some shit
Give 'em a demo of my new shit cuz it's the shit
And let 'em know that they the shit
And they can make hits cuz it ain't shit
I gotta keep the cycle goin, baby doll
Whichever way the wind be blowin', I'm goin'
Higher than a motherfucker, Mr. Dante
C'mon B back me up each and everyday
Whether it's hot, whether it's cold
Whether it's soft, whether it's bold
Whether it's new, whether it's old
Whether it's GOLD, platinum, I stack 'em
Dante, baby dog, we be fly
Freestylin' like a motherfucker don't ask why
Cuz this ain't Budweiser
""BUD"", ""WEIS"", ""ER""
""Did you see the, thighs on her?""
We nastier then a motherfucker baby doll
Can I freak your shit, and, uh, break the sugar walls down?
To the pound pound, uh huh
Elements, Feel my elephant, hahaha

We still party, It get's high
Sometimes we don't feel grown-up and that's no lie
So we party, 'til we die
Cuz life is much too short for you to not be fly

Now can y'all feel that? See, ain't nothing but God mackin' goin' on right
Now, see? Da game is to be told and not sold dependin' on which game it is
And we gon' keep it way real, you know? Cuz' it ain't no doubt in nobody's
Mind that I'm a very blessed individual, there. If we don't turn it around and
Give it back than we can't we can't go forward, it's up to you. That's what we
Do everytime we get on this microphone, we let 'em know that we might be
Street rappers, but we are very much in order, and we got somethin' to say. So
If you feelin' me like we feelin y'all, get yo ass up on the ball. Time to
Take this shit back. All of it. Cuz it was ours to begin with. Don't sleep
Baby. Don't sleep homey. Now when the hook come back again
Youknowwhati'msayin?

We still party, It get's high
Sometimes we don't feel grown-up and that's no lie
So we party, 'til we die
Cuz life is much too short for you to not be fly
We still party, It get's high
Sometimes we don't feel grown-up and that's no lie
So we party, 'til we die
Cuz life is much too short for you to not be fly

Ay, come here miss lady
Check it out, well meet me half way there now

'Cause I seen you in the front of Players Magazine in the main edition
And it ain't gon' kill you if you give me yo number
What's happenin'? Can we hook up later or something? Thank you

[DJ Quik:]
I like the way that you don't say much
And when the homies give you phone numbers you don't stay in touch
With that proper little mystic about your ways
About your style that got your boy dazed
Now I'm diggin' in my game so I can see where you at
And I'm pushin' all the buttons that make you come exact
I know you recognize I'm young and I'm gifted and black
That should be enough to have you sprung and fidgety in ya cat
But yet you play it off swell
To see if I'ma give up on the pursuit of your tail
But even if you knew that ain't all I wanted was just to bone it
I'm still detectin' ego trippin', baby you own it
But you don't understand I know parts of you that you do not
And I can penetrate right down through your through-through spot
Because I'm talented and young and I got a lot wealth
And I'm the bomb baby, now what you tell me 'bout my self?

[Dionne Knighton:]
Whateva you do
You make me want to touch myself
Whenever I'm with you 'cause you got it (Who go it?)
And I'm gonna make you give it to me (Yeah sing it to me)
Whateva you do
You make me want to touch myself
Whenever I'm with you 'cause you got it (Say what?)
And I'm gonna make you give it to me

[DJ Quik:]
C'mon, we can go to my house, we don't need the hotel
Now lay down by my fireplace and drink Sip & Dale
While I massage your feet, and you massage my neck
And I won't make a move on you long as you got self-respect
Now check it, I want to see what you look like in spa
With nothing on yo body but yo panties and bra
Grand Mar in ya flava down your neck and your back
Aha, didn't know the Quiksta could do it like that
You actin' different on the liquor baby girl is that you
The ways your eyes sparkled when I bit yo tattoo
You're rugged but soft baby you're sowed up with fears
And you gotta like pleasure and pain with your naval peers
But I appreciate you lady 'cause you're makin' me wait
Even though that little game you playin' is much outta date
I'ma save it for next time and I hope you will too
'Cause I like the way you do what you do, baby girl

When ever I'm with you 'cause I got it
You make me want to give it to you

You know you want it, I can see it ya face
That you would rather be somewhere with me takin' off your lace
To a bikini shavin' pubic
I'm a diamond, he's cubic
You gave him yo love and he blew it
Move, let me do it
Because my love is like fire and ice, I'm like bitter sweet
Me and my peaches, and you and yo pretty feet
Knowin' that if I lick it, tell me then I get closa
While I'm urgin' you to drink this Mamosa
Because you know that I got the skills that make you get them crazy leg spasms
By helping you to reach multiple orgasms
Ya hear me? Now feel me, you know what's happenin'
So hit me on my hip when you want to get it
And I'll be over there twenty minutes to hit it
Just as long as you stay cool and you stay true
And just keep on doin'whateva you do, baby girl!

[Dionne Knighton:]

DJ Quik,"Lay there, please don't move baby.
On me, don't you stop.
Doggy, comin' through baby
Watch me hit the spot.
You make me wanna speak Spanish
You make me wanna be manish
Nothing could compare to the way we keep it hot.
Strawberries soakin' in amaretto out in the limo.
Be spitty, got the car lookin' pretty, in the window.
Lets hit the indo
Commit a sin in this crescendo.
Smoky, foggy
Take off your coat, lets hit the doggy.
Pull out your scrunchie, let me play through your mane
Long, brown, nice and round, explorin' my brain.
Selective and picky when we get wet and get sticky.
In and out, without a clue, not even a hickey.
Love it or leave it, addictive like crystal to meth
And it's hard to let go of me when I shift to the left.
Never like what you're happy for, I'm more than a man.
I can even make you feel me when you're usin' your hand.
I'm confident, like an MVP
Got the key to the CPT
Lookin' for a G like me
She F-E-M-A-L-E
Where you be at?
True love only can be that.
I'm tellin you that you the shit.
Call me when you get this hit.

Do I love her, do I need her? (Suga Free: nuh uh)
Do I take my money out and feed her? (no, no)
And should I treat her (no, no) like no other? (nah)
I don't know I think I need to ask my brother Suga Free.

Do I love her? (uh huh)
Do I need her? (Oh, yeah)
And when she tells me she loves me, I don't believe her (yeah, you do)
No I don't love her, (mm hmm)
And I don't need her (Yeah, yeah)
And if she don't give me me money I'm a leave her.

See baby, I got a spot to fill.
And all that callin' me out my name gonna have you 
Runnin' down the street barefooted again sayin' ""not for real!""
And how you gonna blame mine?
Dawon and Suga Free the same person
But you will never catch me and him in the same room at the same time
Baby, you not yo best, I called you 
'cause I was broke, hoeless, and short on these little ends
And it wasn't for no sex.
I see you still messin' wit yo phony ballers.
But when they tired of you 
You run yo lil ass right back over here beggin' me for 20 dollars.
And mighty funny (mighty funny)
You get nice than a mug with them hugs, actin like you in love
With a nigga, when you love money.
What? you stuck?
Hoe, if I tell yo flea to pull a tree
You get a chain and hook his lil ass up.
Quik'll give you a piece of his planet.
But I'll give you a dirt rock
Half a low quat
Not a dope spot
Nor a piece of this pomegranet.
Baby wanna eat-eat?
'cause Suga Free-Free
Will go gleek-gleek
And tweak-tweak
And put yo all to sleep-sleep.
Ooh, I'm a tell (I'm a tell)
Suga Free pop a beat and spit a rap so swell.
She said, ""suga free, you know anything about cars, honey?""
I said, yeah, you fill em up with hoes
Take em to the hoes store
So they can get that money!

Do I love her do I need her? (suga free: uh uh)
Do I take my money out and feed her? (no way)
And do I treat her (no) like no other (man)
I don't know I think I need to ask my brother suga free.

Aah, do I love her do I need her? (DJ Quik: Oh, yeah)
And when she tell me she love me I don't believe her (yea you do)
Do I love her? (mm hmm) Do I need her? (fo sho)
Leave me 'lone, leave me 'lone, Devil be gone! I'm leaving (yeah)

See, that's what y'all get for underestimatin me and Suga Free. 
We told y'all we was magical, way back in 1996.
But y'all didn't feel that. Y'all chose to sleep on us.
Baby, we so powerful, we can make the rain stop (Rain, ne me nome)
You feel that?

Do I love her, do I need her?
Do I take my money out and feed her?
And do I treat her (mm mm) like no other? (naw) 
I don't know, I think I need to ask my brother Suga Free 

Ooh, do I love her, Do I need her? (DJ Quik: mm hmm)
And when she tell me she love me I don't believe her (yeah, you do)
Now do I love her (mm hmm) or care about her (you should)
You ne me nome, ne me nome, fore I lock you in that box again

Do I love her do I need her? (Box again)
Do I take my money out and feed her? (ne me nome!)
And do I treat her a-like no other? (yeah!)
I don't know I think I need to ask my brother Suga Free

Ooh, do I love her, do I need her? (sure do)
And when she tell me she love me I don't believe her (she need you too)
And do I love her (mm hmm) or care about her? (you outta)

To the police, y'all gotta start us out
Xzibit dun came I'm here and got a nigga high

Now how come y'all be messin' with me
When you find out that I'm a star?
(How come?)
And just because I'm cool with y'all
Don't mean you can search my car
(One time)

And if you don't wanna spend the day with me
It ain't always gotta end with sex
(Yeah)
She likes it that I'm always into finer things
And I can donut in an NSX

Aight, now first of all fall in
'cause we gon' talk about how we was ballin'
Before most of y'all niggas crawled in
Bitches callin', tryin' to get the dick of the Quikster
'cause I was rich even before I could buy liquor
Now this is thicker

Although I came to the game with an explicit sticker
It be the little kids acknowledging that I'm the nigga
I'm sorta like a role model, they love me
I ain't half-assed, pullin' full throttle

Now pass the bottle but hold up for me, pal
Could you make it a corona with Limon Esalle?
And could you send them in these on
So we could show these down

So all my little Hispanic homies could pound-pound
This is underground-ground, the new WS sound
But I'm thinkin' that y'all thinkin' that we all just clown
But we gon' take the crown back
'cause if the west be a movie, then this be the soundtrack

Nice to you fuckers, then we next to fight
We get down and get out, when you see them coming
Cut the shit out, 'cause they gon'' put us on the bench
And make us sit out

So put a hit out on the authorities
'cause they thinkin' we don't know they got a sorority
Fuck the who? I ain't sayin' hit like in death
I'm talkin' hit records crackin' when you bust that left
Outta Carson and Watts

South Central L.A., back to your spot
Compton niggas, we got the show shot
Orgasmic beats that keep these hoes hot
Put your lips on my glass, you're doin' a whole lot
Ball till you fall, nigga

99 bottles, I'm buyin' the whole wall
This is the role call, nigga
All us fly niggas gon'' ball

Uh, but it's a whole new lineup
Will and Skaboo comin' through with the brew
'cause KA drunk the wine up
Five in the mornin' and the phone's still ringin'
Been a nine year party ever since I started singin' tonight

But it's a whole lot betta
It ain't no jealousy, no snitches, or no feda'
I'm gittin' drunk, I'm sayin' fuck it with my friends
And I'm spoiled, 'cause my muthafuckin' bucket is a Benz

And I'm lookin' for my niggga X
With the hydroponic, bubonic, bionic
Chase it with some gin 'n' tonic
Now who got the balls enough to hit that bong
And straight pass out ,'cause the shit that strong?

But the 1's gotta leave us alone 'cause we ain't' doin' wrong
I'm the music and Black Tone's the backbone
Got your daughter back grown
Ebony and Ivory, baby, the little white girl
Little black songs, get on

Now how come y'all be messin' with me

DJ Quik,"Well, shit, check it out
I done found out that's there a fine line between brilliant (uh-huh)
And bein' plum loco (oh fo' sho', hell yeah)

[DJ Quik]
Get back, get forward, get raised, get lowered
Do some extreme shit, keep from bein' bored
Now it's double up, hoes come a nickel a dozen
They get hot and get fucked and don't remember from buzzin'

That's why you don't see me, I ain't at the club
I'm chillin' with my homies in the city of Hub
Because they needin' more than that hoe (than that hoe) the big fat hoe
Tryin' to get every ballin' nigga in the saddle (yee-ha!)

Lap dance, fat chance, hot pants, you the man
Nowadays you can't tell, watch the crotch, it may swell
You needs a pap smear; you need to know
If you got an STD, some little critters in your trap dear

Get on, me and my homies is indivisible
And don't floss money, looks better when it's invisible (yes)
We get props from Wall Street to why'all street
If ya missed it, I stay consistant, we got heat

See-P-T style, O-G me style
The D-J, Q-U-I-K with no see style
In yo' town, don't trip nigga, it goes down
And when you see me in all blue, you gon' frown

But I'm bridgin the gap, I'm rigid with rap
Money or respect bitch, I'd rather have the digits than daps (tell 'em)
So give me the haps, do you want the meat or the scraps? (c'mon)
Put heat on my naps, and now my hair look sweet on my lap (always)

'Cause it's the same thang tryin' to kill the gang-bang
Set examples for the kids, on how to maintain
Never be a lame brain; y'all ain't gotta feel the same pain
That put a nigga like me on the mainframe

Bow down, back up nigga, I'm hot now
And don't try to resuscitate me, when I'm shot down
Just call my homie Theo on the radio
And let him know his little homie Quiksta had to go

Because ""Gangsta, Gangsta,"" that's what they yellin'
But niggaz do dirt, get caught, and start tellin' (shut up!)
Talkin' to you G's with no heart
We was throwin' and runnin' from bullets before gangsta rappin was an art

Nigga (nigga), so don't test ya bullet-proof vest (nah)
'Cause real niggaz do real things up under stress
That's from the C-P-T, Young G with heart, too
Oh we still party, but now it's part II
And

[Hook]
I don't want to party wit you... hell naw
'Cause bitch you scary
You 20 years old, with 3 kids, 7 tattoos
You're bald, but your legs are hairy
I don't want to party wit you... hmm, hell naw
You need to put some lotion on
'Cause your skin is peelin' around
Them bullet wounds on your back
You're fat, plus you're abortion-prone

[DJ Quik]
I'd rather be a young exec, than the puppet on the other end
Danglin' by a noose on his neck
They can't handle me, cause I'm where the {scandal} be
An underground nigga on Arista, now there is the family

That I'm a roll wit, take control wit
Have a ball, break bread, and share the store wit
Even though I'm thirsty for money, in the worst way
I ain't go cry if I don't go platinum, on the first day

Watch me, get my hustle on with the friendly competition
Y'all got papers but I got the latest edition (extra extra)
A hundred-thousand dollars a truck, is what I crack
And if you ain't got that, keep wishin' (we all about it)

And to you bitch-ass niggaz in the maze
Comin' at a player with {homosexual} ways
Keep lickin' on that other sound
And stay north of the 105 Hip Hop heads, cause this is underground

Yeah right by the water, can't do right by ya daughter (no)
But look at all the shit that I done bought her (hmm?)
See lyrics ain't nothin' if the beat ain't crackin'
And these beats smackin', that's why the G's keep stackin', nigga

[Hook]
(I don't want to party wit you).. hell naw
'Cause nigga youse a scuffla
Your braids is dingy, your clothes ain't got no creases
And your lips look like you sucked a muffler
(I don't want to party wit you).. hell naw
'Cause bitch you didn't know me when you was fine as wine and thick
Now you're sick from smokin that shit
You're broke and plus you're boney

W-E-S-T, see-O-A-S-T
That's where the hydroponic with no seeds be
So don't trip when you see me on the TV, or my CD
And my eyes are really are-E-D

See the {industry} is freak (shh shh shh), pardon me for bein' speaky
Snitchin' on y'all that want to jeek me
What makes you even try that way?
Yeah I might be fly, but I don't fly that way

Hmm, even on a gallon of Cisco I could never go disco
Dude I ain't from {'Frisco}
And to these bitches y'all trippin', we ain't layin' wit y'all
Just because we say we want to fuck we playin' wit y'all

This is entertainment, we tryin' to make us some change
We ain't impressed by what you got up under your Hanes
Bitch that's yo' trap, and that's yo' sap
Let me spit the cap while she sit in yo' lap homie

Don't you know me? Jealous-ass niggaz want to flow me (why)
Just because yo' woman want to blow me
On the strength I give that hoe a tittie-toy
'Cause I'm the only ugly nigga gettin' away with bein' pretty boy

(I don't want to party wit you).. hmm, hell naw
Now this is how the sporty bounce
We stay away from you broke-ass niggaz 
Always beggin and ain't got a dime on the 40 ounce
(I don't want to party wit you).. hmm, hell naw
'Cause hoe you to' back, with that ol' long ass roll
And ya stockin smellin like Avon and that horse want his 'fro back
(I don't want to party wit you).. hmm, hell naw
And nigga I can't stand ya
And I ain't got nothin but some advice, 
A map, a bar of soap, some water and a towel to hand ya
(I don't want to party wit you).. hmm, hell naw
Now I'ma be real wit it
All my fuckin life I ain't never wanted fame
But since the shit done came I gotta deal wit it
(I don't want to party wit you)
Ya know, but I'ma do it like my homie say

DJ Quik,"My name is Quik, yeah, this is true
Keepin' your attention is what I'm gonna do
Hardcore yo, I could never be soft
Askin' me my defin' they say the boy goes off

Fillin' up my memo with the touch of my rhyme
Suckaz stayin' with me 'cause they know the time
Quiet on the set because I'm about to begin
And if you didn't hear me boy I'll tell you again

My name is Quik or just call me Q
But it doesn't really matter to you
'Cause I'm the same person
Whether serious or rehearsin' I just gotta keep cursin'

This is for the radio so I better chill
They won't play it if I co get ill
But I'm like that and that's an actually fact
Because the street is where my heart is at

Yo, I don't do dope but I'm dope not a dope
But I'm doper than anybody who trys to cope
If the rhyme I'm dispayin'
And the beat that's playin'

Yo you could try all day
And you still won't match up with the ruthless P.O.W.
'Cause Quik's doin' it Compton style
That's the city and you say you could get some yo
It's quiker said than dunn

Woo, woo

They made it easy for me to get my point across
So listen up close if ya don't ya might get lost
I'm not a role model nor a Dr. Seuss
But I'm not a gangsta and I'm about to get stupid

I guess it's time for the drama
With the Q you I K comma
Now that's drama so pay attention
By the way I must mention I'm comin' off
Hard in the third dimension

With the glare but you don't need no glasses to stare
It'll probably take you in and it's just like your there
With the Q on the Compton tip
So if you think I'm a flip or slip don't even trip

'Cause I'm a destroyer
My homie Theo is a DJ not a lawyer dope, fly employer
On the static, that's my station to get the money, the women
While we dippin' round tha nation

Boy, Mister Quiks of toys
I mean straight while ya suckin' with the girls enjoy
You must be sick or ya lonely
How ya gone still my name if ya don't even know me

Blak Tone, what's up?
Get the gat show 'em where it's at
And that's just the sound and next time
I'm peelin' ya cap to let ya know where I'm comin' from
Quik said it and it shall be dunn

Woo, woo

Creatin' dope jams are the part of the cycle
Quiker said than dunn, yeah, that's the title
Rubbin' the lady's only the fly once ya know
But would if she's ugly, if she come she a ho?

Don't ask to battle me home boy
What's that you wanna battle me boy
Ya better be strapped 'cause where I'm from
It ain't all about that playin'
Now that's what I'm sayin'

Sevy thought that I was born in '73
Now everybody wants to know the A G E
Girls on the tip fellaz too it seemed
Had everybody thinkin' I was only 15

The fellaz would annoy me the ladyz would adore me
And what was I to do I wishin' nothin' ladies do
'Cause the ladiez I luv 'em nice and then soft
I hate male groupies so just step the hell off

I'm the real Quikster 'cause others be fakin'
Tryin' to game fame off, the name I'm makin'
Sayin' on your records you could get some
Yo home boy, its quiker said than dunn

Just a Quik dedication to tha creator of Gangsta Rap music
Mr. Erik, Eazy E, Wright, that's how its done

Woo, woo

Strawberries soakin' in amaretto out in the limo.
Be spitty, got the car lookin' pretty, in the window.
Lets hit the indo
Commit a sin in this crescendo.
Smoky, foggy
Take off your coat, lets hit the doggy.
Pull out your scrunchie, let me play through your mane
Long, brown, nice and round, explorin' my brain.
Selective and picky when we get wet and get sticky.
In and out, without a clue, not even a hickey.
Love it or leave it, addictive like crystal to meth
And it's hard to let go of me when I shift to the left.
Never like what you're happy for, I'm more than a man.
I can even make you feel me when you're usin' your hand.

And it wasn't for no sex.
I see you still messin' wit yo phony ballers.

You run yo lil ass right back over here beggin' me for 20 dollars.
And mighty funny (mighty funny)
You get nice than a mug with them hugs, actin like you in love
With a nigga, when you love money.
What? you stuck?
Hoe, if I tell yo flea to pull a tree
You get a chain and hook his lil ass up.
Quik'll give you a piece of his planet.

Half a low quat
Not a dope spot
Nor a piece of this pomegranet.

One two three four five six seven nine, ten, Eiht you can't win
'Cause all the way around nigga I gets respect
And youse a nigga that can't even get no props in your set
Tragniew Park you say huh

Wanna be rippin', but now it's time to do some set trippin'
So listen close, 'cause I don't want y'all to miss
That I'm bout to break it down for this bitch, check it
Acacia, Poplar Maple Spruce Cedar Elm
West side trees sprayin' all the fleas
That's from the three and four hundred block P-Funk riders
So niggaz watch yo' ass at that center divider
Now Aaron Tyler, tell my why you seem so tame

When I caught you at the airport, shakin' like a crap game
You looked up and you seen my niggaz comin
And you looked like your bitch ass was 'bout to start runnin'
But all I wanted to do was kick a little conversation
And see if we can fix this little situation
But would I fuck you up was what you wondered
Yeah, that's probably why you changed your little pager number
But bitches like you don't grow

You can't even look me in my eye, let alone go toe to toe
And callin' me skinny, youse a clown
I'ma call you Theo, 'cause you weigh ninety-two point three pounds
Wack ass actor, movie script killer
Fool don't you know, Quik is still the nigga
Compton psycho, boy you oughta quit
Your records don't hit, and bitches don't jock your shit
You need to stay down you Compton clown

And get off of the nuts of the niggaz with guts
Because I'm down with the Trees, I'm down with Death Row
I'm down with Black Tone, and I'm down with the fo'
So when we cross paths and I hope that's soon
I'ma boot your motherfuckin' ass to the moon
You need to quit bangin' under false pretense
'Cause if don't make dollars, it don't make sense

If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the people, commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
Because you gotta give it up to the crown prince

Now I'ma swing it to the right and, right into the left hand
Take a deep breath and, cook it like a chef and
This is dedicated to the see-P-T
No better yet T-T-P, or the niggaz that look up to me
I make it my business, to be that true forever
And whenever I can come clever well that's my endeavor
So whether or not you understand, that there's only one DJ Q-you-I-K
With no see still you can't be me
Because I'm floatin' in my Lex and, depositin' fat checks and
Gettin mad sex while I floss the NSX and

Doin' what I wanna, and youse a goner nigga
For thinkin that you can catch me slippin' on a street corner
Remember Compton's in the house, and Quik is in the hood
Sippin' yak with all my niggaz 'cause it's tooted good
So don't knock it till you try it, 'cause Eiht he tried to knock it
But he's still walkin' round with my nuts in his pocket
So put tha P in it represent and sip that Miller
And for those of y'all concerned, this is still Eiht Killa
Let me take a load off my scrotum little pest
If it don't make dollars nigga, you know the rest

If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the people, commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
Because you gotta give it up to the crown prince

Now I done sold my fuckin' soul to the shit that I kick
While you groupie ass niggaz keep on ridin' the dick
You oughta know that DJ Quik ain't your average
Everyday motherfucker, slick like a snake 'cause I stuck ya
Now, I never had my dick sucked by a man befo'
But you gon' be the first you little trick ass hoe
Then you can tell me just how it taste
But before I nut I shoot some piss in your face
You fuckin' coward, tremblin' like a nervous wreck

'Cause when I caught your ass, you put yourself in check
And when you left my presence, you left expedient
You ain't no fuckin' killer, youse a comedian, beyotch
Tell me why you act so scary
Givin' your set a bad name wit your misspelled name
E-I-H-T, now should I continue
Yeah you left out the G 'cause the G ain't in you
Remember that time you was rollin' on the West side
And a little brown bucket pulled up on your side

Caught at that light in your Camry in the midst of a
Real killer, tell me did you feel a little nervous
You was in the shadow of death with two trey-five-sevens
Pointed at your chest whatchu gon' do, where was your
Niggaz that kill at you ain't got no killers so kill dat
Holdin' up your hands and beggin' for a pass
You lucky they didn't just to get to dumpin' on yo' ass
'Cause this game you think is funny is some real shit
So you need to be more careful who you fuckin' wit, beyotch!

If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
I'm through playin' with your punk ass
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
Because you gotta give it up to the crown prince

Shouts goes out, to my well known road dog
What's up Dozun Tru, they don't understand it baby
They can't fade us out here on these Compton streets
It's bigger than they can imagine to the whole entire
Death Row family both sides, whassup niggaz
And my nigga Big Suge, known for keepin' shit poppin'

To my nigga Big J, my little nigga Hi-see, little straight G
And that little singin' ass nigga Danny Boy
Y'all don't understand, y'all can't fade this
I'm the first nigga that was ""Bangin' on Wax""
Yeah if you remember, nineteen eighty-seven underground tapes
And it don't stop, and it won't stop

With no cussing and shit
I tried
But I still gotta do this

Yo
Jingle jingle
We've go the lingo
With so much heat it's hard for us to pick the first single
It don't matter 'cause I'm underground anyway
Rich balling, bitch call and fly any day
You dirty niggas why'all too whack to dance
Why'all need to ease up off that now before why'all splint why'all pants
And leave that up to my niggas, young fly niggas
Getting down you and I niggas don't try niggas
I changed my mind I don't want your bitch
'Cause sorry ass women just don't get rich
You could keep her
I'd rather have a fifi bag because it's cheaper
You can't come up for NL
I gets deeper
And my hold is so cold, it's a sleeper
So pass the reefer
And to you false balling niggas just grab your crotches
But if you paid nigga pat your pockets

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
And for sure
You've got yours
I've got mine's and we're balling
So call up everybody
Let's pitch in on a party for sure

Alright
Somebody play the potato
Let's take a ballad
On who gonna invite the hoes that make the party valid
'Cause we don't need a whole crib full of dudes again
And here come the police with them big black boots again
Kicking niggas out
Hand cuffing and stuffing they banging jacky chicken in they mouth
And time to shine pitching a fit
'Cause somebody rolled her bud in a heeny blunt and won't pass the shit
Who keeps turning the lights on?
Why the music keep skipping?
And why these dirty khaki niggas tripping?
I don't know I'm Quik and I'm still delighted
Five hundred dollars worth of white star
About to hide it
'Cause why'all ain't drinking mine up
You better drink that Anj and Palmason and the rest of that wine up
You party haters need to stop it
I think we really about to pat your pockets
 
[Chorus:]

Hey baby
My girlfriend left me today
So which one of you old ragedy ass bitches want to come in here and play?
That's what my homie told and try to cop the Cancun
Then I caught him in there hunching in my downstairs bathroom
And in the kitchen and up in there on the dance floor
By the big screen t.v. where your pants go?
Some of you niggas I swear
I try to throw why'all a ragedy ass party
And why'all don't even care
Cigarette burns in my plush
Empty beer bottles in the brush
And my bitch acting like a lush
Boy what else could go wrong?
Somebody kick the extension cord out

Move!
Why'all gotta be some of the clumsiest muthafuckas

To the sounds, now some
Why'all done fucked up
Get out, get on
Speed up nigga
Get up, take your weed on
Ya nigga, the drunk nigga said it

Some believe in love and some believe in friends 

But niggaz like me believe in making ends 

Cause even when your bitch wants to trick around 

You know the moneys got you safe and sound 



Now i'm bout to take it back to 84 when I was 14 

Kickin back in the trees 

Westside if you please 

And 436 west spruce was the spot 

With me Wayne  Mike  Shot  Nookie  Slug, and Rock, 

Donzelly if ya with me than let that shit kick 

If your head ain't spinning from dippin all them sticks 

Cause way back in the day they used love a wet baggie 

Screaming ""HORALE ESE"" with them laces on a caddy 

And you could'nt deny 

A hit from that buddah tye 

Going round and round the driveway 

Now it's coming my way 

And i'm zoned out at a young age 

And the whole spruce street was my stage 

Peep now back then I was in the 8th grade steady 

But niggaz my age was getting paid already 

Yeah like that nigga Zam or even young Blue 

They made they first million by the age of 22 

Like Dan from Cedar block him and little Motor 

James from Piru street with them boulders 

Rest in peace little Noopy he did'nt have to brag 

Rollin to the 10 grade in a fint 0 rag 

Well Goddamn how can I be down? 

I ask my sister Jack for some help and she told me look around. 

Nigga they don't sell dope it sells itself 

While they kickback and just collect the wealth 

And now i'm thinking ain't nothing fly about these dirty ass khakis 

T-shirt dingy, prowings tackie 

This could be a way to flip that little funky twenty dollars that I earned 

Right then is when I learned that 



(chorus) 

Some believe in Jesus 

some believe in Allah 

But niggaz like me believe I'm making dollars 

Cause even when yo niggaz want to be untrue

Peep I gets a dub on the 1st and 15th for a fact 

So instead of spending it up I gave my money to Jack 

Now she jump in the regal and said i'll be right back 

When she came in she put me down with a plastic sack 

I turned my 40 into 80 and that was my profit 

I'm keepin my rocks in the house and not in my pocket 

Sister Jackie in the kitchen with some boiling water, baking soda, 

Fresh powder, baby bottles, making more boulders 

Checking a fat grip slanging rocks to tricks 

Donzelly dippin sticks went and bought um a 6 

And 500 block peach running thangs ya see 

Moving gallon after gallon and key after key 

I'm telling you I done seen it all 

From niggaz hitting the sherman and the passout on the wall 

From cluckers wanting a hit so bad they let there panies fall 

Teeth rotten hair gone, 

and whole checks get blown 

But then i'm still breaking these pebbles like bam bam 

Saved them, splitting rocks, 

to the um tic toc 

I went from wearing khakis to Sergio Teccini 

While my rocks is disappearing like the great Whodini 

I bought a gang of clothes, all of my equiptment 

And getting somthing new with each and every shipment 

Money gets made and money gets spent 

and how these jealous niggaz acting only makes it evident that

Some believe in Jesus 

some believe in Allah 

But niggaz like me believe I'm making dollars

Cause even when yo bitch wants to trick around 

You know the moneys got you safe and sound 



Check now in 1988 I moved away to L.A. 

My niggaz Playa Ham and Gina gave me a place to stay 

On my way up from bottom rock 

Bitches starting to jock 

Cause my hair is getting longer 

And games getting stronger 

To pull my on weight I went and got me a job 

But by then Ham and Gina really started to squab 

About weather I should go or stay 

She told him either he goes or you go we both was on our way 

So he moved and took me with him on 2001 Browning, 

clowning with playas all around me just astounding 

My nigga pimpin Carl got staring with that hair an 

Rolling up and down the street in that rag 7 with Darren 

Shaby blue feathered as he swerved 

In the El Co p-6 park away from the curve 

Big Jam L.A Mike, Darryl, Nicki on the bike 

That nigga Top, Big Shane, and Tweed rolling up the weed 

And hoes just come and go in and out 

Revolving door leaving with some nut in they mouth 

I'm making a living of pimpin so you fools can't trip

And when you see me on the streets in a black jeep
Know I got the heat up under
Not up under the seat, up under my cheek
Like so close to me that when I move it squeaks
I ain't no big buff dude I'm a rap singer
I exercise one muscle that's my strap finger
And I can't call it how I see it no more
Cause these niggas'll take ya words back and twist em' like a pretzel
And these bitches be the same too
Comin' with that sob story crocodile tears trying to gang you
And that's exactly what the game do
And if you ever get caught dirty with a nigga she gon' blame you
So what in the hell you want to floss her for?
It's supposed to be bout' what a baller nigga cost that ho (yeah)
You givin' a game of black eye in ya S-5
While you niggas kick back poppin' X you let that 'cause' dry
And that bitch supposed to carry her own car note (c'mon, yep)
And don't be going for that shit ""I got a sore throat"" (yeah)
Give that bitch a couple of Sucrets (mmm hmm)
Or give that that ho that application down on Vernon to that duplex (see ya)

Do we play ball? Do we move that weight?
All I got for a motherfuckin ho is hate
Bitch want to get drunk and high
Point that booty on to the sky
Square ass bitch go bake a pie
Get a tattoo of a dick in ya eye
Want to be flied call Continental (bitch)

for layers of words, let me say it in terms that you can understand
So clearly, you feelin' me fam?

Move faster than me, then I recognize

How could I lose my identity?
How could we become our own worst enemy?
Even at the park, we don't party whatever
Not familiar, because we are hardly together
Cyber gangbangers, Internet gimmicks
How did all my fans get replaced with critics?
Went to sleep and woke up in a world full of limits
And being humble is synonomous with being timid
Niggas annoy me, so I frighten them
They stalk and hunt me down, 'til I enlighten them

I'm in a Chevy, with the top dropped

You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
So without further ado, I bring to you

Marshall!

You 'bout to witness hip hop in its
Most purest, most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest, known artist
Chip off the old block but old doc is
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges (boom sound)
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes 
Yeah, here I come
I'm inches away from you, here, fear none
Hip hop is in a state of 911, so

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!

Quick gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers Dre, holy bat syllables
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals
So, skip to ya Lou, while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it was 'til everyone knows the shit
The most hated on outta all those who say they get hated
On eighties songs
Exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up
There's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival
Come on! Now

[Chorus: x2]

It's just like old times, the dynamic duo
Two old friends, why panic?
You already who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center eight hundred
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton, play career Russian Roulette
And never even seen me blink get me bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see a MC who breathes so freely
Ease ova these beats, and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy
How can one Chandra be so Levy
Turn on these beats MC's don't see me
Believe me, B-E-T and M-T-V
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear into the mountains
Nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here
Yo Dre!

Can I get a hell yeah?
Hell Yeah!

(Ring, ring) Hello, is Doug E. Fresh here
(No, he's not in right now)
But anyway, no more delay
Just check out the new style I display
Now you got to be fresh to rock wit fresh
And I'm D-O-U-G-I-E Fresh
And I'm know for the...
Not for the...
The human beat box on the entertainer
No other label that fit me plainer
In a passing generation, I am a remainder
And I'm also known as a beat box trainer
Cashing checks, make sound effects
And after I'm finish rocking, Slick Rick is on next
(You know it) Slick Rick

Well, here's a little something that needs to be heard
Doug, I was walking downtown (Word Rick) word
(Sure) All along, no one to be wit
Step on the D-train, 205th
I saw a pretty girl (so)
So I sat beside her
Then she went roar, she was Tony the Tiger
I said, oh darn, there has been a mistake
Honey, my name's Slick Rick, not frosty flake
(Oh, golly wolly) She was raising hell
She said, um, my name is Maggie but you can call me Michelle

But something feels so wrong
It seems like lately
Your feelings are not as strong

I see it in your eyes
I feel it in your touch
I hear it in your answers
When I tell you I love you so much

I can't read
What's runnin' through your mind
But if you think its over
Just tell me, tell me, tell me

Go on and find another woman
Who is just what you need
You can go try but I won't stand right by
Why you wonder, wonder, so please

Go on and find another woman
Whose as good to you as me
Just wait and see that there's no one like me
who will love you, love you, love you like I do

Now you know I need you
But honey I've got my pride
After all this time you should tell me
What you're feeling inside

If you're trying to protect me
Then you're not being fair, no, no
'Cause I deserve a real lover
Not someone pretending to care

I can't read what's going through your mind
But if you think its over, tell me, tell me, tell me

Go on and find another woman
Who is just what you need
You can go try but I won't stand right by
Why you wonder, wonder, so please

Go on and find another woman
Whose as good to you as me
Just wait and see that there's no one like me
Who will love you, love you, love you

Go on and on and find
I hope she's just what you need
You can go try but I won't stand by
While you wonder, wonder

Go on, go on, I hope she's good to you
Just wait and see that there's no one like me
Who will love you, love you, love you like I do

Who will love you
Who will love you

DJ Revolution,"Bust it 
Hey yo, I just left the studio, and it's about 2 in the morn' 
I just finished doin a song 
Now I'm ready for sleep 
But first I want spaghetti to eat 
In this good Italian restaurant right up the street 
So I jumped in the jeep, stash the heat under the seat 
Then I got a beep 
My voice is harsh, barely can speak 
I called back on the cell 
It's Coley, mad as hell 
He told me to listen well as he started to yell 
""I just seen Mike and Ben with your wife and a friend 
And they just got a room in the Holiday Inn"" 
""It's my wife, you sure?"" 
""Yeah I'm sure 
I saw the whore as soon she walked through the door"" 
""Yo, say no more, which one?"" 
""The one in Jersey, son, right over the bridge"" 
""We goin' hurt those hoes"" 
""And hurt both of them kids"" 
Now I'm in the Range 
Switchin lanes, doin a buck 'n change 
I can't wait to touch the lames and them fuckin dames 
Reach the destination, grab the heat without no hesitation 
These niggas fuckin up my reputation 
I saw Coleone holdin the chrome 
Ice-grill, lookin like he had a license to kill 
And he had somebody else with 'em playin the cup 
Lookin like he can't wait to start sprayin shit up 
""Yo, who that in the background?"" 
""It's Tommy Giss"" 
""Oh, I didn't recognise you with your hat down 
Son you ready, we got this whole shit mapped out"" 
""Yeah, wo goin to take the backroute 
And pull our gats out and throw our mask on 
We ain't leavin till everyone's dead and all the cash gone"" 
""We goin to get our laugh on when we're through 
But right now we got a job to do"" 
""So let's do it"" 
Hey yo, I stepped to the deskclerk 
Put the gat to her dress-shirt 
Told her to listen up before she get hurt 
""They just walked in, party of four, two chicks, two males 
What room they got?"" 
She paused and said ""212"" 
Took the steps now I'm out of breath 
I gotta stop smokin 
Them cigarettes goin be the cause of my death 
My heart beatin fast now, cause it's about to pop off 
Saw the door, let the glock off, tore the lock off 
Took a deep breath, then ran inside at a quick pase 
I felt disgraced, I should've shot the bitch in the face 
Then my other two niggas ran in 
Each had a cannon 
Ready to take care, how we done planned it 
""These two crab cats, we know they hustle upstate"" 
We know they got stacks 
Cause they don't move with nothin but weight 
We got the cuffs and the ducktape and put it to use 
Then told 'em when this is over we be lettin 'em loose 
""Hey man, I kicked Mike in his face 
So I just had your back 
You want to live and tell my nigga where the stash at"" 
He gave me the address then I ran outside 
But first I took the keys to his van outside 
And when I got there, I found 50 keys in a stash 
A 100 pound of grass, and 2 million in cash 
I was dumb glad 
The sit didn't fit in one bag 
So I got three, filled 'em all up to the teeth 
And put the bags in the van, then I locked the truck 
When I got back, Coley done popped them punks 
""Hey yo', fuck it L, we might as well pop these studs"" 
Man that's four bodies 
Two outta-towners and two hotties 
And after that we ain't sleep for three days

Stomp down, return smacks, sniffin afro hairy chest
Being, often seen, the Atlantic ocean, scared of motion
Bulletproof flips, I'm slappin 'em, you shoot your best shot

Roll the pearl, all world, lovin Oakland girls
Vinny Testaverde style, I'm tossin balls dirty
All form in swim, telepathic with amphibians
Avenue warlord, I'm at the public sellin fat sacks

Pockets on double, profit will triple
Keep my piece tucked, low-plated nickel
Bullets hit me they tickle, actual Terrordome
Tossed my hall door keeper

Italian, Columbian, Chinese black afro gangster
Authentic ball collector, Euro-Asian afrocentric
Bohemian being, third busted eye seeing
Nada on papi, boil latte in the chrome

Dominican fly girls, with Bobby Jo, rockin escrows

Westside highway callin OJ cabs, doin it my way
People with masks robbin Brinks trucks out in Jersey
Nobody's nervous rockin freestyles, chocolate Hershey
Servin quarters up on the concourse, like James Worthy

Feathers with Stetson, my nickname, George Jetson
Right in the baby doll with treasure under Taft High School
RICO squealed, neck broke, in a twelve D pool
Using the infrareds and waterbeds, chewin Big Red

Out of the strange Diamond District, missin big rings
We doin big things, I'm out of here like Vladamir
Devestation equation, information for the crack patient

Suckers see Flintstone, smokin wheat with Mr. Slate
Action you pack up, in Ziplocks, you bring yo' bag up
Open the first one, rehearsal, I'm bound to hurt you

Bust out yo' briefcase, you and your wife start to freebase
Break our your mansion, I'm on the phone with Charlie Manson
With porno tapes, jerkin hard off to Kristy Canyon
You need to convert a witness, 20 different Bronx murders

Angles trap home arrest, hangin feet up out the window
I strike the National Guard, the helicopter light
Shaggy and Scooby, with Velma Daphne laughin at me

For example  an actor who never snapped out of his role 
So many try to hold me back  in the end  yo I prevail 
Watch for subliminals cause devils in the detail

Catch the story of my life on VH1 Behind The Music 
(Ladies & Gentlemen), The starting line ups at home 
We got four emcees and that's five with DJ Romes

B-boy mission in life is to add creativity to the battle scene 
Got Dilated to detonate mic weapons for mic check fiends 
Yo, Evidence (What's Up?) What's that in your hand, is it a guidance missile? 
(Yes it is) Call up ya man Rokka tell 'em it's time to blow da spot up 
With metaphors, lyrically I slap MC's up with my ten inch 
Pull rhymes right out my chest like Popeye does spinach 
Because my song must stay strong with each bomb that we deploy

Dealing with the villainous tactics of the facists

Vocab like refugees but I call it vocap 
Spit it, ventilate 'em, leave 'em laying on their back

It's mostly snakes handing out contracts 
Trying to see where I at 
Innovations on the Dilated, Lootpack format 
We freak the physics, break emcees on contact 
Madlib don't lack, we'll be waiting for that payback 
You better get hitting, your soul when I drop my compound on contact 
All that played out shit will have you knocked out in the first round 
cause too many frauds walking around

If you're not making ends meet than it's not healthy 
To be representin' like the wealthy 
If you're not knowing that my name is Rokka

Yo, I take control grab the horse by the mane 
I'm that New York type of driver on this L.A. terrain 
Make it rain, when it pours we flood, cover your system 
Intuitive, straight up, avoided you by instinct 
You could take cover, dodge radar detection 
But try to dodge weeded out by natural selection 
It's finally here, the moment of the long awaited 
We represent the West, Lootpack and Dilated

So, better back up 'cause DJ Romes is gonna go off and 
Bringing his Technics turntable style straight out of his coffin 
I'll continue to pull out my menu of styles and bend you 
In half then laugh on behalf of my whole Lootpack staff 
Brothers be like ""I want to hear y'all ish"", at least you've waited 
First heard it hear, negative criticism is mad appreciated 
My direction takes course of a fraudulent, fake endorserer 
Thinking he's a dope rhyme style enforcerer (to the world of hip hop) 
If you don't support, you're amongst those who's gonna get dissed 
And dismissed when we come back with 10 times the force of a

From the first take, pop in your box, the Long Await

Yo it's the Pack with them Triple Optic kids 
While we keep this art real, y'all worry bout your pocket lids

I be all in you like you disrespected space in my lyric zone
I'm like a pit, with a leg in his mouth, I bring it home
Bumpy ripping everything known, block every blow zone
I make you sit your ho ass down, turn off your microphone
Cause after me its un-rippable
I slap you in your mouth, your drinks'll be unsippable
I got miles of styles, you must be out your motherfuckin' brain
To think I'm not the nicest in the game
Disconnected from your mainframe, punched cocked
Twirl your nose up Murray the cop, to the beat down you don't stop
When Fox and Bumpy keep it hot
End the whole beef with just one shot, niggaz I fear not
This piece of steel with the screen on top
Projects uncut chyna white dope
Leave a freeze in a nigga throat
I fight for this like the right to vote
The poison I spit, they'll never be an antecdote
You niggaz thought I put my mic down
Cause the industry's scared cause I put my fight down
Before I do that, I sell it out the trunk and make a mill
Now that's a real rap nigga deal
In 99 I'm droppin niggaz like flies
Fuck flowin, I'm turning niggaz into Jesse Owens
Cock the four pound, keep it going, I'm in your dresser room layin

Where I go, New York goes, keepin New York flows

Your style is played out soft shit like Valure
In red and black living rooms when the system booms
He's a nice little diss to whomever whom
Come against me and I give you one of three picks:
Get shot, get stuck up, get your ass kicked
Bring your whole unit, and I be lyrically gunning em
Cause Freddie Foxxx be the illest thing since Run and em
I be running through you like a Hummer, you don't want none o'
So hot I turn December 25 into summer
I scrutinize niggaz and bring em down to size
My lyrical body slam will leave you paralized
Fuck what you memorize, I take you out of drive
And leave you neutralized and black in both your eyes

I ain't scared to diss a MC, but ask him if he scared to diss me
I bet he won't disagree, he'll probably start sayin his throat
Hurt, his mom's is sick with a bad knee
Or start screamin' he's about dough
He's just a faggot with a whack flow
Don't walk up on me talkin' freestyles and off the top of the dome

I'm on my own time, I write my own rhymes

Buck if I really have to, I really slap you
King of Detroit, who they naming the city after
Scandalous partners whose grammar hammers the hard shit
Into your heart with content, yo, who wanna start with?
Expert, Bad & Evil is coming soon
MC's get stuck, head first back in they mother's womb
This shit is written, in my eyes I'm the illest MC spittin'
Leaving all of you cats shitting kittens
I gotta diss you, my niggas be cocking pistols
Shot and split you, fuck splitting the profits with you
Six percent of y'all niggas is just pretend
Cliques with clits, pussy niggas stink with dicks
Niggas act bully and blast for the fast penny
My auto is fully, plenty of niggas packing semi
Speak darts; yo, you get paid?
Rhyming about it is the sweet part
You can't be street smart with a cheap heart
5'9"", a street nigga with deep feeling
I keep illing, my steez willing to keep killing
Fuck rap! A lot of y'all all is just acts
Trust that, you rhyme all wack on rough tracks
Bust and then we all black when you get bust back at
Fuck that, you get blast at, you get laughed at
And I'ma spit thunder, stick to my guns
Niggas is finished before they gimmicks; one-hit wonders
What? Big balls, that's why when I spit, your clique stalls
I'm a pitbull, I'm just dog, I'm just raw
Split y'all, holler, ""It's on!"", then I diss y'all
All of y'all niggas get pissed on claiming you pissed off

Y'all want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers coming in with their team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin', directing and starring in it

The one man on the planet
That'll drive off of the Grand Canyon
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstandin'
Any man plannin' to battle will get snatched outta his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standin'
I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
Bill Clinton, hit this – and you better inhale!
‘Cause any MC that chooses to go against me
Is getting taking advantage of like Monica Lewinsky
Came home in a frenzy
Pushing a ten speed, screaming to Aunt Peg
With three spokes sticking outta my pant leg
Fuck a headache! Give me a migraine, damn it, I like pain
You should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowing you wack
You act up and I'm throwing you down a flight of steps
Then I'm throwing you back up them
If they don't like the track, fuck 'em! The rap struck 'em
Harder than getting hit by a Mack truck and then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper to trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
I'm sicker than a 2Pac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-falling feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'ma climb the Empire State Building
And get to the last step and still have half left

I watch the way the sun sets
Until the night's inside you
Some days I just don't worry, I let it walk through me
Some days I need to bury the very depths of me
So out here to the east of Eden
I let salvation be
I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be there for me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me
Had to walk with me
I watch the way the crow flies
I know it always seems so easy
But if I see it in a grey sky
Can I be sure about the way it leads me
Some days I just don't worry, I let it walk through me
Some days I call upon the very depths of me
So out here to the east of Eden
I watch your soul run free
I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be before me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me
I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be before me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me
Some days will stay a thousand years
Some pass like the flash of a spark
Who knows where all our days go
Out here we lie together
Outside the thunder gathers
Why care about the weather
It always ends in dark
I looked west in search of freedom and I saw slavery
I looked east in search of answers and I saw misery
Some days I just don't worry, I let it walk through me
Some days I walk into the very depths of me
So out here to the east of Eden
I let my conscience be

I hope you're gonna listen to it at high volume and 
I also hope you're gonna like it a lot as I believe 
We're The Suneatshours, the name tells you all and 
Here we are gonna teach you how to not waste your time and 
We're selling you the recipe to believe that 
We've all our life ahead 
We'll never be kind 
To all of those who don't believe that we can 
And we will be right 
We're always the same 
But we'll never be 
A bored generation without dreams to believe in 
That's alright 
We're alright 
And we'll never demean our eyes 
Down to the floor 
S.E.H. means that you'll never give up 
With your dreams 
And obviously that your soul will never die",Intro
DJ Ruda,"Ok I'm leaning to the left
Flag in my right pockets
Star track fly, unidentified flying objects
Extraterrestrial I'm all about my decimels
Retarded in the booth they say I got a special flow
Sicker than your average you rappers is ass backwards
Gudda speak crack and you niggas is crack addicts
The simple mathematics.
You cut the check and I rake in the green like I'm raking the grass in
Pretty bitches damn near feint when they passing
Call my whip Martin but the first name Aston
Tata head niggas get mashed when I'm spazzin'
Think you fucking with me put your cash in, nah I doubt
I was young and reckless when Pete say he was about it
You niggas is ducks howards, cowards
Kill the competition and shower niggas with flowers
This rap shit is ours
Pop bitch

Uh, uptown back in it
Hollygrove black menace
Black clothes, black tennis
Black semi,
I've never sat in hemi
That would offend me
Try Maybach on Maybach
Bitch I got stacks yeah
Paychecks on paychecks
And I still want payback
And I still don't play that
I kill on asap
And you don't do sh-t but get money all day
Pussy shoes on my bullets now they running your way
YM young mula young money all day
Where the drugs so sweet like honey on yay
Which one of y'all say you want drama I'm honoured
I blitz your ass like a muthafucking lineman
Stack of paychecks with a whole bunch of comma's
Still wear red like an old 49ner
Fuck shittin on ya, dump the whole toilet on ya
Weezy F baby bitch I hotter than Uganda

Mama ain't make me to make homies
She make me to make history
So doing that's my extra-curicular activity
Bulldozer boy and the target is the industry
Two things I love in the World, good head and victory
You ain't doing it big and broke stop kidding me
Your whip ain't up to date and your hoes look like Mr T
This is Misery, no Cathy Bates
Come at me sideways my money slap ya straight
Yeah I'm a big joker so you know I slap you ace

Leave the club with ya girl send her home with an ashy face
Love is a gamble but it's my casino
Pretend that your the loser I hope that she (?)
I hope the game got life insurance
Cause I'm kill it
And all you wack ass rap niggas dying with it
I'm so Harlem eating but so starving
Pockets full of fat like all I do is eat margarine
Millz

Put the flow in the pot
Crank up the notch
Burn the song from a stove top
It's finger licking hot
His pitch flip cause the nigga flop
My shit hit like the pitch was soft
Niggas cotton balled
She dropped drawers cause she poppin off
Her pussy cross guard but I don't stop at all
I smash in the car, like fuck the fucking law
I bet daddy gone, who wanna make it done
The rocky shit that we up on
Shttin on em like hittin the barn
Hey wait they say money talks
Man you don't speak at all
You shop at mini malls

Que harás, me pensarás;

Why morirá.

I'm carrying a picture of us in my blues clues lunch box

Can't you see me ?

I try not to cry

I know you don't like it when I cry
Never wanted me to be sad
I try Daddy but it hurts

Maybe someday I can visit you in heaven ok

There's a lot that I could say
But just hold me now,

Baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms,
I'm findin' it hard to believe

And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven

Now our dreams are comin' true,
Through the good times and the bad,
I'll be standin' there by you

Nobody on the beach.
I feel it in the air,
The summer's out of reach.
Empty lake, empty streets,
The sun goes down alone.
I'm driving by your house
Don't know you're not home.

But I can see you,
Your brown skin shining in the sun.
You got your hair combed back
And your sunglasses on, baby.
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone.

I never will forget those nights.
I wonder if it was a dream.
Remember how you made me crazy,
Remember how I made you scream.
I don't understand what happened to our love.
But, baby, I'm gonna get you back,
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of.

I can see you,

And you're smiling at everyone.

DJ Sammy,"I should run, run away
Take my chance
As long as I could disobey
Your charming lips won't make me stay

I am close, much too close
You could see
My yearning face betrays myself
What foolish game we're about to play

And I try to resist though you're irresistible
I will try, try so hard but you're unpredictable
And I try to resist, and I try

And I try to resist though you're irresistible
I will try, try so hard but you're unpredictable
Yes, I try to resist though you're irresistible
I will try, try so hard but you're unpredictable

As you talk, smile and walk
Enchant my senses
With all your magic innocence
What kind of influence

If I  surrender all to you
Will I be trapped
Like a spider holds his victims tight
Are you playin' the same old game

And I try to resist though you're irresistible
I will try, try so hard but you're unpredictable
Yes, I try to resist though you're irresistible
I will try, try so hard but you're unpredictable

In the name of life
What a thrill
Like a steely knife
It hit my face
See it left without a trace

Life's been short 
In the name of love
Paid my bills
Just to rise above secret hills

There's been awful pain all through this race
I've made it to a peaceful place
I know I will make it again
See my consciousness is bright and clear
I'm standing tall and have no fear at all
See me standing tall and have no fear at all

Take away my pride
I will rise again
Though it seems so hard I know
You will see me again

I will rise again

I'll be back again

All we do crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see
Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
Oh, ho, ho

Now, don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky
It slips away, and all your money won't another minute buy

DJ Sancho,"Verse one:
It was a cold dark night when I saw myself lookin down,
Realizin I was nolonger around,
At first it was a blur to me that I couldn't feel your touch,
And now that I'm gone,baby I miss you so much
From up here, I can see and hear everything
All the prayers and thoughts that run through your mind,
Night after night, time after time, seenin you cry,
But I'm still here in your heart for the rest of your life.
So I want you to go to sleep with a smile on your face
And I want you to know
That I'm in a better place
I know it seems hard to know that I'm not there
But one day we'll be back together baby I swear yea...

You just don't understand the things that I'm going through
Lonely nights holdin my pillow tight, thinking about you...
I see your face everywhere I turn, I can't be without you
You were the only one that I could turn to, and baby boy
I miss you

verse two:
I see you in the livin room reminicin
With my pictures in your hands and your heart just wishin
That I didn't have to go
How can this be so... we had plans for the future and what to do you don't know
Everybody is tellin things will be alright
But the things you wanted in life are now out of sight
Without the one you love
You feel you can't accomplish
What you want to do
Cause it seems so pointless
But what you have to understand is that I'm still here
I will always be nomatter where you go don't have no fear
So wipe those tears off your face and put my pictures away,
If you ever need me, just put your hands together and pray..

You just don't understand the things that I'm going through
Lonely nights holdin my pillow tight, thinking about you...
I see your face everywhere I turn, I can't be without you
You were the only one that I could turn to, and baby boy
I miss you

Every night I pray to you to come back to me
I ask the lord above
If my love is strong enough
I need you back into my life
Cause I can't go on
Can you hear me mi amor
I'm... just missin you

You just don't understand the things that I'm going through
Lonely nights holdin my pillow tight, thinking about you...
I see your face everywhere I turn, I can't be without you
You were the only one that I could turn to, and baby boy
I miss you

you just don't understand the things that I'm going through

We keep it all good in this crack-controlled hood
It ain't too late to set it straight, real players don't hate
Push weight and keep fate and the money that I make I'ma break

Youth or ancient, what's the deal?
Southside it's a new era, knoimsayin?
Put you on your boy's mind, real shit
Know what I'm talkin about?

[DJ Screw - Verse 1]
Nobody seems to understand that my brain ain't stable
They got me out on a ledge, feel like I'm fallin off the edge
It ain't no fable, it's re-ali-ty
Feel like I'll move an your fizzin
they're tryin to tackle me, that's why I keep up the business
So relative or stranger, better keep yo' distance
I can't determine friend from foe so you in danger
Chemical inbalances of the weed and cocaine
But it really don't matter to society
A nigga that got no face an no name
Deservin more, but I'ma move until I ain't got nothin left
An the only thing that's promised to me is more povert and death
'cause there's some niggaz lookin for me an they might be near
And if they kill me don't shed a tear, Remember I'm a heavy here
Even still, gotta keep my eyes on the prize
Although my vision is blurry I'm losing life in a hurry
Even my girlfriend don't understand
Don't want her to witness the wicked
so please find yourself another man... haters feel me

Opposition and proposition is schemin for cash
And if you bitches is scandilous, I get mad at ya
So I alleviate the pressure, don't try to run
I guarantee the slugs'll catch ya (hahahaha)
Oh yea, I keep some problem solvers
I'll pistol-whip my automatic and revolver, check it
An I'm a, ""hello bab-ay"", it's in my nature
This a must it ain't a maybe p.k.
The feds takin pictures and tappin my phones
But if I catch you bitches snitchin best believe me it's on
I analyze an visualize to open fire on bitches
And if I catch you bastards asleep I'm leavin bodies in ditches (huh?)
I'll bet they ask a bastard: ""feel like spendin a long one in a casket?""
check it

Bustin shots from my Rolles, tryin to make your car crash (feel me)

Everybody think I love keepin impulsive pride tappin
But I know they wouldn't give a fuck about me if there wasn't no money in rappin
See I know they want to get rich off of me, understand
Even if I was to die I would still rep talk, they'd still put a mic in my hand
Quit tryin to cover my style of life, pretendin like they from my block
But I survive from willin to live while they depend on war and talk
Before you make your move, check yourself and give 'er in front of me
Even if lyrical strugglin, adjust your ticket 'cause you know how dead your gonna be
There's gon' be a dentist to see
When a nigga be screamin and hollarin ""I'm yo' Godfather""
But I guess it's just the menace in me
Plus, the only nigga that's keepin me from clickin is Herman Fisher
We don't care 'cause to kid us he'll get us a drink and infinite burnin swishers
Why they want to play with my life? they got families, nigga I don't
The only thing between me an them hoes is I'ma keep thuggin they timid ass home
But they mind they own goddamn business, and keep theyself outta mine
Because of a thin line between livin they business and boo-yah!

Introducing from Houston, Slim Thug the Boss
The young Hogg out the North, that be running his mouth
Check my files, the Boss man do it G style
I live it write it, and spit it when I freestyle
I'm what them boys on the corner, pumping bumping
Or any hustler, trying to have something bumping
I keep the G's jumping, throwing up they set
And chicks and tricks in the club, po'ing up Moet
If you rich or broke, we gon ball tonight
From 10's to 24's, we goin' crawl tonight
Shot call tonight, you rolling with the Boss Hoggs
Everything free or V.I.P., with the Outlaws
So tell the bartenders, to put it on my tab
And tell the valet dude, to buck you right by my slab
And get what you can grab, from Grey Goose to Bacardi
I'm inviting the world, to my gangsta party

[Chorus: x8]
This for my gangsta niggas
This for my gangstas (jeah)

[Slim Thug]
I see the Northside thugs, G'd up on the wall
I see the Southside players, showing boys shake ball
I see the Eastside hustlers, pieced up thoed deck
I see the Westside G's, thoeing up they set
Ain't no plex, we all trying to take something home
It's three chicks to one, so no niggaz alone
Bunch of dime pieces in thongs, all on the dance flo'
Ain't no rules we all grown, baby anything go
What happened at the Hogg palace, stays at the palace
I got spots in every hot spot, from L.A. to Dallas
You can't miss me, it's my party you can't diss me
Turn off all your clocks people, let's make history
We gon drank till we faint, smoke till we choke
Dance till we can't baby, ball till you broke
I said drank till you faint, smoke till you choke
Dance till you can't baby, ball till you broke

[Chorus: x8]

All the ballers getting green, get ya hands up (get ya hands up)
All the hustlers riding clean, get ya hands up (get ya hands up)
All the independent women, get ya hands up (get ya hands up)

If you smoke (smoke something)
If you drank (po' something)

DJ Shadow,"Yea, from BK to the world. I've had enough

Now-a-days, the range ain't big enough
Moskino ain't jig enough
I'm kind of iced out
But my chain ain't thick enough
Album ain't hot enough
Label said its not enough, singing in the hook
I need to change my look
My rims ain't big enough, chrome don't shine enough
I shopped Fifth Fab, but I still can't find enough
Iceberg to swerve, don't dress gay enough
No airplay, so I guess I ain't pay enough
Cristale don't floss enough
And I still ain't lost enough
Album barely gold, guess I ain't try enough
Video wasn't fly enough, budget wasn't high enough
And I ain't lie enough, about crack sales and jail
Yall feeling me like braill, well I still got no sales
Must ain't soul enough, 'cause my heart ain't cold enough
Said I was ""Born 2 Roll"", but they said I ain't roll enough
Guess I got to brag more, must don't boast enough
Ain't New York enough, ain't west coast enough
But that's fine 'cause I'm gon' focus on mine
And hoping that two-thousand-nine is enough time
Wrote enough rhymes to be on album number fifty
You'll see how I'm on it, if you hung enough with me
The rap game is a book, and I've read mad chapters
And if you ask me, it ain't enough mad rappers

[Chorus]
Somebody, tell me what the deal is I had enough
Niggaz got to know it's for real

Niggaz only rocking them jewels for you to see
Like Ghostface, nigga dont front for me
Enough is enough, we gon' start calling you bluff
Watching your moves, we gon' be, all in your stuff
Fuck around then come through rocking enough ice
Looking nice in high price, niggaz is nuff shiest
Guess it ain't enough thugs, enough drugs on the streets
And niggaz ain't busting enough slugs
Not enough Caucasians, no one stresses
Project girls rock vesses, not dresses
Enough lessons learned, play with fire burn
Enough dough get made, not of it earned
Enough wildin', fuck that yo, enough smilin'
I rep Brooklyn, Manhattan, Staten Island
Queens plus the BX, not enough teks
Not enough cops, killing us all for paychecks

[Chorus]

Enough if this, enough of that, enough crap
Enough wack radio stations set enough rap
And they got the nerve to try to flaunt it
Will my album get enough buzz if there's enough niggaz on it
When we get in the house, it's like its haunted
We got you shook, mad niggaz from the Brook', look
Enough cats with crack moes and mack hoes
Enough cats with wack flows pack shows
Enough of these, enough of those, it never slows
It just grows, your girl don't wear enough clothes
These no-brainers, are lost entertainers
They found on billboards, greatest sale gainers
Enough beans and Benz, enough fly honies  with dime friends
That want to juice you for you ends
It's getting rough, a whole lot of intricate stuff
Mad crime though, like McGruff, enough's enough

DJ Shadow,"
In the twilight of a time
There emerges a need for man to comprehend his own bitter fate
Finally resigned to the inevitable beyond, he searches the ages
Desperate for stories of assurance, redemption and hope

Such tales fill page upon page with enough ink
To flood a thousand valleys, and drown the tallest tree
But there is one tale that as yet been told
The story of... The Outsider

Desolate and baron, humanities at a crossroads
The people have retreated shuttering their once carefree lives
From unseen enemies which seem to plague not only the physical form
But the innermost thought

Driven by panic, compelled by dread
The masses begin to devolve
Once dear neighbours turn wary foes
Brother against brother, sister against sister

Achievement and ambition are dismissed
As heretical, or worse, treasonous
Even nature itself is scorned
Choked with suspicion and fear
Voices do not dare to sing
Nor fingers to play
Imminent defeat is all but assured

But in the darkest hour
Whispers begin to tell of a figure emerging from the darkness
A being without a name, faceless and obscure
Part presence, part idea they say
As if the very force they describe has existed for eons
A dormant seed awaiting nourishment
Word of radical acts...
Disobedience, non-compliance spread among the people
At first fearful, then defiant, as the legend grows
Whispers turned to cries and the cries into screams
And tend to cower no more the fury of the people
Whose talent behold as they exact revenge on their captors
Spare neither the repentant nor the bold

Now the fire is lit, smouldering in the belly of humanity
It cannot be extinguished, for the stories The Outsider endure
Even as evidence of its presence is debated with the passing years

Messages, dictations, warnings
Stories, such as these...",Outsider (Intro)
DJ Shadow,"In the beginning, well, I didn't know
As time passed on still didn't know, I didn't know

But this time, this time I'm gonna try it my way,
I'm gonna live life my way
This time, this time I'm gonna try it my way,
I'm gonna live life my way

Well, I didn't know, just couldn't see
The memories of past failures like a shadow haunting me

But this time, this time I'm gonna try it my way,
I'm gonna try it my way
Yeah, this time, this time I'm gonna try it my way,
I'm gonna live life my way

There was a dream, I wanted to come true
But dreams you know they need to be followed through

That's why this time, this time I'm gonna try it my way,

I speak from the heart
I fear beginning
I must go
Broken and soaked
To the wider world returning
I'll never be sullen again
Something is wrong
I can't stop my thoughts
I tell myself to stop them

Stop, stop what you're doing
I guess I'd better face it

Even though they are mine
It feels as if it is physical
Like being in a different world
Weirder
As if somehow things just are

Standing in a meadow
Looking out into the sky
And hundreds (and hundreds)
And hundreds (and hundreds)
And hundreds of butterflies

That's all I can remember
(Lift off from around him...)

Dance with light
Send stars to the night

Silent cries
The shadows surround us

So we crawl out from under
The water, out of darkness
(We're almost home, no sleep, no, girl)

Look around, don't stare
Into the light too long
(There's nothing here to see
(Ain't seen nothing)

Frozen hands on the window
Crying out in your sleep

Look away now, look away now
(I never said that you were falling to pieces)
(I know the thought that
(We would never get out of this)

Now the time that falls into the cracks
(There's nothing here to see

So we crawl out from under

Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart

You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

You have found her, now go and get her

I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

[Kaine, (D-Roc)]
Here we come so fuck the whole flow
Ying Yang Twins kicking in your door
Everybody better hit the floor
Give me the weed and out you'll go
Bad kids on a dead-end street
Told Smurf to get the keys to the Jeep
Three niggaz only goddam free
If you fronting, get put to sleep
Infrared beam over your skull
Give me the shit - I won't kill your girl
Fuck that bitch and fuck the world
(Man, what you saying nigga?) fuck the world!
Man, I'm down 'cause it's all in the game
D-Roc and Kaine, that Ying Yang Twins
Then go bring some pain
Nigga gone tilt it down on they brain

[Chorus: Ying Yang Twins (repeat 3x)]
Fuck that one
I got my Nina gun pistol!
Down on they brain

[Verse 2: D-Roc]
I make you want to pop that thing girl when the bass drop
The D-Roc make you want to pop the glock, it don't stop
Smurf be an alcoholic
I love these hoes, thank God for hydraulics (wooo!)
That's the sound of the ghetto
Arrive down here, be darker than the cattle
Oh no, nigga watch your nose
'Cause you'll get hit by hoes that spit flows and prose
Strictly coming niggaz that hoe
A thug that tight is what your boy chose
The niggaz I sell the drugs
The ghetto type hold the world it's for thugs
So all my flows, yeah, your boy loves

When shit hit the fan we fight dirty
And send why'all weak motherfuckers to bed early

[Chorus: Ying Yang Twins]
[Verse 3: Kaine, (D-Roc)]
Nigga fuck it, quit it before you get put on your back with a pistol - down
on your brain
Recognize the Ying Yang Twins (in the game, cocking in)
Ying Yang Inglewood soldiers only cocking in
Fuss or that one on one 'cause I got my pistol
(Ying Yang don't take shit!) we make this motherfucker whistle
D-Roc, Kaine, DJ Smurf, we bring it straight pimping

But don't take it as an open invitation to try
Cuz I'm just hopin' this time that it's all in my mind
I won't find that there's anything to worry 'bout

I want you to be yourself, I love it when I see you having fun
I don't wanna be your shadow, sadness taken away the sun
And you can call me a fool, but I just wanna see my baby smile
I don't wanna kill the mood, I don't care if I'm in denial

It's just a touch, so baby I don't want to know
It's just too much, so baby you don't need to show
It's just a touch, been cool to be friends
So, till we meet next time, till we meet next time

You think I'm cold as ice, I'm just not easy to burn
But don't turn me into someone who'll break down and cry
Let's get this thing on the line, keep it simple somehow
There's no need, for fixing what's not broken now

I want you to be yourself, I love it when I see you having fun
I don't wanna be your shadow, sadness taken away the sun

It's just too much, so baby you don't need to show
It's just a touch, been cool to be friends
So, till we meet next time, till we meet next time

I know jealousy is wrong, but the feeling's too strong
And it takes me too long to believe it's not real
So if it's innocent, don't push me into it
Cuz I can't handle it, if you're only teasing

It's just a touch, so baby I don't want to know
It's just too much, so baby you don't need to show

I say no way, try again another day
I should be happy, not tipping the scales
I just won't lay, letting my life get away

I don't take things as they come, if they bring me down
Life can be cruel, if you're a dreamer
I just wanna have some fun, don't tell me what can't be done

You know you like it but it drives you insane
You know you like it but you're scared of the shame

You know you like it but it drives you insane
Only 'cause you know that you wanna feel the same

Better keep your eye on my every move

Coffee is going cold, it's like time froze
There you go wishing, floating down our wishing well
It's like I'm always causing problems, causing hell
I didn't mean to put you through this, I can tell
We cannot sweep this under the carpet

I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world for us two
With you in the middle

Lying down beside you, what's going through your head
The silence in the air felt like my soul froze
Am I just overthinking feelings I conceal
This gut feeling I'm tryna get off me as well
I hope we find our missing pieces and just chill

DJ Spinbad,"It`s time to dip dive dip
You might break a hip
To the sound that`s legit
I`ve come to make a hit

I usually bust scratches with my man, C.L. Smooth
But, I decided to get wreck on this groove
As I provide the slide
You`re going on a ride
I know the weather`s nice

There`s no need to play the outside
Guess who`s on the flyer
The man of your desire
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth all the honey-dips admire

Beats are rough and rugged
Pete Rock is the creator
Now I`m busting raps while switching cross-faders
Making sure my sound hits from here to Grenada

Honey gave me skins, man, I told her friends I ate her
But, wait up
I save this subject for later
But, it`s time to catch wreck with the creator

I`m addicted like a stoag
Not into vogue
(Yo, Pete, there`s a girl on the phone)
Tell her to hold `cause I`m busy kickin` rhymes to the rhythm

Fortified with soul `cause that`s what I give `em
Honeys form a line form a line `cause I always seem to capure
Beats made of rupture
Rhymes made of rapture

Far from illiterate
Always seem to get a hit
If you try to step to this
Don`t even consider it

Skins when I want `em
But, only when I eat `em
To set the record straight, I`ll be damned if eat `em
Call me Pete Rock

I make the girls flock
And if you want a beat like this, I got them in stock
So, flow with the flow
Because you know I`m good to go

As I proceed to get wreck on your stereo
Not an imitator
Just a crowd motivator
But, it`s time to get wreck with the creator

Now, C.L. Smooth, cut it up like this

Now, I`m`a take a try
And get a piece of the pie
If they give me one sec
To get some wreck

Never filled with anger
A good body banger
If you try to step to this you`ll get hung on my hanger
Before I say good-bye

Suckers gave a good try
But, point blank you just can`t see this
My word is beneficial
Pete Rock is the issue

And I know you know my style is official
I might give a scratch
(Yes, cousin)
Or I might kick a verse

(No question)
Either one, I can`t be seen
Honeys call me tall and lean
And if you want to stick around

I`ll show you what I mean
Not an imitator
Just a crowd motivator
But, it`s time to get wreck with the creator

It`s time to get wreck with the creator

DJ Spinbad,"New York to the heart  but got love for all 
Lie and die in the fire  where I learned to ball 
Uptown is the place where I lay my dome 
On the streets of the Bronx where my fa mi ly roam 
Hoe damn it  we home  Peter got a nine millimeter 
Playa haters can feel the flame from my heater 
I never really liked to play a fool like that 
But I love to succeed and see foes fall flat... 
Splat, like Deja Vu 
And I got another clip that'll daze y'all crew 
I sip Cristal, Dom P, Mo' with pist-al 
Just cause I'm pissy, don't mean you should misdoubt 
Keep em near da fifties and, hundreds all arranged 
Anything less than that, you keep the change 
Not filthy rich, but bitch I'm barely broke 
Blessed with flows that keep you hooked like dope 
Friends call me Gunz, sons call me trife 
'Cause I'm quick to slide off and slide this dick up in your wife 
And that's life, you should learn how to treat her 
I guarantee Peter, knows how to eat her 
And beat her, niggaz in the Bronx call me Lex 
'Cause I push a Lex, and I rock a Rolex 
And I lounge on Lex', and I love sex 
And I wave techs on sets that be tryin to flex 
Like Dex, nigga God rest your soul 
But when you're playin cards for Gunz, it ain't time to fold, ho

New York niggaz got crazy game 

But outta town niggaz is all the same 

Brooklyn niggaz get crazy loot 

That's because when it's beef they ain't scared to shoot 

Harlem niggaz know how to play 

Mack the 600, gettin crazy pay 

Niggaz outta Queens got shit on lock 

Strapped with the glock, runnin up in yo' spot

Right next to the Mercedes, keep the heat cocked 

For these blocks that are shady, you're crazy if you walk around 

Thinking shit's gravy; stop me? Maybe 

I'm livin life lawless, makin big investments 

On them 8-class flawless, and hoes call us 

I'm comfortable like Ri-carro, two quarters of my life 

Walkin roads type narrow, deep thoughts which I abide by 

Puffin high, got my mind's eye, points sharper 

Than an arrow gettin high, keep your eye on the sparrow 

Riches like the pharoahe, bought a new five 

With the snitches for these hoes, trunk full of ammo 

Keep my toast closer than most niggaz keep they own shadow 

And I strap for my foes like a saddle 

I rock stones, other niggaz rock gravel 

Talk shit? Whatever have you, I'm from Soundview 

Bronx most wanted, front get confronted 

Playa, we rollin deep in the one point five hundreds 

Like Big I., red eyed, mad blunted 

You step outside and get blooded have your whole block flooded 

With the Bronx it's a warnin, stormin guns out 

From, Dusk Til Dawn and it's on, no doubt 

Keep a eye on yo' bitch when I'm roamin about 

And put a eye on yo' lip nigga, watch yo' mouth 

I'm from the Bronx, wipe yo' feet when you step in my house

DJ Spinbad,"I came in the door, I said it before
I never let the mic magnatize me no more
But it's biting me, fighting me, inviting me to rhyme
I can't hold it back, I'm looking for the line,
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat
My rhyme will be kicking it until I hit my last note
My mind'll range to find all kinds of ideas
Self-esteem makes it seem like a thought took years to build
But still say a rhyme after the next one
Prepared, never scared, I'll just bless one
And you know that I'm the soloist
So eric b, make 'em clap to this

I don't bug out or chill or be acting ill
No tricks in '86, it's time to build
Eric b easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
Cuz to me, mc means move the crowd
I made it easy to dance to this
But can you detect what's coming next from the flex of the wrist
Saying indeed that I precede cuz my man made a mix
If he bleed he won't need no band-aid to fix
If they can get some around until there's no rhymes left
I hurry up because the cut will make 'em bleed to death
But he's kicking it because it ain't no half stepping
The party is live, the rhyme can't be kept in-
Side, it needs erupting just like a volcano
It ain't the everyday style of the same old rhyme
Because I'm better then the rest of them
Eric b is on the cut and my name is rakim

Go get a girl and get soft and warm,
Don't get excited, you've been invited to a quiet storm
But now it's out of hand cuz you told me you hate me
And then you ask what have I done lately
First you said all you want is love and affection
Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection
Take you out, buy you all kinds of things
I must of got you too hot and burned off your wings
You caught an attitude, you need food to eat up
I'm scheming like I'm dreaming on a couch wit my feet up
You scream I'm lazy, you must be crazy
Thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze me

I'm Rob Base and I came to get down
I'm not internationally known
But I'm known to rock the microphone
Because I get stupid, I mean outrageous
Stay away from me if you're contagious
'Cause I'm the winner, no, I'm not a loser
To be an MC is what I choose-a
Ladies love me, girls adore me
I mean even the ones who never saw me
Like the way that I rhyme at a show
The reason why, man, I don't know
So let's go, 'cause

My name is Rob, I gotta real funky concept
Listen up, 'cause I'm gonna keep you in step

That I wanna share
You don't like it, so what, I don't care
I'm number-one, the uno, I like comp
Bring all the suckers 'cause all them I'll stomp
Bold and black but I won't protect
All of my followers 'cause all I want is respect
I'm not a doctor, put them in rapture
A slick brother that can easy outfox ya
'Cause I'm Rob, the last name Base, yeah
And on the mike, I'm known to be the freshest
So let's start, it shouldn't be too hard
I'm not a sucker so I don't need a bodyguard
I won't fess, wear a bulletproof vest
Don't smoke buddha, can't stand sess, yes

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight

The situation that the Base is in
I'm kinda stingy that's why I don't wanna lend
A funky rhyme to a foe or a good friend
But listen up 'cause I want you to comprehend
'Cause I'm the leader, the man superior
I take care of ya and then ya get wearier
So just sit, my rhymes are not counterfeit
The record sells which makes this one a hit
It won't hurt to listen to Red Alert
Take off your shirt, make sure it don't hit the dirt
I like the kids, the guys, the girls
I want the ducats 'cause this is Rob Base's world
I'm on a mission, ya better just listen
To my rhymes 'cause I'm all about dissin' 'cause

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
Hit it!

I stand alone, don't need anyone
'Cause I'm Rob, just came to have fun
Don't need friends that act like foes
'Cause I'm Rob Base, the one who knows
About things that make ya get weary
Don't cheer me, just hear me
Out 'cause I got the clout, shout (ho!)
Before I turn the party out
I won't stutter, project my voice, speak clearly
So you can be my choice on stage
Or on record, go to the Wiz and select it
Take it off the rack, if it's wack put it back
I like the Whopper, fuck the Big Mac
If you want static, so let's go
So, throw up your hands, go for what you know
Bro', I got an ego
Yo, talkin' to me, no, oh?
'Cause Rob is in the front, EZ Rock is on the backup
We're not soft, so you better just slack up
'Cause I'm cool, calm just like a breeze
Rock the mike with the help of E-Z Rock
On the set, the music plays
Only cuts the records that I say

Bitches call me Horse the pussy filler

Beat that pussy up real quick then send home the bitch
Ain't no sleepin in my bedroom
When henny's in my dick
When Flex drop the bomb I bust a nut on this bitch
Deep throat, Caesar gold or pun wicked hoes
Who like the way I thug and the way I flow
I like head in the Benz, the four door or the Coupe
Head in the staircase, the cellar or the roof
Head in the studio, the bathroom or the booth
Head from a project chick or one with crazy loot
Like Nia Long in a cherry thong with the lights on
Sippin Perignon with Kelly Price on
I pull out my python, I hit it while my wife's gone
Long dick the bitch all night, I'll make her pussy sing the song

The reasons for my life are in a million faces
Like aching promises I feel them in my bones
Slipping through my fingers to dance upon the road
The reasons for my life are more than I can hold
But oh, the sweet delight to sing with all my might
To spark the inner light of wonder burning bright
You're not alone
You're not alone

The reasons for my life are buried in deep places
Words once could awaken them
These seeds that I have sown
Ringing through the madness to crash against the cold
The reasons for my life cannot be bought or sold

The reasons for my life are filling all my spaces
Like rushing waters flow, they carry me along
Twisting through my memory to pull free from the load
The reasons for my life are more than I was told

All my dreams pass before my eyes, a curiosity
Dust in the wind
All they are is dust in the wind

Same old song, just a drop of water in an endless sea
All we do crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see
Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
Oh, ho, ho

Now, don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky
It slips away, and all your money won't another minute buy

DJ Spooky,"We livin' in a mean time and an aggressive time
A painful time, a time where cynicism rots to the vine
In a time where violence blocks the summer shine
Lifetimes, go by in a flash
In search for love, in search for cash
Everybody want to be some fat tycoon
Everybody want to be on a tropic honeymoon
Nobody want to sing a little bit out of tune
Or be the backbone of a rebel platoon
It's too soon to step out of line
You might get laughed at you might get fined
But do you feel me when I say I feel pain everyday
When I see the way my friends gotta slave
And never get ahead of bills they gotta pay
No way no way!
Some make a living doing killing Colombian penicillin
Some are willing to play the villain they just chillin'
To pass the time, pass the information
Or pass the wine
Pass the buck or pass the baton
But you can't pass the police or the pentagon
The I.R.S. or the upper echelon
I think it's time to make a move on the contradiction 

[Chorus]
Bom-Bom, rock the nation
Take over television and radio station

Bom-Bom the truth shall come
Give the corporation some complication! 

This is the dawning of our time I say it one more time
To emphasize the meaning of my rhyme
To rise above all the dirt and grime
Add the right spice at the right time
Fuck the constitution
Are we part of the solution or are we part of the pollution
Sittin' by and wonderin' why,
Things ain't the way we like to find them to be, to be
For you and for me the people over there and the ones in between
Check our habitation are we a peace lovin' nation
Peace lovin' nation
I have a reasonable doubt I think I'll just spell it out
There's no need to scream or to shout
The N.R.A. just bought a man's soul
Then he jumps up and shouts gun control
The government says that killing's a sin
Unless you kill a murderer with a lethal syringe
So I ask again ""are we peace lover's then""
Some of them slang guns when they six years old
Some of them end up in some six foot hole
This whole damn place seems to, lost control
So I raise my voice before I lose my soul

[Chorus]

This is the way I'll express my feelings
Vibe revealed and revolved spinning on a record y'all
Try to confiscate take what I communicate with
It's ancient gift of the lip steady creating
Activating passing vocal vibrations to the blind plus the seeing
Human doesn't mean just being
Be coming don't believe it just belife it
Belongings or beloved rehearse it or recite it
While shining drop your guns and move your tongues
Battle motivation in no time lyrics come
Sometimes fun others run their mouth or away
My mind co beaming like an early sun ray
One day we'll get the picture and all combine
Less the talking bout mines is mine and become one mind
Every piece of the puzzle has its place
To build the piece of the puzzle called the human race 

Taking it long enough we crush the formal journalistic
Dyslexic critters talk backwards to rap words
I'm sure raising my hands with questions and demands
Statements and a plan with a map of the land

DJ Spooky,"Oh no-there's got to be a better way 
Say it again 
There's got to be a better way-yeah 
What is it good for? (war)

Man has a sense for the discovery of beauty
How rich is the world for one who makes you for us to show
Beauty must have power over man, war

After the end of the war I want to devote myself
To my thoughts for five to ten years and to writing them down
War has caused unrest among the younger generation
Induction then destruction, who wants to die?
Wars come and go what remains are only the values of culture

Then of course there is revolutionary love
Love of comrades fighting for the people and love of people
Not an abstract people but people one meets and works with
When Che Guevara taught of love being
At the center of revolutionary endeavor, he meant both

For people like Che or George Jackson or Malcolm X
Love was the prime mover of their struggle
That love cost them their lives, love coupled with a man's pride
Love coupled with a man's pride
Give it to you on top, now

War, I despise 'cause it means destruction of innocent lives
War, means tears to thousands of mothers how
When their sons go off to fight and lose their lives

I said, war, good god, now, what is it good for?
Absolutely, nothing
Say it again, war, what is it good for?
Absolutely, nothing, listen to me
War, it ain't nothing but a heart breaker
War, friend only to the undertaker, war

(War, war, war, war)
War, what is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Say it, war, good god now, what is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, say it, (war)

Oh no, there's got to be a better way
Say it again, there's got to be a better way
Yeah, what is it good for?

DJ Storm,"We got that green stuff, Big Tite
Lil Flip the Leprechaun, Slim Thug the Boss Hogg
Fin to put it all in why'all face

I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass
We got too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

DJ Tatana,"Where have all of our children gone?
Innocent of all, the world that's so bad
It`s no wonder that it's so wrong
When they are alone in truth they aren't that strong

Children, children, expectations great and small
From afar, we see them fall
Children, sweet children, who'll be watching out for you
Who'll be there to guide you through?

Where have all of the children gone?
Thought to be a ware of dangers out there
In the streets and in the schools
In a world so cruel who keeps changing all the rules

Children, children, expectations great and small
From afar, we see them fall
Children, sweet children, who'll be watching out for you
Who'll be there to guide you through?

Where are all of our children now?
Some hungry abused neglected confused
Hey little girl is your mama home
No I'm all alone, these are the words that say it all

Children, children, expectations great and small
From afar, we see them fall
Children, sweet children, who'll be watching out for you
Who'll be there to guide you through?

Children, who'll be watching out for you
Who'll be there to guide you through

DJ Tiësto,"I feel those days so close to me
Pulling me home
When I will hold you so near to me again
I'm coming home.

I feel those days so close to me
Pulling me home
When I will hold you so near to me again
I'm coming home.

DJ Tiësto,"You can see forever
Look inside of your mind
Find a sense another wonder
Just release the fears you left behind

Feel your way through the darkness
Guide your soul into the light
Swim into the open water
Drift on the tides that you may find

Find your soul in the sunrise
Look around you can see it in their eyes
Be as one together
Rise up as the emptiness subsides

You can see forever
Rise up together
Search and you will find the answer
If you look deep inside of your mind",Perception [New Vocal Mix]
DJ Tiësto,"Touch me in the morning
And last thing at night
Keep my body warm baby, you know it feels right
Take it a little higher
I'm thinking it too
Tell me what your feelin'
I'll feel it with you

We can't always understand what we are shown
How was I supposed to know our love would grow
We can't always understand what we are shown
How was I supposed to know our love would grow

Move a little closer
Make sure I'm lookin' up
Heal me with your loving
I need you so much, I need you so much , I need your so muchhh
Yeah
Oh oh

We can't always understand what we are shown
How was I supposed to know our love would grow

We can't always understand what we are shown
How was I supposed to know our love would grow

You touch my mind in special places
My heart races with you
I'll take your love and I'll take my chances
I'll take them with you

Touch me in the morning
And last thing at night
Keep my body warm baby, you know it feels right
Take it a little higher
I'm thinking it too
Tell me what your feelin'
I'll feel it with you
Feel it with you
Feel it with you

We can't always understand what we are shown
How was I supposed to know our love would grow
We can't always understand what we are shown
How was I supposed to know our love would grow

You touch my mind in special places
My heart races with you

Take my mind in special places
My heart races with you

I'll take your love and I'll take my chances
I'll take them with you

I need you so  much",Touch Me
DJ Tiësto,"It's battleship grey outside
And we don't know what we'll be getting
All your sweet talking, raining over me
‘Til my name escapes, and I'm set free

There's a word in your eye,
But I don't know what is to say it
And when you call me from the other side,
A sense of it starts breaking up, and its lies

I don't know, what I'm getting,
But I'm getting something,
I don't know, what I'm getting,
But I'm getting something

It's battleship grey outside,
Confusion, all this is for the gods
Uncertainty, I could be bathing under artificial light
Under twilight blue, starts to mesmorize
And I tell myself that you light up my life
But its all in the mind when you cannot see in the eyes

‘Cause I don't know, what I'm getting
But I'm getting something,
I don't know, what I'm getting
But I'm getting something

It's battleship grey
All your sweet talking, raining over me
‘Til my name escapes, and I'm set free",Battleship Grey
DJ Tiësto,"I wouldn't call it time well spent
Repeating to myself again
Find comfort in an endless stream of moments
I don't even care, about the way I feel today
Because it changes anyway
Something will make me cry or smile
Another picture on my pile

Now I'm standing close to you
It's just something that I do
When I need love to be enough
I wish love could be enough
'Cause there is nothing more appealing
Than the thought that I could be enough

Do you find solace in the sun
Do you consider life as one
Do you believe there is a limit
To how fast a man can run

Someone said you're born alive
Well I don't feel that alive
No I don't feel that alive
I don't feel that alive

Now I' standing close to you
It's just something that I do
When I need love to be enough
I wish love could be enough
'Cause there is nothing more appealing
Than the thought that I could be enough
Enough

I could be enough, whoa",Close to You
