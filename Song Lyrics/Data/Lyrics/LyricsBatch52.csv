Def Leppard,"You got this reputation for calling all the shots
I got your invitation so show me what you got

Are you man enough?

You got me in a cold sweat with a lingering caress
A bullet in your chamber with no return address
If you can keep a secret then we can make a deal
Put your finger on your trigger and show me how you feel

When you’re moving to the music you got voodoo in your hips
And the devil would approve it so the question on my lips

Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
To be mine
To be mine
Be my girl

You got my full attention when you’re movin’ ‘cross the floor
Divine intervention comes a knockin’ on my door
I got no time for talking, just need some company
Let your fingers do the walking all over me

When you’re moving to the music you got voodoo in your eyes
Let the devil try to prove it but the question will arise

Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
To be mine
To be mine
Be my girl

Show me down the river
Show me down the river
Show me down the river
Show me down the river

Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
To be my girl?

Are you man enough? (Are you man enough?)
Are you man enough? (Are you man enough?)
Are you man enough? (Are you man enough?)
To be mine
To be mine be my girl",Man Enough
Def Leppard,"Bow to the man who gets to
Give with what he can
Kneel to the universal mother
Say a prayer for that child
Where no one cares
Give a hand to help your brother
We got need for the greedy
And greed for the needy
We eat to feed on one another
Warmth for the chosen
Only fear the frozen
Sincerity lives undercover

Set adrift on the sea of love
Ride on the breeze
With only heaven above
You'll be sailing the sea of love
Open your mind
Be careful what you find

Hail to the love with only love to discover
A broken heart for consolation
Bread for the winner
Others starve for their dinner
The noble cause is in vain

Set adrift on the sea of love
Ride on the breeze
With only heaven above
You'll be sailing the sea of love
Open your mind
Be careful what you find

Try breaking while your's not beating
Try bleeding when you start to feel
Try crawling while the sky is falling
Try walking while you're standing still

Set adrift on the sea of love
Ride on the breeze
With only heaven above
You'll be sailing the sea of love
Unlock your mind and let your
True love shine

Set adrift on the sea of love
Ride on the breeze
With only heaven above
You'll be sailing the sea of love
Keep yourself alive take your mission to survive
Open your mind believe in what you find",Sea of Love
Def Leppard,"Sometimes I feel I don't belong here
Sometimes I just don't feel
I feel so uninvited
A wound that never heals

I need a little shelter
Just for a little while
Sometimes I have the silence
Behind a driven smile

If you can't see first door
I will roll it away
I will kneel at your throne
Hold my hands up and pray

I will hold back the time
Push the oceans aside
Save the day
But I can't be stronger

You're all that I am
You're all that I see
The keys to the kingdom
Waiting for me

So, don't move it back
Don't hold me down
Just hold me, and don't let go

You're all that I am
You're all that I do
The end of the rainbow is waiting for you

So tell me if I'm right,
'Cause this can't be wrong
Not if we belong

Whatever happened to forgiveness
Are the words too hard to say

What happened to the answers
They disappeared along the way

I hide behind the madness
Still looking for the clues

And there’s nothing left to chance
When there’s nothing left to lose

And the voice in my head
Screams the words I believe
And the light in the dark
Is the air that I breathe

You’re all that I am
You’re all that I see
The keys to the kingdom
Waiting for me
So don’t hold me back
Don’t hold me down
Just hold me and don’t let go
You’re all that I am
You’re all that I do
The end of the rainbow
Is waiting for you
So tell me I’m right
Cause this can’t be wrong
Back where we belong

As you cast the first stone
And I roll it away
And I kneel at your throne
These words that I say

You’re all that I am
You’re all that I see
The keys to the kingdom
Waiting for me
So don’t hold me back
Don’t hold me down
Just hold me and don’t let go
You’re all that I am
You’re all that I do
The end of the rainbow
Is waiting for you
So tell me I’m right
Cause this can’t be wrong
Not if we belong

The keys to the kingdom
Are waiting for me",We Belong
Def Leppard,"Faces on the ceiling
Writing's on the wall
No one to believe in
And nowhere left to fall
The road ahead gets longer
Like a land from outer space
I can't get much stronger
Lost without a trace

Desolation is all I see
Liberation is what I need
Desperation is following me
If only I could feel like I'm gonna be

Touched by the wings of an angel
Touched by the wings of an angel
Gabriel lay your hands on me

And now the voice of reason
Has nothing left to say
There's rebels in the kingdom
As heaven looks away
If only you could hear me
If you could see the darkness fall
But your spirit walks right through me
Like a shadow on my soul

Desolation is all I see
Liberation is what I need
Desperation is following me
If only I could feel like I'm gonna be

Touched by the wings of an angel
Touched by the wings of an angel
Gabriel lay your hands on me

Desolation is all I see
Liberation is what I need
Desperation is following me
Touch me touch me please
Oh I wanna be

Touched by the wings of an angel
Touched by the wings of an angel
Gabriel lay your hands on me

Touched by the wings of an angel
Touched by the wings of an angel
Gabriel lay your hands on me",Wings of an Angel
Def Leppard,"Do you want to get rocked?
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

I'm your average ordinary everyday kid
Happy to do nothin'
In fact that's what I did
I got a million ways to make my day
But daddy don't agree
'Cause when I try to get away
He says he got plans for me
Get your butt right out of bed
Stop buggin' me
Get up and move your sleepy head
Don't shake my tree
(He said mow the lawn) who me?
(Walk the dog) not my style, man
(Take out the trash) no way
(Tidy your room) c'mon get real
Sorry dad, gotta disappear
Let's get the rock out of here

Seven day weekend
Up all night
In at the deep end
Hang on tight
Won't take a minute
It won't take long
So get on in it
Come on, c'mon, c'mon

Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's go all the way
Get it night 'n' day
C'mon let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

I'm your average ordinary everyday dude
Drivin' with my baby
To get her in the mood
She's dialin' through my radio
And I'm ready to make my move
But what she got ain't rock 'n' roll
And it really blew my groove
It was Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven
It makes me want to scream
Bach, Tschaikovsky, violins
Turn it off, that ain't my scene
Well I'm sorry girl
Here's my confession
I suppose a rock's out of the question?

Seven day weekend
Up all night
In at the deep end
Hang on tight
Won't take a minute
It won't take long
So get on in it
Come on, c'mon, c'mon

Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's go all the way
Get it night 'n' day
C'mon let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

All I want to do is
Take a ride into the blue
Every time I want to love you
I get stuck inside my room
Heaven knows I'm sick 'n' tired
Of dancin' with this broom

I feel lucky today
Hey look at that, man
Do you want to get rocked?
Do you want to get rocked?

It won't take you a minute
It won't take that long, yeah
Get on, get with it
Oh, c'mon everybody

Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Get on top baby
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Do you want to, do you want to?
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Get on top of it
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Love to rock your body baby
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's go all the way
Let's do it night 'n' day
Let's get out and play
Rock the night away

On the mic I'm Wizard call me Chris Webber 
Scary wise I'm way past terror 
I make like Jay Z then Roc a Fella 
Rock 'em out the club 
Then buy 'em a bottle of champagne 
From the bar compliments of E Dub 
I be the one to cause the confusion 
Twist your mind to pieces 
Make ya think I'm losin' 
Yeah  niggaz try to provoke me 
But  I'm a tower god 
So, there ain't no hope 
Bitches like dope E 
So, I resume, If they step 
I Buck-a-Shot like I'm Black Moon 
Let me ask you's, y'all Feel That like Erykah 
Control the states and make a Def America 
My styles legit, peep the steez a bit 
It's official, like a licensed .45 pistol 
Word to the Preacher's Wife 
I got the power to annoy ya 
And keep them shiesty folks on point 
I'm the butler, servin' MC's 
Because I love to 
N-O, quote, You're a Customer 

I put you in your right mind and frame 
I de-rail tracks and rappers like Doc designed the train 
All aboard with the Def Squad, if you can hang 
My name be precise range, when I aim, I flame 
Fuck a gun, when I was twelve, I was bustin' 'em 
Young, just want to have fun, like little Just' and 'em 
But, Doc never trusted them hoes, double crossed me 
Foes, I take it to the nigga, started you hustlin' 
Whether it be weed, dope or coke 
My athlete flow make Doc show, soak his toes 
Make niggaz bow down, when I'm drunk off Gold Crown 
Pull out the pound, bust off my ro-ro-ro-round 
Jump out a tree, land on your neck 
From the moment you start pumpin' Redman in your deck 
You be like damn, that's what I ride for 
If I apply more pressure, it'll snow on July fourth 
Son spark the spliff, bark the fifth 
The tracks make acrobats lose their arch and shit 
If you came to brawl, we love to get involved 
My squad lickin' hard for all white people to jawl 

MC's it's the final countdown 
You look tired can you go the round 
If you can, I'll slap your hands and give you credit 
If not, I'll turn around and say forget it 

Yeah, nobody rock harder than this 
Closed jaw, stoned face, mic extremist 
And, I doubt it 
You could kiss my ass and make a love song about it 
'Cause, I'm 'bout it and their livin' without it 
Yeah, wantin' to battle with me, as hard as it gets 
Get niggaz in jail watchin' Soul Train 
Turn off the TV, lyrical vet 
Flippin' twenty-six letters of the alphabet 
You talk shit, you deserve what you get 
I'm heart-throb, leave you dead as a door-knob 
Not a hip-hop cop and not down with the Mobb 
Capable of handlin' multiple responsibilities 
Simultaneously, with communication capabilities 
From high-class to mid-class to low and greedy 
I will instantaneously bust an MC 
The non-forgetter, hit you with the one hitter, quitter 
And make you exercise your shit up, nigga 

These niggaz is ridin' dick like rodeo, their homos 
Who want to toe-to-toe, fuck the studio flow 
Def Squad click, a thug nigga, chug a lot of liquor 
.45 slug sender, half spreader, cash getter 
Represent for the real gangsters and drug dealers 
Know half your little rap and I'm cappin' and slappin' niggaz 
Same niggaz takin' this squad shit for a joke 
Pull the pistol 'bout to smoke, they choke, blood spill at the pope 
Their cowards, gettin' rained on like a shower 
Live form NYC, E, Red keepin' me, Mally G 
Master the ceremonial, off the meat rack 
Call you weak, keep gats, pandemonium 
Phony tough Tony ones, we dip dip die in the place 
House, that was some hardcore rap 
Realer than black, black baseball bats and black gats 
'Bout to black out on all you wack cats

Yeah, yo, Def Squad, Full Cooperation on this one yo, total concentration
Wassup wit these cats out there?, I don't think they figured, son
I don't think they hear you son, ha ha

[Keith Murray]

Now first but not least you will respect Keith, lay a nigga down
Like a doo-rag in some grease, you must be crazy tryin to play me
I been dedicated since King Tut the third baby
Lyrical chemist rhyme minister, diminished you for the benefit
Then continue to kill shit for the fuck of it, I see y'all been writin
Still bitin, still lookin lame, half y'all niggaz still soundin the same
I'm excitin when live on stage, when receiting in lighting, frightening
lightning
Throwin thunder in chain, when i first came, I gave birth to a million MC's
In the game, who should all carry my last name
And I'm Gonna Get You Sucka like Damon Wayans, and fame like Jermaine
Bring pain and novacaine, okay y'all lil monkeys want to play?
My Squadron brings the art of war the correct way (OKAY!)
Chorus 2x

Chorus
I need your full cooperation and total attention
There's a few things I'd like to mention, these rappers out here swear they're
So appealing I, step to your business and hurt your feelings

[Erick Sermon]

Okay, well thinkin it's okay to rhyme that way, you'll be P.O.W., M.I.A.
And I'm seven steps ahead of you, five from eternity
An all that shit you kick just don't concern me, I separate the dead from 
The chump, ask a nigga blunt, ""Yo, how many lumps you want?""
So flavorous you could taste it, so hardcore I wrote this layin on the floor
In the basement, my style ain't no walk in the park, got mainstream MC's
Scared to rhyme after dark, an there Ain't No Half-Steppin
I'm reppin like a nuclear weapon, manifestin the Immaculate Conception
Lyrically I rape an MC like sodomy, add tragedy, to your odessy
For battle reservations call 1-900-SQUAD, frontin on us
Is like frontin on God
Chorus

[Redman]

Now when we take it there, these three niggas in the square
My squad hangs out like fourhundred pounds in braziers
My deathrow allines, bein signed then aligned to electric
So it clear like a chair in Texas, HOT, approach wit extreme caution
No horsin around when my squad abortion a sound
Our crew's like Smokey off sokey, even Little Bo Peep, your style is weak
Guard your Rollie, wit all the ice in it, I snatch the ice out and put a price
out
Cop a Benz, put my mom in it, as long as I'm alive I'mma keep the vibe

Yo, hey yo, I step out the shell like a black pearl
But come to destroy you of all worlds
I eat you inside out like stress
The best, I never lose a rhyme contest
While troublesome black rolls flows
Bleed internal external like a bloody nose
Props grow like crops
Desert boot Clarks wit no socks
Parking space killer stay out my lot
You hear my voice, you see my face, you know my name
I take it out your ass and charge it to the game
I battle with words, go to war with ideas
You defeat me never in a million years
The factor of the rapture
Is that you either get killed, wound, or captured
They shoot you up so bad til the end you fought
But then you got caught up in my final thought

Give you static like your mixer got the ground out
Hug you wit my hands in your grandmas pouch
I'm down south wit Outkast wit pounds out
Wicked enough to throw the gun in James Bond mouth
You know E and Keith when we brawl
I be in more hoods than that big fork and spoon on your kitchen wall
And overall, on y'all a protocal
My style is Kabal, finish him

When I stomp I leave the shoe size of Sasquatch

From the start or was it something you wanted to do fucker
I dig a hole so deep you can't return
And hear about the episode on Howard Stern
I'm born wit heart I blast ya
Hit ya wit the fishing deep water and take your yacht master
Playing me one time that's unforgivin
I got a body one count and we ain't bullshittin

You know this the kind of shit, I know you want
E made the beat let me show you somethin' 
Quite a few haters want to see us played out
 
But we got the formula to get payed now 
You can't stand in the way of success 
We got the same job but you make much less 
I remember how it used to be, before we had crack 
If you had a few hundred in your pocket that was fat

[Chorus]
If you feel like smokin' then ride wit us 
Hop the train with no token then ride wit us 
And if you don't give a fuck then ride wit us 
Roll down your windows and ride wit us 
And if you got five on it then ride wit us 
And if you ain't fake niggas then ride wit us 
And if your crew pull trigges then ride wit us 
Roll up your windows and ride wit us 

Ah-yo, I lick two shots that's heard all around the world 
Check how a forty and a blunt can take a nigga girl 
Like E.F. hunting, don't say nothin', I'm haunting 
On the microphone, its the eve of destruction
 
As the world goes around like Passion 
You get flattened in an orderly fashion 
You was warned like a coming attraction 
I got playa hated, felt liberated 
Put him on the burner cause the nigga violated 

We scamper like guard dogs through the fog 
If you feel like you wanna hop, leap like a frog 
The sergeant general get busy chief 
The fastest way to spell rhyme relief is Keith 

I leave you assed out like a cocaine drought 
Hey yo can I get a witness like Andre Krouch 
Niggas need to stop frontin' 
Bitches need to stop stuntin' 
Cause they know fuck well they can't stop my production 

[Chorus] 

I got the forty acres without the fuckin' mule 
Doc Ike Turner givin' mics audio abuse 
I smack a big mouth bitch, and her babysitter 
And her lesbian friend, and that nigga wit her
 
I don't give a fuck, I smack blood out a midget 
My tactics make evil D say come on kick it 
A black five wit rims, what you can spot me in 
Wanna die, I snatch you like Doc Kevorkian
 
So turn the beat up 
While NARCs got me on sweep up 
I'm lucky, I usually tote more Guns than Peter 
I fuck you up to where your forehead will cut meat up 
You wanna box, I square more than Matt Asenerina 
Backstabbing bitches and niggas eat a dick 
Cause you never heard the Doc do (nothin' like this) 
Backstabbing bitches and niggas eat a dick

Rockin', diamond and G with the rooftop cut
I'ma grown man, don't got no time for games 'n stuff
I got balls that'll beat ya ollets 21 rough
Look at my face, Doc's the name, don't forget it
I makes ya make ya scream: ""BOW!""
Like my name's Willie, I get sick with it
Re-dig with it, I had a nine inch slug up
Before yo' stink bitch bit it, I betta clippin' crap
That ya'll cats is black, a prays if the eight jacks
So send neck through facts, reservoir (---) go ball when I was four
Explore whores, when rock came to the door
You never seen before, life to your hood
My steady shows leave niggaz faxs like Rosewood
When I drop the filth weather, bigga built
Our dog fucked the shit outta bitch, of Tiger Mill

You drinkin', I'm drinkin'
You smokin', I'm smokin'

You fucked up, we fucked up

You hate me, I hate you
You talk shit, I talk shit

In a flash I be the E, cat 'n mouse and cash
Not many ballin' niggaz out there, can touch my style!
Or touch the S-class, the 5-00 sittin' on parrellies, chrome
The big 2-0, catch the pitcher, my whole rap steez is deep
For all ya fake dues, I'm the only show that peeps
Last week I was uptown, playin' the streets
 ????????1-5-fifth and get...BUDDAH
That's when I do, when I roll dolo, I call her bitch
There was a time if I ain't doin' that, I ain't doin' shit
I might go to the studio and make a hit
I call my baby's moms, an hear her talk shit
I scoop, I ain't get my kids, niggaz please
We hit Toys 'are Rus and then Micky D's
And go to a movie, the end (of) the day, and talk to 'em
And take 'em back around away, and that's REAL!

Well it's the sly Gemini, me and potatoe cuttin' drops
Have the guy, wellknown but still just gettin' by
And I verify mathematics don't lie nigga
Put in some work, and get a piece of the pie
It be the niggaz that don't immediate pertain to the situation
That be tryin' to come up off the chips, and niggaz makin'
And always worried if I'ma diss you, you insecure bitch
To the government, stay out my shit!
Niggaz was glad when I came with the keys to the chains
To the cellblock to the stage, now it's time to rock
I return like I never left, D-E-F, got the whole world gaspin' for breath
We got these hoes spread it out like mustard

No, no no noo","You Do, I Do"

We're two young
Ragga's that are way too bold
No one holds up back

and strive for it all
Looking forward
never back even if we fall
Taking one big chance

The meaning in the words
can make the world shine
Coming out of soul
it's holly divine
Intertwine thoughts with
emotion so hot
It stops opposition with
pants down caught
Hard as rock, be strong,
lift up your head, belong
To the society of life,
live up, live long
Do you belong, be free,
open your mind and see
There is more to life

Hundred and ninety, nigga known to get lively
Plus put in work ""Between the Sheets"" like Ron Isley
At the bar, Herut the Cognac star
Ice Courvoisier, brothers crowd around like seminars
I'm smooth and ready like Telly Savales
Likwit Crew, nuff respect to why'all niggaz, we swiggy ballers

[Chorus]

[Verse 3}
I want to fly the world, like ?
flies, to Is-rael, and like Ishmael Valdez
I pitch heat, lyrically
Over rugged beats under the ground, from the mainstream
See where I dwells, it's all about skills
This MC walk the walk when he talk, plus get on the wheels
And freak new release with 1200 Technics
Every week, got a hall of fame game, like Dominique
Wilkins, yo Evidence we sound killin'
Many rippertons word to etchin lab on my building
Yo X, yo spouse a raw deal nigga
Barbershop flex, time to collect figures
Yo (Likwit Crew) me and you
we like the treble and bass, straight cousins, here to shake the state
Almighty ?, whom of Allah blesses me upon
We straight keep keep keep it on

Verse 1: 

Six million is what it cost them 

To put back together that cat Steve Austin 

Now Defari gets Bionic 

Over 6 million tracks with 10 million topics 

I'm fiber optic crystal clear with my projection 

Wack MCs get cloths lined when they walk across my intersection 

They need protection 

Some guidance some right direction 

A job center with with an application for a new profession 

Never settle for nothing' less 

I blaze contests 

And set shops for pay days 

In strange ways life twists and turn 

Word to Gangstarr in this business skrilla Hard To Earn 

I format attack new knack technique 

Speak with a passion on wax and tape and CD 

Mad niggas front for paper 

And switch like a bitch in and out like a cross fader 

All I know is how to rock shit

Full court measure for measure 

I'm like Piteno a game plan Gambino 

Where every verse starts with defense first like a casino 

Every minute every hour I use brain power 

For Mr. Space Shuttle Challenger I devour 

A Tower like Eiffel 

Bust off verses like rifles 

Bust all bullets through flesh unless you're wearing a vest 

And even then I still enter

Defari,"Now this is a story in fundamentals
Pure fundamental principles
And all my ????? know what I'm talkin about, knowmsayin?
But yo, it happened like this all the time at the past, no doubt about that
A 1969 vintage bottle of red wine in my hand
Who is that by the checkstand?
With the tall brown tan I call a caramel
The closer I get, the distinctive scent of Chanel
Yo, she was fine, but this happens all the time
L.A.'s notorious for havin top notch dimes
But this one here was a stallion
She looked half sister to me but said she was Italian
Via Puerto Rico
She said that she didn't know pops and that moms lived on Pico
And Fairfax, word to Mix-A-Lot, she had backs
Open off Defari the moment she heard the Goldy Mack
Her name was Cecilia
You know I had to ask her about that wedding ring on her finger
She said that she was separated
That's all I needed to hear cause for a moment there I hesitated
I hooked it up for that night a little later
Flex ???? put my groceries in the refrigerator
Turned on my TV to channel 2
_60 Minutes_ was on, you know the CBS news
Popped a brew, sat down for a minute
Caught this story 'bout this mafia boss known for killin kids
And gettin his, known for smugglin guns
The next thing they show was wedding pictures of his only son
Spit out my brew cause guess who I see?
Right on the TV it's that broad I met at checkstand 3
She's pagin me, let me think quick
Let 10 minutes fly by, called her back and fronted like I'm sick
She leaves messages I never return
I'm not one for the trick bag, too smart to get burned
So anyway, I sees her the other day
She says, ""I know I lied but I'm feelin like Marvin Gaye
I need some 'sexual healing', I'm really hot""
She grabbed my dick, I pressed my luck, fucked, then I shook the spot
Aiyo, the moral of the story is this:
What was I supposed to do, the bitch grabbed my dick
Aiyo, the moral of the story is this:
Yo, what was I supposed to do (the bitch grabbed my) (grabbed my)",Checkstand 3
Defari,"Sleep on the champ  man you better read the scouting report 
You doubtin' this so I connect wit Mr. Alchemist 
The Soul Assassin straight blastin'  bringin' heat

You're not competitive  you're more like a sedative 
You put me to sleep wit each line  are you the bedtime kid? 
Yet in still  I remain crisp like newly printed bills 
And watch for those money-hungry Anita Hill's 
Lyrics are effortless, no matter how stormy the weather gets 
Those who know me like Kobe say ""he's proliferate"" 
The gifted kid, focused like triangular pushups 
Why you claim to be hard when you a buttercup? 
I fuck shit up, stutter step wit action packed mag 
Don't pull no crap just hit the track like a fullback 
Lead block, don't mistake this for no pop-rap, pop 
But that raw deal feel, that real hip-hop

Watch my blind side, catch a elbow to the dentures 
Never drop dimes, I'd rather save expenses 
Evidence, I'm the intense, pressure makes key decisions 
This track hits like Sonny Liston for the Alchemist 
Will someone give me an award, illest vocalist 
I'll come wack when LL loses the hat 
Better yet, catch me wit Feds when Jordan grows dreds 
I own scissors for clones, kill mics and mega-phones 
Loud, be me or beat King Shamiq, and do it to the crowd 
I throw bucks under Daly like Chuck 
Always focused, Evidence yo here's a notice 
Of eviction, time to leave the premises

So many niggas claim that they focused, but that's a fuckin' bluff

The goal is to remedy the world of these wack MCs 

Exactly, Defari lyrical athlete 

Find me in the final heat of the Olympic track meet

This kid he's not the average 

I'm on the rise son like my name was Backstage Laminate 

I got a cabinet of members all who posses spectacular vernacular 

Blazing through contenders 

I remember when hip hop was genuine 

When gimmicks were limited 

MCs were magnificent 

Shows were omnipotent 

The crowd was all feelin' it 

If a kid had skills on stage yo he'd reveal it 

But nowadays mad MCs need lessons in stage presence 

Instead of claimin' they represent 

While I enterprise, maintain, stay awake and wise 

What you hear is what you get 

No lies no disguise

I like the milk I like the lactate 

I like the milk type cords over a phat ass drum break 

With skill my mind spins like windmills 

For MC creeps I got noun and verb fills and brain pills 

I combine dentistry with crainiology 

Stacks of facts not mythology 

So when I catch wreck to enterprise the land of the sunset 

How much run should one don get? 

I say plenty 

That's word to Penny Hardaway 

Hip hop is an arena and every show is like game day 

On Sunday or Monday 

Whatever day I play at a professional level 

Here, in L.A. 

And that's a raw fact no fiction in this guy

See I'm that kid that you know that you never even heard about 

Defari Heru will soon spread by word of mouth 

Through every ghetto street, backstreet and phat jeep 

I enterprise the west combine with strength plus finesse (Now how we go?) 

I 'm blessed by Allah Almighty 

Teaching class daily plus I'm writtin' rhymes nightly 

Mad MCs be lyin' everyday 

They be them same kids who drink pop off instead of Bombay 

Saffire

Retire or get sliced by this lyrical barb wire

Franklins are my favorite bills 
No hands  my favorite type of windmills 
Only now and then do I drink champagne 
Like I said in Big Up I strictly fucks wit Covasea 
You glamorous rappers are too sweet 
Wit your rececycled beats and your styles that put me to sleep 
I'd rather listen to some Brant Green 
Authentic, not like you, got real meaning 
I'm like the low-ridas, I like the oldies 
You know songs, like Agony and Ecstacy by Smokey 
You's a phony, I heard your single 
Corny, like a thirty-second jingle 
Here comes the master of paragraphs on phonographs 
Every letter, etched and sketched like an ancient tag 
You know my heiroglyph, I got a higher gift 
You's a passenger tryin but never be a pilot

I just keep it on the rise, and give you what you want

Here, don't fear peep this 
Step inside my mentals, bare witness to a lyricist 
Skilled technician, rhythmous technique 
Advanced speak, I put mics in condition 
The streets always like hard beats 
That shit that make you move your neck when you're in car seats 
My star fleet, Likwit family 
You Sorry, like that game from Milton-Bradley 
Bound by honor, rollin mad bags of skama 
I've never been the one for the Jerry Springer drama 
Not an actor, just the greastest multiple factor 
This rap game's like a computer, and I'm a hacker 
Linebacker, wit hits that hit like LT 
Watch the blitz, you'll get a Joe Theisman injury 
What's all the glitter gear, meanwhile I wear and tear 
For fanfare, while you rock eye liner and mascare 

Chorus 4x 

[Defari] 
(See what you need) 
When it comes to real lyrics I know you can't hang 
Word to Tash, I'm from Killa Cali where niggas gangbang 
Plus slang more than words, nouns and verbs 
But pure crystal lah, lah meazy herbs 
You couldn't enter the saloon where brothas despise bafoons 
You're funny-style, this ain't no cartoon 
This is Hard Earned dues, word to Guru and Premier 
I'm more than ten years deep, but now it's my year 
""Aiyyo enough's enough"" 
Aiyyo Herut's been long overdue 
But instead these labels and fans have been fuckin wit the likes of you 
Yo don't mistake them, I'm not no hater 
Just a truth-sayer, serve when Vega woofer shaker 
A plees blower, live show flower 
Wit lyrics that'll blaze a whole crowd like a flame thrower

",Keep It on the Rise
Defari,"A different caliber of MC
This track is filthy, word to o.j., you make me feel guilty
Of first degree sound boy murder
Unlike anything out of l.a. you ever heard of
Word up, you play with fire, you'll get burned up
Best believe that my shit sound the best, when it's turned up
Loud, mashing down the block suburban style
Eighteen speakers plus kit chromed out
Yo, you think that you fucking pro?
On the low the other night I caught your wack-ass stage show
Oh, boy, you're just a bore
But you tell everybody that you're like busta
And you got ""rhymes galore""
Ain't that something?
Got the nerve to call yourself an MC, man you be fronting
I don't apologize, oh yeah, and uh
Go back to school, learn some concepts and grammar
Of yourself, get a hold
Next time you on stage, use primatine for some breath control
(ha ha ha) but now don't let asthma be the excuse
You was definitely doper, when no one knew you

[Chorus: x2]
I'm on a killing spree, murder sound boy constantly
Constantly murder wack MC
I'm on a killing spree, skill level at maximum
Dem pussy-clat boy nah wanna see me

You was stone cold lying by the full wack rhyme writing
If I had some gasoline I'd ignite it, with my lighter,
Boom! you combust, cause you disgust me
Wacker than them flat-ass crackers on three's company
You walk around, mad cause no one's feeling you
Mad at me, cause all your peoples they know my lyrics too
They sing along cause my song bumps
On the mix tapes that you made, yet and still you try to player hate
(What?) you're featherweight, weaker than a paper plate
Lyrically, when compared to me, I know your style is fake
Fraud, manufactures, cheaper than Hyundai
Now you're hardcore you probably used to be a true nerd guy
Make up your mind guy, now you're the Mr. get high guy
If you ever step to me you'll think french because you're fucking fried
In the mix of my verbal assault fighting sticks
You shouldn't gamble cause round for round you can't handle this

[Chorus]

Cat was out of pocket, got socked in his jaw
Fell to the floor, that's all she wrote
But I wrote rhymes, that burn every time
On mad mix shows I got wreck off the mind
But what's in a rhyme, if it don't sound tight?
You ask me if a lot of rappers are wack man you damn right
Who's to say these brothers from l.a.
Will take charge like debarge and shine, in a special way?
I say okay, let's get paid
Let's put this money on Putnam and sip Bombays with dis lemonade
Use, Gatorade to refuel
Electrolytes after I ignite this mic too
Yo what's my name? defari herut
By the way since you been asking all these questions
Who the hell are you?
I seen your kind before, no lie
A devil spy, disguised as an ambassador
You can't fool the divine sun rule
Word to blue magic, step right up, and see the like with crew
Hurry hurry, get your tickets, stand in line
After the show it's at the towers on sunset and vine
Me and my niggas at the bar sipping henny
Got your bitch open all night, as if her name was denny's

Cause without them, there'd be no us, that's real
There's something on my mind.. everyday, all the time
It's the legacy, why'know? generations, of black people
Now bust this...
Aiyyo i think about this government, three strikes capital punishment
Enslaved my peoples for four hun-d-red
Yeah, plus some
Often dream of goin' back in time and givin' slaves guns {*buk!*}
So they can watch the master run

Watch them devil try to get away then clap his back with the shotgun
I got one, let's cut his head off
Let's take it to Harriet Tubman, show her that we ready to set it off
She get Nat turner, Nat go get Sojourner
Sojourner send a messenger for Touissant l'overture
Through the underground railroad, we go
Through the dark to the edge of forest to meet with Denmark
Vessey, you know he got soldiers ready
Ready to kill like lions, in the Serengeti
So like a stampede we rush the plantation
Settin' fire to everything, burn them down like cremation
No hesitation, free up the black nation
Kill them devils take his ships and head back for the mainland
The game plan, yet and still it's just a dream
I never forget, in my mind it never leave, aiyyo

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I never forget, in my mind it never leave
These dreams, filled with days of slavery
Never forget, in my mind it never leave
These dreams, filled with days of slavery
Aiyyo, aiyyo Jamie was a slave
Every baby she'd have the master would take away
She never seen one long enough to give a name
Everytime the master would rape, Jamie'd feel ashamed
She was only fourteen
Violated, used and abused, far from a queen
I met Jamie in a dream
I gave her a brand new M-16 with two magazines
I told her next time he come around
Act like you want him, get him to lay down
Make sure that he take off his clothing
After that i want you to fill him up, full of bullet holes
Release the whole clip, set trip on that motherfucker
Tell him that's for disrespectin' you and your mother
Your grandmother, your great-grandmother
Your brother your father, in the land they call the mother
Next thing you do is round up all the rest
Stay together and shoot your way to freedom, god bless, aiyyo

[Chorus: ]

Aiyyo, I got Dj Babu in the house
From the world famous, beat junkies
Aiyyo, yo Babs how you feel about this?
And this goes out to all the ancestors
Especially to my grandmother (??)
The foundation, rest in peace
Love you grandma",These Dreams

And you only sleep when you've lost cause
Well I still believe that the cause was always me.

You make so proud!

And the good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch breaks

Back to the phone company, the record stores, too

Billy likes to peal the labels from his bottles of bud
He shreds them on the bar then he lights up every match
In an over-sized pack letting each one burn
Down to his thick fingers before blowing and
Cursing them out, he's watching
The bottles of bud as they spin on the floor

And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously, close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads 

But,

[Chorus]

Otherwise the bar is ours, the day and the night
And the car wash, too, the matches and the
Buds, and the clean and dirty cars,
The sun and the moon , 

But, all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun

Ich pflück am Zigarettenstrauch

Zieh durch's Land und mach Krawall

Sie wollen nicht länger konsumieren
Sie schmeißen all die Leckereien
Direkt in eure Fresse rein!
Sie reißen jetzt die Schnauze auf
Widerstand wird aufgebaut
Sie klettern auf den Käseberg
Und rufen auf zur Gegenwehr!

23 Dohlen
Fliegen durch die Nacht
Du wirkst ganz durcheinander
Was ham sie bloß gemacht?
Du blickst zum dunklen Himmel
Und siehst die Schwärme ziehen
Die dich nicht nur beherrschen
Sondern noch fernbedienen

Ein leichter Schritt nach vorn
Fällt dir schon sehr, sehr schwer
Du siehst nur noch in dir
Ein verschwommenes Bildermeer
Durch die 23 Dohlen
Siehst du die Welt ganz verschoben
Mach dich schnell davon
Denn die Bedrohung kommt von oben

Alle Vögel sind schon da
Sie fliegen hoch ganz hoch
Alle Vögel sind schon da
Es sind nur 23 Dohlen
Doch du witterst Gefahr

23 Dohlen
Böse und gerecht
Durch sie wird von Wabo
Das Gesetz vollstreckt
Schatten der Umgebung
Stellen dir nun nach
Du kannst sie nicht erkennen
Wird es je wieder Tag?

Nebel, Wölfe, Würmer
Alles ist die Wabe
Du trägst nun deine Träume
Mit ihnen zu Grabe
Vielleicht geht es dann weiter
Vielleicht aber auch nicht
Zumindest siehst du einmal
Dein eigenes Gesicht

Alle Vögel sind schon da
Sie fliegen hoch ganz hoch
Alle Vögel sind schon da
Es sind nur ein paar Vögel
Doch du denkst an die Zahl

23 Dohlen
Fliegen ganz weit hoch
Sie spähen auf den Boden
Und warten auf deinen Tod
Sie tun nur ganz friedlich
Auf dem Hochspannungsmast
Das Gift in ihren Blicken
Nimmt dir jegliche Kraft

Oh, du fühlst dich unwohl
Woran liegt das bloß
Der Kopf wiegt schwer
Und, oh, der Schmerz ist groß
Sie tun dir nichts böses
Doch die Angst ist sehr präsent
Da läufst du schnell nach Hause
Weil du nichts anderes kennst

Alle Vögel sind schon da
Sie fliegen hoch ganz hoch

Fear him, fear him, fear him... Satan

Nazarene in the valley of persuasion
To receive last temptations from Lord Satan
""Take a bite"" said the serpent ""eat of it""
Without no choice to do so, you cannot resist

Impaled crucifixion
Compassion forgot
Eternal damnation
Once upon a cross

Blasphemy laughs at thee
Jesus you've been deceived
Struggling on the cross
Gagging to breathe
Despite your god, question why
You were retrieved by the angel of light

Kill him, kill him, kill him... Satan

Nazarene screaming on his crucifixion
Prophecy in its final contradiction
When you die is when the lie will be believed
Upon the cross, before the world to see

Once upon the cross",Once Upon the Cross [DVD]
Deicide,"Free of their god, intelligence won
Go with your instinct to live as you want
No longer begging for mercy from thieves
They can't come near you, through them you can see
Keep to the outside the teachings of Christ
Denounce the father, undo his disguise
Die, serpents of the light

You are at one, the serpent now gone
Harness the power to refuse the son
Under the bible inherit deceit
Above it enlighten to what you can be
Savor the pleasure once known in your life
Heaven's compassion you know is a lie
Serpents of the light

Serpents of the light, return to where you hide
Give us peace of mind!!
Serpents of the light, revolting parasite
Thorns in paradise!!
Serpents of the light, expelled from human life
Free of Jesus Christ!!",Serpents of the Light [DVD]
Deicide,"In the creation of Anu were spawned
Born of the Earth before they're known
Evade destruction in their world below
Their hands reach for our place outside
Bestow their suffering on human life
Nothing will stop them from re-entering
Return to hatred in the heart of man

They are the children of the underworld
Before the heavens they were on the Earth
To desolation and were never heard
""Cry rebirth""
Lords of the plague, seven are they
Born in the mountain of Mashu's magic
Spirits of hate, they have no name
Withered and wicked, the liars in wait

In the creation of Anu were spawned
With deadly vengeance from the ancient gods
Their place on Earth, their race unknown
Beyond the knowledge of the elder ones
Provoking with our blood to rise
The seven offspring for the sacrifice
Reclaim the power of the crown of death
Enter the body from the temple dead",They Are the Children of the Underworld [DVD]
Deicide,"Open the door Jehovah you whore
I am the servant of who rules this world
Archnemesis of your light
One look at me and you know he is I

Run away when confronted with Satan
Always here and forever will be
Your concern for my Lord is becoming
Defecate on your book of belief

Door to door soliciting war
Feeble man with salvation as sword
Disturb and see you will die
For I am of Him in his world you're confined

Why try? World dies, christ hides
When Satan rules his world
Disease, run free, killing
When Satan rules his world
Religion, infliction, obscene
When Satan rules his world
Witness, dismissed, executed
When Satan rules his world",When Satan Rules His World [DVD]
Deicide,"A day of death upon the cross of deceit
Impure with pleasure to bare witness to he
Death calling you to Christ, human sacrifice, conviction
Down the unseen, your belief, absent god, don't exist
Go unto thou, from the dead, walk with him, he ain't there
Love in retreat, uncompelled, feel no pain, pray unfelt
Hate run in place, holy grace, contemplate, there's no god
The work of Jesus was the devil in fact
His miracles were nothing more than a trap
Lies pinned upon the cross, crucify his false religion
Conviction, choking on the crucifix in his blood
Conviction, take the bullet for the love of a son

Conviction, from the cross into his kingdom you go
Conviction, no more bullshit from the likes of the lord

Satanic visions bring the lord to his death
Their own disenchantment of perversions confessed
Caught, harrow in disgust, revel in your lost religion
Conviction, choking on the crucifix in his blood
Conviction, take the bullet for the love of a son
Conviction, from the cross into his kingdom you go
Conviction, no more bullshit from the likes of the lord",Conviction

Und ich weiß nicht, wie das geht 
Manchmal kann der Tag gemein sein
Ohne dass man was erlebt 
Manchmal will ich einfach klein sein
Und ich weiß nicht, wie das geht 
Manchmal kann der Tag gemein sein
Meine Eltern möchten, dass ich mal Karriere mach´ 
Deswegen soll ich tausend Sachen machen, jeden Tag 
Ich soll die Dinge lernen, um die es geht im Leben 
Deswegen muss ich Schach spielen und Chinesisch reden

Wozu ich Lust hab? Tut mir leid, mir fällt nix ein
Denn ich muss gerade wieder irgendwo der Beste sein 
Und wie es aussieht, wird sich das nie wieder ändern 
Andere haben Spaß, ich hab einen Terminkalender

Sie scheuchen mich, erst dorthin, dann hierhin
Und alles nur, weil ich angeblich so talentiert bin 
Und das muss ich euch jetzt jeden Tag beweisen 
Und aufzählen, wie irgendwelche Nebenflüsse heißen

Mein alter Spielplatz, du warst so farbenfroh 
Keine Zeit mehr für dich, der Ernst des Lebens wartet schon 
Dabei will ich doch nur eine Runde auf dir hocken 
Und später dann nach Hause kommen mit schmutzigen Klamotten

Ich bin zu jung, um zu erkennen, das Leben ist kein Spiel 
Denn wenn ich ehrlich bin, auf Spielen hab´ ich Bock
Und ich meine nicht Memory, heute reicht mir schon ein Stock

Doch ich werd´ beobachtet von stocklosen Augen
Die nicht mit mir fühlen, weil sie nicht an Stock glauben 
Deswegen soll ich mich um wichtige Dinge kümmern
Richtige Dinge kümmern, nicht die im Kinderzimmer

Ja, was ich brauch´ sind vernünftige Ziele 
Deshalb trainier´ ich jetzt für die Olympischen Spiele 
Weil meine Eltern mehr von mir erwarten als von sich, 
Hoff´ ich, dass ich überall eine goldene Medaille krieg

Denn nur dann bin ich ein echtes Goldkind 
Ich mach´ alles, damit meine Eltern stolz sind 
Nur zu den Miss-Wahlen zu gehen, fällt mir häufig noch schwer
Aber Mama kommt ja mit und sie freut sich so sehr

In zwei Sekunden vom Dachboden in den Keller
Danach ins Treppenhaus durch die Tür und nach draußen
Einmal Luft holen und direkt weiterlaufen
Der Donner ist egal ich bin schnell wie der Blitz
Und komm` immer irgendwo um eine Ecke geflitzt
Deswegen kommt es selten vor dass ich mich mal verspäte
Vati nennt mich Sohn Freunde nenn´ mich ""Die Rakete""
Ich rede nicht ich lauf fällt mir gar nicht schwer
Schwer wird es nur für dich läufst du hinterher
Zieh dir mal lieber deine beste Jogginghose an
Ich schalte hoch in den Turbogang
Bis sich hier jeder fragt wo steckt der Übeltäter?
Ich zisch´ durch meine Straße wie ein echter Düsenjäger
Ja früher wollten meine Freunde immer mit mir Tick spielen
Aber weil sie mich nie kriegten darf ich nicht mehr mitspielen

Nein nein du holst mich niemals ein
Denn ich werd´ immer schneller sein

Weil meine Kraft in den beinen ewig weiter reicht 
Hol´ ich jeden ein Zack! Pff! Babyeierleicht 
Guck mal hier meine Schuhe sind am rauchen 
Deshalb kriegen sie nachts auch die Ruhe die sie brauchen 
Und auch am nächsten Morgen wollen sie immer noch entspannen 
Doch sie wissen wie ich bin und sie müssen wieder ran

Denn dann lauf´ ich weiter so als wäre nix gewesen
Du bist schon am Husten aber ich bin schon am Pesen
Und ich brauch´ keine Pausen mach` mal keine faxen 
Joggen ist für Anfänger ich will lieber Stratzen
Bald werd´ ich verhaftet auch wenn mir das keiner glaubt 
Weil ich schneller bin als die Polizei erlaubt
Ob das wirklich sein muss? Na klar warum nicht?!

Sons of the night
And my memories echo back again.
Stranger that I am
In my own land
where no one will remember my name.

When you hear me calling will you be there
When you see me falling will you be there

Time was the force,
Brought me back on course
In the darkness distant fires on a strand
Time is my disguise,
Against hostile seeking eyes
and the waves wipe out my footprints in the sand.

When you hear me calling will you be there
When you see me falling will you be there

Now my time has come
Return into the sun
Cause I've always been searching for you

Maybe somewhere maybe someday
And your ship can't reach the shore

On the track of a wandering satellite
Our silent flight on a starry night
To places that no once can find
Flying blind time out of mind

Your footprints on the gravel of the daily grind
Though you never touched the ground
The stars beyond reach hold you spellbound
In the lands of your soul

And the cold facts never came to your mind
That your life became a close merry-go-round
You roam the streets of your small town
And your ship can't reach the shore

On the track of a wandering satellite
Our silent flight on a starry night
To places that no once can find
Flying blind time out of mind
Flying blind time out of mind

Dark is the water the sounds of the sea
All the posts have lost their light
Too far away nobody came to your call
Into the lands of your soul

You are still on the bridge that ship out of control
While the waves take you out into the night
As you refused to read the signs on the wall
And your ship will never reach the shore

Deine Lakaien,"Lonely, where should I be if this is not my land
Slowly, life is running through my fingers like sand
Call me, and I'll be wherever you are
Lonely, and the day hides a falling star
And I tried so hard, yes I tried to get out
But the fear kept on strangling my will
And I tried so hard, yes I tried to get out
But the chains they were harder than steel
Lonely, when the bird calls the break of dawn
Lonely, when nightfall takes lovers in it's arms
Lonely, when meadows outside grow green
Falling, and the waters take what has been
Flowing, show me a place where I can fall asleep
Lonely, and the oceans are vast and deep
And I tried so hard...

Deirdre Jenkins,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Deitrick Haddon,"What do you do
When you just don't understand
And what do you do
When you just cannot explain
And what do you do say
When you just don't have the answers
Through it all, keep on trusting God

And what do you do when you wake up
And things are just the same
Seems like it just won't get any better

What do you do
When life questions your faith
And all the dreams you had
Seems like they're drifting away
It takes all of your strength
Just to make it through the day
But through it all, keep on trusting God
What do you do
When you cried all you can cry
When you have to wear a smile
When you hurt deep inside
And what do you do
When there's no one you can call
Through it all, keep on trusting God

Yet will I trust Him

I don't know how I made it over

And say Lord it's because of You

I know some folks so caught up in self
With their nose up looking down on everybody else
But as for me I gotta swallow my pride
When I think about my life tears flow from my eyes

I can't forget back in Detroit City
With my demo tape tryin' to get folks to her me
Tryin' to bring a new sound to this gospel game
Had people hatin' on me in Jesus name

And I could have gave up a long time ago
If I did, you wouldn't hear me on this radio

It's because of Him that you can touch the sky
It's the little things we should never forget
While you're driving Bentley's and flyin' in jets

Who woke you up this morning started you on your way
Keeping your heart pumping each and every day
Who gave you power to do big things
I think we ought to stop and give praise to the King

But we gotta focus on what really matters
Like love, life and family

Let me hear ya'll say...
I vote JESUS!
Can I nominate, the canidate, who's actions speak louder than His words? Who else would lay down His life for His people, But Jesus Christ? And I know you've heard...
How He healed the sick, and raised the dead.
Thousands of hungry folks He fed. All in favor of Jesus say ""I"".
""I""...
He's the only man for the job. He's number one in my eyes.
I vote Jesus, Jesus for president.
He will fight for His people, until the end. 
All of His promises are true.
Every word He says, He will do.

I vote Jesus!!
Now, every election. We look to man, and they always let us down.
We thought change was coming, with the last pesident.
We were better off back then, than we are right now.
And poverty, in our country. Is at an all time high.
When we're supposed to be ""The land of the free, and the home of the brave"". When we're still treating our people like fugitives and slaves. 
I vote Jesus, Jesus for president.
He will fight for His people, until the end.

All of his promises are true. Every word He says He will do.

It's nothing but greed
I should go somewhere and hide

I don't care what people have to say

People always judging everybody else situation
But when the tables are turned suddenly they get the revelation
Nobody has the power to put you in a heaven or hell
I don't regret the things I've done
Cause now I got a story to tell
And there ain't no testimony
If you don't go through the test
And you ain't got no message
If you don't go through the mess
Just humble yourself and pray
And give God confessions
And you will hear him say my child you are

How beautiful earth is from this point of view
So much evil back on the ground
Gravity keeps on bringing me down (down down down)

Yeah
Whoa ah (Bringing me down)
Yeah, ah, Yeah

? just have to let my light shine
Like the sun that illuminates the sky so bright
Like the stars that chase away the dawn this night
Church by it would be whoa like the moon that flow, let's go
Lord, I want to be where you are
But in my flesh Lord, I can only go so far
It's like a test, every time I try to raise the bar
I want to worship, really, but it's too much gravity

Tryna' make it to heaven, stuck on the moon
How beautiful earth is from this point of view
So much evil back on the ground
Gravity keeps on bringing me down
So much hatred, famine and wars
I don't want to go back anymore
Wanna share with the world the peace that I found
But gravity keeps on bring me down
Gravity, Keeps bringing me down
Gravity, Keeps bringing me down
Gravity, Keeps bringing me down
Gravity, Keeps bringing me down

If I can just fly away
From the negative energy that's strongest my faith
Get on a space ship, take a trip through space
Go with me sight seeing through the milky way
How did you make Pluto, Jupiter and Mars
Only you can make Venus, Neptune and Stars
And ? makes me feel like I can just surf in gravity
Brings me way back down to Earth

Tryna' make it to heaven, stuck on the moon
How beautiful earth is from this point of view
So much evil back on the ground

Why did I leave her alone tonight?

Reached for my darlin', held her to me,
Stole her away from the angry sea.

After the long dim dawn
He remembered how she pulled him from disaster into laughter.

Well it didn't take long for him to be consumed
And he turned around and said as her caressing resumed
""we once were close but now we're both marooned,
And what was once a stirring melody is now a distant tune.""
She said ""you angel, you flower, you're powerful.""
But he felt no feelings but his head hot and belly full
And basking in the sun he only feels a gas fire
And he sees no apparent difference between the chimney and the church spire
He says: ""this garden of roses, is overgrown with weeds,
And where the great west river flows I can see nothing but pebbles and reeds.""

And dragged him through hong kong
Till she said ""you carrier, you coward, you're pitiful,

With a hand through your hair as if to comb out the poison

When you saw fish swim in the sewage system river
And keep revising that picture in your mind
When you left home and the crows behind

And the Apples were sweet and summers were long
Digging in your bare feet on a short yellow lawn
You used to stifle a smile or forget not to yawn
Do all the things that men do when they're To the River Born.

It must be her from the heaven highlife 
It takes this girl to realize what you're worth 

And I'm worth nothing it she's worth more than my life
But there's more that me than simple devotion 
I won't just crawl at her feet and utter a plea 
And if she refused I wouldn't walk into the ocean 
Just because my world was left all out at sea
So it was in this cafe when we eventually met 

And I wished I had sunglasses and smoked cigarettes

And the surrounding stars

When over the table and two cups of tea

Obviously not me.
She's locked up inside herself
And I can't get anything free
So won't somebody tell me please
Why the former owner always keeps the keys.

There's no bubbles to burst
No bursting out crying nor dying of thirst
She's utterly tied to somebody else
And it seems he got there first.
And no, I'm not untying
The reins around her neck that she feels
And I won't try to prise out of her the truth anymore
When she lies about the things that she sees
Because the former owner always keeps the keys.

There's no calling
""come here, you're necessary to me.""
There's no excitement in her face when I implore
""corrupt me and confess to me some more.""
And when we hear trees falling or see people disappearing
Her emotions won't be reached or released,
Because the former owner is keeping the keys

Like a ticket inspector running for a bus
Irony's revenge surrounds us.
And it's ironic that he promised you he'd never let you go
When he's left you used-up and disturbed
And I said ""just as the early bird catches the worm
The early cat catches the bird""

And I suppose that it grows on you
Standing there with no clothes on,
And I suppose because there's beautiful girls in this town
I'll stay here till I've chosen one.
I suppose life's like a hunt, really: the hounds have fun
Until the fox gets bagged
And not one girl in this town will ever fall in love with me:
They'll get dragged.

Her heart speaks to me; says the room the room the room
Beneath her dress, and I suppose that it beats for me
Like a hammering moon pulling tides through her chest
Suppose she says that she owes me
All that she owns and all that she is
It seems to me I suppose that her heart's not enough
And her love is a swizz.

So suppose love lives in a mansion
How the hell do I get over the wall?
And if my rope's not stretched the right tension
I won't cross this grand canyon at all.
And I suppose that it grows like a tumor, spreads like a rumor
Like the grass grows and inch every day
And I suppose that before I even know it, the tide will start flowing
And the drum beneath my jacket will say:

You know you need her everyday
She is the moon and she showed me her face
She is the house and she opened the gates
",Hammering Heart
Del Amitri,"Like it or not you'll see my face soon
I'll force my way up into your room
The things I say will soon make you swoon
I'll point to the sun and say it's the moon

So you needn't fret, I'll get in your life yet
Make you sit back and enjoy the touch of a boy
Lie over relaxed with your hand on your lap
Just give me some time so I can work on your spine.

I'll turn into jelly by being so kind
I'll love you to death before your first grasp for breath
I'll open your doors and take what I find
Your heart is gold it's just a matter of time

Give me that gold and I'll melt it down
Give me the tears that I took from your eye
You are not getting so far or going back home
Without regretting that I got your backbone
I'll turn you into a lovelump chum
Come on submit, why not become one
It's just a matter of time

Del Amitri,"Though the coffins are calling I'm not coming
I'm too young to listen and I'm still scrawling on
See-saws and slides, skipping ropes and swings,
Toothpaste and trousers, watches and wedding rings.
She shouted to me under the juggernaut roar,
""this is the bad life, what are we here for? ""

And wonderful world why are you full
Of endless monotony and tiresome fools?
These people that surrounded me were damaged and done
And we were as compatible as swimming pools and slums.
And why are you grinning from ear to ear,
Isn't this the bad life?

Though there was leads in the petrol and bacteria in the beer
Though she moved away and left me hopeless, I was writing
I was here.

She said this bad life that I'm leading is deceiving and depriving me
I said why don't you try relieving me, while she was reading
I was stealing from the library.

And sweetness and sadness lived in sin
With built-in indigestion the new buildings held their stomachs in
Goodness and badness were hardly anything
I wanted to love her but she was never in

Though they were taking out tongues in the land of the gun
Though the sweating was getting near
Though her head was hung saying I did not become her, I keep writing
I was here

Though the dusts were growing in my lungs and some
Were turning backs on the babies turning blue
And I adore you but before you say ""I adore you too""
Say I was here, and so were you",I Was Here
Del Amitri,"I have overloved you and overseen you
And now you're refusing the gifts that I bring you
My hands have been clasping my hot head and asking
""if she submits to me, will she be my property? ""
You may be bleeding but you're not dying
Though you are dying to go
Stop teasing me
I'm not seeing you leaving me

Here is a party full of my friends
And here is a cup being filled up to be drunk again
We are just starting luxurious lives
To be drunkards and diddymen
Making gulf wars and battered wives.
Now I may be pleading
But there's no love nor fear in my eyes
Just greediness
I'm not seeing this sleeping dog lie.

I am the wild horses who will drag you away
I am the locked door who can make you stay
And I will act the man in almost anyway I can
So I can keep keep keep you.

So wake up you pretty thing to a wonderful home
Where we while away the happy saturdays
Between the television and the telephone
And I stroke your head just to feel what I own
Whispering
""will you be my property, and not my disability? ""
And why are you craving
To be free from love's slavery
Stop teasing me
Love's not letting go.

I am the child calling you to come back and play
I am the concert hall in which you hear me say
I'll act a man in almost anyway I can
So I can keep keep keep you even though you may not understand
I am the bee and you are the pollen
I am the keeper you are the lion
I am the holes down which you would have fallen
If I had not been the hand who came and beckoned you

(and I'm not seeing this sleeping dog lie)

Maybe
You were born wrong
But why am I picking holes in you
When it's holes that we all come from?
Maybe I was born strong
To stop love from overtaking me
To stop love from living too long.
And you may be bleeding
And leading me to the blood flow
But sleep tight tonight lions
This keeper's never letting go.
",Keepers
Del Amitri,"Here I am, hardly breathing in at all
I cough when I can and that's about all
I am this man and though I turn the tape to a happier song
My face can't find a smile because it's been looking too long

You arrive like a locust swarm
You devastated me and now when you leave the room
My heart, head, hands and all forms
Go from red-hot blood to bone dry and lukewarm

You're the sticks and stones, girl
You're the fire and flames
I might be half-dead and half-born, girl
But whales start singing when I hear your name

I'm heaped with hate like acid rain
Nothing can restrain the loathing and disgust I have
And there is no one I distrust
More than the happy whores who buy and trade
Crawling on all fours, backwards into holes and fires
That wealth and self-congratulations made

You're the sticks and stones, girl
You're the fire and flames
You're the punishment, the pleasure, the employment and the leisure
You're the sweet conversation and the cutting names

Heart, head, hands and all forms
Went from red-hot blood to bone dry and lukewarm
Whales stopped singing and the ships were bringing in toadstools
And moss instead of sugar beet and corn
And all the girls in the world were distorted and deformed
When the first leech was let loose and my jealousy was born

You're the sticks and stones, girl
You're the fire and flames

Del Amitri,"Don't get so distressed

When it's just your clock reading 5:05 
And why are you so possessed 
By the thought that she got free 
And why are you figuring who's the best 
When just your luck ran out 
And she chose me 

We do not lie side by side 
And mock the thought of you 
And I don't take her hand and ask 
Is this what he used to do? 
'cause I just want to free her from 
Your jails of jealous dreams 
'cause at least a house when it's empty

I won't pretend 
That I was simply swayed 
It was a two way thing not a 
Three day fling 
No secrets kept, no truth betrayed 
And here's the house that held 
The nightmare that went on 
And you're sitting there wishing you'd never been born 
With that self-inflicted crown of thorns 

We do not lie side by side 
And mock the thought of you 
And I don't take her hand and ask 
Is this what he used to do? 
'cause I just want to free her from 
Your jails of jealous dreams 
'cause at least a house when it's empty

I won't pretend 
That I'm the savior of the innocent and bad 
But put two withered old blooms in a couple of rooms 
And they'll behave like lunatics 
And crave what makes them sad 

So here's a card that says 
Happy twenty-second birthday and I wish you were dead 
And here's a house that held 
A bevy of devils and an angel as well 
And you want what I've got

A mantelpiece littered with bills

And said, Just guess where to go 
And the driver turned about and said, 
Finding what you want is like 
Trying to divide ice from snow 

So here I sit, rolling back to bed 
Knowing love is a hazard 
That I'd never guessed 
But from this side of the morning 
I couldn't care less 

Nobody's helpless, although 
I've never felt this helpless before 
And trying to persuade myself not to think about her 
Is like trying to tell the clouds not to pour 
So I put down the bottle 
While in my head time is collapsing 
And the currents run cold 
So I can curse her memory 
But don't try telling me that she was not 
An emerald in a mountain of coal 
Or that there's a crock of cures for cancer 
At the end of the rainbow 

So here I sit, rolling back to bed 
Knowing love is a hazard 
That I'd never guessed 
But from this side of the morning 
I couldn't care less 

And she's the kind of girl who won't forgive 
But will forget 
So take me from this party, driver, 
Put me back to bed 
I wanted to be loved but just got laughed at instead 
So if this taxi is for hire 
I'll get in the back 
Just to hear the friction of the tarmac and the tires 

So nobody's perfect, and that's something that 
I'm sure she'll know

Trying to tell the cockerels not to crow

And I took the next train 
Passed by people putting flowers on graves and 
We got delayed 
When I arrived you had vanished like steam 
And left me in a diesel day 
So I walked around and spent ten pounds 
In amusement arcades 

Felt like I was in a field 
Looking for a pin 

It's a kind of loneliness 
It's a kind of emptiness 
But I'm not trying I'm just rehearsing 
For the perfect day 

When I want you, I'll come looking for you 
Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will. 

I took a spoon to the swimming pool 
To drain your trace away 
And I changed my name so only my looks remain 
And if looks could kill I'd need a license for my face

There's a space for you to change
So you can take this world apart.

And look at my crowd, haven't we all lived like it's a race?

And there are times I sense the trails of pain I leave
When over the road there hangs
Those springtime lynching trees

Just look around, everyone's acting the same way
In a playground town where we can all live like it's a race
Where we can all live for we can take
But haven't we all lived life by mistake?

And haven't we all chased time
Like a paper cup down the street and up the stairs?
And haven't we all found the door is shut
And the keys are everywhere, in this life by mistake?

And there are moments when the heavens open wide
When you can hold your dreams and see your future bright
Look at me now, haven't I tried to do what's right?

And I have tried to live the right way

How you're feeling
The last to know
Where you are

The last to know

Or if he's treating you, like I treated you
Or if he's cruel
I'll be the last to know

We spent summers up beyond the bay
And you said these are such prefect days
That if the bomb drops baby
I want to be the last to know

But now you're living up behind the hill
And though we share the same city and feel the same sun
When your winter comes
I'll be the last to know

Always the last to know

Or if he's pleading with you, like I pleaded with you
If you go, don't let me be the last to know
Don't let me be the last to know

The TV's gone mad

Now you're the only sane thing that I have

Always the last to know

And the maid she mistakes my 'come in' for a 'please leave me alone'

Before the phony night stakes its claim on walkers waiting at the junction

Bought her every possible thing
And the silk she wore 
Was paper thin

Paid cash for everything
Had a beautiful child
Had a champagne christening
But as they raised their glasses in toast to him
He saw the crystal was paper thin

Sold the company out
And cashed all those futures in
But it all still looked so

And said honey it's over now

The damned, the blind, the deaf, the never walk again

Jesus gives to the lame, He gives their limps
Jesus gives to the prostitutes, their pimps
Jesus gives, gives us the crack head's crying wince
Jesus gives, He gives the derelicts their drinks
Jesus gives, so He can watch the swamp of people squirm and sink

'Cause Jesus craves, He craves the brotherhood of man
Jesus craves the bony gripping of its hands
Jesus craves, He craves the cross, He craves the nails
Jesus craves, He craves the pain the mortal feels
Jesus craves all the cruelty that ever made Him real

Jesus saves, saves every sinner you can see
Jesus saves, saves even amateurs like me
Jesus saves, saves a men of evil, men of greed
Jesus saves, saves you from thinking
Just believe that Jesus saves and you can lemming
Like go walking to the cliffs of eternity

Del Amitri,"Does your appetite for novelty still burn?
And do you pick a fight just to feel the heat of his concern?
Do you still misbehave, then beg for his reprieve?
And do you love to feel his needy hands pulling at your sleeve?

Don't you always fall in love again just before you leave?

Do you still storm away, do you slap him just to see
Is he hits you back or backs away or panics, just like me?

Don't you always fall in love again just before you leave?

Don't you cry, 'cause you know that's the one thing he hates
Don't you try to bend him until he breaks
Like you broke me

Do you still turn for a second into stone?
And do you pepper him with petty threats of letting him alone?

Don't you always fall in love again just before you leave?



",Just Before You Leave
Del Amitri,"Look at me, I'm the one who got away, the one who could've shone
I tried to do my best, but I guess your best don't last for long

Look at me, standing with my tattered pride of toothless little lions
We try to make a difference, do something no one else had tried

But if you see me walking and you're wondering why
Well it's just the business of life
If you're not getting lucky, you're just getting by

Look at me, is it written on my face, the luxuries I've known?
Am I a foreign presence, someplace that used to be my home?

So if you see me walking, just a regular guy
Well it's just the business of life
If you're not getting lucky, you're just getting by

And in that weightlessness that comes with good luck
The one thing you don't expect is feeling the drop

Look at me, I'm the one who got away, and then came crawling back
I try to do my best, but I guess I never had the knack

So if you see me walking, and you're wondering why
Well it's just the business of life
If you're not getting lucky, you're just getting by



",Just Getting By
Del Amitri,"I can't look into the future, but I can't cheat the past
I will wipe away my memory, I will find freedom at last
I will walk away from everything that I used to want so bad
I can't look into the future, but the future is the only thing I have
The only thing I have

I am standing on the pavement, I am staring at a sign
A cheaper flight to paradise I am told I'll never find
There are cameras on the rooftops, there are crazies on the green
I will jump a plane to any place far enough away to get me out of who I've been
Get me out of who I've been

I have shaken, never bitten, every hand that ever hit me
Time has taken what it wanted, now I'm gonna get my victory
With my last cheap shot at the dream

I can't look into the future, but I can't cheat the past
I will wipe away my memory, I will find freedom at last

I can't look into the future, but I know I don't wanna see
Another day in Hell with all the mediocrities
I will walk away from everything that the world wants me to do
I can't look into the future, but the future's where I'm walking to
I'm walking to



",Last Cheap Shot at the Dream
Del Amitri,"One more last hurrah
One more fearless stand
At some nightclub bar

One more last hurrah
Gonna kiss our friends
And then crash our cars
Crash our cars

One more last hurrah
Before we knuckle down and button up
And figure out that fading out's
The state that we've been looking for
The state that we've been looking for

Hold on, I wanna say
""My life looks okay""
Okay

One more last hurrah
Whatever else is waiting for us
One last waste of time is all we're asking for
All we're asking for

One more last hurrah
One more chance to forget
Who our enemies are

You'll hear my reputation anywhere you ask
They'll say I'm always chasing, so the die is cast
'Cause everytime I fall in love, out falls the past

Everytime I find somebody, the whispering begins
About how I change my women like traffic switches lanes
But girl, believe me, I'm the one that's changed

Back then, the girls, I guess, I kissed and got out fast
But that's all you need to know then girl, you should have asked
Everytime I fall in love, out falls the past

Everytime I find somebody, the whispering begins

You'll be hooked within minutes of tasting a drop

'Cause she is something, that is true
But just a kiss, my friend, you're through
'Cause when she walks and leaves you blue
You'll look like the junkies standing here in front of you

But hey, you should follow your heart
Maybe she won't desire for just pulling apart
And I don't care if she does
Once she's got you in deeper, there'll be one more of us

'Cause she is something, that is true
But just a kiss, my friend, you're through

",She's Passing This Way
Del Amitri,"Eyes like a slash across her face
Lips I'd kill a man to taste
Whatever this stuff is, I'm buying
Whatever it does, I'll do it 'til I'm dying

I can't wash her away
It's getting under my skin
I can't wash her away
I can feel her closing in

Hands like a carnival of queens
Hair like a heart attack of dreams
A voice so soft you could cut it with a kiss
Screams so small you could hold them in your fist
Little white fingertips running up your back
Little needling scores where her nails leave a track

I can't wash her away
She's living in my skin
I can't seem to wash her away
I can feel her closing in

Eyes like a slash across her face
Lips so damn sweet you'd cut your tonuge out for a taste
Whatever this stuff is, I'm buying
If she's nothing but a coffin least she's good enough to die in
She's a ballroom full of dancing chairs
She's a child in disguise hiding bullets in her hair
A voice so soft you could cut it with a kiss
Screams so small you could hold them in your fist
Every one night stand is a six week stretch
Craving her arms twisted up around your neck
Skin so white, a heart so pure
If you opeden up her veins you'd see the light run through her

With a crack like a 44
And the wind was whistling through the lonesome pines

We reached ol' Henry's cabin
By noon of second day
He must have heard us coming
For he up and he ran away
We camped by the rocky rapids
While the moon was shining bright
We heard ol' Henry laughing
Way out in the night
 
We tracked him for a week or more
Through the swamp and through the hills
Till a rifle roared I cried ""My God
My partner has been killed""
I propped him by an ol' jack pine
And swore a solemn vow
""Lookout Henry Walker
It's you and me right now""
 
So then I started thinking
He could not be found
Then one day by a frozen lake
Like a fox he went to ground
And he tried to run
But the ice was thin
And he fell on through
I watched him as he sank and swore
""I'll put a curse on you""
 
I dragged my frozen partner
Through the ice and through the snow
I lost three fingers and a toe
To the frostbite don't you know
Though the years have come, the years have gone
I think about those times
When Northern lights are dancing
It makes me feel like crying

Del McCoury,"Bound down that long, lonesome highway just as far as I can go 
Til I outrun your memory 
I can't go home cause I can't face another day alone 
Now that you're gone this ain't no place for me 
I want to start all over new 
But I can't lose these lonesome highway blues 
Down that long, lonesome highway just as far as I can go 
Til I outrun your memory 

Bound down that long, lonesome highway just as fast as I can fly 
Just want to go to someplace you won't be 
I'm movin' on to a new place and hold my head up high 
Where no one knows what you done to me 
A thousand miles between us now 
And still some how 
These blues'll track me down 
Down that long, lonesome highway just as far as I can go 
Til I outrun your memory 

I'm bound down that long lonesome highway cause it's the only place I know 
Where there ain't no clouds hangin' over me 
Leave me alone cause it's a long way no matter where I go 
Nothin' but blues as far as I can see 
I wish I had you back again 
But I know I can't 
So here I go again

Del McCoury,"I was born on this mountain a long time ago
Before they knocked down the timber and strip-mined the coal
When you rose in the mornin' before it was light
To go down in that dark hole and come back up at night

I was born on this mountain, this mountain's my home
She holds me and keeps me from worry and woe
Well, they took everything that she gave, now they're gone
But i'll die on this mountain, this mountain's my home

I was young on this mountain but now i am old
And i knew every holler, every cool swimmin' hole
'til one night i lay down and woke up to find
That my childhood was over and i went down in the mine

There's a hole in this mountain and it's dark and it's deep
And god only knows all the secrets it keeps
There's a chill in the air only miners can feel
There're ghosts in the tunnels that the company sealed",The Mountain
Del McCoury,"Come on pretty baby won't you take me by the hand 
I thought maybe that I could be your man 
And for a while (unknown) we could go in style 
Come on we're goin' on an outlaw's honeymoon 

I gotta keep movin', 'cause baby I'm a travelin' man 
And there ain't a lot of women out there that understand 
But if you do (unknown) I'll be good to you 
Come on we're goin' on an outlaw's honeymoon

This ain't never been my home 
Sometimes the road was rocky long the way, boys

Songs to sing and tales to tell 
But I am just a pilgrim on this road, boys 
Until I see you fare thee well

Cause I expect to touch his hand, boys

Del McCoury,"My Grandaddy was a railroad man 
When I was young he took me by the hand 
Dragged me to the station at the break of dawn 
Said ""boy I got to show you somethin' 'fore it's gone"" 
She was blue and silver, she was right on time 
We rode that Texas Eagle on the Mopac line 

We had some sandwiches that Granma packed 
We rode to Palestine and hitchhiked back 
Home in time for supper with a tale to tell 
That night I dreamed I heard that lonesome whistle wail 

When I got old enough to take the train alone 
I rode that Texas Eagle down to San Antone 

Nowadays they don't make no trains 
Just the piggyback freighters and them Amtrak things 
They shut the Eagle down awhile ago 
Sold it to the railroad down in Mexico 
But every now and then that whistle's on my mind 
I ride that Texas Eagle cross the borderline",Texas Eagle

Del McCoury,"Said Red Molly to James, ""That's a fine motorbike
A girl could feel special on any such like""
Said James to Red Molly, ""My hat's off to you
It's a Vincent Black Lightning 1952""

""And I've seen you at the corners and cafes it seems
Red hair and black leather, my favorite color scheme""
And he pulled her on behind
And down to Knoxville they did ride

Said James to Red Molly, ""Here's a ring for your right hand
But I'll tell you in earnest, I'm a dangerous man
I've fought with the law since I was seventeen
I robbed many a man to get my Vincent machine""

""Now I'm twenty one years, I might make twenty two
And I don't mind dying but for the love of you
And if fate should break my stride
Then I'll give you my Vincent to ride""

""Come down, come down, Red Molly"", called Sergeant McRae
""For they've taken young James Adie for armed robbery
Shotgun blast hit his chest, left nothing inside
Come down, Red Molly to his dying bedside""

When she came to the hospital, there wasn't much left
He was running out of road, he was running out of breath
But he smiled to see her cry
Said, ""I'll give you my Vincent to ride""

Said James, ""In my opinion, there's nothing in this world
Beats a 52 Vincent and a red headed girl
Now Norton's and Indians and Greeves just won't do
Ah, they don't have a soul like a Vincent 52""

He reached for her hand and he slipped her the keys
Said he don't have any further use for these
I see angels on Ariel's in leather and chrome
Swooping down from heaven to carry me home

And he gave her one last kiss and died
And he gave her his Vincent to ride

Del Puckett,"By the shores of the Swilly, two children at play 
The king of the castle, the queen of the may 
Just me and my sister, in a world of pretend 
Where the sun would keep shining, the day never end

By the shores of the Swilly, now with kids of our own 
Another year over, and see how they've grown 
Then we'd watch the last sunset, and walk arm in arm 
Till I see you next summer; God keep you from harm 
And if I was a flier who crashed now and then, 
She would put me together and fly me again.

And if I was a flier who crashed now and then,

But I feel in that moment, a part of me died...

You drained my heart of all its love with every sweet caress

Along ol' Tex Ritter and WSM
But they was too busy shakin' one another's hands
Folly I decided that the only way
A stranger in Nashville can make a little hay
Is just to turn a record himself with that Nashville sound

So I borrowed me some money and that's what I did

At least it's bubblin' under about one hundred, ha, ha

But the family Bible on the table will ever be my key to memory

I can see us sittin' round the table when from the family Bible dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing rock of ages rock of ages cleft for me

This old world of ours is full of trouble but this old world would also better be
If it had more Bibles on the tables and mothers singing rock of ages cleft for me

Del Reeves,"I wandered so aimless, life filled with sin
I wouldn't let my dear Saviour in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight

Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like a blind man that God gave back his sight

That I should be ashamed to take you 'round

But together we can find a brighter way
In my heart I know that you'll come true

Came the day you said you'd be my own

Del Reeves,"The calendar said the 30th day of June
Sinatra had the nation's No 1 tune
The Yanks led the American Leauge by a country mile
And I walked the floor as you gave birth to our first child

And when I thanked you for our first son
You just smiled and said the best is yet to come

I don't guess I've ever seen you cry
You saved money until my salvary wouldn't get us by
And it wasn't very long just a couple of years it seemed
We saved enough money and paid down on a five-room dream

And when I thanked you for all you had done
You just smiled and said honey the best is yet to come

Well just think Tony's away to school honey studying law
And do you remember Carrie we voted Queen of the prom that fall
Oh Lord we worked all winter long with Troy and in your mind there's no doubt
Who was the proudest one who was the proudest when he became an Eagle Scout

And when I thanked you for all you had done
You just smiled and said the best is yet to come

The calendar reads the first day of June
The paper says man has walked on the Moon
Now we're sitting here just waitin' alone
And we realize our lives are almost gone

So when we thanked our Lord for all he had done
He just said children the best the best is yet to come




",Best Is Yet to Come
Del Reeves,"It looks everywhere I go always get myself in trouble
Cause the girls I pick on ain't the saintest kind
And I wind up running barefoot to hell and think of clover
Cause the neck I value most of all is mine

That's why I left the blue shirt hanging on the bed post in Seattle
My Levi's float on San Francisco Bay
And I left the Stetson hanging in the hallway down in Dallas
And a dozen pair of boots along the way

Now Betty was a sweet thing I was courting in Seattle
She swore to me she was nobody's wife
But how was I to know she had a boyfriend big as Dallas
And I bid that one good shirt for one good life

That's why I left the blue shirt hanging...
[ fiddle ]
Now Susie had a big yacht we anchored in the harbor
She said she was alone at least today
When he climbed aboard I swam for shore praying I could get there
Lost the Levi's while I made my get-a-way

That's why I left the blue shirt hanging...

Del Reeves,"Ten years ago on a cold dark night
There was someone killed 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me

The judge said, son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word though it meant my life
For I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows nobody sees nobody knows but me

The scaffold was high and eternity near
She stood in the crowd and she shed not one tear
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan
In a long black veil she cries o'er my bones

Said we must part.
He told you lies, now it's
Your turn to cry cry cry-why

Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread

I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it

I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of

I don't know what it's all about

When I saw two silhouettes

Then the shadowed lips seemed to say I love you
(Seemed to say I love you)
And it looked to me that they said the same thing too
(Liked they said the same thing too)
I never thought that I could cry
But it's the rain just a falling from my eyes
And I'll never forget, this night in the rain
When I saw two silhouettes (two silhouettes)

Two silhouettes on the window shade
Has caused each dream I had to fade
I started walking up to your door
Turned around,(turned around)
What's the use, (what's the use)
You don't love me anymore

Then I saw the two shadows kissing tenderly
(Saw them kissing tenderly)
I couldn't bare watching you kissing him
Instead of me (kissing him instead of me)
As I wandered on through the rain
I don't think I'll ever be the same
And I'll never forget, this night in the rain
When I saw two silhouettes",Two Silhouettes

There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us

Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find

Oh, I've got a girl with a record machine
When it comes to rockin' she's a queen
Love to dance on a Saturday night
All alone, I can hold her tight
But she lives on a twentieth floor up town
The elevator's broken down

So I climbed one, two flight, three flight, four
Five, six, seven flight, about eight flight more
On the twelfth I started to drag
By the fifteenth floor I'm ready to sag
Get to the top, But I'm too tired to rock

She called me up on the telephone
She said c'mon over, Cause I'm all alone
I said baby, you're mighty sweet
But I'm in the bed with a-achin' feet
This went on for a couple of days
(But I) But I couldn't stay away

So I claimed two, three, four
Five, six, seven flight, about eight flight more
On the twelfth I'm starting to drag
By the fifteenth floor I ready to sag
Get to the top, But I'm too tired to rock

Sent to Glasgow for repairs
'Till it's fixed I'm using the stairs
I hope they hurry up before it's too late
Because I don't want my baby too much to wait
All this climbin' is gettin' me down
You'll find my corpse draped over the rail

But I climbed two, three, four
Five, six, seven flight, about eight flight more
On the twelfth I'm starting to drag
By the fifteenth floor I ready to sag
Get to the top, But I'm too tired to rock

Yeah, I climbed two, three, four

Del Suggs,"Every sun burns a hole in the sky
Until the light drains out
Leaving only stars behind.
In that night when the shadows are gone
I can feel your love
Even when I am alone

And if you ask how I knew
It was real, it was true--
I see it in the sky, I hear it in the wind,
I feel it in my heart, I taste it on your skin--
That?s how I knew.

Fickle love is no stranger to me,
Knocking on my heart
But when I open up she leaves.
Now I know a love that will not be denied
I can just let go
With all doubt cast aside.

And if you ask how I knew
It was real, it was true--
I see it in the sky, I hear it in the wind,
I feel it in my heart, I taste it on your skin,
I see it in your eyes, I hear it in your song
I can truly say: I feel like I belong--

Del the Funky Homosapien,"I'm chocolate like a bar but my name is not Roseanne
My skin has a pigment, reminiscent of a tan
I plan to grow dreads but first a nappy fro
The longer the hair, the easier to scare a foe
It grows from my head until it covers up my face
People look and stare when I walk into the place
This is just a taste from the Funky Human Being
Ain't no misbehavin', ain't no use for ravin'
Surrounded by the people who would stab me in the back
My skin is really brown even though it's labeled black
Sometimes I wear a cap, and sometimes I wear bandanas
Forbidden in L.A. but I wore one in Atlanta
I chiseled up a sculpture to complement my culture
Thoughts of silly Nubians is prone to give me ulcers
Hangin' with the brothers who are tribal in their ways
For this is how I like to spend my days, and it pays
To steal a groovy sample form the archives
Use my mental staff to eliminate apartheid
Still gather papes like my man Malcom Forbes
Ponderin' my life as I look into my orbs

""Ahonetwo, ahonetwo, I like it""

I love the shade of green like my brother Billy Bixby
I utilize a sample that I salvaged from the 60's cause I'm picky
My meal must appeal to me like Morris
Far too many fraudulent opponents in the forest
I fall into the Gap when I need to purchase clothes
Easy on the fads cause the posers always pose
I suppose they will bite, they'll try not to show it
I came very plain and then feelin' rather loaded
I ditched all the beads cause my needs seem to differ
Me and CM-P are like the Gil and the Skipper
He will use his clippers to give himself a fade
I give my fro a sheen with a smidgen of Pomade
I laid in the shade and I greeted mixel place
With a rhythm and a rhyme and he said that it's a twist
From the ordinary everyday continual assumption that RnB and rap makes a winner
Guess who's comin' through for dinner
A native-like brother with the passive little style
That most certainly will smother
Suicidal rhymes with apocalyptic tunes
I will drink a seltzer while you dabble with the booze
And giggle when I see ya liver shrivel to a prune
I'm the Funky Human Being not a monkey or a coon
Assume that the style is Funkadelic in the 90's

Light skin girls lack the dark skin quality
Ya don't understand? You want an explanation?
Well let D-E-L release the frustration
As I see it, every single day
Light skin girls ain't satisfied unless they get their way, always
Plus they act stuck up
They all add up to one great big fuck up
They try to play suck up when they want somethin'
Then always leave a brother with nothin'
Ya think ya look better cause ya skin's a little bit lighter?
You're thinkin' you're my type like I was a typewriter?
No, ya think ya all of that and all of this
But you ain't really shit without a makeup kit
See, ya might be light but ya ugly to me
Black is beautiful, to me, that's beauty

Dark skin girls are better than light skin
Light skin girls ain't better than dark skin
I disagree homeboy
Dark skin girls are better than light skin
Light skin girls ain't better than dark skin
I disagree homeboy

Now, lets get to the problems
And see if there's a way to solve them
Problem #1, has got to be the attitude
Which is usually vain, selfish and rude
Personality, with her nose stuck up
So don't try talkin' to her or walkin' with her
To class cause it's out of the question
Cause you bein' dark is the wrong complexion
For her she wish she was light, though
I mean lighter than light, or as close to white as possible
But I fight to stay a brother
You see, green and dark skin sisters are the color
This don't apply to all the girls with light skin
Just the ones with their heads up their rear end
Cause if it did, static would occur
Dark skin cuties is what I prefer
Now, look at her, her vision is a blur
Cause contact lenses only let ya see Benzes
Plus she would fuss and cuss if I tried to talk to her
Cause I'm a man who rides the bus
I get frustrated, well, lets say I used to
Now a dark and lovely is who I give juice to
So come on, step to Del if ya with this
This is the facts, so brothers don't forget this

Dark skin girls are better than light skin
Light skin girls ain't better than dark skin
I disagree homeboy
Dark skin girls are better than light skin
Light skin girls ain't better than dark skin
I disagree homeboy

I can't understand you light skin wenches
Ya think ya all that cause ya have long extensions?
Your hair was natural now ya got played out braids
You woulda looked better with a fade
Dark skin girls are so fly, so honest, so sweet
That's the type of girl I wanna meet
Complete, not phony or a fake like you are
See, Del is bolder, I tap you on the shoulder
And say, ""Hey lighty, could you tap that sister for me?""
But you love Mr. Loveable so you'll just ignore me
So find another tip that you can hop upon
To get with me ya need some sun and some Coppertone
You'll take a white boyfriend before a black one
That's why Del has to stand and attack one
Next time you see a girl darker than you
No disrespect when you met her, cause the girl looked better than you

If I ever dissed an MC it was one with a name
So don't tell me he was one in the same
Because I know better, I flow better than the average Joe
I use my Nubian stick to overthrow

MC's out there got the same ol' thing, got the same ol' game
And trip, some got the same ol' name
Like Rockmaster This, Mighty Kingathat
Who died and left you the Wolfman, Jack?
But the Boogiemen are irregular
Spectacular, Dracula, and plus we're gettin' clever
I never had the urge to ass a tag to my title
And I won't add a (rah) or a (huh) at the end of my recital
Hip hop hibbit
I never say a rhyme like that cause I can take my time and give it
Thought
So I went and bought
A pen and pad
Now I'm makin' MCs real mad
Like Young MC goin' out like Sugar Hill
Add a new beat, new rhyme, bogus still
And even if we are in the same gang it ain't no need
For all MC's to have the same ol' thing

The same ol' thing (all over the world)
The same ol' thing (got to get 'em with it)
The same ol' thing (MCs out there got)
The same ol' thing (so let me tell ya bout it)

It seems nowadays friends step to me bogus
And end up on my couch at night without notice
It's cool to have a friend over every

It ain't my fault that ya moms got fed up
And now you wanna come to my crib and wet my bed up
You better find a job so you can get an apartment
And you can save your crocodile tears don't even start with
The sob stories I got enough from the other 
Seven brothas in the den playin' genesis
Damn I can't win at this
Seems like I'm gonna have to flip
And tell those other brothas that they're gonna have to skip
I've had it up to here with these lazy cats
They keep sleepin' on my couch and I'm tired of that

People come to my house and kinda wonder where the squadron's at
They're not gone, they're just down at the laundromat
Because they wear the same pairs of clothing
I'm taking up crazy patience just holding my temper
I'm about to start charging rent for
Every single brother that kicked it with my mother eating
Biscuits on saturday morning like a family
The minute they step it's like moms is crazy mad at me
Cause they're in my mother's room watching television
I feel like giving 'em the boot and say the hell with 'em
But if I give 'em the boot I'm not a friend though
Even though my room smells like dime bags of indo
But I can't pretend like I haven't been peepin' it
Even mom knows that my brothas been sleepin' on
My couch for weeks so your speeches fall flat
They keep sleepin' on my couch and I'm tired of that

Get your lazy butt up off my couch

Maybe this was just my upbringing perhaps
But I was taught that I shouldn't take seven day naps
At other brothas' cribs like I don't have a home
Brothas on my couch so much there's like foam
Coming out the seams and a pair of jeans
Is missing from my closet, I wonder why I even bother being friendly
They're running my ass like the indy 5000
They went and wrinkled my mother's blouse
When they snuck downstairs for a midnight snack
And ate the last slice of bread and a box of apple jacks
Then they hit the sack with the stereo blastin'
And even little tyson is fed up, so I'm askin'
You all to jet, before I get upset
And throw each and every one of you bums out on your back

Del the Funky Homosapien,"I contemplate a rhythm with a hunch
Swing and give a punch and put a fraud out to lunch
And scrunch up your rap book pages
Eat 'em like it's licorice, snatch your gold chains
Steal your gold fronts and return 'em to the caves of the motherland
And ride a rhinoceros back to the other land
So I can show a foe who is the prototype
And then go toe to toe and if the rhythm is hype
I take it on my journeys to the mystic place
So I can dis the facial value of your ballyhoo
See, my style is rather passive but I can get aggressive
Brothers get done when they try to be impressive
Cause I do not impress easily, D-E-L is eager to be
The founder of the fragrance and watch the vagrants
Scatter like rats in the sewer as we do 'em like two secret agents

In the region of the forest where the march hare dwells
I sit and write scriptures by the old wishing well
Collect all my notes and sail a boat back to Berkeley
Tribes feel my vibe cause my style is rather earthly
Some say it's whack but I ain't trying to hear it
As long as what I do contains my soul and my spirit
It's cool, I use this as a rule of thumb
I take a dip into the pool of radiance until the fool was done
Slidin' on the floor like a fat ignoramus
Ya sold 8 million but ya still don't entertain us

With a good night's snooze on a bed of rose petals
I wake up in the morning feeling happy and refreshed
Before I make my journeys I must eat and get dressed
A pair of blue jeans and a shirt with greenish hues
Greener than the grass that was caught between my shoes
When I trample through the forest with my brother CM-PX
The kinky haired nubian there with a human
My hair gets notty without the proper grooming
The whole metamorphosis resembles flowers blooming
In the shadows, deep within the trenches of the sea
Free as Leah, a head of hair like a tree
Cause I'm a love child, follow me now children
Cause I'm a love child, I love to see the children smile at my antics
Foes get frantic and nervous and panic
Even as I venture past the planet called Earth
Born from the womb of the nebula
Deeper in the meadow where my actions are irregula'
I bug out and tell my maid to take the rug out
And dust it, and proceed to throw the thugs out of the pasture
As I recline on a hippo
Write the funky speech and watch my profits seem to triple and quadruple
Teaching all the pupils proper scruples in the meadow

I had to go to San Fran, it's something that I can't stand
It's beggin' for a ride with ma dukes makes a fuss
I don't like fussin' so I ask my older cousin
Could he maybe find time to give the D-E-L a lift
He said it is impossible because he has a roster full of plans for the day
I had to go and sift through pennies in my jeans
To many it may seem that the public transportation really isn't keen
And I agree with the theory
Because it's 3:30 and the bus was due at 2:35
I iron my Girbauds so I can wait with pride
I waited at the bus stop feeling kinda high
From a spliff that I smoked, I riffed and provoked

With a corny punchline, and it was only lunchtime

To get is act together, no matter what the weather
Now I'm sittin' at the bus stop waitin' like forever

I'm getting sick and tired of the wait
When oh when is the bus gonna come

I should've caught the 46B
Cause dukes takes the mass scene and group through the trees
And shoots the breeze with the ladies
Look at that around the way girl yeah, I see her
More crack than a drug dealer
A kid sits by me with a gang of afro sheen on
I'm not Joe Clark and I would hate for him to lean on
My shoulder and try to hold a conversation
Cause I don't have the patience
When oh when is the bus gonna reach its destination
Question over space and time, wastin' time
Word up, I can't take this line of nitwits
I'm about to have a fit quick
Cause this trip here is making me car sick
Check out the brother with the loaded .38
Braggin' to his buddies about the money that he makes
Sellin' crack viles like pancakes
To baseheads just like the one
That's sittin by the window starvin' for a fix
He spent his last 80 cents on fare

That you could tackle the triumphant, I pump up the volume.

You know the time; now that I'm older I'm gonna
Rip niggaz heads with the said salutations.

Of my adventures; attempt to try,
And you will limp or die; whichever I choose, you lose.
Crews get ashamed 'cause we blame 'em for bitin'.
You might win if you start writin', and stop fightin'

You're swept in a hurricane; Del'll blow your brain,
So your next generations of youth will be facin' the truth,
And the truth is I'll leave you with the loose tooth.
Gums get split if you bit.
I'll extract the truth out your ass, like I'm standin' in the pulpit.
Or a lie dectector wrecked ya sector, when you're standing.
I can swing, branding, expanding, on what I'm handing
To the people, 'cause we will, and you can't say
A damn thing about it if you doubt it.
You're already outta line, so let me remind your behind
About the switch, which I used to bruise your bottom.
That little nigga tried to cut; I caught him.

We sap the strength and lap the length around the whole course of time,
And still got the time to unwind.

Nowhere to run to; exits are blocked off.
Steadily I'm dissin' men; I hope you're listenin'.

Crammed up your ass and it's just too bad, son;

Then I know they got my back 
A-Plus must bust the wack. 
Casual: 
I'm fed up with the wackness and this weak shit 
So peep the style and learn how to freak shit 
I hope, ya, learn how ta cope 
By the time you peep this shit here, 
I'll be three times doper 
Yeah, this is for the trendy G's 
To ya bitches, & High School enemies 
All the hoes 
Shoot me to the left & shit 
Cause my financial state was on defecit 
But I, 
Really didn't trip 
Now I'm livin' phatter 
And then niggas don't matter 
A lot a rappers try frontin' on me 
Bet they ain't got nuttin' on me 
And ain't no way that buck can harm me 
I turn the mouths of MCs into molecules 
Niggas locked onto me like my follicles 
I swallow fools with no regurgitaion 
We hurt ya face, men 
When ya placed in my path.

Del: 
I bust asses 
Ya slow like molasses 
As this continues 
Then you know the fastest 
Computing, looting, I gets the root of things 
Bitches with problems 
I leave ya jaw numb 
I slap hoes 
My rap flows along 
With the flow of the song 
As I flow on the bong 
I use Jedi mind tricks 
To find tricks 
Bind tricks, tie them up 
Then I try and phuck then they die 
And what do I care? 
I dare hoes 
And prepare flows cause I never spare those lives 
Who strives 
With knives & slice 
I parylize ya twice 
With fear 
Del is nice to your ears. 
Snupe: 
Not of hardest, artists going far 
Jack off from Jupiter 
Because I'm shooting for the stars 
I'm a mack 
Never come wack 
Gimme a 30 second snippit 
I'll rip it 
Because the shit gets deeper 
Creep ya ass as the floor rocks 
We got the beat hittin' hard like four cops 
Shorts out my last record 
I write my rhymes nekkid 
Let me give you a tip 
I'm on the balls 
So just expect it 
My rep gets phatter thinkin' about those kids 
They tried to step and got phucked like they momma did 
By the Mr. Mostskill 
I did ya hoe, still 
She's askin' for waxin' and taxin' cause she heard a hoe squeal 
Hoes I'm, getting more plays than Showtime 
The demon got ya screamin' with no shine 
No time for regular run of the the mill 
I'm packin' with steel boy soldiers 
Never no more the soul soldier.

Verbally, every word will be enhanced
With the bass that'll put you in a trance
Some dance, come take a chance
Del won't do you wrong
I've been in the rap game too long to falter
I rock like Gibraltar
Make you kneel to the butt like an altar
We move to prove that this is improved, when you're at-water
Caught em with vibration that soothes your back like massages
Before you can park your car in garages
It'll be just for riders, listening to 'Rock The Bells'
You can barely hear the vocals
Mixing is important, getting the public into chokeholds
Hip hop homo's will do well to know this
It ain't about who's the dopest
It's who gets the fan's focus upon you
When they feel what the song do
I think I'm onto something, when I got my shit pumping
I remember, when they were satisfied with just lyrics
Now, if the music 's flat
I can barely stand to hear it
And my rhymes are impeccable and you can't dissect my flow
With music sounding like it's out of tin cans
Just wretch the whole vibe and stride for perfection
Why you think they call this a profession? Hey

[Chorus: x2]
Can't forget the bass, the bottom got em crawling to the wall man
We got cassettes, CD's and LP's
DJ's for days, whatever you do
Give it your all, cause that's what pays

I just love when I can hear the bump pleading to the walls
In the halls, coming from the record stores in the malls
A beat with walls I like that
It bites back and strikes back
At niggaz who are wack, 'cause
Back in the day when hip hop was just developing
It was back in the day
We should be relishing in experience
All you newcomers better be leery cause
Hieroglyphics got the bump
And it ain't mysterious

[Chorus]

This don't apply to the niggaz who salved
And fell out of their fam base
Trying to chase the big bucks
It sucks, I know, when your heroes want to appear to hoes
Supermacho! And watch the whole role and image of a mic champion
To the fam base it simply can't be done
'Cause they're your folks when you don't get the prop shit
They know you got the top shit and in it only for profit
But since we on the topic, let me drop it
We need to stop this segregation of hip hop
Talking 'bout fuck the east coast, and fuck the west
He's sold out, cause someone either sings a notion in the chorus
What is real hip hop then? Only the shit you listen to
Everything else pretending, I'm sending a message to my fam base
Fuck this is hip hop and this is rap, it came from the same place
And there's a place for everything including hieroglyphics
And we gonna come with it, as long as y'all with it
'Cause the fam base is like a legion
For one cause, we want the dope shit cause
The other got flossed ??? Now
I'm a fan who likes a lot of different things
I differentiate with music just to spread my wings
I always do my best, that's why the fans love me
Not some crime shit, so I can pop bubbly
We all got some preferences, that's just how it goes
But when you see there's an effort being made, don't turn up your nose
Turn up the bass, race to go and buy it
Some of y'all love it - don't you, don't deny it

But it started when you first met
You looked incredible to him, he wanted to get his thirst wet 
(yeah, I bet)
He wanted to be down like Brandy
At first his overbearing persona was so manly (oh)
But now you're thinkin' most of the time, ""he can't stand me""
He lost trust in you when he saw you with Randy (haha)
But then you find out he feel good about Candy
You thinkin' this relationship is really demanding
Everyone makes mistakes and that's true
But from the beginning did he really love you?
To him you a bitch, he told his boys he dug you out
And nowadays he don't even hug you (doubts)
And I'm sure it do more than bug you
You wonder how you get attracted to these
With a mackin' disease, with a tactic to please
But once you settle down you're entrapped in a squeeze
Like a boa constrictor and he know when he gets ya
You got to know what your love is worth
That way you don't waste it on the world goin berserk
Yeah

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Now put yourself in the shoes of this guy
You fall in love with this girl and you don't know why (why dude?)
Cause you don't feel the same but you give it a try
Eyes wide, like you a child in a candy store
Even though you the one she couldn't stand before
Cause you was houndin' her, surroundin' her (damn) with confusion
You used to be friends, but now the friendship is losin'
Cause you visualize the romance, she like ""no hands on""
She don't want to fuck with no man, ""not even a slow dance?""
You tried to kiss her and she even agrees
But that don't mean you 'bout to be Adam and Eve
In the Garden of Eden, but maybe for the evening
You say she leading you on, but you just added pressure
Of course she like you, you're friends don't try to test her
She says she likes you as a friend, not a lover or wife
So get a life, let her live hers and find another
Don't let her smash her ego, cause we know you're great
Let it be her mistake, yeah
Don't waste your time bro cause you know
If she don't appreciate what he do for her
Then tell me why he should wait around

Stress the world
Stress the world
Stress the world
Stress the world
Stress the world, stress the world....

I offer the maximum that you call for who better to get a crowd to go bloww!!!!
Del, champion of true I do what the others can't do
So when ya come to, recognize I despise weak
I'm at my peak I seek more then the boredom that you are accustomed to
The conoseur I love hip-hop more, then I did as a kid so I gotta get rid
Of those who pose, case closed
I'm dynamic with panic and that's exactly how I planned it

[Chorus]
You better peep 'cause the price steep for those who sleep
I pile my rhymes by the heap on cassettes, Lp's, cd's and 12 inches
Perform the shit and get the girl like pinches
With good intentions, the key word is redemption
For those who try to shit on my crown let's get down
Plastic ass rappers get smashed like crackers
First I shalack ya and hit ya with the lacquer
Then I go to marijuana class to study cultivation
So I can make the USA a better nation
Get smoked, mellow out, vibe fuck the stress
While I kill MC's that say ""he's relentless.""
Past you at last due to technological enhancements on my part the art advances
My rhymes are ravishing, ravaging the hip-hop surface
To get to the underground for pounds and purchase
Merciless, as soon as I insert the disc
into the SP to make the world stress me
Let's be upfront and real
What's up with this rap regurgitation that appeal to the masses?
I got pure plain funk hold the Mayo
Like the formulation of ice crystals make the suns halo a rainbow
Painful to MC's at large I barge and bulldoze them all when I charge
Personally responsible, behind all the hoopla
Haven't crossed the board, get the troubleshoota

[Chorus]
Stress the world...( make the world stress me)
Stress the world...( make the world stress me)
Stress the world...( make the world stress me)
Let's be upfront and real

Mathematically correct, collect wreck on the daily
This ain't Prince project put out on plays the part
Deep dark funk to dunk your face in
Fully animated in a time when hip-hop's contaminated
Wit corny niggaz talkin jibberish they make me feverish
I merely pull this lever which enables me to unveil tails of Del in action
Smoked to fullest, project my voice like bullets
I deflect you sect. I check the scanner
Damn you're persistent, I stand wit my fist clenched
Tightly around the microphone like a septer
Wit rhymes average MC's can't see like a specter
The inspector with the nectar, sharp like a Black and Decker
I twist a nigga neck like chubby checker
Respect the Hieroglyphic insignia
you know it means murda wit lyrics unhearda
Stamina, stamina. And wit a new flow to boot
Don't try to execute my patter-ns
I took hella notes while battlin'
Dismantlin' opponents alone with my trusty verbs leavin' MC's disturbed
Everybody on my block know I rock
To MC's I'm hella cocky so I keep my rhymes cocked in position
And if you actually listen to what I'm sayin' you'll see you can't resist 'em
They're succulent and if you don't like them fuck you then
Anybody with taste see it's a delicacy
Not a mere orderve or haven't you heard
And it's totally take out about a million served like that
Absolutely a beauty to crush the shit that's booty
'cause I figures it's my duty

Let's be upfront and real, Let's be upfront and real...(make the world stress me)

Del the Funky Homosapien,"They say that nice guys finish last, but I'm the leader
Drinkin' liters of Seagrams with the heathens
Misbehave and break the buzz, fuck the shavings
Collectin' scratch for my savings before the day ends
Cravings for music, collaborate at a rate
Faster than the speed of sound to go thataway
No replicas, step to us, I guess the job was left to us
To kick the phonics that kept you buzzed
And perkin', workin' words, distributin' herbs
To niggas livin' in 'burbs cause they too petro
To come to the ghetto
Mind you, all we do is find you, wave and gave you a sack
Come back but watch 50, they try to lift me
Off the tracks but we ain't offerin crack, just bomb
No need for alarm or bad karma, but arm yourself
Move in stealth, wealth is accumulated
Pockets are illuminated
I make the shit I think hit even though some assume you hate it
I pass judgment when the fuzz lit, take a shit
Just another skit comin' from the pit of Babylon
But powerful like Alvatron
From the Decepticons
Music is magical like a leprechaun
Kept you on point in many different sectors
On Elektra, make you remember Medgar Evers and James Evers
My skills sent from the heavens
I wish they sold Maddog at 7-11
I remember when niggas wore Thriller jackets
And Starter jackets and harder tactics
Had been adopted and most of y'all mocked it
But put a sock in it for a minute
I provide the funk and y'all rock with it
As I spit it, admit it, oh shit

[Chorus]
It's Del the Funky Homosapien
Goin' from town to town to town and just makin' friends
Reach out and shaking hands
With the public and they love it

No technical difficulties or faultiness, you salt me with
That plain-Jane-no-game-insane-to-the-brain
Don't need cocaine fuckin' with the A
The A-Pluster plus the A from way back in the day
For mind expansion enhancing thoughts
I'm raw with savagery, the majesty of all in vision
Wait, but isn't this a good way to start?
Developin' art to cart scrill to kill Satan
Plans for gettin' Daytons are past tense
Stack ends so I won't be a has-been (You know it)
The question you been askin: Is Del that masked man?
Rollin through our cities just rippin' major venues
Like Whitney Houston like when I went to Houston
My father is from Texas, so next bust a rhyme for times
I felt it was no hope, but no factors you formulate
Made me foster hatred and made me want to make it
When I'm in the Bay niggas say (Del, how you doin, man?)
I ain't no rap star that act hard, can't speak
I leak lyrics, freak lyrics, secrete lyrics
From my spirits
Tyranny for all who hear of me
Bomb in a bong, my feet in a thong
On a beach with a biatch named Bonbon
Called her on the Intercong, enter John Owens
Better known as Casual to y'all not knowin'
About flowin, cause your rhymes are all stolen
Another dip on the strip cause task force patrollin'
But rollin' blunts too fat to measure
Mexico's national treasure for pleasure
Resurrect tracks like this from my childhood
Before it was such a wild hood
Knock on wood

[Chorus]

My beats are meaty
Let's call a peace treaty
And stick to it
I'm quick to do it, are you?
So much funk you can't kick it with my crew
Other than when it's time to get blue?
(Shame on you)
I want me a girl that's intelligent
Doin' shit and ain't too belligerent
Picture it, chillin' backyard barbecue
Not trippin' off what niggas are to you
Jealousy, well let's see
It's a lot of that in Oakland
It started when niggas started smokin'
And snortin' hop, fuck pop
I want the melodies
But not the weak topics you are selling me
Del is free of confinements
My mind bendin' fragile and frazzled
I choose to stay underground like Fraggles
In battles I'm sure to win
While you smoke bud I drink gin
It sinks in while everyone else act on it
I macked on it but not too far from redrum
Don't push me, I'm not a pussy
I wish we could gather at a function, drink some lager
And just bust hymns of funk and flav
'Cause the slaves that are our ancestors
Would feel blessed if we did that
Before we hear rap
Now it's American children syntax
Ever since it been on wax
And that's the facts, believe it, don't mislead it
And don't do the shit if you don't need it
And that's real, you might not be but I am
The truth's gonna slap you in the face, so why scam?

That cries for some more meaning

Become so cold

So cold
And all the pictures of your past are gone
So cold, so cold
Forget yourself
And who you are
Another life is not that far

Standing by the paintings of your dreams
But you have awoken
And all the purples and the greens
Have turned to black
And the ruins of your soul
Have died, no more meaning

From beyond within, the heart plays its part

Brings back the pain...

Take my advice!

Always look over your shoulder twice

Now what are we becoming?
Outside the blackbirds sing, 
But you keep down the blinds, 
'Cause each time you kiss her lips
They'll sing my lullaby.

Delain,"I'm walking with Sophie tonight, 
She lives in the air that I breathe; 
I can't get it out of my mind
How you were left to bleed 
Was it how you dressed?
Or how you act?
I can't believe
How they could act so violently, 
Without regret, 
Well, we will not forget 

We are the others, 
We are the cast outs, 
We're the outsiders
But you can't hide us, 
We are the others, 
We are the cast outs
You're no longer on your own
If you feel mistreated, 
Torn and cheated, 
You're not alone, 
We are the others
(We are the others)

As simple as air in your lungs 
As simple as words on your lips 
And no one should take that away 
No one should argue this
Now with our heads up high
We'll carry on, 
And carry out, 
And we won't let them get us down, 
Wear us out, 
'Cause we are not alone 

We are the others, 
We are the cast outs, 
We're the outsiders
But you can't hide us, 
We are the others, 
We are the cast outs
You're no longer on your own
If you feel mistreated, 
Torn and cheated, 
You're not alone, 
We are the others
(We are the others)

Normal is not the norm, 
It's just a uniform 
(We are the others)
Forget about the norm, 
(We're the outsiders)
Take off your uniform, 
(We are the others)
We are all beautiful, 
(We are the others)

We are the others, 
We are the cast outs, 
We're the outsiders
But you can't hide us, 
We are the others, 
We are the cast outs
You're no longer on your own

Delain,"Incomplete, cast in the concrete
Walk the city streets
Granite sky
My machine built the factories
Feeds the worker bees
Get in line

Round and round and round
The wheels come down
Dreaming of the steam
The pounding sounds
Round and round and round
The wheels come down
Won't you electrify my soul
Intensify it all

Little girl in the concrete world
Artificial hurt
In your eyes
You won't see any living trees
Any flower fields in my time

Round and round and round
The wheels come down
Dreaming of the steam
The pounding sounds
Round and round and round
The wheels come down
Won't you electrify my soul
Intensify it all

I like the plastic people paper world
The silver moon, the iron sun
I'll fold you paper flowers little girl
For you'll never see a real one

Delancey,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more 

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more",In My Life
Delaney & Bonnie,"Take me to heart and I'll always love you
And nobody can make me do wrong
Take me for granted, leaving love unsure
Makes will power weak and temptation strong
 
A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man
If you want a do-right-all-day woman
You've got to be a do-right-all-night man

They say that it's a man's world
Well you can improve that by me
And as long as we're together baby
Show some respect for me

A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man
If you want a do-right-all-day woman
You've got to be a do-right-all-night man","Do Right Woman, Do Right Man"

Oh I was full of pride
Had lots of friends
Always here right by my side
Well my fame oh it died
Now my friends all try to hide

Everybody loves a winner
Everybody loves a winner
But when you lose, you lose alone

Everywhere I turned
There was a hello and smile
I never thought
They'd be gone after a while
Well my friends let me down
And the smiles turned to frowns

Everybody loves a winner

Poor Elijah, he had to take over raising fourteen kids
When his daddy got caught stealing chickens from a neighbor one day.
Work on Elijah, work on.

Poor Elijah, he was damn near blind when he died last week
From working in the sun for the man like a dog all day.

Delaney & Bonnie,"We've got to get ourselves together 
Take some time and talk it over 
We've got to get ourselves together 
Try to understand each other 
The time has come it's now or never 
We cannot wait until it's gone 

Maybe it seems like everything's gone wrong 
Misunderstandings are the ""who's right, who's wrong"" 
I don't know who can stand it 
I can awake the people there's a way 

We've got to get ourselves together 
Take some time and talk it over 
We've got to get ourselves together 
Try to understand each other 
The time has come it's now or never 
We mustn't wait until it's gone 

So many things we didn't talk about 
We thought we had the whole world of time 
Then a man keeps smiling all the time 
This world is so peculiar, you have to be so

Delaney & Bonnie,"If you ever live in a ghetto
Maybe at the close of your day
On your front porch you'll hear the sound of a jukebox
From a neighbourhood cafe

Well at noon you may hear the neighbours fussin'
When a kid breaks a window pane
And at night - and at night you may be wakened
By the sound of the out- outbound train

The rich folks they own the big city
And they down us for living the way we do
But when you're born the child of a poor man
You know the ghetto is the only place for you

Well if there's such a thing as revolution
And there will be if we rise to the call
When we build we build we build we build the New Jerusalem
There won't be no more ghetto - ghetto at all
No there won't be no more ghetto - ghetto at all",Ghetto [*]

Delaney & Bonnie,"There are loved ones in the glory,
Whose dear forms you often miss;
When you close your earthly story,
Will you join them in their bliss? 
Refrain:
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, by and by?
In a better home awaiting
In the sky, in the sky?
In the joyous days of childhood,
Oft they told of wondrous love,
Pointed to the dying Savior;
Now they dwell with Him above. 
You remember songs of heaven
Which you sang with childish voice,
Do you love the hymns they taught you,
Or are songs of earth your choice? 
You can picture happy gath'rings
'Round the fireside long ago,
And you think of tearful partings,
When they left you here below. 
One by one their seats were emptied,
One by one they went away;
Here the circle has been broken
