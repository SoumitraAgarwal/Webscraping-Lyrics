Cathy Davey,"You have the same stubbornness as a hammerhead
Don't need to get into it
When every which way is wrong
And every right is your own
And everything is either black or white
But even I know the in-betweens and outs
My lowly brain can comprehend
But if it's simple you want
Then don't go looking for love
It'll complicate you in the end

I may be hollow, but I've had my fill
A vital love I wasn't afraid to spill
And in the morning when I'm hollow still
There wont be any room for us

I had the same stubbornness as my rival
Wouldn't even compromise 
When it was it was too even steven 
Didn't want to be eating
Such a big piece of the humble pie
It was a hard lesson to learn then
But I wont go do that again
No if its easy I want
I wont go dishing at love
Like its something I've got plenty of

I may be hollow, but I've had my fill
Of vital love I wasn't afraid to spill
And in the morning when I'm hollower still
There won't be any room for us

I have the same attitude as my mother
And I think I'll see it out alone
It may be sweet to share a bed
But when you're fucking with my head
This stopping pit is now a no-go zone

I wanna love you, but it got too much
You have to build it out of stronger stuff
We might have something but it's not enough
And there isnt room for us",Hammerhead
Cathy Davey,"Very few have hit the mark
And fewer still made the radar
I didn't need what they offered
And there's nothing hear, to be proud of
It's possible, I hear them
And it's probable, I didn't listen
And there's nothing hear, to be proud of
But your eyes open
Easy come, easy go

You started something I never had to question before
You started changing my mind when I was always so sure
I've starting wondering what happens if I let you in
More
Should you, should you say it's mine for keeps

You should you have left with your airs and graces
And you shouldn't leave them or they'd be wasted

'Cause there's nothing here to be proud of
But your eyes open
Easy come, easy go

You started something I never had to question before
You started changing my mind when I was always so sure
I've starting wondering what happens if I let you in
More
Should you, should you say it's mine for keeps

Something new
You started something I never had to question before
You started changing my mind when I was always so sure
I've starting wondering what happens if I let you in
More
I've started changing my mind when I was always so sure
I wouldn't mind (x8)",Mine For Keeps
Cathy Dennis,"The stars say you're my best lover
Matched up like sugar for a cake
They say our love could conquer anything
I'd always hide my feelings
Keep them so cool and so contained
This time it's something I just can't retain
Cos you give me a good vibe don't you know baby
You give me funky love, funky love
Could this be what love's all about baby
Or is it just another dream
Is this for real or is it just another dream
Is this for real or is it just another dream
Is this for real or is it just another dream
Is this for real or is it just another dream

Your voice it calls me everywhere
It haunts my room most everynight
This thing has sure enough got me on the line
No chance for explaination
It seems my heart has led the way
Is this my chance to find mon amour porfait
Cos you give me a good vibe don't you know baby
You give me funky love, funky love
Could this be what love's all about baby
Or is it just another dream
Is this for real or is it just another dream
Is this for real or is it just another dream
Is this for real or is it just another dream
Is this for real or is it just another dream

Love can be so misleading
I'd cross the earth both land and sea
When I feel that moment badgering me
Could be it's just illusion
But in feeling something good indeed
Is this where loving starts to mirror my dreams
Cos you give me a good vibe don't you know baby
You give me funky love, funky love
Could this be what love's all about baby
Or is it just another dream
Is this for real or is it just another dream
Is this for real or is it just another dream
Is this for real or is it just another dream
Is this for real or is it just another dream

It's for you.
Oh.
 
So many times I've been around you, I don't know how much I like you.
It's like a dream each time I see you. and there's this magic in the air.
I feel so shy but I can't approach you, even though you're just there.
But I know that one day I'll get my way and this is what I'll say.

There were many times I tried to squeeze you. in these dreams I won't forget
It seems so long we've been together since way back then.
I know leaving you how much I loved you.
You turned to me and said.
 
Let's just say that our love is right.
Would you kiss and hold me tight?
'cause I wanna hold ya and  a-squeeze ya,
I tell you that I love you each and ev'ry night.
I'd like to say our love is strong.
Would you know where you belong,
or would I have to show you and a-teach you,
hold you and a-please you to show you that you belong?

Cathy Dennis,"Gold chains and shiny rings
An eye opening sight in the fading night
She knows they're watching
As her hips breathe in for their second skin

Somebody better get out a warning
Somebody better start making room
Deep in the night I hear you calling
Tigers eyes can see you running

[Chorus]
Everybody move, let my love come through
Through your body to mine
Everybody move, there's no one but you
And you're gonna be mine

Just back from Bombay
There are no frontiers now I know you're here
A telegram from a party man
We can dance all night 'cause it feels so right

Somebody better get out a warning
Somebody better start making room
Deep in the night I hear you calling
Tigers eyes can see you running

[Chorus]

Got a feeling that he's looking at me
The people's idol and someone to envy
I've gotta tell him the way I'm feeling
The way I'm feeling, so good, so good

Somebody better get out a warning
Somebody better start making room
Deep in the night when I hear you calling
Tigers eyes can see you running

Cathy Dennis,"We've been talkin' 'bout this thing for far too long.
Watching the world go by.
Afraid that one of us would button up
And change their mind.
But still, you know we've gotta try.
Won't you ever think of asking me to be your girl,
Or making love to me?
Better make your move.
Maybe then I'll start to show how I really feel.
Got to get a little bit of your love, baby.
Got to get a little bit of your love, baby.
Repeat 1st verse
Got to get a little bit of your love, baby.
Got to get a little bit of your love, baby.
There'll never be another, all my life.
Still, I keep waiting to say that you're mine.
There'll never be no-other, on my mind.
'Cause all these things I've been missing,
They just keep me wishing.
Just a little bit.
Just a little bit, yeah.

Cathy Dennis,"Move to this

The way that you walk, the walk of a king
The way that you look, oh, you tell me something
The way that I feel, oh, baby, I want you, you

So send me a sign sealed with a kiss
Don't wait in that line or you're gonna miss
The chance of your life to do something good, so good

We could be sharing a little bit of Heaven
If everything goes our way
If you can do it like I want you do it it, baby
Love is on its way

Move to this, if you wanna be my lover
Move to this, if you wanna be my everything
Move to this, if you wanna be discovered
Move to this, if you wanna be my special thing

The look in your eyes is teasing my heart
Just look at my love, ooh, it's raring to start
So send me a sign and capture my soul, soul

Cathy Dennis,"You ask how I feel and I lie,
But you know the answer.
Words mean nothing.
Read my eyes, they say everything.
I can't hide the truth, although I've tried.
If you get real close, you'll know I lied.
Listen to the sound of my beating heart.
You can make it start whenever you want.
Baby, you're the one triggers off my drum,
And it turns me on when I'm in your arms.
The sound you hear, in the dark, is my beating heart.
The sound you hear, in the dark, is my beating heart.
The still of the night gets so loud
That it's almost defening.
I can't run from myself or from you.
I can't stop it happening.
My knees get weak and I can't speak.
I can't catch my breath when you're next to me.
Listen to the sound of my beating heart.
You can make it start whenever you want.
Baby, you're the one triggers off my drum,
And it turns me on when I'm in your arms.
The sound you hear, in the dark, is my beating heart.
The sound you hear, in the dark, is my beating heart.
I don't think that I could live without you;
I'm sure your touch keeps me alive.
My heart's let you know a thousand times
What words can never say.
Listen to the sound of my beating heart.
You can make it start whenever you want.
Baby, you're the one triggers off my drum,
And it turns me on when I'm in your arms.
The sound you hear, in the dark, is my beating heart.

Cathy Dennis,"Love had me searching, through a menu of men.
Arms reaching out to every stranger I met.
Then you get that feeling.
You try to turn your back.
What's the use, refusing the love you lack?
No one knows it better than you and I.
Take the hunch, and we can kiss our past goodbye.
Taste my love, you don't know what you're missing.
Taste my love, it makes you feel so good.
Taste my love, created for the wishes of a hungry heart.
Nothing you can do, my love's for you.
Pride had me hiding in the tears of my life.
Small wonder I never covered that tram line.
Then you get that feeling.
Pretend it's just not real.
What's the use, refusing the chance you need?
No one knows it better than you and I.
Take the hunch, and we can kiss our past goodbye.
Taste my love, you don't know what you're missing.
Taste my love, it makes you feel so good.
Taste my love, created for the wishes of a hungry heart.

Tell me, baby, are you really gonna take me home?

Every time I've tried to show you the way I feel inside

Why must we hide our true emotions?
We can't we face the way we feel
Why must we hide our true emotions?
Baby let's tell the world about it
And give them something to say

Though I sit and wonder how did we go wrong
Deep inside I know that what we had's not gone
As I feel the sadness run beneath my eye
Still the same old question makes me wonder why

I tried to tell you just how much you mean
I tried to show you the colours that you bring
No matter what they tell me
I just won't accept the one thing inside of me regret

I memorized most of them
So you can be assured I won't let you down

But take care you just might break me
One step forward and two steps back
I stare at the mirror and the mirror stares back

Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,

To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can
I'm goin' back

I can recall,
I can remember

Cathy Richardson,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee

You take romance. I'll take jello.
You calmer than the seals in the Arctic Ocean.
At least they flap their fins to express emotion.

With no insults, and all the morals.
You're just as hard to land as the Ile de France.
I never get the chance.

You'd think I'd miss the letters and the conversation
You'd think I'd miss a good friend, but I don't know if you were one
Still I liked your style and the way you looked at me
Got me wondering if the love was all that deep.
Well, it must have been me, was I a fool or just too young?

Maybe I just wanted to believe I could be in love

Over the Ohio river

But nobody can stop her
From headlights through all ninety two box cars
She will not rest
And so too, I move toward you

This longing's gonna make us strong""

Catie Curtis,"Doctor I've got a problem with my imagination
I don't use it any more
I close my eyes and I try to see all the people living life in peace
When I close my eyes all I see is what's in front of me

Doctor I've got a problem with this consolation
I don't want it any more
In this candyland, the clutching hand always reaching
We take care of ourselves while the rest are weeping

Bringing light to the world
As the story goes, and everyone knows a child messenger of peace
If not through us then through them, would you speak?

Everyone we know is breaking up this year

I lost my one way ticket home 
I'm at a busted telephone
And I got no way to show you you're not alone

Maybe for a minute I wanted to be free

And now they're lining up east to west
So hold on

There's always trouble, look around and see
But I'm not in the kind I thought I'd be
Isn't it always true? 
The thing you had to learn was the thing you thought you knew
I got a new humility, I think you'd like to see

I want to look at life from on top of your tree
You are everything I could never be 
Is it about love, or how you inspire me 
Is it about love?

As the days go by, I get to see you at your best
And I take your name deep deeper in my chest
Your lack of fear and irreverence endear you
More and more to me

While I watched for the signs on the road

I guess I’ve been a lot of places
Trying to get all of my prizes

We can't shelter them forever but if we show them all the tools
They might leave this world in a little better shape than me and you

This big blue ball is shrinking and I don't know if that's good
But for better or for worse now this whole world's our neighborhood
And there's no place left to run to, to stay above the fray
We better learn to get along not just to get our way
Not only for each other but our children's children too

How much can one voice do with just a song
Sometimes injustice and indifference are all that I see
But I refuse to let my hope become the latest casualty
So I'll sing of love and truth and try to practice what I preach
If I can't change the world, I'll change the world within my reach

You want to play right, your hands are shaking
You'd love to know someone but you keep doubting

You keep trying, nothing's working
Losing your head, doing the same things
You've blocked everything else
You've kept it for yourself

Can somebody hug me now 
So I can be myself
And give away
All of my heart

Stunning people are all around you
Stop pretending, it's not about you
You won't know it all
Open your chest and strip it all

Can somebody hug me now
So I can be myself
And give away 
All of my heart

People falling
Seasons fading
Mountains burning
Flowers growing
It's time to shut your mind and give away
Sky is diving, stars are rising
Sea is moving, sand is leaving
It's time to shut your mind, and give away

Can somebody hug me now 
So I can be myself
And give away
All of my heart

Don't be sorry, don't feel bad
To be hurt makes you feel alive
Deeper the wound, greater the gift
Welcome the lift, enjoy the ride

At night sometimes, everything's fine
The mountain's not that hard to climb
You want to play right, your hands are steady
You now know someone you keep hoping

Can somebody hug me now 
So I can be myself
And give away
All of my heart

People falling
Seasons fading
Mountains burning
Flowers growing
It's time to shut your mind and give away

Cattle Decapitation,"For every life I take, an ecosystem I create
Blood and guts consumes my life
I am the ?brutal gardener?
I - ?quantity controller?
?no more insane than Jesus Christ.

Forgive my humble abode
Rotting bodies clogging the commode
Please pardon the stench and the trunk of a man lying on the workbench

Out by the shed are buzzing hives made of human heads
The gestation of larvae tells us
The time of death

Decomposition - An exhibition of life that springs from tragedy

Degeneration - Breakdown and maturation of DNA: The residue of death

The twilight falls on maggots burrowing in flesh
Dead - the dead now dead as can be

The cadaver now giving life harmoniously
A God - This makes me a god

This is absurd and quite obscene - the corruption of human beings
My back yard now a goddamned crime scene

I am the ying, I am the yang
Good and evil are one in the same
No more insane than Jesus Christ?

The smell is part of the charm when you live on a ?body farm?
I walk with the stench of decay along corpse littered paths at the break of the day

Ah, the irony in being a killer, yet in the crime-solving community, I am a pillar
A corpse turns to mulch with a good roto-tiller?

I kill for the good of man

Decomposition ? a morbid demonstration
The cycle of life - in all its majesty

Degeneration - curdling fermentation of heaps and heaps of human meat

She look quite innocent, but believe you me i know what innocence looks like
And it wasn't there, after she got that bicycle.  then we disguised ourselves,

herself,
He said ""where have you been all this time?""",Motorcrash

A scream or a cry, the truth or a lie,
I'm not sure they will save us this time.
I don't want to be around
When it all comes down to watch something beautiful die.

You said the only way was to run away.
You're sick of me so you just can't stick around to hear me pleading
(I'm pleading).
Does it show?
I'm pathetic, I know.
I just can't stand here and watch you go.
I'm running after you (I'm running after you).

Helpless, cause my hands are tied.
Eyelids pinned back so they're open wide.
In a theatre, all alone in the front row,
To watch something beautiful die.

What happened to the things that we used to do?
You said it's all the same and that you needed a change.
You left without goodbye and now I'm wondering why.
But I don't think I want to know all the things that he does better
And how the past just doesn't matter.
You left me once but this time will be the last time.

Look for the feeling that we lost.
Where did you have it last?
Maybe if we retrace our steps.
But we can't find the path that led us here to where we stand.

Nights spent gazing up at the stars
Tides of tomorrow, will they bring or wash away
Our love-filled dreams of paradise?

All the world around us is ocean blue
So tell me, dear, is it true:
The more that you know, the less you believe in?
Tides of tomorrow
How they ebb and they flow!

What a summer day, full of summer ways
It rains so warm here, I can't believe
Counting constellations in the tropical skies
Chimes likes thousands of wet, teary eyes
Summer comes and goes, and who could ever know
If this, indeed, is our last one together!
Tides of tomorrow, will they bring or wash away
Our love-filled dreams of paradise?

The less that you know,
The more you believe in?

You know better than I do, so clue me in

Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlegs

Wonders how you manage to feed the rest

Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night you stocking needed mending
See how they run

Wonder how you manage to make ends meet",Lady Madonna

Cavo,"A million miles away, from where you are
How did I let you get away under these stars
A thousand bridges burned I won't look back
A hundred lessons learned
I won't let this moment pass
What would you say what would you do
Who would you hold onto
Where would you go with nothing to lose
Would you change
Who would you love, would you do it all the same

They won't hold you
They won't hold you down
Cause they don't last",Last Day
Cavo,"The sign on the wall was the same before
The words are so loud, as they fall from your mouth
I know them miles are sure to come
You needed an out, I needed a change
I know inside you feel the same
And now, I've been waiting here so long
Wish I could let go and just move on
Doesn't matter this time, who's right and who was wrong
Cause it's never gonna hurt like this again
I know it was wrong, we changed so much
You said it was time, you had enough
Now I stare at the wall, for the old lights to come
You needed an out, you needed a change
Somewhere inside I felt the same
I've been everywhere to find you here
Waiting at my door
I've done all I can, but somehow you want more
But it's never gonna hurt like this again
Doesn't matter this time, where you're gone or where I've been",Never Gonna Hurt
Cavo,"I watched you fall to pieces
I let this whole world come undone
How would you know
You left me all surrounded
You left this broken by the sun
Look what you've done
You see what you wanted to see
Just take what you want from me
I'm running for my life
I'll run until the end
The only life I've known
You kept this all inside you
You kept me blinded by the light 
How would you know
The weight that pulled you under
The fire inside you won't burn out
Look what you've done
I'm running for my life
I'll run until the end
The only way I'm safe from falling
Leaves me crawling
You're running for your life
You'll run until the end

Cavo,"With a southern smile she don't seem cold
Drive right through to a Midwest storm
There's a broken heart across the field
Where the sun don't shine and the wounds won't heal
With a sober smile I can't sit still
Gonna leave this life and you know I will
With all I've lost and all I hold
There's a need in me to lose control
Till I see you, but you don't see me
I bleed you, but you won't heal me
I scream you, but you don't hear me
I dreamed you, but you don't see me

You left this like
A thief in the night
Run out of ways
And changes to make this right
And I don't need the same
And I don't blame you
I don't really wanna change your mind
Cause it's all run out
The hardest way to start is over
Medicate till I feel sober
Life's like war within
The silent lies that pull me under
Tell myself I don't belong here
Life's like war within
The edge of the knife
The fear on the rise

What too many gave away
It wasn't mine to take

Verse One: Charli Baltimore

I don't know if it's the pretty face or the expensive taste
That got everybody wantin' to touch me like Case
Feels So Good like Mase, to pull over
Anywhere I want, diplomats on the Rover
The way I put it on a nigga sober
I have 'em comin' back, knockin' on my door like Johovas
Ya'll already know that Charli's in charge
Weekly massage, platnuim and gold cars
Money stashed in NY to Witchitaw
And I stay with my niggas cause you know how bitches are
Aggy, cause they baby daddy want to bag me
That's why I never leave home without the 44
Ya'll hoes can't do nothin' to me
I got this game wrapped like a dubee
Pinned up in what?
Charli rappin' about, I really got
And it ain't that I'm stuck on myself, I'm really hot

Chorus

For the love of money (dollar bills ya'll)
For the love of money (gots to have it, eh-heh)
For the love of money (dollar bills ya'll)
For the love of money (really need it, yeah)

Verse Two: Charli Baltimore

Yo yo yo, gimme the money
Rich bitch be swimmin' in money
I need Jet Ski's in mind, can't tease a dime
Lookin' in the mirror, feeling pleased with the shine
Lady Rolex for the time, the class is ""S""
Wear the ice on the bra of my chest
When the money ain't right I go far to the left
Niggas want to play games then Charli direct
want to Long Kiss Goodnight, don't hold ya breath
Bitches know I'm the shit with my MAC lipstick
Crushin' the player haters with a purple navigator
Shoes alligator, my bag is too
If I was broke like you, I would be mad like you
But you can come work for Charli, a boss with a body
Ask anybody, I could take over Gotti
Poo by the poo while you just another hottie
Niggas roll bricks that'll stay if it's notty

Chorus

For the love of money (dollar bills ya'll)
For the love of money (gots to have it, eh-heh)
For the love of money (dollar bills ya'll)

Verse Three: Charli Baltimore

Uh huh, yo when you look you see the slim waist leavin' no trace
Cause shit for no Charli will be in the breifcase
Yeah Long Kiss Goodnight, Baltimore get it right
For the cash, pop out the window and shoot through the ice
Ain't no love here, just the black gloves here
Check it, and I don't get by with nothin' I can't leave in 30 seconds
But my kids, they think mommy a teacher
They don't know, for the love of this
I make the whole world tre' dough
Bingo, get 'em ready for school like nothing happen
Here's a apple for the teacher, tell 'em mommy said ""Hi""
Bet he won't fail you no more, one more ""F"" and he die
Even with my nails done, I can take guns apart son
So when they come lookin' for this reporter broke Un
Dealt with birds, but I had to move on
But for none of these I tatto the little P-pac on my arm
Ask Un how the ones be when he advance me dough
So I put out mines and tell dawg keep yours yo

Do meu quarto de miséria

E ser artista no nosso convívio

Pra poesia que a gente não vive

Ser teu pão, ser tua comida
Todo o amor que houver nessa vida

E se eu achar a tua fonte escondida
Te alcanço em cheio o mel e a ferida

Cazuza,"São sete horas da manhã
Vejo Cristo da janela
O sol já apagou sua luz
E o povo lá embaixo espera
Nas filas dos pontos de ônibus
Procurando aonde ir
São todos seus cicerones
Correm pra não desistir
Dos seus salários de fome
É a esperança que eles tem
Neste filme como extras
Todos querem se dar bem

Num trem pras estrelas
Depois dos navios negreiros
Outras correntezas

Estranho o teu Cristo, Rio
Que olha tão longe, além
Com os braços sempre abertos
Mas sem proteger ninguém
Eu vou forrar as paredes
Do meu quarto de miséria
Com manchetes de jornal
Pra ver que não é nada sério
Eu vou dar o meu desprezo
Pra você que me ensinou
Que a tristeza é uma maneira
Da gente se salvar depois

E encho a tua bola

Tão curtas quanto um sonho bom
Se eu te escondo a verdade, baby
É pra te proteger da solidão

Is it all over my face?

Passed out in a shady hotel room
With a hooker faced down in the restroom
The cockroaches in hypnosis
Sippin' what's left of spilled mimosas

That hotel was so cheap
I should've brought my own sheets
He wanted it and I wanted to
What's left to do I paid for the room

I'm greasy, grimey, two-timey
Butt-sniffing animal
And if I want it I get it
I'll eat that ass like a cannibal

I don't care If you think I'm dirty
I am dirty, learn me
I masturbated till my KY faded
Unh, I'm exhausticated

It's all over your face
Tell me how does it taste?
When the lights go off
And your head goes down
Don't let a drop go to waste
Go to town now

It's all over your face
Tell me baby how does it taste?
When the lights go off
And your head goes down
Don't let a drop go to waste

Is it all over my face?
I'm in love dancing

Is it all over my face?
You've caught me love dancing
Is it all over my face?
I'm in love dancing

Baby, its all over your face
Looks like you've been eating paste
I came too close in your direction
DNA on your complexion

I don't care if you scream
My neighbors are all asleep
My thong on the floor
When I close the door
But I left open the screen

Your exact words were rock me
And so I did some bukkake, don't stop me
Lock your legs in that position
Ducktape on your mouth so listen

Ease on out and then I want in
If you didn't why'd you call me
You got me under you skin
On your skin I could come again

It's all over your face
Tell me how does it taste?
When the lights go off
And your head goes down
Don't let a drop go to waste
Put it down now

It's all over your face
Tell me baby how does it taste?
When the lights go off
And your head goes down
Don't let a drop go to waste

Cazwell,"The Latin explosion ain't new to me
I've been into foreskin since puberty
I want an uncut Latino with a libido
The size of Reno, Nevada to bang me
'Til My bladder splatters
A dick fatter than a beer can
Lay down, stand
Or in the back of his van
He sports Tommy, Adidas
Fubu, Timberland
Pinky ring on his hand
His wish is my command
I'll suck his dick on the can
Or on the Puerto Rican sand
That's my man with the nice clean fade
And when he gets paid, I get paid
And when I get laid, I'm glad he stayed
'Cause there's nothin' like more than foreskin
I drop my chin so I can fit it all in
And then he eats my ass
Like he eats rice and beans
Until the plate's clean
You know what I mean?

Yes, I do, just the other day
I got a blowjob from a hoe job
With no job
Seen him at the bar
Battin' his eyelashes
Show me where your cash is
I'll show where my stash is
His ass is on my bed
The head board hit his head
'Til his head turned red
In and out was the motion
KY was the lotion
And that's the way it goes girl
When you fuck until your toes curl
I rocked his world
With mad stamina
Hot like panama
Shot like an enema
I'm sending your ass back to the store to get some rubbers
So I change the covers

Well, it won't be long
Before he takes off my thong
(But it wasn't a thong until you put it on)
Shut the fuck up
I'm the one getting laid here
He's back from the bodega
With a case of beer and a bag of weed
So I'm on my knees pulling out the seeds
He wants to squeeze my 34Bs
Until I can't breathe
Someone pass the poppers and a bottle of lube
Before he bangs me from the back
With his rough rider attitude the routine
We fuck on the rug so the sheets stay clean
Damn, my man is heaven sent
He got me horny like the ex president
Just thinking of my man's big dick in my face
And then he cums in my face
And then runs out of the place
I don't care, he'll be back
'Cause he loves this ass
And when he's done his friends'll be over fast
You got a problem with me?
You should get your ass off of Avenue D.

See you like the type of guy that works at the pizza place
Sweat on his face mustache above his lips
Open shirt, gold chain and a crucifix
I like the type of guy that east vil style
Chill for a while if he's versatile
But the bottom direction give me his ass
And give me affection
Did I happen to mention?
(No, I don't think you did)
Well, I like to keep my man in the 718
'Cause I'm in the 212 and got things to do
(Like what?)
Like whatever, I wanna leave this
With no shame
Behind me
But all I see is his name on my caller ID
Which reminds me of the time we took three ecstasy
You know, one things leads to another
I see him on the weekends
(What about the weekdays?)
That's when I'm busy messin' with his brother

Vuelvo a recordarte 
Con esos jeans tan desgastados 
Y la voz de ángel

Cuanta rebeldía había en tus besos 
Cuanta dulzura en la teoría 
De marcharnos lejos

Maldita nostalgia 
Que me duele aún a veces 
Que lastima aún a veces
Hoy que ya no estás

Eternamente yo te amo 
Te recuerdo y te extraño 
Uh oh oh oh 

Eternamente yo te amo 
Te recuerdo y te extraño 
Uh oh oh oh 

Eternamente una razón 
Para vivir el corazón 
Estoy perdido eternamente amor

Mi cuerpo aún te siente 
Y no consigo superarlo 
Te marcaste para siempre

I often rushed away
When you were not in common sight
I was held by your embrace

I gaze and see the pain you feel
To think we had to part
I didn't feel you loved me
So I played games with your heart

It was inside that I cried
It was inside that I cried
No long drawn out speeches
No sad tear solves goodbye

It was inside that I cried
It was inside that I cried
Don't be deceived by what you saw
It was inside that I cried

You treated me just like a queen
For me that wasn't enough
You showered me with expensive things
But I found a new love

Mistakes I made were fatal ones
Finally I see you cared
I can't undo what has been done
Now I need you, and you're not there

It was inside that I cried
It was inside that I cried
No long drawn out speeches
No sad tear solves goodbye

It was inside that I cried
It was inside that I cried
Don't be deceived by what you saw
It was inside that I cried

No more prayers to make for tomorrow
Our time has slipped away
I feel so helpless
There's nothing I can do or say
To make things better

It was inside that I cried
It was inside that I cried
No long drawn out speeches
No sad tear solves goodbye

It was inside that I cried for you
Now you're never coming back for me no more

So you left me all alone, don't go
Don't be deceived by what you saw

Ce Ce Peniston,"I need a love to meet me half the way, the kind of love
That will always stay together, forever with you

Seems like something's in the air but we can't decide
Whether to love or leave is a question of pride
In every motion there's love, it's brought us around
To the fact reality, there's nothing to see

You win, I win, we lose
'Cause there's nothing else to choose
You win, I win, we lose
'Cause there's nothing left between me and you

I can often tell myself the things that I love to hear
And I can dream of a love that will never be
But it seems our love is not meant to be
So tell me what's on your mind to save us both the grief

Together in the beginning was a difference
But it seems our love's not meeting half the way
But who is right? Is everybody is wrong?
Sad song that we'll have to sing again and again
When the next one comes along

You win, I win, we lose
'Cause there's nothing else to choose
You win, I win, we lose
'Cause there's nothing left between me and you

I need a love to meet me half the way, the kind of love
That will always stay together, forever with you
I know that we can really make a change
All we gotta do is rearrange, my love, your love, our love

Cause I couldn't find someone
That I could call my own
Oh no, suddenly you stepped in my life
Now you're here with me and
All my lonely days are gone
I don't know if it's wrong or right
But it's better than a lonely night

And I told myself I'd surely go insane
And the earth kept turnin' at an alarmin' pace
And I couldn't talk my heart out of joinin' the race

I would lie awake dispairin'

Afraid of death that my chest would give way to the fear
Pulled the covers over my head and I cupped my ears

In attempt to escape the deafening sounds of silence
In attempt to escape these constant visions of violence
And with death as close as it could possibly get
Heard a voice in the distance sayin' CeCe not yet

Then suddenly the darkness gave away to the light
And I threw off the covers as I closed my eyes
Just in time to feel your spirit grab my body like a glove
And I knew in that moment that it was your

That it was your everlasting, lasting love
I said it was your everlasting love, yesterday and today

CeCe Winans,"The room grew still
As she made her way to Jesus
She stumbled through the tears
That make her blind
She felt such pain
Some spoke in anger
Heard folks whisper
There's no place here for her kind

Still on she came
Through the shame that flushed her face
Until at last she knelt before his feet
And though she spoke no words
Everything she said was heard
As she poured her love for the master
From her box of Alabaster

And I've come to pour
My praise on Him like oil
From Mary's Alabaster Box
Don't be angry if I wash His feet with my tears
And I dry them with my hair
You weren't there the night He found me
You did not feel what I felt
When He wrapped His loving arms around me
And you don't know the cost
Of the oil in my Alabaster box

I can't forget the way life used to be
I was a prisoner to the sin that had me bound
And I spent my days
Poured my life without measure
Into a little treasure box
I thought I found
Until the day when Jesus came to me
And healed my soul with the wonder of His touch

So now I'm giving back to Him
All the praise He's worthy of
I've been forgiven and that's why

And the humble man who bore my shame
Are one, one and the same

How a simple servant can be called the great I Am
How the Son of God
Is still the Son of man

We've traded righteousness for pleasures of sin
And now that things have gotten way out of hand

Takin' the love that the family once owned
Mothers against the daughters, dads against sons
The way that it looks, seems like evil has won

Where there's no hope, life is not worth the while
Why would you choose to live without me
What else do you want when I am all that you need?

Searching high and searching low everyday
To find a peace of mind and someone to care
When all you have to do is fall on your knees
Take a look at yourself, I'm all that you need

Known for that, must commence to rock it fat

You better come strong, faith long in this

You are the miracle I needed so bad 
You're more than what I wanted, 
everything I never had 

Somethin' about you 
Can't say what it is 
Thought you should know that 
You are the reason I live 

I would do anything 
To make you believe me somehow 
So I'm telling you now 
that you're...

Give all I have to prove my love is true 
And I'll never let you go...

That no one could ever love you like I could

So if you'd be the one to share in all my dreams
I'd never let you go
If you'd stay with me
I promise you'll always know
I couldn't spend my life without you
And please believe me I would never doubt you

I'll be the one to (help) answer all your prayers
Anytime you need me
Know that I'll be there
Cause no one could ever love you like I could
No one could ever hold you like I would
Cause no one could ever love you like I would

When there was darkness in my life
But then You came
Something deep inside me changed, and now I pray

I've learned there's nothing love can't do
So hear me pray

Just a little light we can see
Just a little faith leads the way

For everyone who's falling in love
For every child that needs a touch
For all of the hopes
And dreams we share
And for the hearts that cry tonight

I've got to tell the whole world
How much You care
'Cause no one has to walk alone
So hear me pray
Just a little help is all we need
Just a little light we can see
Just a little faith leads the way

CeCe Winans,"I was just a child, when I felt the Savior leading
I was drawn to what I could not understand
And for the cause of Christ, I have spent my days believing
That what He'd have me be, who I am

As I've come to see the weaker side of me
I realize His grace is what I'll need
When sin demanded justice for my soul

Mercy said no
I'm not going to let you go
I'm not going to let you slip away
You don't have to be afraid
Mercy said no
Sin will never take control
Life and death stood face to face
Darkness tried to steal my heart away
Thank You Jesus, Mercy said no

For God so loved the world, that He sent His son to save us
From the cross He built a bridge to set us free
Oh, but deep within our hearts, there is still a war that rages
And makes a sacrifice so hard to see

As midnight fell upon the crucifixion day
The light of hope seemed oh so far away
As evil tried to stop redemption's flow

Mercy said no
I'm not going to let you go
I'm not going to let you slip away
You don't have to be afraid
Mercy said no
Sin will never take control
Life and death stood face to face
Darkness tried to steal my heart away
Thank You Jesus, Mercy said no

And now when heaven looks at me
It's through the blood of Jesus
Reminding me of one day long ago

CeCe Winans,"Another bird has grown 
another part of all of us is gone 
Another right has been wronged 
Still we go on and on until 
The words for each of us are all to real 
Still I am not able to feel what you feel 
And I cannot say how long, it will take for you to heal 

[Chorus]
But I believe you will 
And someday your broken heart will mend 
I know it will 
And you will find your smile again 
Take your time, for time is what it's gonna take 
And then one morning you'll awake to find there's one less tear 
Then you've healed, I believe you will 

The world has let you down 
And words that could explain could not be found 
To say that I understand is not enough 
And it's gonna be a little while, before your heart can learn to trust 

When you feel like all your hope is gone 
Keep holding on till you find your way back to the garden 
Find a way to heal you heart again

Cecelia Webster,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

The ghost herd in the sky.

I saw you standing
I started

How I just could not get it right

To be more clever
I wanted to get down and sweet talk you

But you weren't the only one, so was I

We should come close again
I know what I'll say then

Damn shol ain't peachy 
jus keep ya head up

As I dig deep inside my soul
Look into my past
And all that I had through these glass windows
I find myself wanderin all alone
About the ways that yesterday
Changed the path I chose
Oh
[Chorus:]
ain't no tellin where I'd be
Dead or in the penetentiary
From shootouts wit my enemy
Squeeze until my clips empty
But would they give sin to me
By the hands that was lent to me
Know that it was meant to be
To take over this industry

Yea
Its goin down
Nomore gettin left behind
Its time to shine
Mind on my grind
Look
[verse 2:]
And only the Lord knows
If I don't succeed 
Then my family's left out in the cold
So I gotta play my cards
Cause if I fold
No superstar
Expensive cars
Or designer clothes
Oh

Never feelin bad
Situations gettin sad
Gotta move on
Sun gone shine
Jus wait til mornin

Outta all the struggles
All the pain
All the hurt
Its alright
Gotta be strong
Time moves on
No matter what
When situations get bad
When times get sad
Gotta keep yo mind up
Gotta keep ya grind up
From 99
Never let it behind

Just gotta stay ahead of the race
Keep up my pace
It won't be long
When a feelinz all I can take
I see my heartbreak
Just makes me strong
No matter what nobody say 
I got rhymes to make
I'm reachin for the throne
Cause I know that my yesterday
Been the best of dayz
Just take it slow

Cecilia,"Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
It was grace that brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see
Was blind but now I see

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""

All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

Give you all the love I have inside

Cedar Walton,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April
Cedar Walton,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!

Del juego dulce de este amor 
Que es tan incierto como el mar

Entre los dos el cielo y el infierno crecen cada vez 
Si estoy contigo o sin ti, mi cuerpo no puede vivir 
Si me dejas 
Quiero soñar tus ojos cerca, cerca de mí

Es un misterio sin resolver 
Una aventura sin cara ni piel 
Indescifrable así es este amor

Cee Lo Green,"Back down memory lane
I began as my fathers bright idea
A short time later 
They all watched in awe 
And all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark
But it was only because I was a believer
I was told when I was two years old
She swore that I would be special
I took a good look around 
And thought don't worry mama this city's gonna have you
Georgia
You'll always be home to me
Georgia
I belong to you
And yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son

I'm movin' on
Using mostly dirt roads
Until I find my way
Campbelton road
Cant forget cascade
There is somethin' about Atlanta that doesn't cease to amaze me
Oh, after all you even raised the people that raised me.
And my old man is very stealth cant be mad now why bother?
And you have been my mother nature also my godfather",Georgia [Instrumental] [Instrumental]

Came to put the god in your body this evening
You can't run, you can't hide
Buckle in and enjoy the ride
For beyond all space and time
Jump on in y'all we wastin' time
You can't hang it's an awful thing
Such an awful thing

It's okay, it's alright
We came to put the boogie in your body tonight
Don't be scared, don't be scared
Just grab my hand and hold on tight
I'll be the light that'll guide you there
You probably hate me, but I hardly care
'Cause if you can't hang it's an awful thing
An awful thing, come on y'all

I said a sham a lama, shama a lama ding dong
You put the umm, whaw, whaw
Back into my smile, child
That is why, that is why, you are my sugar didi dip girl
If you can't hang, awful thing

Hey, everybody have some fun tonight
You got to give the groove a chance
Don't hesitate the time won't wait
You might not have tomorrow to dance

Now get up, and get down
I didn't come this far to be fuckin' around
Hey you and you too
Why you over there acting shy?
Have a hit and let me get you high
Let this feeling pass you by
If you can't hang it's an awful thing

You get a bullet hole in your soul fuckin' with Lo

I'm from Southwest whip a Jaguar S 1100
Crucifix on my chest

Got to deal with it

Don't cross the line, shawty, let me be
I got 100 niggas a kill 'bout me

Well, I'm bad, I'm bad
But don't get mad

I'm one of a kind
I can read your mind
Give soul to a stick
And sight to the blind

I can make the sun shine in the pouring rain
I can even make the dead breath life again
I can walk on water
Take off and fly

I'm a bad muthafucka
I ain't gone lie
My mother is nature
This is why

And my father is God
We got a house in the sky
I can touch your heart
I can soothe your soul

I can give your body warmth
In the freezing cold
I can give you joy
When life got you low

I can take away the pain and you'll hurt no more
I can make every dream you got come true
When you believing in me
You believing in you

And one last thing
So you don't forget
You got to be bad as hell to do that shit

Wave your hands high in the air
Boogie down like you just don't care
After I'm done you will agree
Even a blind man can see
That I'm a bad muthafucker
",Bad Mutha
Cee Lo Green,"Um hmm, okay, okay, yeah
Yeah, y'all thought I lost it

In no fashion have I lost my passion for the pen
It's just that lately life has been a lost less inspirin'
To tell you the truth trials and tribulations is very tirin'
I gotta play a little game of gimmick and gun firin'

I'm not aspirin' to be any lower or higher than
I get equal as in eye to eye again
I'm the truth, I'm complicated, I'm all ready but try again
I've got to die once to never ever die again

And what I believe within, I engrave within my skin
And one thang that I ain't is a saint without a sin
How could there be a now if there never was a then?
That is unbalanced just like the yang without the yen

I am distinguishably deeper as opposed to the paper-thin
And I breathe oxygen, and you rhymin' 'bout rocks again
You stagnant, standin' still enough to feel the world spin
I'm beginnin' to smell the end in the path of the blowin' wind

Hopefully I'm fortunate enough to spend forever with a friend
I'm slow dancin' with destiny every day until then
When I first got my big break, I said that I would never bend
And discredit my character to keep up or contend

And my belief beat baseline secrete such a special blend
I am not like them at all and I cannot pretend
I am not like you at all and I cannot pretend

Damn, that shit was funky
Ooh, heard that nigga?
Damn, Shawty Lo, c'mon

I get off on an extension or compare comprehension
I'm in a classroom of my own, I'm too far gone for competition
Yet I'm never obnoxious with my obvious ambition
Perfectly imperfect is my dimension's definition

I engage my pen pierce the page so that it bleeds my intention
With honorable mention of God's divine intervention
I'm incredible, I'm inevitable and there's no possible prevention
I'll hardly scream my dream and I'll have your undivided attention

The powers that be will be beaten into submission
And you will be able to see my revolution on television
You'll get an aneurysm fuckin' around with my head on collision
With the power to get you dead and half the dead risen

I remember when my development was arrested
I was doin' time on my mind misguided and misdirected
I was sick, so sick if I spoke to you, you'd be infected
Then my conscience was cleared of all charges
And I came out corrected

Reinvented, refined, replenished and well rested
On a mission for a medium to manifest the thoughts I collected
After that everythin' I breathed upon, I blessed it
I committed crimes of passion and my soul was suspected

But it was thrown out of court
'Cause of course the Creator and I connected
He told me, "" Fear not for thou art protected
Your life is being requested and you are being tested
So make every attempt you can to expect the unexpected""

Mm mm mm boy that Lo boy
Damn, oh, Lawd, Cee-Lo, why you do it like that?
You ain't have to bustin' all like that, man
Makin' these 'lil rappers feel like they can't rap
Damn, I got some more, I got some more if you want some

I am internally, evolving, entirely
Extensive, eclectic, expression, eloquently
Instantly innovative, courageously creative
I'm driven, this God given gift it comes naturally to the native

Not a need for the dramatics or the systematics
Simplicities, strictly science and mathematics
The mastermind of the mighty, mystical and magical moves
And metaphors manifests masterpieces

Thoroughly fury through the inner mind's eye
Establishes this syn-thesis, of these innermost, insightful
Intriguin' interpretations of extreme intelligence
My commonsense is no co-incidence

Caution, competitors approach carefully I'm able to see
Rare ranges of distance, I expect respect
There's no tolerance for negligence, never, you'll forever
Feel the wrath of the pure and powerful poetry, permanently

Pre-meditative, political, critical, compellin', story-tellin'
Definin' desire, faith fuelin' the fire brilliance, prophylactic
Philosophical, psychological willingly wagin' warfare
Withstandin', commandin', demandin'
The listenin' ears to hear what God's forcin'

Instead endorsin' education ,equality, not hate
Just revolution of the mind state, not mere words but emotions
Which is essential, influential provin' my people's potential
Militancy, innocence, insight, listen to God then write
Since my birth date I been tight, shit

Damn, damn
Now, I don't want never hear nobody else say
Goddamn a nigga from the south can't rhyme, never
Damn, he he he, now can I do my shit?

Or it could be, I wanna walk my way

Or when people haven't been where you been
And they say you still going too far
Or when you wit ya girl and

You could name a million things I'll never be
If you feel like flyin' feel free
You know that you could do better than me

I'm a simple man
I'm doing everything I can
When God sent you my way
It was the moment my life began

You stood by me through the storm
Well, I was hopin' you'd have my hand
I wish I understood how you were strong enough to understand
'Cause see no one is crazy enough to love me but you

Never thought myself as much to see
Material things don't mean much to me
A good father, husband, and workin' man
Are sometimes so much to see

And all them bills are due
I can't afford to buy you nothing new
We don't talk like we used to
I know that loving me is hard on you

But you know I try
You are the completion of I
As long as we're in love
I'll never be ready to die

We've come such a long way
And sometimes I want to ask you why
You continue to be the only star in my entire sky
Because no one is crazy enough to love me but you

You see, girl you know I try
You are the completion of I
As long as we're in love
I'll never be ready to die

Hey little boy you're not allowed to stay
You have to evolve inevitably
And I've sure come a long way

The road up ahead is so unclear
Back slidin' down the bottom of beer
Nobody knew if I would make it here

And hey sweet music set me free
From the statistic that I started to be
I wish my mama was alive to see

The memories of the pain have scarred
And when I fall it's usually hard
But I get up and keep followin' God

Hey, I'm gettin' grown, gettin' grown
(La la la la la, la la la la la)
Gettin' grown, I'm gettin' grown hey
(La la la la la, la la la la la)

Now I remember the good ol' days
Broads and boxes and blunts to blaze
Now I got three children to raise

I-I-I never won't be perfect I know
But workin' on it is worth it I know
Life is just learning as you go

Been selfish once or twice
I had to learn how to sacrifice
To live to my late nineties'd be nice

Every day that goes by I find
It either hits me or it robs me blind
God I owe You this life of mine

I'm gettin' grown, I'm gettin' grown
(La la la la la, la la la la la)
Gettin' grown, gettin' grown

Ooh, time changed but it feels the same
There's no tellin' what tomorrow will bring
Even if I could I wouldn't change a thang

And hey hey, Lord I know I'm not here to stay
But thanks for wakin' me up today
Prepare me for what may come my way

And hey say, young man, there's no need to cry
Because I know you will get by
Look your destiny in the eye

Ooh everyday my heart burns to try
You got to walk before you learn to fly
And we all got to earn to die

I'm gettin' grown, I'm gettin' grown

A thin line between divine and killing machine
A dark side of the light that no one ever should see
Oh, I feel for the foolish for fucking with me

There's a war inside me but the water is still
You'll be safer every time assuming it will
Yet to lose my composure, I don't normally do
I just thought that you should know I've been sicker than you

You don't know me, no record can't tell ya
Oh oh, I'm the great pretender
I said you don't know me, no record can't tell ya

You say you want my pain, my own personal pain
A lot of hurt, heartache and hard times, it's hard to explain
I could feel the anger starting to happen again
I'd bust your head and break your brain for five minutes of fame

My heart beats with unconditional love
But beware of the blackness that it's capable of
Oh yeah, oh yeah
You got to travel the road of a troubled soul
I'm tryin' so hard not to lose control

Shit, behold it is me, it is the epitome of extraterrestrial energy
Experiment and enter the internals of the inner me
The art of gone, and heart of stone, and own's worst enemy

Intellect shapeshifta, God's gift a Soul slippa
Hone in on clones and blow them out of my zone
International Fanatical, the radical tactical movements
Sounds are congruent to it

Work

It is what it ain't to these, infected disease
Thought of automatons deceived, by the deceptions indeed
Who mechanically breed at methodical speeds
Distorting your genes, aborting your dreams
As coarse as it seems

Aiyyo, Work

I could scream, I can't seem to sleep long enough to dream
It's life on a laser beam
But I fiend for the future at my finger tips
One of the minor technicalities of my head trips

You Better Work

The Barea Soul terror, been told since stories of old
Come on let's go and then I'll show how to beat down a rhyme
And wrestle a tempo
Hold on tight, but still let yourself go

Work

This is what I'm talking about
Should I begin to spit it just like the wind
Show my power take flight and quickly ascend
Like a bird beating my wings to the pulse of nature
Scaring spiritual devils while evoking the maker
Is it wrong for me to curse in the name of right
Is it wrong for me to spit life into this mic
That's all I'm asking baby
How come the new millennium brings fright
Something wicked approaches tonight

What good is a call on the phone if you can't speak
And you find it hard to breathe
Paralyzed by my essence, mere presence I put forth
Inherently legends record all souls of expressions
Evil as evil does, better than good was
A spirit of music that once was, born out of the pool of your love
Baby I'm an agent with a flow that's so contagious
And all and all true patience, my brotha Lo told me makes for perfection
While you feeling bound by this matrix
That's why when it comes to protecting mine
I'm a brother you can call over zealous
And I lust and thrust out my staff and wet
Till the motherfuckin' rains get jealous

You Gotta Work

It's not coincidental I use my soul for a stencil to outline the rhyme
That connects machine and a mind
Until the end of time the one my kind, the message will now be profoundly
Spoken, rules are meant to be broken, therefore it's my pleasure to mentor
But once learned you must learn you must yearn to discern
The mechanical glitch of artificial intelligence
But the consequence of your ignorance is the reality I now see before me:
""maybe in time we'll see""

Don't Stop, Work

The degree you'll see will 'cause casualty when the codes download
The truth will unfold uphold until the end
'Cause our destiny will be to win, you're still free to sin within

The pre-meaning before it, preparing for war shit
Their god's only a graphic, the sky's computer blue
There is a moral malfunction, what will the machine do to you
They maliciously monopolize the mass
Niggas sleep rap and fuck they surprise you last
When you sell them your soul they supply you cash
But you can die for all they care, with your expendable ass
Because they know a new nigga, a brand new nigga
Will jump right in them tap shoes even if his feet bigger
Ain't shit sweet nigga, it's deeper than the street nigga
You and I just a virus they gonna delete nigga
Some people say go on and join what you can't beat nigga
I won't take the mark so I can't eat nigga

But he's a daydreamer, it's all in his head
Still today's music has become the Matrix

",Microhard
Cee Lo Green,"Yeah, yeah that sho' feel good
Hello! I go by the name of simply Cee-Lo Green
How do you do? Welcome
I thought I'd seize this opportunity to tell you
A little more about myself if you don't mind
This is my vision, you know what I'm saying?
Check me out now

I have millenniums of material and rivers of rhythm
An entire ocean of emotion that's enlightening to swim in
Also a forest of feeling, beaten paths of peace
Trapped inside my silhouette, I have to speak to release
Demanding more from the pen than I whore from the pen
The line between playing to win and sin is thin
But I walk it with grace and I talk it with taste
I am that raw, simply put and I rest my case

It's elementary, yet far more than resources to pay the rent for me
Everything that I've done is divine, ask God, he'll tell ya, yeah, he mine
So, you see, you don't need another thug out of me
That is the last thing I plan to be on this LP
But I'ma go slip into something mo' comfortable and continue the lesson
No inconvenience at all, I insist on leaving an impression

So relax and ride out
Relax, okay and ride out
Just relax and ride out
Players, relax and ride out

I also solicit visual verbalism worth a visit
Intensely exquisite artism inquire all, who is it?
It's a deliciously daring delicacy I eat to exist
Oh, he's waving those words, I want seconds and thirds
Oh, hush, that's awful kind of you, you're making me blush
I could use some competition but they not making me much
Man, this beat is like my master, it's making me bust
Hip-hop is suffering, meaning I'm a necessity, if nothing

But you like every other rapper, cornrows and a bandana
But I get a hundred and fifty thousand dollar check
Every three months off Santana
Don't you fuck up, though my family is the whole side of Atlanta
Now how can I say? Okay, let me just put it this way

If anyone ever contests my conquest, my gun best
Yo son, just takes one time to be one less
'Til you run and tell the rest that I'm the best
I sang sweet but brang heat to bang meat
We all on the same street

And it's not that often I verbalize the essential element of surprise
I am not one of these thug rapper guys
But this one will help you realize and use both eyes to recognize
The type of action that this amount of money buys
Now listen son, let me drop some shit on you man
I can just 'do-do-do-do-do-do-do' and put a hit on you, man
With hot heat that will make your heart beat quit on you man
And Mr. Dawson'll find a pretty box to fit all you man

So relax and ride out
Just relax, young man and ride out
Hey, you better relax and ride out
Okay? Just relax and ride out

I could take that shit all day
But if I only had sixteen more bars to live
I'd get high and hopefully O.D. on an alternative
I'd give a dim lit dream, a color scheme
And I'd swim for the sun so far

No matter how impossible that may seem
I'd bury my feet in the foundation of a forest
Becoming one with everything there
I would be long, I would be right and wrong but I'd be rare
And then I would pretend I didn't care
Use my fear and pray that my forever would be fare

And I love you all, unconditional, I get misty already missing y'all
And then I forgive those who rhyme to kill the time
While mine cultivate the consciousness
And chill the spine, heal the mind, yet still sublime

Ride out, relax and ride out
Relax and ride out
Relax and ride out

This is one for the road, yeah
One time for the motherfucking mind
I told how you motherfucking play
D.F. y'all, believe this, yeah

Shouts out to Outkast, Goodie Mob, yeah
Backbone, where you at brother?
Hey, alright
It's been easy now, yeah
Can't nobody stop me now?
No, sir, yeah, I'm gone, y'all

I wanna fuck my friend

I wanna eat your emotion
And lick your life line

I wanna make love but it's not quite time
I'd rather spend the night in your mind
You can search your lifetime
And not find a love like mine

You are awakened to my silhouette in the dark but don't scream
Reach out and touch me, I'm not a dream
A careless whisper becomes a conversation
And all of a sudden a sailor becomes a star constellation
Your eyes offer an invitation
And I guess that it's more of crime wasting irreplaceable time
You're provoking my patience
Time, I crawl towards you and gently take what is mine
Sex becomes a song, a slow and nasty groove
About twenty years long and it's as if I've become you
And ultimately the conclusion that you come to
Shh, she's sleeping

If I could I'd dance my life away
And if you can't seem to find any words to say
Make a joy-ful noise, fifth around it's another day

But they came to see God then great tell 'em the good news

A little cash and you'll need nothing else
And as far as me being good, I can't help myself

The reason why I had to have my son
And every time I've ever opened my mouth and said something
Bout living was to earn my ones

Have mercy if I seem to be heavy
I don't mean to be heavy
Wait I'm almost done
And God can truly work a miracle â?? Look at me

Isn't it obvious that I'm one?
And I sing because I'm happy

Who the only little nigga that you know with bout fifty flows
Do about fifty shows in a week but creep on the track with my tippy toes
Shhh, shut the fuck up, I'm trying to work
Ah forget it, I'm going berzerk
Cause I stack my change, and I'm back to claim
My reign on top, so pack your thangs
I rack your brain like crack cocaine
My fame won't stop or I'll jack your chain
Give it up, ding ding ding, thanks, the price was right
That gray goose got me loose, but my eyes are tight
It's the truth, give me a light like I'm dynamite
Alright, alright, we goin ride tonight
I'm so dangerous that I gotta bang with this
You could be famous or remain nameless
Better just drop down to your knees, call upon the lord and pray
Better luck next time, cause you want to open that door today
Your hair sorta gray, it's that sorta day
Flowing so hard over this track and I got more to say
I ain't new to this, I'm so true to this
See what you get fucking with Cee-Lo and Ludacris

Yes I can sing, and I can rap
And I can act, and I can dance

Haha
Okay, there you have it little kids
Wasn't that fun?
Yeah
Saturday morning, Cee-Lo Green and my man Ludacris
Doing this thing, ATL style
This is childs play
Seriously though
I can rap bout any you guys with my tongue tied

Don't make me get serious on your ass
You wouldn't like me when I'm serious

Cee Lo Green,"See there's no way and there's no how
I'd ever stop now, I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin'
And sometimes I get weak from walking the road I'm on
But I'mma keep on, I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin'

Before we came being in southern wasn't something to claim
The fact wasn't something too fly it was something to blame
Smilin' and juckin' and jivin' I was so ashamed
They gave the dirty apparently appropriate name
I wrote about a revolution and sung from the soul
Spoke with my spirit and mind my ambition was blind
Answering the call of God like a child obeying
Preaching the very same power they killed Martin for saying

But you can't break the mold and not holding your breath
Thought if I died for ya, that would be an honorable death
So sincere my eyes begin to swell up in tear
And it's clear my music may not do well up in here
Oh my God being a nigga must be a good payin' job
With all the fringe benefits, ignorance is bliss
There is a time and the place for everybody's taste
But I know too much and I owe too much

See there's no way and there's no how
I'd ever stop now, I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin'
And sometimes I get weak from walking the road I'm on
But I'mma keep on, I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin'

So here it is, an invitation to an open book
A painful past my heart is still broken look
I know you don't hate me it's not assured that anyone appreciate me
See I've been having a hard time selling my album's lately
In recent news the source couldn't find any microphones to rate me
Using words I could scream an alternative to equate me
Which is true I'm in a box with a view would you still wanna date me?
I could be a pretty good thug but it wouldn't compare to a great me

The final cross to bear is mine it's not a cross to share
But isn't it ironic I still woulda bought a cross to wear
That obviously cost to wear but considerably less
Than the price that it costs to care
Now I have another loss to spare I doubt 'em say that I can't win
Even though I know talking intelligent just ain't in
You most likely to go broke when you just can't bend
So me and J J both gon' have to pay bills

See there's no way and there's no how
I'd ever stop now, I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin'
And sometimes I get weak from walking the road I'm on
But I'mma keep on, I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin'

Listen, people still standin' in line at the world party for some soul food
To get put back in that old mood they say, we like the new 'lo
And we respect everything that you trying to do 'lo
Do what you do but just do more that you know
It's a catch 22 and I couldn't cry
Now I'm under oath with them both and I couldn't lie

Cussed 'em said that I'm too dope and I couldn't fly
But you getting rich talkin' shit so why shouldn't I
I'm just playing but I guess that couldn't go without saying
I'm just gon' ride this revolution until they stop me where I'm stayin'
But I ain't gotta have to lie to ya to make it sound fly to ya
I keep my feet on the ground and bring the sky to ya

See there's no way and there's no how
I'd ever stop now, I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin'
And sometimes I get weak from walking the road I'm on
But I'mma keep on, I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin'",Die Trying
Cee Lo Green,"And now, the night time...

Late in the evening
There is the thieving and the trickin and the trappin
And they ain't actin'
We make it happen
We'll get the guns on anyones and get to clappin'
Even for rappin'
Does it surprise ya?
We'll readjust and reconcile and recognize up
That I'm a writer
Oh yes I write up
Now open wide and let me put the night inside ya

This is music usually confused with major motion picture
No one is stricter about it being status for scripture
No put on your gut is goin', you're wearin' what don't fit ya
You better run little one, cause the rhythm's gonna getcha
And when it hits ya, it usually hits somebody with ya
Make 'em risk a total eclipse of sun to get richer
Baby, a little time and something fine that'll fix ya
With shield love you forgot to remember to miss the - (??)
The nightlife ? the dark side of the city
Gon' be on 24 inches, and be defenseless
The nightlife ? the dark side of my heart
Where no one really knows you, and no one supposed you
The nightlife ? the dark side of my soul
Where if somebody crossed you, kill 'em up off you!
The nightlife ? the dark side of the moon
Where the sun is scared to come
(give me some) ha!

[Chorus:]
Take me where the darkness is still beautiful!

Oohhh...wanna go, want to go, want to go, want to know, want to go, want to go
Want to go, want to go, want to go, want to know, want to go, want to go
Give me the night!

I'll be your lady
Farewell the friend
I'll be honest
And I'll pretend

Take me where the darkness is still beautiful!

I've been runnin' since rock box
I've cocked locks and locked blocks and rocked rocks
And dropped tops
The obviously odd, five foot six inch guard
In the flesh
I've been the best
I'll get in your chest and in the mess
In your vest and out your back without even getting out the 'llac
I lied about how I really handled that situation about the AK
I'll hit back
If your lead was the only collateral you got I'll get back
Now get flat
Say a prayer cause shorty want this shit back
Sit back, this chit-chat is pitch black
But you can still see what I'm sayin'
And heavy is how I weigh in
Niggaz love singin' sad songs about how bad they want to stay in
Either hold out on basketball playin or make use of some yay' then

Whooowhooo

Brother... you've been on my mind
Oh brother
We've changed over time so
Brother, I'm keeping my eyes on you
I bet you don't think I know no bett'(er)
But sanging the blues
Oh but brother have I got news for you
I'm something... and I know you know that I'm something too
(chuckle)

Yeah, usually I don't get into all this battle rap shit and all that
Shit's stupid
But I'm gonna address it
And after I get it off my chest may God bless it
I will invest four minutes exactly for everyone who had the audacity to attack me

I kept quiet but perhaps I should have pushed this fire quicker
Cause to just sit with this shit I've only gotten sicker
Yet I react without even a crack in my composure
But the only way he knows to bring this shit to a closure
I'm worthy, and my associates and I named the South Dirty
And I'm even for sale in Braille, the deaf, dumb and blind have heard me
But I ain't even breathin until I get an even 30
I could casually clap up the front of somebody's throwback jersey
You makin' me hafta talk this way, aintcha?
You makin' me hafta talk this way
You forcin me to walk this way
Maybe my album will get bought this way
Niggaz slow down around me, I make em superstitious
And one of my vices used to be wanting to look visually vicious
But instead I use my head and I fed niggaz something nutritious
But you will appreiciate what a sacrifice this is
And I know you ambitious young men, you have my best wishes
Have a piece of this pain on a platter, it's one of my best dishes
When you assassinate my character, not one remark misses

Fuck fakin, there has been some offense",Glockapella
Cee Lo Green,"I am the music
I've yet to define myself as just, one thing
Let's just say that

I am the actual and factual supernatural sight and surrounds
Signification of conversation
Two or more words rhyming in song form or spoken syncopation
The reason the rudery reanimation and realization of life is rhythm
I am the heartbeat and the heartache, the here and now

I am the purpose, the point, the living proof of a God somewhere
The lifeline, lifelike lazer beam, the progression and direction
Always will be always was what all comes from and all must return
The center of a perfect circle, I am your soul

Music of your mind, each feeling causing each function
To be in conjunction with the music, I am the music

I am the music

Let's get started shall we? 'Cause you know it's time gone
Every time these n****z rhyme wrong
So uhh, lights, camera, action I'm on
I'll have them standing in line to get their mind blown

I'm selling soul, rapping and singing, and screaming, and yelling soul
Manufacturing, marketing, pricing, packaging and e-mailing soul
With no rehearsal, this one verse'll whole hearse you
Now a commercial but what I must first do

Is make my presentation a bit more personal
Everything must go for a small price you can have the heart of me
There is no part of me that can't be calculated into a commodity
My musings amount to a milestone a million miles above monotony

And it'll make you feel so good, it got to be God, it got to be
I paint prophecy, you know airbrush atrocity with philosophy
And people ask me am I gon' preach one of these days
And I just tell 'em, ""Possibly"", if you let me

I'll end up being everything probably and obviously
It's like any other job would be so you might as well thank God for me
But isn't it amazing, how the antenna ain't nothing but a sinner
You just can't go and be ordained over dinner

Now I can interest an intellectual or A be see it for a beginner
But yes my seasons still change and it is almost winter
And it give it to you at God-speed but yet it's gentle
And when I rhyme I make reading fundamentals

Or even black and white, my lyric is live and living color
My flow if fluorescent like scripture highlighted in bright yellow
And all this for 999, s*** that's wonderful
And the great thing about it is, if you disagree you're money's refundable

But there's always something rewarding about every Cee-Lo Green Recording 'cause even after all your expenses
People still aspire affording
It's incredible how convincing I can be with a camera pointed at me
But really sometimes rapping feel like tapping to make a cracker happy

But when the dat play and the beat get bumping like adolescent acne
It's kinda sad but it's show time, my sentiment exactly
So don't get mad, everybody's doing it, you know you wouldn't mind
A commercial with your own tennis shoe in it

Whether you're selling a dream, selling a scheme or playing a role
Like it or not we're selling soul

We all do what we want and don't know what we need, mm, mm
Life is good 'til three then bittersweet indeed, mm, hmm

Well, I'm so human, it is a goddamn shame, I'm your thing
And I'm not sure that I'll always keep us in pain, yes sir
And to remind you of that I'll survive somehow, oh
And with freedom that I can still be your man right now and now

Just live

Well, I've struggled so hard that I survived
And it's a miracle that I'm still alive

Said stand up, everybody, uh, this is your life
You gotta get it when you can y'all
Half rich for months is your knife
We can't forget about the brothers, the sisters
The lovers who ain't here
You only got one life, y'all, and I repeat the point it ain't clear
And if it ain't fair then what's stopping you from going

Do you not want to be responsible for knowing
'cause ignorance is bliss and ignorance is just so fucking ignorant
You may even be ignorant of this
If you say so my Desoto's the significance of this
I'm good lookin', still fuckin', so fools don't make a dish
Light a candle for love, blow it out and make a wish
And I hope I die happy like fish

'cause I wanna hut two, three, four, what the hell are you waiting for?

How why'all feel out there
That's cool
Alright
You know, sometimes I want to rap
Sometimes I want to sing, you know what I mean
Sometimes all it calls for is a nice mellow groove
Hit of rimshot, you know
Just get, you know, get you open
But I want to do a piece for why'all tonight, it's called sometimes
Alright, so check it out

Sometimes a stranger can be your best friend
Sometimes being angry is the best mood
Sometimes seeing you feel good makes me feel even better
Sometimes hunger is the best food
Sometimes good just ain't good enough
And other times evil will get you even
Sometimes faith is not knowing any better
Sometimes nothing is what you believe in
Woah

Sometimes I don't even want a hit
Sometimes you fail trying
And sometimes happiness hurts worse
Sometimes people live dying
Sometimes it's the last person that makes you first
Sometimes you'll keep what you don't want
And other times you'll give away what you really need
Sometimes a rich man won't have a dollar
And all a poor man has is greed
Woah

Sometimes
Sometimes I just want to listen
Sounds good to me
Yeah
Ay yo Lock, put them strings right here
Sometimes I don't think people know I'm as good as I really am

Now my recitings are writing over rhythm's
Regularly reenacts facts of my existence
So what proof of my expertise, many emcees know of me
Using unrequested serious infested poetry
To prevoke what persistence
For instance, I don't let the T.V. screen come in between my daily routine
At a spot where me and my boy went
Someone interrupted our enjoyment
What do you know, an out of work emcee looking for employment
But I'm still courteous with my greeting, brother I'm eating
And his style sounded similar to someone elses
So evidently he's been cheating
But I couldn't question the destiny in which we meet
So, you guessed it, I suggested that he just have a seat
And then I explained to him that I remained in the mean time
Mastering mysterious methods of writing
Finding my piece of mind with soft music and moonlighting
Then supernaturally I foresee the beginning stages
And then eventually pages get filled completely
You see, I dive into the depths of my soul
Seeking to explore the hidden treasure of a pure literature
While these others are unsure
Being that the deepness makes them doubtful
Deliberately delaying
Saying they'll settle for whatever washes toward the shore
Delirious from delusion
My feelings were no more direct so the conclusion is seclusion
Because mixed belief create confusion
To remain plain and simplistic, realistic
Accurate, articulate and absolutely artistic
Uninhibited, unadulterated, unstoppable
Unfuckwittable and unforgettable
But since I've been granted the power of choice
Let God bet the voice he is
So all the credibility be his
So let these be words of wisdom and in the same breath be warning
God I shine like Sunday morning
Woah

Now I came here for you to love, it's computer love
I make them cut through the rug when I do the club
I can take some mental electric sex, refuting love
But Gunplay will be graphic if I do the thug

The day to day experience is the data that I download
And then remaster onto a rapture
Abracadabra before and after, over and over
Losing account of all the dreams that I sold ya

But then I gave ya, at the speed of light trying to save ya
Then I go and now come back a row, whoa
And oh I'm technic to God in a fashion
But you can just call me Lo Go

Whenever you want some soul
Start him up
Whenever you need some soul
Start him up

See he's been given the power
To take you wherever you want to go
Start him up
And tell him what you want

Once you start up the soul machine
You will see what I mean
Open your eyes and enjoy the dream
He can do anything

I'm looking for a brother who likes to have fun,
A fly gentlemen that who knows how to please.

Last thing I need is a man who's soft, 
He better get it on up, and break me off,

But I'm from Southwest and every
Now and then I get put to the test
But I can't be stopped
Cause I gotta come true ain't go no gun
But I got my crew
Didn't come fro no beef cause I don't eat steak
I got a plate of soul food chicken, rice and gravy
Not covered in too much
Drinking a cup of punch, tropical
Every last Thursday of the month

Daddy put tha hot grits on my chest in tha morning
When I was sick Mary had tha hot soup boiling
Didn't know why but it felt so good
Like some waffles in that morning
Headed back to tha woods
Now I'm full as tick
Got some soul on blast in tha cassette
Food for my brain
I haven't stopped learning yet
Hot wings from Mo-Joes
Got my forehead sweating
Celery and blue cheese on my menu next

Southern Fry won't allow my body to lie still
Tied face goons surround me like cancer drill
me with second-hand obstables
But, only to make matters worse
Plus I'm getting pimped by this temp lady Jackie
From Optima staffing figure laughing
Shut up clown don't talk to me
Like that looking stupid of course
living day by day and you ain't hard
Trick hell you say?
It's such a blessing when my eyes
Get to see the sun rise
To get further away from where I've been
But I'll never gorget everythang I went through
I appreciate the shit because
If I hada went and took the easy way
i wouldn't be the strong nigga that I am today
Everythang that I did
Different thangs I was told
Just ended up being tood for my soul

Sunday morning where you reating at?
I'm on 1365 Wichita Drive
Ole' burd working the stove ride
Churches dripping chicken in yesterday's grease
Didn't go together with this quart of Mickey's
Last night hanging over from a good time
yeah beef is cheaper but
It's pumped with ""red dye"" between two pieces of bread
Shawty look good with dem hairy legs
Wish I could cut her up but, ma stomach come before sex
A house full of hoes now what's the ingredient
Spaghetty plus her monthly flow
They know they making it hard on the yard
Fuck Chris Darden, fuck Marsha Clark
Taking us when we're in the spotlight for a joke
Changing by the day I see it's getting bigga in my square
Looking at Lenox from the outside
With a stare no money to go inside
Tameka and Tiffany outside tripping
And skipping rope to the beats from my jeep
As I speak wuz up from the driver seat

A heaping helping of fried chicken
Macaroni and cheese and collard greens
Too big for my jeans
Somke steams from under the lid that's on the pot
Ain't never had allot but thankful for
The little that I got why not be
Fast food got me feeling sick
Them crackers think they sick
By trying to make this bullshit affordable
I thank the Lord that my voice was recordable
Come an get your soul food well well..
Hold up see it's what I write
And Miss Lady acting like we in jail 
Says she ain't got no extra hush puppis to sell
Bankhead seafood making me hit that door
With a mind full of attitude
It was a line at tha beautiful
JJ'S Ribshack was packed too
Looking to be one of dem days
When Momma ain't cooking
Everybody's out hunting with tha family
Looking for a little soul food

Expose themselves to any Tom, Dick, and Hank

See Sega ain't in this new world order 
Them experimenting in Atlanta, Georgia
United Nations, overseas
They trained assassins to do search and seize
Ain't knocking or asking
Them coming for niggas like me
Po' white trash, like they
Tricks like her back in slavery
Concentration camps lace with gas pipes lines
Inferno's outdoors like they had back
When Adolf Hitler was living in 1945
Listen to me now, believe me
Later on in the future look it up
Where they say it?  Ain't no more Constitution
In the event of a race war
Places like operation heartbreak hotel
Moments tear until air tight vents seat off despair
Them say expect no mercy
Foot you should be my least worries got to deal with
Where my W-2's, 10-99's
Unmarked black helicopters swoop down
And try to put missiles in mines

POW nobody now

Me and my family moved in our apartment complex
A gate with the serial code was put up next
The claim that this community is so drug free
But it don't look that way to me cause I can see
The young bloods hanging out at the store 24/7
Junkies looking got a hit of the blow it's powerful
Oh you know what else they tryin to do
Make a curfew especially for me and you the traces of the new world order
Time is getting shorter if we don't get prepared
People it's gone be a slaughter
My mind won't allow me to not be curious
My folk don't understand so they don't take it serious

If the gate was put up to keep crime out or to keep our ass in

Listen up little niggas I'm talking to you
About what yo little ass need to be going through
I fall a victim too and I know I shouldn't smoke so much
But I do with the crew everybody on the average 'bout 4 or 5
I'm lucky to be alive at sunrise now I realize the cost
After I lost my best friend Bean I recognize as a King
Who am I to tell you to stop smokin
Now you're open to disease and colds
And ain't sixteen years old, this shit has got to stop
Let's take a walk through detox
I want outta this hold I'm in a cell under attack
Lock up folks they in the hood, got an eye on every move
I make open your face to info you ain't know
Cause it's kept low how the new world plan
Reeks the planet without the black man

So what's your angle, try to separate me from the blood
Is disrespect like coming in my home and not
Wiping your feet on the rug
The Citron Absolut has got me bucking no hang with no phony
Look out for the man with the mask and the white pony
On my back are bills staying off my toes always on my heels
Insane, plain, soldiers coming in the dark by plane
To enforce the new system by reign
Tag my skin with your computer chip
Run your hand over the scanner to buy you dish now
No more fishing for your fish

Beautiful, what’s your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to that fireplace roar
So really I’d better scurry
Beautiful, please don’t hurry

Why don't you put some records on while I pour

Baby, it’s bad out there
Say, what’s in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight

I’ll take your hat, your hair looks swell

I ought to say no, no, no, sir

At least I’m gonna say that I tried
What’s the sense in hurting my pride?

I simply must go
See that it’s cold outside.
The answer is no
I said it's cold out there.
This welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in.
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm.

Gosh, your lips look delicious.
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore.
My maiden aunt’s mind is vicious
Oh, your lips are delicious.
Maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before.

Hey I’ve got to go home
Baby, you’ll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat
It’s up to your knees out there
You’ve really been grand
I’m thrilled when you touch my hand
But don’t you see
How can you do this thing to me?

There’s bound to be talk tomorrow

Step out on faith

Then I look and I swear I saw you smilin'
Well heaven makes these tender hearts the strongest

Oh, and the dream that saves me is
That you're happy and that your free

It'll fly through the air with the greatest of ease
As much as you want now, as much as you need
Across every mountain, and all seven seas
Oh, the eagles will carry it on God's gentle breeze

Celadon Candy,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Sweet/Broken/Undercutter

The soaking wet behind my ears
The bloodstain on my name
The same disease I've had for years

He would say to stay away
But why should I heed advice? (The hospital charges twice)

When it's possible to feel worse

I want you to be my Undercutter
We'll watch the stars, lying in the gutter

I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance

Would you stop scheming and trying to look hard
I'll get my bodyguard, You'll get that booty scarred,
I'm a veteran which means that I've been
In the game too long Since the days of Paper Thin
Way back when I've been putting it down
Ask your homies who's the baddest bitch on this side of town
I float like a butterfly sting like a bee,
Spectacular on the M I C,
I go for broke, Never giving it less than the best
Many years in the game at your request,
You like the rhyme bite if you dare,
I get the paper so I don't care,
Fly that's me the epitome
Of what a real MC is supposed to be,
Fucking you up every time that I drop,
Fuck a bullet baby, I done took your spot
I guide the best and I ride it well

I shall prevail cause I'm next to none
Cause I'm claiming no set, don't plan to get down.

But I'm resting in Studio City for the fun,
If you don't understand just say you don't(nah!)
And don't wait for me to explain cause I won't

I got many witnesses who can back this

Been down with me since Poor Georgie.

Is when I search for the light
Pick up my pen and start to write
I struggle, I fight dark forces in the clear moonlight
Without fear

Insomnia

I can't get no sleep

I used to worry
Thought I was going mad in a hurry
Getting stressed, making excess mess in darkness
No electricity, something's all over me, greasy
Insomnia please release me
And let me dream of making mad love to my girl on the heath
Tearing off tights with my teeth
But there's no release, no peace
I toss and turn without cease
Like a curse, open my eyes and rise like yeast
At least a couple of weeks since I last slept, kept taking sleepers
But now I keep myself pepped
Deeper still, that night
I write by candlelight, I find insight
Fundamental movement, huh, so when it's black
This insomniac, take an original tack
Keep the beast in my nature
Under ceaseless attack

Celeste,"You can reach me by railway, 
You can reach me by trail-way
You can reach me on an airplane, 
You can reach me with your mind

You can reach me by caravan, 
Cross the desert like an Arab man 
I don't care how you get here, 
Just, get here if you can 

You can reach me by sail boat, 
Climb a tree and swing rope to rope
Take a sled and slide down the slope, 
Into these arms of mine

You can jump on a speedy colt, 
Cross the border in a blaze of hope 
I don't care how you get here,
Just, get here if you can

There are hills and mountains between us, 
Always something to get over 
If I had my way, surely you would be closer
I need,
I need you closer 

You can windsurf into my life, 
Take me up on a carpet ride
You can make it in a big balloon,
But you better make it soon 

You can reach me by caravan, 
Cross the desert like an Arab man 
I don't care how you get here,

Celeste,"Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance

A fantabulous night to make romance

I can't wait 'til the morning has come
And I know now the time is just right
And straight in to my arms you will run

And when you come, my heart will be waiting
To make sure that you're never alone
There and then, all my dreams will come true, dear
There and then, I will make you my own

And I know how much you want me that you can't hide

That I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight

The more I see you, 
The more I want you
Somehow this feeling 
Just grows and grows
With every sigh 
I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Right here in the rain you know it just don't seem right
I always go out I never hide but in Cleveland
I should have stayed inside

Your like an old friend 

Come and see me again testify my love
For you I know it runs deep through your body too
From the cold blacktop to the hot concrete

We were far from home but you know it was gonna be alright

Celeste Carballo,"Aprendí a ser formal y cortés
Cortándome el pelo una vez por mes
Y si me aplazó la formalidad
Es que nunca me gustó la sociedad

Vientos del sur o lluvia de abril
Quiero saber dónde debo ir
No quiero estar sin poder crecer
Aprendiendo más lecciones para ser

Y tuve muchos maestros de quien aprender
Pero sólo conocían su ciencia y el deber
Nadie se animó a decir una verdad
Siempre el miedo fue tonto

El tiempo traerá a tu mujer
Una casa nueva y años de aprender
Cómo construir un tiempo de paz
Y tu hijo traerá todo lo demás
él tendrá nuevas respuestas

",Aprendizaje
Celeste Carballo,"¿Qué estás haciendo en New York?
Congelándote los dedos
Trajinando esa ciudad
Toda llena de extranjeros

Ya sé, muy lindo el Central Park
Y los boliches por el Village, arden
Pero después, a quién vas a engatusar
No hay un perro que te ladre

Buenos Aires no tiene la culpa
No me digas que un rencor te hizo huir
Ese dolor, idiotamente, asegurado
Es el candado que no te deja ser feliz

Buenos Aires no tiene la culpa
Distancia el corazón no te va a pedir
Esa canción, y este tango apasionado
Serán soldados que darán su sangre hasta el fin

Mejor, hace un toco y me voy
Curtí Broadway, junta unos mangos
Cúrate pronto, por favor
Y no te pierdas del barrio

Buenos Aires no tiene la culpa
No me digas que un rencor te hizo huir
Ese dolor, idiotamente, asegurado
Es el candado que no te deja ser feliz

Buenos Aires no tiene la culpa
Distancia el corazón no te va a pedir
Esa canción, y este tango alucinado
Serán soldados que darán su sangre hasta el fin

Tal vez buscando algo mejor
Has descuidado tu propio espacio
Sé un héroe andando aquí bajo el sol
Y el mundo vendrá hasta tus manos

En las horas resignadas de tu vida
Gota de vinagre derramada
Fatalmente derramada, sobre todas tus heridas

Fuiste por mi culpa golondrina entre la nieve
Rosa marchitada por la nube que no llueve
Fuimos la esperanza que no llega, que no alcanza
Que no puede vislumbrar su tarde mansa

Fuimos el viajero que no implora, que no reza
Que no llora, que se echó a morir

¡Vete!
¿No comprendes que te estás matando?
¿No comprendes que te estoy llamando?
¡Vete!
No me beses que te estoy llorando
Y quisiera no llorarte más

¿No ves?
Es mejor que mi dolor
Quede tirado con tu amor
Librado de mi amor final

¡Vete!
¿No comprendes que te estoy salvando?
¿No comprendes que te estoy amando?
No me sigas, ni me llames, ni me beses
Ni me llores, ni me quieras más

Fuimos abrazados a la angustia de un presagio
Por la noche de un camino sin salidas
Pálidos despojos de un naufragio
Sacudidos por las olas del amor y de la vida

Fuimos empujados en un viento desolado
Sombras de una sombra que tornaba del pasado
Fuimos la esperanza que no llega, que no alcanza
Que no puede vislumbrar su tarde mansa

Fuimos el viajero que no implora, que no reza
Que no llora, que se echó a morir

¡Vete!
¿No comprendes que te estás matando?

Celestial Image,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear
Celestial Navigations,"I'm going home. 
It's time for me to go home.
Not to the farm with snow all around, 
The smells of food filling the house while we sit by the fire. 
Not to the mountains, where I can look across the valley to the jagged peaks, silent in the morning. Not to the seaside village, standing on the dock 
Watching a fishing boat sailing off in the misty morning.
I'm going to my home across the sky. 
Every night I stand here on the 
Earth and point to a star. 
On that star is a carriage, waiting outside the gates to the city. 
It arrives every day at three o'clock in the afternoon drawn by two horses. 
And when the sun goes down it leaves, empty.
This ritual has been going on for many, many, many years. That carriage waits for me. 
And on the day I arrive back on that star, 
I will climb into it and gallop away from the city across the blue hills to where the trees end. There, at the edge of time, is a cabin made of white wood facing the other side of the sky.
I'm going home.",Home

until the end of time
you're all I need, my love, my valentine

I have been waiting for
all you give to me
you've opened my eyes
and showed me how to love unselfishly

I've dreamed of this a thousand times before
but in my dreams I couldn't love you more

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

No need for greed or hunger

Qué desconsuelo brutal
Qué ganas de echarme en el suelo
Y ponerme a llorar

Cansa', de ver la vida que siempre se burla
Y hace pedazos mi canto y mi fe
La vida es tumba de ensueños
Con luces que abiertas preguntan pa' qué
Pensar que en mi niñez tanto ambicioné
Que al soñar forjé tanta ilusión

Oigo a mi madre aún, la oigo engañándome
Porque la vida me negó las esperanzas
Que en la cuna me cantó,
Pero ansia'o sólo alcancé un amor
Y cuando lo alcancé me traicionó

Me traicionaste otra vez (me traicionó)
Tú por una me olvidaste (me traicionó)
Yo por nadie te olvidé (me traicionó)
Buscaste quien te quisiera (me traicionó)
Yo sin buscar encontré (me traicionó, me traicionó)

Yo soy como el oro viejo (me traicionó)

Se aproxima otro mejor (me traicionó)

Seeing the great ones, in my heart untold

We saw arsenio with his singing bandit
And señor rodríguez, that magical man
I took this earthquake to el barrio,  
That hot and from mi gente 

Lucky me, I saw my tito
Ay dios mío, el excelente
Listening to my machito, dancing, drinking vino
Machito was for us el latino

He made it up in
It didn't disappoint our 
At the ball, with tito puento
Tito puento the king of them all

With tito puente, you'd be so glad to dance
El rey tito puente, at a glance
When tito finished playing
How could anything feel so low

Surprise came tito rodríguez
With his conjunto, to top it all
Bere to tito, that only one
Better  for dancing the only one

El señor me dio la dicha (negra)
Con tito puente y cantar con tito rodríguez 
(esa dicha me la dio el señor)
Ven a gozar con la dicha, a gozar con la dicha
(esa dicha me la dio el señor)

(esa dicha me la dio el señor)
Ay yo le canto
(esa dicha me la dio el señor)
Y al que dios se lo dio san pedro se lo bendiga",La Dicha Mia

Solo me importa mi mujer

Y pienses lo que dije ayer

A mi siempre me toca perder

Será la música de fondo de lo mucho que sentí

Cuando me fui buscando el cielo de la libertad 
Cuántos amigos que dejé y cuántas lagrimas lloré 
Yo viviré, para volverlos a encontrar

Bailando música caliente como bailo yo 
Y cuando suene una guaracha 
Y cuando suene un huahuancó

Porque yo soy como soy ,asi me hicieron mar y
Candela para cantarle al mundo

Al mundo entero yo le canto
Con alegria y sentimiento

Porque yo soy como soy, asi me hicieron mar y
Candela para cantarle al mundo

Contigo canto con placer
Siento que vuelvo a nacer

Ay Celia que sabroso es el mambo
Azucar, azucar

Dime Celia, como es que se llega

Con profesionalismo, creyendo en uno mismo
Siendo como tu eres con humildad

Dime Celia como es que se llega

No dejes que la fama, se te suba a la cabeza
Se siempre original, nunca vayas a cambiar, uh

La princesa que es La India
Y la reyna que soy, yo okay

Sube por aqui
Sube por aqui, dobla por alla

Por donde?

Quedate arriba
Mantente firme, debes oirme

Tienes que estar en control
Controlate, ten control control
Quedate arriba

Con sacrificio y trabajo, en ti tienes que creer
No te dejes caer

Cuando me invitaste a cantar contigo
Con mucho gusto acepté y ahora tú
Y yó estamos cantando al mundo
Y a todos los que sienten, rumba buena y guaguancó

El primero de esos días

Mejor me voy 
Hay dos días en mi vida 
El primero fue muy bueno 
Y el segundo 

Me tragué todo el verano 
El que llevaban tu besos 
Me empapé del sufrimiento 
Que escondía tu sonrisa 

Descubrí con el tiempo 
Me perdí todo el respeto 
Comparaste mis sentimientos 
Con tus labios de carmín 

En tus labios me perdí 
Me engañaste

Celia Cruz,"Por si acaso no regreso
Yo me llevo tu bandera
Lamentando que mis ojos
Liberada no te vieran

Porque tuve que marcharme
Todos pueden comprender
Yo pensé que en cualquer momento
A tu suelo iba a volver

Pero el tiempo va pasando
Y tu sol sigue llorando
Las cadenas siguen atando
Pero yo sigo esperando y al cielo rezando

Y siempre me sentí dichosa
De haber nacido entre tus brazos y anunque
Ya no esté de mi corazón te dejo un pedazo
Por si acaso, por si acaso no regreso

Pronto llegará el momento
Que se borre el sufrimiento
Guardaremos los rencores, Dios mío
Y compartiremos todos, un mismo sentimiento

Aunque el tiempo haya pasado
Con orgullo y dignidad
Tu nombre lo he llevado, a todo mundo
Entero le he contado tu verdad

Pero, tierra ya no sufras
Corazón no te quebrantes
No hay mal que dure cien años
Ni mi cuerpo que aguante

Y nunca quize abandonarte
Te llevaba en cada paso y quedará mi amor
Para siempre como flor de un regazo
Por si acaso, por si acaso no regreso

Si acaso no regreso
Me matará el dolor
Y si no vuelvo a mi tierra
Me muero de dolor

Si acaso no regreso
Me matará el dolor
A esa tierra yo la adoro
Con todo el corazón

Si acaso no regreso
Me matará el dolor
Tierra mía, tierra linda
Te quiero con amor

Si acaso no regreso
Me matará el dolor
Tanto tiempo sin verla
Me duele el corazón

Si acaso no regreso
Cuando me muera
Que en mi tumba
Pongan mi bandera

Si acaso no regreso
Y que me entierren
Con la música
De mi tierra querida

Si acaso no regreso
Si no regreso recuerden
Que la quise con mi vida

Si acaso no regreso
Ay, me muero de dolor
Me estoy muriendo ya

Me matará el dolor
Me matará el dolor
Me matará el dolor

Ay, ya me está matando ese dolor
Me matará el dolor
Siempre te quise y te querré

Me matará el dolor
Me matará el dolor
Me matará el dolor
Me matará el dolor

Si no regreso a esa tierra
Me duele el corazón

Celia Cruz,"Quítate de ahí, no te lo repito
Desde hace tiempo tú puesto se ocupó
Por esa puerta no entrarás te lo aseguro
No insistas más que no te voy a perdonar

Pronto llegará, no debe encontrarte
Ese disgusto no se lo puedo dar
Él ya conoce la historia de mi pasado
Si no te marchas lo vas a lamentar

En mi corazón tan sólo quedan escombros
De lo que fue tu amor
Tanto yo sufrí, que ahora que soy tan dichosa
No te soporto frente a mí

Quítate de ahí, no te lo repito

Por esa puerta no entrarás te lo aseguro

Estaba llena la marquesina
Igual estaba el balcón
Y una fila en la cocina
Esperándo aquel sopón

Aquella fiesta tenía de todo
Música para bailar
Y llegó Píenealo y puso
A gosar a la gente

Celia Cruz,"Estas son las cosas que le pasan a uno
Uno busca lleno de esperanzas
El camino que los sueños
Prometieron a sus ansias

Sabe que la lucha es cruel y es mucha
Pero lucha y se desangra
Por la fe que lo empecina

Uno va arrastrándose entre espinas
Y en su afán de dar su amor
Sufre y se destroza, hasta entender
Que uno se ha quedao sin corazón

Precio de castigo que uno entrega
Por un beso que no llega
O un amor que lo engañó
Vacío ya de amar y de llorar tanta traición

Si yo tuviera el corazón
El corazón que di
Si yo pudiera, como ayer
Querer sin presentir

Es posible que a tus ojos
Que me gritan su cariño
Los cerrara con mis besos
Sin pensar que eran como esos
Otros ojos, los perversos
Los que hundieron mi vivir

Si yo tuviera el corazón
El mismo que perdí
Si olvidara a aquel que ayer
Lo destrozó y pudiera amarte
Me abrazaría a tu ilusión
Para llorar tu amor

(Mi corazón ya lo perdí)
(Perdí por dártelo a ti)
Te lo di y no lo merecías
Por eso estoy así

(Mi corazón ya lo perdí)
(Perdí por dártelo a ti)
Uno se enamora
Después uno llora

(Mi corazón ya lo perdí)
(Perdí por dártelo a ti)
Si yo tuviera el corazón que perdí
No volvería a darlo así

(Devuélvemelo)
Devuélvemelo
(Devuélvelo)
El corazón
(Devuélvemelo)
Tráemelo completico
(Devuélvelo)
No me lo traigas a pedacitos

Ay, devuélvemelo
(Devuélvelo)
No te lo lleves pa' allá
(Devuélvemelo)
Tráelo para acá

Ay, devuélvemelo

Si olvidara a aquel que ayer
Lo destrozó y pudiera amarte
Me abrazaría a tu ilusión
Para llorar tu amor

cualquier soledad
sin que la pueda controlar

por los caminos mas lejanos
por los sueños que soñe
sera el reflejo del amor de lo que me toco vivir
sera la musica de fondo de lo mucho que senti

cuando me fui buscando el cielo de la libertad
cuantos amigos que deje 
y cuantas lagrimas llore
y hoy vivire para volverlos a encontrar

Y seguire con mi cancion
bailando musica caliente como bailo yo
y cuando suene una huaracha y cuando suene un huahuanco
en la sangre de mi pueblo en su cuerpo estare yo

Que la vida lo trata mal

Grandioso de la amistad

Y que critica por criticar ya s hora que se

Despierten porque muy solos se quedaran

Subir y para llegar no crea que engaña
A nadie que en su mentira el se hundirá

Viviendo de mal humor no se llega
A nada cambia la cara de amargao cambia esa cara

No creas que con dinero puedas compra
La felicidad hay gente que lo tiene
Todo y acaba solo en la soledad

Viviendo de mal humor no se llega

Cambia esa cara de amargao

Cambia esa cara para que luzcas

Sacó provecho de mí, abusó
Sacó partido de mí abusó
De mi cariño usted abusó

Y me perdona, por seguir con este tema
Yo no sé escribir poema ni tampoco una canción
Sin un tema de amor

Cada palabra cada verso me recuerda
El momento que mi amor se te entregó
Que mi amor se te entregó y usted abusó

Usted abusó
De mí cariño usted abusó
Sacó partido de mí abusó
Sacó provecho de mí, abusó

Y fue mi mal, me destruyó el desamor
Su gran escuela del dolor
Ya no sé si lo maldice o lo bendice el corazón

Cada palabra cada verso me recuerda
El momento que mi amor se te entregó
Cuando te entregué mi amor y usted abusó

Y fue mi mal por que jamás en mi creyó
Y usted sacó provecho de mi abusó
Y me perdona por quererle, tanto, tanto, tanto
Y por eso mismo usted sacó provecho de mi abusó

No, no, no sé si lo maldice o lo bendice mi corazón
Por que, usted sacó provecho de mí, abusó
Yo no sé lo que pasó, que usted de mi se burló
De mi cariño usted, se burló, me dejó, se rió

Por eso ahora ya yo no vuelvo a querer
Sacó provecho de mí, abusó
Abusó de mí cariño, abusó de mí cariño
Ay de mi cariño usted se burló
De mi también abusó, consuélate como yo

He aprendido que en la vida
En amor todo es mentira
Y usted, saco provecho de mi, abuso
De mi cariño usted, se burló, me dejó, se rió

Dentro de mí la guaracha
Me prendía el corazón
Cuando tocaban tambores

Y luego al pasar el tiempo
Mi sentimiento sonero
Se apoderó de mi vida
Y dije eso es lo que quiero

Y así comenzó señores
El gran amor por la rumba
Y sólo podrá la rumba
Arrancarme de mi son

Pues llevo en el corazón
Como una llama candente
Que quema para mi gente
El fruto de su folklore

Y soy rumbera de antaño
Rumbera soy del presente
Porque al pasar de los años
Sigue la rumba en mi mente

Si hay ritmo en el corazón
La música es para siempre
Si hay ritmo en el corazón
La música es para siempre

(Si hay ritmo en el corazón)
(La música es para siempre)
Y ya desde chiquitita me inspiró la rumba
Y entré en el ambiente

(Si hay ritmo en el corazón)
(La música es para siempre)
La sigo cantando ahora en el presente
Porque mi rumbita la pide la gente

(Si hay ritmo en el corazón)
(La música es para siempre)

Sentí ese ritmo con emoción

Por un poquito de tiempo que de ti me separé 
me tracionaste, Macusa, ¡Qué triste yo me quedé! 

Me devolviste el retrato que en prueba de amor yo te di 
y me pediste tus cartas, en ellas decías así
""Te quiero mi cuchumbito, tú nunca me hagas sufrir""

Yo nunca usé la corbata, ni tampoco usé el pañuelo 
creyendo que así guardado conservaría el recuerdo

Las trazas se dieron cuenta que todo iba a ser traición 
se metieron en el cofre donde guardé mi pasión
destruyendo los recuerdos del engaño de un amor

¡Como yo te quise a ti, Macusa, nadie te querrá! 
¡Nadie, pero nadie, te querrá!

Y fui como todo el mundo a ver al doctor
Y cuando me tomó el pulso, el médico se extrañó
Con cara de preocupado me examinó

Me dijo, no reconozco tales sonidos
Que suenan como maracas
Clave y bongó y yo le dije riendo
Doctor lo que usted está oyendo
Es el sonido del son de mi corazón

Yo llevo el son en el corazón
A mí me suena el son en el corazón
Y es que es por el son
Que tiene razón de vivir latiendo mi corazón

Doctor, si chequea mi sangre no se me asombre
Con los niveles de azúcar, que en mi es normal
Recuerde que soy oriunda de la tierra más fecunda
Y por las venas me corre un cañaveral

Y en mi garganta oirá cantar al sinsonte
Y escuchará en mi garganta brisas del mar
También llevo en las caderas
El vaivén de las palmeras
Y llevo en la piel la noche tropical

Y es que yo llevo el son
En el corazón

Habla con la botella

Entonces vuelve a taparla
Y no te la quites más

No estés amargao, no, no
No estés amargao
No estés amargao, no

Si un día te levantas triste
Tiene fácil solución
Ay, date la media vuelta
Y métete en el colchón

No hay que levantarse triste
Es malo pa' la salud
Hazle caso a esta negrita
Tu negrita Celia cruz

Qué chivirí, qué chivirón
Qué chivirí, qué chivirón
Qué chivirí, qué chivirón

Para sentirse muy bien
Una copita de vino
Ay, la comida de mamá
Y un abracito latino

Si lloras échate a reír
Ríete si estás llorando
Porque esta vida mi gente
Prontito se va pasando

No estés amargao, no, no
No estés amargao
No estés amargao, no
No estés amargao

Qué chivirí, qué chivirón
Qué chivirí, qué chivirón
Qué chivirí, qué chivirón

I may go wrong and lose my way
Do you know the way to San Jose

Put a hundred down and buy a car

How quick they pass
And all the stars that never were
Are parking cars and pumping gas

They've got a lot of space
There'll be a place where I can stay
I was born and raised in San Jose
I'm going back to find some peace of mind in San Jose

Fame and fortune is a magnet
It can pull you far away from home
With a dream in your heart you're never alone

Dreams turn into dust and blow away
And there you are without a friend
You pack your car and ride away

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

But baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Celia Cruz,"Mi Gente

Mi gente ¡Ustedes!
Lo más grande de este mundo
Siempre me hacen sentir
Un orgullo profundo

Los llamé ¡vengan conmigo
No me preguntaron dónde
Orgullo tengo de ustedes
Mi gente siempre responde

Vinieron todos para oirme guarachar
Pero como soy de ustedes
Yo los invitaré a cantar
Conmigo sí van a bailar
Yo los invitaré a gozar conmigo sí

Que cante mi gente

Celia Cruz,"Las caras lindas de mi gente negra 
Son un desfile de melaza en flor 
Que cuando pasa frente a mí se alegra 
De su negrura, todo el corazón

Las caras lindas de mi raza prieta 
Tienen de llanto, de pena y dolor 
Son las verdades, que la vida reta 
Pero que llevan dentro mucho amor

Somos la melaza que ríe 
La melaza que llora, 
Somos la melaza que ama 
Y en cada beso, es conmovedora

Por eso vivo orgulloso de su colorido 
Somos betún amable, de clara poesía 
Tienen su ritmo, tienen melodía 
Las caras lindas de mi gente negra

Las caras lindas, las caras lindas 
Las caras lindas de mi gente negra

Qué lindas, pero, pero mira, qué lindas son

Tienen, tienen, tienen, tienen de llanto 
Mucha melodía, te digo belén tienen belleza 
Y también tienen poesía de la bien linda

Caritas lindas de gente negra, 
Que en la calma tengo un montón 
Las caras lindas de mi gente negra, son un vacilón

Somos, te digo, la melaza que ríe, 
Que canta y que llora y en cada beso 
Bien conmovedora y cautivadora

Te digo que en porto bello panamá 
Yo vi la cara más bella y pura 
Y es por eso que mi corazón, 
Se alegra de su negrura 
Esa si que es linda!

Que lin, que lin, que lindas son 
Negrura de la pura 
Que lin, que lin, que lindas son

Óyeme, pero que bonitas son, lindas son, 
Chulas son, bonitas son, lindas que son 
Lindas como tú veras, así son

Lindas como aquellas que dije son un vacilón 
Un riquito vacilón, con tu corazón, rico de melón

Que lindas, que lindas, que lindas, que lindas 
Que chulas que son, bonitas que son, bien bonitas 
Chulitas que son, que lindas son, caritas lindas, 
Lindas, lindas son ¡llévame! 
Lindas que son, lindas son

Pero que lindas son, pero que lindas son, 
Lindas que son, lindas son

Muchas caras lindas, 
Pero que lin, que lin, que lindas son

Roco toco tin pero que lindas 
Que lindas son, 
Las caras lindas de mi gente negra, son un montón

Desfile de negrura, 
De la pura que viene de allá bajo 
Las caras lindas de mi gente negra son un vacilón.

Melaza que ríe, melaza que ríe, 
Ay, que canta y que llora, 
Y en cada beso bien conmovedora

Pero que linda",Las Caras Lindas

Sacó partido de mí abusó

te vas a arrepentir

que si te engañan duele 

oye mira y después vendrás a mí, 
pidiéndome perdón

The night that I won't forget
You've seen what I've been waiting for
But baby, I've been wrong before

You held me tight
And everything seemed just right
I couldn't ask for more
But baby, I've been wrong before

She used to smile at me
And hold my hand like you do
Then she left me
And broke my heart in two

See her face
And feel your warm embrace

Oh baby, I've been wrong before",I've Been Wrong Before
Celia La,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Celia Lipton,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April
Celia Lipton,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street

Right through the very heart of it

I wanna wake up in a city that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap

If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere

Hear a way we die.
You can make the mountains ring,
Hear the angels cry.
Tho' the dove is on the wing
You need not know why.

Hey, people now,
Smile on your brother.
Let me see you get together,
Love one another right now.

Some will come and some will go,
We shall surely pass.
When the wind that left us here,
Returns for us at last.
We are but a moment's sunlight,
Fading on the grass.

Hey, people now,
Smile on your brother.
Let me see you get together,
Love one another right now.

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief

Yes I need her in the daytime
Yes I need her in the night
Yes I want to throw my arms around her
Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight

She gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day
Yes it makes me righteous, yes it makes me feel whole
Yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul",Crazy Love

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee
Celine Dion,"The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling like thunder now
As I look in your eyes

I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear
Suddenly the feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

'Cause I'm your lady And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love",The Power of Love [*]
Celine Dion,"Lying in bed alone
Thinkin' bout how much I need you
Oh give me one more chance 
To see you again

If only I'd have known 
Was the last time I'd be with you
I would have held on 
And never let you go

Baby, just have a heart
I'm begging you
Let me show you
How much I need you

Baby, just have a heart
This much is true 
I miss your touch
I'm still in love with you

Here comes another day
I don't know if I can make it
Oh, I've just realized 
Its so lonely being free

Runnin' from the pain
I'm never gonna shake it
Oh how I need you
To take it from me, baby

Baby just have a heart
I'm beggin' you
Let me show you 
How much I need you

Baby just have a heart
This much is true
I miss your touch
I'm still in love with you

I always thought that I would have the
Upper hand, but now I know that I'm 
Really not that strong
If I could only make you understand
I'd give you the world
But for a start

Baby just have a heart",Have a Heart
Celine Dion,"just wanted you to talk to me 
But baby you captured my heart so easy 
And I know love, baby when I see it 
Boy when you're near me that's the 
Feeling I get 

It's pure emotion inside of me 
And all I know is I feel

Too much, too much baby all I do is think 
About you night and day I feel too
Too much, too much baby don't let go 'cause 
It's my heart you're takin' 

The spell that I'm under I can't undo 
But baby I wonder do you feel it too 

A classic case of infatuation 
Is it possible that I feel

It's a serious connection when I look into your eyes 
When you show me your affection, it's more than I realized",I Feel Too Much
Celine Dion,"Do you realize how long it's been 
Where does all my time with you go? 
And all the memories 
We shared as friends 
Reflected, in my heart 
Is where they show 

I'm loving every moment with you 
I'm living in a dream that's comin' true 
I'm lost in everything you do 
I love you 
I'm saving every moment for you 
You're hidden in a place that's safe and true 
Lovin' everything we do 

With every second 
You hold me near 
I'm closer to a place I want to be 
To hear you whisper 
But no one else can hear 
I want your love 
To stay forever, inside of me 

In our silence 
Looking in your eyes 
I hear words you don't need to say 
Just hold on Baby 
'Cause it's reason, I'm prayin' 
You feel what I feel 
In every way",I'm Loving Every Moment With You
Celine Dion,"You bought me flowers and you sold me a line
You gave me compliments and too much wine
I've played that game, I know all the moves

You show emotion but you hide what you feel
You play the innocent but I've watched you steal
I rest my case, you stand accused

But I must confess I was quite impressed
You seduced me with your easy charm
And I must admit I could fall for it

But if love is out of the question
There's no point to this affection
I gotta have more than ecstasy
Make me believe
I'm all you'll ever need, make me believe
'Cause if love is out of the question
Put a little heart in your intention
I gotta have more than ecstasy
Make me believe
I'm all you'll ever need

You talk in circles when I need a straight line
You've got your principles and I've got mine
We all need commitment that's all I ask
Is that a crime?

And I must confess I was quite impressed
I was losing to your winning ways
But I must resist there's no point to this

But if love is out of the question
There's no point to this affection
I gotta have more than ecstasy
Make me believe
I'm all you'll ever need

'Cause if love is out of the question I just gotta stop
Little point to this affection I just want to stop
It makes no sense to carry on like this
If there's nothing between us you don't know what you'll miss

No love
There's no love
Baby it's true
There's no love

But if love is out of the question
There's no point to this affection
'Cause if love is out the question
Put a little heart in your intention

But if love is out of the question
There's no point to this affection

Put a little heart in your intention",If Love Is Out of the Question
Celine Dion,"I never found out why you walked away
And never said good-bye
But now that I see you
I'm torn inside, but I've still got my pride

I understand that some things are better left unsaid
I'm afraid of the truth
But what can I do if I still want you

If we could start over again
I know if we try our love could be stronger
If we could start over again
I'm sure, we oh
We'd never have to let go

For so many years now
I've held inside things I meant to say
But faced with the past now I realize
I can't let that stand in our way

I never knew that a love so strong would never fade
But what can we do
If I still want you
And you want me too

How can we walk away
From something that was once so strong
Have we the strength to say we're wrong",If We Could Start Over
Celine Dion,"Let me be the first to say
Ain't it always so? 
But there's no other way to find out 
What I need to know 
It's not that I don't think you care 
It's what you haven't said 
That keeps me guessing day and night 
Putting visions in my head 

Don't let me be the last 
If you thought of leaving would you tell me? 
Don't let me be the last 
If the truth would hurt me would you lie? 
Don't you keep it to yourself for my protection 
Break it to me now 
Don't let me be the last 
If there's anything you want to tell me 
Don't let me be the last 
Like you're never gonna let me go 
Baby, all I ask 
Don't let me be the last to know 

You know how a friend will talk 
A secret's hard to keep 
But this girl she says you're seeing 
Sure sounds a lot like me 
Still it's not for me to say 
If what I heard is true 
And I won't let myself believe a word 
Till I hear it from you",The Last to Know
Celine Dion,"Somewhere past midnight 
When the moment is just right 
We ride the streets of desire 
We take it slow and 
Always get where we're goin' 
'Cause where there's smoke there's a fire 

There's no denying 
We don't need to keep trying 
Let's face the music and dance 

Well it's all semantic 
What we never say 
But what we feel ain't goin' away

So I wonder, how could we be feeling 
More than this 
Tell me true 
What it is, 'cause 

Something has to make us feel this way 
Love by another name 
Doesn't matter 'cause it's still the same love 
Won't depend upon the words we say 
Love by another name 
Something happens when we're making love 

Si ce n'est pas l'amour 
Qu'est-ce que c'est? 

We're superstitious 
When every day is like Christmas 
No promise spoken 
Hearts don't have to get broken 
More than a four letter word 

If we're just pretending 
We can write a new ending 
If we don't like where it leads 

Well it's new romantic 
Action over words 
The sweetest nothings that I've heard 

I can't tell you everything I'm feeling 
More than this 
Do you know 
What it is, 'cause 

I know that I can't describe 
What I'm feeling inside 
Maybe I'll learn 
I guess I live with the fear 
This could all disappear 
If I try to put it in words",Love by Another Name
Celine Dion,"Somewhere tonight, we come alive
Two hearts ignite, we're one of a kind 
Here we are, undivided by no-one
Else but you and I 
Come so far, no one else can ever 
Steal away what we confide

Who wants to know

[Chorus]
We stick together, we're never apart
Everybody knows who we are
Cause we are one, we do it in unison

Gleam of an eye, flash of a smile
Never too shy, playing ever so wild
Here we are, I'm relying on, no-one else 
But you and I, come so far, no-one else can ever
Steal away what we confide

Why I walked away
I know you thought you were so good to me
I didn't see it that way
My love's not something you can buy and sell
Like pearls on a string
And if you want to know where we went wrong
You ought to stop and think

Did you give enough love? Did you show that you cared?
When I needed understanding were you really there?
Whenever I was down did you try to pick me up?
Maybe you should ask yourself
Did you give enough love?

Good intentions you know I had
Right from the start
But if you wonder why we didn't last
Just look inside your heart

Did you give enough love? Did you show that you cared?
When I needed understanding were you really there?
Whenever I was down did you try to pick me up?
Maybe you should ask yourself
Did you give enough love?

Did you give enough time, when I was alone
When I needed you there to make me feel I belonged
You just don't know what you did to me
I just had to be free

Did ya, did ya, did ya give enough
Did ya, did ya, did ya give enough

Wherever I am I want you to be
Walking with your hand in mine
Feel so fine

When I'm close to you
I know what it means to want to be true
Never felt this way before
Is there more

Are you feeling the same as me honestly
Don't you think it's unreal
I'm not dealing in fairy tales
If this fails
I don't know what on earth I will do 'cause I'm
Halfway to heaven
Let's go all the way
I don't want to give it up
'Cause I'm already falling in love

When we reach that place
I'm dying to see the smile on your face
I'm so sure you'll want to stay
That's okay

I have so many dreams to share
Please be there
Let me share them with you

The one who could give you love
The kind of love you really need

That I'll always stay with you
But baby that's not me
You need someone willing to give their heart and soul to you
Promise you forever, baby that's something I can't do

Oh I could say that I'll be all you need
But that would be a lie
I know I'd only hurt you
I know I'd only make you cry

I'm not the one you're needing
I love you, goodbye

I hope someday you can 
Find some way to understand I'm only doing this for you
I don't really want to go
But deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do

You'll find someone who'll be the one that I could never be
Who'll give you something better
Than the love you'll find with me
Oh I could say that I'll be all you need

But that would be a crime
I know I'd only hurt you
I know I'd only make you cry
I'm not the one you're needing
I love you, goodbye

Leaving someone when you love someone
Is the hardest thing to do
When you love someone as much as I love you

Oh I don't want to leave you
Baby it tears me up inside
But I'll never be the one you're needing
I love you, goodbye

Baby, its never goin' work out

Drifting far away
But she can't see through

Show her that you're sure

If I were you

Celine Dion,"Used to be that I believed in something
Used to be that I believed in love
It's been a long time since I've had that feeling
I could love someone
I could trust someone
I said I'd never let nobody near my heart again, darlin'
I said I'd never let nobody in

But if you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life, forever
If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever
If you asked me to
If you asked me to

Somehow ever since I've been around you
Can't go back to being on my own
Can't help feeling, darlin', since I've found you
That I've found my home
That I'm finally home
I said I'd never let nobody get too close to me, darlin'
I said I needed, needed to be free

(But if you asked me to)

Ask me to, I will give my world to you baby

Celine Dion,"Here they come
Every night the same
Silent stars
Light from a distant flame
Just like the memories of you
That I hold inside
I see you touch
But all the warmth has died

Empty rooms
Crowded by the past 
Time is my enemy
Days keep moving faster
But the nights alone can be
An eternity
That never heals the scars
Of foolish pride

If only you could see me now
Goodbye is not so easy now
The freedom that I walked away to gain
Is nothing but these chains
That you alone can break
And you would free me now
Your heart would come undone
Just looking at me once
And my love would bring you back
If only you could see me now

Here I am
Stranger to a smile
Trying to fight the tears
Missing by a mile
I'm not the one who laughed at you
On that yesterday
When you warned me not to throw your love away

If you could only see me now
Goodbye is not so easy now
The freedom that I walked away to gain
Is nothing but these chains
I know your heart would break 
If you could hear me now
Your heart would come undone
If you could hear me once
Hoping love will bring you back
If only you could see me now

You see above
That sails the dark alone
Forever
I have no light of my own
Other the love we've known
So long ago

Celine Dion,"I've been over you for some time now baby
I don't miss your kiss like before now anymore
If you ask me how I'm doing I'm fine
All I needed was a little time
So if you think that I still need you baby
I really don't know why

Oh baby since you left me
You might think that my world's been torn apart
But if you see me
Baby you'll see that
Nothings broken, nothing broken but my heart

You won't find no tears in my eyes now baby
If you think I'm sad that you're gone now
Then you're wrong now
If you ask I'll say that I'm happy
I'm free
Tell you that's the way I want to be
And all those nights we shared together baby
Well they don't mean a thing

Oh baby since you left me
You might think that my world's been torn apart
But if you see me
Baby you'll see that
Nothings broken, nothing broken but my heart

Oh baby, you might think my world's been torn apart
Oh but you'll see that
Nothings broken, nothing broken but my heart

So if you think that I still need you baby
I don't think about you
I'm happy now without you

Oh baby since you left me
You might think that my world's been torn apart
But if you see me
Baby you'll see that

Celine Dion,"I've tried my best for so long
To break down these walls
But you build them strong
So I stand here waiting, wondering why
Oh why

Why you don't give a little bit
Break down and give a little bit

Show, show some emotion
Open, open your heart, ooh
Set free an ocean
Only a feeling can save us now

You say you've been hurt
Well you're not alone
As you race through this life what you
Keep to yourself
Can turn you to stone
All it would take is one kind word
To be heard

Come on and give a little bit
Try to forgive a little bit
Show some emotion
Open, open your heart
Set free an ocean
Only a feeling can save us now

I thee want
I long for you to talk to me like you did
That night in the restaurant

you spoke of love so openly
And again and again you promised me
That you'd never leave
But now you're gone

With this voice
I thee call
Sometimes I catch myself
Calling your name
When you're not there at all

Please tell me what I did wrong
Why must I hear your voice inside my head
All day and all night long
It's not fair

With these arms
I held you
When you told me you were dying
I had less courage it's true
And you wrote every day
Writing 'bout the things
That we could do
When your pain went away
But all that went away was you

Wear your party dress 
Maybe I was just an innocent

I never even knew the song

Celine Dion,"I'll paint my mood in shades of blue 
Paint my soul to be with you 
I'll sketch your lips in shaded tones 
Draw your mouth to my own 

I'll draw your arms around my waist 
Then all doubt I shall erase 
I'll paint the rain that softly lands on your wind blown hair 

I'll trace a hand to wipe out your tears 
A look to calm your fears 
A silhouette of dark and light 
While we hold each other oh so tight 

I'll paint a sun to warm your heart 
Swearing that we'll never part 
That's the color of my love 

I'll paint the truth 
Show how I feel 
Try to make you completely real 
I'll use a brush so light and fine 
To draw you close and make you mine

That boy is gonna hurt you
His kind of love is not for real
He's only playin'
Fooling with your heart girl
But I know how he makes me feel
And I don't need any other proof
They just don't understand
They don't know the truth

Momma says he's bad for me
Papa says I'll be sorry
Everybody's talkin' my baby down
And all my friends doubt him
Tell me I should live without him

He's not like all the others
Nobody wants to see it
They don't even want to try
Judge a book by it's cover
And you'll never know the story
There's so much more than meets the eye
Oh and I know his heart is true
I don't need anyone
To tell me what to do

Celine Dion,"I remember L.A. 
Seems a lifetime ago 
We were stars on Sunset Boulevard 
What a movie we made 

There were days in the sun 
That have stayed forever young 
Nights when passion was invincible 
We thought love would never die 

[Chorus] 

There were moments in that lifetime 
That my heart still replays 
There were minutes  there were hours  there were days 
There are moments I still love you that same way 
When I remember L.A. 

I remember goodbye 
I watched your plane out of sight 
Love was over, time to close the book 
Still I go back for one last look 

[Chorus]",I Remember L.A.
Celine Dion,"[Chorus]
Love doesn't ask why
It speaks from the heart
And never explains
Don't you know that
Love doesn't think twice
It can come all at once
Or whisper from a distance

Don't ask me if this feeling's right or wrong
It doesn't have to make much sense
It just has to be this strong
'Cause when you're in my arms I understand
We don't try to have a voice
When our hearts make the choices
There's no plan
It's in our hands

[Chorus]

Now I can feel what you're afraid to say
If you give your soul to me
Will you give too much away
We can't let this moment pass us by
Can't question this chance
Or expect any answers
We can try
But love doesn't ask you why

So let's take what we found
And wrap it around us

[Chorus]

Love doesn't ask why",Love Doesn't Ask Why
Celine Dion,"I listen to the sound of the rain fallin' down my window 
Prayin' for a gentle wind 
To bring my baby back again 
Tryin' to be strong but I'm not getting any stronger 
Loneliness is tearing apart this heart of mine 
I lay awake 'cuz I can't take another night lonely 
It's been too long  I can't hold on no more 

Leavin' on the next plane out 
'Cuz I gotta see my baby 
It's been too long since I held him in my arms 
And I just won't sleep at night 
Till he's sleeping here beside me 
Here beside me again 
Gotta be with my baby 

Talking on the phone but that don't make it any better 
Nothing's gonna ease this pain 
Until I'm in his arms again 
Runnin' down the stairs there's a taxi that's waiting for me 
Loneliness I'm gonna leave you far behind 
I'd walk for days through pouring rain 
Anything to be with him 
It's been so long, I can't be strong no more 

Leavin' on the next plane out 
'Cuz I gotta see my baby 
It's been too long since I held him in my arms 
And I just won't sleep at night 
Till he's sleeping here beside me

Gotta be by his side

This world would still be spinnin' 'round 
But baby there would be

How could I ever survive 
Just no living without loving you 
It would be like living without being alive without you

What would there be left to do now 
What would I be without you now

Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now
As I look in your eyes

I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you

Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear
Suddenly the feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

Deux doigts sur un piano
Ce vieux piano a bon dos

C'est sur les touches blanches
Que je range

Ne sait plus où il va
Il pleure ou bien il rit

Comme en France en boheme ou en Chine
On a plein de forets de jardins devant nous
En amour
Comme dans un avion qui dessine
Un grand coeur tout autour de nous

Je decouvre des planetes et des horizons
Des etoiles inconnues qui ont toutes le nom
De celui partage avec moi sa route et ses chansons
Et je plane je plane je plane et je suis

En amour
Comme on dit do cote de chez nous
J'ai envie de partir avec lui n'importe ou
En amour
Comme on va de pays en pays
Sur le dos d'un nuage fou

En amour
Comme en France en boheme ou en Chine
On a plein de forets de jardins devant nous
En amour
Avec le monde entier qui dessine
Un grand coeur tout autour de nous
Tout autour de nous

En amour
Comme on dit do cote de chez nous
J'ai envie de partir avec lui n'importe ou
En amour
Comme on va de pays en pays
Sur le dos d'un nuage fou
En amour
Comme en France en boheme ou en Chine
On a plein de forets de jardins devant nous",En Amour
Celine Dion,"Si see'est un ami, s'il est pour toi ce que tu es pour lui 
Celui qui peut t'aimer, sans jamais te juger 
Celui qui reste quand les autres t'ont déjà quitté 
Je dis que si, see'est un ami 

Alors tu as bien réussi ta vie 
Tu as déjà trouvé l'étoile do berger 
Et tu n'es plus seul sur la route 
Si see'est un ami, donnes ton pain et ton vin et ta vie 

Et refais le monde comme l'ont fait trois cents fois 
Don Quichotte et son vieux Sancho Panza 
Si see'est ton ami, dis-lui qu'il chante et puis chante avec lui 
La, la, la, la, la, la 

L'amitié see'est le plus beau pays 
Si see'est un ami, s'il devient fou quand tu fais des folies 
S'il te montre parfois qu'il avait peur pour toi 
Si rien de moins que le meilleur ne le satisfait pour toi 

Je dis que si, see'est un ami alors tu as réussi ta vie 
Chacun de son côté, on est que deux moitiés 
A deux on franchit des montagnes 
Si see'est un ami, donnes ton pain et ton vin et ta vie 

Et refais le monde comme l'ont fait trois cents fois 
Don Quichotte et son vieux Sancho Panza 
Si see'est ton ami, dis-lui qu'il chante et puis chante avec lui 
La, la, la, la, la, la 

L'amitié see'est le plus beau pays 
Si see'est un ami, s'il a ton rire s'il a tes larmes aussi 
Si les mêmes colères le prennent quand la terre 
Avec ses trompettes et ses guerres s'en va de travers 

Je dis que si, see'est un ami, tu peux dire un grand merci à la vie 
Puisqu'elle a fait de lui, un frère que tu choisis 
Et le compagnon de la chance 
Si see'est un ami, donnes ton pain et ton vin et ta vie 

Et refais le monde comme l'ont fait trois cents fois 
Don Quichotte et son vieux Sancho Panza 
Si see'est ton ami, dis-lui qu'il chante et puis chante avec lui 
La, la, la, la, la, la 

L'amitié see'est le plus beau pays 
Si see'est un ami, donnes ton pain et ton vin et ta vie 
Et refais le monde comme l'ont fait trois cents fois 
Don Quichotte et son vieux Sancho Panza 

Si see'est ton ami, dis-lui qu'il chante et puis chante avec lui",Hymne a l'Amitie
Celine Dion,"Douceur d'un ciel d'Amérique
Rêveur comme une musique
J'oublies déjà que tu es tout en pleurs
C'est déjà novembre sans toi

Je ne veux pas que tu te moques de moi
Non je ne le veux pas
Je ne veux pas que tu sois bien
Quand je suis loin de tes bras

Promesses dans le vent
Poésies sans rimes
Fumée sans flammes
C'est déjà novembre",Je Ne Veux Pas (1 Don't Want)
Celine Dion,"Matin solitaire
Soleil à l'envers
Mes jours s'endorment
Quand tu t'en vas
Murs de ma maison
Pour seul horizon
Un vide énorme
Tombe sur moi
Le temps qui balance
Entre deux silences
Le téléphone
Ne répond pas

Comme un cœur froid
La vie manque à la vie
L'amour manque à l'amour
Puisque tu n'es pas là

Balade inutile
À travers la ville
Des rues qui bougent
Et font du bruit
Le cœur fatigué
De vivre à moitié
Et les yeux rouges
Quand vient la nuit

On ne devrait pas ouvrir les portes
On ne devrait pas se séparer
Même un jour, une heure ou une nuit
Les avions et les trains qui t'emportent
Nous obligent à tout recommencer
Comme si chaque fois c'était fini
Comme si chaque fois c'était fini
Comme si chaque fois c'était fini

Comme un cœur froid
La vie manque à la vie
L'amour manque à l'amour
Puisque tu n'es pas là

Toi, le voyageur
Toi, toujours ailleurs
Ton paysage
Te suit partout
Moi, quand je veux faire
Le tour de la terre
Je ne voyage
Qu'autour de nous

J'ai le cœur froid
Tu n'es pas là
J'ai le cœur froid
Tu n'es pas là
J'ai le cœur froid
Tu n'es pas là",Comme un Coeur Froid
Celine Dion,"Il pense a moi, je le vois je le sens je le sais 
Et son sourire me ment pas quand il vient me chercher 
Il aime bien me parler des choses qu'il a vues 
Du chemin qu'il a fait et de tous ses projets 

Je crois pourtant qu'il est seul et qu'il voit d'autres filles 
Je ne sais pas ce qu'elles veulent ni les phrases qu'il dit 
Je ne sais pas ou je suis quelque part dans sa vie 
Si je compte aujourd'hui plus qu'une autre pour lui 

Il est si près de moi pourtant je ne sais pas comment l'aimer 
Lui seul peut décider qu'on se parle d'amour ou d’amitié 
Moi je l'aime et je peux lui offrir ma vie 
Même s'il ne veut pas de ma vie 

Je rêve de ses bras oui mais je ne sais pas comment l'aimer 
Il a l'air d'hésiter entre une histoire d'amour ou d’amitié 
Et je suis comme une ile en plein océan 
On dirait que mon cœur est trop grand 

Rien a lui dire il sait bien que j'ai tout a donner 
Rien qu'a sourire a l'attendre a vouloir le gagner 
Mais qu'elles sont tristes les nuits le temps me parait long 
Et je n'ai pas appris a me passer de lui 

Il est si près de moi pourtant je ne sais pas comment l'aimer 
Lui seul peut décider qu'on se parle d'amour ou d'amitié 
Moi je l'aime et je peux lui offrir ma vie 
Même s'il ne veut pas de ma vie 

Je rêve de ses bras oui mais je ne sais pas comment l'aimer 
Il a l'air d'hésiter entre une histoire d'amour ou d'amitié 
Et je suis comme une ile en plein océan 
On dirait que mon cœur est trop grand",D'Amour ou d'Amitie
Celine Dion,"Incognito 
Bien dans ma peau! 

Incognito
Bien dans ma peau!
Incognito
Je recommence ma vie à zero 

Incognito
Sans dire un mot

C'est pas facile de te tourner le dos 

M'en aller loin d'ici 
M'en aller loin de toi, loin de moi 
Loin d'ici une autre vie 
Loin de toi, il existe une autre moi 

M'en aller dans un pays
Où personne ne saura qui je suis
Solitaire je chercherai
Sur la terre un coin où je t'oublierai 

Loin de nous
Loin de tout
Loin du monde où j'etais ta possession 
Loin de nous

Loin de mes amis, de tes amis
Qui diront ce qu'ils voudront 
Dans mon dos
Je n'en saurai pas un mot 

Je m'en vais au bout du monde 
S'il le faut je m'ferai teindre en blonde 
Si jamais tu me revois 
J'te promets qu' tu n'me reconnaîtras pas 

Loin de nous
Loin de tout
Loin du monde où j'étais ta possession

Fièvre, fièvre 

Lève, lève 
Fièvre, fièvre

Lève, lève 
Fièvre, fièvre

Lève, lève 
Fièvre, fièvre 

Tout à coup j'ai su que je t'aimais
C'était comme un éclair
Comme un coup de tonnerre en moi
Tout à coup le monde est renversé
Brisé comme du verre
Et la terre s'envole en éclats
Devant moi, devant moi
Et je brûle et tu brûleras
Avec moi, avec moi 

Jours de fièvre
Jours de feu
Sur nos lèvres jusque dans nos yeux
Il se lève
Comme un torrent
Dans nos rêves, rêves délirants
Jours de fièvre
Dévorant
C'est la sève, le temps du tourment
Je soulève des volcans
Et j'ai la fièvre, fièvre, fièvre dans le sang 

C'est le monde à plus de 100 degrés
J'ai le ciel et l'enfer
J'ai l'amour et la guerre en moi
J'ai oublié tout ce que j'étais
Je marche et je me perds
Je ne vois plus à quatre pas 
Devant moi, devant moi
Et je brûle et tu brûleras
Avec moi, avec moi 

Jours de fièvre
Jours de feu
Sur nos lèvres jusque dans nos yeux
Il se lève
Comme un torrent
Dans nos rêves, rêves delirants
Jours de fièvre
Dévorant
C'est la sève, le temps du tourment
Je soulève des volcans
Et j'ai la fièvre, fièvre, fièvre dans le sang 

Cette fille qui se jette
À corps perdu
C'est moi qui ai perdu la tête
Ou quelqu'un d'autre, je ne sais plus 

Jours de fièvre
Jours de feu
Sur nos lèvres jusque dans nos yeux
Il se lève
Comme un torrent
Dans nos rêves, rêves délirants

Celine Dion,"Tu dis que je suis trop jeune
Pour vivre avec un homme

Moi je te dis
Je m'en fous, je m'en fous
I love you

Si tu ne veux pas prendre
L'amour que je te donne
Je pourrais te rendre fou, rendre fou
Jusqu'au bout

Lolita n'est pas trop jeune pour aimer
N'est pas trop jeune pour se donner
Quand le désir dévore son corps
Jusqu'au bout de ses doigts
Jamais trop jeune pour aimer
Jamais trop jeune pour se donner
Mais tu ignores le feu qui dort
Au fond de moi

Toutes ces nuits que j'ai passées
Seule à te caresser
Il faut que tu me les rendes, me les rendes
Une à une

Toutes ces nuits toute seule dans le noir de ma chambre
À rêver que tu viens me prendre
Me feras-tu encore attendre des jours, des mois?
Si tu ne viens pas, ce sera un autre
Si ce n'est pas toi, ce sera ta faute
Si je regrette toute ma vie
Ma première nuit d'amour

Trop jeune pour aimer
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire?
Lolita répond je m'en fous, je m'en fous
I love you

Je m'en fous
I love you
Je m'en fous
I love you",Lolita (Trop Jeune Pour Aimer)
