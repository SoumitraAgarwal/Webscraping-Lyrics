Hot Lips Page,"Ain't she sweet? See her walking down that street.
Yes I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?
Ain't she nice? Look her over once or twice.
Yes I ask you very confidentially, ain't she nice?
Just cast an eye in her direction, oh me oh my, ain't that perfection?
Oh I repeat, well, don't you think that's kinda neat?
Yes I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?

Ain't she sweet? See her walking down that street.
Yes I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?
Ain't she nice? Look her over once or twice.
Yes I ask you very confidentially, ain't she nice?
Just cast an eye in her direction, oh me oh my, ain't that perfection?
Oh I repeat, well, don't you think that's kinda neat?
Yes I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?

Oh I repeat, well, don't you think that's kinda neat?
Yes I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?

Hot Lips Page,"""I'm the Sheik of Araby, 
Your love belongs to me.
At night when you're asleep 
Into your tent I'll creep.
The stars that shine above,
Will light our way to love.
You'll rule this land with me;",The Sheik of Araby
Hot Lips Page,"Small fry, sittin' by the pool room
Small fry, should be in the school room
My, my, put down that cigarette
You ain't a-grown up high and mighty yet

Small fry, dancin' for a penny
Small fry, countin' up how many
My, my, just listen here to me
You ain't the biggest catfish in the sea

You practice peckin' all day long to some old radio song
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes
You better listen to your Maw and someday practice the law
And then you'll be a real success

Small fry, you kissed the neighbor's daughter
Small fry, should stay in shallow water
Seems I should take you 'cross my knee
You ain't the biggest catfish in the sea

You've got your feet all soakin' wet
You'll be the death of me yet
Oh my, oh my, small fry

",Small Fry
Hot Lips Page,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary
Hot Lips Page,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues
Hot Lips Page,"Up in the mornin' out on the job, work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun has nothin' to do 
But roll around heaven all day
Fuss with my woman toil for my kids
Sweat 'til I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do 
But roll around heaven all day

Good Lawd above, can't you know I'm pinin'
Tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver linin'
Lift me to paradise
Show me that river

Take me across and wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothin' to do 
But roll around heaven all day
 
Up in the mornin' out on the job, 
Work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun has nothin' to do 
But roll around heaven all day
Fuss with my woman toil for my kids

While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do 
But roll around heaven all day

Tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver linin'
Lift me to paradise

Take me across and wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothin' to do 
But roll around heaven all day",That Lucky Old Sun (Just Rolls Around Heaven All Day)
Hot Lips Page,"Carolina 
Gave me Dinah; 
I'm the proudest one 
Beneath the Dixie sun. 

News is spreadin' 
'Bout our weddin'; 
I hear church bells ringin', 
Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee! 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her,

To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night,

Hot Lips Page,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!
I'm in the mood for love",I'm in the Mood for Love
Hot Lips Page,"I let a song go out of my heart
It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Since you and I have drifted apart
Life doesn't mean a thing to me
Please come back, sweet music, I know I was wrong

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends

I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day

I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day",I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart
Hot Lips Page,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Hot Lips Page,"Talk to me baby
Tell me what's the matter now
Tell me, baby what's the matter now?
Are you tryin' to quit me, baby
But you don't know how

I've been your slave
Ever since I've been your babe
I've been your slave
Ever since I've been your babe

But before I see you go
I see you in your grave

I'm a good gal
But my love is all wrong

I'm a good gal
But my love is all wrong

I'm a real good gal
But my love is gone",Long Gone Blues
Hot Lips Page,"You took my kisses and you took my love
You taught me how to care
Am I to be just the remnant of a one-sided love affair?
All you took, I gladly gave
There's nothing left for me to save

All of me why not take all of me
Can't you see I'm no good without you
Take my lips I want to lose them
Take my arms I'll never use them
Your good bye left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on dear without you

You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me",All of Me
Hot Lips Page,"I love my man
I'm a liar if I say I don't
I love my man
I'm a liar if I say I don't
But I'll quit my man
I'm a liar if I say I won't

I've been your slave, baby
Ever since I've been your babe
I've been your slave
Ever since I've been your babe
But before I'll be your dog
I'll see you in your grave

My man wouldn't give me no breakfast
Wouldn't give me no dinner
Squawked about my supper then he put me outdoors
Had the nerve to lay a matchbox on my clothes
I didn't have so many
But I had a long, long ways to go

I ain't good looking
And my hair ain't curled
I ain't good looking
And my hair ain't curled
But my mother, she gave me something
It's going to carry me through this world

Some men like me 'cause I'm happy
Some 'cause I'm snappy
Some call me honey
Others think I've got money

Some say me Billie
Baby, you're built for speed
Now, if you put that all together
Makes me everything a good man needs",Billie's Blues
Hot Lips Page,"I look at them shuffle and the shuffle come down
Ramblin' and scramblin' and a-headin' for town
Hoppin' and boppin' and a-buzzin' around
Happily awaitin' at the station
I look at that train number 709
Hoppin' and boppin' and arrivin' on time
Who do you think is about to arrive
The band they call the Dixieland Five


They're gonna play that muskrat ramble tune
Like the way you never heard it played
Get ready for the big parade
All together now, one and two
Join that happy crowd
Tellin' me that ramblin' scramblin' muskrat song
Come on, ramble along
Yeah",Muskrat Ramble
Hot Lips Page,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street

Hot Lips Page,"I've always heard that haste makes waste
So I believe in takin' my time
The highest mountain can't be raced
It's something you must slowly climb
I want a slow and easy man
He needn't ever take the lead
'Cause I work on that long-time plan
And I ain't a-lookin' for no speed

I'm a one hour mama
So no one minute papa
Ain't the kind of man for me
Set your alarm clock papa
One hour, that's proper
Then love me like I like to be

I don't want no lame excuses
'Bout my lovin' bein' so good
That you couldn't wait no longer
Now I hope I'm understood

I'm a one hour mama
So no one minute papa
Ain't the kind of man for me

I can't stand no greenhorn lover
Like a rookie goin' to war
With a load of big artillery
But don't know what it's for

He's got to bring me a reference
With a great long pedigree
And must prove he's got endurance
Or he don't mean that to me

I don't like no crowin' rooster
What just kicks a lick or two
Action is the only booster
Of just what my man can do

I don't want no imitation
My requirements ain't no joke
'Cause I've got pure indignation
For a guy what's lost his stroke

I'm a one hour mama
So no one minute papa
Ain't the kind of man for me
Set your alarm clock papa
One hour, that's proper
Then love me like I like to be

I may want love for one hour
Then decide to make it two
Takes an hour before I get started
Maybe three 'fore I'm through

So no one minute papa

Hot Lunch Band,"Sitting at a fancy table, in a ritzy restaurant,
He was staring at his coffee cup,
Trying to get his courage up.
The talk was small when they talked at all,
They both knew what they wanted,
There was no need to talk about it,
They were old enough to talk it out, and still keep it loose.

They drove to the Family Inn, she didn't even have to pretend.
She waited in the car and he went to the desk,
Made his request while she waited outside.
When he came back with the key she said,
""Give it to me and I'll unlock the door.""

She said, ""I've never done this kind of thing before, have you?""

Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about

Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead

If I'm not back again this time tomorrow

Goodbye everybody I've got to go

I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

So you think you can love me and leave me to die

They are green just as far as I can see
As my memories return, oh how my heart did yearn
For you and the days that used to be 
High on a mountain top, standing all alone
Wondering where the years of my life have flown
High on a mountaintop, wind blowing free
Thinking about the days that used to be

Well, I wonder if you ever think of me
Or has time erased your memory
As I listen to the breeze whisper gently through the trees

Hot Rize,"As a young man I went riding out on the western plain
In the state of North Dakota I met my Nellie Kane 
I met my Nellie Kane

She was living in a lonely cabin with a son by another man
Five years she had waited for him as long as a woman can
As long as a woman can

   I don't know what changed my mind
   'Til then I was the rambling kind
   The kind of love I can't explain
   That I had for Nellie Kane

She hired me on to work that day to help her till the land
In the afternoon we planted seeds in the evening we held hands
In the evening we held hands

Her blue eyes told me everything a man could want to know
It was then I realized that I would never go   
That I would never go

Now many years have gone by and her son has grown up tall
I became a father to him and she became my all
She became my all

And the angels beckon to me
Before I go dear sisters and brothers
Won't you come and sing for me

   Sing those hymns we sang together
   In that plain little church with the benches all worn
   How dear to my heart how precious the moments
   We stood shaking hands and singing a song

My burden is heavy my way has grown weary
I have traveled a road that is long
And it would warm this old heart my dear brother

Until we meet where there's no more sad parting

All I heard the three words that you spoke

Would die when I awoke 

In those days our lives were simple 
I was yours and you were mine 
I was wrong to try and hold you tight 
Tie you to my side

Though the hard times beat down on me still

That I have made in my life
Time after time I never seem to learn
I would have money to burn, I would have money to burn

Lies and broken promises flow gently from the tongue
And I wish I had a nickel for every one
Sign yours most sincerely and send to whom it may concern
I would have money to burn, I would have money to burn

That I had spent like water day by day
Like some men made of mud there's a far road that I turn
