The Flaming Lips,"I was trained to ignore your pain
Open your heart to me
I trade the sun of its light
Open your heart, you'll see

Open your heart to me
Open your heart, you'll see
Open your heart to me
Open your heart (Are you a soldier?)

All the stars above all day
As bright as it can be
All the smart in my head
Open your heart and see

Open your heart to me
Open your heart, you'll see
Open your heart to me
Open your heart
Open your heart, you'll see",Peace Sword (Open Your Heart)

Fear of violence and of death

There is love and there is fame

There is evil that wants out
Always there, in our hearts,
There are sorrows and sadness
Always there, in our hearts,
Never moving, standing
Always there, in our hearts,
Something good that we can't control
Can't control, can't control, can't control

The Flaming Lips,"Did good, baby
So we can go
The time right now
Thing is

The sun shines now
But we’re so alone
It’s not, tis not
The light
That shines

The way, away
My heart can beat
Be free and go
Our days
Are empty

Is the love the god
That we control?
To try to trust
The pain

The sun shines now
But we can’t see
Its light lights now
We live
The same

Be free, away
But how can we
Find ours to hold?
A place

A place away
Away
Away
Away

Hiding in the clouds
You want it to love you

You can hear the voice
Telling you to love
It’s the voice of in came ultra

We are all standing alone
The terror’s in our heads
They don't control the controls

I turn to face the sun
We are still standing alone
At last we'll stand by the terror
It helps us take the controls

We’ll save the last sunshine
The way I long to go
We’ll save the love, you’ll still love
We’re searching through the dark

The Flaming Lips,"It's getting better all the time 
I used to get mad at my school 
The teacher's that taught me weren't cool 
You're holding me down 
Filling me up with your rules 

I've got to admit it's getting better 
A little better all the time 
I have to admit it's getting better 
It's getting better since you've been mine 

Me used to be angry young man 
Me hiding me head in the sand 
You gave me the word 
I finally heard 
I'm doing the best that I can 
I've got to admit it's getting better 

I used to be cruel to my woman 
I beat her and kept apart from the things that she loved 
Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene

Nothing to say but what a day how's your boy been
Nothing to do it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's okay
Good morning, good morning

Going to work don't want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep.
And you're on your own you're in the street
Good morning, good morning

After a while you start to smile now you feel cool.
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school.
Nothing has changed it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's okay
Good morning, good morning

People running round it's five o'clock.
Everywhere in town is getting dark.
Everyone you see is full of life.
It's time for tea and meet the wife.
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here.
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear.
Go to a show you hope she goes.
I've got nothing to say but it's okay
Good morning, good morning",Good Morning Good Morning
The Flaming Lips,"Lovely Rita meter maid,
Nothing can come between us, 
When it gets dark I tow your heart away. 

Standing by a parking meter, 
When I caught a glimpse of Rita, 
Filling in a ticket in her little white book. 
In a cap she looked much older, 
And the bag across her shoulder 
Made her look a little like a military man.
 
Lovely Rita meter maid, 
May I inquire discreetly, 
When are you free to take some tea with me. 
Took her out and tried to win her, 
Had a laugh and over dinner, 
Told her I would really like to see her again

Got the bill and Rita paid it, 
Took her home I nearly made it, 
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two. 

Oh, lovely Rita meter maid, 
Where would I be without you, 
Give us a wink and make me think of you",Lovely Rita

As the day begins 
Silently closing her bedroom door 
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more

Quietly turning the backdoor key 
Stepping outside, she is free

Is leaving (sacrificed most of our lives) 
Home (we gave her everything money could buy) 
She's leaving home, after living alone, for so many years (bye bye) 

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown 
Picks up the letter that's lying there 
Standing alone at the top of the stairs 
She breaks down and cries to her husband 
""Daddy, our baby's gone. 
""Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly? 
How could she do this to me?""

There will be a show tonight on trampoline 
The Hendersons will all be there 
Late of Pablo Fanques Fair-what a scene 
Over men and horses hoops and garters 
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire! 
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishops Gate

The Flaming Lips,"I read the news today oh boy 
About a lucky man who made the grade 
And though the news was rather sad 
Well I just had to laugh 

I saw the photograph. 
He blew his mind out in a car 
He didn't notice that the lights had changed 
A crowd of people stood and stared 
They'd seen his face before 
Nobody was really sure 
If he was from the House of Lords. 

I saw a film today oh boy 
The English army had just won the war 
A crowd of people turned away 
But I just had to look 
Having read the book 
I'd love to turn you on. 

Woke up, fell out of bed, 
Dragged a comb across my head 
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup, 
And looking up I noticed I was late. 
Found my coat and grabbed my hat 
Made the bus in seconds flat 
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke, 
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream. 

I read the news today oh boy 
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire 
And though the holes were rather small 
They had to count them all 
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall. 
I'd love to turn you on",A Day in the Life

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly

Towering over your head

And she's (Gone)

Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies

Climb in the back with your head in the clouds

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

The Flashcats,"Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads.
And mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the luster of mid-day to objects below.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tinny reindeer.

With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!

""Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! On, Cupid! on, on Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!""

As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With the sleigh full of Toys, and St Nicholas too.

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St Nicholas came with a bound.

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.
A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.

His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,
""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!""",Night Before Christmas

The Flatlanders,"The windmills and the water tanks all stand on solid ground
The country mailman mutters as he motors into town
The sunlight came, the sunlight went, the stars came out to see
The way I laughed at the way I cried at the way you treated me

The ocean babe is watered down but these plains are high and dry
And though you've seen your share of dreams, you've never seen me cry

The windshield and the radio play sadly through the night
A crazy blazin' fallin' star just passed me on the right
The tail lights down the highway fade low and out of sight
And that farmer's dog can only bark but this cold north wind can bite

The ocean babe is watered down but these plains are high and dry
And though you've seen your share of dreams, you've never seen me cry

The windbreaks and the watersheds are growin' old this year
The moon breaks in a brand new song while I break in a tear

I love you for all you are

The Flatlanders,"Woody walked out of the cotton field
In his head he had words that his lips concealed
An old airstrip where the weeds are growin'
A burned out bomber with the cockpit glowin'
With the key from a room to the Skyview Motel
He scratched words in the wing as a falling star fell

The moon sees you, the moon sees me
The moon sees who I want to see
I'll see you soon

Down in the light of the melon moon
Down in the light of the melon moon

On the other side of town 'n another side of life
Stella holds her breath and stares at the knife
She looks to the sky at the flash of a star
And just sees a man and a plane and a war
From a drawer by the bed she opens a book
To a sketch on a napkin that's torn half in two

The moon sees you, the moon sees me
The moon sees who I want to see
I'll see you soon
Down in the light of the melon moon
Down in the light of the melon moon

She doesn't feel lucky, she doesn't feel lost
She just feels like leavin', what ever the cost
Past the Skyview Motel with a man on her mind
Half her life in the headlights the other half behind
She passed a military truck by a cemetery wall
I guess good luck is better than no luck at all

Down on Filberts Rise

I chanced to meet a city girl
With clear blue sparkling eyes

Storm clouds on the Mountain
And tears all down her breast

Three ring circus rockin' round the sun
The taste of fire and Julia's name
Right there on the tip of my tongue

And the sun was goin' down
All I's wishin' for was Julia

I kissed her on the mouth, I looked her in the eye
I's actin' half my age and feelin' way too proud
I drove into the desert, I drove up to the sky
I parked it and I left it just a hangin' on a cloud

What's it mean when angels keep flying by above

I was empty-headed but my heart was full of love

I was on the mountain
Lightnin' all around
All I's lookin' for was Julia

The more you need her help the more she let's you down
The more you like the way she walks the more she shakes her hips
The more you fall in love with life the more she runs around
The more you fear the kiss of death the more she licks her lips

There was thunder rumblin' down

Some things I just don't get,
I'm not hearing from you yet
Still waiting for the help that never came

I'll walk out on the highway and see what I can find
Maybe nothing more than just a ride
They say the storm is over but they don't know my mind
Is there even any reason left to hide?

One side of a story that passes for real
But break it all down, it all becomes clear
It's the fearless who love and the loveless who fear

You cast a stone, you weren't alone, to cry for freedom
But you cried for more

Your children rise and lift their eyes and cry for freedom
Old men swear and darken the air with clouds of lies
Some for you, some for me, some forever
To heal their hearts they cry for freedom, while freedom cries

And we were born, bound in chains, to cry for freedom
We cast a stone, we weren't alone, to cry for freedom

The ones you love and skies above, cry for freedom
Heavy loads and open roads, cry for freedom
Birth and death and every breath, cry for freedom

Mountains tall, coyotes call
The river wide, the rising tide
The dove that mourns, a crown of thorns, cry for freedom

On a freeway full of smoke and haze
Where the power lines and fault lines double cross
I left our yellow porch light on
No one will notice no one's home
And no one else will notice what was lost

I lost my home when the deal went bust
To the so-called security and trust

I sent my wife and kids ahead
I'm right behind you, so I said
I'll be there when I get there if that's good

A burned out beer truck full of dents
A dried up stock pond by an old canal
Between the towns the desert sands
Filling up with empty cans

The way the bankers drove them out
In the wind and the dust in the crash of Ã¢??29

Behind an abandoned Texaco

The Flatlanders,"Everybody's saying it's just about time
But it's partly about space
The rest is all about not dividing things up
And leaving every last little piece in its place
You can start out slow
You can speed things up
You can take things as they are
Your average person is afraid to talk about death
But not afraid of driving a car
Take the whole ball of wax
Stick it to the facts
Life might stop on a dime
Sooner or later it's now or never
Don't you think it's just about time?

[Chorus]
Don't you think it's just about time?
Don't you think it's just about time?
Sooner or later it's now or never
Don't you think it's just about time?

You worry and you hurry and it's just about time
But it's partly about space
Everything that goes up must come down
And nothing's in the way until it gets in your face
It goes without saying that I must say
Some things are better left unsaid
Here and there
Gone everywhere
You may be just a-dreaming when you're
Waking up dead
Dying for love
Living in fear
Neither is a reason or rhyme
Sooner or later it's now or never
Don't you think it's just about time?

Somewhere beyond the dark and the dawn
Unsaid, unsung and unseen
Somewhere behind the back of your mind
Not beside, not before
Not even in between
Sitting in silence being in love
Looking for a mountain to climb
Sooner or later it's now or never
Don't you think it's just about time?

Some are denying it's just about time
Some don't believe in space
If you try to undo what's done been did
You'll mistake the static for the thrill of the chase
If time is money, space is credit
They're talking about it all over town
Are you rolling in the black or sinking in the red?
Is gravity the only thing that's holding you down?
It's hard to stop when you're picking up speed
Brother can you spare me a dime?
Sooner or later it's now or never
Don't you think it's just about time?

The Flatlanders,"My mind can't rest, I await the day
I turn and toss the night away
I hear my heart crawl through my veins
There's no relief from loves own chains

[Chorus]
Just like the winds that rule the skies
No one can bend the bind that ties
The more they try the more in vain
Love must be free from love's own chains

Oh what a fool I've always been
Free on the outside and chained within
How can it be, can you explain?
How to be free from love's own chains

[Chorus]

The rooster crows, the wild bird sings
I wonder what the day will bring

Where I've been
I don't need the game to tell me what it takes to win

And there's bound to be some more I never knew
But there's no two ways about it
I'll never need another

There's no way I'll never need to have you by my side
No way to never need a love so true

I don't need no World Wide Web to show me how it's done
I don't need no finish line to tell me that I've won
I don't need no cloud to hide the sun

I can think of several ways I'll never see the light
I have friends who've pointed out a few
But there's no two ways about it
I'll never need another
For there's no way I'll never need you

This is the road for all it's worth
It's a ribbon, it's a river, it's a wave

It's asleep and it's awake
And it stretches from the cradle to the grave

Thank God for the road
And the hubcaps and the headlights
And the mudflaps and the taillights
And the dim lights and the bright lights

Thank God for the road
And the miles that come between us
The little rains that come to clean us
The guardian angels who have seen us

Thank God for the road
No matter what it takes to drive it
Life and death can seem so private
Still you think you will survive it
Thank God for the road

And it stretches from the cradle to the grave

Thank God for the road
The soft shoulders you can cry on
The hard nerves you rely on
The fast curves you can die on

Thank God for the road
And the stars that shine above it
No matter what you once thought of it
You always knew you'd come to love it

And those old telephone poles
A cup of coffee and a sweet roll
When you're trying to save your own soul

[Chorus: x2]
There's never been a season yet
That never had an end
There's never been a reason yet
For lovers to pretend
There's never been a baby born
Without the eagle flying
Like there's never been a love been torn
Without one heart a-dying

A life without a fall
Like there's never been a love to grow
Where each did not give all

I been here before, I can't complain
Must be something in the book of revelation
Keeps on messing with my destination

That big old city nearly did me in
I got my doubts if I'll go there again
Turning back could turn into a heartbreak
Tonight I just need some shelter from a heartache

[Chorus]
Wishing for a rainbow
Listen to the wind blow
Wondering how can love grow
Wishing for a rainbow

I wonder if she found her way to Denver
If she still needs the love I said I'd send her
Like roses untended may grow withered
Love letters in my heart go undelivered

[Chorus]

Shattered glass all scattered Ã¢??cross the floor
Some fellow left his suitcase by the door
I'd like to think I left it all behind me
And know for sure the past will never find me
There are some who sanctify revenge
Time and life will leave them on the fringe
And some until the end will carry grudges
Time and life and death will be their judges

[Chorus]",Wishing for a Rainbow
The Flatliners,"


Every time I turn on the TV click to the news and I see is bad things happening
People dying and people killing
And everybody amplifying destruction and chaos all around the world
Every time I see it it makes my stomach curl

We've gotta make up for all the mistakes that have been made
And the way the media portrays the day
In the life of someone else as some stupid celebrity
The media takes a good story and pumps it full of evil
And I'm getting fed up with the whole deal
And everyday people are upset with the world itself
And I'm stuck in the middle of a growing trend
Where friends aren't friends until the end
They'll stab each other in the back for little recognition
Before they know what to do they're down to zero and nobody wants to know them

[Chorus:]
Freight train headed for me
And I can't see a thing
Freight train headed for me
Freight train of destruction like a punch in the face

News at 6 o'clock eleven eleven thirty
All I see is people dying
CNN and all the terrorists
When will this cycle of shit begin to end?

Every time I look at the news paper
I see the headlines saying things and jumping out at me
More modern war stories, more things to worry about
The list is piling up and it seems that I can't do a thing about it
The media makes fun of it and we have to live it

Every time I turn on the TV click to the news and I see it's some bad things happening
People dying and people killing
And everybody amplifying destruction and chaos all around the world
Every time I see it it makes my stomach curl

The Floacist,"If you feel alone is best to expose any thoughts of doubt,
You gotta air it out!
Awake, agree to know the day with the choices that you make,
Decide what you will live, decide what you will take,
Decisions, to release what you don't need
If you gotta let it be, then you have to let it be!
Be careful not to keep,
The residue of anything that had you feel weak,
Like what was said, versus what you think,
Sometimes you own assumptions of the ways that make you sink,
Feeling down,
It could be an addiction,
Getting up,
Right before the hesitation,
It takes determination,
Don't fall for the distractions,
These attractions are the target of your soul.
Asking you to stay when you know you have to go.
You know the things you know,
It's your past just your own,
Lessons will be lessened if you listen to their fear,
Hear your truth, keep it near!
And then you just breathe!

You gotta let it go,
Let it go so you can grow!
You gotta let it go,
Let it go! Breathe!

Avoid all this confusion,
Refuse this illusion even if you destiny is not blessed.
It's your time!
No matter who came before you,
Don't let them where you're down,
The pain of your heart,
She's your own mind.
It's irrelevant,
If relevance is measured by the elements
Without bearing a, without your own kind of,
You may find that we're living in an area that can't be defined.
Like those who thought that this was the end?
Like those who thought that the enemies would win,
Like those who let paranoia tend an insight out,
You know what this life is all about.
Can you remember before anyone had taught you
To feel as if life would never gonna treat you,
Better than a lesson, but that was in a pre-course,
What about now?
You took

Breathe!
You gotta let it go,
Let it go so you can grow!
You gotta let it go,
Let it go! Breathe!
You gotta let it go,
Let it go so you can grow!
You gotta let it go,
Let it go! Breathe!

You can do anything you want to do!
Anything that your heart truly chooses,
And may be a lonely journey but it's yours!
Is your purpose!
You may have to leave some things behind you,
You may have to change your mind
And you can't bring everybody with you,
They will be better off for having known you,
So just breathe!

You gotta let it go,
Let it go so you can grow!
You gotta let it go,
Let it go! Breathe!

Let it go so you can grow!

Why would they believe in us?

I had you 
When my life was rearranged 
I had you 
When I hit rock bottom babe 
I had you

I had you 
When I thought nobody cared 
I had you

The Floacist,"She started with a day dream
Working on a maybe
Focusing on being there
Standing in the middle

Start composing for the camera and her mind
Keep an ordered diet behind it
She's on the golden path
Everywhere that she goes

And it's only her who knows her purpose and real truth
She's not afraid that she'll lose
Cause there is no such thing
When you do something special

More or less it just feels equal
Listen to the beats and headphones
She writes everywhere she goes
On napkins and paper bags

Few verse or a rhyme
Sometimes she stays up all night
Cause her frequencies are clear
She intends to be the difference she wants to hear

She makes it clear she's not the property of commodity
Of some brother with a big chain
She's got real games not tricks
Slick and quick

Watching no one but herself
Inspired by everything
Handle no dream
She's more than a desire in everything they need

She's a queen
Walking in the light on the hill toward her horizon
Sharing she knows who she is and that's a good thing
She's prepared for the opportunity of success

She's truly blessed
And you can hear it

[Chorus]
It's the way that you rock
When you're doing your thing
It's the way that you flow
Make the people wanna sing
Go get it go get it
If it's yours
Go get it go get it
The way that you flow
Makes the people wanna sing

She tries to keep her mind fit
She works ? rhyme
She has attraction on everything
She's a magnet

Power and energy makes the enemy obey
Makes the people rock and
Music chooses her
She keeps performing

And instead of using her art platform to be a diva
The people start to see her
She gets naked in her craft
Wearing a heart and her panties

Means that she feels a piece on the stage
Like she always has things to say
The desire to heal and grow
Not claiming to know all the things

But every day she remembers
Chanel in
Like she's plugged into a source
Of course she has learned from examples

It's like her spirit is a sample of it
She writes and he wrote
So she goes where her mind shows her
Sharing what she finds

Maybe she's been doing for life time
She's in her mind and you can hear her soul
Every time you hear her flow
Listen close

[Chorus]

What you wanna do?
You can hear it calling
If the time is now
Tell me what you are waiting for
You are everything you need
You have everything and more

Overflowing amongst the golden nick time of possibilities.

Bleed of grass to ancient trees,
Shiny flower into the sweetest fruits of love.

Before the message of our true blessings,
Before the confusion.

Now been to remember anything that thinks of truth,
It started a long time ago, so many without numbers,
No longer recognizing each other is keen
And love becomes a concept, not a necessity
Not a believer to be family.

The spiritual language replaced by commercial tongues.
The lacking of word for heal, awakening,
Feels enlightening.

The Flying Burrito Brothers,"I was walking down the street the other day
A sight came before my eyes
It was a little hippie boy
I must have been twice his size

His appearance typefied his strange breed
Gaudy clothes, long stringy hair hanging down
I'd seen perhaps a thousand
In my early trips to town

As he walked on beside me on down the block
I noticed no unpleasing smell
He might have been on the weed or even LSD
But if he was I couldn't tell

So we walked together that way through this neighborhood
Finally he turned around to me and he
He said ""friend you know we're a million miles apart
But you know something?
We can enjoy the sunshine and the weather
So why don't we put our differences aside
And just talk to each other?
You see this box beneath my arm?
To you it's plain, it has no charm
But to someone dearest to my heart
This box has played a tragic part

This little one can't tell you himself
About his life and how he died
But if anyone else could speak for him,
I guess I'm qualified
This boy was in Chicago, he didn't know why he was there
He was with his family and friends and he didn't really care
You might have been one of those who saw
The struggle there on your television screen
The tragic thing is so much else happened

That no one else could have seen
A stranger handed this boy a dollar
To do a simple chore
To carry a package to a nearby hotel

And when he returned he'd get two more
But when he came back he sort of lost his way walking through the crowd
One of them things you ask yourself,
How the Lord allowed

But when he was found he was like he is now,
Dreaming sweet and still
And in his little hand was a crumpled dollar bill
Now you can take that dollar
Get four cents on it, compound it quarterly at any downtown bank

So they can back some hot new tank or atom bomb
Well, what I'm going to tell you now, you can stay or you can leave
You kind of listened to my story so far but just one more thing
It's the same for any hippie, bum or hillbilly out on the street

Just remember this little boy and never carry more than you can eat
Now could you help us sing this song, please

There will be peace in the valley for him now we pray
I will think of the little hippie boy that way",Hippie Boy

That stuck on my mind
When she walked out on me
For the very last time
Oh mamma sweet mamma
Can you tell me what to say

That's where I found myself
With a bottle of wine
And some pills off the shelf

And I'm feeling so ashamed

Down the hallway to his doom

Just before he reached my cell

With a song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
And take me away and turn back the years
Sing me back home before I die

Just to sing a few old gospel song
And I heard him tell the singers

Could you sing it once before we move along?""",Sing Me Back Home

The Flying Burrito Brothers,"Well, I sold the farm to take my woman
Where she longed to be
We left our kin and all our friends
Back there in Tennessee

I bought those one way tickets
She had often begged me for
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore

Well, her heart was filled with gladness
When she saw those city lights
She said the prettiest place on earth
Is Baltimore at night

Well, a man feels proud
To give his woman what she's longing for
And I kind of liked the streets of Baltimore

Then I got myself a factory job
I ran an old machine
And I bought a little cottage
In a neighborhood serene

And every night when I'd come home
With every muscle sore
She'd drag me through the streets of Baltimore

Well, I did my best to bring her back
To what she used to be
Then I soon learned she loved those bright lights
More than she loved me

Now I'm a-going back on that same train
That brought me here before

She's a solid seventeen
Young enough to dance and sing
Old enough to get that swing
Past sixteen just been kissed
Graduated and got that twist
The kind of love you can't resist
At seventeen

Now sloppy shirt, old blue jeans
Dirty shoes by all means
Patch of blonde, peroxide hair
Jukebox baby ain't no square
Seventeen, she's the queen
Cutest gal you've ever seen

Home where you belong ( belong, Oh! come . . . ) 
Oh! come home rollin' stone, 
You've been away too long! 

I wandered into Kansas a-singin' a song 
Singin' doodle-doo-day, all day! 
And then I got a feelin' that somethin' was wrong 
When a voice in my heart seemed to say . . . 

Come home rollin' stone, 
Home where you belong, belong, 
Oh! come home rollin' stone, 
You've been away too long! 

I left my love a-weepin' in old Arkansas 
Left her for the freight cars that passed 
But last night in a tavern, I swear that I saw 
Her face in a shimmering glass . . . 

( Come home rollin' stone, 
Home where you belong, belong, 
Oh! come home rollin' stone, 
You've been away too long . . . ) 

Now, when I hear that lonesome old train comin' near 
And the moon is over the track 
Oh somewhere from the shadows I know that I'll hear 
Her voice in the clickity clack! 

Oh come home rollin' stone, 
Home where you belong, belong,

The Fontane Sisters,"To know you, is to love you, 
And I love you 'cause I know you 
Are such a sweetheart 
That when you walk down the street, 
Everyone's heart, just naturally skips a beat! 

The others, who have met you, 
Better start in to forget you 
Because, to know you is to love you so, 
It's time for everyone you know, 
To know you love me! 

Were you the sun, it would be twice as sunny, 
Were you a bee, there would be sweeter honey, 
Were you a tune everyone would be croonin' 
Harmonizin' out in the street! 
You're such a bundle of me oh my, 
And that's the reason when you go by, 
Each heart naturally skips a beat! 

Dear 
The others 
(Were you the spring, you would be twice as springy!)
Who have met you 
(Were you a vine, you would be twice as clingy!)
Better start in 
(Were you the moon, everyone would be spoonin'!)
To forget you 
(Every night would be mighty sweet!)
Because, to know you is to love you so, 
It's time for everyone you know, 
To know you love me! 

Because, to know you is to love you so, 
It's time for everyone you know, 
To know you everyone should know you 
Know yes, know you love me!

",Late Night Conversations
The Forecast,"Spending nights trying to find out why kids are dying
Some are cutting themselves
While others rely on pills
Which leads to finding your father's gun
And saying this life's not worth living

We need to learn to defend depression
With our friends before they fade out
",Losing Signal
The Forecast,"Lay down, let's start a family
Lay my fears and my failures
To rest, no more dreams

(You can't sleep, you can't see your future)
You'll lie awake waiting for your moment
To shine, precious time
(You can't waste)

Just waiting weighed down by the fears
Of our fathers can't stop us now
Because waking up with the road
Moving under our feet is what moves us

Lay down, you're almost dead now
You're getting older, we're getting colder
You're moving out you'll trade your six string
For a family and a desk and I don't blame you for giving up
",Seating Subject to Availability
The Forecast,"Sleeping in I'll begin again to shed this skin
And be born again
We'll drink to forget and drink to forgive
We'll rethink our futures, rethink our futures

I can't remember what he said
When he left my bed and left my life last night
But I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about

So stay if you can, won't you stay if you can?
And lead me to your promised land
So stay if you can, won't you stay if you can?
And lead me to your promised land

Fall in, fit in, let the broken hearts club dance
Fall in, fit in, let the broken hearts club dance
Fall in, fit in, let the broken hearts club dance

So stay if you can, won't you stay if you can?
And lead me to your promised land
So stay if you can, won't you stay if you can?
And lead me to your promised land

The Forecast,"Have you ever seen stars like these
With a night like this wishin' it could last for weeks
And I'm convinced that soon you'll see
These summer leaves turn to a winter breeze

Like why these lights burn out so quick
I will show you the country and all its secrets
Like why these lights burn out so quick

Have you ever seen roads like these
With a sky so bright from the western light
And I've foreseen a new family
Forged from blood and bone just off the coast
Put a record on they say it soothes the soul
And takes us back in time when we walked in fields of gold
With the radio playing these random hits
We'll move onto a western view

We'll drop our heads real slow to the ground

And always seem to help us trip and fall

The game has started and now we must catch up
Unfaithful friends lets burn them down

This trust is broken
We have less to depend on
A sincere feeling of being defeated
We're growing tired of waiting and wishing
And throwing our coins down to the fountain

come home quickly but please drive safely
Come home in one piece
Just say that you miss me
And please come quickly
I just need you in my arms

we have put in long nights
Where we can't even stand up
We've made our beds by where our heads lie
We're cutting teeth on dreams of excess
With rolled up sleeves we're bound to push on

Smoke is rising faster and we'll fall behind 
Wait this out with me

Swept away by a traveler's life will you call me out?

You have nothing left to prove 
Then what are you running from my dear 
Secrets I've packed away that I can't even explain 
We can talk this out 
No we can't so
Stay away boy 
My heart is an empty room 
Can you tell me how we came to this

I want you to feel me baby
I want you to understand me baby
This is it yo, no bullshit
No jokes, no games
This is it yo, fo real
I see it happenin' man
It's about to go down
For all of us (fo real)
I see you swinging, I see you noddin' to it
It's about to go down for us, word up man
We almost home
We almost at the finish line nigga
It feel good, don't it? Oh!
And it's ova!
I can go home and chill
(Feel it, yo)

[Verse 1]
It's a long process from bar 1 to bar 16 and
Writin in my notebook from morn' to evenin
But my fam still not believin' - in my bed late
At night with my eyes closed often dreamin'
And zoned out I'm goin' out fuck it I'm home now
Arrestin' the rhythm I'm a rolling stone now
Making my own way from stone cold days and long nights
But who could feel my sacrifice
Cause they ain't half as nice and couldnt' understand
How I feel when I'm on the track board turnin the knob switch
Moms keep talking that old ""get a real job"" shit
And that's the kind of thinking Phonte got a prob with
Solved it - my blood fam on the bandwagon
Can't believe the man put his plan into action
They rather that I choose a different plan for my passion
Couldn't understand I demand satisfaction

[Hook]
They say you might be crazy
and sometimes I agree
You and I know that's not all that you are

They say you might be crazy
? baby
You and I know that's not all that you are

[Verse 2]
Yo, it's a new day it's time to see
I got a seed, Amaya, the love of my life
Best believe, plus I still got love for me
I'm doin this for her and me, take mics and make currency
Steady worryin' yo, I wish I had a clone of me
Man this ain't the way it supposed to be
My daughter's mom wishin she was close to me
Holdin' me, instead she's lonely - and loathing
Complaining that her life's competin' with mine
Cause I be out of the house for weeks at a time
And she be stuck at home playing housewifey with an attitude
Before we had a kid, we should've had a clue
I fell asleep with this beat on repeat
Repetitively, life seems to grip me
I'm trying to be a better man, please believe me
Ready and god willin if you ready to teach me

They say you might be crazy
and sometimes I agree
You and I know that's not all that you are

They say you might be crazy

You and I know that's not all that you are

[4 bar bridge]
(Real talk, yo)

[Verse 3]
Everybody gotta way to try to be the man
Some write rhymes others move kilograms
You ain't tryna play yourself with me neither man
Because I was dealt I can play 'em with either hand (c'mon)
I gotta be the plan, put it in motion
A nigga on the grind I'm proceedin with focus
I know that makin my moves ain't a part of your plans
But understand that that ain't all that I am
I was lost in the ?
Got a call from a man with a studio he bought with a grand
Feel like destiny was in the palm of his hand
Real shit we can all understand (check it out yo)

When I had something to prove and an axe to grind

Aiyyo man, I don't ask for much
I just wanna chill at home and sip my drink out of my plastic cups
Even though my roommate have me mad as fuck
Nigga be acting crackish, fucking up my money hustling backwards
Financially I took some hard blows
But shit I also rocked some hard shows
Niggas came to check us out by the carloads
Screaming my name like I scanned a million barcodes already
My squad flows till we all sweaty
We struggling to pay our bills so we really can't ball heavy
And God knows I be calling on him
Cause I be writing mad cheques that might as well have Spalding on 'em
The shoulders of my team, I be falling on 'em
Providing support that help the pain go away
And helping me to see the light like Towa Tei standing by me
That's all I really need to satisfy me
It's just my peeps y'all, for real

Good music in my life, it makes me happy
Uh uh, now bring it back
So happy

There's been nights I wanted to quit, broke, crying to God
It's kinda hard going far with a lot to carry
Waking up still tired from sessions
Going to class, dozing off, waking up, never learning the lessons
But thanks to my faith and blessing
Struggles pass and I go about life without half the stressing
I know who got my back, no need for raising the question
Cause when times get hard, it's to my brothers I call
Taking the weight, no matter large or small
I smile everyday, thanks to y'all, we gonna eat for real
Ease the mind so we can sleep for real
It took longer than we wished but the blow meant I knew we could
Find the best way to live life, it's so right
We jail tight, ain't no strip stopping our move
We one nation all under a groove
Sending peace to that cat Nicolay, we gonna meet real soon

The Foreign Exchange,"Spokesman of the precious few
I represent the views of independent youth
that wrestle nail and tooth to evade neckties and suits
Cause truthfully a nine-to-nine's a waste of time
Plus a waste of mind, so I blaze a dime
Tryna find creative ways to escape the grind
I gotta take what's mine in this land of milk and honey
filled with money, still hungry and won't finish
till I fill my tummy, grill me or love me
My passion is unbridled, when idol crafted recitals
They can't lose like Magic or Michael, pick or choose
Not only dropping knowledge but slamming and dishing jewels
Navigate with slicker moves, through the gritty city I cruise
Confused what to do with my life, but got my sights set on the apex
It's a safe bet that I ain't taking no for an answer
This quest for dough is like a cancer
Spreading over body parts, especially my mind and heart
Time to start the relentless pursuit so I can make my mark
on this planet, granted I meant it, see-saw mechanics
from circumstances that only causing confidence damage
Planet firmly I'm standing on the outskirts of the average
Relishing the challenger till the day my spirit vanish
Man this life is tough and I've had enough, my tank's on empty
Valleys are plenty, but from the top they can't prevent me
The rotten apple, it tempts me, locked in the grapple at Lensy
Time to take stock and watch how far determined they should get me

[Chorus]
Everybody across the world better get your hustle on
Out in the street, move your feet before your money's gone
Mama can't sleep and baby need clothes
I gotta make my moves so I got some
Mama can't sleep and baby need clothes
I gotta make my moves so I got some
Yeah, yeah

Stress should hear me, never any rest for the weary
Try to progress, at best I eat, sleep barely
The future is scary and so I proceed to look for solid ground
But difficult because I'm always in and out of town
Weigh by the pound, not in a duffle
I bear a bigger burden on my back that go beyond the strength of muscle
The hustle and bustle, trying to figure out the puzzle
of how to triumph amongst the troubles sent to bust your bubble
Trust I'm accustomed with the everyday
I wonder will my stress will ever decay, looking for a better way
Ahead of the days of a bigger mission, sealing my vision
C.A.L.I.B.E.R. living and bringing it to fruition
Lord if you listen, I'm only asking for the strength
to bask in the paper after laboring for such length
It's like an eternity with much ahead
I hope of every second I invested, I'm collecting at the end

[Chorus: x2]

Just do it, just do it
Just do it, do it, do it
Just do it, just do it
Just do it, do it, do it

We gotta hustle y'all, right now y'all

I done gave up my check before the first dollar could get spent
It's bullshit, ain't it? And they wonder why my eyes jaded
Dark brown with the reflection of HATE in it
Round face with the trace of pain still hoverin'
Ya boy won't let it cover him
Smotherin' all competition, like hash golden browns
From the house's beautiful kitchen, get served pronto

For me to, take my philosophies and quote it in rhymes
And then attempt just to open your mind - you know my style, playa
A throwback like Cherry Now & Laters
Or Sunday afternoons in the room listenin to Kaljada
My rhymes never dramatize, applied for the job of rap, nigga
But I was over-qualified
Apoligize to my girl and my kid
Told 'em, that I was sorry for the way that I lived
A nigga always bein gone so much, been away so long
I never realize they grown so much
Another studio, another microphone to crush
So I can rock your stereo and headphones and such
In freestyles we ain't known to duck, I'm known to buck
At any nigga snatchin that I bone to shuff

Than the nigga who just writes the checks
And standin' at the door, wanderin' from right to left
Tryin' to decide if it's right to step and just bail with it

For so long I feel like we tried to jail with it
And done invested to much to say the hell with it
Two thousand miles from home, tryin' to call you
To tell you 'bout the road and all the presents I bought you

But tensions in the room every time that I walk through
And every other day another argument sparks you
We don't smile no more and you ain't easy to talk to

Just tryin' to make sure that no harm surrounds you
I can't pay the price of what it costs to doubt you
It's all love, baby, I'd be lost without you

I would never ever hurt you
Can't you see my love is sincere
See, I just want to be the one

Waiting for the daylight
Cause then she?ll keep me

She never leaves me

And when the sun rises, she watches over me

He thinks nobody knows
We lay together in daylight
I love him so

And when the sun rises, he watches over me

It?s not like it was before

I will cling to the old rugged cross

So the stairs that you could climb are the ones you've left behind and your eyes light up when we talk about the past. God I miss those songs we used to sing. Talking like getting away would be the greatest thing. Well me, I got out, and you singing to me like that's really gunna set this free.

I want to keep you by my side

So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

[Chorus]

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so
The look of love

Let this be just the start of
So many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

[Chorus]",The Look of Love [Live]
The Foundations,"I still get the same old feeling
Tearing at this heart of mine
Telling me that maybe I'm
Not really over you

I still get the same old yearning
Turning my heart inside out
Love, there can't be any doubt
I'm still not over you

The oak tree where you carved my name
A year ago now
Somehow doesn't really look the same

I think it closed now
The places we would go
Still play the songs we used to know

I still get the same old feeling
Tearing at this heart of mine
Telling me that maybe I'm
Not really over you

I still get the same old yearning
Turning my heart inside out
Love, there can't be any doubt
I'm still not over you

The cottage where we used to meet
Is overgrown now
We dreamed we'd live there too someday

Just on our own now
The letters you wrote me
Still bring that sentimental ring

I still get the same old feeling
Tearing at this heart of mine
Telling me that maybe I'm
Not really over you

I still get the same old yearning
Turning my heart inside out
Love, there can't be any doubt
I'm still not over you

",That Same Old Feeling
The Foundations,"[Chorus: x2]
Baby, now that I've found you
I can't let you go
I'll build my world around you
I need you so
Baby, even though you don't need me
You don't need me.

Baby, baby, since first we met (doot-doot)
I knew in this heart of mine (I wanna tell you, doot-doot)
The love we had could not be bad (doot-doot)
Play it right and bide my time

Spent a lifetime looking for somebody
To give me love like you
Now you've told me that you wanna leave me
Darling, I just can't let you.

[Chorus: x2]

Spent a lifetime looking for somebody
To give me love like you
Now you've told me that you wanna leave me
Darling, I just can't let you.

[Chorus: x2]","Baby, Now That I Found You"
The Four Aces,"Day by day I'm falling more in love with you
And day by day my love seems to grow
There isn't any end to my devotion
It's deeper dear by far than any ocean

I find that day by day you're making all my dreams come true
So come what may I want you to know
I'm yours alone, and I'm in love to stay
As we go through the years day by day",Day by Day
The Four Aces,"Take away the breath of flowers
It would surely be a sin
Take the rain from April showers
It's a sin

Take away the violins, dear
From a lovely symphony
And the music deep within
Would cease to be

Is it a sin
To love you so?
To hold you close
And know you are leaving

Though you take away my heart, dear
Still the beating there within
I'll keep loving you forever
For it's no sin

Is it a sin
To love you so?
To hold you close
And know you are leaving

Though you take away my heart, dear
Still the beating there within
I'll keep loving you forever
For it's no sin

",(It's No) Sin
