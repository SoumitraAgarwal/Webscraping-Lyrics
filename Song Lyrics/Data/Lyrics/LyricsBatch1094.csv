Placebo,"Drag

You're always ahead of the game
I drag behind
You never get caught in the rain
When I'm drenched to the bone every time
You're the first one to swim across the Seine
I lag behind
You're always ahead of the game
While I drag behind

I drag behind
I drag behind
I drag behind
I drag behind

You're always ahead of the pack
I drag behind
You possess every trait that I lack
By coincidence or by design
You're the monkey I've got on my back
That tells me to shine
You're always ahead of the pack
While I drag behind.

I drag behind
I drag behind
I drag behind
I drag behind

You're always ahead of the rest
When I'm always on time
You got A's on your algebra tests
I failed and they kept me behind
I just got to get off my chest
That I think you're divine
You're always ahead of the rest
While I drag behind.

I drag behind
I drag behind
I drag behind
I drag behind",Drag
Placebo,"The call to arms was never true
Time to imbibe here's to you
I'll tell you stories bruised and blue
Of drum machines and land slides
Just one more round before we're through
More psychedelic yuppie flu
Its such a silly thing to do

And now we're stuck on rewind
Let's follow the cops back home
Follow the cops back home
Lets follow the cops back home
And rob their houses

The call to arms was never true
Lets take a ride and push it through
Suspended animation glue
Blame it on apartheid
Lets spend the night in jimmy choose 
I'll give you coats and cheap shampoo
I'll give you nothing else to do

And now we're stuck on rewind
Let's follow the cops back home
Follow the cops back home
Lets follow the cops back home

Lets take a dive swim right through

Placebo,"In cold light of morning while everyone is yawning
You're high
In the cold light of morning the party gets boring, you're high 
As your skin starts to scratch and wave yesterdays action goodbye

Forget past indiscretions
And stolen possessions
You're high
In the cold light

In the cold light of morning while everyone's yawning
You're high
In the cold light of morning 
You're drunk sick from whoring and high
Staring back from the mirrors
A face that you don't recognize

It's a loser a sinner a cock and a dildos disguise

I will be the one to make you crawl
So I came down to wish you an unhappy birthday
Someone call the ambulance, there's gonna be an accident

I'm coming up on infra-red,
There is no running that can hide you
'cause I can see in the dark
I'm coming up on infra-red,
Forget your running, I will find you

One more thing before we start the final face off
I will be the one to watch you fall
So I came down to crash and burn your beggar's banquet

I'm coming up on infra-red,
There is no running that can hide you

Can't you see these skies are breaking?
Cause the back of the class is where I'm from

I am one

I'm on a race and it's killing time
I don't need yours I'll keep it with mine

Thank you

Two of a kind and no one home
I'm in a crowd and I'm still alone
Can't you see these skies are breaking?

Be sure to come around

Wearing a frown

Saw you crashing around the bay
Never seen you act so shallow
Or look so brown.

How your promises rang hollow
As you threw me into the ground.

In the city or the suburbs

Though I don't like you anymore

A song to say,
Before our innocence was lost
You were always one of those blessed with lucky sevens,
And the voice that made me cry.

You were Mother Nature's son.
Someone to whom I could relate.
Your needle and your damage done,
Remains a sordid twist of fate,
Now I'm trying to wake you up,
To pull you from the liquid sky.
Cause if I don't we'll both end up with just your songs that say goodbye.

I'm always falling on my face.
This attitude that I embrace,
For a love I'm trying to replace.
Try to kill this song,

It's hard to reconcile,
What I've become.
With the wounded child,
Hiding deep inside.

I wanna see another dawn,
Comin' up for air!
Sick of the slaughter,
I'm comin' up for air!
'Cause I've floating here too long.

Take my ego for a ride,
'Cause there's nobody by my side.
It's getting hard to justify.
And it won't be long 'til I collide.
My weaknesses laid bare,
As people stop and stare.
But It's the last time, I swear.

It's hard to reconcile,

Hiding deep inside.

When I pretend' I was OK.
I had so very much to say,
About my crazy livin'.
Now that I've stared into the void,
So many people, I've annoyed.
I have to find a middle way,
A better way of livin'.

So I haven't given up,
That all my choices, my good luck
Appear to go and get me stuck,
In an open prison.
Now I am tryin' to break free,
In a state of empathy.
Find the true and enemy,
Eradicate this prison.

And no-one can tear it apart.

Our task is to transform ourselves into awakened multidimensional beings
Thus fully merging the fourth and fifth dimensions into the third
It is the inner union between Earth ascending and Heaven descending
This sacred merger has already been achieved by many of us
And numerous others are awakening daily as the Call steadfastly intensifies
We are reclaiming our Divine Birthright and Heritage
Remembering that we are Angels incarnate, vast starry beings of Light
Who are no longer limited and bound by the illusions of time, space and matter

We are ready to join as emanations of the One
The new doorways cannot be opened or passed through
By any of us still operating as individual beings of consciousness
They are brought into manifestation through our Unified Presence
Through our focused intent
Through our total commitment to serving our Higher Purpose
This is the bridge to an entirely different energy patterning
It is the step beyond the known dimensional universe
It is a journey into the unknown which shall lead us ever closer to home",Hold On to Me

Like a storm in the desert
Like a sleepy blue ocean
You fill up my senses
Come fill me again",Annie's Song
Plácido Domingo,"Time after time
I tell myself that im
So lucky to be loving you

So lucky to be
The one you run to see
In the evening, when the day is through

I only know what I know
The passing years will show
Youve kept my love so young, so new

And time after time
Youll hear me say that im
So lucky to be loving you ","Time after Time, song"

And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap

If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere

Que apesar de estaray aquí
Soy del pueblo why jamas lo podre olvidar
Debéis creérme, mis lujos
Son solamente un disfraz
Un juego burgués, nada mas
Las reglas del ceremonial

Tenia que aceptar debi cambiar
Why dejar de vivir en lo gris
Siempre tras la ventana
Sin lugar bajo el sol
Busqué ser libre
Pero jamas dejaré de soñar
Why solo podré conseguir
La fe que querrais compartir

No llores por mi Argentina
Mi alma está contigo
Mi vida entera te la dedico
No te alejes, te necesito

Jamas poderes ambicioné
Mentiras dijeron de mi
Mi lugar suyo es, por vosotros luché
Yo solo quiero
Sentiros muy cerca
Poder intentar
Abrir mi ventana why saber
Que nunca me vais a olvidar

No llores por mi Argentina

No llores por mi Argentina
Mi alma está contigo
Mi vida entera te la dedico
No te alejes, te necesito

Qué mas podré decir
Para convencerte de mi verdad
Si aun quereis dudar
Mirad mis ojos ver
Como lloran de amor

We used to go
Not even if there's someone

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away

la vergüenza de habersido
y el dolor de ya no ser...
Bajo el ala del sombrero,
cuántas veces embozada
una lágrima asomada
yo no pude contener...
Si crucé por los caminos
como un paria que el Destino
se empeño en deshacer...
Si fui flojo, si fui ciego,
sólo quiero que comprendan
el valor que representa
el coraje de querer.

Era para mí la vida entera,
como un sol de primavera,
mi esperanza y mí pasión.
Sabía
que en el mundo no cabía
toda la humilde alegría
de mi pobre corazón.
Ahora, 
cuesta abajo en mi rodada,
las ilusiones pasadas
yo no las puedo arrancar.
Sueño
con el pasado que añoro,
el tiempo viejo que lloro
y que nunca volverá.

Por seguir tras de su huella
yo bebí incansablemente
en mi copa de dolor,
pero nade comprendía
que si todo yo lo daba
en cada vuelta dejaba
pedazos de corazón.
Ahora, triste en la pendiente,
solitario y ya vencido,
yo me quiero confesar.

el amor que me ofrecía,
por aquellos ojos brujos
yo habría dado siempre más!

Plaid,"They came for him one winter's night.
Arrested, he was bound.
They said there'd been a robbery,
his pistol had been found.
They marched him to the station house,
he waited till the dawn.
And as they led him to the dock,
he knew that he'd been wronged.
""You stand accused of robbery,""
he heard the bailiff say.
He knew without an alibi,
tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom.
Over the hills and far away,
for ten long years he'll count the days.
Over the mountains and the seas,
a prisoner's life for him there'll be.
He knew that it would cost him dear,
but yet he dare not say.
Just where he'd been that fateful night,
a secret it must stay.
He had to fight back tears of rage.
His heart beat like a drum.
For with the wife of his best friend,
he spent his final night of freedom.
Over the hills and far away,
he swears he will return one day.
Far from the mountains and the seas,
back in her arms again he'll be.
Over the hills and far away.
Over the hills and,
over the hills and,
over the hills and far away.
Each night within his prison cell,
he looks out through the bars.
He reads the letters that she wrote.
One day he'll know the taste of freedom.
Over the hills and far away,
she prays he will return one day.
As sure as the rivers reach the seas,
back in his arms again she'll be.
Over the hills and far away,
he swears he will return one day.
As sure as the river reach the seas,
back in his arms is where she'll be.
Over the hills and far away,
she prays he will return one day.
As sure as the rivers reach the sea,
back in her arms is where he'll be.
Over the hills,
over the hills and far away.
Over the hills,
over the hills and far away.

That roll back when she's laughing at me
She rises up like the tide

When the moon is low
We can dance in slow motion
And all your tears will subside
All your tears will dry

And long after I've gone
You'll still be humming along
And I will keep you in my mind

I'm a thousand miles away
But, girl, tonight you look so pretty
Yes, you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear, it's true

Hey there, Delilah
Don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely
Give this song another listen
Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
What you do to me

Hey there, Delilah
I know times are gettin' hard
But just believe me, girl
Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good

Hey there, Delilah
I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you
Would take your breath away
I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall
We'd have it all

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me

A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes and trains and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'd just laugh along because we'd know
That none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time that we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame

Hey there, Delilah
You be good, and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school
And I'll be makin' history like I do
You know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there, Delilah, here's to you
This one's for you

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
What you do to me, oh oh, woah, woah
Oh woah, oh

Drivin' around while the radio played

Focused, not blind
And you said it too

Think of everything we haven't had
Like livin' in the Midwest Club
Goin' on our honeymoon in Paris
Makin' out when we're grown up
Listening to the best man speech
From Darren
Think of everything we had
Knowing how it feels to be in love
And kisses that would drive us mad
Going to the Metro
Giving up what we will
Never have again
Will it ever be the the two of us again?

This is my last call to you

A broke, a broke, a broken record,

She was hot file, 
She was low file, 
Burning up July, 
Everything was alright, 

Let me with a kiss, 
I wonder where she is, 
If that she ever miss me, 
Oh oh oh, 

Lovers and gears of common bomb, 
She'll always be my favorite song
She was silent gold, 
She was Rock'n'roll
I should have never let her go go go

I wished I could find her, 
Ooh oh oh, 
Cause I need to remind her, 
Ooh oh oh,

Would you pull the trigger and blow 'em away?

If I was a vampire, roaming the night
Would you be my prey and put your neck on the line?
Live in the shadows and die in the light?

Would you take a fall if we were under the gun
And drop down beside me in the nooses they've hung?

If I was the worst man in the world
Would you still be my girl?
The scariest monster you ever seen
Would you still love me?

And you're nothing but wrong for me.
So how do I get back to the good times?
And how do I see you in a new light?
Because the harder I try, the less we feel right for each other.
How do I get back to the good times?

And with my last breath I'll thank you for choking me
Because I'd rather suffocate than have you breathing down my neck.
Flowers and trees we planted the seeds,
But nothing will grow there.
'Cause we're going nowhere.

Because I'm nothing but good to you,

Ghosts in the graveyard, they come out at night
These are the wonders of the younger

Daydreams of castle and sad crystal balls
While your heroes on posters stand guard on your walls

And I wonder why we just leave it all behind
And I wonder how we could all go back right now

Werewolves and vampires are out for the kill
If none of them catch you, the Bogeyman will
These are the wonders of the younger

Walk in the plank of an old pirate ship
With a fistful of gold and kiss on your lips

When all I wanted to be was your giving tree
Settle down, build a home, and make you happy?

Whose covers you're between
And it's sad laying in his bed
You feel hollow, so you crawl home back to me

When all I wanted to be was your giving tree

A line of broken hearts behind you

Plain White T's,"Stuck in the moment at ten past nine.
Don't know if she's showing.
I wish she would tell me what was on her mind.
I can't stand not knowing.
Why am I here?

She used to say I was the love of her life.
Lately, she ain't showing.
I used to say, she's gonna make a good wife.
Where is this thing going?
Why am I here?
Why am I here?

Every word I write, I can't help losing myself.
Every kiss goodnight, I can't help losing myself.
I can't help losing myself in you.

Stuck in a moment, now it's 10:09
No way she is showing.
These games she play aren't even worth my time.
Where is this thing going?
Why am I here?
Why am I here?

Every word I write, I can't help losing myself.
Every kiss goodnight, I can't help losing myself in you.

Well you don't wanna let me go.
But you can't have it both ways.
Now, what can I do?
Cause I can't help falling.
And I can't stop calling you.
What can I do?

Every word I write, I can't help losing myself.
Every kiss goodnight, I can't help losing myself in you.
Every time we fight, I can't do anything right.
When we say goodbye, I can't help losing myself.

Plainsong,"No use crying, talking to a stranger
Naming the sorrows you've seen
Too many sad times, too many bad times
And nobody knows what you mean

Ah, but if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
And give them all to me
You would lose them, I know how to use them
Give them all to me

No use rambling, walking in the shadows
Trailing a wandering star
No one beside you, no one to hide you
Nobody knows where you are

No use gambling, running in the darkness
Looking for a spirit that's free
Too many wrong times, too many long times
Nobody knows what you see

No use roaming, lying by the roadside
Seeking a satisfied mind
Too many highways, too many byways
And nobody's walking behind",Pack Up Your Sorrows

Plan B,"She said I love you boy
I love your soul
She said I love you baby oh oh oh oh oh

She said I love you more than words can say
She said I love you bayayayayby

So I said, what you saying girl it cant be right
How can you be in love with me
We only just met tonight
So she said boy I loved you from the start
When I first heard love goes down
Something started burning in my heart
I said stop this crazy talk
And leave right now and close the door
She said but I love you boy I love you so
She said I love you baby oh oh oh oh oh
She said I love you more than words can say
She said I love you bayayayayby (yes you did)


So now up in the courts
Pleading my case from the witness box
Telling the judge and the jury
With the same thing that I said to the cops
On the day that I got arrested
Im innocent, I protested
She just feels rejected
Had her heart broken by someone shes obsessed with
'Cause she likes the sound of my music
Which makes her a fan of my music
That's why love goes down makes her lose it
'Cause she can't separate the man from the music
And I'm saying all this in the stand
As my girl cries tears from the galleries
Got bigger than I ever could have planned
Like that song by the Zutons Valerie
So the jury don't look like their buying it
And it's making me nervous
Arms crossed screw faced like im trying it
Their eyes fixed on me like a murder's
They wanna lock me up
And throw away the key
They wanna send me down

Even though I told them she

She said I love you boy
I love your soul
She said I love you baby oh oh oh oh oh (yes you did)

She said I love you more than words can sing
She said I love you bayayayayby

I've got my peeps then with me
And I'm having a blast
I'm feeling so fucking good right now
I want it to last

So I put my phone on silent
And I refill my glass
The music's so fucking banging
Feel like I wanna dance

I'm at the bar and I see this chick
Checking me out
From afar, yeah, she wants my dick
There ain't a doubt

She's got a skirt so short
Make you drool from the mouth
Looking my way as if to say
I'm in with a shout

So I pull a chair over there
And buy her a drink,
She says, ""Cheers"" I say, ""Yeah""

Now I'm being bad in the car
Rubbing this girl
Once the cab is paid
We make our way up to the hotel

Plan B,"The first day I saw her was at the train station
She was half black, half Caucasian
At first, yo, I thought she was Asian
But as I get a bit closer her origin in blatant
The best of both worlds, caramel complexion
And I swear when she smiled I almost, got an erection
Piercing green eyes, they shine like emeralds
When she, gave me the wink I could only think with my genitals
She tells me her name as soon as I approach her
It's Charmaine, Charmaine De la Rosa
I say, ""is that Spanish"" she says, ""yeah"" I say, ""kosher""
Whole time I'm imagining what it would be like to dose her
Train pulls up and we get on it together
Duration of the journey get to know each other better
We exchange numbers and agree to meet up afterwords
She blows me a kiss and with that I departed

Young girl, get out of my mind
My love for you, is way out of line
Young girl, get out of my mind
My love for you, is way out of line

One week and 20 pound phone credit later
I don't just wanna seduce this girl, now I wanna date her
She got a great personality and sense of humor
Next time we meet it just cant come any sooner
We arrange to go out for a drink at a bar
She's already there when I arrive and she looks the part
Even more stunning than I remember
Fuck it, drop-dead gorgeous
Her ass is tight and her breasts are bloody enormous
Hand in hand we walk over to the doorman
He's got a big shiny head yo he looks like George Foreman
He lets her through and asks me for i.D
I'm like ""what the hell you talking 'bout man, I'm 19!""
I whip my drivers license out and he lets me in
Then I trip over a step, how embarrassing
Charmaine let's to see it all but pretends not to see
I feel like a fool, she just thinks its sweet

Young girl, get out of my mind
My love for you, is way out of line
Young girl, get out of my mind
My love for you, is way out of line

The night goes a lot smoother than planned
Apart from the little hick-up at the start it's all gone grand
Whenever guys try to chat her up, she shows them the hand
Turns down every dance saying I'm her man
We get a cab back to my place where we get it on
I take off my shirt, she strips right down to the thong
I marvel at her body, voluptuous curves
Shes a real woman, no doubt about it, her 
Confidence is sky high
Shes the one who's got me on my back
Shes saying ""baby this is your night""
I'm like ""alright, its worth a go I suppose""
So, we switch roles and she takes full control
She starts slow, grinding me softly
Whilst kissing, yeah, shes doing me properly
Its when I start thinking, man
This girls gotta be from outta this world or something because she's shocking me
Never felt like this before this was more than sex
Sex was something that you had with skets
Something the next day you regret with a
Girl you wish that you had never met
Na ah, no way man, this had to be love
I couldn't believe I was saying it, but that's what it was
Like a leaf in the autumn, I had fallen
After that nothing else seemed important

Young girl, get out of my mind
My love for you, is way out of line
Young girl, get out of my mind
My love for you, is way out of line

So now it's time to hear my predicament, my catch 22
I loved this girl but now I have to cut her loose
So I was talking to one of my boys the very next day
And I, told him all about me and Charmaine
He looks at me in a very strange way
And asks me if De La Rosa is her surname
If shes, mixed race and her eyes are green
I say ""yeah"" he replies, ""blood, that girls fourteen""",Charmaine
Plan B,"You know what today I'm pissed off with you
'cos you've been acting childish t
When the fuck are you gonna grow up man and stopping having these fights with me
Deep down I know were cool sometimes I wonder would really give a fuck if you were six feet under
I look at you as a friend but when it comes down to it its blatant
Me and you ain't tight like the way you are with Jason
And you don't listen to me like the way you listen to him
That makes me think that you don't respect me that's how the dissin' begins
Every time we meet were at each others throats like a couple of bitches
I hate the way you try and go on, like a fuck that's some thick shit
I know one day you'll sort yourself out cos you ain't stupid
I just hope that, that day ain't that far away cos my life's moving at a fast rate
Picking up pace heading towards the right place I don't wanna leave you behind 
But I could feel my heart change 'cause as everyday goes by 
I start to realize who my friends are
If your one of them, prove it
Fix up

Couldn't get along today
We couldn't get along today
I'll have to call you back later
Couldn't get along today
Ooh yeah
Couldn't get along today

Once again my friend you managed to rattle someones cage
But for once it ain't mine yo, this time it's Dave's
Fuck me I thought we were bad but you and him are worst 
Falling out over petite shit like women, weed and birds
Talking about how if you never saw each other again it would be too soon
I cant really talk though cos sometimes I feel that way too
I'm just glad that me and you have sorted out our differences 
Now we can finally be on the level as you like to put it just settled
So hows your life man, lately you seem really down
What's it like living on that council estate in south
I know you got that big fuck of dog to protect you but that ain't your manor 
Man what's wrong with your head dude the way you got one blood, 
You need to be careful, ay don't give me that shit 'bout it being all cool 
Just be careful
Look I gotta go when your in the ends next make sure you check me
Alright bruv cool see you next week

Couldn't get along today
We couldn't get along today
I'll have to call you back later
Couldn't get along today
Ooh yeah
Couldn't get along today

Today I'm fucking distraught, I'm beside myself I cant stop crying man
Neither can no one else cos today I got a call from Greg
And the first thing he said was hey b your not gonna believe this man but Tony's dead
And at first I didn't, then I heard the tone in his voice, 
And I knew he was serious so I didn't have a choice
And suddenly it hit me and I went silent lost for words
As I listened to him describe how you died I felt this surge of overwhelming sadness
The fucking bastards why they have to kill you man its madness
I keep picturing your face its the first time I seen you 
Scared as I imagine you dropping from the balcony 
And you falling through the air 
I don't know whether you fell trying to escape or whether you was pushed off 
But whatever they did it was enough to get you more than shook up,
All I know is they turned up at your flat whilst you were sleepin' 
And seriously intended on giving you a beating
That bitch you lived with must ave had something to do with it 
As well she wanted you out of her yard
Why the fuck else would that dog of yours be locked in another room
I find it far too convenient that slag must ave knew 
That they was coming to do you something bad
I can't take this it's driving me mad I just can't believe your gone I never felt this sad
T I fuckin' love you man

Couldn't get along today
We couldn't get along today
I'll have to call you back later
Couldn't get along today
Ooh yeah
Couldn't get along today

Now that your gone don't think we'll ever be the same 
Your death was a tragedy in every kind of way
I can't comprehend all the time we wasted
On being angry at each other instead if just getting along, 
It's wrong and it reminds me of how you left it last with Dave, 
'cause when you died we didn't see his arse for days 
And those days turned to months 
And now those months have turned to years for me to be exact 
'cause still were holding back the tears
I said we haven't seen Dave for your years but we have 
Except it ain't really him 'cause the David we knew would never take crack or heroine 
Hit him hard just like it did with Jason, 
You and him were like brothers and in his heart lies and empty space 
'cause you'll never be replaced
And we all feel the same
What we have is love and respect when someone mentions your name
So know this just before I hang up the line for the last time
We love you
And your forever on our minds
See you in heaven bruv",Couldn't Get Along

Hi my name is Jack and I'm living proof of a dead man walking,
This spirit, this body that's still talking,
It's too late to take precautions my whole worlds already fallen apart,
Broke as easy as porcelain
And all because I didn't wear a hat when I fucked a yacht,
Now I wish I never even took her back to my flat,
I've been cursed from my dick to the hearse,
I can't think of nothing worse and it hurts,
'Cos all this pain I've inflicted on myself,
Always thought casual sex would do me good never bad for my health,
What a foolish thing to think,
If I had an ounce of heart left it would probably sink,

Seemingly there was nothing left for me too look forward to in this life

An insecure smack head running out of veins to inject,
Reality checks get me so upset, gonna make me realize
My life's a fucking mess and I ain't got no where to go
'cos my Family hates me, paranoia sets in and the
Whole worlds against me, so I buy another 20 bag of scag,
Take it all in one go like an arsehole being fucked by a fag,
And all my worries get washed away in an instant,
Yo as soon as the rush hits my brain there's a distance,
Between fact and fiction the truth hurts so much though
I've Become a slave to this addiction,
I owe dangerous people money I can't afford to pay,

I'm Only 27, court told me they'd knock it down to at least 11,

But things ain't looking good for me back at the scrubs,
Already caught up in world of violence and drugs,
Walked into

Came in as a man now its turning me out as a thug,

Already, one of them is dead the others close to recovering
And is after my head, there's nothing I can do now 'cos
I've Made my bed, just gonna have to lie in it and watch where I tread,

Reason I'm in here is 'cos I thought somehow that what
I was doing was right, when I loaded up that shotgun and
Attempted to end that mans life,

By her own boyfriend on the floor of her own kitchen

You'd Chop his balls of if you had the opportunity,
Cut his dick in half and leave him with only an inch to pee,
Only to find out That it was all in vain
'cos your dumb bitch of a sisters got back together with him again,
They're engaged to get Married,
You're going insane, contemplating a life in prison where you're
Gonna remain,
You're dead and buried'

Plan B,"Every morning when I wake
Every morning when I wake
This is my life everyday this is my life everyday
Wake up in the morning notice something ain't right
'cause although the sun is shinning there is no light

I open up my curtains wipe the sleep from my eyes to tired to realize I've lost my sight
Blinded by my ignorance I prepare my self for the day, 
Thinking this sinking feeling will go away
As I set off on my track the little voice in my head says turn back, 
But when I want to turn back it's too late
Darkness surrounds me drowning me in sorrow, 
'cause I know today will be no different from tomorrow
Hope is quickly fading soon I'll be too far gone for saving my soul will go and leave my body hollow
And still in the face of adversity I search for an inner strength 
Try and stand firm with both fists clenched
But I can't find my heart it's like the fuckin' thing's deserted me 
It used to be there this makes no sense
So I pray to a god that I'm not even sure if I believe in
To help me in my hour of need and keep me breathing
I pray to this god that created a place called Eden
A paradise to put Adam and eve in
But I don't think he hears me speaking
I'm starting to weaken
Now I'm reaching for what's fake
Poisoning my body to escape
Suddenly I'm overwhelmed with optimism my shoulders no longer feel the weight
Yeah life feels great but its fake.

Every morning when I wake
Every morning when I wake
This is my life everyday this is my life everyday
Wake up in the morning notice something ain't right
'cause although the sun is shinning there is no light

It's fake 'cause I know the smile on my face is only there 'cause I'm too intoxicated to care
That inside my soul I cant find no hope just a gaping whole where it used to be there
An amendable tear
That when I'm sober hurts more than I can bare
It just ain't fair
And soon I'll be back in normality
When the poison wears off and my whole bodies aching from the pain of reality
The pain of reality starts to grab at me
Love is a fallacy and I'm staring straight at death as it tries take another stab at me
I'm down on my knees
And I'm begging
Someone hear me please answer my questions
Why is my life just one big deep depression
Is this gods way of teaching me a lesson
Forgive me father for I have sinned
This is my confession
I do bad things and I don't know why I do them
I try to do good deeds but people see right through them
I can't get close to no one, 'cause they won't let me
How can I feel like a man if they don't respect me
Is that my heart?
I feel starting to sink
As the more I talk I'm starting to think
That maybe I feel this way because of the mistakes I've made 
And it ain't got shit to do with no one else
I can only blame myself
It's me who's bad for my health
And only I can rectify what is wrong in my life if only I tried a little bit harder
It all comes down to a choice what would I rather
Stay how I am and watch the days get darker or forgive myself, get on with my life
And not look back after",Everyday
Plan B,"Yeah. What’s up man? How longs it been?
How longs it been Dad? I don’t know. I’d say about

Sixteen years since you went searching for the holy ghost 
And got lost along the way like money in the post
Holier than most is how you used to act walking round 
With your Bible spitting out quotes like they were facts
Paint it black
Men women children as well
If you don’t worship god then you’re going to hell
Always had to take it one step further you couldn’t just pray nope’s
Had to shove it down peoples throats like gay blokes
Like that Basement Jaxx song where’s your head at
When did you lose your mind same time your hair fell out
And your beard started to grow grey hairs started to show 
Or was it when you started speaking in tongue on road
I was only six years old how could you subject me to that shit verbal syphilis
Complete fuckin' gibberish
I was sick of it but too afraid to say
Only saw you once a fortnight at of all of them you had to choose that day
To Bible bash evangelizing in the street
Looking like a tramp who collected trash
Even though you was ? you could have tried to look normal
Even if you was fucked in your head its awful
I know but I’m glad you done a disappearing act screw you
How could I ever introduce anyone to you
Baby this my dad he’s a religious nut. (Oh, hello, what the fuck!) 

I don’t hate you I don’t love you neither
You mean nothing to me (you're) just another geezer
I won't hit you
Still I won't hug you neither
If we ever meet again cold is how I’m gonna treat ya
If we ever meet again cold is how I’m gonna treat ya

When we talk about your antics now there always met with laughter. 
Did he really used to make you pray before you ate a mars bar?
Yes. Every time we put something in our mouths we had to pray to Jesus
Why the fuck you think I never used to eat Malteaser’s
I slag you off now and don’t feel bad about it afterwards
Just like all the other kids abandoned by their fathers
“I hate my dad, Homer Simpson look-a-like fat bastard!”
Yeah, well at least you weren’t stuck with Ned Flanders
Who the fuck was I supposed to go to for answers?
Hey mum what’s this sticky shit in my pyjamas?
You weren’t around to teach me shit
Sold your own kids for some ?
And no one’s seen you since
But I bet you turn up when I’m rich chatting shit
Like it weren’t your fault
Probably blame it on your bitch
'Cause your bitch mind's warped
We could here it in her voice every time she talked 
Me and Lauren were young but we weren’t dumb we knew what was going on
First time I met her when she was just your wife to be
I remember that something just didn’t seem right to me
From what I could see
It was simple and plain
She had you under manners like a dog on a chain
Sometimes I used to wonder where you were and why you left
Was it all because of her or what you thought was best
But times have changed and I’m used to you not being there 
So now I no longer wonder nor do I care
You could be dead for all I know
Even more fucked up in your head for all I know
'Cause all I really know is that you left without saying bye
And ain't ever looked back since. Yes there was a time, 
You could have built a bridge but now the gaps to great
And you might find if you try, it’ll just collapse under the weight
'Cause now its far too late 'cause we all grown up
How can you be part of our lives now when you’ve missed so much (that’s why!)

I don’t hate you I don’t love you neither
You mean nothing to me (you're) just another geezer
I won't hit you
Still I won't hug you neither

You can't run away from your past 'cause your past is hereditary
The blood that courses through my veins is your legacy
And will probably be the only thing ever left to me from you
'Cause just like you
I myself have been gifted with a musical talent
Except I go by the name of Ben Drew not Paul Balance
You lived your life like your namesake hung in the balance
Then you fell off the wagon and now the only thing that’s apparent is
You ain't half the man you used to be
But I am more than you could ever be
'Cause you could never see the world as I see it
Where as you try to be something you ain't, I be it
And real fast your past is coming back to haunt you
It's God's will that such a big mistake like me should taunt you
Daunt you
Like a nervous feeling in your gut
I call it fate, but you can call it whatever the fuck you want
Your just a lost little boy so here’s one less worry for ya
I don’t hate you
I just feel sorry for ya
In fact I pity you
I got so much shit on you
If I saw you on the street, I wouldn’t even spit on you

But I don’t hate you. Hating takes too much effort, 
And you ain't worth the fuckin' time of day. 
As for love, that went when you went. Long ago",I Don't Hate You

So pass me a glass of ice and fill it up with liquor,
Make sure you make it a double so I get drunk quicker.
Only drink spirits, don't give a fuck about my liver;
The only reason I don't drink pints is 'cause I'm trying to watch my figure.

Quote 'Plan B will never last.'
That's why I chuckle when they get signed then they buckle,
'cause they cant take the pressure never the less I still laugh.
Believe I ain't no quitter, nor would I be bitter if my label dropped me I'd just go on sicker, change my name to Kunt

Throw a punch, make your nose crunch and your lip bust so blood shines off your lips boss,

Just gimmme one mic and one mic stand, one guitar for me to strum with my right hand.
The same right hand that'll pick up a knife and start to slice mans,
Make them die a painful death such as a slow one, 'cause I don't need no-one

'Coz I've had it up to here, right up to here
Might ave to do it reservoir dogs style slice of their ear
'Coz I've had enuff of bredders actin' tough, tryin' ta get rough
When its obvious they ain't rough enuff, listen

I don't just talk the talk, I walk it
That's why my mouth's always comin' out with raw shit
My rap style's distorted like lil' mo getting rapped
And keepin' the baby instead of gettin' it aborted

Yo, I talk morbid just to make you feel awkward
Deaths a part of life, yo, you just can't ignore it
Especially when I rip out your heart and on my sleeve sport it like
Somethin' you feel precious 'coz ya dead gran bought it

I talk so foul, I talk so course, I show no regret
I show no remorse like a necromanic raping a corpse
Up the anal passage while contracting genital warts

My metaphor's are twisted like that game
Where you gotta put that hob nob in ya gob
If you the last one to come on the biscuit
I'm so sadistic so I fantasize about finding
My mums ex floating in a bath tub with his wrists slit

And I'm real sick hearing these pricks talk shit

When its obvious they ain't rough enuff

Check it, the last verse is just as bad as the first
Compared to the second, yo, it's definitely worse

Let me do what Nas did and tell that shit in reverse

The hirst brings the corpse back to the morgue
The guy from the morgue undresses the corpse
Embalming fluid goes back out, the blood goes back in
Body goes back to hospital where it comes alive again

The paramedics walk backwards like an Irish dance
Put the wounded man back in the ambulance
The ambulances engine turns back on
And its lights flash as it plays his favorite song

The guy goes back to the exact spot where they found him
And the medics and and all the passers by go back
Where they came from till eventually
No one surrounds him and the blood pours up him
Rather than down him

The man then falls upwards back on his feet
Stumbles towards a dark figure on the other side of the street
He walks into the blade that cut his belly
Then he holds his neck which was bleeding already

He removes his hand so you can see the cut
And as the knife undoes the slice, it closes back up
He unsays the words he said which were, 'What the fuck'
And unscreams the scream from the first initial cut

Then the blood from he severely severed ear
Crawls back up his cheek and slowly disappears
As the knife wielding silhouette unhacks it from the rear
Puts the knife away after reattaching the ear

Then walks backwards thought the bushes
Where he's disregarded nature
Who's the guy on the bench, I'm reading his paper
Takes the snail he stepped on back from its creator
Only to be killed again when I fast forward this shit later

Back in his house now back in his bed
He un-listens to a CD and un-bops his head
Take's the CD out the player and puts it back in its case
Which has my name on the cover along with my face

Fast forward, there's been a murder
And the police know who's done it
Not lookin' for a motive 'coz they don't know why he done it
Sure enough it don't take that long for them to find a reason
And they publicly state it on TV that evening

A couple of months later, this shit gets banned
Like it was me who put that switch in his hand
And told him to kill that man

Like this whole song was just some kinda sickly devised plan
To hurt some poor cunt I don't even know
And I've never met before in my life

The words whoever said, ""The pen is mightier than the sword""
Was right and you better think twice
Before you step to me and pick a fight

Plan B,"Let me tell you a story.
It's called tough love.

Once upon a time there was a girl called Sonita.
Dreaded goin' home after school 'cause her dad would mistreat her.
Her mum was just as bad, when she got mad, 
was more than glad to lend a hand in helping him beat her.

Sonita, used to wear the cloth of her religion.
Sonita, used to pray to God, thought he was listening.
But nothin' ever changed, at least she couldn't see a difference.
So the relationship between them both became distant.
She didn't agree with the fundamental religious views of her parents. 
Might as well have been speaking gibberish. 
To her, it was incoherent. 
She was livin' in the Western world, 
Couldn't understand why she couldn't be like all the other Western girls.

So one day she rebels. 
Walks into a shop and purchases a copy of Bliss.
A magazine for female teenagers.
Ripped off the plastic rapper, started flickin' through the pages.

Tough love, tough love. 
I call it hatred.
Tough love, tough love.
I call it hatred.
You call it tough love, I call it hatred.
That's your flesh, your blood, that's sacred.

Tough love, tough love. 
I call it hatred.
Tough love, tough love.
I call it hatred.
You call it tough love, I call it hatred.
That's your flesh, your blood, that's sacred.

So engrossed in her new found interest, Sonita fails to realize the time.
Before she knows it, it's a quarter to nine.
Should've been back from prayer an hour ago.
Now her parents are gonna know that she's skived.
In the slim hope that they won't,
She hides the copy of Bliss inside the books under her arm and makes her way back home.

She opens the door to find her mum and dad waiting.
The expressions on both of their faces is scathing.
Before she has time to think of an excuse,
Her father's hands are right round her neck like a noose.
So tight he chokes her.
She drops all her books on the floor except the Bliss mag which lands on the sofa.
Dad can't control his rage when he sees that the centre page is a boy band poster.
""She's possessed by the devil!""
Her mother shouts.
Blaming it on Satan, like it's the only explanation.
Grabs Sonita by the hair, down to the basement.
Hearts racing like she knows her life's about to be taken.
They look her in the eyes, say,
""Here's what we're gonna do. 
You've been possessed by a demon,
We're gonna beat him out of you.""

Sonita cries for help.
She sees her mum pick up a broomstick and her dad take off his belt.
It's no use, her brothers and sisters won't listen.
Undeterred, her parents carry out the exorcism.

Tough love, tough love. 
I call it hatred.
Tough love, tough love.
I call it hatred.
You call it tough love, I call it hatred.
That's your flesh, your blood, that's sacred.

Tough love, tough love. 
I call it hatred.
Tough love, tough love.
I call it hatred.
You call it tough love, I call it hatred.
That's your flesh, your blood, that's sacred.

For hours they violently torture their daughter.
Beat her until an inch of her life until it's right on the border.
They continue to physically haunt her but now Sonita has a mental disorder.
She no longer cares if she lives or dies.
Absolutely no more tears left to cry.
She's evilness in her parents eyes.
And thinks they're the ones who need to be exorcised.

That's when the rebellious streak completely intoxicates her.
Sudden rush of energy boosts a never before seen aggressive nature.
She decides that no matter what they are never gonna break her.
""Go to hell!"" she screams at her dad as he goes to give her another lick with the belt.
""Go fuck yourself!"" she screams at her mum, knowing that it's only gonna spur her on.
'Cause now Sonita's lost the plot.
The physical pain ain't nothing compared to the heartache when the heart breaks and it rots.
Once filled with so much love.
But now it's so clogged up with hate that it stops beating and she stops breathing.
Her body's just a carcass now, her soul's leaving.
No more pain.
No more bleeding.
Die slow, blow by blow from a severe beating.
It only takes half a dozen more blows to the head before they finally realize that she's dead.

That's when the door busts open and in come the FEDS.
The neighbours must've called them 
When they heard the screams of torment coming from the basement where Sonita's body lay.
Blatant like road kill out on the pavement.
It's quite clear to the police 
That she's been the victim of a horrific case of physical mutilation.

Tough love, tough love. 
I call it hatred.
Tough love, tough love.
I call it hatred.
You call it tough love, I call it hatred.
That's your flesh, your blood, that's sacred.

Tough love, tough love.
I call it hatred.
Tough love, tough love.
I call it hatred.
You call it tough love, I call it hatred.
That's your flesh, your blood, that's sacred.

After being apprehended,
Sonita's parents were asked why their daughters life was so brutally taken.
They said it was out of love.
But only hate breaks something so hard it can never be mended.
To this day they show no remorse.
Their idea of parental guidance will always be to use force.
And what makes this tale even more gory is that this song is based on a true story.
Tough love
I rest my case.
This is a fucked up world.
It's all fucked",Tough Love
Plan B,"(Where you from?)
I'm from a place were the streets are filled with snakes
That smile in your face as they plot to do wrong.
(Where you from?)
I'm from a town where the mans will take you down
If they see you making pounds and flashing it around like you the don
('Cause where I'm from?)
They don't give a fuck if you got talent,
Only got love for your bank balance like, ""Give me the wrong!""
(That's where I'm from)
Don't ever get it twisted.
Yeah I'm really, really from the ends now what the fuck you want?

I'm walking down the street, past the coppers on the beat
Past the shooters blotting weed
Clear for everyone to see, but no-one gives a D,
'Cause this is everyday life.
Fuck the police
It's a ghetto state of mind,
'Cept where I'm living I can't see no ghetto, 
This ain't America, it's England, where we live ain't nothing special.
You can take anywhere and call it a ghetto,
Same way you make cyanide, same way you make amaretto.
Hip-hop's in the street, now were all busting
50 Cent's on MTV, now it's cool to carry metal
Objects,
Now the object is to kill.
How can you value life when you're so close to death? Stainless steel,
How's it make you feel,
Blud, holding that buckey?
Knowledge is power, guns just make you feel lucky.
It's fuckry the way these yout' man like to go on,
Busting shots in the crowd when there's a show on, they're just putting a show on.
Real gangsters stay underground like non-fiction,
They don't fire blanks at Yanks like when Nas played at Brixton.
Thrill seeking dickheads just doing it for kicks and
Hear a next man speak their name from his lips and
Give a guy props for licking shots from a gun 
Like if they fired one at him the fucking prick wouldn't run. 
It's like they're praising these youths for acting so dumb and it's no excuse,
Most of us are fatherless sons.

I'm from these ends, they call it the East end, my friend,
And round here you gotta watch your back 'cause everyone's bent,
Bare man who think they're rough just 'cause they're shooting the peng,
Hating on Plan B 'cause they don't know me as Ben.
Youths as young as ten walking round thinking they're men.
They're under the influence, and I ain't even talking 'bout drugs,
I'm talking bout why the fuck they're walking like thugs.
They're in love with the idea of being a gangster,

Leave you looking like a chief.

Plan B,"When trouble comes knockin' I'll be ready alright
Put my fists up, ready to fight
But I ain't gotta put my fists up every time
Who needs actions when you got, you got words?

And I ain't gotta pull the heat like here we go
I ain't gotta lose my head like years ago
Who needs actions?

Who needs actions when you got words
That ain't afraid to get physical
It's just that I hit harder when I spit on the verse
'Coz I'm a sick spitter, spit so sick that it hurts
So sick of spittin' I can even spit in reverse

Still you can step up to my face if that's the way that you feel
Throw a punch, I'll throw one back an show you one for real
Lost a lot of so-called mates since I signed this record deal

One more wanker bringin' hate won't matter now I'm payin' bills
No stayin' still waitin' for a giro
Feelin' so frustrated I could stab someone in the eye with a biro
Havin' to drive slow every time I see the 5 0
'Coz there's a nine bar of skunk in my trunk an it's lipo

Used to shot the high grade pen
So I'm used to cats that beg for scraps
And cat crack that don't make sense
Kai was true due even when you go to great lengths
I see through you like glass and fake friends

When trouble comes knockin' I'll be ready alright
Put my fists up ready to fight
But I ain't gotta put my fists up every time
Who needs actions when you got, you got words?

And I ain't gotta pull the heat like here we go
I ain't gotta lose my head like years ago

Sticks and stones break bones but what I say'll hurt you worse
Leavin' you feelin' dead an' buried like you're six feet under earth
And if actions speaker louder than words
How come I hear you hatin' but I never see you burst

You just vex 'coz you just wish you were Ariah
You can't mix with any people for your set like I can
Pick up a mic hand, set the crowd alight man
Shine so fuckin' brightly they think it's day when it's night man

That's right, man, you can't deny I've got talent
It's jealousy, you only hatin' 'coz you haven't
The more I blow, the more you hate me wiv a passion
Now they press on my dick an people follow me like fashion

Well, I don't believe the hype, well that's all it is an nuttin' else
But I don't need the hype the words are right to sell themselves
'Coz the words are written from the heart that's why they're felt
And you'll be eatin' yours, an mine are flyin' off the shelf

When trouble comes knockin' I'll be ready alright
Put my fists up, ready to fight
But I ain't gotta put my fists up every time
Who needs actions when you got, you got words?

And I ain't gotta pull the heat like here we go
I ain't gotta lose my head like years ago

I'd rather merk mans lyrically, spray them wiv spit from my tongue
Than goin' on a killin' spree and livin' life on the run
Even if sometimes I do feel like gettin' a gun
And runnin' up on everyone who hated me from day one

But what's the point in that? It's ironic where the point be at
Haters from the heart, still the head is where I point the gat
Imagine how your face looks as I cock it back
Pull the trigger, imagine how your face looks after that

But it ain't worth it, bro, hey yo, I ain't thick
Even though I hear it teens say it too much, it makes me sick
Come across so many fools don't make me wanna switch
I won't ruin my career just because you said some shit

I'll dead you quick, on the mics if you keep on beefin'
Think you're gettin' to me, na blood you ain't even
I'm a leave it so I maintain a cool balance
And you mean nuttin' to me that's poor balance

When trouble comes knockin' I'll be ready alright
Put my fists, up ready to fight
But I ain't gotta put my fists up every time
Who needs actions when you got, you got words?

And I ain't gotta pull the heat like here we go
I ain't gotta lose my head like years ago

With her hand on the Bible, where was the lightning?
The great vengeance, furious anger that Samuel.
L.J. made sound so frightening
She attempted to poison a brother
And I mean it in a Biblical sense, not a black way
She succeeded to destroy that brother
It's deep; you can make a fool battle out of laughing
She just did it for the money for the cash, eh?
I bet she's rolling in it now she's famous
You must think that's fair considering

I was being attacked on a daily basis
I had to do something
And it weren't like you were going to intervene at any
Point 'cause you never do nothing
Just I thought you'd sent me an angel
When the second man tried put the first cut in
And got stabbed instead, but now I know
That was just in my head, not the hole that I'm stuck in
'cause if he really was an angel you sent
He wouldn't be trapped in this jail with me

'Cause I don't go outside for nothin', no one
Is gonna make me leave this room
Oh no they can't tell me nothin', no way, no way, yeah
Can't tell me nothin'
They can't tell me nothin'
They can't tell me nothin'

Sitting here by myself looking mad at myself thinking ""I don't wanna go out there""
I don't need no help, looking after myself, I got everything I need right here
I ain't trying to impress anyone in this cesspit jail I just don't care
I ain't gotta smell fresh for a woman so I'm blessed not washing my skin or my hair
They can call me a recluse, they ain't gonna remove or cut me loose from this place, I'm locked in hiding
Like a rocker wall moves 'cause you know I've gotten used to the space that I'm occupying
There really ain't anything out there on the win they'd enjoy more more than see me crying
So I do it in my room where none of these goons can see me though I know they've been trying
I ain't cut out for this shit, I'm a coward I admit, I've never been no big ting
The thought of killing makes me sick, but I don't wanna be no victim no way not Strickland
So I just stay in my cell like I'm bricked in and hope that stops me from getting kicked in
Even if it earns me this nickname in prison

Oh yeah they call me 'The Recluse'
'Cause I don't go outside for nothin', no one
Is gonna make me leave this room
Oh no they can't tell me nothin', no way
Oh yeah they call me 'The Recluse'
'Cause I don't go outside for nothin', no one
Is gonna make me leave this room
Oh no they can't tell me nothin'",The Recluse
Plan B,"I know what's to come,
Though I'm feelin happy now,
I know when I'm drunk,in ways it always lets me down,
Cos I always stay too long,
Long enough for something to go wrong,
I'm in a a brawl,
Because I won't take your lying now,
The writing's on the wall,
The Police are on they're way right now.
Cos I always stay too long,
Long enough for somthing to go wrong,
Yeah I always stay too long,
It's better late instead of singing my
S-s-song,
S-s-song,
S-s-s-s-song-song,
S-s-song.

I've got my peeps there with me shouting pull up your socks,
Cos we just broke the law and now were running from cops,
I got my lip bust fighting,
Now there's blood on my top,
And I'm still out looking for,
A party,
Somewhere to stop,
I've got my peeps then tellin me they know where it's at,
So I pull out twenty notes and jump straight into a cab,
I'm on my way to where i'm going thinkin I need more Jack,
But that probably aint the brightest idea I've ever had,
'cause..

I always stay too long,
Long enough for something to go wrong,
(Hey!)
On a run from the law,
I'm lookin' worse for wear,

I go for a door,
Suddenly I find myself somewhere,
Something's bound to go wrong,
If I stay too long,
I know I'm gotta get to dawn,
Before I start singin my s-s-song,

Ah c'mon,
C'mon,
C'mon,

I've got my peeps then with me at the bar doing shots,
Cos now we're so fucking plastered we don't know when to stop,
I've got my girlfreind ringing me,
Belling me up,

I know I should probably answer but I just can't be fucked,
I've got my peeps then with me and i'm havin a blast,
I'm feeling so fucking good right now,
I want it to last,
So I put my phone on silent,
And I refill my glass,
The music's so fucking banging feel I wanna dance,
I'm at the bar and I see a chick checking me out,
Form afar yeah she wants my dick there aint a doubt,
She's got a skirt so short,
It makes you drool from the mouth,
Looking my way as if to say i'm in with a shout,
So I pull a chair over there and buy her a drink,
She says 'Cheers' I say 'yeah' , our glasses go clink
Now I'm being bad in the car rubbing this girl,
Once the cab is paid we make my way up to the hotel,
Now I'm in the lift,
Getting lips,
Go nice and slow,

But do I care? Do I fuck! I'm on a roll,
Yo!
Aaaaaaaah!",Stay Too Long
Plan B,"There's people inside
Telling me to watch my back
If I wanna survive
I gotta stop them in their tracks

They've been making life hard
They've been taking me for a fool

And I traded them in for a tool

Pay the price for her mistakes

But she was a sweet fiend never the less

The past lived in the dark parts of the brain
And only heroin seemed take away the pain
So she folded at the voyeur and lit the flame

Just not the name of only herself to blame

Plan B,"Mr drug dealer
Mr drug dealer
Mr drug dealer

The night is ‘75 there was this chick named Janet 
A pregnant heroin addict who said she didn't plan it
So never thought to stop, or ever kick the habit
'Cause Kirby let her do it and she knew he always had it
Down in his cellar with Trevor another addict
Who was at it like an asthmatic trapped in an attic
Sucking on an asthma punt 
Though you never know by looking at him that's the cunt
Who by 1983 was in the national front
Yeah he had a shaved head but still got mashed on drugs
So Kirby didn't mind him hanging round that much
Especially anytime Janet came round to fuck
Get her fix while her kid Chris waited around
A nine year old boy he was healthy and loud
'Cause even when she was pregnant she was smoking around
And she was ducking that he wasn't born disabled somehow

Still when you're too loud you get a clap round your head
Kirby ain't his dad but he does what he says
Stays downstairs in the cellar with Trev
While Kirby's upstairs giving Janet her meds
At least that's what they tell Chris still he ain't that dumb
He knows Kirby's upstairs banging his mum
While he's left in the basement with some racist cunt
Who's been waiting round for ever for his mother fuckin' day to come

Mr drug dealer

What an environment to raise a kid
Round crack dealers, heisters and racist pricks
Trevor, looted the place as well as maiming Chris
Left a permanent scar on his face the same as his
With a, razor blade yeah takes the piss
Whether you prejudice or not man he's just a kid
But that's what Trevor done no one ever saw him after that
6 years past now Kirby's hookin' up the crack
It's the new drug everybody's going crazy for
1989 the year Chris started selling draw
Picking up from Kirby, scar there beneath his eye
Think after everything that's happened he would treat him right
But par him off with just another ounce of weed
'Cause a quarter of the bag is a bunch of fuckin' seeds
Hundreds of them and twigs the size of fuckin' trees 
But if he ever moaned he get a slap across his cheek

1990 is the year that really took it's toll 
'Cause that's the year his mother Janet took an overdose 
Of heroin and died, god rest her tortured soul
Now he's left to fend for himself or by his own

Mr drug dealer

it's 1995, now that he's older stress weighs on his shoulders
Heavy as boulders, but he hides it from his olders
He's been living on the far side since he was a youth
But the way he lives now is a far cry
From the way he, did in the past 'cause he's
Made his way up from sellin' ounces to bars of weed
Out In the streets, where people do their nasty deeds 
He sees ‘em making money so he wants a larger piece
He's a man now, 21 years of age
It's been a couple years since Kirby's palms were raised
Lost in anger, ended up across his face 'cause he's a man now
And Kirby knows he's past his stage of gettin' beats
Still that don't change the way he treats
Chris when he comes round to his, to get his weed
Kirby don't like his attitude he's cocky now believe
So again he palms him off with more twigs and fuckin' seeds

But Chris ain't havin' none of it he ain't no little kid now
He squares up to Kirby who really don't look that big now
And really can't do shit now but pay Chris what he owes
And weed but also pride 'cause that what Chris takes when he goes
Kirby knows he's getting old, and that's what really hurts
He ain't cut out for this work the way he once was upon a time
But he don't know no other way to make a living on the grind	
Selling drugs is all he's been, his only way of getting by

Then the cops come round undercover fed come shut him down, lock him down
15 years away from now, the youth will grow, a big and strong and take control
Have it ah, that's the way it goes

Plan B,"It was an ordinary day, people walking, all over me again
Then suddenly to my dismay out of no where my heart started talking to my brain
What a great day for a murder but I'm not in a killing mood
What a great day to reek vengeance but I know it will do no good

What a great day to go and get a gun
Go and take your anger out on every one
If your out of ammunition
Go and buy the sun, and read up on all the council housed and violent scum 
Still pissing tax payers money up the wall
You can barely just about to send your kids to school
What with the cost of living been so sky high 
The petrol station selling gas at such a high price
With that in mind, your heads in such a vexed place 
What more excuse ya need to turn into a head case
And the newspaper for me get me in such a vexed state
Kill a man with your bare hand even if your best mates
'Cause if you believe every word the press says 
You cant appreciate the pair of tits on the next page
Then yes I guess today must really be the best day
To go and get a gun shoot someone in the head mate 

What a great day for a murder but I'm not in a killing mood
What a great day to reek vengeance but I know it will do no good

Looking at the sun will make you go blind just like people say
Cost you your sight when it's 30p a day
Now your looking in the mirror not seeing it's double glazed 
Spying on your neighbors through darkened shades 
Another broken family killed and roamed free
Look in every front yard of every house on the street 
While the gardener is gardening the males planting seeds
Another single mum before me different boyfriends every week
Daughters are reading now old dears feeling heat
Her sons just like the beano catching ass for cheek
Young ones with their nuts out blowing in the breeze
What a bunch of fucking animals the type can only see

In the section of the zoo magazine said oh
Just lying on the page is like a lion in a cage 
She's seen enough, time to take her braces 
Action with a shotgun wave it in people faces
Today's as good as any there's nothing better then been famous 
You could be the next Raoul moat and mike skinner as you agent 
He started on mild steeds exploring ain't he
Simply by shooting all his neighbors and made the front page in all the papers
Standing about observed it's all about
You cant look any where about the murder in his eyes
But there's no point in killing everybody you despise
Over something you read, 'cause half the shit you read is lies
Yeah that's right half the shit you read is lies but you still let it lead your life

It was an ordinary day, people walkin' gall over me again
Then suddenly to my dismay my heart started talking yeah started talking to my brain it said
What a great day for a murder but I'm not in a killing mood
What a great day to reek vengeance
But I know it will do no good

So now that you know your so influenced about things you read
That it determines how you treat different people you meet
The though of murdering a journalist but prepared to get sucked to ya seat
Must seem so sweet if ya happen to pass one in the street 
But you wont as you ain't as hard to do so 
Only fantasize bout what would happen if you where to loose it

Now it's so multicultural no one speaks properly
Rhyming slang was invented on the docks to put a block on police
Now the docks ain't there and no one cares 'cause they shotting B
But still talking code like Morse, it ain't no mock-ney
But educated people still see it as a mockery

That's why they use our slang against us to be derogatory
We just fuel the fire with our thugged-out philosophies
Like crime's the only way we're gonna feed off this economy
Revert to type, like these self fulfilling prophecies
But we ain't no different from them, honestly

It’s the manor person you’ve ever met in your manor

But then its not all as black and white as it seems
There all some way enslaved in there circumstances.

That’s why these kids ain’t got no hope,
Walking round there estates thinking this is it,
They ain’t ever getting out and it’s no joke
Probably is the best of live there ever gonna get.
They don’t believe they can succeed
Or the opportunities you send back there really exist
'Cause they’ve been told from every day from the minute they were born by there fucked up parents that they ain’t shit.
Mum and dad never made anything of them selves
Na, so why the hell are they gonna?

Schools a waste of time, there only gonna fail
There older brother went jail, why ain’t they gonna?
I mean the hang with thugs, they sell drugs
Ain’t afraid to put a couple slugs in you if you say something
They ain’t all that way but you don’t care either way

Then he gave them eyes and told them both to both believe
Something they’d actually physically see
And then the devil came along and planted a seed
And down started growing from the ground like trees
Right up to the sky so profoundly seen
To be the only thing in this life that wasn’t a dream
Made from stone still and iron beams
The council blocks to defining mean
And bullied the sky so that everybody can see
Some birds are caged and will never be free
And gradually people began to change there beliefs
Until god was nothing more than just a fictional being
The worship and money merged all colours and creed
Into one true religion that was driven by greed
Corporate machines trying to sell you shit you don’t need
On television and the ad breaks in between
Until people only cared about material things
Not lives with other fellow human beings

To do desperate mells, within themselves

Si se imagina me imagino nos vamos a comer

Si yo pudiera saber lo que hay en tu mente
Si tu mirada me dice que eres caliente
Que te pones tímida delante de la gente
Simulando

Que hace mucho tu me gustas es evidente
Olvídate de lo que tus amigas dicen
Que sus palabras no son suficientes
Porque te demoras, porque te detienes

Se que quieres, se te nota
Al hablarme, al mirarme
No puedes engañarme
Aeh, aeh, aeh, aeh, aeh,
Aeh, aeh, aeh, aeh,
Con el Plan B

Se que quieres, se te nota
Al hablarme, al mirarme
No puedes engañarme

Soy el que la explota
Que cantando te sube la nota
Cuando el Plan B canta, el party se alborota
Y todas las féminas se ponen bien loca
Locas, toas vinieron a lucir su ropa

Se pone linda, me gusta como ella se pinta
Se hace la difícil y después se lo chi
En la disco o en los carros o en cualquier lugar
Lo importante es complacerte y también aventurar

Solo invítala, que yo se que a ella le va a gustar
Llévatela a pasear, que yo se que es liberal
En el sexo inmortal, con su flow natural
Como culebra, con una furia bestial

Se que quieres, se te nota
Al hablarme, al mirarme
No puedes engañarme
Aeh, aeh, aeh, aeh, aeh,

Plan B,"Que me paso
Que me sucedió oh oh
Que me envolvió oh oh
Pensando que era una aventura
Pero todo cambio
Me hipnotizo oh oh
Me enamoro oh oh
Detalle a detalle ella mi amor gano

Ya yo no se en mi lo que pasa
Ahora siempre estoy en mi casa
Porque siento que ella me ama
Ya no duermo solo en mi cama

Ya yo no se en mi lo que pasa
Ahora siempre estoy en mi casa
Porque siento que ella me ama
Ya no duermo solo en mi cama

Tu me capturaste
Me desconectaste
Ya no soy yo tu me cambiaste
No ha habido una que me quitara mi arte
De ser un tipo normal y te la jugaste
Y me gusta como tu me tratas

Cuando me miras, me besas y me hablas
De la forma como toca usted lo gana
Y en el party luces tu como mi gata

Y me gusta como tu me bailas
Todos te miran pero tu duermes en mi casa
Yo soy el que le da uba uba guaca
Y cuando tienes frio yo la arropo en la cama

Ya yo no se en mi lo que pasa
Ahora siempre estoy en mi casa
Porque siento que ella me ama
Ya no duermo solo en mi cama

Ya yo no se en mi lo que pasa
Ahora siempre estoy en mi casa
Porque siento que ella me ama
Ya no duermo solo en mi cama

Yo quisiera que
Tu la vieras como ella dispone para mi
Nunca dice no siempre me dice a mi que si
Me cocina, enciende velas siempre junto a mi
Haciendo el amor hasta morir

Yo soy difícil de envolver
Pero ahora no se que voy a hacer porque esa mujer
Me hizo cambiar de parecer y capturo mi ser
Y no te quiero perder
Me tienes adicto a todo tu cuerpo girl

Que me paso
Que me sucedió
Que me envolvió
Pensando que era una aventura
Pero todo cambio
Me hipnotizo
Me enamoro
Detalle a detalle ella mi amor gano

De hacer el amor con ella
Y en ocasiones me confundo
Y no sé ni que pensar
Pasan los días y yo sigo sin saber de ella
Vivo el momento sé que algún día va a terminar
Va a terminar

Porque el amor no existe,
No existe
Porque el amor no existe,
No existe

Hey!
El amor es raro
Demasiado caro
Como el dinero de mano en mano
Si no me crees chequea tu pasado
Cuántas veces te has enamorado
Pero el verdadero no llega
Y el tiempo no para de correr
Y tu sigues dando candela
Y a mi me tratas de envolver
Los dos queremos sexo, placer
Tener contacto de piel
Así es que nos gusta
Porque el amor asusta

Tu amor es viento
Viento que pasa
Hoy te tengo, no sé mañana
Miedo al fracaso
Vives un juego
Yo te comprendo

Porque el amor no existe,
No existe

Porque el amor no existe,
No existe

No es casualidad
La química que tenemos tu y yo en la intimidad
Como una amistad
El poco tiempo que tu y yo pasamos en realidad
Pero todo es suspenso
(Suspenso!)
Cada día más intenso
(Intenso!)
Pero como te convenzo
Te dejas llevar por eso
Tú y tu cualidad
Hace que me sienta que me quieres de verdad
Mientras tanto
Me vivo el momento por si algún día te vas

Tu amor es viento
Viento que pasa
Hoy te tengo, no sé mañana
Miedo al fracaso
Vives un juego
Yo te comprendo

Porque el amor no existe,
No existe
Porque el amor no existe,
No existe

En el olvido quedan las promesas y las palabras
(Las Palabras!)
Es sencillo
(Easy!)
La ilusión viene y va porque el amor se acaba y la
Atracción termina
(Termina!)
Porque en la vida nada es para siempre
(Nada!)
Esta canción es para los que viven día a día como yo
Porque siempre se sufre por amor
Pero siempre buscamos enamorarnos

De una noche, de un intento

Tu mente me llama me llama
Y yo le contesto
Mi mente descansa y con el deseo la alimento
Yo sé que estamos cerca de que pase el suceso
De una historia, de un recuerdo

Es un secreto
Que tu mirada y la mía
Un presentimiento
Como un ángel que me decía

Tu sabes que naciste pa' mí
Tu eres mi gusto mi flow
Lo mismo te pasa a ti
Cuando estás cerquita de mí
El deseo es tanto
Que llevas por dentro
Sin decir nada haciéndolo lento
Mientras me desleito
Aprovecha el momento
Mami! mami!

Tu eres una barbie

Y no es de mattel
Tu eres perfecta

Me dejaste solo, solo con mi querer
Jugaste con mi mente, jugaste con mi ser

Que me devolviera tu amor

Tanto, lindos momentos

La veo en la disco casi todos los weekends
Al parecer en su casa no hay quien la frene
El vacilón de ella comienza desde el jueves
Tiene un amigo en el barrio al parecer no la entretiene

Se hace la boba sabe que lo que le conviene
Su abuela le da money cada vez que quiere
Está solita ella no quiere que la celen
Muchos la han querido para serio pero a ella le va y le viene

Pide que la empuje, que el pelo le desordene
Que la encadene que a la cama la condene
El comentario se ha regado que ella gana por knock out
Al parecer ella invicta se mantiene

Se pone cranky si lo hago romantic

Kinky nasty y aunque sea fancy
Se pone cranky si lo hago romantic
Le gusta el sexo en exceso
Y en el proceso me pide un beso

Ella es diferente no vive con la gente
Y no le hace caso si le saca el expediente
Y todos quieren probarla porque dicen que es caliente
Un filling una cerveza para entrar en ambiente
Baila todas las canciones y tiene un swing cuando se mueve
Y no tiene amigas deja que todas la envidian
Dice maldita la mujer en que otra mujer confía
Por eso se rodea de amiguitos todos los días

Esa nena que tú ves ya no es una chamaquita
Aunque la veas con carita de nenita
Ya medio barrio la ha probado
Dicen que el novio esta trancado
En la calle por eso es que anda bien loquita
La abuela de ella jura que es una angelita
Insulta a todo el que hable mal de su nietecita
Aunque al medio la han tirado a ella no le ha importado
Sigue con el vacilón y no se quita

Le gusta a lo kinky nasty y aunque sea fancy
Se pone cranky si lo hago romantic
Le gusta el sexo en exceso
Y en el proceso me pide un beso

Tus manos temblaban, tus labios igual 
Como una atracción fatal 

Y yo me acuerdo que del comienzo y del final 
Que la sensación, que los sentidos paralizar 
Y poco me entragaste tu boca endulzando en mi paladar 
Y sin pensar me puse a actuar, rapido pude notar 
El deseo entre tus piernas, que no pude acariciar 
No me dejaste expresar, nunca paraste de besar 
Una manera que te da la temperatura normal 
Aquí tu saca lo de única lo difícil pa' buscar 

He besado a mil mujeres y no hay, hay 
He tenido mil placeres y no hay, hay 

He recorrido todo el mundo 
Buscando un beso profundo 
De esos besos intensos 
Pero no hay, hay 

Ha pasado mucho tiempo 
Desde aquel magnifico beso 
Pero recuerdo cada segundo, milésima de segundos
Que me hacen recordarte a ti (uh oh)

Porque ya no me dejas verte
(¿Por que ya no? ¿Por que ya no? ¿Por que ya no?)
Me dicen yale a la si se ha ido
Y tu que me echas al olvido
Y yo no dejo de extrañarte

Yo se que es normal que tu te confíes
Pero no te desvíes que la mente te sigue
Son invisible las historias que tu vives
No soy un santo pero somos compatibles
Yo toco con los ojos y miro con las manos
Quieres que sea bueno si me conociste malo
Entidad no tapo, evalúe el trato
Una di de capo, placeres a cada rato

Dime mi amor que va hacer conmigo
Si tu distancia es una adiós
Olvidarme sera tu castigo
Y recuerda como te hacia el amor

A tu casa fui a buscarte, pero no pude encontrarte
Porque ya no me dejas verte
(¿Por que ya no? ¿Por que ya no? ¿Por que ya no?)
Me dicen yale a la si se ha ido
Y tu que me echas al olvido
Y yo no dejo de extrañarte

Si tu también me extrañas, porque te engañas
Si yo se que piensas en mi cuando te bañas
Oleme la cizaña que un día empañas
Tus amiguitos y amiguitas no se irán cuando
Vamos pa la cabaña, a beber champaña
Y ve la foto y solamente le daña
Cuando ven que te acompaña
Se activa la piraña, me montan la campaña
De odio y musaraña

Se que por el amor se sufre
Y que con el sexo me envuelvo
Yo que tenía a muchas pero al final siempre me dejo
Y tantas princesas bonitas en la calle
Que casi yo no me contengo
Y yo te conozco, aunque soy insaciable
Que siempre quiero mas de lo que tengo

A tu casa fui a buscarte, pero no pude encontrarte
Porque ya no me dejas verte
(¿Por que ya no? ¿Por que ya no? ¿Por que ya no?)
Me dicen yale a la si se ha ido
Y tu que me echas al olvido
Y yo no dejo de extrañarte

Mi vecinita le gusta los jangueitos
Cada rato que la veo anda con su cervecita
Ya no le gusta quedarse en su casita tranquilita
Porque es media liberal la chamaquita
Su coleccion de Cds es desde playero
Pero en su carro siempre anda con lo nuevo
Y si le pones reggaeton, se pone fresca
Y hasta abajo, a lo under, ella le da sin miedo
(Le da sin miedo)

La nena no se compara
Lleva una vida de suerte
Mírala como ella baila
Mientras ella canta, se mueve

Eh ah, eh ah
Eh ah, eh ah
Eh ah, eh ah
Eh ah, eh ah

Se le ve
Que se le salen por los poros
Cuando escucha pista y coro
Y las bocinas retumbando a la vez
Ella se pasa en los foros
Bajando reggaeton al I-Pod, se graba
En su cuarto, bailando frente al espejo
Y lo tira por Internet, que fresca es
Bailando Love And Sex (sex)
Mueve su cuerpo de vedette  (sex)
A simple vista se le ve que es
Adicta, adicta, adicta, adicta, adicta (sex, sex)

Del party, de marque en el parque quemando

Las mano arribas, las que son
Las que son, las que son

Me gusta estar a tu lado 
Hablarte y decirte todo lo que siento 

Me miras y entiendo lo que dices 
Me tocas y haces que mi piel erice 
Me habla y tus palabras en mi viven 
Me pruebo y tu cuerpo se derrite 
Te miro y tu alma se desviste 
Te toco y curo tus cicatrices 
Te hablo y hago que te hipnotices

Si la gente supiera que hasta con mirarme tú me tocas 
Nadie sabe, imaginan los sabores de tu boca 
Cada abrazo, cada beso que mi mente alborota 
La fragancia que despide tu presencia en mi ropa 
Desenfoca mi orgullo por el piso desemboca 
Cuando a solas olvidamos en la cama se encojota 
Las ganas cuando nos vemos hasta la luna, eso se nota 
La distancia entre nosotros y el deseo nos acopla 

Llegas y te vas otra noche 
Fugaz donde solo quedo tu perfume 
He vuelto a probar el sabor de quedarme 
Con ganas como de costumbre 
Ayer te bese hasta las sombras 
Cuando estás conmigo allí es que tu descubres 
Donde no han podido llegar 
Yo si te hago volar yo jamás te detuve 

No quiero que te vayas

Plan9,"Madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-round
With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing, the calliope crashed to the ground
Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot, snappin' his fingers, clappin' his hands
And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand
And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand
And some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers, daddy's within earshot, save the buckshot, turn up the band

And she was blinded by the light
Oh cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
She got down but she never got tight, but she'll make it alright

Some brimstone baritone anti-cyclone rolling stone preacher from the East
He says, dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that's where they expect it least
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner all alone, watchin' the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance

Yeah, he was blinded by the light
Oh, cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
He got down but he never got tight, but he's gonna make it tonight

Some silicone sister with her manager's mister told me I got what it takes
She said, I'll turn you on, sonny, to something strong if you play that song with the funky break
And Go-Cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe to go outside
And little Early-Pearly came by in her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride
Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer, playin' backyard bombardier
Yes, and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent some dude with a calling card, he said, do what you like, but don't do it here
Well, I jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground and asked him which was the way back home
He said, take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night, and then, boy, you're on your own
And now in Zanzibar, a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car, hummin' a lunar tune
Yes, and the avatar said, blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar, we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon
And some kidnapped handicap was complainin' that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night
Well, I unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears I saw a gap but figured he'd be all right

He was just blinded by the light
Cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night

Mama always told me not to look into the sights of the sun
Oh, but Mama, that's where the fun is

",Police Story
Planes Mistaken for Stars,"[Originally by Black Flag]

I was so wasted
I was a hippie
I was a burnout
I was a dropout
I was out of my head

I was a surfer
I had a skateboard
I was so heavy man,
I lived on the strand

I was so wasted
I was so fucked up
I was so messed up
I was so screwed up
I was out of my head

I was so jacked up
I was so drunk up
I was so knocked out,
I was out of my head

I was so wasted I was wasted.



",Wasted
Planet,"Forty thousand headmen couldn't make me change my mind
If I had to take the choice between the deaf man and the blind
I know just where my feet should go and that's enough for me
I turned around and knocked them down and walked across the sea

Hadn't traveled very far when suddenly I saw
Three small ships a-sailing all towards a distant shore
So lighting up a cigarette I followed in pursuit
And found a secret cave where they obviously stashed their loot

Filling up my pockets, even stuffed it up my nose
I must have weighed a hundred tons between my head and toes
I ventured forth before the dawn had time to change its mind
And soaring high above the clouds I found a golden shrine

Laying down my treasure before the iron gate
Quickly rang the bell hoping I hadn't come too late
But someone came along and told me not to waste my time
And when I asked him who he was he said, Just look behind

So I turned around and forty thousand headmen bit the dirt
Firing twenty shotguns each and man, it really hurt
But luckily for me they had to stop and then reload
And by the time they'd done that I was heading down the road

  Yo y'all niggaz get'cha rhymes up
  I'm sick of this shit, get your bars up niggaz
  Sixteen bars of death my niggaz
  Ay Planet, let's go, c'mon!

[Planet Asia]
All it takes is sixteen bars of death
Rain hail snow, I make the clouds drip to get you wet
And that's a bar no matter East to West
Don't get this rap shit twisted, I'ma star that'll meet your threats
And we can bet, cause if I go deep in death
Then it's a rap, face it, you could never beat the best man
And even as a little kid - niggaz knew I had it in me
cause the way I used to spit at the assemblies
And unless you remember me from now on
Everytime I spit then it's a special delivery
My world is of ability, women give neck willingly
Niggaz respect me lyrically - my, city is feelin me
From the inner to the optic jewels
From the beginnin to the endin I am not to lose
I'm not the fool, spit 'til no bars is left
And all y'all teams can feel my sixteen bars of death

[Chorus: Planet Asia]
Sixteen bars of death
Rap monster on cassette, never runnin out of breath
Yes, sixteen bars of death
And when I spit I spit bars 'til it ain't none left
  [repeat 4X]
  Get your bars up (yeah) get your bars up (yeah)

[Planet Asia]
In the apartment, the artist get it started for hours
Heartless, like the department of the water and power
Yeah - fuck your hot showers, and while you watchin the fight
I cut your cable just to show who really got power
Now I'm, minutes from ass-kickin sessions
Asswipe, we tax niggaz like Pacific Gas & Electric
Bar spitter, {?} cigar splitter, tar getters
Hard-hitter hater niggaz want to war with us
But get your bars up, cause niggaz know about me
and they know about my squad, so as far as us
I ain't got to answer the shit, so if you see me in the club
keep your mouth closed and dance with a bitch
Cause I'm bout to be the hood philanthrophist; get down or lay down
And how I got up in the spot wasn't an accident
Just love blood tears and sweat, and large respect
And sixteen bars of death, yeah

Yeah, this to all the people in my life
that's restin in peace, why'knowhatI'msayin?
Here to let y'all know that y'all give me inspiration to do what I do
And I ain't never gon' forget you, knahmsayin?
For as long as I'm alive

[verse One]
For all my peoples gone... from nine to five
As long as I'm alive my niggaz we gon', be strong
Now peep the song, the streets is gone, to each his own
From money spent to every song that I was featured on
It's for the block and we gon' keep it goin
For all my close friends gone, givin me energy to speak my poems
Rest in peace to the God Al Woods
Kept my self-esteem high since a child in the hood
I was raised on the Westside, wildin for goods
Same cats that used to kick it now be killin each other
Comin from different neighborhoods and not feelin each other
The way they used to loud talkin, last words is nigga I'll shoot you
The streets is eighty-five, cause nowadays you might get
popped in the back at the party tryin to flee to survive
For all my friends that travelled to the other side
You'll be forever on my mind as long as I'm alive

[Chorus]
(As long as I'm alive) Tell all my homies that I'm
lost in the storm, I'ma keep it movin on
(As long as I'm alive) You'll always have a piece of my heart
Piece of my mind, and a peace of my art
(As long as I'm alive) You shall forever be mourned
I'm thinkin bout y'all every mornin
(As long as I'm alive) I shall never forget
the good times and all the places we went

[Verse Two]
In high school you was my closest homey, although from different crews
We used to chop it up bout all the shit that we was into
From girls to guns, and situations in our circle
And it hurts everytime when I think about the day they merked you
You left a lonely spot
Broke down when I heard it like damn why they have to leave the homey shot?
My fond memories are commonly remembered
Good times and in my mind it's like I speak to you spiritually
And to my favorite Uncle Franklin Harper
You shall never be forgotten for as long as I'm alive and talkin
Inside a soul darkened, due to circumstances
These past years done had some friends of mine who died from cancer
It's messed up never knowin your chances
And Tammy I wish you was here so you could see how much we been advancin
And your management is much missed, but I know you watchin
Rest in peace, little Ann George and Les Watson
And I'll gladly sing this song with pride
Cause all y'all forever in my heart as long as I'm alive, you hear me?
I'll gladly sing this song with pride
Cause all y'all forever in my heart as long as I'm alive

[Chorus]

[samples from the movie ""Juice""]

[Planet Asia speaking over samples]
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Your memory'll live on, with me you can trust
Dust to dust and ashes to ashes
You're on my mind more for sure as time passes

[Verse Three]
Sometimes I find myself stressin, then realize at least I'm livin
So as long as I'm alive, it's for y'all I'm reppin
Until I'm back to the essence, and if it wasn't
for half of my peoples gone I probably wouldn't practice my profession
From all the gunfights, and white chalk, funerals wakes and white cops
Lockin my niggaz soon as the night pops off
Nowadays gotta be strong to survive
But I be representin my peoples as long as I'm alive

Now it's just sixteen beers in Jamaica
I'm the hip-hop Barry White with Hustler tales
Cause my voice makes honies want to touch theyselves
Just give it to me girl, shake your booty ma
Make a nigga want to turn you to a movie star
Jacuzzi in the car, I'm bout to lose it y'all
Who woulda thought your baby boy'd be a superstar?
And in the hood, all my peoples know I spit it hard
Two-thousand-and-what?  y'all cowards bout to get a bar
And mines is gritty, spent a lot of time in the city
Mindin, my business, grindin, I'm high-saditty find me
Now that's a military assignment
And if anybody told you I ain't the hottest then they lyin!

Right, right?  (TRUE!)  Word bond man, really tho'
I never mess with silly hoes, just chicks with brains
""At your local college dorms,"" we sneak past the R.A.'s
Hit your dame, fast in a flash, quick to game
But Young As' got bars to tie
I'm tryin to get enough cash to buy the cars that fly
Airplanes with the bars inside
Thirty-thousand feet high squad deep spittin bars instead
PS2, Xbox, see my crew
Make suckers want to be that cool
Lookin at us like we got food but kick rocks once the heaters move
But back to the song - miras move, c'mon

[Chorus]

[verse Three]
Damn girl!  Shake it then you go back it up
When God made you he gave the whole package
But don't trip - I was born to work it with no practice
No houses, no couches, no mattress
(Jayson you nasty!) That's what they tell me, but umm
Somehow they always end up at the telly, and umm
Somehow their good lookin friends start trailin
And inhale what's in the other room that they're smellin
Or trailin just because of what their homegirl was tellin
So, it's only right I keep it tight and take care of 'em
And, you can have 'em for the rest of your life
But I'm just tryin to have the rest of the night
Don't need no stress in my life
Don't need a person askin questions to fight
Speak not a word ma unless it's polite, 'fore I invest in a flight
Cause all I need is affection tonight
But when it's over it's the exit aight?  Now let's ride

It's like the great {?} to who made the Egyptian scriptures
I'm spiritual cultivation the way my words entered your dome
No stoppin once the mission is known
You know the topic many prophets can't physically show 'em

And many different pedigrees sent from out the heavens to the chosen
So the struggle is maintain some integrity
And until it's over, I shall remain a soldier
Like Aztecs with aspects that they govern, it's on

want to live, you gotta eat from the tree
And reach the degree, the medicine for my peoples is history lost
And in religion, the mystery cost
Unofficially off brothers who be frosted mentally

Black man recognize the science of life
It's all you, right and exact, it's actual fact
It's all you, everything in existence
The sun the moon the stars the galaxy and every dimension

Fuck a pagan religion, let's look at the state of our livin
And I say it again for all my peoples layin in prison
Cause what's the cure if it don't change the condition?
If it's holy it's pure, undiluted in any form with no mixtures

Many claim a parable and scroll the scriptures
But what's the story if you never catch the whole adventure
And we want the facts right now
Or else we bout to turn America, upside down

Poisonous nights, street life, police lights
A whole nation of men women and kids that don't eat right
It's freedom or death, kingmanship or slaves to success
And why the fuck I owe the government net?

They're puttin holes in my check
While undercovers put the holes in our chest from
Every corner to block they got us posin for death some
Get out of this, but most don't even know what the knowledge is

Children payin tuition to these brainwashed colleges
Still in the same position they had us and still got us in
Look at where all the problems begin
Where the problem begins, is when you motherfuckers try to pretend

And try to act like you ain't really bout the dollars and cents
A scholar was sent, to shed some proper knowledge and gems
More than Pradas and Timbs, papi came to father his kin
I came to add another part to the trend

And add the sword to the devil's lapel
Cause me and him could never have resemblance
Simply cause his level is Hell, never I fail
Never will and never shall, forever real

'Til my words, from now on, 'til I'm dirt
Forever with my five fingers put together puttin in work
I'm your black star power, the now or never shout of let's get free
Your scientist, the future of tomorrow has come

And we want some answers right now
Or else we bout to turn America, upside down

Till I catch you till I touch you once again

We'd hear the sirens sound

And we took it very well
When then black rains fell
When the dust came down around us
We were safe and sound

It was baby needs shoes
The PTA and barbeques
And it was two-handed touch
Out on the white house lawn

And we were nobody's fools
Fillin' in the swimming pools
We poured concrete and steel
When the neighbors had gone

Now we all live here together
Yes we all live here as one
Now we all share the comforts of a hole in the ground
And we all remember livin' in the sun

Here in the shelter
We heard nuclear freeze
We heard first-strike strategies
We heard how to pay the taxman

When the big one falls
We heard good guys and bad guys
We heard little lies and big lies
About who comes out the winners

And it's not that bad at all
When a madman gets a gun
He's gonna point it at someone
If it's up in texas tower

Or over there across the pond
And if you step on his pride
Or if he hurts somewhere inside
He might let one fly

When his nerves are gone
Now we all live here together
Yes we all live here as one
Now we all share the comforts of a hole in the ground

And we all remember livin' in the sun
Here in the shelter",A Letter From the Shelter
Planet P Project,"Can a man be really sure of his spot
Can he hold on to the little that he thinks he's got
Can he look around him and trust what he sees
Can a woman be sure she'll still have a hime
When the whole world leaves here all alone
Will she wake up with the flood around her knees
Is there one star falling?
One star falling
I see a man in a little back room
The shades are drawn and in the gloom
I see him on the floor with his head in his hands
Now he rises up with a vacant stare
As the camera fades and leaves him there
But still the image remains of a broken man
Needing one star falling
One star falling
So close your eyes and rest your head
Turn off the tv and go to bed
Will it still be there when you wake up
Cause danger rides on the wind tonight
Reason flickers like candlelight
So look up to the sky and wish for luck
Wish for one star falling
Is there one star falling?

No more suffering, no more hate and sorrow.
Just love, sweet love.

And we close our eyes
Because he is filthy and homeless
So we don't even look twice
Under his arms there's a Bible
And a look of peace in his eyes
This man also loves Jesus
So just open up your eyes
Love your brother
Any form, shape, and size
Because no one looks perfect except in Jesus' eyes
Take time to know your brothers
And open up their eyes
A boy sleeps under a bridge
Mad from the world's lies he sees you
Preaching to a crowd
And comes to seek Jesus Christ
And when you tell him about the Lord
You'll see the fear in his eyes...
Jesus' tugging at his heart
The Lord opened up his eyes...
We go through this life with our eyes closed
And we turn off the people who need us most
We gotta take time to know one another

He and I took a stroll down by the by the sea side
A seeking good fortune and what might be tide
'Twas just as the day was a dawning
After resting we both took a tramp
We met Sergeant Harper and Corporal Cramp
Besides the wee drummer who beat up for camp
With his rowdy dow dow in the morning

Says he me young fellows if you will enlist
A guinea you quickly have in your fist
Likewise the crown for to kick the dust
And drink the king's health in the morning
From a soldier he leads a very fine life
He always is blessed with a charming young wife
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife
And always lives happy and charming

Ah now me bold sergeant we are not for sale
We'll make no such bargain, your bribe won't avail
We're not tried of our country we don't care to sail
Although that your offer is charming
And if we were such fools as to take the advance
This right bloody slander would be our poor chance
For the Queen wouldn't scruple to send us to France
Where we would be shot with out warning

He says me young fellows if I hear but one word
I instantly now will out with my sword
And into your body as strength will afford
So now my gay devils take warning
But Arthur and I we took in the odds
We gave them no chance for to launch out their swords
Our whacking shillelaghs came over their heads
And paid them right smart in the morning

As for the wee drummer we rifled his pouch
And we made a foot- ball of his rowdy dow dow
And into the ocean to rock and to roll
And bade it a tedious returning
As for the old rapier that hung by his side
We flung it as far as we could in tide
To devil I pitch you sez Arthur McBride
To temper your steel in the morning",Arthur Mcbride

But where is my love gone
With his cheeks like roses
And his good black Billycock on
Decked around with primroses.

May burn and scorch his beauty

I would do my duty.

To view the meadows and flowers gay

I did salute her most courageously
When she turned around well the tears fell from her

A diamond ring I owned I gave you
A diamond ring to wear on your right hand
But the vows you made, love, you went and broke them
And married the lassie that had the land""

""If I'd married the lassie that had the land, my love
It's that I'll rue till the day I die
When misfortune falls sure no man can shun it
I was blindfolded I'll ne'er deny""

The thoughts of my true love run in my mind
When I turned around to embrace my darling
Instead of gold sure it's brass I find

And I wish the Queen would call home her army
From the West Indies, Amerikay and Spain
And every man to his wedded woman
In hopes that you and I will meet again.

Did you have to be so good?
The way that you hold me whenever you hold me

No sé ni como aguantar
Ni controlar mis deseos de morderte

Mientras busco distracción en el radio

why me entretengo con tus ojos cristalinos
Como gotas de champán
Why sin embargo no dejó de pensar
En lo suave de tus labios cuando sueles besar
Why el sabor de tu saliva cuando empiezas a amar
Why entiende lo que digo esto es fácil
Solo sigue el manual
No tiene tanto problema
Es cuestión de escuchar
No busques una tangente
Es fácil como decir
Que yo te gusto como tú a mí

On a horse of white, unless we're riding side by side
Don't want to depend on no one else
I'd rather rescue myself

Someday I'm gonna find someone who wants my soul, heart, and mind
Who's not afraid to show that he loves me
Somebody who will understand I'm happy just the way I am
Don't need nobody taking care of me

I will be there for him just as strong as he will be there for me
When I give myself then it has to got to be, an equal thing

I don't wanna be like Cinderella sitting
In a dark old dusty cellar waiting
For somebody to come and set me free
I don't wanna be like snow white waiting
For a handsome prince to come and save me
Oh I will survive until somebody's on my side
Don't wanna be no no no no one else I'd rather rescue myself

I don't want to be like Cinderella

For a handsome prince to come and save me
On a horse of white, unless we're riding side by side
Don't want to depend on no one else
I'd rather rescue myself

I can slay, my own dragons
I can dream, my own dreams
My knight in shining armour is me
So I'm gonna set me free

I don't want to be like Cinderella
Sittin' in a dark old dusty cellar
Waiting for somebody, to come and set me free
I don't want to be like Snow White waiting
For a handsome prince to come and save me
On a horse of white, unless we're riding side by side

Jack Frost snipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Will help to make the season bright
Tiny little tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said, many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Seductively he's torn apart

Reluctantly he plays a part

An incident it causes an altered state

Habit forming that leads to habit breaking
The tenant's lost in his new undertaking
His mind's confused he cannot tell who is wrong
An image appears but never stays with him for long

Call me a player cause I crush a lot 
And I make that money, cause I make it hot
And we use to kick it, shoulda never stop

Cause I'm still after ya, 
And I'm still a bachelor
Are you still alone alone alone alone alone

So how you doin' how you been and how you livin'
You know baby girl your boys place still pimpin'
Plus I heard you got a man with a game plan
With a wedding plan
But you know I'm not the man, I had a different plan
For me and you to follow, a runway model
With a self made baller
But you was caught up with your lil' man a simple life  
You didn't want no fast life, poppin' bottles err night
So I get the movin' just like a g should
Three years later and your boy still livin' good
I cant fuck baby girl, yea I'm missing times
Creepin' on the low, you could swear we was doin' crimes
It was all good, we use to freak
And fuck late night in the back seat
Same number you can call me when you get that urge
Still got 25 cars, money to splurge

It's been a minute since we last had a talk
Still hypnotized by the hips and the walk
I'm tryin to figure out who you with, hopefully alone
If thats the case you still got the number to my phone
It might seem like I'm tryin' to holla for some ass
But with the green that I got, I can get that fast
It was something that we had, and I still want it
So if you tryin' to give it to me, let me know I'm on it
I'm still after ya, I'm still a bachelor
If you got a man, understand that I'm not mad at ya
I might have fell off track, but I'm tryin' to bring it back
To the way it was, and if your feeling love

I'm still here, right here, if u wanna ride
We can take it back how we did it up in '95 
With no strings attached,
I'll put u on your back 
Do those freaky things, make u always wanna come back
Writin' checks without a man, you cant say that your mine
Cause I'm still a free agent
Not tryin' to resign
I'm not a ball player
But I'm a  baller, player
And if your still alone
I'll be callin' later

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

This little girl didn't care what anybody said

Get out there and don't stop, stop the music

They didn't dig his vision, they tried to fit him in
But there's no room for losers until they make you change
And then you love them, tell me how much longer?

Get out there and don't stop, stop the music

Baby, come on, baby, come on

You've got a perfect mind, you've got a perfect smile
You're unlike anybody, got your own shine, come on
If you just keep on dancing, then you won't feel no pain
Baby, it's your decision, only you can break the chain

Music's like love floating in the air
You can reach out grab it everywhere
Just for your love, you can put it on
You were put here on earth to make goodness for people
Better make it worth living while the world's still spinning, come on

Just another busta bustin' hustla cause my game is true
Do or die, down wid you, jumpin out Fly wi-zay fool
Work is bought and time is short, that won't keep this playa cool
Must I come up wid it from decision sittin' on the bluff
Workin' out to rock the house, many youngsters get it buck
Rollin' wid the rough and tough, risin' wid the early sun
All about my hog, standin tall, when my job is done
Then you know that I'm the one, only one, for the one,
One who gives me power over cowards till thy kingdom come
Fly will be second to none, toastin' every chauvinist
Male or female makes me bail when I choose to dis
My time that rock market pacin' poppin' on Fly paperchase
Not illegal ain't sequel the playa moves on me makin' pay
Sayin' what I want to man, cause I'm backed up by a crew

Tell me how to do my job, boy that ain't your job to do

Don't attack my dollars you will holla as this playa gleam
Stealin' robbin' killin' mobbin' never is a job ah mine
But if Funkytown take me under, I'm bonin' you all the time
Insist to commit a crime, Allah is not likin' you
When you play wid the child of God, my God gon' play wid you
Still wid plenty work to do, speak or hold a brother's peace
Playa choose to represent with intent to make mil increase
Opposition is deceased, Fly response for some and pay
Ain't got time for cuttin' games that you suckas choose to play
Your plan I will infiltrate, I'm strapped wid the piece of manner
Like other down brothas Flizy got sense and that ain't my kind
Playa is the subject of the public with nothing to prove
Don't you try to tell me Flizy know what Playa gotta do, gotta do

As years past, I thought I knew what birthdays meant
But never knew until I recalled all the time that I spent
People think they thankin' bankin' but they only maintain

With me and frost tossin' crowns to the ones that deserve
Full of herb, so superb, and Fly ain waitin' no mo'

I ain't lyin' cause I got a back and boy that's tuff
I mean they ruffer than the soldiers in the persian gulf
And when we buck you out of luck
Cause it's time to drop
Once we commense it gets intense until the time that we stop

And all this love for the Fly I'm trappin' deep inside
To motivate and pick me up
When I'm choosin' to glide
As I go from coast to coast again proposin' a toast
But this one here is to my baby that be lovin' me most
So watch me roll across the globe until ya eyes get tired
And I might slow it down when my child retires
I know it's real but it's just a lil mess that I made
Super trill so I'm movin' on perfectin' a trade
And Flizy raised any which a way I'm choosin' to flow
Droppin' bows to the floe'  with they face in the snow
So don't oppose or uphold any grudges with me

to victor each battle, until I reach my casket.

(CHOURUS)

Verse 2:

I went from little boy crawlin straight to big boy ballin,
and coach another hustla as seem this was my callin,
you lookin full of pitty, and hurtin like this city,
no jackball is stallin, Fly get to the nity-grity,
while you just sit and wonder, Fly take this nation under,
with Mafia Many Mi-zade, with much time to punder,
with skills of a hunter, and flawless like nazerin,
not flogg-o like tardo, cause Flizy just ain't havin it,
we need some reconstruction, foundations full of lovin
from fathers and granmas to aunties and cousins,
and still lil IBN thuggin and drugin ain't gonna help this,
my private invitation, to take my mind from conflict,
I'm fruitful like sunkist, dismiss you like a schoolhouse,
no treason is needed, before we take you izout,
this here without a di-zout, I pity the situation,
condition is critical, you headed for damnation.

(CHOURUS)

My life was kinda heckted, nobody would respect me,
Flys pockets had an echo, lil vadaz always check me,
my kinfolks movin getty, and boomin out the chevy,
the young is where we hi-zung, they felt Fly wasn't ready,
but hagnin down in sodas, so quick my mind grew older,
I started pushin products, stayed higher than the rollers,
with much love for dojah, witch took all my profits
from ass in to ass out, yo ass off I knocked it,
 I dodged all the floggers, and stayed bout my dollars,
this mobbin ain't starvin but damn sure want to holler,
Fly bizness I'm gonna handle, and wear you like sandle,
and buck like alexander, and light you like a candle,
I spread my p like wildflower, and try to tear yo soul up,
like 16 century holdup, before Fly make you fold up,
Fly got me pimpin sold up, but bustaz don't accept it,
you need to drop my pri-zops, you locol jokaz critics.

(CHORUS)

Too many double faces, in unexpected places,
who ran they mouth to mi-zuch, prepare for body braces,
with no one here to save ya, except the one who made ya,
you wit then don't test us, I say  you rather prey bra,
you must know no betta, you playa hate so cleva,
you lemons reach my level not ni-zow not neva,
I wrote lil Fly a letter, and read it to his fizace,
and let that Many Mizade, you local vocal nutcase,
complete this integration, and max irratication,
of those who try to block me, from Fli-zy destinaion,
a modern day plantation, is where them crackers trapped us,
them bustaz took our culture, them bloody Dego bastards,
but Flizy in rebelous, with rightoeusness to tell ya,
you take this lit and run wit it, or sit and be a failier,
and Fly refuse to answer, to iligetiment bastards,
them G.O.D and Flizy, gonna bring natural disaster.",Situation

Ups and downs and turn-arounds surround me on this mortal ground
Pump it like a shotgun, holes in the back will quickly take you down
I break up out submission holds, with the bearings I control
The entire 70 minutes that you feelin from your stereo, HERE WE GO

Cool and calm we cannot be, 
Buckin like a zulu tribe cause from inside like a LUV
off the hook like Fly streak be, R.I.P. big D.O.G 
Fly gone do it to 'em like ya told me make 'em feel me
Keep the kindness all up in me, keep the realest rollin' wit me
Tricklets are the realest in ya sight so don't you try to trick me 
Stick me with the family first, real so real so real it hurts
This game will get to much and start to lovin how this mafia works
With dirt fall from off the hurt
that's when I-be	-N choose to give this up
And Flizy giz-on diz-ie tryin [gon die tryin]
to piz-you'll miz-i ends on up
Strut my stuff and get it up in such ways you thought you wouldn't see
See me cause I am the real and know you gone be feelin me.

Twenty-fo' for them hoes, fangs hope they bite

Cuando una noche de amor que yo no dudo 
La eternidad venga seguro 
Tú y yo, el destino y el corazón, seremos uno 

Yo soy la tierra de tus raíces: el talismán de tu piel lo dice 
Yo soy la tierra de tus raíces: lo dice el corazón y el fuego de tu piel 
Yo soy la tierra de tus raíces: el talismán de tu piel lo dice 
Yo soy la tierra de tus raíces: a ver que dices tú 

El talismán de tu piel me chiva 
Que ando descalza de esquina a esquina 
Por cada calle que hay en tus sueños 
Que soy el mar de todos tus puertos 
El talismán de tu piel me cuenta 
Que tu destino caerá a mi puerta 

Cuando una noche de amor desesperados 

Yo soy la tierra de tus raíces

Voy desesperado
El corazón prendido
Allí en el calendario
Buscándote y buscando
Como un mercenario
Tú dime donde estás
Que yo no te he encontrado

Las manecillas giran
Yo voy al contrario
Bebiéndome la vida
A sorbos y a tragos
Me viste así de frente
Que tremendo impacto
Para unirme a tu mirada
Dime si hay que ser

Torero
Poner el alma en el ruedo
No importa lo que se venga
Pa' que sepas que te quiero
Como un buen torero
Me juego la vida por tí
Te dicen que ya me vieron
Solitario en un callejón
Que ya no duermo y desvarío

Que el humor ya me cambió
Y tú por dónde estás
Que mi presión ya no me da
Te buscaré, vuelve conmigo
Porque tu no sabes
Que yo te necesito
Como el perro al amo
Que si tu no respondes

Aquí todo es caos
Me viste así de frente
Que tremendo impacto
Para unir me a tu mirada
Dime si hay que ser

So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

He did not mean to lie, I look outside it's raining
Anyway, I guess I can live with a rainy day

They are falling through but that couldn't happen to me and you

It's crazy to do it again, but how could I possibly lose?
How could I lose? This time I'm in it for you

If you get caught in one make sure you notice where your heart is at
Don't take chances with things, things like that""

It's crazy to do it again, but how could I possibly lose?

To turn back the time
What I gotta do, baby
To take away the tears you cry
I don't wanna let you precious heart
Sleep through my hand
Don't let my love passed away
Like footprints in the sand, 
Footprints in the sand.

Sun goes down on another heartache
Feels like a million miles between us
Gotta find a way to your forgiveness
Don't wanna walk alone no more
Like a stranger on the shore

Trying to keep up the smile that hides a tear

Playing for Change,"I pray to God that men are lost in your footsteps

And that pain will not haunt you or cause you despair, 
I pray to God

Omnipresent, pure consciousness
Manifesting in love and divine bliss,
Supreme creator beyond space and time, 
Supreme soul guiding mankind,
Supreme inner energy that manifests as all powerful mother nature along
With the unchanging and constant father
I submit and submerge myself, I become one with

A hug from his arms to live in Peace ending wars
And  poverty
Find joy from sadness 
And that light illuminates the lost souls

Plaza Jazz Trio,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Please stay right by my side
Two can be one
The righteous way to go
Been a while but no
I'll believe if I'm told so
You're second to none

The question is what do I know about love
They ask me all the time do I know about love
Naturally I say yes but I don't know shit
'cause if I did I wouldn't be in and out of relationships
Why? Do I get caught up in eye candy
A few days I pound she ain't nowhere to be found
Everyday I pull so many dimes
I need to change my middle name to one line
'cause I got so many one liners
I try to tell her I was ready to go all the way
But she couldn't be patient with me
And now look at the end result
She ain't here to get these roses I brought
But I'ma keep my self-esteem up
And keep looking for some real love
You know its true what they say
Love's as precious as a rose
Will I ever find a rose I don't know

It's been a miracle from what you've done

You want me to put you over my whole career
My career was here first and its here to stay
Don't trip girl you're still a prior life and
Movie sets, rhyming, singing, and world tours
If I ain't got a rose in my life then what's it all for
You think I wanna be in private jets
Laid up in five star hotels by myself
Nope I want a rose to share with
The blessing of a backbone but I can't stay alone
I come home to a home cooked meal
A manicure pedicure without seeing a bill
Am I describing you I don't know
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life living single
Patience is a virtue that's the way that it goes
The question is will I find my rose is that you

My moms taught me not to wear emotions on my sleeves
So when I leave please believe I'ma leave man
I'm not a charity case
But you might have to donate some love tips and show me the way
'cause if I really knew it all
You think y'all would have to talk to me about how to love and all
Naw I'd be on top of the world
At twenty seven with a wife, pregnant, and white picket fences and shit
It's cool I'ma get there soon
Running around in the yard having fun with my little ones
Thinking to myself I had my share
There's gonna be women everywhere
Not like the one I got here
Independent, fine as hell and got her own career
And if I ever needed her
She'll be right there

I feel like I got something

Pleasure Club,"I am a shotgun rider,
For the San Jacinto line,
The desert is my brother,
My skin is cracked and dry
I was ridin' on a folk coach
And everything was fine,
'Till we took a shorter road
To save some time
The bandits only fired once,
They shot me in the chest
They may have wounded me but,
They'll never get the best
Of better men
'Cause I'll ride again

I am a river gambler,
I make a livin' dealin' cards
My clothes are smooth and honest,
My heart is cold and hard
I was shufflin' for some delta boys,
On a boat for New Orleans,
I was the greatest shark they'd ever seen
But the captain bumped a sandbar,
And an ace fell from my sleeve
They threw me overboard,
As I swore I didn't cheat
But I could swim
And I'll ride again

We are heroes of the homeland, American remains
We live in many faces and answer many names
We will not be forgotten, we won't be left behind
Our memories live on in mortal minds
And poets pens
We'll ride again

I am a mid-west farmer,
I make a livin' off the land,
I ride a John Deere tractor,
I'm a liberated man
But the rain it hasn't fallen,
Since the middle of July,
And if it don't come soon my crops will die
The bank man says he likes me,
But there's nothin' he can do
He tells me that he's comin',
But the clouds are comin' too
He ain't my friend
And I'll ride again

I am an American Indian,
My tribe is Cherokee
My forefathers loved this land
They left it here for me
But the white man came with boats,
And trains and dirty factories,
An' poisoned my existence with his deeds
Nature is our mother,
We are suckling at her breast
And he who tries to beat her down,
Will lose her to the rest
They'll never win
I'll ride again

Le vieux monsieur tressaillit. Il appela une infirmière et lui demanda d'appeler les renseignements
et de demander les coordonnés de Sergeï Kalninitch. Par chance, Sergeï, agent spécial du KGB,
vivait à Moscou depuis la fin de l'affaire. L'homme laissa un message sur la boîte vocale.
Deux jours plus tard, Sergeï rentrait chez lui. Il entendit le message.""j'aimerais vous rencontrer
au sujet de l'affaire des biscuits magiques, aux vertus bénéfiques du Docteur?""
Il ne prononça pas le nom, Sergeï partit sans attendre pour l'hôpital Strogoff.
Il passa deux longues heures avec Sacha, ancien détenu du Docteur Volodim Tank.
Sacha raconta l'horreur, comment il était devenu handicapé depuis quarante cinq ans,
comment il s'était échappé, à demi-paralysé dans les glaces de Sibérie, ses années cachées
en Ukraine. La mafia medicine cake, les loups du Docteur Tank. Sergeï prenait des notes.

Font que t'oses plus mettre sur pause

Allez goinfre-toi, vas-y mange, sur le dos des autres
Et fais des exploits toujours dans la faute
Mais sache qu'un jour de choc bien pâle on paye tout
Le lâche rembourse ses dettes jusqu'au dernier sou
Pense à deux fois avant de sauter

Je rassemble des sourires à montrer aux gens
Pour paraitre bien aimable
Parce qu'au fond je boite, la tête dans une boite
Ca me crève les yeux, empétré, trop anxieux
Alors je lèche mes larmes, rien ne sèche le drame
Quand les autres m'alignent
Quand les autres s'acharnent
De long en large, ma vie en marge
Faudrait que je calque mes pas sur mes voisins de palier
Avec ma vision do monde décalé
Maus why'a rien pour classer ma passion, mon metier.
Je rentre pas dans les cases
Je rentrerais jamais dans votre cage.
Et alors ?
See'est ma vie see'est mon puzzle
Je suis souvent soumis à des tonnes d'a priori
Je me répands des fois de trop moi
Vouloir montrer que j' aboie
Plus fort que toi, mais j'ai les paumes qui tremblent
Et l'inconnu je l'appréhende
Cherchant souvent mes yeux d'enfants
De vieux tourments
Sement le doute font que parfois je mense
Et que même je triche alors sur mes mains je crache
Je mords mes lèvres
J'en bave ma sève
Je pleure mon venin
De ne savoir rien
Coupé par mille larmes je me sens laid
Mais see'est comme ça qu'on m'a fait
Je ne suis pas quelqu'un de sage
J'entrerais jamais dans leur cage
Il n'en tient qu'à moi seul
Lancez moi des pierres à mille contre un seul
Ma vanité me sert, elle me protège de vos sales gueules
Pense comme tu le sens, moi je ne sens plus rien
Je vous tourne le dos, je suis déjà loin
J'entrerais jamais dans cette cage.

But behind closed doors she a nasty girl, behind closed doors she a nasty girl.

Nails stay manicured, pretty little feet
Shoes so sexy, body so hot
Hair lookin' like she just came from the shop
Legs so smooth, clothes so tight
Style so sexy, make her just right
Never too much, never too little
Black laced bra, Vicki secrets in the middle
Eyes so innocent, smile so bright
Works in the mornin, but she'll party all night
All for a man, all 'cause she bought it
All 'cause she crazy in love and don't doubt it
Product of her birth place, know about the streets
Clean in the work place, dirty in the sheets 
Keeps her own toaster, makes her own bread
Lady in the streets, but a freak in the bed

Had to sneak her outta choir for her to put it on me

One thing about her she get her own money
Gave it to her yesterday while she was doin' laundry
Favorite toy of mine is my lil bunny
Bow legged and glasses, such a real woman
Sex all night, go to work every mornin'
Text me from work and told me she was horny
Text her back and told her me too mommy
When you get off work daddy gon' punish
You're my nasty girl forever I promise

She plays like my house is her emergency room
Tells me to undress and to lay on the sofa
Checks all my vitals like a docs supposed ta
All white coat, all white heels
And nothin' underneath so its an all night deal
I'm a number one patient and delighted to be
And when she needs her medicine I give her Vitamin D
But wait, I got a lawyer girl that's so wild
And every single night she wanna take me to trial
She said she needs some evidence and to show her the proof
So I put her on the stand and I give her the truth
Cause I'm hung like a jury

You may proceed, let the games begin
And if I call a miss trial we gotta do it again

crackers bannin' niggas e'eryday my nigga

My dog went to court today they gave him fifteen
Cracker banned my lil' nigga he was se'enteen
Young nigga don't even know what all that time mean
Pussy ass crackers done shattered my nigga dreams
They holl'in' mandatory they want him to do the whole thang
Nigga showed up in court on my dog and did his thang
Nigga did my nigga now I got to bust his brain
Nigga woulda did me my dog'd do the same
His lady callin' me cryin' and now I feel her pain
Tired of losin' all my niggas to the chain gang
In thirty minutes a nigga whole life can change
Cracker over sinister niggas when this shit gon' change?

[Chorus:]
Pussy ass cracker give a nigga a hundred years
Have ya mama leavin' out the courtroom in tears
Crackers don't love to have a nigga breathin' for real
Take a nigga life from him they don't know how it feel
Pussy ass cracker give a nigga a hundred years
Have ya mama leavin' out the courtroom in tears
Crackers don't love to have a nigga breathin' for real
Take a nigga life from him they don't know how it feel

Ain't talked to my dog yet but I know he sick
Next fifteen years of his life behind a fence
Cracker find a nigga guilty and hit him wit' the bench
Gave one of my dogs twenty-seven on his first offense
The time they givin' the nigga for the crime ain't makin' sense
They jacked the number up now it's eighty-five percent
They did that to make you fuck niggas out there snitch
And put conspiracy in the game to railroad the click
And crackers feel like niggas ain't got no common sense
A nigga paper ain't right they banned off the rip
A public defender don't get you shit but a long trip
And judge sentencin innocent niggas without a guilt

[Chorus]

How in the fuck can fo' birds get you a life sentence?
But give a cracker seven years for money launderin' millions
Shoot a nigga in the leg they sentence you like you killed 'em
Cracker catch you wit' that iron and throw you under the buildin'
You a nigga that mean you guilty 'til proven innocent
Money talk and bullshit walk a thousand miles
You ain't got a paid lawyer then don't go to trial
Crackers owe each other favors, they'll swap ya out
""You give us him, we'll give you him"" know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Nigga took thirty years on a cop out
Fuck you get thirty years for breakin' in a bitch house?
Crackers playin' a dirty game boy this shit wild

[Chorus]",100 Years
Plies,"[Chorus:]
Damn my P.O. I ain't gon' stop grindin'
Violate me if ya want gon' have to come find me
Lookin' for me in the streets I'm somewhere shinin'
Live every goddamn day like it's Friday
Damn my P.O. I ain't gon' stop grindin'
Violate me if ya want gon' have to come find me
Lookin' for me in the streets I'm somewhere shinin'
Live every goddamn day like it's Friday

Tell the feds if they comin' they better come now
They got my chips straight now I'm ready to retire
I ball 'til I fall homie thug 'til I die
And if I died today I know I'll probably fry
But if I hit the right lick I can live nice
Think I'm scared to go get it you goddamn lie
My money go to lookin' funny I'm gettin' on seventy-five
Non-stop homie straight to the Cuban's island
I like to get money, fuck hoes, and rock ice
Give a damn who don't like it, it's my life
That's why I drank e'eryday dog and stay high
Catch me in the strip club lettin' money fly
And goin' broke the only thing that can make me cry
I told my P.O. she can't change me don't even try
The street life got me gone I don't know why
Tryna at least see a couple mill' 'fore I die

[Chorus]

Before I went to sleep I prayed for a hundred squares
Told God he'll bless me if He really cared
Know you fuck niggas prayin' for me to get killed
Know you crackers wish you could give me a hundred years
That's why I ball and stunt for the niggas in jail
Cracker gon' have to kill me 'fore they put me in a cell
Nigga told me to turn myself in I told him ""go to Hell""
Cause if they want me they better do they job and that's real
Worst thang they can do is hold me with no bail
Until that shit happen been done ran across a whole mill'
I thug it out 'til the end homie that's how it is
Life too motherfuckin' short for me to sit still
I can't leave these streets nigga they pay my bills
I gotta be dead in prison nigga for me to chill
I asked a trick the other day why he pop pills
He told me I'll pop 'em too if I knew how it feel

[Chorus]

I wake up e'ery mornin' lookin' for a money bag
When a nigga died and he was broke then he died sad
If I was on my dick you niggas'll be glad
Squeeze eights on the donk just to make you mad
Long as my heart still beatin' nigga I'mma get cash
Live every motherfuckin' day like it's my last
Indictment money in my pocket and 'Gnac in my system
Need every muthafuckin' day like Christmas
Heared the crackers downtown givin' out big numbers
I know some muthafuckin' haitians givin' out triple.

Club that I'm goin' in tonight homie... You better gon' head and get'cha
Shine on before I get to the club dog...

[Chorus:]
Let me thank tonight wat I'm a do at the club?
Might show up tonight, just to throw dubs
Or I might buy the bar to fuck with' the scrubs
How I feel tonight shawty I am the club

Neck full of jewels whole pocket full of money
All the goons around me so you know I'm comin'
Half a brick in my pocket ten stacks on me
Better let me ball you don't want no problem homie
Last problem in the club somebody start dumpin'
I'm the main attraction y'all peons
Got a dope boy knot on me, no one's
Came through the side do', slid with' my gun
Somebody daughter gettin it the question which one
'Gnaced up and on good 'dro, body numb
Let me show you how a real goon have fun

[Chorus]

Y'all in trouble tonight we got the club locked
We ain't dancin' over here all we do is bop
One thang fa sho we got them hammers cocked
Look at all the dimes sweat us, they comin' by the flock
Look at the lil' hater over there, got him hot
Seen him lookin' at me so I held up a knot
I don't know if you know homie I run the spot
And don't 'cha play with' me, you ain't got enough shots
Order mine straight up, drank it on the rocks
Been in the club five minutes and done closed shop
How can one nigga be this gotdamn hot?
I don't know if it's me it might be the watch

[Chorus]

Slid through the club late all I need is a hour
Like they told me lil' homie money is power
Ran the streets all day I'm fresh out the shower
Watch how a goon rock let me show you my volume
Check my track record homie all I beat is stallions
I done smashed already shit you can have her
If you want her better catch her better gon' snatch her
Want straight animals over here, no hackers
Better put the cuffs on her 'fore the goons pack her
When we leave the club watch you follow after
Y'all ain't groupies baby stop bein' embarrassed
This one here in the book, this a closed chapter

Plies,"Bra if yo cash ain't right, right now dawg shit just fucked up right now dawg you done took
A lost when a bitch don't wanna give you nothing dawg telling you dawg you can make something happen

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
My money looking funny nigga just making it barely shit ain't how it use to be nigga ain't
Fronting the package gotta choke me a bitch outta something I gotta have it I'm on my
Dick dawg gotta make something happen

When a nigga money fucked up it's hard for him to think straight
Seem like a nigga life in park when he ain't got cake
First thing that cross a bitch mind shit he gotta take
You can stay broke forever or you can make a shape
Cause when you broke bitch talk to you any kinda way
You on ya dick bitch don't wanna here shit you gotta say
If you ain't built for this street shit den get out the way
Cause when a nigga broke everybody's fucking gravy
You either get money out here or you fucking hate
You think a nigga gone give you something den keep waiting
You betta suck up yo muthafucking pride and chase it
Cause when a nigga broke he ain't pose to have patients

[Chorus]

I don't know if God trying to punish me or my luck just bad
I don't know which one of 'em it is but I need some fucking cash
I rather be in prison broke then out here without a stash
They say when it rains it pours then how will it last
Before I let it rain on me I'm a let a bitch crash
With all black on chie five and ski mask
The streets judge off what you got not what you had
I took a lost and it hurt me fucked me up bad
It ain't no feeling in the world like loosing ya last
I ain't got no choice I'm fucked up gotta bounce back
Seems like it take forever to get to get it but you can loose it fast
I rather a muthafucka visit me while sitting behind a glass

[Chorus]

The nigga that invented robbing I bet he was broke
Cause when you fucked up out her it ain't no fucking joke
And all bets off when a nigga money low
A nigga willing to take chances he ain't neva took before
And willing to cross a muthafucka for the love of the dough
I can't fault nigga cause I done did that shit before
If you gone take it just be ready to play it how it go
It's every nigga for self this shit cut throat
I bet I past me a nigga for he past me tho
For every nigga balling it's a hundred niggas hunting
I don't know if he told but these yung niggas thuggin
So why you outta balling it's some niggas riding lucky

[Chorus]",On My Dick

And you can go fuck another nigga if that's how you feel
If that's gone make you feel better then gone and do it hell
You asked me bout the lil panties shit and I kept it real
Know that shit probably hard for you to swallow still
And I ain't know how bad I hurt you til I seen yo tears
And I ain't askin you to accept how a nigga live
You feel another nigga could treat better then that's what it is

Cause I know me I'm a fuck up again anyway
But in my muthafuckin heart nigga want you to stay
Cause once you fuck up the shit could never be straight
I'm dead ass wrong that's why ain't got shit to say
I know you think a nigga ain't give a fuck anyway

And how that pussy was bitin shit ain't wanna escape
You rode that dick so long until you started to shake
And I can tell when you was nuttin I see it in yo face
I'm a miss fuckin ya from the back and how I grab ya waist
And most of all I'm a miss how that pussy taste

You don't wanna fuck with me no mo then cool, it's fine
Before you go baby can we fuck one mo time

It ain't another nigga who gone fuck ya like I do
You talk that shit all you want but bay you know it's true
I fucked up, I said I'm sorry, now it's on you
You play stupid and give me away if you want to
You say fuck it, it's over then I guess we threw
I know if I caught you cheatin I probably cut you loose
Don't get it fucked up ain't tryna tell you what to do
Whatever decision you make I got to live with it
Whatever yo answer is jus make sure you can deal with it
But if we do break up I'm a keep tryna get it
The shit we goin through right now is real silly
Cuss me out and let's fuck bay and gone kill it

I know you caught me cheatin and you tired me lyin
I'm a be honest witcha baby I know I crossed the line
You don't wanna fuck with me no mo then cool, it's fine

",Money Straight
Plies,"Ey, I'd like to welcome all you motherfuckers man
To the home of the goons,where the grave yards over crowded
And where chopperz is a must

You caught slippin' crackers goin' find your ass, not breathing
100 wholes in your ass with your body leaking
Nigga ridin' with 'em drums, nigga for a reason
'Cause down here we in the middle of murking season

Stay on your porch nigga if you ain't ready to make a shake
'Cause this the home of the bodies, check the murder rate
Money and ski's is the only, that'll be the murder case
So you better kill him if you don't want him at your court date

If you comin' you better come with 'em choppers and don't fake
'Cause if you bullshit, you're the one that's getting erased
This niggaz murikin' out pussy niggaz in broad day
Where-ever you get caught slippin' at that's where you lay

And like they say nigga no face, no case
As long as these goons are lurkin' these streets ain't safe
The more rounds you shoot nigga the less aim it takes
It's murkin' season so you pussies better stay out the way

Murkin' season don't end, this shit year round
It ain't never drop, murkin' season never slow down
It's impossible to many choppers floating around
These young niggaz they sick with it on that 4 pound

Lil cuzin' 12 and all he talking is murkin' now
Old lady said she got woke up by that chopper sound
Say she got on her bed and laid back down
From what I heard 'em crackers fired 120 rounds

4 motha fuckin' dead bodies laying on the ground
Niggaz bettin' on it now, who goin' get off first?
Running your fuck box better, what how you choose your words

That nigga sending threats pussy, you got a lot of nerves
Niggaz would leave your motherfuckin' brains on the burb
This ain't the 80's dawg, niggaz getting murked
Everywhere you turn you see dead niggaz ono t-shirts
Everytime I pass by the grave yard I see a herse

Not respecting these streets is what got you niggaz fucked
That oussy nigga ain't about it, he just know how to bring tongue
Runnin' your dick, suckin' lips would get you chopped up

I know plenty niggaz like you that done got touched
You talking loud 'cause you got a chopper nigga that ain't enough
I know 100 niggaz that got choppers but only few would bust
You got the mouth of a killa but you ain't got the guts

You got the front game down packed but you ain't got the nuts
You probably got off before but you ain't wack nothing
This the wrong place to play games dawg, the streets real
Trying to impress a mothafucker would get you nigga killed
Murking season is official, now this shit for real
",Murkin Season
Plies,"Aye, I like to welcome all you motherfuckers
To The Real Testament
This where the truth get told
And bullshit ain't tolerated

Before I sell my soul I?ll lose everything
You can lock me up, cracker, I?ma get out and do the same thing
You take this rap shit from me, I?ll find another game
Don't get this shit confused, nigga, this was never my dream

I only [Incomprehensible] without a scene
I?d rather kill myself before I?ll live a lie
Before I ever turn informer, nigga, I?d rather fry
My momma lost me to the streets, I told her don't cry

Told her if she understood real she should understand why
The wrong slip in these streets and crackers had your life
Been had plenty of money, nigga, but never paid tithe
Nigga was caught up in this thuggin', I apologize

You call the nigga your dawg but will he really ride?
This nigga know how to get money but will he testify?
Give a fuck why you told, snitchin' somethin' I can't buy
Rather I sell a hundred thousand or I sell a mil'

The fact remain the same, nigga, I'm still real
Broke my heart, they gave my lil' homie 15 years
I put a cast on my heart in place of the tears
He told me, ?Plies, I'm livin' through you while I been here?

The realest shit I ever heard, that shit gave me chills
And I?ma get that time off him if it?s God?s will
I don't know when God comin?, that's my only fear
Been drankin? since I was sixteen, it help me think clear

Don't come to my funeral if I ain't fuck with you while I was here
Some fuck niggas in the county now who tryin? to get me in there
But niggas in hell want ice water so I don't care
The opposite of you, fuck niggas, ?cause you a square

I know of some fuck niggas that hate me that I ain't never met
Never talked to me, never even seen me yet
Only thing they know is I'm where they tryin? to get
Respect it or check it, nigga, ?cause I don't know this shit

I been dealin? with envy, nigga, ever since I was a git
Hated by many, loved by the same so I'm even, bitch
Now I put my hand on the Bible, swear to tell the truth
You liked to hear lies
This is the wrong CD to listen to, nigga, nigga
",The Real Testament Intro
Plies,"Hey, Mama, know I ain't never tell you this before
But it really hurt me knowin' I'm runnin' you crazy
I wanna talk to you real quick

My momma told me while I run these streets she can't sleep
Her phone ring late at night, she think some'n happened to me
Her nerves so bad right now she can't even watch TV
She turn her head every time she see a police

She scared to look 'cause it might be me in the back seat
Whenever she hear about a shootin' her heart skip a beat
She heard the Feds was in the town, her knees got weak
She know I'm at the house, the only time she at peace

Her blood pressure through the roof all because of me
Her favorite words is 'Dope ain't the only way to eat'
She told me other day she hope I don't die in these streets
I just pray to God she don't wipe her hands with me

I'm a goon to the streets but to my momma I'm still her baby
Raised a street nigga by yourself, you a hell of a lady
Shit I'm doin' now got nothin' to do with how you raised me
Shit killin' me to know I'm runnin my momma crazy

Goon to the streets but to my momma I'm still her baby
Raised a street nigga by yourself, you a hell of a lady
Shit I'm doin' now got nothin' to do with how you raised me
Shit killin? me to know I'm runnin my momma crazy

Remember the nights me sittin' up in a cold cell
I'm wakin' you up out of your sleep, it's me callin' you from jail
You ain't say it but I know inside you mad as hell
You called off from work just to bond me out of jail

I get in trouble, I call you, seem like it never fail
Can hear you now, ""Boy, you need to sit your ass down somewhere""
I come and eat, I take a shower then I'm outta there
I know I'm stressin' you at times, seem like I don't care

You wrote bad checks for me to have somethin' to wear
You risked your freedom for me, nowadays that's real rare
Every time I think about the shit, I wanna shed a tear
That's why I buy you some'n for Father's Day every year

I'm a goon to the streets but to my momma I'm still her baby
Raised a street nigga by yourself, you a hell of a lady
Shit I'm doin' now got nothin' to do with how you raised me
Shit killin? me to know I'm runnin my momma crazy

Goon to the streets but to my momma I'm still her baby
Raised a street nigga by yourself, you a hell of a lady
Shit I'm doin' now got nothin' to do with how you raised me
Shit killin? me to know I'm runnin my momma crazy

You did the best you could with me and I love you for that
Wanted me to stay in school but that ain't where my heart was at
I got exposed to the streets and fell in love with stacks
And all the times I hurt you wish I could take it back

When Daddy left us you stepped up and took up his slack
I know I'm selfish and feelin' there's some'n I know I lack
This shit I'm doin' now I know you raised me better than that
You taught me how to be a man and showed me how to act

Sometime I wonder how you still proud I'm your son
After all the stuff I took you through and all the shit I done
Well, like you told me when God want me, how I can't run
Before He take me, want you to know how much I love you, Mom

I'm a goon to the streets but to my momma I'm still her baby
Raised a street nigga by yourself, you a hell of a lady
Shit I'm doin' now got nothin' to do with how you raised me
Shit killin? me to know I'm runnin my momma crazy

Goon to the streets but to my momma I'm still her baby
Raised a street nigga by yourself, you a hell of a lady
Shit I'm doin' now got nothin' to do with how you raised me
Shit killin? me to know I'm runnin my momma crazy

I think I'm speakin' for every street nigga 'round the world
I don't think we sit down long enough sometime
Just to realize what we takin' our momma through
It hurt me to know, dawg, that I'm runnin my momma crazy
And it really killin' me to know that I'm help killin' my momma

I went to see my nigga, he doing 17 1 of the realist niggas I dun ever seen
Got caught with a bird his record was clean coming back from Dade all he needed was to speed
He was a real soldier but his partner was greed, went out with that 40 how is 17 yrs worth
A key shit cause 20 grand will get you 10 a piece he ain't want to hurt nobody
He was just tryin' to eat he had a real job went to work 4 days a week said
Dis was his last trip and he was getting out the streets he a good nigga a second is
All he need.

[Chorus: x2]
Sum niggas made mistakes fucked up circumstances now they life gone probably goin' die in
Da pin.they dun gave up life they put it God's hands what happened to a miracle all he
Ne is a 2nd chance.

[Verse 2:]
Wish I had 2 chance 2 sentence the judge kids and watch em beg for they life like me
Niggas did give them a life sentence for something that wasn't big.
Before they get granted they appeal they gotta do 10 you gotta be on the other foot for
You to understand the scariest thing in the world is to be a black man I wish
Wat my future hold I wish I knew in advanced I approach life every day just hoping
I win a lot of us already lost they sitting in the pen dis shit crazy cause God forgives sins.
But wen it comes to the system that shit don't bend I guess it do depending on the
Color of yo skin.

[Verse 3:]
I though it was understood that nobody was perfect how can 1 mistake make yo
Life worthless God made us all we here to serve a purpose yo life in 12 strangers
Hands and cum back with a verdict but is that fair what if they all was dirty you mess up
1 time and they cum back with 30 what if you ain't got money yo hold family hurting
Den you ain't got a choice you gotta cop out early but if you were rich you wouldn't had that
30 but what if the judge racist ain't nobody around to overrun it the system fucked up
It ain't sturdy welcome to America home to the controversy

That super friendly shit, ain't about
I don't him, keep him from round me
Tryin' to peep something?
What you tryin' see?
Never get that close to find out where I be
I don't know that nigga
Get him from 'round me

[Chorus: x2]

Niggas come around, guess what? I stop talkin'
Holla at you niggas later, grab my shit and start walkin'
Fuck that shit, I done seen too much
It seem niggas scope niggas and gettin' niggas touched
Get in friends wit niggas, turn 'round and set 'em up
Even my own dog, talk to 'em bout certain stuff
My own friends come around, nigga I hush
Outside of court rooms, nigga I done seen enough
Time to get money, I'm so loyal
4 deep doin' business, that's a no-no
Cause what a nigga thinkin', you will never know
But do my own time nigga, if I have to go

[Chorus: x2]

Ion fuck wit no nigga, who got a lot of friends
Cause you never know, who that nigga want to win
You vibe wit too many niggas, you spread yourself then
And them the type of niggas, know everybody business then
Nigga too friendly, no telling who he wit
You niggas fuck wit any nigga, you can't do it big
Guaranteed you will never slide up under kid
I keep my eyes open, and my fire hid
That's how I stay away, from all the fuck shit
I gotta couple homeboys, but I don't run wit clique
The least a nigga know, the less he can snitch
I run solo, so I don't have to kill a bitch

Plies,"You know some people used say money change things.
I'm here to tell you money don't change every motherfucking thing.

[Chorus]
Last ten years momma been working twice a day.
Grandma on a kidney machine, she done lost all the weight.
My auntie go AIDS, she starting to lose her faith.
My brother back in prison, second time he gone away.
My daddy still smoking that shit I can see it in his face.
My lil' cousin 16 pregnant from a nigga 38.
Tryin' stay on my son, make sure he's doing what his mama say.
Before you take me god, help me get my family straight.

I asked god why he didn't bless me with a silver spoon.
Cause if he did, I would never have had to be a goon.
If he gone change my family, I hope he change em soon.
I'm tired of answering my phone, hearing bad news.
My grandma on a walker, she can barely move.
Just to tell me she love me, take all her breath to do.
She on a kidney machine I know it's hurting too.
4 times a week gotta get her blood drew.
She say the bible and a prayer is the only thing that get her through.
Why my grandma deserve this, god what did she do?
Though just cause I had a lil' money I could buy her a new one.
She hold the family together she's one I can't lose

[Chorus]

My auntie got AIDS and I'm watching her suffer.
Why she gotta die cause she was in love with a hustla.
Even though she's dying, she say's she still loves him.
I know if I see him again, I'll kill that mothaf**ka.
Only get 15 minutes to talk to my brother, cause he in prison gotta go see him if I wanna hug him.
Some niggas willing to lose their freedom just for thuggin.
Cause he made a mistake I gotta be here because I love him.
My uncle just called me, found out his daughter f**king, f**king when they 14 like it's nothing.
In the hood it's happening 10 out of a dozen, that nigga her daddy age that's f**king my lil' cousin

[Chorus]

My daddy damn near 50, still living with his momma.
Cant even have a family reunion, cause it's always drama.
Last three months I done lost both of my uncles.
Why my family luck so bad, I sit and wounder.
We ain't close like we should and it's taking us under.
The only time we come together, is to have a funeral.
Sit around and talk about each other, spread rumors
I know its some of my fault, cause I don't talk to em.
For my family to be happy is all I wanted.
Help my grandma fight, god I know she don't.
To see my mama retire that's all I want.
Hope my brother get out to see his kids for once.",Family Straight

He was your homeboy he your co-defendant now,
If you gonna get money get it then lose the crowd,
Niggas in prison cause they homeboys done ran they mouth.

[Chorus: x2]

To that young nigga who took 'em on a high speed chase,
Ain't condoning what ya did I'm just glad you gotta way,

You tried to play cool but ya should of seen your face,
Jitt a motherfucker lost them in broad day,
Doing a hundred dog going down a one way,
Jumped out on 'em turned into a foot race,
Jitt know the streets so they couldn't keep they pace,

You aren't gotta do it but for you I'ma celebrate,
Do me a favor dog stay out them crackas faces.

Plies,"Man I hope yall can excuse me for a lil' minute man
Just sitting here thinking bout my little partner
Who just got killed man its wild tho
How the motherfuckers you love the most
Seem like them the ones who always die first homie
Dog I just wish I had the opportunity
To just bring my nigga back for just 1 day homie

[Chorus: x2]
Wish I can bring my nigga back for 1 day
And Take him by the daycare to see his son play
And go to show him how his baby momma done went stray
And how them fuck niggas who claiming
They love you done walked away

[Verse 1]
God give me my nigga for 24 hours
So we can ride and laugh at these pussy ass cowards
Get to the liquor park and let's talk for hours
Show him how if the nigga die how they lose they power
Nigga forget about ya dog after they give you them flowers
Ol' trifling ass baby momma done got wilder
Now she fucking the nigga you robbed with the pink impala
Like I told you before dog that ho sour
You can fuck these hoes dog but don't handle them
Bitch you ain't got shit dog money arouse them
After a nigga dead and gone they lose they value
Ho cried at ya funeral and changed right after

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 2]
When you first died a nigga sat around ya momma all day
But since ya funeral them niggas ain't went that fuckin' way
Cause when you die yo dogs suppose to step to the plate
You ain't gotta worry I got her I'll make sure she straight
Make you question if the love was real or was it fake
Out of sight out of mind I guess it's true what they say
When you was here them ones was main niggas in yo face
You ain't gotta deal wit them fuck niggas you in a better place
I almost cried when I seen yo son the other day
You couldn't deny that one boy look like you all the way
I thought love was forever I guess that ain't the case
First you die then they bury ya the niggas walk away

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3]
I'm sitting right here homie eyes full of tears
Never thought that pain last this many years
One thing I've learned from all of this shit life real
Rep yo name till I die homie that's how I feel
Watch how everything changed since you got killed
Two days after you died niggas broke in yo crib
Niggas saying yo lil' cousin the one who sold yo wheels
This shit probably shouldn't fuck with me but it really is
Motherfuckers showed me what Shasta really is
What's gone happen to me after I die one of my biggest fears
See what my partner done been through got me scared to live
I pray to god my life don't end like his

[Chorus: x2]",1 Day
Plies,"[Intro:]

And when we finish them crackers gone have to put you on ice

We gone throw some shit but ain't gone be rice
Hollow points gone be whistlin' comin' back to back

Wanna see what you do when you see that ski mask
Want see you smile for that yoppa when you see it flash
We ain't gone let you get out we shootin' through yo glass
Walkin' to yo car shooting that choppa lookin' mad
Bustin' from the front, the goons bustin' from the back
Clique of young niggas gettin' off in all black

My goons lurk all day lookin' for spots
Tryin' to find where you layin' and what you got

I'm just in one of them moods, I feel like fuckin'
Wanna lay up in somethin' wet, and punish somethin'
I want a nice lil' baby who ain't got on nothin'
I got a taste for some pussy, I feel like fuckin'

Ate pussy in the shower for the first time last week
I got a confession to make to the world, I'm a freak
I think about wet pussy, all in my sleep
My fantasy is to get caught, fuckin' on the beach
The best pussy you can get is when you gotta sneak
I call my lil' baby a shooter, when she nut, she skeet
If I had my choice of how I'ma die, I'd be in some pussy, beatin'
Bammin' pussy, then leave and cause a nigga cheatin'?
My baby sore, cause I done fucked her twice, this evenin'
Said I fuck her so good, it feel like she dreamin'
Got her playin' wit herself for no apparent reason
Need some more of that pussy, cause a nigga feinin'

[Chorus: x2] 

All this liquor keep me horny than a motherfucker
Just text bay and ask her could I come fuck her
Only yak here, but shit, her ass in trouble
Goin' to beat bay, so that mean no rubber
That's my motherfuckin' best, nigga, that's how I cut her
We been fuckin' for a while, that's how we fuck each other
Love diggin' in lil' mama, cause it get gutter
Seem like that pussy go to runnin', soon as you touch her
When I get in that pussy, I'm tryin' to pull a muscle
Ready to come up out these boxers, so I can gon' and fuck her
I can blame it on the liquor, if I wanna suck her
Know I'm ready to fuck bad than a motherfucker

[Chorus: x2] 

Can be four in the mornin' or two in the afternoon
Just thinking 'bout that pussy get me in my mood
Knowin' that pussy on its way, get me in my groove
Nothin' like a bad bitch, who body smooth
Lay her flat on the bed, and look at her in the nude
Then fuck on every inch of the whole room
Money first, then pussy, then food
Around fat pussy, it's hard to keep my cool
Gotta turn my head, so I don't fuckin' drool
I can tell when I want it, feel my boxers move
Yet they pussy get wet, when they want it too
Good pussy the worst thing you can ever lose

I'm sick of this shit dog, I'm tired of being broke, 
I wanna live like the rick folks,
I want the house with the big boat, 
I wanna wake up one mornin' ain't gotta sell dope

I'm tryin' to stay hood but I ain't tryin' to die here, 
I need to be able to spend money with out fear, 
The kinda money I can bawl for the whole year, 
I wanna crib so big I can disappear, 
I want the marble floors with the hangin' chandeliers, 
I need to be able to drink yak instead of beer, 
I don't want a deck behind my house I want a pier, 
I want a walk in closest, a closet full of gear, 
I wanna be able to buy 4 new whips every year, 
And leave the TV runnin' dog while I ain't here, 
I ain't gotta worry bout the bills cause the money there, 
I wanna live like the rich folks up in here

[Chorus: x2]

When a nigga tell you he likes sellin' dope hes a damn lie, 
Cause if he did then he'd sell dope for no price, 
We just willin' to take chances and get by, 
Ain't like we like to do it, we gotta sell by,
Cause if you don't theres a good chance you goin' to die, 
All we need is a lil' money and we alright, 
Cause most niggas just want a piece of the good life, 
The worst feelin' is the shit you can't buy, 
Whats fillet mion when you ain't got the money to try, 
All that miracle shit don't work for my kind, 
One thing about us we like to shine, 
Guess you shouldn't expect shit if you don't wanna grind

Fuck hood rich, I wanna be rich for real, 
I don't want no gun I want a million fuckin' dollar bills, 
Be in mind its brand new and sit it on the edge, 
Walk into my sons room, and you can't tell if its mine or his, 
I want my son to be the first one with a wheel, 
I want to send my son to collage and pay it up for four years, 
Let the streets be mad and tell 'em he ain't real, 
The motherfuckers hate you when good is how you live, 
Cause nine days broke is what the streets call real, 
The same motherfuckers who cant pay there fuckin' bills, 
Take it from me being broke, that ain't trill
It feels even better bein' worth a couple mil

I said a prayer for all the mamas who done lost they child
The 12 year old who wanna fuck God slow her down
Her life all of jammers help her to turn around
Please reach out and help her God before she frown

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 2]
I know that feeling when it feel like nobody care
When you goin' through yo problems seem like nobody there
I started to question myself if God really care
Sometime I cut off all the lights in the room and stare
Wonder if he brought this far to drop me off here
I know it seem like sometimes life ain't fair
They say the only thing you count on in dis world is prayer
I prayed so much that I thought that God couldn't hear
Cause I done been through so much bullshit this past year
Its hard now to find motherfuckers thats sincere
The streets make so hard for you to think clear
I'd give up all dis shit to have my brother here

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3]
I got a call form my home girl her mama died
Somebody home invaded took her mama life
I just held the phone and listen to her cry
She kept repeating herself all she asked is why
Can only imagine what she goin' through on the inside
Cause when my brother went to prison half of me died
Ain't nothin' more precious in the world homie than life
Gotta take the good with the bad homie and stride
The right amount of pressure can make you commit suicide
Imagine the pressure on a nigga who cant provide
When everything goin' wrong its hard to do right
If you goin' through right now all I wanna say is

[Chorus: x2]",Somebody (Loves You)
Plies,"[Intro]
Ay brah, I woke up this morning brah
And I check my stash dog (check my stash dog)
And my cash was lookin' truly beautiful (truly beautiful)
I think I'm goin' out stuntin' today (what)

[Chorus]
Watch dis
Man I can't wait for the summer
I'ma show you how to be a stunner
Watch dis
Pull up in a brand new hummer
Got it like 3 different colors
Watch dis
Stones on my neck and my wrist
Matchin' the paint on my whip
Wha-wha-watch this
Take about 3 to the crib
Betcha don't do it like this
Watch dis
Man I can't wait for the summer
I'ma show you how to be a stunner
Watch dis
Pull up in a brand new hummer
Got it like 3 different colors
Watch dis
Stones on my neck and my wrist
Matchin' the paint on my whip
Wha-wha-watch this, watch this

[Verse 1]
I don't feel right, ain't got enough haters
Somebody send me some, so I can aggravate them
You ain't in my league dog
You ain't got no fuckin' paper
I done fucked her
I'ma let you chase her
Yo money ain't right dog
Better stay your ass home
I'm in my stunt mode
Better cut yours on
I broke a record throwin' money, 20 straight songs
I got my hammer cocked
Pussy I'm in my fuckin' zone (fuckin' zone)
Just let me ask you somthin', how you gonna rob a goon
Try me if you wanna, be a dead nigga comin' soon
Somethin' under my shirt (somethin' under my shirt)
Will change your attitude
I lay my stunt down, give me some fuckin' room

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Well since you brought it up, let's talk about money
That little shit you got, No real came from it
That shit you doin' dawg
We call that shit frontin'
Ol' peon ass nigga, you ain't spent nothin'
You niggas round here talkin'
It's time to show something
You want it but can't afford it
Then you ain't really stuntin'
Check my resume, nigga I'm known for dumpin'
Park my shit in front of the club, And left my shit runnin'
Jack boys send 'em please so I can bun 'em
Touch me if you want, I bet them fuckin' goons comin'
That carbine 15 will leave yo pussy ass jumpin'
Class in session nigga, watch me and learn somethin'

[Chorus]

Watch this, this, this",Watch Dis
Plies,"[Chorus: x2]
I got a name in these streets
Plenty money to blow
Got whips 28's and jewelry to show
And ain't a ho I can't fuck I got hoes to loan
Just don't know if this shit worth goin' fed for

[Verse 1]
As soon as a nigga get knocked the streets call him dumb
When this shit hit the fan everybody run
I don't know a nigga yet who did this shit and won
Money mean nothing to ya if you ain't got a bond
The streets scared now cause everybody getting hung
Lawyers sittin' back sucking all a nigga fund
Said it ain't cool when the rapper got the gun
This shit a game to these crackers and they having fun
The nigga you thought wouldn't tell will be the first one
It'll take number one fuck up and a nigga done
Visitation room that ain't how I wanna see my son
But I don't think about none of this shit when i'm stuntin'

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 2]
I don't know if 25 years worth 2 years of ballin'
That's a big pill to take and I ain't tryna swallow it
Fuck round and get jammed and all this shit falling
Take the streets from a nigga then a nigga starving
Tried to let it go the money kept calling
Streets been good to me got a nigga flossing
Same shit a nigga love be the shit that cost him
Money make niggas hate turn niggas salty
Go to prison now don't take me from my shawty
Bout time I get out he gon' be off in college
Game fucked up now cause all these niggas talking
I'm a street nigga I ain't got too many options

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3]
Nigga always told me to get in this shit and get out
But he ain't tell me bout all the laws and all the drama
You back to square one after a nigga break into your house
It's hard to come up shit when you gotta keep burnin' out
Is cars jewelry and hoes what it's all about
I don't know it lil' daddy I just want a nice amount
Just gave my lil' cousin eleven years for an ounce
You broke and fuckin' with these hoes they gon' ask you to bounce
And niggas buying shit now they can't even pronounce
Done fucked up so much money shit can't even count
Hope I don't wake up one morning wit them crackers in my house
With guns drawn on me and with enditment papers out

Plies,"She my bust it baby [6x]

First time we had sex, it was like a movie
Both of us fell asleep, both of us was woozy
Love how she say my name, love how she do me
Gained feelings for her kinda quick, kinda blew me
Found myself thinking bout her, shit kinda spooked me
More time we spent together more she got attached
I love being around her, seem like the perfect match
She ain't blow my phone up and she ain't never hack
She knew her place, played her role, and she was cool with that
""What you doing"", ""Where you going"" -- questions she don't ask
She took my mind off the streets she helped me relax
She wanted to VIP her face she put me on my back

[Chorus: x2]
Her sex game crazy
Body so amazing
Kiss like she craving
Walk like she taken
Attitude mistaken
Fiend for her daily
Care about her greatly
Why she my bust it baby

What we did last night got me wantin to call her
If I wasn't real homie I'd probably stalk her
From the hood, when she get drunk she talk proper
Got kinky with her, told her dress up like a lawyer
I was the judge last night I gave her all the orders
Worked it real good turned her round and doggystyled her
Told her if I gave her any more might have to charge her
Felt the vibe in the room the feelings getting larger
Took her from the bench and I done turned her to a starter
Tastes like sugar, smell like water
Now she into goons all off what I taught her
What I do to her make her care about me harder

[Chorus: x2]

She my bust it baby [6x]","Bust It Baby, Pt. 1 [*]"

Told you if we goin down we goin down together regardless
We always said we gunna leave this bitch how we started
As long as we got eachotha well fuck errybody
The love we got fo eachother it remain flawless
Ain't no money ain't no hoe in the world can spoil it
The niggas that turned on us priss but they weren't tought it
If poems are real nigga you taught me how to shout it
Bein real is a blessin most niggas ain't got it
And why you fuck niggas mad at us we can't call it
When we die we want you to put us in the same coffin

In da corner with da thugs and convicted fellons.
Lookin for me in the club, I'm in the thug section.

[Verse:]
Wrong section, this ain't where da cris get poured.
This where da pills get popped, dro get rolled.
Where the thugs posted and ducks get soaked.
Better keep ya head up and ya eyes open.
Might not wanna chill over here if ya ain't dumpin.
If we don't fuck with ya pussy nigga then keep floatin.
We gettin loose a lil bit, but everybody focused.
Cause everybody on yack and every body scopin.
Keep a unit in my face and back against the wall.
And hand on fire in case I gotta get off.
Ain't nothin over here for ya but problems dawg.
Surrounded by all hood bitches, no model brawds.

[Chorus: x2]
I don't hang in da v.I.p. so stop checkin.

You a cris popper n nigga ima yact dranker,

Klick full of murkas slash hoe catchers
N at the right time nigga we gon apply pressure
N all the niggas over here certified wettas

(verse 3)
Now if you ain't respected by the streets, then pussy nigga move
'cause this section over here reserved for the goons
And we ain't friendly over here so give us some room
We ain't hard to find nigga just follow the fumes
Any nigga can't hang over here 'cause we got rules
Nigga look like he wanna do something, then do her too
Better keep your feelings to your self and stay cool
You needa handle you're liquor pussy or get blue
Last nigga that played tough, he made the news
Gettin of on the bitch in the club, ain't nothin new
'cause every nigga over here 'bout whateva its on you
'cause hoes only ones that ridin and fightin nigga shoes
Just 'cause it look like we ballin nigga don't get fooled
'cause one of you fuck niggas, can change a nigga whole mood
Nigga can go from ballin to a murkin' attitude
And in the section over here only real niggas approved

Climbing up the ladder with a bladder full of drank
Work in the attic, mathematics fuck the bags
Can’t die with it, all this money I’mma blow
I’mma stack it to the ceiling that Ferrari say hello
Baby mama drama, hundred missed calls
Niggas talking about their drama, I wake up in the morn nigga
Everybody whining, can I live?
Give a fuck about your mom’s how I feel
When you ballin' everybody want a part nigga
But even your shadow gon' leave you when it’s dark nigga
Can’t beat it, I’m what the game needed
Told my nigga boss Don gon take it to trial, beat it
Nothing to lose, tattoos around my gull wound
Gonna point the best out and we gon' run through em
And they gon' get it how it’s coming to em
His own mama won’t recognize him, what is done to him
Back against the wind, just me against the world baby
Body numb, full of drugs, help my nerves baby

So whatever chick I fuck with
She got to be a goonette

I'm her goon yeah
And shes my goonette
I'm her goon yeah
And shes my goonette
Goon

For her birthday I bought her a pink ski mask
When I piss her off she don't let me eat the pussy when she get mad
But real nigga I ain't gon't lie I done fucked her on the rag
It was like she was spottin', she ain't bleed that bad
She don't like to drive the chevy, drank too much gas
Gave her sixty and told her fuck it go buy the jag
She say she know when I'm lyin' to her cause I talk fast
Cut her friends them loose, she said them hoes crap
She like me
She don't fuck with rappers, they lie too bad
Pussy fat, I told her it look like she wearin' a pad
She ain't a ten or a dime, she a ten and a half
A goonette is the baddest bitch you can ever have

Shes my baby, yeah
And I love her to death
Shes got good loving, yeah
And she keeps it on deck
She holds me down, yeah
While I chase these checks
Im her goon, yeah
And shes my goonette
Goon

She play tough and she act hard, but she cry easy
Say if she catch me with another bitch, she gone leave me
You fuck em' good and you take care of em'
They don't want you cheatin'
I first met her she was green dawg, but now she seasoned
She like to drank what I drank, she don't like to drank really
She don't trust no bitches, she feel like they schemin'
She hood as ever, she can talk just like them white folks
I don't know if she can fight for real, but she talk shit though
And everytime she get drunk she like to straighten the hole
First time I fucked her, I acted like the rubber broke
She act like she couldn't take it, she make me fuck her slow
But now she grab my ass, and make me fuck her mo'

Shes my baby, yeah
And I love her to death
Shes got good loving, yeah
And she keeps it on deck
She holds me down, yeah
While I chase these checks
I'm her goon, yeah
And shes my goonette
Goon

I don't want no dingy bitch, give me a goonette
Can put her hair up in a pony tail and still be that
Can be the just woke up, and pussy still wet
And she can be dead ass broke, but she can still dress
And everybody can piss her off, but she wont stress
And just to make sure I'm good nigga she gone check
And every two or three months nigga she get in check
Her biggest fear when it come to me is another bitch
She had her choice, to be gettin' fucked and not necked
If I had my choice, we'd be gettin' fucked and then neck
And now she listen and observe so she talk less
The next bitch to be my lady is a goonette

Shes my baby, yeah
And I love her to death
Shes got good loving, yeah
And she keeps it on deck
She holds me down, yeah
While I chase these checks
I'm her goon, yeah
And shes my goonette

This empty hole inside
Drinks the wine of remorse

And drenched in this desire
Spilling from an empty cup

Hurling smiles and judgments

This vein of tenderness

So full of wonder
Your curly cues
Your contagious smile
And as I watch
You start to grow up
All I can do is hold you tight

Knowing clouds will raise up
Storms will race in
But you will be safe in my arms
Rains will pour down
Waves will crash all around
But you will be safe in my arms

Story books full of fairy tales
Kings and queens and the bluest skies
My heart is torn just in knowing
You'll someday see the truth from lies

Knowing clouds will raise up
Storms will race in
But you will be safe in my arms
Rains will pour down
Waves will crash all around
But you will be safe in my arms

Castles they might crumble
Dreams may not come true
But you are never all alone
Because I will always
Always love you

Storms will race in
But you will be safe in my arms
Rains will pour down
Waves will crash all around
But you will be safe in my arms",In My Arms

I haven't showered and I try to eat
But all your tears, oh, they needed me
I need some time, some time to think
Then I hear you, what you need is

Me, I wouldn't trade your love
For all the candy in this great big world

To make room for all the kisses of tomorrow
And everyday that I get to be here with you is sweet

All need their rest for tomorrow

I will never leave you

Slipping past, you won't see me before you die
Breaking down our sleep, my head's still aching
This war is killing you and all around me

My toys meant most of all
You know how kids are when they're small

Older people play little games in another way
Their castles crumble to sand

You were so darn sure of yourself

You see I've got my ol' guitar, I'm not a beggin' fool

When the fires burn you better pay
Oh Yeah it's gonna get you in the mornin'
Now's your chance you better get away

So many things sittin' on my brain, yes, I need a chance to think
But I've been told not to worry, everything's gonna be all right
Oh, mama, won't you tell me, why did I leave that night?

Seems like it's been ages ago now since I come to town
Ain't much changed, every face is the same
Oh, people just a-hangin' round

I was not aware that you were
Taking me for a ride
Oh, slow down the weather's hazy
Baby you're drivin' me crazy
You know nobody ever gets home a-ridin'
Free
And you'll never find another man
A man like me

Yes I remember when
Ooh I met you
You was only too kind to show me the way
You seemed to me
Like no other
It was innocent love that made me believe
Now down that long long road
We have come yet to begin
Take some, try to get some love and then better
Take some again

Wonderin' if you're really you
And if I'm someone that you could know
Beyond the first hello

Eyes that search like the morning sun but never finding
Silently I can feel the glow and I'm not minding
But then you know I've been tryin' to show
Why it makes me cry, I'm talkin' it over from the inside

Something new and oh, so sacred
Grows within the depths of you
But still I just can't keep from wonderin'
For I'm but a child, too

Changes timelessly fill the spaces
It's so blind of me
I've seen the faces of a gifted few
Who can help us break our chains that bind

Thinkin' all the time, why I can't unwind?
You must feel the pain
Why it makes me cry, I'm talkin' it over from the inside

Something new and oh, so sacred
Grows within the depths of you
But still I just can't keep from wonderin'
For I'm but a child, too

And I'm talkin' it over from the inside

Poco,"Early times gone to rhyme
Somebody said it was a good time
To me, it was a long, long time
Just a long time

Early days gone to a gaze
Somebody said we'll make it crazy
And the leader passed it on
And he got lazy

Songs they got to slippin' and right-hand man took to trippin'
And the leader passed it on
Familiar faces I seen, similar places and I wonder
How we left some traces

Come the moon, go the sun
And I believe there's something on the run
Catching up we ran so far behind

Is that why you won't go and say goodbye

And you really were to blame

And to hide away in shame brother

Always hoping that the day will come
When I can face it, won't have to run
When all there has been is yet to come
When I don't hide my face from the sun
And I know it's myself it's not you

I can see everything
It's all in your smile that brings
All of the special things about you
If you could feel the way
That I do today we could
Find us a better way to get through

Everytime I climb into your eyes
I get so wasted and hypnotized
But there is one thing you can't disguise
That you're slippin' away for a new
Baby if I could control the time
Then I could stop it and redifine

'Cause you know it's no fun

Can you tell me
Is it for certain or does it depend
Upon a feelin' that refuses to bend
Victim of circumstance you'll say to the end
And you pay no mind
You just watch it pass by

Restrain yourself till you can't restrain no more
Can you tell me why is it you sigh
Is it because of a need you deny
So come on up and deliver

My secret thoughts known only by the few
It was a dream much to real
To be leaned against too long
All the time I think she knew

Her words still dance inside my head
Her comb still lies beside my bed
And the sun comes up without her
It just doesn't know she's gone

Now I can't find my way home feeling so blue
I See the sign by the corner light telling
Me which way to go, but I don't know.
When you walked up to me and told
Me dearly.
How you'd like me to join, you said
Quite clearly
Did it ever occur to you, that I might like to
See you?
Everyday I see a different situation,
I can't find much that is true
And you know it ain't much of a relation.
Still, I'm calling on you

All the lime I keep feeling how it could be,
Between lovers who only want to be free
Just the Same I don't feel too strong.
Armed with nothing but a song for too long.
Maybe there will be a day I see direction

Poco,"When I last saw you I couldn't find a reason why
I felt kind o' blue watching you
Hello my sweet friend I've come to sing a lullaby
Can I make amends or should I try

Ooo - Mama can't you see it's not the same
Lookin' back behind A-can't start anew
But then here we go again

Searching back to you I've finally come to realize
When we were as two - tellin' lies
Livin' so afraid we never read between the lines
It's different from today - the sun, it shines

When I first saw you I knew I couldn't change my mind
Twisted point of view - another kind
But love is what we choose and not for us to reason why
Sometimes love we lose and never try

Lookin' back behind is such a silly game
But here we go again",Here We Go Again

In such a special way
And they're just for me and you.

Nighttime comes searhin' blindly
Been needin' some lovin'
I find me followin' my heart
Back to you

Ooh, how it reminds me
That I need no other lover
This feelin' is like no other
And though I can't be with you now

Let this song be another one
That's just for me and you.

So let my heart go on a-singin'
Let my song go on a-bringin'

Not alone
Of which I didn't know then I found
That if I choose to see with my eyes to the ground
Well don't you know
I might as well be tied up and then bound

Makes you feel you're so together - you don't know why

Give me somethin' to believe in - so hang on tight

I could follow you here, I could follow you there
But what good would it do in the meantime?
If I said that I loved you would it really be fair?
If I didn't would it be a crime?

You keep me guessin' all the time
You play the fool and then you shine
Can I meet you in between?

I'm talkin' 'bout you and me, first of all, learnin'

I'm a pretend poet with half a song
Hope you keep your word, wanna see you soon

I wanna feel your body sway

They can talk themselves into shades of blue
Baby I got lots of room
Wanna stay with you night until noon

Get your feet back on the ground,

And pictures changing without the scenes
Broken stories and borrowed lines
Ain't it hard these days
To get on your way
Well, it's still what you do
And it's not so much in what you say

And there are people who ride a train
Into the city and back again
Only to get up in the same old frame
Could you reckon with them blues
In a world that's win or lose
Any fool could see
It goes on just the same

So many people inside the past
Talkin' 'bout these days they're movin' too fast
And the future it will not last
Everybody has a dream
Take the one you can live between
'Cause you're the only one that's left to choose
What you want to win or lose

About the way I feel

I'm a wide open spaced cowboy
I got lazy ways, I got some hidden joy

On some future night, when the talk is low
