Sleeper,"You closed your eyes and left me here
And now I'm jealous of your sleep
I made some noise to wake you up
It seems you've drifted out of reach
I'm not sure if you meant what you said
But that's o k
'cos it still sounded good
When you said it anyway
I'm not sure where you are
When I turn and stroke your face
You don't move anymore
So it must be getting late

I'm not tired even now
I think I'm glad to be awake
I've met these fractured thoughts before
They grin and wander round this place

I'll get up all I find
Is a paper that I hate
Real life disappears
And gets shrink wrapped in it's place
I get up watch tv
Helps me feed my vicious streak
Real life disappears

Then we watch the spooks on the news
Playing chess with the cynics
Hope you die in the arms of your shrinks in your clinics
Now it's gone 5 a m

We smile and plan our revenge
By the end the night has found it's true friends
Up all hours sketching a thousand great schemes
Hope I'm not too tired to colour them in

I get what I want then I'm not sure I want it anymore",Shrinkwrapped
Sleeper,"We should spend the night in a small hotel like this
Drinking champagne in it
We could drive your car through the east end streets to the city
And still make a day of it
Take all I have I've no secrets left to steal
What would you give me for a trip behind your steering wheel

I need high heels just to stand up
Got to carry some stairs to get near enough
I need some wheels to move you around
I've borrowed some tools to chisel you down
Tie me up and I'll confess
A thousand ways that make you statuesque

And it won't last for long better do you worst
While I'll forgive you of anything
Oh your so rehearsed
'Cause some wise guy built you pretty
So you'd get away with it

Take all I have I've no secrets left to steal
What would you give me for a trip behind your steering wheel",Statuesque
Sleeper,"This man lives in the ocean
He puts his favourite clothes on
And drifts away day after day
And you can't hear me call
This man needs a direction
You want my blind affection
And I'm not sorry that I came
I stayed too long that's all

And you're a bad habit
Glad of it
I'm not so sure I can help you
Sad for it
Thanks for it
I'm not so sure I can make you

Stop your crying it's not helping
Stop your crying it's no help
Did you still think that my love
Could make you special

Pulled me in on a high tide
How well you hid your flipside
It won't do to comfort you
Each time you cough or call
You think I wanted to use you
Complex issues just confuse you
You don't care you're unaware
How far these things can fall",Stop Your Crying
Sleeper,"Quickly she came, dressed up for fame,
Riding her perfume downstairs.
Make-up like glue, she danced 'round the room,
To the sound of the corduroy flares.
Let's go to town, taxis all round,
We could stop for a couple of beers.
He looks at it all, stifles a yawn,
She tries not to look like she cares.

What do I do now?
Are we going under?
What did I do wrong?
I thought we had it sorted
Out the other day
Maybe I'm just stupid
Can't we try again?
No-one told me it was raining.

Can't face a club,
They walk to a nearby pub,
Watch a couple of bands.
Draining the glass, they walk home at last,
Reaching for each other's hands.
Nothing is said, he goes to bed
Dreaming of her on his own.
She stays up all week, watching him sleep,
Scared that she'll wake up alone.

What do I do now?
Are we going under?
What did I do wrong?
I thought we had it sorted
Out the other day
Maybe I'm just stupid
Can't we try again?
No-one told me it was raining.

I'll miss you every day of your life
And oh, you'll feel it too,
You're not that strong,
You know I'm onto you.
I'll miss you every day of your life
And maybe when you're dead, I'll get some rest,
From holding onto you.

What do I do now?
Are we going under?
What did I do wrong?
I thought we had it sorted
Is there someone else?
Or am I too familiar?
Was it when I said I wanted to have children?
Tore up all your photos,
Didn't feel too clever,
Spent the whole of Sunday
Sticking you together.
Now I'd like to call you,
But I feel too awkward.
Some things need explaining,
No-one told me it was raining.",What Do I Do Now?
Sleeper,"Because of you
I fall asleep for hours
We're made of glue
Our bodies crushed and tired
I lie and lie
And now a most peculiar
Wave arrives
How it breaks my guard
Waits for me
While we slide apart
I know you're
Taking me nowhere
And now there's
Nothing else to say
I never was a fan
Of the winter
So you'll understand
If I don't stay

We're sick today
Turns out we're only hiding
Got clean away
So nothing clever finds us
We lie and lie
And all this mess we never talk about
Gathers dust and doubt
Somebody take the rubbish out

And on what flavor day
Did you scramble away
Was I lost
Or tired or sleeping
Didn't I look too great
Was it moments too late
When you noticed
Your mistake

Everyday I know you're
Taking me nowhere
And now there's
Nothing else I can say
I never was a fan
Of the winter
So you'll understand
If I don't stay

I never was a fan of the winter time
So you'll forgive me if I don't stay",Because of You
Sleeper,"Everything is quite
Everything is cruel
God you never noticed me
Or anything at all
But I breathe
All of us are broken
All of us are stained
All of us are taken down
Bought and thrown away
Can I breath?
Can I breathe at all
Who are we tonight?
Breathe at all
Ooh you maybe right
Everything is crazy
Everything is still
God you never noticed me
Or anything at all
But I breathe
Can I breathe?
All the days are drawn
On tracing paper drift
Away away they fall
Breathe at all
Ooh you maybe right
Everything is quite
Everything is cruel",Breathe
Sleeper,"Busy drinking gin
In a bar at Biloxi
But I've only had four

And a waitress called roxy
And she's all you want for
All you want for
Cynical me come on come on

Sleeper,"Was it circumstance
Or was it merely
That the sky fell down
And made you weary
I told you but you already knew
I will miss you
I will certainly miss you
You look just the same
In all your pictures
Still somehow you've changed
A fitting or some fixture
I told you but you already knew
I will miss you
I will certainly miss you

Let us pretend that we'll still be friends
You'll stay for a while you all leave in the end

Did a thousand stars come out
To greet us now it's overcast
They shake their heads and leave us and
Maybe I just need somebody who
I will miss you
I will certainly miss you
Now I will miss you
I will probably miss you",Miss You
Sleeper,"Met a man 
A motorway man
Met a man
He really makes me wonder
Slow faced worn and weary
One race left and then
Fall over
And I see him every single day 
And I see him everywhere driving
Past me sunlight
On the bonnet so bright
Everyone is cracking
Slow face on the shoulder
Still straight but everything is lacking
Floating in and fading out
It seems anyway he waves at me 
Through the sunbeams

Met a man
A motorway man
Met a man

He really drags me under
Sixteen miles an hour
Sixteen miles an hour
Baby do you laugh at me
I think you do and you know
That all of us are right behind you
And now I want to go home
But it's too late
How much further to go
Before the home
Straight wave me by and gently sigh
A smile just starts to break
You've got a funny face",Motorway Man
Sleeper,"Pistol shots and lights at dawn
And one fine day you'll find her gone
All the ghosts they come for me
Make her cry a little and cover them up 
Broken clocks and bathroom tides 
But one fine day old mountains rise 
Cupboard doors and garden gates 
And deep inside some glacier waits
And what in the world did I do then?
It's only late for a while 
It's only scent your skin
What in the world do I do to resist?
It's only seventy inches and where do i go?
I know nothing is changing but it's gone
It's really gone
I know it's not really life till its gone wrong
There must be a reason
All the lives that I forgot
And one fine day you'll find her gone
All the nights they run from me
Make her sigh a little and gather them in
And what in the world do I do then?
It's only late for a while 
It's only breath on your skin
And what in the world do I do to be strong?
It's only seventy inches and where do I go?

Anyway I got near it on twice
Maybe I have never been brave
Yes I want to

Please please please
You've got to find a place of your own
Before they carve your name on a stone
You've got to lift yourself up from the ground

And it's a strange world dragging you down

Letting go can't make you feel any worse

All my life I know I was cursed
You can't break it
Please please please

How you feeling today
Isn't it a lovely morning
Seen you looking my way

Sleeping at Last,"When the world welcomes us in
We're closer to Heaven than we'll ever know
They say this place has changed
But strip away all of the technology
And you will see
That we all are hunters
Hunting for something that will make us okay

Here we lay alone
In hospital beds, tracing life in our heads
But all that is left
Is that this was our entrance and now it's our exit
As we find our way home

And all the blood and all the sweat
That we invested to be loved
Follows us into our end
Where we begin to understand

That we are made of love
And all the beauty stemming from it
We are made of love
And every fracture caused by the lack of it

""You were a million years of work""
Said God and His angels, with needle and thread

They kissed your head and said
""You're a good kid and you make us proud
So just give your best and the rest will come and we'll see you soon""

All the blood and all the sweat
That we invested to be loved
Follows us into our end
Where we begin to understand

When the credits have rolled and the tears have dried
The answers that we have been dying to find
Are all pieced together and, somehow
Made perfectly mine

It's a long way down
I lay in my bed and watched you get dressed
I knew it was the end when you couldn't sleep well
My pillow smells just like you
I never slept so well without you
It's a long way down
and I want to know if it was my mattress or was it the way that I touched you
I haven't grown since you left me
I want you to know I don't give a fuck about you

How does it feel to be like you?
I think your mouth should be quiet

For the mountains I've been climbing over and under and over
From the place that I was to the man I've become

No this kingdom isn't quite what it may seem 
You're an illusion, you'll never be king

I met a girl talking away
She found a boy she knew she'd change
I changed my clothes, my hair, my face
To watch us go our separate ways
She said we've grown apart for sometime
But then she found somebody new
I hope Mr. Right puts up with all the bullshit that you do

So he can prescribe me medication
So I can deal with all the memories of being here this way

I met a girl at twenty-three
Knew she meant the world to me
So I gave her everything

Sleeping with Sirens,"Met a girl at seventeen
Thought she meant the world to me
So I gave her everything
She turned out to be a cheat
Said she'd been thinking for a long time
And she found somebody new
I've been thinking that this whole time

Well I never thought you'd stay
That's okay
I hope he takes your filthy heart
And then he throws you away someday
Before you go, there's one thing you oughta know

If you can't hang then, there's the door, baby
If you can't hang then, there's the door, baby
If you can't hang then, there's the door, baby
If you can't hang then, there's the door

I don't wanna take your precious time
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time
I don't wanna take up all your time
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time

You're the lowest type
You're the lowest

I met a girl talking away
She found a boy she knew she'd change
I changed my clothes, my hair, my face
To watch us go our separate ways
She said we've grown apart for sometime
But then she found somebody new
I hope Mr. Right puts up with all the bullshit that you do

Stay the hell away,
While I sit here by myself
And figure out how I got this way
Before you go, there's one thing you oughta know

If you can't hang then, there's the door, baby
If you can't hang then, there's the door, baby
If you can't hang then, there's the door, baby
If you can't hang then, there's the door

I don't wanna take your precious time
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time
I don't wanna take up all your time
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time

I don't want to get things confused
She said she'd never settle for some boy she couldn't use
So now I gotta call the doctor
So he can prescribe me medication
So I can deal with all the memories of being here this way

I met a girl at twenty-three
Knew she meant the world to me
So I gave her everything
And she did the same for me

Imagine that
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty face
No you're such a pretty, pretty face
Well, oh yeah
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty face
No you're such a pretty, pretty face

I don't wanna take your precious time
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time
I don't wanna take up all your time
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time

Sleeping with Sirens,"True friends lie underneath, 
These witty words I don't believe 
I can't believe a damn thing they say, anymore 
Lie, liar you'll pay for your sins 
Now, liar I know all the places you've been

Forgiveness this taste all but poisons my mouth 
I scream but nothing, nothing will come out 
You've gone too far

So tell me how does it feel, 
How does it feel to be like you?
I think your mouth should be quiet 
'Cause it never tells the truth
So tell me, so tell me why, 
Why does it have to be this way? 
Why can't things ever change?

Falling over, and over again 
Oh, why does it have to be this way? 
From the place I was, to the place I am, to the place I want to be 
For the mountains I've been climbing over and under and over
From the place that I was to the man I've become 
I'll be there to see the tower you'll fall from
No this kingdom isn't quite what it may seem 
You're an illusion, you'll never be king

So tell me how does it feel, 
How does it feel to be like you?
I think your mouth should be quiet 
'Cause it never tells the truth
So tell me, so tell me why, 
Why does it have to be this way? 
Why can't things ever change?

Sometimes things are better left unsaid 
But this time you'll get what you give (I can't believe a damn thing they say anymore)

Come down, come down from your tower
Come down, come down from your tower

Sleepthief,"Out on the tar plains, the glides are moving 
All looking for a new place to drive 
You sit beside me, so newly charming 
Sweating dewdrops glisten, freshing your side 

The sun drips down bedding heavy behind 
The front of your dress, all shadowy lined 
And the droning engine throbs in time 
With your beating heart 

Way down the lane away, living for another day 
The aphids swarm up in the drifting haze 
Swim, seagull, in the sky 
Towards that hollow western isle 
My envied lady holds you fast in her gaze 

The sun drips down bedding heavy behind 
The front of your dress, all shadowy lined 
And the droning engine throbs in time 
With your beating heart
With your beating heart

Sing blue silver 
With your beating heart 

And watching lovers part, I feel you smiling 
What glass splinters lie so deep in your mind 
To tear out from your eyes 
With a thought to stiffen brooding lines 
And I'll only watch you leave me further behind 

The sun drips down bedding heavy behind 
The front of your dress, all shadowy lined 
And the droning engine throbs in time

But life goes on
And this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

Sleepwalkers,"There's a story the gypsies know is true
That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.
An old love story that's known to very few,
But if you wear those golden earrings,
Love will come to you.

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul.
So be my gypsy,
Make love your guiding light,
And let that pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight.",Golden Earrings

And I'll watch you fade away

So why don't you just fire me down
So what if you could fire me down

I'd rather be the one you lie about
Than the one you lie to

A blinding light will guide my way
So I can start again

This vicious cycle never ends

I'm gonna tell you a little bit about this 
So that you'll understand what I'm talkin' about

And everybody calls it polk salad, polk salad
Used to know a girl lived down there 
And she'd go out in the evenings and pick her a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper
'Cause thats about all they had to eat, but they did all right

Down in Louisiana, where the alligators grow so mean
There lived a girl, that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame
Polk salad Annie, polk salad Annie
Everybody said it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(A mean vicious woman)

Everyday ?for supper time, she'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of polk salad, and carry it home in a tow sack
Polk salad Annie, the gators got your granny
Everybody says it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(A wretched, spiteful, straight-razor totin' woman

Her daddy was lazy and no count, claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for was stealin' watermelons

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,

Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet

On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

Sleigh Bells,"It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",A/B Machines

I got the kool-aid
I hear the
something from my baby
I wade out to the ocean
Put on my sunset lotion
I see the sun glow

I see the blonde hair
Pick up my feet there
I feel the cool air
The breeze is nice now
I'll tell you right now
I sip my kool-aid
Boy I'm feeling better now
Do I need a vacation?
Just need to get away for a while
Wait, did I forget my sunglasses?

No
Got 'em
I paint my nails pink
There in the sand dome
I hear the oh-so calling on the radio
I see a young boy
He on the upswing
He gets a nose bleed
And I hear the girls sing
I hop on the water slide
Gotta get my swims on
I pull my straps up

Still girls crying in the rain
'Cause you're sitting by the window pane
Tired of the violent grace
Strike fear in their hearts like a devil
And if it comes to this, well then it comes to this
Minnie, you can be a big
You and me could be the dream team
Minnie, you can be a big 

Minnie Minnie, go count your pennies
I'm sorry to say you don't have many
Minnie Minnie, go count your pennies
I'm sorry to say you don't have any

Burn your body, I can see your burning fire

Sit for a while, you can sit beside the fire 
Dreamed I was a hunter with a never ending thirst
By the middle of July you were buried in the dirt
Looking in the dark, saying your goodbyes 
Looking in the dark, saying your goodbyes
We sing everything

I couldn't breathe so I had two of these
Sugarcane bounce the same when it touches the heat, when it touches the heat

Hurricane always came when the season?s complete
I was late, why?d you step back? You were already there
You could take from the lead but you don't even care

I've attempted but become so desperate to win
We only talk about your damn charades
I've attempted but become so desperate to win
We only talk about your damn charades

The grass may be greener but you can't even smell
How did the king included you?
The grass may be greener but you can't even smell
How did the king included you?

Beware, beware
Beware, beware
Beware, beware
Beware?

Knock, knock, getting on your knees tonight
Kicking the boys, you want me back
But the dead was alive when I go to the beach
How could I leave? How could I leave?

Hurricane always came when the season?s complete
Yellow hair over there, now I?ve got to compete 
With a bang on the hand and there's something in the air

I've attempted but become so desperate to win
We only talk about your damn charades
I've attempted but become so desperate to win

Hey young world... the world is yours
Hey young world... the world is yours
Young world young world... the world is yours
Young wo-ah-huh-huh-huh-urld

This rap here... it may cause concern it's
broad and deep... why don't you listen and learn
Love mean happiness... that once was strong
But due to society... even that's turned wrong
Times have changed... and it's cool to look bummy
and be a dumb dummy and disrespect your mummy
Have you forgotten... who put you on this Earth?
Who brought you up right... and who loved you since your birth?
Reward is a brainwashed kid goin wild
Young little girls already have a child
Bad company... hey, now you've been framed
Your parents are hurting... hurting and ashamed
You're ruining yourself... and your mommy can't cope
Hey, little kids don't follow these dopes
Here's a rule for the non cool... your life, don't drool
Don't be a fool like those that don't go to school
Get ahead... and accomplish things
You'll see the wonder and the joy life brings
Don't admire thieves... hey they don't admire you
Their time's limited, hardrocks too
So listen, be strong, scream whoopee-doo
Go for yours, cause dreams come true
And you'll make your mommy proud... so proud of you too
And this is a message... that the Ruler Rick threw
And it's true

""You know, you know what, you know what, you know what?
 We like to party, like to party""
(repeat 3X)

Hey young world, the world is yours
Hey young world

""Yo peep this""

Hey Mr. Bigshot... hey, don't you look fly?
But you don't have a nickle... ohhhh, my my my
You've been fightin again and, you forgot why
Hey kid, walk straight, master your high
Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.... because you make your family cry
And all jokes aside, are you in good health?
Hey little boy... now have you really checked yourself?
You're a disgust, you know someone that I can't trust, you'd
steal mom's welfare... and you'd run and buy some dust, and
plus, a must so... bigshot you're not
Your friends are talkin and I'm hearin that your girls are what?
You didn't know?  Go steal and rob
And while you're at it... go get a suit for a j-awhh-ob
You see you're actin like this urge is demandin
c'mon, wake up... have some understandin
Society's a weak excuse for a man
It's time for the brothers... rap is trying to take the stand
Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you deep
Guides you... and he watched you as you grew, plus
past the age of... a little child, that's true
But folks your age don't act like you do, so
so be mature... and put the point to a halt
And if you're over eighteen... I wish you'd act like an adult
Don't live in a world... of hate hate hate
Pull yourself together... and get yourself straight
Men don't steal... hey, most don't borrow
And if you smoke crack... your kids'll smoke crack tomorrow
So be more mature... and kids do your chores
Make your own money... hey, be proud that's yours
You know why, cause that's a man... that's brains no spite
Stayin out of trouble... when it comes in sight
And a man never loses a fight... in God's sight
Cause righteous laws are overdue
And this is a message that the Ruler Rick threw
And it's true

""You know, you know what, you know what, you know what?
 We like to party, like to party""

Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier

Well he's in indian town, and what spots his eye?
A nice looking indian, and honey looked fly
He had to talk because he just couldn't hack it
She wore some moccasins and plus a tough leather jacket
He trotted over and invented a line
He said excuse me, um, do you happen to have the time?
All was on his mind was sex, sex, sex
So she said why do ask? you got your own timex
To poor old dave that line was cold blooded
He felt that her ego was way over flooded
She started to laugh and then she started to say
I'm sorry some times I do get carried away
I didn't mean to like ill treat you
My name is running rabbit and I'm glad to meet you
He said I'm dave, with crazy clout
Oh you're the one the girls keep talking about
Yeah, you must be, because you look like a winner
Come to my house, we'll discuss it over dinner

Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier

Well, he met her father, big chief Beretti
He said what's for dinner?
Soup and spaghetti
The dinner was rotten and he swore he's gonna puke it
He never would have took it if he'd known that he had cooked it
Later on they were chilling, in the bedroom
Sitting at the window looking at the moon
Judging from the mood he swore she was hot
He said are you in the mood?
She said no I'm not
From what he believes and from what he gets
When a girl says no, he really thinks she means yes
So, he started touching her and coming out strong
Whispering sweet nothings and singing a song
He said
I'm in the mood for love,
Simply because you're near me,
Funny but when you're near me,
I'm in the mood, don't mean to be rude,
But I'm in the mood for love
She said oh dave, you've got my poor back hurting
I want you, but first close the curtain
He closed the curtain and also the doors
The next thing you knew it was off with those drawers

Take it easy Davy, you're hurting me. stop

Well, he was playing with her tits, they were soft not lumpy
And then he cracked the legs like Humpty-Dumpty
He's fucking, sucking, also finger popping
He had, no intention of stopping
Crazy fun, he did not want to leave
His head was between her tits and he could barely breathe
He had to toss, turn, turn, toss
Meanwhile he was riding her with crazy force
She was burning hot, she said stop, stop.
He said are you talking sex or what?
I guess she didn't realize what she started
Next thing you knew she was acting retarded
She said to him strangely and kind of merry
Stop now, or I'll be unable to marry
He didn't take her warning
He rode her till the morning
He rode that ass till the pussy started yawning

He said what? wait his dick went weak
It said dave, pussies ain't supposed to speak
He gathered his things he wanted to leave this place
But first he wanted to see the vagina face to face
He opened it up, with his bare two thumbs
He seen crabs with spears and indian drums!

""Wish me luck dear, I'm scared and I'm nervous""
So who stands, who falls, who crowds the halls

Now everytime I write dope raps they come vickin it
Now you know the title of this, so start lickin it
Lips kickin it, hey bitch, there is a brick in it
So when you think you're prepared, I keep stickin it
Now here they come with a spike to fight, take it light
Now who the one you're trying to be like with all your might
And anyone that attempted to remove me out the race

Now raise that vocal, play that role around your local hoods
Don't worry about a thing cause Ricky Rick is bringin home the goods
Who stands, who falls, who crowds the halls

So who will stands, who falls, who crowds the halls
This one the DJ calls... lick the balls!

GO Vance Wright!  GO Rick!  Look at the style we bring
How come you cannot write a rap that will erase the king
The girls you watch are now entranced now when they see me slam
Shit on motherfuckers and I tell them who the fuck I am
My name is Rick, but now you know who's rulin it
Pump the world and the DJ put the fuel in it
Come ride the dick and if you want to know what is the word
Who write the baddest raps you and your boys have ever heard
I eat you up and give your girl a bowl of Puppy Chow
You understand alright?  Hello! I'm tryin to tell you now
Who stands, who falls, who crowds the halls
This one the DJ calls... lick the balls!",Lick the Balls
Slick Rick,"Well I'm sittin on my lunch break, grinnin my teeth (my teeth)
It's the last day of the week, boy what a relief (relief)
My muscles kind of ache, they felt rigid and stuff
so I looked around, and I smoked this big fat spliff
Now I'm happy as can be I'm in this pothead spell
I put some Visine in my eyes so that no one can tell
It's 12:55 almost time for the bell
Put the breathmints in the mouth so that the mouth don't smell
Now back on the job, I don't bother no one
I keep strictly to myself and all my work gets done
Now the job's finally over it's time to have fun
and I'm hangin out with Trevor there's a kid named John
Got real drunker than a skunk and happy as can be
We went, to the Latin Quarters and we got in free
Scoopin all the girls like nuttin with my trunk jewelry
cause I'ma fly brown brother and you can't school me
Boogie Down was performin hey they ain't no joke
And a bunch of Brooklyn kids was lookin all down my throat
Was it my big chains with the big plates on em?
Then they rolled on me and told me to run em

This was the moment I feared...
""Hey yo homeboy take off your chains man
 Bout to hurt you real fuckin bad, I'm gonna fuck you up""
This was the moment I feared...
""Yo what's the matter stupid?  Take the shits off man!
 The fuck is up?""

I said, ""They're really not real, they're just a front for the girls""
Then a whole bunch of fists just, caved my world
I was in pain, so ashamed, I wish I had not came
Had to kindly pick up my face and then ride home on the train, then
I went to an open store that's where I brought/bought me a quart
Then I went to the park, and I sat and I thought
I seen Danny Boy though he's with his girl named Sarah
in one of his cars, I think this one's a Bravera
She calls out to me, but, I really couldn't hear her
So I went just a little bit closer so I'd hear a little clearer
She said, ""I need Veronica Blades that's right near Tilden""
I said, ""I know where that's at cause that's right next to my building""
I gave em the information and they went on their way
I went home, and there I slept til almost three the next day
Then someone knocked on my door, I opened up, no quit!
It was Sarah with some magazines and a bag named Kit
She tried to use me and seduce me and at first I wasn't with it
Then we did it and we did it and we did it and WE DID IT
She said it was great, she said she's glad we had done it
The elevator came and Danny Boy was on it

This was the moment I feared...
""Hey yo what the fuck's goin on here?
 What you doin to my girl homeboy?""
This was the moment I feared...
""Oh I just KNOW y'all didn't just finish fuckin
 I just KNOW y'all ain't just finish fuckin""

Well he was huffin and puffin and he swung at me -- word
So I pulled out my jammy and I silenced the nerd
Then he was dead two in the head I took the cash and the Visa's
She said, ""Don't worry about a thing just make sure nobody sees us""
We went back to her apartment, there was blow in the freezers
She said, ""We're rich we're rich we can have whatever will please us""
Now I don't hang with no one who ain't good for my health
So I put the sugarhead out and I went for self
Now I was rich as I was rich I could have whatever would please me
Now I could wear real gold in front of folks that would tease me
Yah me, I'll be a new neighborhood dad
Cats'll roll up on me screamin, ""Yo Rick my man!!""
I guess I was too fly word up I'm sorry to say
Ya see a cop rolled up on me and told me, ""Make my day""
I said, ""Relax brother,"" but he had proof that I had done it
Yah they had false hair on underwear with my fingerprints all on it
This was the rise and fall of my fast lane style
And I was the main event on the TV for a while
but now I'm in jail doin life and I'm scared
Some kids snuffed me cold and greased me where no one dared

This was the moment I feared...
""Turn around nigga (HAHAHAHA)
 Spread your cheeks""
This was the moment I feared...
""UHH, AOWWHWHWAA!  STOP STOP!  AHAOWWHAHAOOHO""",The Moment I Feared
Slick Rick,"Ladies, and gentlemen, and lowlifes
It is with outstanding pleasure
that we are here to present tonight,
Slick Rick, the Ruler!  And MC Ricky D!
Doing their smash hit, ""Mona Lisa,""
you know, like the picture?
Anyway, I'd like to take this time out
to bow before his divine majesty

Oh your majesty
Hmm?
Can I kiss your hand?
Mm-hm
(kisses his hand loudly)
Enough!
Come your highness, they await you

Well, it was one of those days, not much to do
I was chillin' downtown, with my old school crew
I went into a store, to buy a slice of pizza
And bumped into a girl, her name was Mona, what?
Mona Lisa (what?) Mona Lisa, so men made you..
You know what I'm sayin?  So I said, ""Excuse me, dear
my gosh, you look nice!
Put away your money
I'll buy that slice!""
She said, ""Thanks, I'd rather a slice of you
I'm just kidding, but that's awfully nice of you""
The compliment showed she had a mind in her
And when I smiled (ping!) I almost blinded her
She said, ""Great Scott!  Are you a thief?
Seems like you have a mouth full of gold teeth""
Ha-ha, hah!  Had to find that funny
So I said, ""No child, I work hard for the money
And calling me a thief?  Please!  Don't even try it (Right!)
Sit down eat your slice of pizza, and be quiet""
She almost got cut short, you know, scissors
She tried to disrespect who?!  The Grand Wizard
Me!  ""Well what's your name, son?""
""MC Ricky D,"" but not to be so harsh I said to Mona Li-hee
""I'm.. sorry and I know that's low class (uh, yeah)
Please sit, and tell me a little about your past""
She said, ""Well I got courage, and I don't like porridge (uh-huh)
I've never been to college, but I've got crazy knowledge (uh-huh)
Over eighteen and my eyes are green (uh-huh)
I wear more gold than that man on A-Team (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Trim, slim, (yeah) and I'm also light skinned
Best believe Mona's a virgin""
A virgin?!  Honey needed a slap
She tried to tell me she's a virgin, with her yea wide gap
I said, ""It don't matter, see, I'm not picky (word)
Let me spell my name out for you, it's Ricky,
R, ravishing
I, impress
C, Courageous; so careless
K, for the Kangols which I've got
that I wear everyday and
Y, why not?
To fight's not right that I recite and I'm
quite polite like Walter Cronkite""
Well, just about then, Trevor my friend came in
He said, ""Hey Rick, don't you know playin' with these snakes is a sin?!?""
He grabbed me by my shirt and pulled me right out the store
He said, ""I don't want to see you playin' with these lowlifes no more!
Now come along, we have a party to attend
With some real mature women and some more of her friends""
He hailed down a cab and he waited for a minute
And as the cab came, he thrusted me in it!
And as we were leavin' and drivin' along
I could hear a melody as Mona sang a song

""If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry, each time we meet
Walk on by, walk on by
Foolish pride
That's all that I have left, so, let me hide
The pain and the hurt that you gave me
When you said goodbye,
You walked on by..""",Mona Lisa
Slick Rick,"Hauk, who goes yonder?
It is I, sire, Richard of Nottingham
Well, speak up man, what is it?
News from the east, sire, Rick the Ruler has returned

Gather 'round party goers as if your still livin'
And get on down to the old Slick rhythm
Now this one here is called the Ruler my dear
Its a mere party booster that will set things clear
Its a hundred percent proof from champions of truth
And if you feel you need spirit I'll bring back your youth
Relax your mind, and folks unwind
And be kind to a rhythm that you hardly find
And off we go, let the trumpets blow
Well hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back

Now in these times, at least to me
There's a lot of people out here tryin' to sound like Ricky D
Not tryin' to cause trouble cause its really a small thing
But they're bitin what I'm writin
God it's great being the king
Some sound allright, but then they act illy
Try conquering my crown and that's really very silly
Now I'm not the type that gets upset
Try to disrespect folks just to earn respect
But learn this fact, whether white or black
I can't be conquered in my style of rap
For jealousy and envy are dumb ones tools
So Ricky says nothing, he keeps his cool
Revenge is not a mission that the Ruler's on
Just forgiveness required for the wrong that's done
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back

Hit it
Hit it 
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit it
Hit, hit it
Hit, hit, hit it 
Hit, hit it
Hit, hit it
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit it

Now one day when I was chillin' at this outside jam
I seen folks havin' a ball and plus clappin' their hands
To beats of records that conquer the streets
Like Pee Wee Herman and Clubhouse Treats
Girls was chillin', boys rule as usual
The slacks, the golds, the rings, I hope I'm not confusin y'all
But everyone in the house looks smashin'
Fresh clothes on their butts and nothing out of fashion
And just when you thought nothing couldn't get better
A news flash concealed in a bright yellow letter
A kid ran up to the mike and said ""Alert, hear this,""
Cleared his cloudy throat and then began to persist
He said ""Hallelujah, kids hear this
The Ruler's back and he's here to assist""
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back

Hit it
Hit it 
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit it
Hit it
Hit it 
Hit, hit it
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit it
Hit it
Hit it 
Hit, hit it
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit it

Hit it
Hit it 
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit it
Hit it

Slick Rick,"well I've been a public figure for quite a long time
known to the whole world for what [my style of rhyme]
but tonight let's talk about the ones who bite
although they know they won't [never get it right]
because they have no [class] and they have no [shame]
they'll bite another brother to boost their own [name]
get paid correct on a one way gimmick
I'm happy for you lowlifes but 'member there's a limit - so say

teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
it looks kinda easy like there was nothing to it
but they don't understand that the master will be
the creator of the style [Ricky D]
teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
it looks so easy like there was nothing to it
but they don't understand that the master will be
the creator of the style [Ricky D]

when I walk into a party cokesnorters laugh
as the girls be crazy coming for my mere autograph
and it seems that they aspiring my new style of rappin'
and brothers all around me out of vanity are snappin'
the girls say 'wow Rick you're so unique
please tell us how you organize the words you speak'
but my will says chill and I go upon my way
'cause class will be taught some other day - so say

teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
it looks kinda easy like there was nothing to it
but they don't understand that the ruler will be
the creator of the style [Ricky D]
teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
it looks so easy like there was nothing to it
but they don't understand the ruler will be
the creator of the style [Ricky D]

well I remember one night when the world was dead quiet
and out of nowhere some boy starts a riot
he tore my clothes, I had to throw blows
a shotgun barrel was dead on my nose
I froze - it was Big Foot and the Toes
yup, a bunch of small timers that (be it?) on my shows
surrounded the ruler with machetes too
they said um 'if you don't teach us how to rap you're through'
I said 'okay, now let me go, please'
I seen an officer - then the officer screamed 'freeze!'
he said 'Slick Rick you okay?'
I had to play it off, some girls were looking my way
so I smacked one in the face and told him 'I won't retire'
and many years from now I'll just be getting higher
for I am the master, set and done
my name is Ricky D and I'm the only one - so say

[...Ricky D] - [...Ricky D]

now when I was a lad my style was bad
so I had to use what little bit of knowledge that I had
so I quote and I wrote 'till I was up to par
some rhymes were [boo-hoo] and some rhymes were [hahahaa!]
I educate myself so I'm able to reach ya
answering the call of teacher, teacher
tell us how you do it, it's so easy for me
the creator of the style, emcee Ricky D
now my only task is to warn all biters
slimy sluts and fake rhyme writers
don't try your luck and get the ruler annoyed
for when I'm through with you boy your whole world will be destroyed
so chill mister muscle or I'll come and hunt ya
if you are a girl I'll make no man want ya
so if you want to rule and no (?) in the way
pay attention to my syllables and come see me and say hey hey

teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
it looks so easy like there was nothing to it
but they don't understand the ruler will be
the creator of the style [Ricky D]
teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
it looks kinda easy like there was nothing to it
but they don't understand that the ruler will be
the creator of the style [Ricky D]","Teacher, Teacher"
Slick Rick,"(Chorus: repeat 4x)
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again

[Verse One]
Aye sport, here's a thought from the old school crew
A serious situation we all go threw
It deals wit your feelins, so here what I say
It's like a dyke, but nothing seems to go your way
Bust this, two people, they really like each other
He says their's no one else
And she claims they're is no other
The feelins are same, and you receive a notion
To reveal your inner thoughts deeply hit emotions

(Chorus:4x)

[Verse Two]
Precious times, hopin they won't end
Tell your mother bout your lover
Or so your best friend
Ya mighty proud while your holdin her hand
Boys, yo that's my woman, and girls, yeah that's my man
This pressure brings a sort of warmth to ya heart
And everything seems so great at the start
For she loves him, and he also loves her
And it's hard to turn back to who the person you were
But later on, problems start to occur
And the bond, which combines, y'all turn into a blur
For the feelins were the same, now here's the score
You love him to much, and they don't love him anymore
Or did you have to choose a number
Or because your not bein true
Or maybe they're just plain sick of seein you
Word, now it might seem strange
You better take his quick, and make the right change

(Chorus: 4x)

[Verse Three]
See just when you swore, the boy was wrong and
Then they're gone, and part of ya heart's been stolen
Get back on your feet, wit a hop and a skip
But no, you rather go wit this dead relationship
Hangin around, and buyin him stuff
You seem him every darn day, you don't see him enough
You follow them around, and they claim ya hawkin
When conversation comes, you do all the talkin
Not to mention, attention, we all need a bit
Behind ya back they're sayin, yeah he's all on my tits
They're gettin sick of you, and quite annoyed
And if you had plans for the future, they're now destroyed
You saw what was happenin, and you still let it
And if you ever let him  make love to ya girl, you can forget it
Sweetheart, you been caught, spread around town
Passin then ya thoughts
And break up time, and your recitine the words
Yo this is fromt the heart, and I know the part hearts
Get over it, from now don't take short slick
If it's not true love, you shouldn't deal wit it
Just think of your future, and what is to come
And pay attention to the words that's in this song, they go

(Chorus: 4x)

Do you know, where ya goin to
Do like the things that life is showin you
And are you going to...",Teenage Love
Slick Rick,"Here's an oldie but goodie
Hit it
Excuse me
What?
Can I have your attention?
Mn-hmm
There's just a few things that I've got to mention (Uh-huh)
There's girlies out here that seem appealing
But they all come in your life and cold hurt your feelings
I'm telling you
As Rick is my name
I wouldn't trust not girl unless she feels the same
Treat 'em like a prostitute (Do What?)
Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop
'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample
Listen up close, here comes my first example

Now ya been with your girlfriend for quite a while
Plans for the future, she's having your child
Celebrate with friends drinking cans and quarts
Telling all your friends about your family thoughts
One friend was drunk so he sstarts to act wild
He tells the truth about the kid
It's not your child
Acting like a jerk and on his face was a smirk
He said, ""Your wife went berserk while you was hard at work""
And she led him on and tried to please him
She didn't waste time, she didn't try to tease him

Treat 'em like a prostitue (Do What?)
Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop
'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample
Listen up close, here comes my second example

It's your wife
You buy the tramp jewels and clothes
You get sentimental and bring home a rose
Give her everything 'cause you swear she's worth it
All your friends tell you, ""The bith don't' deserve it""
Love is blind, so there goes your wealth
Until one day, you see things for yourself
Came home from work early, Mr. Loverman
You had a card and some candy in your right hand
There's the mailman, he was short yet stout
He went inside your house and didn't come back out
Bust it
Just a friendly stop, come on, is it?
The mailman comes and he pays your wife a visit?
The thought alone makes your temperature boil
You say to yourself, she might still  be loyal
You open up your door and stand in a trance
You see the mailman's bag and the mailman's pants
Came home to party
At work had a hard day
Look around your house and you say, ""Where the hell are they?""
Run upstairs up to your bedroom
You look inside your room, you see something brewin'
Cover your mouth because you almost choke
You see the mailman's dick way up your wife's throat

Treat 'em like a prostitute (Mm-hmm)
Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop
'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample
Listen up close, here comes my third example

Now your girl, she don't like to have sex a lot
And today she's ready and she's hot, hot, hot
As you open up the door she says, ""Get on the floor""
She wants to try things she's never tried before
She takes off your drawers and works you over
She calls you Twinkles
And you call her Rover
Next thing you know, the ho starts to ill
She says, ""I love you, Harold"" and your name is Will
That's not the half 'til you start to ride her
Take off your rubber and there's one more inside her
It's not yours-who can it be?
I think it was a slick rapper, his name is M.C. Ricky

Treat 'em like a prostitute
Don't treat no girlie well, treat no girlie well
Treat no girlie well, until you're sure of the scoop",Treat Her Like a Prostitute
Slick Rick,"Yeah, boy!
Check it out Slick, ya know what I'm sayin?

No complaining
I reached my destination and its raining
I'm in Columbia, the Bond steps off the plane and
I hear a hollar from a bro with ring around the collar
Its chief of police, grease Bond, tell me to follow
Treated me to everything, no taxin, maxin
Gives me a hotel suite for me to relax in
Seems everyone was in my silk drawers
A cloud does it have to bug me a daffy nerve
Jumpin out the closet, word up, dead nigga
Said ""Chief how do you figure tryin to arrest me, the Double for the
murder of the nigga?""
Now in a cell, but not for long, and now I'm out, I hear a weeping
One asleep, other sleep, kept creeping
Bumped into another, my appearance was alarming
(To who) some lady that thought I'm charming
Please, the way I is I don't even have to say hon,
So who's a Don?
You better believe the nigga keeps girls fond,
The name's Bond!

Well, I'm outside and its the chief with twenty thiefs like the brainiac

Aware because the Double 0 was bucking like a maniac
Till nobody lives, so hon, nowhere to do correct
Said ""excuse me baby, but where they hiding the hooker at?""
""Around the block, but chill at least chill till the storm has stopped""
Decided it was a helicopter, sounds like its warming up
Grabbed ya leg, shot the chief, someone said ""Stop hawking""
Shook me off at twenty-thou, the Bond got up walking
They was laughing as they left they grew thinner like Iraqi,
Got the plans from the dying chief of police in her pocket
To make it even worse honey girl was definitely rattin
Was holding her in a club that was happening in Manhattan
I'm on the plane in the day seemed nothing was a phasing,
Except for the stewardess jocking the Amazing,
But kept my composure, had another honey hon,
Who the Don?
Better believe the nigga keep girls fond,
The name's Bond!

Back at home in New York, I didn't want to get too overfly
You want to know why I pulled out my 535i? (pimp!)
Boy I see some lookouts with some girls that's annoyed
It was a private engagement for the dealer and the boys
Double just passed the hoods with their faces painted
Walked in, say a good twent girls fainted
Throw cousins all out but seems that everyone was shitting,
And man I was so cool I even carried me a kitten (reowr!)
Trouble for the Double 0?  Wouldn't swallow that
Who's the man with the Golden Guuuuun and all of that
Turned curls of mercy, left blood on the walls of
Rescued the shorty who was all on the walls of
Whore said ""You're late!""  I don't want to hear none of your dissing
Nabbed the cash, made a good twenty million on the mission
Good job, not to mention had the balls honey hung
So who's a Don?
Better believe the nigga keeps girls fond
The name's Bond!",Bond

Call me the freaker, I bump it in ya speaker
Week on my birthday, met this girl named Tameka
Astonishing creature, made the rest look tired
Desired, that was the beauty I admired
Out by the 41 Brook, no joke
Can I have a toke, finally, she smiled and smoked
Gave the girl my number, though I still felt rejected
Hectic, called me more than I expected
Months passed by, even lived together and all
Dream come true, until suddenly a call
Oh brother, why do I discover
My honey, Tameka, yeah callin me another
It started again, it offend and I pretend
Mistakes of a woman in love with other men

""How low can go""/""Hold it now"" (4X)

[Slick Rick]
Well, tried to block it out my mind, here it was again:
Other men, confronted lady and she said he was a friend
Didn't believe her, she packed, brave her
Strange behavior, so silly, we forgave her
Late again Thursday, alone Rick sat
Left flat, look in the mirror and I wonder where she at
Gave the girl my heart and soul, it's after 10
And again couldn't manage if she slept wit other men
Out wearing my jewelry so you know she looked truck
Struck 3 o'clock, here she come, fishy like a fuck
Come and let me smell you, I wanted to say to hell you
Hi honey, sorry I'm late, but let me tell you
It's a fast chat, need the phone, slow rollin
Could you go to the store and get some soda 'cause they open
Again it offend and I pretend
Mistakes of a woman in love with other men

""How low can go""/""Hold it now"" (8X)

[Slick Rick]
Strike one, strike two, no exaggeration
Try to play it off like it was my imagination
Beer mix wit alcohol, help me to forgive
Deal wit weak minded and I have no where to live
I deserve honesty, get treated it like a pet
I should be in list, but no I still can't forget
Put the cards on the table, don't get loud, cut the bull out
If you slept wit another man, I'm strong enough to pull out
She confess and then she left, smooth
Wanted to kill myself 'cause to live ain't the move
Broke-hearted again, it offend and I pretend
Mistakes of a woman in love with other men
Once again it offend, and I pretend
Mistakes of a woman in love with other men
Once again it offend, and I pretend
Mistakes of a woman in love with other men
Once again it offend, and I pretend
Mistakes... in love with other men

As you see Ruler show's, is enquirin noses
Goin into a story about a kid named Moses
Once a prophet was to be born, so for anything else furve it
Fear of orders, every first born, some murdered
One got away, a girl wit profit for a river
Gently put him in a basket, went floatin down a river
Then hands up by a fair up relative, or honey peep it
Couldn't be the severed, once determined to keep
Don't say a word, she told this slim, who was a real witch
Snitch, it'll definitely be the last day you breathin
Wild kids slaughter, 'cause they was fronted them
Soldiers tellin the kid that they murdered every one of them
Thanks said Pharaoh, guys little friend tips
Sister showin her baby sayin her River God sent it
To a brother who arose and said, ""whoa sis""
Cure as I suppose this, the upward knows about Moses

[Slick Rick]
As time passes, prove he wasn't the type to beg or borrow
Group to conquer land like ain't no tomorrow
Made the Sun King jealous 'cause he couldn't do a moldin
Pops I'm not to happy the way you jackin this Moses
Some dish rap behavior ruins every piece of bash
Though I complain, where's the several action build
You piece of trash, tree or switch
Mo' you buildin, and find your cream's hero
Built it, anything else, you need Pharaoh
Come to star this, this my crown
One say ""How can he"" but since not takin any chance
He threw the hooker off the balcony
But word sold out to King, he bank cold cuts blessed
Stripped him of his honors and dumped him in the desert
But I'm return for the people, this chest about saw
King said ""You want war? Make brick without straw""
That's a son not being king, and shorty knows good roses
When I be, suppose this the upward knows about Moses

[Slick Rick]
The new King said, S be the threats, filled wit stuffing
Oh boy, what do I do? Now pray to prophet
Then a vision said chill and prophecy fill
Scorm build, hells of fire, or there first born killed
It's gettin scary for the king, he made the sufferin go by Mario
You win, take these peasants and get the fluck outta my area
More villains, still in heat, didn't want my 2 to fill him
Wasn't chillin, then I flat sent the troop to go and kill him
So more, prophecy, when a crossing said run him
Did some ol' abracadabra and water fell upon him
The soldiers that is, since Moses was suave
Then Mo' and the mounds havin a convo wit the father
Came back in the tens, seen panty hoes dropin
Partner suave, folks wasn't into what po-pop was poppin
So the Earth shouldn't kill those, bible takes clothes
Talked about a time when not the worst spit foes and met Moses

One day fishing heard Indian drums
Saw a brother listen to, wife kissin to
Then on another mission to
The city of a sister, it was a far distance
There was a ranger outta area they needed my assistance
Tuesday of the cash, last man that rob pimpy
He never returned, I said ok and put the money in the fin
And then he bumped into this girl
who like that girl that more come Indian
How I sex a white trick, jockin me she Indian
Comin in on this feet, and comin hopin a chance for ropin in
How'd you like to put your Indian tee in my opening
So that was a deed, 'cause a nigga wasn't new to this
True to this, double barrel slide out the uterus
Calm, started singin sad popular songs
Took the money and the hon', screamin at the top of her lungs
You won a hundred per a reefer, once about to smoke a blunt
Know, run wit up fronto, screw a girl pronto, mean Tonto

[Indian and horse samples]

[Slick Rick]
Was extremely pissed, still picturin screwin this
I don't know why the fuck I'm doin this
New since, on the horse tracks, whose to choose
Sad or loose, both thirst or a cactus full of juice
All of a sudden, these women like model hoes in Paris
Then don't hate me the Indian, I was so embarrassed
Don't pull a kid a minute, to give in within a minute
Til I seen a shaggy condo, or a couple livin in it
Shouldn't have, friendly manner, though she pack her up and ran her
Coudln't stand the finer fellas like she wanted some banana
Led me to the back of the house, the hands that started trife
Used it as my marks and then I nearly had a heart attack
Brush it off, deal wit the floss, way past disgusted
Said what's the matter granny? Is your blood ass dusted
Back in the hunt, now what he want, poor granny offer me a blunt
No not without fronto, screw girl pronto mean's Tonto, grandma

Found a small timers after all, wasn't her family prone
Without my 45, now y'all up against the wall
Where's the hooker and the money, here she came, sweatin mind
Then the bitch she pull a pistol on my far behind
Now she a smartish, should of figured when gettin off the highway
So the horse busted in, startin lettin off the shotty
Killed the men, slapped the girl, didn't I tell you start traffic
Come on Rick, a horse carriage, that's what the fuck happen
We the folks, bleadin, size men, I please them
Indeed, don't ever touch a killer bitch, no I need her
Plan a role, better yet, well is your pole up
Signals from the west say what the hell is the holdup
Though she scare the honey, hit the switch there's to run it
Caught a savage back the hooker, said bitch where's the money
Gave it up hunter, she wants a brother so it's fronto

As I'm sweepin through an alley in New York, a stray kitten
Dog chase a couple of blocks, shocks, tough being a fox
He in a tux, check the scenario, he stuff me in a box
A hundred home, why you cry, we went just like wine, 'cause
A appreciate of me, and kitten like writers
'cause of my tongue, wonder why I hits and unhand the fly kid
To cut a bishop like she needed a home or a knockin
Word, bit her off another like, not a committee, hit her off
Not to mention, sweatin the kitty really off
Had to do this, ain't no regular see the ruler's
Wit this rich white lady sayin ""Ain't he the cutest?""
Clerk said on real estate, so in the car, we'ze awate

Let me hug her for the million, and again, great this vill-i-an
Huggin me so much, she almost suffocate the brilliant
Sad eyes, plus she had a bad pad, nice
Said have to do my share of work, the hooker had mad mice
Was like a fleet of them niggas, though was kind of fun to be
Ill treatin them, clean 'em in, plus I thought was gonna eat them
Cat food, this ain't none to me, see a rat, you come run
More like hunt to me, you want to get this shit from in front of me
From Thanksgiving to, please now shout for somethin
Can a nigga get some in, she wouldn't let me out for nothin
I guess I could be called a brat, now a jolly want a fat
So let me rub my head all up against her, so she think she all of that
And every day of the week, sweatin was like a sand of stayin
Would you lay off? I'm watchin Prince of the Wales
You're in the way-o, mouse craze across the room

Now come and the sex triggers, and his penis stiffer

In position as he coach this, doin the mood by the 'proach this
And when the bitch she clean the house, 
you wouldn't have so many roaches
But still she buggin and he comin, and the naughty wit the hut
He fall asleep, burglar come, up shorty get the shotty
Find me out, and nothin stun him, the hoes did love him
Feed on a bitch, got up and chase me til she heard it
What was that? Got her gun, she had a dozen, mad loud
And for a over honey lady, definitely that wasn't a bad shot
Police came and all of that, and now I hear her off, wonder her

Slick Rick,"As a youth, each Sunday, Dawn went to Church and
Paid her respects and not to mention was a virgin.
Kid pushed up, Dawn lettin' him
Since he made her laugh and all the other girls was sweatin' him.
Then things started to move without cause
And a couple o'months later kid's pushin' for the drawers.
Under pressure while exchangin' glances
Dawn finally gives in to the sexual advances.
Although it was a mad high cost for her
'cause' after the thrill was gone, so was the lust for her.
Eventually he left her for another.
Now feeling alone and betrayed by her lover
She cried--for no longer knew which way she headed.
Once dreamed of actually wearing white at her wedding
And really being pure, now she thought she'd die without.
Still she finds strength to continue with her life without
Love...
Without love...
Without love...
Without love...

Verse two of Dawn's life--the second segment.
What could be worse than to now find out you're pregnant?
Poor Dawn couldn't sleep--laid awake
Not ready for a child and plus her mother's gonna break.
As she doesn't know how she's gonna bring up the subject,
Consequences of being used as an object.
In church though time's runnin' thin
She decides to have the child because the doesn't want to sin.
Props to the girl although it hit hard times;
It was Hell finishin' school and working part-time.
Yet Dawn did it though her youth went to waste.
Little help from the government, she got her own place.
HARD for an indepentant woman and a kid
And as soon as she could get off the assistance, she did.
Without no man who she once thought she'd die without
Still she finds the strength to continue with her life without
Love...
Life without love...
Life without love...
Continue with her life without love...

While Dawn worked two jobs tryin' to meet ends,
Her son was busy cuttin' school and hangin' with his friends.
So when she got words she tried to slap out the taste in his mouth
And explain how important education is.
Under stress, she takes two Bufferin.
Son now tired of seein' his poor mother sufferin'.
Starts to sell drugs though the cops did a raid.
Guess who's in the mix, and being legal age
Could do time, please call her employer
To inform her that her son is gonna' need a lawyer.
Never no good news, just more strife.
Dawn barely havin' enough time to live her own life.
Here's the judge's sentence, beggin' and pleadin'.
Now spends nine hours on the bus to go and see him.
Here's the judge's sentence, beggin' and pleadin'.

It turned out, I had to stab him in the eye wit a pencil
State of shock, he made a yell, I said, now what you want traitor
C.O. puts me in the bin, I see ya about a month later
Back in population, didn't matter that his friends tensed
The phone prints, the years added to the sentence
Still chilling and all of that and I escape
When I don't think so, don't hit the stove cause they made a rape attempt
Thank goodness, failed, call out next, he wail out
Here go the C.O., ""Ricky Walters, pack up, you're bailed out""
The C.O. couldn't see the rape, the kid'll snitch mass figure

Come from the heart things spark 
And keep your eyes glued to the top of the chart 
Oh shit, its the man with the fronts and the jewels 
The kids with the blunts and the tools 
Sewing up shop like needles 
Selling more record than the Beetles

Slick Rick,"(singing)
Something tells Rick he's a fool
To let girls treat me so cruel
But never-the-less, Rick said ""You got me waiting""
Sitting in my car, waiting for yoooooooooou-ooh-ooh, lalalala

I got a girl, but I'm about to switch all that
Because my girl be trying to play me like the bitch all that
Shoot, clocked her daughter, for acting out of order
To impress a girl who to me knocked her out the water!
But because the kid swears love
Though when I see her friend its like the shit wears off
I don't bother, while she want to kiss and then cuss and full of hate
Get her friend?  Mission Impossible
Because she's the one the hon chose to boast to
The way that her and the bitch is so close to be a waste
So make music in my basement
Don't cut her off till I find a good replacement
One day I jumped in my Jeep, drove her to her friend's
house, cause the hon was sleeping over
My girl was acting fine, then the slime switched
want to diss, I said ""It's over you waste of time BITCH""
Tried to kiss her friend, twice then a third
She said ""Stop, Rick"", but didn't tell her friend a word
I went to bed, here come my girl touching me intently
Snuck out early, girlfriend wasn't acting as friendly as before
Because she swore a nigga hit her
""Well if you ain't love her why'd you go back to bed with her?""
But I didn't, now the hon badgering
I don't know, maybe it's me, maybe I'm imagining the love affair

(singing)
Got Rick sitting right here
Waiting for you my dear
Wondering if you're ever gonna show, you hoe

Another brother out for one thing, mistook him for
Steady relationship is what I'm really looking for
Sincerity, scoop the hon I done it
I said ""Being straight up, it's you I really wanted""
Though she fucked niggas with money like MAD
I still found myself wanting the honey quite bad
Loyal to her friend, though she wanted wood
Then we did it, boy that pussy was good
""But what if shorty finds out?""
Never be too clever
""Rick, she has to know if we're to ever be together""
Chill, then we started to button the strap and
Then my girl woke up, we acted like ain't nothing happened
Later on, my girlfriend stormed in
""We going to the supper club, some kid's performing
Bye, see you later"", 
Her girlfriend hot, then stopped living, Rick decide to follow
I'm outside of the club sipping a beer through the best can
Both sluts were sliding numbers to the next man
Contradicting of words being together
My girl, too, I should've known, birds of a feather
Back in my Jeep, about 4:11
Popped another can, looked up to the heavens
I'm a good man, in fact I know that I am
And I deserve a lady love, that's why I'm wondering why I'm...

(singing)
Sitting in my car, waiting for yoooooooooou-ooh-ooh, lalalala
Got Rick sitting right here
Waiting for you my dear
Wondering if you're ever gonna show, you hoe

But never-the-less, Rick said, you got me waiting

So you get my point son, 
you just don't trust no bitch, you know what I'm sayin?
""Okay, daddy, I understand""
Cause bitches ain't no good, you know what I'm sayin?
""Okay, I get your point""
Anyway, listen to this, check it out

1994, as the world gets trifer,
I'm wondering, the fuck I need a woman in my life for? (ya know)
Cause its like a nigga whole history
With you hoes been nothing but misery
First rater, five-one stood
Mad coke fiend though the bitch looked good
Met her at the fever
""What's going on, stranger?""
And like a fool took her in and tried to change her
I don't who I thought I's bluffing
That BITCH wasn't giving up that coke for nothing
""Oh you trying to dis, mister bougeois nigga
Yet back in the day, you used to smoke coke cigarettes too,
That type shit you ain't admitting""
Because, homegirl, I grew out of it, you didn't
Anyway, dead out of order
Came in with a sheepskin her ex-lover bought her
Who gave you that?
""My ex""
I said ""Who?""
Believe she had the nerve to say ""You can wear it too""

When I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new
Someone who would be true
Yes I should find someone who would be true

(Singing)
Cause Ricky needs a love that's true
Truuuuuuuuuuue, oh dear, scooby dooby doo
Scooby doo doo

Then I met Sin,
Sweating the viking
A brown skinned fox, slim just like I like them
""What?  Sweating you?  Picture that, nerd.  Please""
Anyway, the bitch had herpes!  (you know)
Imagine me, the fool being the spouse
Doctor said I couldn't catch it unless I got aroused
Found out snooping in her bag what she got
Now why you ain't tell me?  You worthless slut!
""Because I loved you at the time and couldn't afford to""
You know homegirl should get the Oscar award for her lying
Anyway, stayed with the creep
One day, Sybil here, talking in her sleep
""Chris, wait,"" the bum bitch said
So loud till a motherfucker fell out the bed
Who the hell is Chris?  She putting up resistance
Until I caught her calling the nigga long distance
Had the nerve to dis patch loving
Boy am I lucky that I didn't catch nothing

When I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new
Someone who would be true
Yes I should find someone who would be true

(Singing)
Cause Ricky needs a love that's true
Truuuuuuuuuuue, truuuuuuuuue
Indeed, I need a love that's true
It seems I need a love that's true
Oh dear, scooby dooby doo
Oh gosh, Scooby doo doo-ooh (doo-ooh)

Though happy I was free
The need for love was still in me
Got to the point where the need for it was killing me
Then I met short here, hanging with my cousin
Found out later how young the bitch was and
Though I done hit it and she opened up a world
And remind me of that song ""Go Away, Little Girl""
It had to end because the bitch weren't loyal, and spoiled
""That's because I had you pussy whipped royal""
You see the type of shit a nigga was gonna marry?
You see the type of attitude the BUM BITCH carry?
Like oil and water, impossible mixture
Then temper tantrums came into the picture
Yelling (ahhhh), carrying on bad and cursing
Complete embarrassment to The Ruler as a person
""Gimme shorts""
Ruler will not permit you
Then she goes wild, starts breaking up my furniture
Flirts too, excuse me, a whore
Like the world's worst groupie when I brought her on tour

So when I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new
Someone who would be true
Yes I should find someone who would be true

(Singing)
Cause Ricky needs a love that's true
Truuuuuuuuuuue, truuuuuuuuue
Indeed, I need a love that's true
It seems I need a love that's true
Oh dear, scooby dooby doo
Oh gosh, Scooby doo doo
Ricky needs a love that's true-hoo-hoo",Sittin' in My Car
Slick Rick,"Well I shot some there, then I copped some beer
And did a show up in West Bubblefuck somewhere
Due to raps wider ratio, satellites to Nato
Hillbilly draws flew on the stage like tomatoes
Apparently more mack than I thought
Unfortunately wife piece back in New York
And I'm starvin
Being human and open with
A mad fine hillbilly woman was scoping Rick
Thought entered how to lean and bent it
Though I'm not gonna lie I was extremely tempted
(To what, Rick?) To discharge in a sista
Next thing in the dressing room, ""Pardon me, mister""
Yes, I said cautiously
""Crazy, but possibly 
you could sign your name on the back of these Dazy Duke shorts for me""
Try to resist, now girlfriend startin' it
The pen won't write, ""You can press down hard on it"" -
Now my hand browsing her South end
Spun around about to shove my tongue in her mouth when
Rring! - Loosen the grip my hell had
My girl, she was talking so nice I felt bad
Being untrue, no telling what it might do to her
""I love you"", forced to say I love you back too to her
Any thought of getting pussy was doomed to:""You got a wife?"" 
Anniversary comin up soon too
Got off the phone, cock just got mute
Don't get me wrong it's not like you're not cute (Uh-huh)
I'm wrong for mistreating her, the wanting to skeeting her
""I understand, goodbye, it was real nice meetin' ya""
What an angel overcoming his wrongness
The moral I am trying to get across in this song is

If goodness is what you're filling your soul with
And want to find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keeps no secret, like who they creep with
Realise early it's a 2 way street, kid (Say what?)
Goodness is what you're filling your soul with
And want to find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keeps no secret, like who they creep with
Realise early it's a 2 way street, kid

Casually seating with some thick chords eating
With my album playing at a big board meeting
""I love this"", being the coolest and the ruffest
A big willie woman pulls the Ruler in her office
And fixed a wedge in her garment, unsteady my heart went
'Cause her office looked like a three bedroom apartment -
Pounding was inevitable
She said to me ""Rick, I think your album is incredible""
The way the hon' upon I, comin' on a sun I
""You're so darn sexy with that patch over your one eye""
Well I'm glad you think it's boomin' and I catch ya
Means a lot to me, coming from a woman of your stature
I mean, who could resist the Don head?
Start caressing Rick private, kiss me on the neck
And I can't be held accountable if down her gown I pull
Girlfriend pussy look plump and poundable
She sweats the set me emporer
Put one of your legs up on the desk and let me enter ya
Fantastic, though I start to act drastic
When I see my wedding band 'pon the bitch left ass cheek
Deep down, she felt that I tried to diss
I'm like, I can't do this as much as I'd like to miss
An angel overcoming his wrong, kids
The point that I am trying to get across in this song is

If goodness is what you're filling your soul with
And want to find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keep no secret, like who they creep with
Realise early it's a 2 way street, kid (Say what?)

Well, let us skip the boring foreplay I'm slidin' right in 
This girl over my house who had to be about 19
Ass, hoes in my poster 
She's sweatin' although she tried to hold her composure
I hoped she'd take it in the ass and suck dick
(Girl) My my what a nice apartment you got Rick
On her knees about to make her fall 
(Girl) ""All platinum and gold jammies hangin' on the wall too, 
you got it goin' on""
Now my mouth start foamin' 
The lights dim we're kissin' and my hands start roamin' in her drawers 
(Girl) Stop!
Knew she was joking 
cause I ain't even fuck her and her pussy was soaking WET!
Already had her tit out 
If I play my cards right, fuck her dig in the hole she shit out 
(Girl) Rick I gotta go my girls waitin'
She recaps finally when honey drawers down to her kneecaps 
Breathed heavy all mushy bitch 
Swore up and down I was gonna fuck her in the pussy
Since friends waitin' on subtle 
Bout time to make a move upon the hungry little butthole
Meanwhile she acted quite passive 
lickin' the hun neck while she lotionin' that ass with jelly
Tit hung out the frame nigga loco
Surprised honey didn't put up too much of a struggle, at first
Sinkin' in she ain't know how to be the bitch went 
(Girl) ahh Rick it hurts take it out of me!
Knocked my magazine down, bitch threw my papers 
You want to keep it down I mean I do have neighbors!
Squirmin' away although the table was barrin' her 
Felt real good my dick was sunk so far in her
She said it felt like a bull dowser barrin her 
Sqealin about she couldn't take it anymore in her
My cummed on her straight in the perm in her, (here) 
As I drained every last drop of sperm in her (where)

Chorus:

So girls when we kiss and we cuddle, ain't no way to put it subtle 
when I want the butt hole!
(Moaning in back round)

Another girl I met, her experience fast because 
Most girls wit kids don't be hit in they ass before
Picked her up sunset 
(Girl) Don't be late for dinner, ma
Bringin' honey home from the date at the cinema
Thinkin' how to fuck the ass so plottin', 
blown in the elevator, hit the stop button
She smiled, by knowin' her butt I want to bore   
I said ""Can I have a kiss now instead of in front of your front door""
(kissing/sex in the back round) (Uhhhmmm!! Oh yeah!)
Although the rule I tried not to push hard, 
I'm all over the bitch like an octopus 
Deep down I know she also want to fuck 
Though I kept my tongue in her mouth so not to put her on the spot
To have to talk no shit to prevent me from bonin' 
Unzap the bra, when the hooker start moanin and 
Expose my espresso suck on her and lick on her 
Unbucklin' pullin' out mad long dick on her
Panties in the way of that, but I want to check it out
Slipped her wet drawers down her thigh and took her leg out
Her butt was juicy kinda fat, 
spun around start to stick her in the pussy from the back
She came, mad juice dripped out, 
still in the pussy then acted like it slipped out
Cum on the floor, She said ""Pardon the puddle"" 
Spread open her cheeks, pushed hard in her butt hole 
Uhhhmmm, wasn't a bad date at all, she went AHHHH AHHHH
Start pullin' at my balls while I'm still penetratin' 
Felt fantastic, she said 
(Girl) ""Rick I'm not really into this ass kick""
Meanwhile Rick cummin' by the gallon, 
put your hands on the wall please
And try an' keep your balance
Lickin' the grill in her, meanwhile fillin' her 
Till sperm start pourin' out her butt hole while I'm still in her
Then start rammin' the pine in her 
I almost picked her up with these final grinds in her

Chorus:

So girls when we kiss and we cuddle, 
ain't no way to put it subtle when I want the butthole!

Ever see me with my jewels and toast from off of Mo'?
*psssh*  Past where handsome measures
like the whole entire Rat Pack, AND some precious
And chartable, such a big spark I pull
Nuns even say, ""That motherfucker's remarkable!""
And aliens who came to earth gathering
""Great gosh the man has soul, we must have him""

forced good men to pull out and start to murder folk

Fine grown Pine-Sol
Heavenly rhyme throne
Remember when you were young in the 70 time zone
Stages, ages about seven I say kid
The dress code of our parents looked awfully outrageous
Not down on em, games and clownin
When soul was at it's highest rate like James Brown 'n them
??, A groovy era acting
Member seeing Shaft in the movie theater back then?
I feel Richard Roundtree got 'em a fly deal
Black man wearin' bell bottom and high heels
Laughed a lot, some action mass production
Remember when cars were darn near half a block long?
Parents were so into that crap
Bunch a sweet memories to us older rap cats
Muhammad Ali knucklin in tournament
Pimp daddy hats with buckles and ornaments
How we forget snappy
Five people sleepin' in one matress and yet happy
Could even make sex seem sour 
As I impress the world with my extreme power, cause

Chorus: repeat 2X

Rick make memories sealed in almanacs
Not to mention the immence appeal the mack hat
When you wake up in the morning (redeem from any crap)
Because I bring that love and feeling back to rap

[Slick Rick]
For situated as poor beneficialator
cool-Aid couldn't last a hot minute in the 'frigerator
School notes, slidin and stealin, hidin 'em
Bazooka, bubble gum cartoons still inside of 'em
No way same essence of ?
Pimps flyest dressin' muthafuckas, weren't they?
But hood lies, you afraid of a good wine?
I used to love the actor who portrayed one on Good Times
You need a friend to ? a soul, man it kinda slow
One thing 'bout a bro, overflow when it ?
Life, a pitiful game
'Member the robot?
That was my shit on Soul Train
Got hyped to, psyched to, 
And the feelin's right to chillin' on the fire 
escape on a nice night too
No, I'm not gon' try to hurt the ?
Remember ride on blood and dry turkey slang?
Brothers chippin' in for alcoholic money
When you look at old flicks don't we all look funny?
Could even make sex seem sour 
As I impress the world with my extreme power, cause

Chorus

[Slick Rick]
Yo' mama, damn we used to talk improper then
Member when we used to walk bop, walk bop again?
Givin' them the rythym that we bought
Push our hand back like we was swimmin' when we walked
Bad all about, Huggie Bear, Rat all about
Member afros, what the fuck was that all about?
Buenos noches accents too...friends too
Everybody had a lot of roaches back then too
Profusely around us, Loosley ?
Fleets wearin' Bruce Lee Bandanas
And kick shit, ballin the hand I stick wit'
?????
Most cases, fatha' away for good
Local Flat Foot was part-of the neighborhood
Standard, and the panthers (Wow)
Used to dress like Erykah Badu and Amanda's now
Could even make sex seem sour
As I impress the world with my extreme power, cause

Slick Rick,"One of the greatest rapper, walk - I'm sayin'
In the field makin' my brick without hayin'
Mad busy kid, nah whip cut here
You, boy, drop your bundle bring your butt in
A soldier, what I do to that hood?
""Are you that slave everybody tellin' me rap good?
Calm down, not goin' ta murder ya
Clean yourself, Pharaoh said he want to have a word with ya""
My mom, pop, look concerned
After takin' a shower, dress and returned
The soldier, kinda on the dark end
Brought me and the motherfucking palace was barking
In the midst, a poet, dryin'
Pharaoh and his girl being entertained by him
Motherfucker got some nerve
said ""Bring slave forward, let me observe""
He asked me my name and start badger me
""Ricky, what?"", 'Ricky, your majesty'
And bowed because I had to, 
Kick a rap that shit better sound fat too

Who rotten 'em
Plaits swing, but have you forgotten 'em
Biggest big shouts since King Tut and 'em (who rotten 'em)
Kids ville, motherfucker couldn't sit still
All bitches is open off Rick's grill (who rotten 'em)
definitely exort, any stalkin'
Hawk gawkin' at silk fabrics when I'm walkin(who rotten 'em)
Fondle with right, yet, spec get delighted
All a that jungle shit, whites rap

""He's fat"" queen said to the Pharaoh excited and
did seem obvious the rap delighted him
Then start banging on appliance (Yes your honour?)
""Send this other rapper to the lions"" (Please, no!)
Pleaing with merit, if you kill him for my sake
My raps will do the spirit
'Please let him live, I prefer that'
""OK, well, send him where this slave used to work at""
Do or die jammin' me into
Even was allowed to move the family in too
Any beat better rap good on
Even gave me mad nice outfits to put on
Knowing that my rap stlye bumped many
And expecting some important company
The king visits where I was put to write
""Slave, you're behind, better rap real good tonight""
In other words, lay your mack down
'Cause these cats not the one to sound wack round
So that night, when they summers be them clapping
Took a deep breath and then began rapping

Who rotten 'em
Tryin' a find out what excite, what I write, 
What ignite with
Lion never once tried to bite Rick
Excusely, assumed to meek, refuse to greet
A smoother geek, just move ya feet
Shocked all dippin' and stoppin'
Even slave owner wanted me to whip a man, fucker
Shakin' any prison, kickin' back, sick of crap
And sista breakin' when a nigga rap

Well it was obvious the raps unpluggin'
Dignitaries spat wine out they mouth, buggin'
This they never heard that type a tactic
Gold sandles all over their fat steps
One dignitary over what man said
""I'll give you half the eastern border if you sell him""
Back at the rest spot to nap a bit
Mom! Pop! They delighted with the rapper did
""Son"", my mom said sweepin' up
""That lunatic'll kill you if you don't keep it up""
What's wrong with you, ""Son, I'm not scornin' you
Leave your best for a rainy day, I'm warnin' you""
Ripped my ego apart
So I set upon a mission to change the king heart
'Sire, whippin don't pay off
A lot more done you give a nigga one day off'
He took my advice, 'stead a yell again
Sir noticed that my input was accurate intelligence
That type meant ta stripe, kids
Even after he died, I still write raps like this

Who rotten 'em
All teacher and scholar try proceed me, believe me
I am all culture that you need be
And superior juice to abuse, I choose
Use words racist slave owner used to
Sandwich known crook, redbone hook too
Got his own land, which you're known look to
Not only ass wipes, swept side kick

Back in the day, we slow kiss
And man, I did search for an interior motive
'cause all your look is sound hype
I want to see if your worthwhile, settlin down type
God knows there's bigger
So, absorb to see if you gon sweat the next nigga
Oh help me make green light furriers
You know in life you can't race around with no worthless
So continue the sequel
You weighed in the scale and we lived as free people
Then disagree and erupted too
I don't feel my standards are being lived up to
So erection conquers, I ran out, went and had sex in Yonkers
God knows that flakin, jerkin her and not the replace

I thought you said you loved me, didn't he? (lay hey hey)

I swore you were dishonest, do you believe (lay hey hey)
I'll search this world forever, are you real? (lay hey hey)

Low is my time of honor, friend material and not that type of barner
So myself out of chump
Would the problems with having worth that type of jump
Commitment, rig, act cruddy, and regardless, move made and back studyin
Still screamin, thrown and elegance
Grown, don't play, growned intelligence
Fix what bother, and another
If speed's on made, once again, who gonna suffer? Stubborn fools came
The mule came over here wit a girl from the old school name
Though hit and all though back's about wit, memories
And that's about it, 'cause

[Slick Rick]
And uneasiness kept here, even after we made this big giant step here
Womanhood, somewhere in the basement
Slowin down again, so I'm lookin 'a replacement
Music poundin a slow jam
Wit a girl knowin and down wit the program
Although the honey aim style king
Wit a took broom and taimin the wild thing
Loud, uneasiness brought out
Still tried to shove my tongue down the bushy broad mouth
Speedin, chasin after vaccine
Tried to string along, but I didn't have the patience
Learned from cussin and confusion
Breakin Commandments wasn't a solution
Though a few minor clicks in relationship
Still time to fix things

Slick Rick,"Ladies, and gentlemen and lowlifes
It is with outstanding pleasure
That we are here to present tonight
 Rick, the Ruler! And MC  D
Doing their smash hit, 'Mona Lisa,'
You know, like the picture?
Anyway, I'd like to take this time out
To bow before his divine majesty
Oh your majesty
Hmm?
Can I kiss your hand?
Mm-hmm
(kisses his hand loudly)
Enough
Come your highness they await you

Well, it was one of those days -- not much to do
I was chillin downtown, with my old school crew
I went into a store -- to buy a slice of pizza
And bumped into a girl, her name was Mona -- what?
Mona Lisa (what?) *singing* Mona Lisa, so men made you
YouknowhatI'msayin? So I said, 'Excuse me, dear
My gosh, you look nice
Put away your money
I'll buy that slice!'
She said, 'Thanks - I'd rather a slice of you
I'm just kidding, but that's awfully nice of you'
The compliment showed she had a mind in her
And when I smiled (PING!) I almost blinded her
She said, 'Great Scott! Are you a thief?
Seems like you have a mouth full of gold teeth'
Ha-ha, hah! Had to find that funny
So I said, 'No child, I work hard for the money
And calling me a thief? Please! Don't even try it (Right!)
Sit down eat your slice of pizza, and be quiet'
She almost got cut short -- you know, scissors
She tried to disrespect WHO?! The Grand Wizard
Me! 'Well what's your name, son?'
'MC  D,' but not to be so harsh I said to Mona Li-hee
'I'm sorry and I know that's low class (uhh, yeah)
Please sit, and tell me a little about your past'
She said, 'Well I got courage, and I don't like porridge (uh-huh)
I've never been to college, but I've got crazy knowledge (uh-huh)
Over eighteen and my eyes are green (uh-huh)
I wear more gold than that man on A-Team (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Trim, slim, (yeah) and I'm also light skinned
Best believe Mona's a virgin'
A virgin?! Honey needed a slap
She tried to tell me she's a virgin -- with her yea wide gap
I said, 'It don't matter, see, I'm not picky (word)
Let me spell my name out for you, it's 
Are -- Ravishing
I -- Impress
See -- Courageousso careless
K -- for the Kangols which I've got
That I wear everyday and
Why -- why not?
To fight's not right that I recite and I'm
Quite polite like Walter Cronkite'
Well, just about then, Trevor my friend came in
He said, 'Hey Rick, don't you know playin with these snakes is a sin?!?'
He grabbed me by my shirt and pulled me right out the store
He said, 'I don't want to see you playin with these lowlifes no more
Now come along, we have a party to attend
With some real mature women and some more of her friends'
He hailed down a cab and he waited for a minute
And as the cab came, he thrusted me in it
And as we were leavin and drivin along
I could hear a melody as Mona sang a song

'If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry each time we meet
Walk on by walk on by
Foolish pride
That's all that I have left, so, let me hide
The pain and the hurt that you gave me
When you said goodbye
You walked on by '","Mona Lisa, Pt. 2"

Things you thought you'd learned again and again didn't fit well inside your head.

To heal, it will take more than time.

They don't know you like I do.
They never even tried to.

Lord, you're always there for me.
Without you I don't know what I would do.

All she knows now is how much things can change.
It's not her fault.
It's not her, no one is to blame.
It's just that regret has a way of taunting you.
I guess it's hard to hide the past,
The way she struggles to make it last.
I wanna share all I have with you.
Would it change a thing if I was with you?
A broken heart, too much has passed.
I hope someday that something lasts.
Her head hangs low, a tear is in her eye.
It's not the first time someone has made her cry.
Up goes a wall that no one can climb.
The only way in or out is through the heart.
Take your time, don't you rush a thing.
I'll be there waiting for you, never let you down again.
I wanna share all I have with you.
Would it change a thing if I was with you?

I haven't seen you in so long.
I'm never there when you need it most.
No matter what road you walk down on your own,
I'll be there.
You won't always have to be, alone tonight,
It's alright.
I know that I'm gone.
But here now,
Somehow,
I can feel you with me in my heart.
I need to see your face.
How has it been so long?
Out on the road you're stuck there at home.

And all that you would say.

Slick Shoes,"I thought about my life, and what I?e done this year.


Sometimes even to afraid to think of my fears.
A memory so young but not so long ago.
I thought about that night, it was almost Christmas time.

It seems like life just tries to pass me by.

If only I knew what to do right now.

Sometimes I seem so eager not to try.



I'll just have to wait for Christmas time.
Anxiety that thickens every day.
I woke up late today, the feeling came and went away.


So much wasted time, I?e just got to clear my mind.
I?l just fall asleep and dream of Christmas time.
Can? it always be like Christmas time in memory?




I wish I could know what the future holds for me.

I think life is like a gift opened everyday.
I wish I could know?but I don? know.

Angels composed it for us to dance to.
Our waltz is moonlight trembling with kisses,

Our love is Springtime filled with a promise,
Never to fade with the dawn,
And though you are gone

Slide Hampton,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song

Haunts my reverie

Slightly Stoopid,"I never thought too much on wealth
To let me keep it for myself,
But while the world's been turning upside-down
It's hard to talk about.
Another bottle off the shelf
With the hand that you've been dealt.
What's going wrong's been going on
It's time for you to scream and shout.

And I ain't no prophet
To cure some damn disease.
And would you help me anyway
If I was on my knees?
I'm going through my time of change
In my time of need,
And every little thing is gonna
Be all the same.

I never thought too much on wealth
To let me keep it for myself,
But while the world's been turning upside-down
It's hard to talk about.
Another bottle off the shelf
With the hand that you've been dealt.
What's going wrong's been going on
It's time for you to scream and shout.

I went to that corner store
To get myself a bottle of beer.
I was rollin with a friend of mine
When the liquor was a little more clear.
I always knew what I wanted from the start
Was a reason just to get out late.
Drinkin early was a dream for the summertime,
Music, and my seed, Mary Jane.

I never thought too much on wealth
To let me keep it for myself,
But while the world's been turning upside-down
It's hard to talk about.

If you never ask me why again

Is them Endo smoke better to be smoked up than juggle fifty


It's Philly love

Just drinkin' rum

And getting high

Listen to dub

Grip them pint

Get them buds

Spark the light

And get the girl


It's in your blood

Just drinkin' rum

And getting high

Listen to dub

Grip the pint

Get them buds

Spark that light

Fire it up


We flyin' high above the clouds again

Lookin' down from the clouds

At them holes that I see

You be comin' our direction

DEA, don't try, they intercept up, blazin' all of our weed

Instead of droppin bombs on Normandy

Fire one long artillery, smokin' up the enemy

Now we steppin' up an Irie beat

Take your shit, don't hurt, this is herb, yo we be puffin' them green

Now we live the Manu Chao way

King of the Congo, livin' in the jungle

Get hyptnotized like an Egyptian, whoa whoa whoa whoa


It's Philly love

Just drinkin' rum

And getting high

Listen to dub

Grip the pint

Get them buds

Spark the light

Fire it up


It's in the blood

Just drinkin' rum

And getting high

Listen to dub

Grip the pint

Get them buds

Spark the light

Fire it up

Baby I like it
Baby I like it when you move that way
I like it
Baby I like it when you move that way

Baby won't you tell me what it takes to be your man
Baby won't you tell me what it takes to understand
Now when your body's talkin' to me girl, 
You know what's on my mind
I wonder if you're the kinda girl who thinks would blow my mind
And if you're not pleased don't you worry, I don't discriminate
I said I like those kinda girls who put food up on my plate
But then you tell me that you want it girl, you know I want it too
Well, Wrap your legs right around my neck until my face turns blue
Because I like it in the mornin' time, girl
I like it late at night
I said I like those kinda girls who's pussy's really tight
So please girl don't keep me waiting so long
Please girl now don't keep me awaiting alone

(chorus)

(G love)
I smell the pussy but no pussy can I get
'Cause you keep your pussy hot just like your name was Boba Fett
I'm like hansolo gettin'a deep deep freeze
Nothin' I say can break the ice, not even pretty please
I keep it cool, respect you everyday of the week
But expect everyday of the week I wanna freak
Spread your legs a little wider I run up deep inside ya
She wrap me up and smoke me like my name was easy rider
Rider rider rider rider (2x)

(chorus)

So did you have to run, did you have to run, did ya did ya did ya have to run, did ya have to run away (2x)

Baby won't you tell me what it takes to be a man
Baby won't you tell me what it takes to understand
Now when your body's talkin to me girl, you know what's on my mind
I wonder if you're the kinda girl who thinks will blow my mind
So please girl now don't keep me waiting so long
Please girl now don't keep me waiting so long

Goin' up for nothin' would be better if there's somethin'

Just remember that the world is runnin'
By the hands of man who had no guns for violence

And awaken that what you slept to long
Cause twisted minds have lead you wrong

I just deliver the message, I don't need no thanks

In a world that's got us caught up in the wrong decision
By the ones we put in power gettin' richer and fatter
The rest of us around us think the one that all matters

Or it's us that gotta deal with the cost of your reason
It's us that gotta deal with the 'cause of your treason
Which way you runnin', pack your bags you know we comin'

Ay y'all
You see that one man's pleasure can be the next man's sorrow
No such thing as loyalty, no good examples to follow
All we hearin' is time to fix the distortion
Nothin' but death and disease and epidemic proportions

The order of the day is hate and grieves
Time to take the lead supply the basic needs
And either deal with it or you could deny it

From the lowest comes the highest

Slightly Stoopid,"Ya know that lovin' ain't enough to make the world go round.
You know that lovin' ain't enough to make the world renowned.
It's just enough to make you move and want to feel the ground.
When you're down and you're out and you know
Because we're holding on to lovin'.
The type of feeling that make you want to implode
Or like a time bomb ticking explode.
Or it's a feeling that you wanted to know,
About the world how does it know,
Because we're holding on to lovin'
Because we're holding on to lovin'.
Yeah,

Yeah aye,
Using caution when I'm approaching,
Got to obtain perfection.
Using art to act as a cushion,
Which measures my main obsession.
My inner direction came into possession,
Dressed as positive vides.
There is never a question I feel like I'm blessed,
To just be part of the pride.
The feeling is hard to describe,
Call it the faith or call it the drive.
No matter the space or size,
This magic will happen in front of your eyes.
And whether you're dead or alive,
Late or way ahead of your time,
You do possess the power to change,
The negative forces that enter your mind.
See love is a seed as soon as it feeds
On human emotion and passion.
Someone who can feel when something is real,
And not just a limited caption.
We live in a primitive fashion,
Logic is distant we give in to passion.
And we can get lost and thrown off course,
And keep it, prevent it from crashing.
I know what your asking,
What is the purpose and are my efforts worthless?
Can it be reached if I can dig deeper,
Or am I just scratching the surface?
Well I was just thinking of ways,
Of singing the meaning and making the phrase.
Because trying to personify love,
Is harder than writing with ink on a page.",Just Thinking

When I’m in peace and serenity, my mother’s suicide comes and breaks it all
And Daddy left home, now I’m alone
Right here and...

Smiling, laughing, you just try to hide your whole life
Laughing and smiling, you just try to feel fine
And try to…

To take a new way, but I will stay in my fairytale
Nothing on my shoulders
I’m not going to cry for us
I don’t want to apologize
You can go ahead, that’s right
You can go ahead, that’s right
You can go ahead, that’s right
You can go ahead, that’s right

Anything you want me to, I'd do it all for you
I'm sorry 'cause I broke you down
Made you cry, girl, I apologize

Started throwing out your things to erase the memory
But it didn't work at all
Seeing our pictures in the frame, it's driving me insane
When I picked up the phone and call

And I just won't accept this goodbye
I know I got one shot but girl, you mean a lot to me

Slim,"[Verse 1: Slim]
Tell me why you're here tonight
Are you looking for someone to do you right
I see you standing by yourself
And I heard you're stepping for somebody else
Came up to you
So I approached you on the wall
I Started off by saying beautiful
And then I saw
That you already had a man
Cause I noticed the ring on your hand

[Bridge: Slim]
So I thought to myself slow it down, cause I don't want it to get the best of me
But I'm starting to get closer now, cause I'm feeling that this might be destiny
And I'm dancing with you although its wrong
And I cant help but notice you're feeling it
And there's really no use holding out, cause I know its that good love you need
I can give it to you baby

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie]
If its good love you need, I give good lovin'
How its supposed to be, all night and it wont slow down
Its good love you need, I give good loving'
How its supposed to be, all night and it wont slow down

[Verse 2]
Imagine if you came with me, and imagine all the things that we can do
Me and you can make it work so easily, baby I can see it in the way you move
The way you move
I get it from the way you dip, from the way you're biting on your bottom lip
I know you want it
Cause even though you got a man, you're still taking me by the hand

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
I got that good love
You ain't heard of me by now, well you should've
What you been under a rock or you're just outta touch
I know you work, go to school, and don't get out as much
So if you let me baby, I'ma let you whats good
A TV with HD wouldn't show as good 
I got that fogging up the windows in the back of Jeeps
Yeah I wake that thing up, and put it back to sleep
You put it back to sleep? That's what I said right?
They do it wrong baby come get your head right
And I think everybody know what Biggie said right?
If its right is on tonight like headlights
I don't slow down, not even for red lights
You cant stop this G double O D
We can both try to fight it like ??
But you need this Loso, in case you didn't know so
Slim take us outta here

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Ryan Leslie]
Now I'm rolling down my tinted window
Is you coming or staying, I see you think about it girlfriend just surrender
You got a chance to make the right choice
I'm intelligent, got my money right, plus I got a nice voice
I can give you the right touch, the right place
You don't really need to be wifed up, hes lightweight
I wrote the right hook, and got you knocked out
I take you shopping, get iced up and rocked out
I know you like the picture, I'ma paint it for real
By the way I put it down slowly when I'm rolling with ya
They'll be looking for us, but well be under covers
On the journey from perfect strangers to secret lovers
Tell me all your stories, I'ma tell you mines
Ill even lie to you, tell you Ill leave the game behind
So you can feel good, but you know what it is
I'm only tryin' to get in and handle my business

[Chorus]

[Slim & Ryan Leslie]
Slow down, slow down, and it wont slow down [Repeat: x3]
Slow down, and it wont slow down

How its supposed to be, and it wont slow down
Its good love you need, I give good loving
How its supposed to be, all night and it wont slow down",Good Lovin'

A man could ever travel when he's down
And you curse the never ending road before you
When you think you'll never make it into town

But you meet a friend or two along the highway

By the campfire at night we'll hear the wild dingoes call
But there's-a nothing so lonesome, morbid or drear
Than to stand in the bar of a pub with no beer

Now the publican's anxious for the quota to come
And there's a far away look on the face of the bum
The maid's gone all cranky and the cook's acting queer
Oh what a terrible place is a pub with no beer

Then the stockman rides up with his dry dusty throat
He breasts up to the bar and pulls a wad from his coat
But the smile on his face quickly turns to a sneer
As the barman says sadly the pub's got no beer

Then the swaggie comes in smothered in dust and flies
He throws down his roll and rubs the sweat from his eyes
But when he is told, he says what's this I hear
I've trudged fifty flamin' miles to a pub with no beer

Now there's a dog on the v'randa, for his master he waits
But the boss is inside drinking wine with his mates
He hurries for cover and he cringes in fear
It's no place for a dog 'round a pub with no beer

And old Billy the blacksmith, the first time in his life
Why he's gone home cold sober to his darling wife
He walks in the kitchen, she says you're early Bill dear
But then he breaks down and tells her the pub's got no beer

Oh it's hard to believe that there's customers still
But the money's still tinkling in the old ancient till
The wine buffs are happy and I know they're sincere
When they say they don't care if the pub's got no beer

Slim Dusty,"Trumby was a ringer
A good one too at that
He could rake and ride a twister
Throw a rope and fancy plait
He could count a line a saddle
A man lost in the night
Trumby was a good boy but he couldn't read or write

Trumby was dependable
He never took to beer
The boss admired him so much
One day made him overseer
It never went to Trumby's head
He didn't boast or skite
Trumby was a good boy but he couldn't read or write.

The drought was on the country
The grass in short supply
The tanks were getting lower and the water holes near dry
Cattle started dying
And relief was not insight
To estimate the losses Trumby couldn't read or write.

He rode around the station pulling cattle from the bog
To save them being torn apart by eagles crows and dogs
He saw a notice on a tree 
It wasn't there last night
Trumby tried to understand but he couldn't read or write.

On bended knee down in the mud
Trumby had a drink
Swung the reigns and to his horse said ""We go home I think""
""Tell 'im boss about the sign, 'im read 'im good alright""
""One day boss's missus teach 'im Trumby read and write""

Well concern was felt for Trumby
He hadn't used his bed
Next day beside that muddy hole they found the ringer dead
And a piece of tin tied to a tree then caught the boss's eye
He read the words of 'Poison Here'
And signed by Dogger Bry

Now the stock had never used that hole along that stony creek
And Trumby's bag was empty
It has frayed and sprung a leak
The dogs were there in hundreds 
And the dogger in his plight
Told the boss he never knew poor Trumby couldn't read or write

Now Trumby was a ringer
As solid as a post
His skin was black but his heart was white and that's what mattered most
Sometimes I think how sad it is in this world with all its might
That a man like Trumby met his death because he couldn't read or write.

Couldn't read or write

And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
Stuck at Folsom Prison, time keep draggin' on
And the train keep a rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was a baby, my mama told me
""Son, always be a good boy and don't ever play with gun""
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die
When I hear the train a comin' I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folk eatin' in that fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' whiskey and smokin' big cigars
I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free
But those people keep on movin' and that's what tortures me

Well, if they free me from this prison and the railroad train is mine
I'd move it on little farther down the line
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I gonna stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle, oh, blow, blow my blues away

Understand I get around, and can't be held down
Fuck what I did last night, let's have fun now
I want a brown dime piece, that can roll a sweet
That's a lady in the streets, but a freak in the sheets

[Chorus:]

Put my hand on the gas, drop my ass low
Slide on fast, then we go slow
Blaze up the endo, raise up the window
That's the way thugs, and gangstas roll

Who say hood rats ain't fine, they done lost they mind
On a scale of one to ten, I done seen plenty nines

I like em high class with ass, Gucci down to the ground
When she pass, she make the whole crowd turn around

Real deal Cedric Hill, trying to make a mill
Give a woman ecstasy, without taking a pill

I want a gal caramel, that smell like Shanel
The kind of female, you put in your V-12

Yellow bones race up, but I reverse on dark
They like Free from BET's, 106 & Park

White, light skinned or dark, don't hate on the race
If she cute with a body, then she in the right place, come on

And this song's to let you know, be real about your do'

Telling me, E.S.G. let me do a story on your life
To show the world how you emerge, to splurge your ice

Fat checks we cash em, shut em down to mash em, huh

Living laid in the shade, all dues been paid
To tell the truth we got it made, something hatas can't fade
Riding thick like a parade, shutting all blocks down

The double G for ghetto gold, getting green and go-getter

Bunch of dime pieces in thongs, all on the dance flo'
Ain't no rules we all grown, baby anything go

I got spots in every hot spot, from L.A. to Dallas
You can't miss me, it's my party you can't diss me
Turn off all your clocks people, let's make history
We gon drank till we faint, smoke till we choke

You in the lot, trying to pop it your hoop on hubs
You and your group at the club, trying to shoot your slugs
You think a nigga won't box you, or shoot your mug

I just came here to party baby, drank and roam blocks
Get a thicky thick chick, and get a quick dome shot
Got a sick chrome glock, and it cough at niggaz
I came here to fuck with women, I talk to niggaz

I'm here often nigga (doing what), buying the bar
Getting crunk with my click, might be eyeing a star
I see white eyeing a bar, while I sip my Belve
Walked over (grabbed her hand), and with her lips she tells me

(get thoed) hell yeah boo, I'm one of the ones
So I pull her close to me, hands under her buns
But it's one thing about her, I just got to know
If she cutting tonight shorty, then I got to go

Looking for a chickenhead, bopper to bop
Twenty inches spinning slow, as I crawl in the lot
Gold diggers flag me down, trying to get me to stop

But oh no, a nigga recognized disguise
I looked past that thick ass, and them big ol' thighs
I'm A G, I peep game constantly
So tell me what the fuck, do you want from me

I'm at the bar, taking shots to the head
Trying to find a yellow bone, that give shots to the head
I see a fine looking dime, and she rocking some red
Spit a line and she mine, while she drop in my bed

Your misses trying to get a Boss, kisses and hugs
But your misses get nothing, but diss and mugs

I don't give dick to chicks, that give it up to scrubs
Trying to find the finest bitch, up in the club
Make her up that thing, get in her ear
And fill her up, with game

Ten times out of ten, I'ma cut that thang
Got the broad giving up the brain, like it ain't nothing mayn
I'm a P-I-M-P, simple to me
And talk hoes out they clothes, so easily

And I'm bout to be, a platinum star

(*scratching*)",In da Club
Slim Thug,"*Talking In The Background*

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

You look at the sun
And you see a light
You look into my eyes
Then you'll find me mind!

Yeaaaaaaaaaaah hey!
You make me crazy!!

Oh it's so cold
When rain falls
Got stupid brain
When I'm on da train
I was stupid child
And I'm still stupid now
My head hit da ball
And da ball hit da ground

Yeaaaaaaaaaaah hey!
You make me crazy!!

Get up I'm ready !
Get up there!
Cum on alone!
Get up won't you get up and down?
Stop!

Slim Thug,"My life
My life, really feelin hard times

Lookin' out my window, holdin' my weapon like Malcolm X and
And it seems I'm over-stressin', feelin' like hatin' is your profession
And I know a couple Texans that got killed for over-reppin'
So I never be oversteppin' boundaries bounded to my weapon
When they ask me how I'm doin, I just tell 'em ""I'm doin' super""
I got a date with Destiny, allow me to introduce ya
Her little sister Fate told me I'm gon' be the future
And legacy's everything to a Martin Luther King Koopa
This recession is so pathetic, got me feelin' like I'm athletic
And success tryna get away from me and I ain't tryna let it
When they told that Pimp was gone, my reply was ""I don't get it""
And I'm still havin trouble believin' it happened the way they said it
Had to cut some partners off, swear to y'all it ain't my fault
I've been grown since I was seven and I was born to be a boss
But I know there's a bunch of haters tryna see me take a loss
So I be sleepin' with one eye open and put cameras in my vault
I've been thinkin' and gettin' deep and they tryna tell I been preachin'
But I know that they can't see how much of the world that I be reachin'
So stop reachin, stop leachin, I'm a fade 'em out like bleach and
In the spots where they can't get out to is the spots I visit frequent
Europe to UK and Germany, travellin' currently
Made so much in millions that I could cash out in eternity
Accustomed to hittin' customs with that duffle full of currency
When God created hustle, looked at the world and he inserted me, Koopa

[Chorus: x4]
I'm just livin' my life, so cold
In the streets so I'm takin' it slow

Uh, yeah
I'll tell you my story, I only speak the truth homie

It a terrible situation, throwed on the curb within the hands of time
But since I'm blistery breathing I guess a nigga livin' fine
I live a life that's filled with dramatistic people cryin'
And since the hood depend on me, they'll never lose a hand of mine (I gotcha)
I'm paralysis when it come to the good times, I'm used to the pain
Feelin' like a bum under the bridge, I'm so used to the rain
Anything I do is from the heart so it reflect my name
Forgive me for my sins father, I feel like I'm goin' insane
Media criticizing me for checking niggas, fuck it, oh well
I just wasn't raised a little pussy disrespected nigga
I'm tryna live on my own by the ways of a gangster
So every time I leave out I pray so I'm prayin' for a gangster
It's bad enough the world we livin in all about money
Since we runnin' out I choose to believe it ain't nothin funny
I've been stabbed in my back so much I deal with it
I'm tryna kick it with my life before heaven come chill with it

[Chorus: x4]

Last year was a hard one but life goes on
Thinkin' bout my nigga Pimp while I write this song
And the list goes on, all my niggas is gone
I'm tired of hearin' bad news, scared to pick up my phone
Got a call, my nigga Eddy died from Acres home
Just seen him at my video shoot, now that shit wrong
Kelvo, Arborea, even my girl Shantz
I just heard word she got stabbed to death today
Dear Lord, I pray that you take away the pain
From their family and their friends, please help us change
Still warm my niggas sleep dog, stessle and stank
My girl Dee Dee, they got me pourin' out my drank
It's fucked up, all my friends is dead or in the pen
Seem like soon as your life begin it's beginning to end
I'm frustrated, but you gotta smile, your time is dated
You never know when showin' your love might be related, ha ha

[Chorus: x4]",My Life
Slim Thug,"They said no when I told them that I'd find a way to get to the top
They didn't know that eventually I'd be the one to worry about
When someone would mention me, they always tried to say I would flop
But this the sound of revenge

Yea
On the path to find out who's true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you feel like you can't even trust you
Then you can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
Cause that's really the only person that can judge you
Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do
Shouldn't do and must do
But when you got that glow
Nobody else's words can really budge you

Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win
Sometime it sound like :gunshot: 
Is what it coulda been
When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in
But ya change that meanin' up and success is what it is in the end
And instead of worryin' about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been
Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Well say it again
Keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Screw it then
Know what I'm sayin?

If you're waitin' for me to fail, your time is runnin' out on that clock
I'm runnin' to the finish yea, when I get there I ain't gonna stop
Success is what I couldn't have, but now I tell em look what I got
It's the sound of revenge",Outro

Some of these hoes, got class and respect
But most of these hoes, trying to cash them a check
Bottom line, all about the Benjamin's
She'll sleep with ya quick, if you drop dividends
And it's a lot of cake, niggaz complying
Giving hoes all they cash, cause these bitches are fine
Fool last motherfucker, look at the picture
If you was broke with no hope, would this chick be with ya
Hell naw, I can answer that
She'll sleep with ya partna, if she think he got stacks
And that's a fact, cause I done seen it with my own fucking eyes
Hoes trying to play they role, while getting boned 'tween the thighs
For real, cause all boppers the same
Quick to hop on ya dick, cause you got you some change

And if you ask about the next man bitch, I can't tell ya nuttin'
And while you half-sleep in the morning, waking up on the phone

And my bitch know when I'm calling, I'm calling to hit
I keep a dime shotgun, while I'm making my runs
I bless 'em with my presence, never ever my funds
I got broads that's ghetto, broads that's seditty
But if the broad with me, then the broad is pretty
With big ass and titties, on the scale a dime
But if I'm out of time, I might settle for a nine
I love money, pussy and sticky green
I keep a all star team, that love to lick me clean
I know they want me for my green, I'ma let 'em stay wanting
At the mall they bags empty, and the Boss stay flaunting
And I do it, with a straight face
And if the chick jump fly, then the chick get replaced

I need a dime like J-Lo, Vivica Fox
Put ice in her life, and some nice invisible rocks
Kyleon, the type that never like trashy chicks
No strippers just Moet sippers, classy chicks
The kind, that I can't let walk pass me chick
Do anything for her, as long as she ask me chick
Like flashy shit, DG Prada and Gucci clothes
And Victoria Secret silk panties, covers and ooh she knows
She never hang with movie hoes, dig dealers and X popping
She's not a bopper, that say she hop out of Lex droppers
She my sex doctor, good love she go hard in bed
Go down below my waist with her lips, and harden my head
I call her the warden in bed, she keep me on lock
Not only her, it's my game she keep me on top
A bad broad, she just might keep me on bops
But she love for daddy to hustle, that's why she keep me on blocks
That's why I love her mayn, uh

I need a dime broad, top of the line broad
A fine broad, fuck up a nigga mind broad

And when it's time to get freaky, she a nasty chick)
I need a play girl, down around the way girl
More than okay girl, help me get my pay girl

That's down to ride, but never in some gangsta shit)

Stand tall like a model, shaped like a Coke bottle
Smile, will make the hardest thug heart feel hollow

Richie Rich himself, couldn't get in my bitch
She not impressed by cash, boo got her own stash
Boo got her own house, bought her own S Class
Independent lady, still up for the babies
Could be the house wife or the Boss type, it's crazy
My boo go to church, three days a week
My boo put God first, everyday she see
She never dug, hanging out in the club
By ten she tucked in, waiting on Thug
Never hating on Thug, or what Thug do
Cause Thug would be a fool, if Thug don't stay tru to my boo

Get all that you can get, just release me baby

Usually lie to hoes, bout buying 'em Prada clothes
If I do soon as they trip, they strip up out of those
Back to the sto' refund time, cause that's just how it goes
Now you know, I fuck 'em and leave 'em duck 'em and weave em
Listen to they sad stories, never fucking believe em

[Kyleon]
Sometimes I ask myself, what is life like
What would I be without this rap, without a mic life
Or will I die young, like my partna Mike like
Won't get to see my girl grow, and see what a wife's like
But my life's alright, no I ain't finished yet
I just got started, I ain't ready to end it yet
I'm 24 years old, I ain't even beginned it yet
I just started having money, I ain't got a chance to spend it yet
I want to be a millionaire, but I'm losing my life line
My ticket out this ghetto, is for me to write rhymes
I know I can get this money, if I write rhymes
Opportunity knocked for me, at the right time
Cause I was losing hope, getting sick of this bullshit
Losing my faith, not listening to preachers and bull pits
God pulled my card quick, nope no more pain mayn
Sunshine for now, no more rain mayn

[Slim Thug]
I grew up around a bunch of gang bangers, and caine slangers
Stayed in danger, cause I played with strangers
Was born and raised by gangstas, taught by the hood
Proud of my block, everyday fought for the hood
Stand up kid, ain't too many did what I did
Saw half the shit I saw, or lived like I lived
When my mama went to work, my brother went to work
In the kitchen, pyrex shifting till it hurt
I watched him grind, fascinated by the cash
Patiently waiting, for my time to mash
Never tagged along, see I had my own gang
We had our own ideas, on how to get this change
We did our own thang, small time hustling
Some young niggaz, never asking for nothing
It ain't take us long, to peep what's going on
The broke niggaz was weak, while the rich was strong we got it on

[Lil Mel]
By all means I had to get it, I'm a hustler black
This rap thing what I dreamed, don't want to fuck with crack
But damn, being broke I can't fuck with that
And being po' ain't what I hoped, so I hustled stack
Have nuts have money, that's the code in these streets
And when my money got low, I was holding the heat
I'm just a young nigga living, trying to sip and ball
And even though these streets wet, I can't slip and fall
I ran with killas pull triggas, up out they stacks fo'
And if they broke, they hitting your back do' with the Mackno
Fuck worrying bout haters, cause that'll freeze em up
That's what the heat is for, guaranteed to heat em up
These streets bad and yeah lil' daddy, from has-fect
A young nigga could lose his life, over a glass set
It'll take a cell in a jail, for us to do some mad thinking
That's how it is that's how it go, I know it's sad ain't it

[Chris Ward]
You gotta know, that you can't take your life for granted
Cause it's a loaded game, out here on this lifeless planet
Smoke till my eyes get slanted, just to focus better
Thinking over pass times, when I wrote this letter
I just hope it gets better, for the future's sake
Trying not to make the mistakes, that I use to make
Been out in the streets, since the age of 17
And witnessed all type of bullshit, most have never seen
Damn near homeless, I slept on flo's slept in cars
Been through all kind of battles, nigga just check my scars
My backgrounds my resume, and my repitwa
That's why I walk the way I talk nigga, and wreck this hard
Please God, no more rainy days just sunshine
Cause me and my homies tired, of ducking one times
If I could I promise, I will put this gun down
But how can I, when I'm a soldier on the frontline",It's So
Slim Thug,"Close your lips and open your ears, for a change
You just might, learn some thangs
I don't understand your plan, let me get this right
You broke, but you grinding all day and night

You on the block pushing caine, with Jordan's and a chain
I know, everybody want to have nice things
But man, you must think the dope game is a game
Fuck around and have yourself, catching a chain

Better stash you some cash, for a rainy day man
Cause only God knows, what tomorrow bring
Better listen, I'm trying to stop a lot of sorrow and pain
'Cause falling on your ass, is a horrible thing

You better listen, I talk too shit too raw explain
Better learn from the mistakes, of the Outlaw gang
I been there done that, fought that won that
Lost that and got it right back, you better listen

[Chorus: x2]
Quit being hard headed (yeah I hear you mayn)
Open your ears and just listen (yeah I hear you mayn)
Get off your ass and do something (yeah I hear you mayn)

It's more than one way out here, to get that do'
It don't take a rocket scientist, to get that bro
You can get that fast, get that slow
Hit licks with that grass, with that blow

Or with that pads, spit that flow
Or gamble with it, try to get back mo'
Uh-uh not me, I refuse to lose
You either got it or you don't, and I refuse to choose

And candy blue's I cruise, cause if I snooze I lose
And if I get out there bad, I just use my tools
My mind and muscle, that helps me grind and hustle
If it wasn't for this rap, I'd try to find a hustle

Why niggers sitting on they behind, steady trying to hustle
24/7-3/65, my time to hustle
I'd be a dealer out here, I got dimes and shuffles
Kyleon, is what really defines the hustle, just listen mayn

[Chorus: x2]

You need to quit talking so much, for a minute and hush
Stop trying to throw down boy, why you in such a rush
You play the game, as if you got a royal flush
But if you don't cool off, you just might get touched

I grind against the grain, and your brain like a crush
'Cause for me to get mine, is a plus and a must
But listen, hustling ain't for everybody
Especially if you ain't got the heart, and you's a scary body

Oh but I know, you don't hear me boy
It's goin' take something bad to happen, for you to feel me boy
But I'm so sick and tired, of teaching and preaching
You ain't even meet me half way, it's like I'm the only one that's reaching

While you keep leaching, you goin' find yourself smashed
Pumped up, wrecked and crashed
You must of forgot my nigger, your future's my past
You oughtta listen, 'fore you wind up on your ass

[Chorus: x2]

On how, I got this cash
I sold zones bled mics, moved rocks and hash
I click pro long, had to get on these blocks and mash
You want your do' long, try to hit these blocks and mash

Be careful though, you got niggers that watch your stash
And the second you slip get off his hip, goin' pop your ass
Get a connect cop a Tech, take your prize in the dash
We balling now, hit the lot put your ride on glass

You hard headed not heated, when you ride on glass
Left it at home, but you need it when you ride on glass
Knocked off your feet you looking weak, your boys slide on past
Had a high class bitch, now you collide with trash

Now you the hood rat plumber, pushing hood rat lil' mama
Laid up with the slut, and caught the high five from her
Now you lying like a plumber, sick broke and in drama
Should of listened",Listen

Got a million worth of cars, bought a million dollar house
From making words rhyme out my million dollar mouth

I'm so flashy, rims so glassy
Pull the dropper out, we gon show them boys nasty

Hood rats harrass me, I don't want the drama
They wanna get put up so they could be me baby mama

And throw them vogues and grills on candy automobiles

I'm still tipping on vogues, closing candy blue doors
From the old caddy coupe to the new blue Rolls
I'm from the hood living good, so I'm pimping

Slim Thug,"That's right

I went from ashy to classy, to classic
Quarter million dollar car, you can't pass me
Haters can you hear me now, I can barely hear you
Mother fuckers too far in my rearview

I went from ashy to classy, to classic
Quarter million dollar car, you can't pass me
Haters can you see me now, a nigga pocket so swoll
They can't stand to see a young nigga home, ballin' outta control

Started out a little young nigga, 'bout 15
Tryin' to figure out ways to get big green
Had dreams of rock gleams, top down on the old school
'Cause the hustla's ridin' clean looked so cool

You know the rules, I got in where I fit in
Why not hit the block, all my other brothers did it
Had to get out there and get it on my own
'Cause when you turn 16, nowadays you grown

Mama did her best, 'cause I never missed a meal
But I'm tired of takin' money that shit needed for bills, you feel me?
I'm tryin' to take a little weight up off her back
So I'm takin' up the slack, thanks to feens wantin' crack

A 50 pack, to a half, to a whole
To be 15 nigga, my pockets on swoll', huh
I'm finally 'bout to get my chance to go pro
And let the city know Slim thug gettin' dough

I went from ashy to classy, to classic
Quarter million dollar car, you can't pass me
Haters can you hear me now, I can barely hear you
Mother fuckers too far in my rearview

I went from ashy to classy, to classic
Quarter million dollar car, you can't pass me
Haters can you see me now, a nigga pocket so swoll
They can't stand to see a young nigga home, ballin' outta control

Now I'm the one ridin' clean, just made 17
But I ain't' satisfied with the cash the block bring
And them law snatchin' niggas off the block every night
'Cause boys treatin' this shit 'cause it's a normal 9 to 5

Instead of trying to put their paper in a row
These niggas on the block hustlin' till they get caught
But a, my mama didn't ain't no fool
I had to chill for a minute and just focus on school

And if I wasn't in the hall gettin' ho's
I was chillin' wit' my niggas spittin' flows
Next thing you know I'm at the club doin' shows
And gettin' bank rolls when I step through the doors

My pussy rate at an all-time high
And ain't too much shit that I want I can't buy
I'm livin' good, everyday stay fly
I guess that's why the niggas in the hood say hi

I went from ashy to classy, to classic
Quarter million dollar car, you can't pass me
Haters can you hear me now, I can barely hear you
Mother fuckers too far in my rearview

I went from ashy to classy, to classic
Quarter million dollar car, you can't pass me
Haters can you see me now, a nigga pocket so swoll
They can't stand to see a young nigga home, ballin' outta control

Nowadays I'm a made man
And word is Slim Thug is a very well paid man
I'm Ray Banned up, top down, mashing
Lookin' in the rearview at the haters that I'm passin'

So please stop with them questions you askin'
I'm a hustla, I'ma stay smashing
Quarter million dollar cars, I'm livin' like a star
VIP with the bar, players buyin' out the bar

And even though a nigga didn't shoot hoops
I still found ways to make NBA loot
A young nigga got his pockets on swoll'
They can't stand to see a young nigga home, ballin' outta control

I went from ashy to classy, to classic
Quarter million dollar car, you can't pass me
Haters can you hear me now, I can barely hear you
Mother fuckers too far in my rearview

I went from ashy to classy, to classic
Quarter million dollar car, you can't pass me
Haters can you see me now, a nigga pocket so swoll
They can't stand to see a young nigga home, ballin' outta control

My nigga use to ride with me (yep), get high with me (yep)
And fly with me (yep), slice them pies with me (yep)
Spray them guys for me (yep), and die for me (yep)
But (damn fool), why this way

I'm still not over my nigga Stessa, Stank you still missed
My life was getting a lot better, until I ran into this
A tragedy a gangsta, my nigga had to be
Lil' chief don't know what's going on, and shit that's sad to see
Cortiana a star, we gon watch over her man
Courtney, she kinda know but she don't really understand
What's going on, I-Pop and Heaven at home
My nigga kept his family first, so I know where he gone
He left Corn with a lot to look after, he can take it
Not from your mother but we your brothers, so I know you gon make it
You got Sha you got Chad, you got Troy you got me
Ray, Ed, Mo, Shannon and Kenny G
We your family nigga, so wipe the tears from your eyes
Stay focused get your paper, and stay on the rise
You a hustler, and a jacker can't take that
Your brother Sleep gone, cause haters hate my nigga

My nigga use to ride with me (yep), get high with me (yep)
And fly with me (yep), slice them pies with me (yep)
Spray them guys for me (yep), and die for me (yep)
But (damn fool), why this way

We had to wait crying, our dog a victim of a hate crime
These haters hate, cause he shined at all times
Seeing the way Sleep Dog ball, made a nigga chase paper
Remember the day you gave me your chain, at my show at The Maker
Get your shine on youngster, we love to see that
When I put candy on the Excursion, he loved to see that
We showed up, Sleep part of the reason I blowed up
When them haters saw how hard we ball, they fold up
He lived life to the fullest, everything to the extreme
Done so much, I think my nigga ran out of dreams
From cars clothes to hoes, competition is none
We had fun, like Nelly say we number one
I know Sha gon hold your name, and keep the click on game
Now I don't like to ride solo, I stay with a gang

He's from Texas
Now son you've been doin' it real big for awhile
But please, tell us what's the secret to your success?

I'm a bonafide hustla
Used to have to bust bricks down in half
In order to see the cash
That's in the past
Niggas outta see the stash
Went straight to the bentley
Skilled, the S-class
I was a star before I signed autographs
This the beginning, y'all ain't seen my last
When I call myself a hustla,
I ain't talking about moving rocks
I'm talkin' bout them 9's and them aks and them glocks
When y'all was on the corner
Out there runnin' from them cops
I was out there sellin' all them local crack spots
Boyz in blue and we creep deep
Motherfuckin' police
We make the rules in the streets nigga

I feel you
I feel you
Now we talk about the style of Texas
NOw many seem to think cause you got that Texas style
That's gonna limit your success
Tell us what you think about that

I'm an H-town nigga

Stay out my way
Cause nigga I'm not for play
Ya niggas say you G's

He's from H-town
But he don't stay where I stay
I'm from the land of the killers
He don't lay where I lay
So get it right motherfuckers
Don't try to put me in the same shoes as them suckers
There's a real thick line between rhymers and some hustlas
Them niggas ain't no gangstas,
Them niggas is some bustas

Okay talk to 'em
I see you here with all these diamonds, all these chains
You drivin' around in bentley's
But I don't ever see you with any security,
Please, what's the word on that

Pistol grip pump in my lap at all times
They be checkin' other fools, but they ain't checkin' mine
You run up tryin' you gon' be lyin' down dyin'
When you hear that clock clock sound comin' out of the iron
I ain't no fuckin' punk, I suggest you niggas chill
Cause if I pop this trunk, then somebody gon' get killed
This ain't no rap act, my nigga I'm really real
Go on run your ass up, and watch me stop you with the steel
Niggas must be on peel, cause it's evident they
Think the boss went soft cause I got a record deal
I do this rap shit cause makin' hits pay my bills
And I could give a fuck what you other suckers feel

Slim Thug,"I love ya Miss Mary
I love ya Miss Mary
I love ya Miss Mary
This ain't a love song
This a thug song

I'm so in love with you Miss Mary (Miss Mary!)
I can't picture my life without you cause it gets scary (Gets scary!)
When I'm down I need you around in a hurry (In a hurry!)
And calm me down from my hard times and my worries (Miss Mary!)
I'll hold you close to me late at night
Face to face we meet and greet and everythangs iight
Ya nothing less then a dime when you in my sight
And through the dark days you know how to bring the light
I remember the first time I kissed ya
My first experience with love is when I finally hit ya
And I'm a thug but fuck it I ain't gon lie I miss ya
I wanna spend everyday of the rest of my life with ya
We break up to make up but we can't stay apart (No!)
It feel like forever when we spend a day apart (Fa show!)
So begging you to come back as I play my part (Oh!)
It's a shame how you just had your way with my heart
I love ya Miss Mary

And when we out in crowds, I still hold you like I'm proud
You make me feel like I'm in heavin walking on clouds
You stay fresh new tags I keep you with new bags
You make a nigga feel good I can't help but brag
And I know my so called friends trinna hit you whyle I'm gone
Play with you whyle I'm gone, split you whyle I'm gone
But you always stay faithfull cause this is ya home
And you know your man, I never treat you wrong
And my moms gets pissed off when I bring you around
She always hit us with, "" Ya'll get up out my house right now! ""
If she only knew how I was shacked up back when I was a kid
And how late nights I was sneaky went in and out of the crib
To my nose your scent is just as sweet as a rose
I wasn't impressed by them others so you the one I chose
To roll with, settle down and go with
I love you Miss Mary and I show it and make sure she knows it

You take away all my bad times
Put a smile on my face through my sad times
Been down with me way before I had shine
I feel like I owe you half the cash from my rhymes
(I wasn't gonna talk about this here man but uhhh)
I used to abuse ya and try to missuse ya
We exchanged a bunch of blows back when I was a loser
You used to trip when I sang won't no more seeds
I had enough stress on my life please believe
I lost a lot of paper when I moved you to Philly
Broke you off a bunch of green you had me trippin' but still we
Maintained to stick together through the ups and downs
And when I ain't have nobody else, you was around
It all worked out in the end you payed me back times ten
When I was broke on my ass you gave me cash to spend
And hit that highway with the pack of gin
And put me on my feet with the stacks of benze (Miss Mary)
I want you in my life 'till death do us part (Miss Mary)
Cause you've been down with a nigga from the start (Miss Mary)
You're the only thing that can claim my heart
Miss Mary Jane you deserve more fame for your art",Miss Mary

It's goin' down, and you know we bout to climb
All these ballers representin' that damn H-Town

Blaze up the indo, light the chocolate tye
Sittin' on South Race screens, ballin' out the sky
Hoes diss that ass cause they want to buy me Ralph Lauren
Cause big 'o 19's look lovely on the foreign
I ain't borrowing, the baddest, the V-12 is the baddest
A rhymin' afterattics gave me superstar status
Longers get my list, haters got me pissed
I used to sell rocks, now they all on my wrist
Feel this before yourself, step and get in this
The playa, the pimp, young thug and a menace
Pretendness is endless, and crank up confusion
Yo sweet cal is used in knockin' out Houston

And hit me on the beep if you need thirtysix
Quickly, we're the grands of high rexis
I'll make you mighty reckless to run up on the Lexus
It's still this game from a Southern gangbanger
No anger to a stranger, but it's one up in the chamber
Of the blared straight glock cause haters come in flocks
It don't face born and raised on the 8100 block of Herschelwood
And the point is understood
We keep it all good in this crack-controlled hood
It ain't too late to set it straight, real players don't hate
Push weight and keep fate and the money that I make I'ma break
500 mean gold, tapes sold, story told, from the North to South Pole
21 years old, want to bone, won't drown

You and me, baby, let's get a room for the hour
Get high as a tower, bust a nut and hit the showers
You gone with the wind, after while it's on again
This time bring a friend, a couple corners we gone bend

Once I split it then I hit it, you in love, go'on admit it

Slim Thug,"So incredible! Ladies and gentlemen!
This - is a Jazze Phazelle, Slim Thugga
Slim Thug! Collaborinzale!
Oh boy! oh boy! oh boy!

It's such an incredible feeling
In this past year I done made a few million
I tried to hide it, but ain't no concealing
Stacking my paper, up to the ceiling
(I pimp) pimping since pimping been pimping
Macking since macking been macking
Y'all niggaz talking, but me and my niggaz make it happen (I pimp)
Y'all niggaz talking, but me and my niggaz make it happen
Y'all niggaz talking, but me and my niggaz make it happen

Slim having major change man, and it ain't no secret
With them diamonds chains and rings, it ain't hard to peep it
You can catch me in the shopping mall, ridiculous bash
Check my restroom trash, all I do is pop tags (pop tags)
And drop rags off of show room floors
Fa sho, I change loads like ho's change clothes
The whole industry knows, how we roll down in texas
Phantom Rolls on 24s, rose gold diamond necklace
Slim shows and tell, so these ho's know me well
I been closing candy doors since Pac was in jail
Hell, I can't complain it's a beautiful feeling
From being broke on ya ass to having cash to the ceiling

I was a mill plus before this record deal stuff
You niggaz talking but we walking shit, for real wit us
They think we country and ain't up on game
Until they see them different colors in the Boss Hogg chain
Or the blue spray Bentley valeted outside of the club
Is that 50 or Jay-Z? naw baby it's Thug
And I ain't playing in no league, or on teams with Steve
I ain't get this from no settlement that I didn't receive
Please believe, the world ain't seen too many me's
I don't think the lord created a lot of these G's
Cause these days I just sit back enjoying the feeling
I was broke on my ass now my cash to the ceiling

Pimping ain't dead! these ho's just scared!
You see it everywhere, but it starts in ya head
Next comes the bread, shit's sweet like Jiffy
Used to do beats for a G, but now a nigga get fifty
It's my time to shine, hard times behind me (bling!)
Forty gold and platinum plaques! and still climbing
And if I lose money, then the paper come find me
Said I was through with rapping, till Sho Nuff signed me
Thank God for the change, cause errbody ain't able
Made a mill slanging beats, that's not including my label
Jazze Pha, Sho Nuff, every crib with some cable
I got a dollar worth of dimes in my stable",Incredible Feelin' [A Cappella] [Acappella]

I'm the Dirty South Boss, you got a problem with that

We do the blue when we floss, you got a problem with that
And we'll knock your head off, who got a problem with that
B.H.O. run the streets, you got a problem with that
We overloaded with heat, you got a problem with that
We put fire to the beat, you got a problem with that
It's them Hoggs time to eat, who got a problem with that

Bitch niggaz bow down, when the Boss come around
'Fore I pop the fo' pound, and leave your head on the ground
We run the motherfucking town, you don't like it do some'ing
And you pussies just bumping, y'all ain't tal'n bout nothing
I got the F in cock, and the bitch ain't on safety
For you haters that hate me, go on 'head and make me
Unload the whole clip, 'fore I let a nigga take me
Mad cause your bitch trash ass, wanna date me
Ol' pussy ass nigga, you got bitch in your blood
My heart pump thug, I'll drop you in the club
On sight take your life, we can do the shit tonight
We could pull out the guns, or we could pick a square and fight nigga

You don't want no problems, you don't want no drama
I send them gunners in a Hummer, you won't even see the summer
I'ma pray for your mama, but her son gotta go
But her son was a hoe, so my gun gotta blow
Farewell, I'll see your pussy ass down in hell
Next day post bail, bitch I'm back up out of jail
They can't keep me in a cell, cause my money too long
Go to trial beat the case, cause my money too strong
OJ Simpson, you don't want it with me pimping
I'll stop pop the clip in, start pop until you dripping
Mayn you sucker niggaz tripping, Boss Hogg got it locked
You got a problem with that, I'll bring it to your block nigga

You can't see me nigga, you can't be me nigga
You can buy till you broke, you can't beat me nigga
You can't buy real niggaz, real niggaz get raised
And fuck being broke, real niggaz get paid
I don't break under pressure, real niggaz stay brave
And stay chose by hoes, cause real niggaz got it made
I'm a H-Town nigga, stay down nigga
You small time, I'm a heavyweight pound nigga
Don't hate clown nigga, I got cake now nigga
While you sleep, them Hoggs still awake clown nigga

Looking good by the herds, full of that endo herb

Gangsta shit

All my niggas is gone my damn bitch done cut
I got sum shit on my dome
Did they love me or what?
I'm one deep with my chrome like I ain't giving a fuck
If I got to do this alone fuck it that's wassup
They say it's lonely at the top an you
Gon' see who your real friends
No more fo doors I'm riding a coop benz
Keepin' it moving ain't focused on shit but not losing
If you don't fuck with me don't fuck with me
It's not confusing
And when you speak on my name watch the words your choosing
You soundin' like a hater to me it's so amusing
Instead of moving on trying to do your own thang
You recruiting for the we hate Slim Thug gang
But ain't shit change here mayne
I'm still the same
Life good up out the hood shit I can't complain
These niggas say they down, but they just pretend
I'm ridin' solo to the end
Fuck friends

And would my people miss me if they had to do without me
'Cause anything ain't no love
A nigga you think is yo homie is runnin' up in yo girl every time you leave her lonely
Each and every time I leave my house all three of my guns is on me
Ain't none of you niggas is goin' to
Be kicking or punching on me
And I learned my lesson about callin' my homies when I need 'em
Out of eleven one and a half
Shows up and the rest I still ain't seen 'em
One deep till I'm on my back
Ya'll fellas out might be on my sack
I'll shoot a muthafucker
If a muthafucker jump out of line then I'm a put 'em back in line

It's amazing how something so small can flip yo bitch ass anytime
I'm an og original gangster mayne organized general
Army ready to drop off chemicals

But it's business
Whenever I'm seen with a crowd that I'm not feeling
Enter the conversation and paper in my pocket I'm not feeling

Never thought I had peers that was undercover queers
Tell these snitches in my circle awhile back I would've murked yuh
I vouch for me an mine
'Til the gavel drop down
An judge gave my time since I hogged up
The ripper

Still in denial in the begginin' of my sentence

Turned to bitches

I spend it on what I want, reup and that's when I need
It's over you never see me, it's being salt as it's lesser
The niggas straight out the gutta, murder without a question
Bodies in my surroundings, clickclack from downing
All they know is he missing when niggas ain't never found him
Assaulting is the least, I don't live it on rejects
I'm a muthafuckin' killer foreal with the same threat
I'm as gangsta as it gets and my advice for you is lay your life
Ya never know when niggas might hit you in the city lights
Get it right, ya never know when niggas might hit you in the city lights
Get it right (get it right)

Born and raised on the north blocks, home of the hard knocks
Wanna get rich, find a spot to pump that hard out
Might get robbed and shot if niggas don't think you worthy
In my hood, I saw a lot of gangstas die early
Mama heart broke, and brother feel like he gotta fix it
So he loading up from straps, bout to hit it where they kick it
Got a first class ticket to the pen
Seventeen years old but up in that they all men
It's just another day, one come out, another go in
It's hard out here, you can't even trust yo friends
They'll have a nigga set up, whatever by the curb
It's every man for self, oh you ain't heard
I'm a muthafuckin' hog, survive through it all
Stand up tall, we don't fall, naw
I been shot at but ain't been shot
Been in plenty fight but ain't been drop
Always came out on top like a hardknock

Straight up
Yeah, these tattoo tears cover my face
My momma got mad at first but shit she know she may
I'm a g you gotta pray for me, it is what it is
Why these niggas out here playing, mayne this really my fear?
What'cha know about them late nights, no lights and no food?
No diapers for the baby's, the house smell like booboo
Think of what'chu would do what I tell ya what I does
Walk straight up off the porch, now the camus begun
My big brother on lock, so I starve his gut
He goin' lead to where he at, I been in the going stuff for crack and that
Big homie knew I had it on my mind
He ain't like it but it right that run it through my bloodline
He knew what he decline and what goin' be hard for me to find
So he choose to put me down, and I got up on my grind
The dawg and you hoes say I'm glorifying crack
My momma lights off, the whole house pitch black, bitch!

I run, the streets all night and day (The hood love Thug)
'Cause I still run, the streets all night and day (If you tryin' to find me)
(I rep for my city, go hard for the hood)
(Still posted on the block, what's good?)
And I run, the streets all night and day (Ha)
I can't stay away

They don't make too many niggas like me
Bonifide hustler, certified G
Still got that work if you got the right fee
You thankin' shit fake, well nigga come see
It's bigger than the jewels, it's bigger than the cars
It's bigger than the fact that we fuckin' rap stars
The street niggas know me, these boys got my contacts
Knowin' any given minute I can come back
I put a bitch on I-10 and tell her run dat
Give her ten and tell her don't brang nuttin' back
I'm still in the hood, I can't leave the streets
It's in my blood, I'm a thug 'til I be deceased

I run, the streets all night and day (The hood love Thug)
'Cause I still run, the streets all night and day (If you tryin' to find me)
(I rep for my city, go hard for the hood)
(Still posted on the block, what's good?)
And I run, the streets all night and day (Ha)
I can't stay away

It's hot on my block, somebody turn the fan on
I've been paid, I'm just tryin' to turn my mans on
And get my bread strong, streets miss me when I'm gone
I ""Put On"" for my city like Jeezy's song
Please believe me homes, matter fact check my stats
I ain't drop in three years, but I'm back
Where the money at?
That's the first question
You better pack a strap, that's the first lesson
Hard times got the whole United States stressin'
I'm writin' a book, ""How to Survive in a Recession""
Mr. Obama, we so tired of sellin' crack
If you lookin' for me ask the streets where I'm at

I run, the streets all night and day (The hood love Thug)
'Cause I still run, the streets all night and day (If you tryin' to find me)
(I rep for my city, go hard for the hood)
(Still posted on the block, what's good?)
And I run, the streets all night and day (Ha)
I can't stay away

It's home sweet home where the D-boys roam
Movin' stone for stone, or zone for zone
All night gettin' it on 'til 6 in the morn'
The shit I'm smokin' on, stronger then cologne
You can probably smell the smoke through your headphones
If you still broke better get your bread long
Call me on that burner 'cause them feds on my phone
And I'mma run the streets 'til I'm under my headstone

I run, the streets all night and day (The hood love Thug)
'Cause I still run, the streets all night and day (If you tryin' to find me)
(I rep for my city, go hard for the hood)

(slim thugga motherfucker)

I do this for the block I do this for the hood
I do this for the streets keep me good
I do it for the hustler cause I do it for the thugs
I do it for the G's cause the G's show me love
I came in the game 17 real loud only thing
On ma mind make my mama proud
Started rockin' crowds gettin' dough for show's
And as the fame rolls den came the hoes
Den came the cloths den came the cars
Next thing I know I'ma ghetto superstar
He come the haters travelin' by the packs
But never mind them cause uh bitch I'm back

I pour up a cup fill the swisha with good and fire it up 
So I can gather ma thoughts
(lets get high) Mo money mo problems
They say that's how it is when you live like a boss.
(like a boss) You see I've been goin' on ma grind
For sometimes and the streets thought a nigga fell off
(hell no nigga) But if I decide to rhyme no mo rhymes
I'ma still be well off
(cause bitch I'm back)

A born boss got nothin' to loose
Still shinin' in the game got nothin' to prove
Got rich and independent didn't need no deal
Had paper before I signed didn't need no meal
Got hustles on the side ain't got to rep
And if all else fails I still got the trap
I don't fuck wit you rappers
Y'all fake to me
I don't fuck wit y'all majors y'all snakes to me
I don't care about fame fuck bein' a star
Let them take all the pictures just gimme his car
Den gimme his house and his watch and chain
On the bank account, credit cards jock ma name (Thugga)
But I guess one come wit the other
So here I go I'ma writin' rap hustler
I'm too blessed to complain about that
So where I gotta sign? take ya pictures cause bitch I'm back

I pour up a cup fill the swisha with good and fire it up 
So I can gather ma thoughts

I'ma still be well off.
(cause bitch I'm back)

They say stay true for hits no, fuck it
I'ma gone keep it one-hundred fo the public (that's right)
I dropped all ready platinum but they only sell gold
And niggas lookin' at me like I sold ma soul
Cause I'm rappin' wit P and not mister Lee
But when ya on ya grind sometimes ya can't see
Before Mike Camo Paul the sign
I was at anascope can't find ma mind
Still dippin' wooden poppin' 3 kings just droppin'
And I'm an underground artist tryna get on top
So I listen to ma label, plan to break X and learned a whole lot a game from that.
Just stay true ma nigga and do you
And fuck what another try to tell you to do
They'll tell you to spit backs they can bump in them lexis
And oh yeah this a train track. bitch im back

Bring her over and let her get quick

Don't be shocked
Just let loose and show me how wet is your seat
I like her and she likes her
And I'm like why must we complete
Now it's three of us deep
And naughty
And I don't need no sheets

So, I'm just the type of guy
We're flying where you've never been
We feelin' get high
Yes higher than you've ever been
Higher than cloud nine
We're going where you've never been
So, sit yo' ass down

A lifetime warranty whenever you ride

It's guaranteed good service you'll be coming back

Slim Thug,"Comin' up as yungsta
Watchin' the OG's in the hood while they flossin' in they rides
Candy paint, chrome wheels, and black magic on the attire
Me, yeah I was lovin' it, but not old enough drive
Parkin' lot pimpin' from the passenger side
I use to walk everywhere I had to show up
Shoe hills, one down like wheel rubber, man I was about to go nuts
Hopefully I would blow up in these rap game man
My people roll swanga's, I wanted to be rollin' the same thang
Never had alot of work, but I was doin' what I could
Movin' nickles, dimes, twenty's, and ounces all threw my hood
Since I had a one yolla fines cash me up
Mean while thumpin' for a ride my homies pass me up
It's all gravy, when I'm able I'm a showin' all somthin'
From a hopte to a foreign, I'm ballin' it's all or nothin'
Treat my feet with' designer to fine sneak's when I leave my home
Only place you catch me walkin' is to my mail box's
Cause on the streets I be on crome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rollin' chrome

Huh, I started off with' a canary yellow cutlass supreme on bald tire's
Yeah I know I was out of line
But that was all I could find
Or should I say that was all I could purchase for what I had to spend
But at least I had somthin' to go from point A to B and
No more offerin' gas money to get a lift
Besides when your driven it's easyer to get a chick
So ani't no more parkin' lot pimpin' at the club I'm up in there
Seekin' little mama, with' thick thighs, I hope she let me in there
Like swim wear, pull up to the motel, and we'll go in there
Nothin' left to do but comit a sin there
And that was in my hopte, but when I show up in my big body with' the gloss
All of the boppers was boppin' I just could'nt shake'm off
Sixteen switches, tewnty-two inches, trunk goin' to war
They don't want to lay here with me, they want to lay in my car
I was lovin' it back then and still love it today
Except I'm not yellow cutlase no more, I'm 300 blue over gray, on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rolin chrome

Finally I'm in the mix, ridin' twenty four's or twenty six
My neck and my wrist lite, with' out me sellin' a brick
Tv's in the roof and the dashboard and I'm watchin' a flick
Rollin' with my pistol in my lap and I'm cockin' if
I spy somethin' suspicious in my rear view mirror when I'm creepin'
If you plan on jackin' me I plan on leavin' you sleepin'
I be in different vehicle cause I'm havin' thangs
King of the ghetto entertainment got me havin' change
You can smell it on me, even tho quite, the way I live it be tellin' on me
Don't get twisted I'm still a felon homie
Thinkin' you goin' to rob me that's a N O
And when I'm in N O I roll with god and as always Mr.Marsello
And they be with me when they in Texas don't par take it as a spy
Harlum nights in stores where they drop it like it's hot
So if your tryin' to call me and I don't answer my phone
I can't hear it cause my music to loud I'm bangin' on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome (rollin chrome)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (rollin chrome)
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on (holdin' on)
I'll keep rolin chrome (yaah)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (yes I am)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (I'm rollin chrome)

Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that

My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times

I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys

But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank

S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car

Found my way out the game, now my family straight
'Cause they know they ain't never seeing me in that place
Can't wait 'til Sha get home, we gon' still stunt hard
Can't wait 'til King Dre get free, we gon' look like the mobb
Corn just touched down, the feds done took out my friends
None of 'em tried to hurt nobody was tryna make a few ends
That came to an end, I don't believe in the game

Tryna be home with the fam', see my kids grow up
I'm too old for new cases to start showing up
If you could slang 'caine you can slang anything

Only difference with us, is you stopped
Ain't no shortcuts just hard work
And always make sure you keep God first (Amen)
Tougher your times, the bigger your blessings
Live right, when you make mistakes learn your lessons
'Cause ain't nothing funny about being a dummy
Make sure you get your mind right if you want this money
It's hard to get this paper, even harder to keep it
You gotta educate yourself that's the real secret
And once you start living your dreams, why be anything else when you can be a king?

And it's waiting there for you and me

Each star's a pool of water, cool water
But with the dawn I'll wake and yawn
And carry on to water, cool, clear, water

The shadows sway and seem to say
Tonight we pray for water, cool, water
And way up there He'll hear our prayer
And show us where there's water, cool, clear, water

Just one thing more than water, cool, water

I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo

Slim Whitman,"We have been gay, going our way
Life has been beautiful, we have been young
After you've gone, life will go on
Like an old song we have sung

When I grow too old to dream
I'll have you to remember
When I grow too old to dream
Your love will live in my heart
So, kiss me my sweet
And so let us part

That kiss will live in my heart

That kiss will live in my heart

Slim Whitman,"To the tables down at Mory's
To the place where Louie dwells
To the dear old Temple bar we love so well
Sing the Whiffenpoofs assembled with their glasses raised on high
And the magic of their singing casts it's spell

Yes, the magic of their singing of the songs we love so well
""Shall I Wasting"" and ""Mavourneen"" and the rest
We will serenade our Louie while life and voice shall last
Then we'll pass and be forgotten with the rest

We're poor little lambs who have lost our way
Baa, baa, baa
We're little black sheep who have gone astray

Gentleman songsters off on a spree
Doomed from here to eternity
Lord have mercy on such as we

Slim Whitman,"By the valley road
The lilacs are growin'
Around the mill
With an old water wheel

In his dusty coat
The river sits dreamin'
Of his true love
The pretty Lucille

The old water wheel
Keeps turning and turning
It seems to seize
All the kisses it sees

On the soft summer nights
When the hearts were alive
Making love to the sound
Of the old water wheel

In her eyes of blue
True heaven made green
And her hair was brown
As the meadow lark's wing

Every smile revealed
White pearls, empty dreamin'
And nature made her lips
Just to sing

But fate was unkind
She sneaked neath the lilacs
This dizzy world
Keeps moving along

But the old river seems
To be lost in his dreams
While the water wheel turns
As it's singin' this song

Lost in the song
Of the old water wheel

(Fade to end)
The old water wheel
The old water wheel",Song of the Old Water Wheel
Slim Whitman,"There's a rainbow in every teardrop you're crying
There's a love song in every treetop above
There's a star's face in every snowflake that's falling
There's hope when our hearts dream of love
 
There's a diamond in every dewdrop that glistens
There's a gold mine in every sunset you see
There's a rainbow in every teardrop you're crying 
So dry up your tears and kiss me

Slim Whitman,"I feel so bad I've got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind on Blue Bayou

Savin' nickels, savin' dimes
Workin' till the sun don't shine
Lookin' forward to happier times on Blue Bayou

I'm goin' back some day, come what may, to Blue Bayou
Where you sleep all day and the catfish play on Blue Bayou
All those fishin' boats with their sails afloat, if I could only see
That familiar sunrise thru sleepy eyes how happy I'd be

Oh, to see my baby again
And to be with some of my friends
Maybe I'd be happy then on Blue Bayou

I'm goin' back some day, gonna stay on Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine and the world is mine on Blue Bayou
Ah, that girl of mine by my side
The silver moon and the evening tide
Ah, some sweet day gonna take away this hurtin' inside

I'll never be blue, my dreams come true

Hold me close
Never let me go

And broken promises mean love must fade and die 
I trusted you, you can't be true 
My heart no longer sings 
It's wings are broken too 

Life was wonderful 
I flew as high as a bird in the sky 
Dreaming of you 
Dreams coming true 
Then in your eyes 
I saw lies in disguise

Slim Whitman,"Somewhere, my love there will be songs to sing
Although the snow covers the hope of spring
Somewhere a hill blossoms in green and gold
And there are dreams all that your heart can hold

Someday we'll meet again my love
Someday whenever the spring breaks through

You'll come to me out of the long ago
Warm as the wind, soft as the kiss of snow

Slim Whitman,"Once I had a secret love
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
And why I am so in love with you

Now I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils

At last my heart's an open door
And my secret love's no secret anymore",Secret Love [From Calamity Jane]
Slim Whitman,"Fallen angel ripped and bruised
Think on better days
Life is rude, treats you bad
Tears your wings away
Raise your eyes to star and sky
Believe in fly aways
Take your dreams, your broken schemes
And sweep the past away
 
Fly lonely angel
High above these streets of fire
Fly lonely angel
Far away from mad desire
 
Hollywood ain't paved with gold
It's just a trick of light
Sunset falls on stars of old
And blinds you with its light
A spiders web of tangled lives
Lays stretched across the hills
From distances it's glistening
Like el dorado's halls
 
Fly lonely angel
High above these streets of fire
Fly lonely angel
Leave behind the mad desire
 
The dream was light
And fragrant nights
But how were you to know
The streets are hard
They're mean and scarred
Where only fools find gold
 
Fly lonely angel
High above these streets of fire
Fly lonely angel
Leave behind the mad desire
 
Fly lonely angel
Spread your wings another way
Fly lonely angel
Find a better way, a better day",The Angel Song
Slim Whitman,"To sail on a dream on a crystal clear ocean,
To ride on the crest of a wild raging storm
To work in the service of life and living,
In search of the answers of questions unknown
To be part of the movement and part of the growing,
Part of beginning to understand,

Aye Calypso the places you've been to,
The things that you've shown us, the stories you tell
Aye Calypso, I sing to your spirit,
The men who have served you so long and so well

Hi dee ay-ee ooo doo-dle oh
Oo do do do do do doo-dle ay yee 
Doo-dle ay ee 

Like the dolphin who guides you, you bring us beside you
To light up the darkness and show us the way
For though we are strangers in your silent world
To live on the land we must learn from the sea
To be true as the tide and free as a wind swell
Joyful and loving in letting it be

Slim Whitman,"(Roses, roses)
If I sent a rose to you for every time you made me blue
You'd have a room full of roses
If I sent a rose of white for every time I cried all night
You'd have a room full of roses

If you'd took the petals and tore 'em all apart
You'd be tearing half the roses just the way you tore my heart
And if some day you're feeling blue you could send some roses too
Well I don't want a room full of roses
I just want my arms full of you

You'd have a room full of roses

Slim Whitman,"Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring

When I was young my heart was young then too
Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you
When you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you",Snowbird

Maman je serai là 
Sois tranquille ton fils sera là 
Je serai là 
Maman je serai là 
Dors tranquille ton fils sera là 

Quand il y aura plus de bougies que de gâteaux a ton anniversaire

Quand ta beauté se sera fait la malle et laissera place à ton charme 
Quand dans la rue on te demandera avez vous besoin d'aide madame 

Je serai là

On a fait comme tous les autres, on s'est promis notre vie
Et moi comme un petit con j'y crois encore aujourd'hui
J'aimerais tellement te haïr, pouvoir te souhaiter le pire

Que je buvais la mort pour oublier d'souffrir

Ivre de ce parfum si différent du tien, pire
J'ai compté chaque minute qui me retient à elle
Comme si j'étais mon propre prisonnier
Ça fait bientôt un an qu'elle m'a sauvé, de toi
Souvent je me demande où j'en serais, pour toi
Souvent je me demande ce que tu fais, où tu es, qui tu aimes
Sors de mes pensées!
J'ai changé d'adresse, de numéro, merci
J'ai balancé tes lettres et tes défauts, même si
J'ai fais semblant d'avoir trouvé la force, je garde au plus profond de moi

Elle a séché toutes mes larmes, tu sais
Elle a ramassé tes pots cassés
Et elle a réglé tout, tes impayés, tes impostures, tes ratures

And it's a damn shame
Yeah

This game real, boy, you can get scarred and barred in it
If your heart ain't in it, caught up in this world spinnin'
Before you started you was finished, dehydrated and deplenished
Niggaz is all washed up without a swallow in they cup
'cause every time a chicken cluck, you trickin' a buck
You pressed your luck and got stuck, fuckin' up the re-up

That's the ones with big talk and no game
Spendin' chips but no change
All the dope and no caine, war stories but no pain
The same ones that pop lip then flag ship
Then gotta hip skip before real niggaz pop clips
You better hop hip

Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well

Niggaz slum and slimmed out
Chevy's is primed out
Hit traps and grind out
What's poppin', let's find out

Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well

To Adams ville

And Killa Kill
Got 'dro and plenty pills
Cuttin' blows, hoes and dip

Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well

In God, I trust and in the crowds I bust
Smokin' weed to calm down, I'm so blown off dust
It's harder to feel pain when my brains is mush
I know it's fucked up, how fathers turn they back on us

And our sick sad mamas smoking crack on up
Slime-ass po-po right in the back of us
Connected muthafuckas got better crack than us
But rich muthafuckas ain't gon' mash like us
Hear sirens coming and continue to bust

Lustful ways, livin' in these mistrustful days
Who said crime don't pay, niggaz out here cockin' K's
Don't drop, they spray, one shot, you lay, toxic waste
One pine box, one case, I'll block yo place

I beat niggaz senseless for Jordans and sixty dollars
Pinned hoes' toes to the earlobes and collars
In the back of a Impala, all to deliver pain
Twist her frame and hear her holler
So savage that it's gettin' harder

For me to see redemption in tomorrow
So far from God that I'm finding righteous paths hard to follow
I'm gulping vodka, I'm killin' sorrow in the bottom of a sky bottle
So depressed and sick and Slimm young and gifted
I'm just sick and twisted

Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well

Corner-clockin', in the backroom work-choppin'
From Biscayne to Boat rockin', one-stop shoppin'
Guarded by glock and cash, ain't no stoppin'
They party pill-droppin' till all the drawers droppin'
'Droed up, my niggaz stay poured up, sho nuff

Hold up, big bank we fold up, so who wanna roll up?
We got that heat, so you better drop that beef
Before they pop and sweep your whole block in one heap

[Slimm Calhoun]
I was born with the mission, supposed to be impossible
All my life I've heard plenty of shit, lots of bull
like you just a nigga, you'll never get a job
so you best be at sellin dope or rob
Learn how to shoot a nine before I come around
Stay down on the ground, sackin every dime
Know a nigga seein hard time
Tryin to skip these lines so everything I knew was big time
Before you slip n slide in the dirt
Great crime, til the church fell down on the niggaz on the block
I gotta get mine to get serious when I'm focused
Call the curtain and misplaced all the searchin
I got partner servin life 
Jackin for small change or cause they foundthe habit or couldn't maintain
We're all lookin for better things
And I heard it in my dream, as she sings

[chorus]
If I give you an inch will you try for the yard
Yeah, if my eyes see it
Well he's laughingright now but I know that he cries
He says it's changin, goes like the wind, just like the wind

[Slimm Calhoun]
Situation haters, tryin to superface me and my cousin
Like a dirty half a dozen was buzzin and caught duckin
Slippin with mine ain't safe
God don't let 'em take me 
He's bucks shake, too late for Pammy, she had to get goin
Like an escaper, it was like a train when I was away
Thank the lord for savin me
Took one for the real trip, too greedy
I tell you y'all niggazis shady, so packed out
y'all play me, fight me with niggazthat sick and consistant
I'm tired of all these kids pullin the trigger to show what they did
Kids in world is so fucked up
Little Joey thought he had to make a kill to be cool
And his best friend dropped out of school
Now where could he be, 
somewhere in the streets slangin keys? I don'tknow
But it's to me you motherfuckers, 
in the dope hangin just as many tryin to rap
And I heard a sayin, in my dream

[chorus]

[Slimm Calhoun]
Currently bitch niggaz is still doin the same shit
Drivebys, get some fo-fos since birth
Clickin work, now, who ain't gonna get hurt
Bystanders, innocent, gettin caught in the firecrossin
And lives bein lost in the mix of ammo blastin, cars crashin, gas
mashin, guns stashin while mothers cry
The fools laughin, get shit happen

Slint,"I stepped out onto the midway.
I was looking for the pirate ship,
And saw this small, old white tent at one end.
It was blue,
And had white lights hanging all around it.
I decided to check out the tent,
It seemed like I could hear music coming from inside.
As I walked toward it, I passed a crowd of people at the sideshow.
I couldn't figure out why they would want to wait in line.

I pulled back the drape thing on the tent.
There was a crystal ball on the table,
And behind it, a girl wearing a hat.
She smiled, and asked me if I wanted my fortune read.
I said okay,
And sat down.
Then I thought about it for a minute,
And asked her if she would rather go on the roller coaster instead.

Creeping up into the sky.
Stopping, at the top and,
Starting down.
The girl grabbed my hand,
I clutched it
Tight.
I said goodbye to the ground.

Far below, a soiled man.
A bucket of torn tickets at his side.
He watches the children run by
And picks his teeth.

Spinning round,
My head begins to turn.
I shouted, and searched
The sky for a friend.
I heard the fortune teller,
Screaming back at me.
We stuck out our hands and met the winds.

The girl falters as she steps down from the platform.
She clutches her stomach, and begins to heave.
The ticket-taker smiles, and the last car is ready.
Who told you that you could leave?

The sun was setting by the time we left.
We walked across the deserted lot, alone.
We were tired, but we managed to smile.
At the gate I said goodnight to the fortune teller.
The carnival sign threw colored shadows on her face,
But I could tell she was blushing.",Breadcrumb Trail
Slint,"Let me in, the voice cried softly, 
from outside the wooden door. 
Scattered remnants of the ship could be seen in the distance, 
Blood stained the icy wall of the shore. 

I'm the only one left. The storm, took them all, 
He managed as he tried to stand. 
The tears ran down his face. 
Please, it's cold. 

When he woke, there was no trace of the ship. 
Only the dawn was left behind by the storm. 
He felt the creaking of the stairs beneath him. 
That rose, from the sea, to the door. 

There was a sound at the window then. 
The captain started, his breath was still. 
Slowly, he turned. 

From behind the edge of the windowsill, 
There appeared the delicate hand of a child. 
His face was flush and timid. 
He stared at the captain through frightened eyes. 

The captain reached for something to hold on to, 
Help me, he whispered, as he rose slowly to his feet. 
The boy's face went pale, 
He recognized the sound. 

Silently, he pulled down the shade against the shadow. 
Lost in the doorstep of the empty house. 

I'm trying to find my way home. 

I'm sorry 
And I miss you. 

I miss you. 
I've grown taller now. 
I want the police to be notified.

Slint,"I live in a castle 
I am a prince 
On days I try 
To please my queen 

Soon as I start	to smile
With my smiling queen 
Who sits across the table 
By the food she made

Like a bat I flushed the girl
And I flew out my back door
And I came to no one no more
She ran without glances
And railed like a red coal train
She ran without glances
And railed like a red coal train

Eyelids are opened 
When the sun is high
I slip away from my queen's
Grey stare

I can be settled down
and be doing just fine
Until I heard that old train
Rolling down the line

With the light she disappeared
And set me in a whirl
And I hope that beautiful girl
I set a fire burning
And I railed on through the night
I set a fire burning
And I railed on through the night

She peeked around the corner
She offered me her hand
My teeth touched her skin
Then she was gone again

Remember me as you fall to sleep.
Fill your pockets with the dust and the memory,
That rises from the shoes on my feet.

I won't be back here
Though we may meet again.

I know, it's dark outside
Don't be afraid.
Every time I ever cried for fear,
Was just a mistake that I made.
Wash yourself in your tears,
And build your church
On the strength of your faith.

Please,
Listen to me,
Don't let go,
Don't let this desperate moonlight leave me,
With your empty pillow,
Promise me
The sun will rise again.

It never ends, and with the gifts Luna sends, to the apocalypse

A pleasure that will take my mind off the reality of life
My past life
Life as I know it know
And whatever may come it slowly disappears
To somewhere in the back of my mind
It will remain there until I wish to retrieve it

Yes I will stay here for awhile for I need the break
A break from the pressures of life
And everything that lay in the palm of life's hands, life's hands

It's out of this world

Broke away my tear spout!

With my tongue spread wide open
A black widow had offered me
A sweetheart tube
As I injected
The candid heart that I selected
She said don't hesitate

To somewhere in the back of my mind

When everything that lays in the palm of life's hands

Look in my eyes for the answers, typical
I can feel it underneath like a miracle
Everybody in the world needs more than
Lies and consequences to power them

Once again, it's me and no one else
I can't remember if there was a someone else
It's not mine, it's not fair, it's outta my hands
And it's shaking, you'll never take me

Bitter, bitter as the stink of when I try
I'm not supposed to be here, I'm not supposed to be, no

Pull your hands away, I'm gone
Goodbye, it's so depressing, withering away
Take a look inside, my soul is missing

The uncontrollable urges that made me a menace
I'm all your problem, do you even care?
Pretend it's all a lie, that's how we made it here

Can't abate the truth with your secrets,
But you were far too impressed with your pretense
Now as far as I know, I don't know anything
'Cause you made damn sure, I wasn't anything

The only way to go is to go away
Discarded, Retarded
Before I let you go, you have to let me

Crawl away from human clay
We our the broken shards beyond disarray
Before you cut them, you rape them
(Feed us by going on!)
Gonna go from my souls to my throat
You shouldn't wall us up with your apathy
But you did and now you're only growing enemies
This is the catalyst, the alpha, the first breed
'Cause you made damn sure, now we're everything

Distractions, Reactions
The only way to go is to go away
Discarded, Retarded

Maximize our prize of a record
It's all on the path and the words are of murder

I will save you from my sins

(What is wrong with this
Manipulation
Violence and Chaotic)

Destroy my taste and all that's right
I slam you shut, I can only take so much
How many times do I have to mistreat you?
'Cause you leap out of my hand as I feed you
Maybe now you'll understand severity
I sum it up with offense no matter poverty

Welcome to the transformation
Welcome to annihilation
Welcome to the man that wanted
Everything, but couldn't have it

The only way to go is to go away
Discarded, Retarded

Back away from tangents  on the verge of drastic
Ways, can't escape this place, I deny your face
Sweat gets in my eyes  I think I'm slowly dying

Put me in a homemade cellar
Put me in a hole for shelter
Someone hear me please  all I see is hate
I can hardly breathe  and I can hardly take it

Hands on my face overbearing I can't get out

Lost, ran at my own cost, hearing laughter, scoffed
Learning from the rush, detached from such and such
Bleak, all around me, weak, listening, incomplete
I am not a dog, but I'm the one your dogging

I am in a buried kennel
I have never felt so final
Someone find me please, losing all reserve
I am fucking gone, I think I'm fucking dying

You all stare, but you'll never see
There is something inside me
There is something in you I despise

Cut me, show me, enter, I am
Willing and able and never any danger to myself

Or was my tolerance a phase?

That was all I got and now you got me

All I ever really wanted was to take the blame
I will go down in history and not down in flames
Meningitis,
I will survive this,
Dry sockets and a schizophrenic crisis
The time of the nine has begun
Get out of the way or you will suffer as one

This is so typical,
Apocalyptical,
Hanging on abysmal release,
Jesus,
I don't need this,
Don't wanna be this,
Icon in the making,
My hands are fucking shaking

What if god doesn't care?
What if god doesn't care?

Remember,
Surrender,
The time is now
Continue,
We're in you,
And we will burn your cities down

America is a killing name
It doesn't feel or discriminate
Life is just a killing field
It's all that's left, nothing's real
Throw away your disposable past
And fall apart like a cigarette ash
We are the fatal and vital ones of the world
And we will burn your cities down

What if god doesn't care?
What if god doesn't care?

Down,

We will burn your cities down
We will burn your cities down

We will burn your cities down
Feed the hungry, feed them shit
Feed them bones and politics
You wanna revolutionize?
Be specific and believe your eyes
Start a war in another backyard
And we'll destroy your house of cards
Give me a minute and I'll change your mind
Give me a bullet and I'll change your life

Remember,
Surrender,
The time is now
Continue,
We're in you,
And we will burn your cities down

America is a killing name
It doesn't feel or discriminate
Life is just a killing field
It's all that's left, nothing's real
Throw away your disposable past
And fall apart like a cigarette ash
We are the fatal and vital ones of the world
And we will burn your cities down, down, down

Sweat gets in my eyes, I think I'm slowly dying

Put me in a homemade cellar
Put me in a hole for shelter
Someone by me please, all I see is hate
I can hardly breathe, and I can hardly take it

Hands on my face, overbearing I can't get out
Hands on my face, overbearing I can't

Lost, run at my own cost, fearing laughter, scoffed
Running from the rush, detached from such and such
Bleak all around me, weak, listening, incomplete
I am not a dog, but I'm the one you're dogging

I am in a buried kennel
I have never felt so final
Someone find me please, losing all reserve
I think I'm gonna go crazy

Hands on my face overbearing, I can't get out
Hands on my face overbearing, I can't

You all stare, but you'll never see, something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see, something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see, something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something in you I despise

Cut me, show me, enter
I am willing and able and never any danger to myself
Knowledge of my pain, knowledge of my pain
Or was my tolerance a phase? Empathy, out of my way

I can't die, I can't die
I can't die, I can't die

You all stare, but you'll never see, something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see, something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see, something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something in you I despise

Yet I'm the one who's obscene

But that doesn't matter now
I've come relaxed
I'm curled up in a ball, and shaking
I'm hiding from the hell I'm making
I can't believe the chance I'm taking
Is there any other way?
Is there any other way?

The burden
The burden

(You can't save me)
There is nothing more to give
(I am changing)
Almost like I never lived
(Be me witness)
Just don't leave me in suspense
(Keep this, prove it)
Tell them all the consequences

The burden
(Have you ever been burdened before?)
The burden
(Was there anything you wanted more?)

(You can't save me)
There is nothing more to give
(I am changing)
Almost like I never lived
(Be my witness)
Just don't leave me in suspense
(Keep this, prove it)
Tell them all the consequences

Our same plea
By now you know that looks are deceiving
I'm covered in a rash and receding
Is there any other way?
Is there any other way?

His pain is now our lives

It's safer in an encage

Now their plans are un-detoured
Who can bring them in to sew the seed?

Sometimes when it's all you want
Maybe satisfaction will take you for granted

You did everything for me
You were there for me every single day

I was frustrated with my problems
And took it all out on you
Looking back it hurts me so much
Can't believe what I put you through

I told her affection had two F's

In my autobiography
I figured, who would know
Better than me?

I'm certainly the former
But I'm not so much the latter
But no one's gonna read it
So I'm sure it doesn't matter

When you find that you're the former
Take pride in how you form
And when you find that you're the ladder
Don't let those people walk under you

I'm writing ""sharp and adult""
With my finger on the steam
On the mirror in my bathroom
And I'm applying shaving cream

Which would suggest that I'm the foamer
But how can I be the lather
And something tells me
It's the opposite I'd rather

When you find that you're the foamer
Be careful what you foam
When you find that you're the lather
Don't shave too high, you'll regret it later
La la la la 

I've stayed in school this long
But still no one will tell me why
They figured who would know
Better than I?

I know I'm a conformer
But I'm sure it doesn't matter
My new friends are all adults
And my old friends all have scattered

When you find you're a conformer
Take pride and swallow whole

And all that dwell within your gates 
We'll wish you ten times more.

Go down into the cellar 
And see what you can find, 

If the barrels are not empty 
We'll hope that you'll be kind,

With your apple and your pear,

Slobberbone,"For sixteen days, I've stayed in this bedroom
And this Indian Summer, It's made me sick
I don't use the phone, I don't write no letters
All I can do is lay here and sweat

And this wretched house, It falls down around me
The air has turned foul, the walls have turned brown
And they rot in the glow of a single light bulb
Once there was paint, now there's just dust

And I don't know why I'm kept a prisoner here
But there's no fear in these eyes
And I don't know why no one talks to me
But it's so clear when you try ...

She had grace, and a natural beauty
She was a girl raised on a farm
A constant source of disappointment
To both of her folks, and they don't know why

'Cause she had a love for a life she suspected
Lay somewhere else, beyond these crops
But she couldn't speak, and they wouldn't listen
So her dreams lay fallow and hope turned to dust

And I don't know why I'm kept a prisoner here
But there's no fear in these eyes
And I don't know why no one talks to me
But it's so clear when you try ...

We sit in the yard, on broken-down loungers
Tryin' to grill food on a rusted out grill
Drinkin' a beer and burnin' our fingers
Watching the dog pee on the car

And the trees all look sick now and the grass has turned brown
And the bird bath's broken, and the fence fallen down
And the gate, it hangs crooked on rusted out hinges
And the heat never leaves when the sun sinks down

And once we had meaning, but now, we're just hollow
Once we felt pain, but now we're just numb
Once there were words, but now there's just glances
And once we were smart but now we're just dumb ...
just dumb

And I don't know why I'm kept a prisoner here
But there's no fear in these eyes
And I don't know why no one talks to me

And can throw a fit, fuss, holler and spit ...
Cuss and bitch and scoff

And true, if I were in your shoes,
I'd do the same, my friend,
Then I'd dunk you in the river once again.

So you talked to all my friends
And you fed them lines, lies and alibis
Tried to do me in

They're all braced for a knock-down bout,
but I don't care who wins
I'll just dunk you in the river once again.

It's a long road outa here
And paved, it seems, with misplaced dreams
Heartache, doubt and fear

But I've finally found a drink
to wash away all the world's sins
And I'll dunk you in the river once again.

'Cause if we can't fight, then be all right,
we're done for in the end ...

Slobberbone,"My sister sent me to come and get you in,
It's time to take your dinner and you know you're to come in when your called.
I can see you up on the highest limb
And the sky looks to be stormin' and you'll be cold by mornin'

When I returned without you, her head was filled with words
Her tongue could not withhold, see, so she let them fly to scold me
I told I'd seen you up on the highest limb
She said the night was stormin' and you'd be dead by mornin'

Little sister where have you gone
In the night I hear you cryin' and the days are so damn long.
Sometimes I wish that I could've gone instead of you,
And I wonder if you were sittin' here, would you be wishin' that too.

The woods were damp and the air was green.
A beautiful spring morning, now what could serve as warning.
And I'd often seen it, rotten wood and broken bricks,
A long rope and a pail, and a hole going straight to hell.

And your big brother, you'd do anything to catch his smile
But you couldn't catch him runnin', so you'd just duck and hide for awhile.
And I didn't hear you, I didn't even try
I was a hundred yards away and I thought you'd run off somewhere to play.

The ground was clay, we dug a shallow grave.
And laid ourselves to sleep, there just outside the fields where we once played.
And I remember, the way we mourned and cried
And tried to start the healing, but what the stone was revealing was a lie ...

Yeah but a rolling heart gathers no moss, only shit and sticks and stones
So I left those days behind me, and I struck out on my own

She don't feel the need to slap me or stick pencils in my ear
So what's she have that you ain't got to spur this little tryst?
Well there's sanity for starters, oh hell, I'll just make a list.

And, yeah, I'm getting married, so just let me clear the air
Hell no, you're not invited, but I know that you don't care
And you'll be there with guns and goofy ribbons in your hair

Lives a funny little lady and a rodeo clown
And she swears she's loved him all her life
Promises one day he's gonna make her his wife
Have a couple kids and a little plot of land
Open themselves up a BBQ stand,
Just like Engine Joe on the other side of town
Funny little lady and the rodeo clown
Rodeo clown thinks that Engine Joe is fat
Still he wouldn't talk about Engine Joe like that
Once upon a time there was a race car racer,
And he had himself a suped up AMC Pacer
It was shaped like a bubble, but it drove really fast
Racer couldn't drive so the Pacer it crashed
Got himself a guy with a truck that could tow her
Still he said he didn't think that guy could fix its motor
But that guy he didn't care; he fixed it just the same
I guess that's how Engine Joe got his name
Now he wrangles beef in a BBQ stand
Ever since the day that he mangled his hand
He doesn't care
He just keeps on smokin'

My mandolin hangs on the wall once again
I can't seem to find the right words from within,
But I won't be looking for long

There comes a time when nothing seems clear'
Your past out on the front porch with a head full of beer,
Confused and clouded by thoughts of you dear
But I won't be thinking for long

So many years ago when I was pure,
I was drunk on direction but afflicted with a cure
For all ailments cynical, that's how things were
But I didn't stay drunk for too long

Notions and knowledge came and sobered me up
I sipped from their bottle; I slammed a whole cup
That swill seemed to sit well, but I should've thrown it up
Cause it didn't sit well for too long

I was a fool
I was stupid because
I was mistaking knowledge for just a good buzz
Five years drunk on wine and words and wit
Served by cynics and charlatans
They were all full of shit

Empty cans of frustration and cans of regret
Line the living room floor that you've often swept
Pop another one open and wretch at the stench
It's a hard drink to swallow for a thirst you can't quench

But there'll come a time when it all seems clear
When your past out on the front porch, your head full of beer
Confused and clouded by thoughts of you dear,
But I won't be clouded for long

My mandolin hangs on the wall once again

Songs about screwing up
No matter how much I fall down,
It seems it's never enough
No matter how much good luck
Throws itself my way,
I find some way to ruin it;
Fall down again the next day

Road rashed, run down, wrinkled from the rain
The song in my heart makes just one sound,
But I sing along just the same
And I wonder how long I'll hang around
Before I go insane
Before I break down
And get gone again
Put myself on trial again for crimes I couldn't see
My naked aggression was picked up on a charge of indecency
And I remember how I felt when first it exposed itself to me
And pray for forgiveness, and a sympathetic jury

The song in my heart makes just one sound,

Any plans that you might have had; swept right out the door

But I cheated on them,
With a woman named Whiskey,
And Gin, her best friend

To a thousand other men,
Who'll trade loving for liquor;
Salvation for sin

Of attachments once forged with a fiery rambunction

It's about the easy sheen of alcohol, of better-not-do's done
Of blinking lights and the curse of roomates' tongues

Slobberbone,"Ben grew up to be the butcher not by choice, it's just the lot in life he found
But he makes a decent living, feeds his family and the people of the town
But there's no dreams brought to fruition, just a gradual attrition
The decayed scraps of ambition he once carved by hand
But there's no time for regrets, it's not as bad as it appears
He's got a lucrative career but he never gets the bloodstains off his hands 
A killer frequents bars on Ladies' Night with a steely-eyed command
But he ain't out cruising hookers and he ain't no shady looker, he's a charming, handsome man
His voice says 'ladies' but his mind is thinking 'bitches'
But his pitch is just too much for most of them to withstand
He tells them jokes and he gets them all in stitches
And it goes off without hitches 'till he tries to get the bloodstains off his hands 
Nothing good comes easy
Isn't that what you would have me to believe
For every positive endeavor there is a dark side we must weather
You will see, yeah you will see 
All the coroners and corpsmen and the slaughterhouse foremen
It's just there job five days a week, please try and understand
It's their lot to get through it, they know someone's got to do it
And try not to misconstrue it when they try to wash the bloodstains off their hands 

Now she's had seven years of happiness with a boy she's always claimed to have adored
And there's fewer who've been truer but as of late she finds herself a little bored
She tells him she still loves him and has only good thoughts of him
And the times they've had and hopes that it'll help him understand
When she runs her knife straight through him, it's the only way to do them
She's the winner of the game but she'll never get the bloodstains off her hands 
In the end, they all fall just the same but she'll never get the bloodstains off her hands

And the ghosts of friends who've moved along
Can still be felt but they don't sing along
To your stubborn, stupid song
You've been pretending loss could be your gain
But in the end you're just as lame
Now where have you been? You've been in the down town again
And it's the same old thing:
The flailing fall, the flake and wallow, forsaking friends
And where have you gone? 'Cause you been gone so damn long. 
Okay, what's wrong,

Some buffer for the years ahead
Means nothing if you're living dead
Now where have you gone?

Your memory's stained, you make the disconnect between the heart and brain
You figured loss could be your gain 
You read the contract and you signed your name
Said goodbye and walked away 
You figured loss could be your gain
In some fickle lease that's paid in shame
But in the end you're just as lame
In sad attempts to pluck some gem
From down below and deep within
With hazy eyes and sallow skin you wait to find just

Are you the only one to have ever once felt strong and then lost where you belong? 
And what have you seen? Was it all that you had ever dreamed?
Is there beauty to be dredged and skimmed in filthy nets
And lifted from these beery depths?
To be dragged and strewn upon the shore or simply scraped up off the floor
Attested to through glass-bottom eyes soft and sad and sore

Working hands and a gentle heart
Beacon-like to those in the dark
His wife and family headed home, a flash of chrome
A pothole's teeth makes tires slide
To shoulders too thin to abide
A sleeping driver, wayward truck, now he's stuck 
Knotted heart, he cracks and curls
His bedroom becomes his world
Idle curtains block the sun, now he's done
His remaining daughter will suggest

Jamie Jeffries has a plan
And a mother who's his biggest fan
She wants it all for him so much, but she's out of touch
Persuasive friends, a gang of four, the convenience of convenience stores

That there is still a need, it's true
When you can't find the out like most do
And still you must confess
That things are still a mess, for sure
When you're less in her eyes than before 
So you've wrung your eyes of all their tears
And you caught them in a glass
To save them for some day next year, when you're waxing over your past

Find your glass of last year's tears and you take a taste

It only comes in trade

You live on in the dark 

Rolling papers, bottles and needles, and people we trusted
Our eyes just become too adjusted
We'd be busted 
If sightlessness were a crime
So now I guess I should be searching for matches but I don't see what's the use
Engines run 'till they're out of juice
And I can't even produce

It's as if we've only ever come together just to test each other's mettle
Or to justify subsistence or bolster our resistance to the idea that we should struggle
When we could just settle 

So you just get numb to every itch
And there's no feeling in your fingertips
And you can't find the switch
And we've grown much too tired to grope
Yeah, we lost all our fire to cope a long time ago

And you've never seen me there

'Cause I don't wanna be a homosexual

If other guys are gay
But my hormones are one-directional
And I don't wanna be a homosexual

Somebody tell me what I did to start this talk
Is it the way I look; is it the way I walk?

Is it the clothes I wear
That make the people stare?
Is it the way I comb my hair?

I'm only hoping maybe there will come a day
When I can make them understand that I'm not gay

But till that day is here
I guess I'll live in fear
And I curse the day I pierced my ear

What did the doctor think?
I swear to God I saw him wink

I pray that I am wrong

Why did I write this song

I'm gonna see a real professional

And later on I go to shop for clothes
And the sales clerk strikes a snotty pose
""Can I help you with those?""
I want him dead!

And every time I see that stuck up topless dancer
I only want her to grow old and die of cancer
Cause I wanna set a bonfire in her hair
See her fry in the electric chair
Cause that's how much I care
I want her dead!

And I ask myself well how can it be right
To wish these awful deaths on people day and night
But when I ask why that's the way that it must be
I only tell myself 'well better them than me'.

Cause it's not that I'm such an awful guy
Don't ask me cause I don't know why
But certain people must die
I want 'em dead!

Yeah, I wish they'd take a leap from a windowsill,
Or overdose on sleeping pills
Curiosity kills
I want 'em dead!

Everyone who's afraid to dance
And everyone who wears panters' pants
And the whole nation of France

Or slit your throat with a razor blade

With gigantic loads that my people come to love

Azurite, get down with it
Can't fathom these brothers fantastic
Uh, I heard you cry when I dipped that ass in some plastic
How could you master, you deal with rappin' bastards
Because you asked us if we could bring you fashions
Fascists, because we turn this rap shit into something tragic
I didn't wanna have to put you in some action
Uh, I know you asked but did you really wanna have it?
See, I 'cause havoc like a loaded automatic

How do you like me now nigga, you know my style say word
I'm from the city where we're known for slangin' pounds of herb
Getting dough is a must, and it's the money making it's yo
The never faking it's creating shit that's taking your ho
After the show you know I step up in the place

Won't catch me in tinted windows, might catch me on residential

My rhyme is universal like a elastic-uh
I hope you feel me like you feel your past-or

What did you practice you so used to babbling
See it don't matter 'cause we mastered this rap shit
Pockets get badder 'cause it's hitting so immaculate
You like the way it goes down when S attacks-it
It will get tragic when the S is on the mission

So listen, relax take a seat in the place it's living
living up to expectations and still, ripping
With rhymes and filling the chrome, dipping
Cruising the neighborhood is just local pimping

You knew that it was you, her and me
You tryna ""CB4"" you better ""Raise It Up""
Out of my crib take a cab
Cuz ""Conent Gardens"" is where they flatten your wig
This for a certain chick whose name remains ""Untitled""
This is ""2U4U"" and by you
Got sick and tired of going ""Forth And Back""
Arguing about paper stacks, told you to ""Hold Tight""
But you stayed tryna ""Get Dis Money""
Asked you where my dough, you said ""I Don't Know""
I know the sex was ""Fantastic""
It's the ""Thelonius"" when I'm boning chicks
It gets the mattress
Girl ""Tell Me"" if you want something you can just
Make plump and if so then keep your ""Eyes Up""
Now we buckwilding ""What's That All About""
""Once Upon A Time"" you was down now we falling out
Sweetheart we the ""Players""
You wouldn't understand if you bought Volume 2 from the bootleggers

Hoping one day it comes around
One day when I'm
The nigga gettin' money, gettin' cash, gettin' signed
Getting the fuck out the ghetto, cause I'm tired of crime
But it's a crime that I feel this fucking waste of time
But sometimes I feel like this shit here is a waste of time

Some freestyle shit",Fall in Love [*]
Slum Village,"[T3]
There I was sitting there looking, waiting
Waiting for the chance to get to date you
I'm saying, I'm sick of games, sick of solos
Sure need you around when its all those
Listen, I'm not saying this to offend you
But since the day I met you I knew I would bend you, over
Not saying its about that
Its about us bending like vocals on ill tracks
Classic, like a novel by Stephen King
Always resting by the revel where a social reign
Sex, its the farthest thing from my mind
I'm thinking how we get together like the starter line
Fiction, to all the ladies that want it real
A brief description on how a nigga might feel
This is, one page out a black book
This is, how it goes when its all good, sister

[Chorus: x4]
And back, forth and forth, back

[Elzhi]
Just keep the sun in my storm clouds
Appreciate you as a man I was born child, young
Looking for young girls to party with
Make your body shift, shake up your cartilage, women
I wasn't satisfied with just one
I'll rip your valentine and having time adjusting, its hard
I thought not a soul could change me
You honor roll, I was down with hoes in grade see, level
I guess there is roses in the ghetto
Gotta find them, always meet the dozen not he diamond, coal
Been supportive now my days shorter
When they was longer dealing with the side effects were calmer, mistakes
I tripped over in my early days
Making the skies over few look a pearly gray, dirty
Until you came along and laid it on
I'll stick with you even if my man say its wrong, for real

[Chorus: x4]

[Baatin]
Since its my last joint I guess I gotta put it down
For the queens who fiend for the kings who come around
I want to extend the jewels to the crown
Behold you are soul that is lost never found
Still a virgin cause you untouched
Fucking around with low-life niggas, getting fucked
You need a king to put it down right
I know you want something that's more than just a one night
Stand tall never fall for the less queen
Naive niggas with tired ass raps stuck in his dream state
With his truck and his real estate, fell for the bait
Not knowing he's trying to change what's sealed in his fate
Just a mouse looking through a crack
Of the gates to a soul never coming back
Cultivators never laid to realize self
And when its done the queen of queens will complete your wealth

Rubbin' your feet in a luxury suit
Make sure you come with nothin' on just a long shearlin'
And I'ma make ya toes curl up like they are earlin'

I'll whisper in your ear, tell ya something
Stick my tongue in ya bellybutton
Reach down below, ya know I'm well sprung
Hit ya from the back to get ya calfs tremblin'
And pull ya hair 'til it's straight, you'll look half Indian

Laughing, giggling with champagne bubbles tickle ya nose
Before you I wouldn't throw my old nickels at hoe's
I'm just glad we can get close, for breakfast in the mornin'
We can fly out to Paris France for the French toast

You made me wait so long and that's a good thing
Now let me make ya candy rain' dampen your thong
I hit it off like a champion strong, for real
Your still bumpin' and grindin' even after the song but all along I, I

Ya lookin' good girl, I hope you into sex
Sort of a model type with a splash of innocence

And if we get it on I'ma take her back to the fort
Show her how I run game like an athlete in sport

Been doin' this for a while no need to explain it

If your man front, than we gotta knock the nigga out
Smack the nigga up, stomp the nigga out, clap clap the nigga up

Yup, so I'm steppin in his house
If the nigga step up I'ma knock the nigga out
So I'm here with a beer and a glove
With some thugs and some chicks with some derry' ass

I ain't scared with my dudes and I come prepared

Where the ladies at, pushin' back you Baby Phat
Make it clap like eight gats
Stayin' at the Infenium, just use the key
You got a man, but what your man gotta do with me
He don't want it, nah, he don't know the nigga
Roll with Dreadknotts, Cardy boys, and a mil', phat killas
Raw CD twelve, but don't mind that

And she don't like how you treated her anyway

Yeah, you said you love, but is it really real
Would you break me off first, and let my nigga Phil hit you
Picture my Caddy truck, we sexin' in the backseat
Or in my room, you bucky naked in my black mink
Girl, it's either 'this or that', like it's Black Sheep

Then I creep to the mo, with a freak on the low
Then I come through the doe, then I mash on the flo

Keep serving these yo's with the bad tenancies
Let a nigga do his thang, shit stop sweatin' me

Came through, made moves to get the crowd up

Together again like armed forces on some Fantastic Four or Four Horsemen

Passed and switched it up like kids in double dutch
Some couldn't feel our style or feel flow
Never talked our slang, never walked our road
All they know is these niggas is tainted
Don't know about those rovers that candy painted
We've been miss quoted, miss construed, miss understood, and over used
So we take this time to set the record straight
Critics skipped and did it anyway
Now you hear our raps wit Dilla and you all on our team
Till you heard 'Tin was gone was apart of the scheme
See! We still got love where was you at at?
Just cuz a nigga go solo think we turn our backs
Maybe we will reunite on some shit like that
But I gotta set it straight 'fore you twists the facts nigga

I wrote a verse that I recited it was hot
But I had to rewrite cause I thought we was united and we not
But though all the love that I got for you
Partna I picked apart ya words and I'm shocked in the interviews
I been accused of not carin'
When the city threw your furniture out
Its not fair when I'm learnin about how stress you fell in a article
Forget a rhyme I'm just as real when I talk to you
And you know that we share Kodak moments
I wish we could go back
But don't act like you wasn't bugin out like a phone tap
Chasin' cars in the street
I saw you throw up hard in the sink
Then after hit the bar for a drink, who asked you to slow down?
Even though niggas told me you was gon' clown
But I tried, and you know I cried when I saw you wild'n at the State Theater
In the door by the side
Throw you in the trunk and found a preacher for you
Cause I thought you had unlawful demons on you
Sinkin fast in the deepest soil
Ya parents finally got you some help
You came out seemin normal and
I heard you on medication
Had a illness you couldn't heal with herbs and meditation
And believe me; Me and T, Three kept it low
Don't take this as a dis this is just to let you know that I love you
But watch the company you keep

Yellin', niggas could hear us through the walls and the bricks
Sayin' what we don't mean
Stabbin' each other in the heart through the back
And actin' like the cuts just don't sting me neither
See the sun but the clouds make it smoky
You was my down chick when others just went down on me
Must've saw something in me to wanna birth my first
You changed my mind about raising a child on a earth that's cursed
Wonder where we went wrong when the thing's so right
When our future looked brighter than casino lights lit on the strip
In the bed you shocked me, bit on your lip
Sex was tighter than a leather outfit on a gimp
Was our feelins supposed to disappear the minute we kept, lost
Started out on a good foot then we eventually stepped off
Or is it just troubles that couples go through?
Mad on the phone can't hang up
But I'm hung up on you
Give me a call

[Chorus]

Are we in love?
Is it possible to have love within this relationship?
Cause now that I got the time
You should call me tonight
And I'll be alright oohh

Entice the moment of innocence
This how we came together
For better bon suited on how to break hearts
Separated then secluded 
Desire was a overwhelming conclusion
Those things of passion created a guard for the delusion 
It makes sense
In a mutual choice the muse 
And states of simple bliss forever we still here 
And in a intense climax the moment a miss 
And the moment of passion is intense enough to commence 
At last we in the depths of orgasm
The experience brought us this far
Now we out fast 
Take the time when expand emotions recommence to the intense
The second is innocence 
Guess the time when expand emotions to the 8 tenths 
A second of innocence, innocence

Sly & Robbie,"When you're in love
Some things you take for granted
Until someone pulls it apart
And leaves you with half of your heart
How do I trade 
The best I had for less
Without giving up
Should I slowly accept that we'll be no more than just friends

How do I know
When to let go
I know what I'm feeling inside
But part of me still wants to try

So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more

There's no winning bets
The battle's just begun
I know it's over
But I still feel the same
You'll always remain number one

'Cause letting go
More and so much
I know what I'm feeling inside
But part of me still wants to try

So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear

Sly & Robbie,"Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl 
With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there 
She would merengue and do the cha-cha 
And while she tried to be a star 
Tony always tended bar 
Across the crowded floor, they worked from 8 til 4 
They were young and they had each other 
Who could ask for more? 

At the copa (CO!) Copacabana (Copacabana) 
The hottest spot north of Havana (here) 
At the copa (CO!) Copacabana 
Music and passion were always in fashion 
At the copa they fell in love 

His name was Rico 
He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola, 
Still in dress she used to wear, 
Faded feathers in her hair 
She sits there so refined,and drinks herself half-blind 
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony 
Now she's lost her mind 

At the copa don't fall in love 
Don't fall in love",Copacabana (At the Copa)

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Sly & Robbie,"Rosalita, now our summer`s gone and you`ve left me all alone
You know I never expected, no I never suspected that
You came to me to seal my love away
You said I've always been a dreamer
`Cos dreaming is all I've ever done
Just like our summer, I thought it would last forever
But as the autumn came, you had gone away
All the promises you broke meant more to me than gold
Now I`m all all one in the heartbreak zone
And the winter will be cold without you
Rosalita, now our summer`s gone and you've left me all alone
You know I never expected, no I never suspected that
You came to me to seal my love away
You said I was a born loser
`Cos losing is all I've ever done
Like when I lost you, it proved that all you said was true
And now without you I feel I`m being used
All the promises you broke meant more to me than gold
Now I`m all all one in the heartbreak zone
And the winter will be cold without you my Rosalita
All there is left is a photograph
You smile and the ice cream`s meltin` down your pants
And I keep living on, you`re in the past, it`s been so long
Since the Ice Cream Summer, it`s forgotten now it`s gone
Rosalita, now our summer`s gone and you've left me all alone
You know I never expected, no I never suspected that
You came to me to seal my love away
Now you`re just a memory, don`t mean nothing more to me
A photo among others of my old friends and my lovers
And the winter is gone, a new summer`s coming on
A new summer´s coming on for you as well somewhere Rosalita","Sly & Robbie, the Kings of Dub"

Steal some covers, share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you

That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you.
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me

She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, Do I look all right?
And I say, ""Yes, you look wonderful tonight

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me, Do you feel all right?
And I say, ""Yes, I feel wonderful tonight""

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
I say, ""My darling, you were wonderful tonight
