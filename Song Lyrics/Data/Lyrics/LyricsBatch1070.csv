One Day,"They say we've moved too fast too soon
But your worries get washed away when lightning fills the room
Palpable sparks
Vision in dark
But when the sun pierces through you
It's making its mark
So don't get burnt
Any fire Imma quell it
Because I've learnt
I can be your umbrella
Your friends might care
I'll chill at the door
Just let me be there
And let it pour
No one can find out
I'm cool to keep it quiet for now
Just what we are about
I know it's gotta be raining for me to be around
And I hope that it pours down
I'll sit by window from dusk til' dawn
And Imma be around the first sign of a storm

Oh it's raining outside
Baby leave your windows open
There's no need to hide
'Cause they won't ever find out
If the water rushes in
Washes us clean

Oh it's raining outside
Baby leave your windows open
There's no need to hide
'Cause they won't ever find out
If the water rushes in
Washes us clean

Whatever we're doing or we about to do we gotta quit it
Got it
What if I caught your eye
Saw everything you stored inside
No reason to be mortified
I change seasons all the time
It's alright I promise
Goddess
You got us into this here
Straight and narrow before the arrow got us but
Honestly
Reciprocate my honesty
Stipulate what you want from me
Probably never be together
But you could make it better if you put it in a song for me
I think it's on for me
Love fools put bets on for me
See constantly
The self pity
I need to move cities
You need to move on from me
Allow me to be straight here
I never loved the rain like I had straight hair
Eight years
I've been with the man
I've been up the wall
What you crying for?
I've been with the plan
In a strangle hinterland
Twisted man

No one can find out
I'm cool to keep it quiet for now
Just what we are about
I know it's gotta be raining for me to be around
And I hope that it pours down
I'll sit by window from dusk til' dawn
And Imma be around the first sign of a storm

Oh it's raining outside
Baby leave your windows open
There's no need to hide
'Cause they won't ever find out
If the water rushes in
Washes us clean

Oh it's raining outside
Baby leave your windows open
There's no need to hide
'Cause they won't ever find out
If the water rushes in
Washes us clean

Oh it's raining outside
Baby leave your windows open
There's no need to hide
'Cause they won't ever find out
If the water rushes in
Washes us clean

Oh it's raining outside
Baby leave your windows open
There's no need to hide
'Cause they won't ever find out
If the water rushes in
Washes us clean

Oh it's raining outside
Baby leave your windows open
There's no need to hide
'Cause they won't ever find out
If the water rushes in
Washes us clean

Oh it's raining outside
Baby leave your windows open
There's no need to hide
'Cause they won't ever find out
If the water rushes in
Washes us clean",Leave Your Windows Open
One Day,"I cheat on every woman I've ever been with
Do you love me less?
I know this truth is stranger than fiction, girl
I must confess
I loved every woman I've ever been with with
But you knew the rest
Wanna get caught up in my mess
Well, be my guest, be my guest, girl

For me to explain my first line to ya
It's best to take you back to the scene of my first time
I was on Edith Street with a freak named Maddy
And a three liter cask of wine
Flowers in bloom, in her friend's sister's room
What's better than a girl who says 'yes' too soon?
Two of them
So I guess there lies the root of my problem
I float like the weather I never commit
But I ain't cheat on every girl I've ever been with
No I got your attention, riddle me this
Put your man up in a cab then sent me a kiss
Got your car nearby said where to you live?
Could go to yours, go to mine, wherever, you pick
Arrowheads through the bed man he never miss
Told her my room's a mess, said 'I bet it is'

I cheat on every woman I've ever been with
Do you love me less?
I know this truth is stranger than fiction, girl
I must confess
I loved every woman I've ever been with with
But you knew the rest
Wanna get caught up in my mess
Well, be my guest, be my guest, girl

She wanna mess 'round
But she don't want to get let down
Stretched out on my bed, be my guest now
Tell me, would you love me less now
You're well aware how I get down?
Whether pulling at your chair when we step out
Or pulling on your hair like you're stressed out
Shit, we've been everywhere so where now?
From here out, this we should be clear about, here me out
I used to keep an eye out like writters in the alley
But baby en pointe like the ballet, I feel like love
About to give her the keys a valet
And quit riding around like a Mustang Sally, but
Before we go too far
Girl you got to know I'm no shooting star
Mascara tears running down my path
I'll try to treat you right but you know what it's like

I cheat on every woman I've ever been with
Do you love me less?
I know this truth is stranger than fiction, girl
I must confess
I loved every woman I've ever been with with
But you knew the rest
Wanna get caught up in my mess
Well, be my guest, be my guest, girl

Now I was at the merch desk, tryna mind my own
Left my girl for another long night alone
Holed in a hotel, miles from home
My t-shirt soaked through with sweat
I just rocked a set, and if you'd like to know
Right now I'm feeling flatter than the battery inside my phone
When Miss Fly walks by with the flattery
Tryna challenge me to go head-to-head, toe-to-toe
Making eyes, touching hands and flirting
Baby girl, tryna put some work in
But I know one thing for certain
I want you, but I don't want to be that person
So, listen, vixen, I'm fixing to making a mistake
If I don't vacate up out of this place
Stranger than fiction, now she waits in the distance
It can all change in an instant

It's something that you do, to me
Got me howling at the moon
How you do, so come on in
Before you make yourself at home
You should know a couple of things, where to begin

I cheat on every woman I've ever been with
Do you love me less?
I know this truth is stranger than fiction, girl
I must confess
I loved every woman I've ever been with with
But you knew the rest
Wanna get caught up in my mess
Well, be my guest, be my guest, girl",Love Me Less
One Dead Three Wounded,"He said, ""I'm sorry for a sad farewell."" My heart is weak; it sways between the cynical and proud. I have to turn my back on you and all of this. This was a daytime promise and the sunlight bids adieu. Through virgin screams and guitar strings we bore the loudest son. His day has yet come. Screaming idly has never been my thing or sweating for fruit that labor does not bring. This is all for you my dear cynical son, the man who lit the match that burnt the whole world down. Farewell, to that basement noise the virgin games of girls and boys. Five men stand at the end of a long hard road facing a land where young hearts rule old heads, ""farewell"" we said, as our feet wrap around the edge. Dear Friend, ""I'll count my blessings when we hit the ground.""",Farewell
One Dead Three Wounded,"God damn these frightened, frigid hands and all our long forgotten plans. Clocks lie; we have no time and all. I won't deny you again, my friend. I was the one who betrayed you and Philadelphia is a ghost town without you. Our youth is dust on the side of the road. Let it bury the seeds of regret. Bury the seeds of Regret. Embed them in my chest. Let them grow to become. The bitter man I am.",Regret
One Direction,"You know I've always got your back, girl, so let me be the one
you come running to, running to, r-r-running
I see it’s just a matter of fact, girl, you just call my name
I'll be coming through, coming through, I'll keep coming

On the other side of the world, it don't matter, I'll be there in two,
I'll be there in two, I'll be there in two
I still feel it every time, it's just something that you do
Now ask me why I want to

It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do, do
From the way that we touch, baby
To the way that you kiss on me
It's everything about you, you, you (It's everything about you)
The way you make it feel, new, new, new
Like every party is just us two
And there's nothing I could point to
It's everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)
Everything about you, you, you (Everything about you)
It's everything that you do, do, do (Everything about you)
It's everything about you

Yes, I like the way you smile with your eyes other guys
See it but don’t realize that it's m-my loving
There's something about your laugh that it makes me wanna have to
There's nothing funny so we laugh at n-n-nothing

Every minute’s like the last so let’s just take it real slow
Forget about the clock that's tick-tick-ticking

I still feel it every time
It's just something that you do, now ask me why I want to

It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do, do
From the way that we touch, baby

It's everything that you do, do, do (Everything about you)
It's everything about you

And you have always been the only one I wanted
And I wanted you to know without you I can't face it
All we wanna have is fun, but they say that we're too young
Let them say what they want

It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do, do
From the way that we touch, baby
To the way that you kiss on me
It's everything about you, you, you (It's everything about you)
It's everything that you do, do, do
Like every party is just us two
And there's nothing I could point to

One Direction,"Girl I see it in your eyes you’re disappointed
‘Cause I’m the foolish one that you anointed with your heart
I tore it apart
And girl what a mess I made upon your innocence
And no woman in the world deserves this
But here I am asking you for one more chance

Can we fall, one more time?
Stop the tape and rewind
Oh and if you walk away I know I’ll fade
‘Cause there is nobody else

It’s gotta be you
Only you
It’s gotta be you
Only you

Now girl I hear it in your voice and how it trembles
When you speak to me I don’t resemble, who I was
You’ve almost had enough
And your actions speak louder than words
And you’re about to break from all you’ve heard
Don’t be scared, I ain’t going no where

I’ll be here, by your side
No more fears, no more crying
But if you walk away
I know I’ll fade
'Cause there is nobody else

Only you
It’s gotta be you

Oh girl, can we try one more, one more time?
One more, one more, can we try?
One more, one more time
I’ll make it better
One more, one more, can we try?
One more, one more,
Can we try one more time to make it all better?

One Direction,"Give you this, give you that
Blow a kiss, take it back
If I looked inside your brain
I would find lots of things
Clothes, shoes, diamond rings
Stuff that's driving me insane

You could be preoccupied
Different date, every night
You just got to say the word
But you're not into them at all
You just want materials
I should know because I've heard
When girls say

I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, and that's not me
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you

You've got everything you need
But you want accessories
Got to hold it in your hand
If I changed the world for you
I bet you wouldn't have a clue
Don't you know that I can't stand
When girls say

I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, and that's not me
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you

Oh, and all the girls say

I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, and that's not me
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you

Be loved by you
I wanna, I’ll stay true
I wanna, if you knew
What you put me through
But you want, you want, you want me to love you too

I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, but that's not me

(Na na na na na)

He takes your hand, I die a little
I watch your eyes and I'm in riddles
Why can't you look at me like that?

(Na na na na na)

When you walk by, I try to say it
But then I freeze, and never do it
My tongue gets tied, the words get trapped (Trapped)
I hear the beat of my heart getting louder, whenever I'm near you

But I see you
With him slow dancing
Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see
Whenever you
Kiss him, I'm breaking,
Oh how I wish that was me

(Na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)

He looks at you, the way that I would
Does all the things, I know that I could
If only time, could just turn back
'Cause I got three little words that I've always been dying to tell you

But I see you
With him slow dancing
Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see
Whenever you
Kiss him, I'm breaking,
Oh how I wish that was me

With my hands on your waist, while we dance in the moonlight
I wish it was me, that you’ll call later on 'cause you wanna say good night

'Cause I see you

Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see

I’m blinded, 'cause you are everything I see,
I’m dancin’ alone, I’m praying,
That your heart will just turn around,

And as I walk up to your door,
My head turns to face the floor,
'Cause I can’t look you in the eyes and say,

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight,
It just won’t feel right,
'Cause I can't love you more than this, yeah,
When he lays you down,
I might just die inside,
It just don’t feel right,

Would you lay down
In my arms and rescue me?

In his arms, I get weak,

I wanna feel your love
I wanna lay beside you
I cannot hide this

Heartbeats harder
Time escapes me
Trembling hands touch skin
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face

If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time

You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be
My love, my heart is breathing for this

I'll find the words to say
Before you leave me today

Close the door
Throw the key
Don't wanna be reminded
Don't wanna be seen
Don't wanna be without you

Like tonight's sky

Hands are silent
Voice's numb
Try to scream out, my lungs
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face.

Going back to the time
Playing games in the street
Kicking balls at my feet
There's a numb in my toes
Standing close to the edge
There's a pile of my clothes
At the end of your bed
As I feel myself fall
Make a joke of it all

He'd kill me without any warning

Would he hold you when you're feeling low

You've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly

I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
Maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me

I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

You never love yourself half as much as I love you
You'll never treat yourself right darling but I want you to
If I let you know, I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you oh

And I know just what she’ll say if I can make all this pain go
Can we stop this for a minute?

I see ascending light upon a hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed, still

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holdin' on so tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke, inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

And I've been waiting for this time to come around
But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds

The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm and time
Is frozen

The story of my life I give her hope (give her hope)
I spend her love until she's broke (until she's broke inside)

In her eyes there's no lies, no lies
There's no question, she's not in a disguise

Everybody needs someone around

Holding you in my arms

And I've got something missing tonight
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow
I wish I could be there now

I know you feel of that

Let me talk to you, baby, I'm digging your style
The way you lick your lips is like hmm, oww
You driving me wild with your sexy self
Your pretty little face got me hypnotized

All I wanna know, is you down to ride
I can open up the door and you could come inside
I could show you what life could be
I could show you it's just you and me

We can go to the mall, you can have it all
I can tell you're impress by the way I ball
One shot with you and I will trade it all
The girls in the shows, I talk about everything

Your touch is a beautiful thing
We can shine together like a diamond ring
I've been waiting for a girl like you
To come into my life and make my dreams come true

All I ever wanted was a girl like you
Someone I can give my heart to
All I ever needed was someone like you
Someone I can give my heart to

[Incomprehensible] papi, if I put you to the test
Would you differ from the rest
Or you wanna be my homey that owns me
And holds owns me only when you lonely, lonely ?

I'll inform you when I'm looking for a friend
Until then, I need a man to take a stand
Hold my hand, I'm just scared of situation, temptations
No hesitation when it comes to us

I got it with single touch
Doesn't take much, so baby, just hush
Trust, everything's gonna be okay
If you do it my way, my way

Hey, you wanna be with me
I'll fulfill all your fantasies, be the girl of your dreams
Holding you tight all through the night
You'll even love when we fight

All I ever wanted was a girl like you
Someone I can give my heart to
All I ever needed was someone like you
Someone I can give my heart to

We can do them things that lovers do
Or we can be friends and keep it cool

Go ahead, baby with yo' bad self
Looking all fine, lollipop in your mouth
Standing on the curve with yo' bad ass curve
One look, whoa and I had to observe

I let my eyes finesse you, my mind caress you
Booty like a tenderoni
If I could make you mine, you'll be my one and only
You make me say oh like Mister Capone

Just one look is all it took
Got me lost in your eyes
And you mesmerized by my lips
Hips and thighs, oh my, oh my

I'm riding by your side, high
Taking my time when I'm working that body
So [Incomprehensible] got you talking naughty
Oh yeah, can you feel it? Oh yeah

All I ever needed was someone like you

An airline ticket to romantic places

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The song that Crosby sings

While I wonder why my love ever said goodbye
The night was young
The breeze was warm and tender
A fool was I but how was I to know
I gladly gave my heart in sweet surrender
To learn that love was meant to come and go 
Like snowhite clouds floating through the night 
Speaking of a love that was heavenly 
A love that could never be mine
 
Once we were together and now we're apart
Did you find it easy to forget?
I keep on dreaming while the years go drifting by
Calling you my ""Sweet Regret""
 
Clouds floating thru the night 
While the silver stars above
Lend their tender light 
Clouds drifting thru the sky
While I wonder why my love ever said goodbye
The night was young
The breeze was warm and tender
A fool was I but how was I to know
I gladly gave my heart in sweet surrender
To learn that love was meant to come and go

Can you my darling, can you picture this?

Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom

Alone in a world that's so cold?

Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold

Maybe you're just like my mother

Feel how it trembles inside

Remember the times I sat on your lap
The way you'd always touch my knees

I feel your hands still touch my face
And all I wanted from you was to love me
For me to be free from you
I will be free from ... me

Now you fade away

One Self,"When I walked up all you caught was the shade of my hat on my face
My ways are in pain, from the strain of my ways
Chains engraved in my physical days, in physical waves
I get physical strength from my individual ways
Meanwhile I'm not fulfilled, this feeling shall not be stilled
Rewind time and rewrite lines for the kinds of you to feel
Docile if you so will, fragile and you go downhill
Drinking wine, forgetting time, now time to be refilled
They say if you snooze you loose
Well I spend my days, dazed and confused
Is it cause I blaze all day and fade, then that's old news
If it's new to you, this is Yarah rapping the blues
Don't get used to it, running mascara I refuse
Closed doors prevent outsiders from viewing
But struggling alone makes it tough for pursuing
Dreams, but it seems all I get are sleepless nights
Nightmares about losing loved ones and losing fights

The bluebird flew over the fields of sorrow
As I left the scene and the dream watching the souls wallow
Left you for more, left the room hollow
Many will fall, a lot more will follow

You take drugs to psyche your mind
You take wine, to forget about time
You create a world of your own
Where the truth, will never be known

I work when the work seems like play
And hate to play when the work seems to work my way, I say
I work my way through everyday that I play my way
Now..
Hear what I say, hear what I say
Makes it all seem hopeless like impending cancellations
The locks will open someday continued determination
Restless infection destroys spiritual vaccinations
And I will head for my destination
I stand alone at the crossroads of death inhale the breath
Of lost souls that left in and out of consciousness
Drinking wine reminds me of what honest is
Making me wonder where the hell the logic is?
We're all lost, we're all tossed, at a lost cause
Fight between ourselves, relieve ourselves, and then we all fall
Through the wall, through it all, who we are?
No denying that at 5 foot I still stand tall

The bluebird flew over the fields of sorrow
As I left the scene and the dream watching the souls wallow
Left you for more, left the room hollow

Aujourd'hui notre bonheur c'est quoi?
Détenir un bien qui n'appartient qu'à soi
Posséder ce que l'autre n'a pas
Toujours obsédé par ces mêmes rêves sans joie
Mais pourquoi?

On prend des bonnes résolutions
Mais en fait on change pas
(Où est-ce qu'on va?)

On veut la paix, l'amour, l'amitié
l'égalité, la santé, ouais ma santé, ma thune
Ma gueule et les autres on verra
Fais pas le faux c'est ce que tu te dis au fond de toi
Égoïste mais s'il faut être optimiste je peux
Si je picole je crois que tout le monde ira mieux
C'est ce que je veux mais y a rien qui change au 31
A base de cotillons à 2 balles essaierai de faire bien

Je veux croire que dans un excès
La scène m'appelle déjà mais
La mer en moi s'est levée
J'ai dû me délaisser

One Tree Hill,"I saw you dancing out the ocean
Running fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flying from your hands

In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Baby you're the one

There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel

For each man in his time is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long lost heart within his reach",One

Here with me today

I never thought what we shared could ever fall apart.

It's so bad we gave up a chance
Can't explain how I missed all this romance
We slowly fell out of touch (ooh ooh oh)
Cause I hurt so bad, I don't wanna be sad no more.

For the better, oh how I wish that they could
I'd never ask you to rearrange your life for me, hey.

One Way,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence","Pull Fancy Dancer/Pull, Pt. 1"

In the night, though we're apart,
There's a ghost of you within my haunted heart
Ghost of you, my lost romance,
Lips that laugh, eyes that dance

Haunted heart won't let me be,
Dreams repeat a sweet but lonely song to me

Dreams are dust, it's you who must belong to me
And thrill my haunted heart,
Be still my haunted heart

Only Crime,"Climbing on another one
Racing for the higher ground
We separate all the civil serenades
Into hollow sounds

And I'm yours
I'm waiting just behind your eyes
Weighed down a heavy heart
And a mind grown cold with lies

On time
Just when you get it
You brace yourself against the furthest fall
You'll never get it
Just like the rest of the starving millions
Find out on your own
The luck ones are the dead and dying
No tears or wasted lines
When it all wears through

A sick cell I'm not well
I feel things that I'll never tell
Keep slipping further from a space just south of sane

And you can see my skin crawl
While your face grows white
I'll destroy your world in a day
I'm gonna make your fuckers pay
It's all

All I've said and all I've forced
To pick you up to fix it all
We set aside our selfish goals
Thick as blood we lose control
Inside ourselves absolve all sin
The bravest shade surround and win
The wounds are dressed and it's said and done
No other side it's over

Trying breathing
Still we suffer all the same
We are bleeding

They're rising from Tartarus vengeance in their eyes
Power from below the earth from where all evils lie

Satan captor in his realm bound for 1,000 years
Evil, hatred burns inside vengeance fire from the skies

[Chorus]
The lord of evil he rides again
The lord of evil 1,000 years he was held a slave

Deep inside the depths of hell along the river Styx
Charon rows his boat of death around the burning pits
The advocate for Satan a worldwide death crusade
Cruel death fighting demons will rule the earth his way

Onslaught,"The gates of hell have opened wide with deadly speed the metal it strikes

Hit the switch the power's free it'll blow your ears",Onslaught (Power from Hell)
Onslaught,"Battle follows battle to the death to take the hill
Blackened leather warriors the chill as steel meets steel
One survives by cunning the other lives by might
The death defying warlords by the firelight they fight

With the power of steel they're raiding our land
They're marching from hell with the devil as chief in command

The morning light meets fire still the warriors they kill
They're pushing for the last attack upon the mighty hill
The brave know not of running 'till the last man they will fight
Just raise the steel up to the sky and sound the battle cry


With the power of steel they're raiding our land
They're marching from hell with the devil as chief in command

Here ends the final battle as the last defender fell
The proud and savage warriors have tread the path from hell
Battle scarred and weary but the sword still strong in hand
Strong in their defiance as they march across the land

With the power of steel they're raiding our land
They're marching from hell with the devil as chief in command",Steel Meets Steel
Onslaught,"It steps out of its vessel and stares in horror
This planet stinks it stinks of death

Thermonuclear devastation of the planet earth
Piles of rubble where cities once stood
Flesh decaying where men once fell

Piles of rubble where cities once stood
Flesh decaying where men once fell

Artificial disease strikes the visitor down",Thermonuclear Devastation
Onslaught,"The sound of horses riding by the riders fists raised to the sky
Burning torches the flames of death the suspects being put to the test

[Chorus]
In a different time religion's the same
The witch hunt is on as God's evil reigns

A pretty maid destined to die Lord's servants death in disguise
The evil spirit must be cleansed in the name of God they're claiming revenge

The morning skies they turn to night the maiden she's lost her fight
Chilling screams as she burns alive the Christians ride home satisfied

Onward,"Onward I walk, 
Alone and abandoned

Feeling the wind and the icy cold rain
Feeling each step, destiny hidden 
All to aware of the fear and the pain
Feeling the sting of true betrayal 
Now I have no one to trust but myself
I am now one, no more believer 
Yet there is still wind to fill my sail

A paradise I seek shall be found 
The only one I'll know
I challenge failure to cut me down 
Cause it's onward I shall go
My power strength shall never die
As long as I stay alive
One word shall always be by my side 
Ever moving onward!!!!

Battles I've won, 
The war I have lost 
My blood and my tears 
They are equally spilled
The risk I shall take, 
The feel of the cost
The prophecies of shattered dreams 
Now fulfilled
The specters they watch, 
I can hear them laugh 
Yet I will impale onto their doubting eyes
Victory due one of these days 
Revenge will silently 
Come all in due time

Onward on, never underestimate my force of will
Onward on, never I will hesitate to know 
That I will fight!!

Onward I walk, with each step now close
But closer to something that might not be there
Using the rage, feeling the hunger 
The book that I read always has a new page
Come strike me down, take all that you need 
Resilience is my new found weapon of choice
Again I will rise, one day I will win
As long as I sing onward cry from my voice!!",Onward

Go downstairs, shake hands with her father
Say you need her back, no dad don't bother
Excuse me mister sir, but your daughter gets the rawest

It's not everyday you get to be a genuine witness

So take off your bra, show your breasts and move your dress
Yo what's the matter hooker, cat got your tongue?
Or do you want my tongue to get your cat and get you strung
I got the whip appeal, plus chains and bats
And always wear hats, for flippin in the puddy cats
Once it's in there's no turnin back
Move your feet, to your head, til you hear your bone crack
When bitches get dick they don't know how to act
And once you go black, you never go back
I don't discriminate and just leave it at that
I'm just one, stinky kinky, slim not slinky
Fiddle with your clitoris then pop your pussy with my pinky
Tryin to get yours, I'm tryin to get minor

Titty strangler, rougher than a Wrangler
Guaranteed to make em bleed they need paper satisfaction
Big butt cheeks the funky breakbeat action
Leavin the hoes, smackin the hoes, leavin em on the subway
Lost without a care but can't walk cause that ass is broken
First date, veteran, better than a nympho
Sleek to the beat cause I be fuckin on tempo
Train like a trolley, lick her like a lolli
I smoke more cheeba than motherfuckin Bob Marley
Lady persuader, big panty raider
Four times a week I get stuck on the elevator
La la, live to die
Tricked on this slick and went way past her why
Jack B. Nimble, Jack B. Quick
He got too slick, now he got a sick dick
Cause I don't really really give a fuck
Praise the Lord, cause even nuns get stuck
Never play me like a burger, I'm never double cheesy
Easy Rider or writer, stinky never fighter
Try to get yours, cause I know I'm gonna get minor

My girl lips locked a niguz cock, like a popsicle
Quick - my man flipped the silencer tip
Now let the dumb bitch go to hell, and suck on the devil's dick
Yep, you knew money felt the chill
He should have ate that pussy then it coulda been his last meal

So don't make me angry; you won't like me when I'm angry

Hit between the eyes, I plan to vandalize
I supply the static, I run with the bad guys
The villains, crooks, highlighters and the fighters

One had a link, the other a goose
You know what we took, and you know what we left
But the third one played a punk he dissed his posse and stepped
With Sticky on the loose, there was nothin' he could do

You want the truth?  you couldn't handle the truth!

And if nobody speak up, then I'll lead my people
'cause two wrongs don't make it right, but it damn sure make us equal
I'm incitin riots, so let's start the lootin
And whoever enforce the laws I guess we'll just got to shoot them
Cause in this revolution I loathe my enemy
I'm agnostic plus I got no identity
So lovers of life don't keep your hopes up high (why?)
'cause it's just a matter of time before it's your turn to die
But until then, when you stop breathin
It's time to stand up and fight for what you believe in!!!!!

evil stalks and lurks
dominate and do worse in my dwelling
niggaz filling shells and compelling to bust melons
(we just) bring to these fellas

[chorus 2X]
These evil streets iz rough
ain't no one we can trust
either roll with the rush or get rushed
cause all we got iz us

these evil streets...

Verse 2:
Seen the world through the eyes of a nigga on the brink
drugs got my brain fried making it hard to think
I'm trapped in these evil streets
drivin some scuffed up ragged down beat up past tims
some kid pulls up with chrome dimple guided rims
now I'm thinking its 3 in the a.m.
I'm walking and he in a BM
drop top 3-he don't even see me
would you believe, he saw my gun in 3D
10 blocks later trying to work the cd
spotted 15 on the BQE
cause ain't no way them pigs is baggin me
and up a Sonsee we official nasty

For niggas that force the issue
my man'll toss the pistol
and of course I hit you
let that loss be with you
the more L's the higher
streets are fire
make ice hearts in men
for worldly desire
its the black attack
born on the corner
nigga grew up fast to get that looter ready to shoot 'er
and he do anything to achieve it (better believe it)
grew up in a band of thieves
who retrieves the goods
stacking stacks
and pushing niggas shit back like they should
while we was gone
some shit undeveloped
now parlay, sit back
and watch armys swell up
yeah....punk niggaz

[chorus x4]
As we move through these evil streets...

Verse 3:

Only nigga that can kill me is the nigga in the mirror
but when I cup the mic and make my fighting words clearer
a nigga without a gun is like something is missing
that was my employer-when I ain't have a pot to piss in
(so listen) keep a gun, even if its not needed
better that than to have none and to be in deep shit
We mold on niggaz like Bacteria grows
fools they lucky if they walk away with a black eye and a broken nose
nigga, we kill niggaz
for Polo and Hilfigers
its all for real ill niggaz
and steel figures
ain't nothin over here
won't be soft
shit be jumping off
on the rag
don't beat me in the head with that
go head with that
I think back me in my mans rover
rip out sombodys grandmother
pulled out, the bitch ran for cover
keep niggaz guessin with our face without expressions
for niggaz stressin
I leave a lifetime impression
it shines like aggression when the flame comes out
saw the bout, what you got, when your gang runs out
shits hot, you could get burned with heat
we take turns to sleep
you better learn the street
knowledge
damn, you could get shot for 5 dollars
its live wires
with no signs of survivors...

[chorus]
These evil streets iz rough
ain't no one we can trust
either roll with the rush or get rushed
cause all we got iz us
These evil streets iz rough
ain't no one we can trust
either roll with the rush or get rushed
cause all we got iz us

I'm a tyrant
strinking like a viking
a knight in shining armor
jumping for the sauna
the rough rhymer
suicidal like Nirvana
the end of your world is just beginning
there's no winning in my inning
the dead things cannot effect the living
so I trip into the wind
of the ghetto bad weather
I'm lost in the desert, but the storm blows me on
never talk to a stranger
everybodys in grave danger
me and my people just shot ya anger!
FUCK DAT...YA BETTER OFF DEAD!

Considered less than a god, but more than a man
I can knock down a mule like conan the barbarian
with my mental powers and my sixth sense
that can raise a dead crowd into a live audience
(so get the fuck out the way)
ooh, and get your ass cut
cause if you go to jail they probably make a pussy out ya butt
(no doubt)
here's the clip witches know its a black stone
its a matter that shatter your track bone

Verse 3:

Cover me, I'm going in
move em in take em out
the time when niggaz seem to always fight and lose a battle
its too late to pray I'm selling one way tickets to hell
no one tell is what you punk niggaz yell
like-wah wah!
that's the sound of your bitch ass hurtin
black start attackin back-I'm still hurtin
Sticky come on come on well...

So all let up on the fact
that I'm a nigga that can just beat your mother fucking ass
to hurt your feelings
cause your shit is trash
too many people like me
cause they're not worthy
destruct my coalition
its a demolition derby
through all that spit you talk
and make the mic smell like saliva
yick! you need to retire
resign
I'm ahead of my time
in my prime
one of a kind
and out of my mind!
and ain't nothin in this world free so me I'ma kick a pay style
I don't got no smile I was abused as a child
my moms gave birth to a crazy ass wilder
bust out her pussy with a mother fuckin gun
started talking slang
even joined a gang
the suicide scums
I sold jums to the bums
I was the hand to hand man pullin in clubs
then I started dealin
robbin and stealin
if not for killing then I'm known as a villain
if you want problems I'm ready and willing
and I'll get up in your mouth like a fucking filling

Onyx,"We roll a hundred niggas deep and not one of y`all got a gun
I bust one shot, you see a hundred niggas run
So sit on black gortex, before test, we all wore vests
I`m takin' all bets, to see who will score next
I burn you like floor sex, you just a small threat
Wit a small set, so forfeit, I rhyme for more checks
'Cause whatever that it takes to make these papes, I`ma walk this
I`m worthless, I`m back to sellin' cracks behind the trenches
I`ma hurt this when I work this, I`ll beat you fuckin' senseless
Deep and other bitches got me swingin' at the fences
I bring it down like gravity, wit the getto mentalitee
To rule the oddity, the official nasty on the strategy

The city never sleeps, so don`t sleep on us
I put niggas to rust, when my gun bust and plus
You get rushed, and when the press is on, you just been checked
You had plans on conquerin' this, you need to switch up
Get up, nigga you should of got up
Obey my orders, 'cause shit like that`ll leave you shot up
For real, it`s a deadman`s party, leave ya body at the door
A loss for lechery, my introduction to the century
And entity, is what I plan to be in the industry
Enemies in my vicinity, get assassinated like the Kennedy
My gats the foolproof remedy

It`s Sonsee, black and blue, the bad news off the pocket
Look like tacky, attack me, you get splashed
Official nasty backwards, sue, what the fuck is rule, you dumb ass
Trynna put shit on our name, you gonna get numb fast
Rap in the street, to do without ya
While I haul off and snatch four shit out ya
Look and see my image again when you start hemorrhaging
And damn, it`s cloggin up, the blood he didn`t smell
The masses, disastrous, plenty closed caskets
And asses, when I turn, we burn crews to ashes
Niggas take the simple, so get gassed up and smashed up
That`s my word, and come wit that bullshit and that`s ya ass

Just slayin' emcees, and makin' niggas freeze
And all of these lyrics for to squeeze
Niggas please don`t test me, just let me be
Wit my City, the Nasty, Official and keepin' niggas whippy
To hit me, wit the Valentine, forties and bag the bad shorties
I got drafted, because the fuckin' Armee called me
And it`s all out war, niggas fall out
For reasons that`s now unknown, check this shit
I got the illest, the realest, hard for kids to kill us
Until it`s, my turn to fall, I`ma bill this
Brick wall, to keep the crabs out of my sector
Inject the, and now correct the J Mega

The hell wit rules, I won`t leave a scratch to patch
This is war, way worth of a grudge match
Big P.I., low uphold a, a Universal soldier
Chump should of listened when I told ya
I`m ill, like fire moms you will, obtain
Flip bombs and peal, lyrics burn like acid rain
Holdin' the gutter, buck wild, for offerin' butter
I`ma thug, I used to love the drug rubber
Rugged and raw, pretty 'cause I`m hardcore
All Mighty then Thor, always ain`t it for a faggot jaw
So hard rocks and fillin' flocks, clear the block
My mic`s a glock, I keep plenty styles in stock
The way emcees react when I attack
Get me away from him, he`s a maniac

It`s pure you see, I bring fame
They call me Nigga so much, startin' to think it`s my name
Light skinned and a shame, 'cause way back in the day
They rapped my grandmother`s mother`s, when they was in Spain
To help my grandfather, he be misbehaved
But my ancestors was brave, and most of them real
Stronghold brass, forty slain workin' in the field
But a hundred years later, I learned about my roots
And how they traded in there white sheets, for badges and blue suits
So I`m takin 'recruits, and shut the fuck, it`s on right
And start a fight, a fight, a nigga and a white
And if a nigga don`t win, then we all jump in

But factual react, if frontin and fakin jacks, it's all a sudden
But there better be no proscratin, wit reaction when ya rappin
'cause when you maxin and relaxin, that's when they start attackin
So get the gats, forget the facts, and like there's no compassion
Kick me, 'cause I'm a daisy street, as cold as the Alaskan
Bought my braids, bought my hat, and Staten stay stackin

I like to start trouble, 'cause I'm a little rowdy

So all of ya, frontins bad for ya health
'cause in the 93, my army goin for self
Kids is cruel, more causin then these fucked up conditions
That we all hate, but fuck it if this our fate
Just listen up to what I say
The feds get shot daily, every day
Even my man got killed, that was families mournin
But from all the dirty bid, I know that hell is callin
Went to his wake and shit got held up
But niggas wit mask on they face
I couldn't escape, I was stuck
They said ""Everybody in here, up against the wall
The dead nigga owe me money, so I'll collect from y'all""
The people gave him struggle, 5 minutes went fast
When I said ""I ain't givin ya nigga shit, I'ma just have to get blast""
And representin wit my life, I'm full fledged thief
And I'm the truth, that's why we always have beef

Yo shut 'em down start the violence
We wilin' wilin' sling back his body found
Washed up on Coney Island
When I rolled up  this niggas heart slowed up
That killa froze up, when I pulled up jumped out with the pump-pump
Thirty-two shots and ducked out
So look out
Left that cat for dead his body smoked out
Cause when I fall y'all killas a kill me kid
I'm goin' all out
Lifes a bitch, fuck it, got the gun bust it
Game play, gotta play by the rules or your own cannot be trusted
Don't try to test, abide your chest, put five inside your vest
Have you layin' with a dead rest
Shoulda known when you was lookin' in the eyes a death
And I swore forgiveness when I did this
There was not no witness but he should understand
Cause even God got a shit list

Beat downs anonymous
I spit like a shiny silver nanabus
Niggas fond of us
We the kind that rush, those that hold back
Takin' your whole stack
Grimy street cats
Niggas bald head like Kojak
Go gat for gat
Coat that
You could smoke that
Or cut black dust
Makin' your whole fuckin' stove crack
Betta know me
1-3, one and only could be never phoney in any ceremony
I'll tear you homey
Shut 'em down
Shun sees takin' your time
Makin' your mind
Got this nigga on the low
Defecatin' with rhymes
Breakin' your spine
Got you movin' from the flurry, time to worry
I'm a bury the bullshit
Feel my full clip

Shut 'em down

Hey yo I bet you this motherfuckin' double barrel will blast his face
Be on the look out for a basket case
Niggas pumped you up to watch you get beat
Had you thinkin' shits sweet
Now you up shit's creek
Cause your shits weak
How mich is your life worth to someone important
Cause I be extortin'
Kidnap for ransom is some shit you don't want to get caught in
From back in the days of Gordon
Niggas was gettin' robbed
The guy from Rikers Height stayed on his job
With his own little mob
Was it worth goin' back to the Earth so soon
Worth makin' my shit go boom
To your own doom, from the graveyards
Till there's no room
Fuck you know about a pine box
Money goin' out with nine Glocks
On top of that same nigga when they pull with they nine shots
Feel like killin' for your crew
I ain't gon' rest
It gonna take a whole lot to put up your best
Then watch your loins spill out your vest
You best get on some act your age shit
You a little kid
That run for faces
More niggas get killed like that

Mad man Sticky F-I-N-G-A-Z
The crazy cajun blazin' bullets for days and days
Grazin' amazin' I'm the glazin' ason purple hazin'
Hard to be pahsin' Lord with all this hell I'm raisin'
God of the Underground, I'm gunnin' 'em down with a thunder pound
We gonna shut 'em down
We turn shit dumb quick gun click
Lyin' in the vine
Pursed the line on your dick
In the morgue admit it dogs
I'm the Rottweiler my Glock holler
Fuck cocaine killer I sniff gun powder
So all you real willies throw your Roleys in the sky
And all the crooks rob the place outside

Hear to make moves, get mines automatically
Emphatically, rhyme master, rapidly tragedies
Guns like Butch Cassidy, nasty like Dick Dastardly
As I be gradually (distorted) like (gunshot)
Glowin, blowin, flowin, goin, fast at it like Jesse Owens
Make you throw in, the towel, I will
Do all sorts of moves through all sports
Rhymes blew all thoughts, all crews to dust, it's us
Official, Nastee, the aggy still ghastly
You triple S nigga, soft sexy and sassy
We crash, I break your cast, and yes, we get busy
I'ma do my show, get my dough, and lick titties
I'm shitty, I diarrehea on the globe
Fire flee up on your clothes
And like 'squito up on your hoe
In case you didn't know, I stay free flow

Twenty more holes, in your Nautica, FUCK ALL OF YA!

Livin like a nigga with six months to live
On the edge of life, wouldn't think twice, to make a SACRIFICE

So bring your wildest nigga reppin for your team
Tear his ass to his spleen, this is Suicide Queens
Where gats bust, cutthroat, cross collateral
Gat'll shatter you, feel the pain, it's unimaginable
Self shit, straight from the hood, the dirty black shit
Rap shit, get your back ripped, plus the gat spit
Load it and cock it bag, on thirty-two tracks
Murder you in raps, let my wild dogs bust the CATS!

And when I die, be handcuffed, to my deathbed

Sticky Fingaz sneak up, when you least expect it
I never fuck pussy that's yeast infected
Fuck a brain fry, make me think irrational
If I even think you schemin, YOU KNOW I'M BLASTIN YOU
I'm too raw; what is you - out you gourd?
I cut through any challenger, top notch or amateur
You'd rather be in the projects butt-ass with a hundred G's cash
and no gun, than to fuck with Sticky, Fredro 'n Son
You lookin at one desperate nigga, you shouldn't mess with
I had a doctor scared to remove a bullet from yo' intestine
'Member when I tested, this nigga manhood
to see if he was a true nigga, so I pulled out my gun
Gave some dramatic ass speech then, pulled the trigger
{*CLICK*} Ha hah! Barrel empty, joke on you Jack
He cold pissed his pants, blew his cover, he a New Jack
You know where I'm comin from, most my niggaz pump 'n jump
And when it's time to dump and run, I never jump the gun
or get cold feet, I hold heat
why'a niggaz don't know me; in six hours I made up four years
Got high shit for your ears;
sorry somethin that I never felt yo, fingertips made of Velcro
You talkin shit like it's a little game
That's now how we get down - 'beef' is my middle name
So don't die over nonsense, I ain't got no conscience
Come out your face you gettin shot
Everything I'm spittin hot - I need fame without the bread
like I need a hole in the head
Add insult to injury, you can't fuck with me
Guess that's not your cup of tea - I'm every star I meet
If you are what you eat, fuck the rookies, rejects
plainclothes and detect's
I had a hard life, grew up too quick
But kept it tight with my true click, startin a new flip
Fuck you frontin for?  I seen your bag
with your tail between your leg
Afficial Nast in the house that mean you DEAD!

You takin a RIDE, in the ambulance, you catch mad damages
Cock the hammer shit, leave you Los(t) like Angeles

Whatever you got, get taken away, YOU'RE BAKIN TODAY

Hit you with the FIREWORKS, you see the stars BANGIN
I really BANG YOU, and prepare you for God's ANGELS
It's not on humble, but some shit you can't come through

Yo it's too often too hot, in this ghetto meldin' pot
Put out these fagat ass niggas try to steel what I got

With AlphaStation of lyric lacin, for all occasions
Engagements and events, for big dollars and cents
Makin niggas past tense, it's consequence
All I see around me, makes up the place
But if you don't hold down your space, you quickly get erased
Don't waste, a thought, thinkin
I ain't gon' be bringin the guns that grants hole
To my body, dead and stinkin
Watch as I back draft, on the last glass, and trap crash
Catch the hash blast, when I puff the black wrath
Learn the tricks of the trade, to be self made

Onyx,"Straight up nigga
Motherfuckin' Southside nigga

Brooklyn what!
We gonna do it just like this man
Straight to your whole area
(Word up, word up)
Yeah, yeah
You know what we fin' to do
Shut 'em down, shut 'em down
Yeah
(Yo word up, yo)
It's time to take over the world!

Shut 'em down, shut 'em down, shut 'em down
Shut 'em down, shut 'em down, shut 'em down
Shut 'em down, shut 'em down, shut 'em down
Shut 'em down, shut 'em down, shut 'em down
(Official Nast', I'm tired of these yo, yo, yo)

Shut 'em down start the violence we whylin' whylin'
Slain rapper's body found washed up on Coney Island
When I rolled up this nigga heart slowed up, that killa froze up
When I pulled up, jumped out with the pump-pump 32 shots and ducked out

Then I broke out, left that cat for dead his body smoked out
'Cause when I fall out, y'all killas got kill me kid I'm goin' all out
Life's a bitch, fuck it!  Got a gun, bust it!
The gameplay, gotta play by the rules of your own cannot be trusted
Don't try to test, abide your chest, put five inside your vest

Have you layin' where the dead rest
Shoulda known when you was lookin' in the eyes of death
Asked the Lord for forgiveness
When I did this, there was not no witness
But he should understand 'cause even God got a shit list

Yo it's beatdowns anonymous, I spits like a shiny silver nine'll bust
Niggaz fine to bust, we the kind that rush
Those that hold back taking your whole stack
Grimy street cats, niggaz baldhead, like Kojak

Go gat for gat, quote that, in fact you can smoke that
Uncut black dust, making your whole fucking skull crack
Better know me, one-three, one and only
Could be never phony in any ceremony, I'll tear you homey
(Shut 'em down!)

Sonsee's taking your time, making your mind
Baddest nigga on the low defecatin' with rhymes
Breakin' your spine, got you movin' from the flurry time to worry
I'ma bury the bullshit, feel my full clip!

Shut 'em down, shut 'em down, shut 'em down
Shut 'em down, shut 'em down, shut 'em down
Shut 'em down, shut 'em down, shut 'em down
Shut 'em down, shut 'em down, shut 'em down

Aiyyo I bet you this motherfuckin' double barrel'll blast his face
Be on the lookout for a basketcase
Niggaz pumped you up to watch you get beat
Had you thinkin' shit is sweet

Now you up shit's creek 'cause your shit's weak
How much is your life worth to someone important? 'Cause I be extortin'
Kidnappin' for ransom is some shit that you don't want to get caught in
From back in the days of Gordon niggaz was gettin' robbed

The guy from Rikers Height stayed on his job with his own little mob
Was it worth goin' back to the Earth so soon?
Worth makin' my shit go boom [Incomprehensible] your own doom?
Fill them graveyards 'til there's no room?

Fuck you know about a pine box? Money goin' out with nine glocks
On top between that same nigga when they pull out spray nine shots
Feel like killin' for your crew? I ain't gon' rest
It don't take a whole lot to fill up your vest

Then watch your lungs as they spill out your chest
You best get on some, act your age shit
You a little kid that run for faces
More niggas get killed like that than a little bit

Ay man Sticky
F I N G A Z the crazy Cajun blazin' bullets for days and days
And grazin' amazin', I'm the guy that's lacin'
Purple Hazin, hard to be phasin', Lord, all this hell that I'm raisin'
God of the Underground, I'm gunnin' 'em down with a thunder pound
We gonna
(Shut 'em down!)

We turn shit dumb quick when the gun click
Lyin' incubine pursed and lyin' on your dick
In the morgue admit it dogs I'm the Rottweiler my glock holla
Fuck cocaine killa I sniff gunpowder

So all you real Willies throw your Roley's in the sky
Now all my crooks, rob them players outside!
I'm so hype, I'll take yo' life, better have my dough right
And fuck five mics, I don't need no mic!
What? Bring it! Shut 'em down!

Shut 'em down, shut 'em down, shut 'em down
Shut 'em down, shut 'em down, shut 'em down
Shut 'em down, shut 'em down, shut 'em down
Shut 'em down, shut 'em down, shut 'em down

Seem like the only thoughts would be negative
But shit, I'd never give, I need a sedative
I'mma forever live, the one and only, murderer
Defeat, I never heard of that
Push ya head, throw the back, gettin that, word to gat
The most coatable, a number two of niggas when there's a show to do
You know the true Official Nast niggas, I blow a hole in you
I'm sellin tracks not cracks, you buyin or what?
'cause I be in your crib right now, tyin you up
Corams jack ya house, put the gat to your spouse mouth
And clean the place, kill the kids, do they see my face?
It's the cream I taste, he thinkin my way, be the race
We the mischief who raise the most hell
Onyx in the Bible, Genesis 2, verse 12
And that's the life, that I lead
Niggas walk around town like they can't bleed

When niggas sprayed the block, it's mad hot
Yo half the spot got locked
(What? Who got shot?)
My little nigga Bill from down the hill
We had a one through five
I heard he might not survive (Aw, damn)
He caught one in his leg
Two shots hit him in his upper (What?)
Part of his chest, two inches above his vest
Heard you next (I'm next?)
That's the word in the projects
(What? Them niggas ain't no threat
 They'll whole set'll get wet
 Yo go get the AK, and my two nines with the silencers
 And at seven thirty, y'all niggaz meet me at Veronica's)
Aight, no doubt, yo be safe, yo nigga I'm out

Yo yo Stick hold up, yo yo yo Stick, talk to Son

 With the same ones we seen at the strip arcade
 With the scar by his head}

Woke up the next mornin, couldn't hardly sleep last night
Oh shit my two nines is missin, wait somethin ain't right
Where the fuck that bitch go? Damn that hoe!
Wait, I know, that bitch in the kitchen praly makin me something to eat 
But still wearin my heat
Fuck it I'ma wake these niggas up so we can go hit the street
I went downstairs, couldn't believe my eyes
I seen Veronica with three guys twice my size
They all had guns but I was gatless
Last thing I saw was the kid with the scar
And then I seen blackness
Remember thinkin, how the fuck they know?

You want to bang nigga bang, fucking bang your set
want to play gun rap, I'll arrange ya death
My tech disconnect
Arms, legs, necks from chest
Shots split you
Rip through tissue
Raps most dangerous, ravenous
I'll leave the booth covered with remains of shit
Put the four-five blitz on the dot six range
Ice your frame and hang ya banger by his chain
This is Crip talk, Blood New York
Blow ya brains in your hand, nigga hold that thought
From outta the dark
Niggas get money from gat dealin'
Dead rappers body get found in back of buildings
We started this shit
We the heart of this shit
Onyx motherfucker, hard as it get
We at war so wha-what
Get your arms up
Nigga front, get your whole projects barked up

Chorus

I got a million niggas, cockin nines
You don't know us kid, you better hide your shine
And if you see a nigga with jewels on his neck
Stick em up, Stick em up, Stick em up
Back on the scene, gun with the beam
All you see is white, turn you red for the green
Niggas better move, Onyx coming through
Every track I'm on I turn black and blue
I can't, come from the head, I come from the heart
I shit hip-hop, nigga wipe my ass with the source
Ain't no nigga dead or alive fuckin with this
Need a second opinion? Ask your bitch
Walk through NYC to CPT
We 'bout blow up again like WTC
I changed the Benz sign to a crucifix
Onyx pull up with three 6's like six, six, six

Chorus

[Sonsee]
BLAOW! Techs up cause we bust rowd'
Shoot through your door
Watch bodies lift off the floor
Runnin' up the steps with a 100 shots gunnin'
Murder scene left so gross you can't stomach
My team built strong like steal bars in prison
twenty five to life, my brothers in hell biddin'
We bang on the charts, send flames to the top
Niggas move on your spot, take blocks
Bang to this
I blaze shit like an arsonist
It sprays the mist, to stack up your carcasses
What bitch nigga you get blast apart
Reppin O-P-M, till the casket drop

Where my wolves at?  Yeah
Put your hoodies on, keep your face down low
Anything shining, take that shit
Give a fuck, we in the bar
Niggas, bitches, let's go!

[Fredro Starr]
Aiyyo, set it off, let it off, get it off
Get this shit wild like thugs from up north
Fights in the crowd, the shots'll jump off
Body's on the floor, blood on the dance floor
Get stuck at the bar, get robbed at the door
Dropped off at the coat tag door, take it off
Get down, face down to the ground
Kill 'em for their doe like Po from uptown
Cut your finger off, send it to your moms house
Never testify no matter how it goes down
When I bark shots you niggas'll duck down
Run up on your block, you niggas get shut down
Give it up, you don't want to try to resist
Before I hit you off, you don't want to die for this
Un-unh, so we gon load our guns to this
Black mask, face down, motherfuckers gettin robbed to this

[Chorus 2x]
Take 'em out, bring 'em out dead
Take 'em out, bring 'em out dead
Take 'em out, bring 'em out dead
One gun, two gun, three to the head

[Sonsee]
Shots'll spill, niggas think it's not for real 
Make your body disappear like Copperfield
At the funeral's, don't waste no doctor bills
A lot of niggas ain't kickin shit I can feel
We gettin it down real big, that's what we doin
Give 'em the most raw, that's what we doin
The game don't understand, the world don't understand
These niggas is gun in hand, you die for these grand
Shot's from the magnum, killin the gats, smack 'em
You got it back, stab ya, with your own dagger
My sons take your 6, rope you in the closet (Hot one's!)
The one's that probably even pump the cops up
We got 'em strung with the drugs that we dealing
Or peeling, some loud niggas, thugs can feel us
And my Brooklyn killers, and my project niggas
And my brother's locked down in the jails can feel it

[Chorus]

[Sticky Fingaz]
If I don't eat, fuck that everybody starve
Takin your plate like it's food time in Oz
Motherfucker, I kidnap all your kids
Before I had a record deal, what you thought I did?
Last job I had I was punching a clock
Last nigga that I tied up was up at Koch
I ain't even need a mask, I ain't bust one shot
Made 'em wire me my money right there in the spot
That's a Coneay watch, nigga take that off
That's a iced out cross, boy take that off
Know what'd happen to your daughter if I don't make that call?
Better take me to the bank and get your face plucked off
Hottest nigga in the club cause I got the heat
So run boy, run boy, one gun box with me?
So step up young'n, show me you gon do
We got big guns nigga that go ""boom boom boom!""

Just to let you know this is recorded 9/11/2001
The day the World Trade Center blows up
Shit is real, son
Shit hit home, kid, word up
Hope you can feel this

[Chorus]
Hope you can feel me
(Hope you can feel me)
So much pain insii-ii-iide
Hope you can hear me
I'm crying through my heart

[Fredro Starr]
When I first heard the track it made me cry
Brought tears to my eyes and I don't even know why
My life ain't nothing but anger and pain
Tatoos on the back of my arm should explain
Blood, sweat and tears, ten years in the game
So many times all alone with the gat to my brain
It's me against the world nigga, I feel the same
I'm ""Ready to Die"" too Big, I feel the same
I'm America's nightmare - young, black and rich
Man, I'm paranoid, make me want to clap my bitch
A hundred miles an hour, want to rap my whip
Asking God ""Shit, where we going after this?""
I'ma thug, a thug til heart be stop
Til they pick me off the street nigga, murdered a shot
My wars, my words, the only thing that I got
And I live by the gun and I die by the glock
16 shots, fuck that I'm takin them all
I'd rather die on my feet then live and crawl
My gun got powers like the 48 Lords
The ""Ghetto Superstar"" die see my face on the wall, and don't forget me

[Chorus]

[Sonsee]
Growing up in Brooklyn, times was rough cuz...
Poor as we was it couldn't get no tougher
On my ave. most of us was not blood
But as kids we shared that block love
But that faded, when my brother's got arrested
They thugged on the block to hard, we was ejected
To the creator - was it you that made moms pick Queens?
So her baby son could race the world, when he created things?
Why her elders always heard the sounds of sirens?
Plus they ignored the divine guidance
Why was the time I was born 9/16?
Turn it upside down it's the same thing
Why do I have a M-16, and the 9?
Will I have to go out, blazing one at a time?
When you took moms baby carriage, in the early stage
Was he too ill for this world, and you made a mistake?
Did he come back ask me, to do something great?
To keep the fam strong and straight, help my brother's escape?
And have baby sis and us, living on an estate
Do it big, or die trying - is that my fate?

[Chorus]

[Sticky Fingaz]
Who really cares, what the world think about me?
If I die right now, is you coming with me?
When I'm broke, who the hell got money for me?
Can't even trust half the team running with me
I only know three people that'd kill for me
Break the sixth commandment, make blood spill for me
Life and death - the only thing that's real for me
'cause I was born into the world with a guilty plea
Now shit hit the fan, is you ridin with me?
When the whole world watching, all eyes on me
Swear on a stack of Bibles, testify for me
Look the judge dead in the face and lie for me
If I go to prison, who gon do my time for me?
Start the revolution, get the chair, fry with me
Go out in a blaze of glory, guns to the sky with me
I'm all alone in this world, all I got is me

[Chorus 3x]

Hope you can feel me...",Feel Me
Onyx,"You my wife with no papers
My gangsta bitch
The first time I got caught
You to shank the bitch

Ain't scared to get down
She'll bust off rounds
Smoke a Newport
Cut me half, bust me down

Catch me looking at anotha chick
She curse me out
Dead serious
But at times she act silly

Jump out the truck at the light
To get the dutch
Rolling it up
Chasing down ice cream trucks

I waited half an hour for your hair to get braided
She leaving dirty messages on three way pagers
Thought her how to roll cello and spit razors
She hit triple six first time out in Vegas

She never got shook when the Feds
Knocked down the door
She hid the coke
A scared chic would of flushed it raw

And we could live it up
Eat lobster and shrimp
Or get grimy with a
Quarter bag of potato chips

'cause it's straight gangsta
Straight gangsta
(Straight gangsta)
Gangsta

I need a down chic
That wouldn't mind loading the clip
And that wouldn't blow her mind
If I showed her a brick

In and outta the grind
With a focus for chips
Blowing for one time
With her controlling the weep

Re-up for me
And make sure she double the flip
She a sophisticated thug bitch
That move her hips

She catch you for your setup
When you move ya shit
But most of the time she throw
The cold shoulders to guys

Smoke in the ride
Hooded low
Over her eyes
She know she a dime

Baby nine strapped to her thighs
Gotta be live
Help me count doe in a five
And when I'm gone for weeks on them O.T. moves

She don't trip
She's a gangsta
She knows the rules
Giving me hell

That's not something I am hoping to loose
And God forbid, I slip up and land in jail
My murda mommy put the house up
To make the bail
(Come on)

'cause it's straight gangsta
Straight gangsta
(Straight gangsta)
Gangsta

Behind a real nigga
Is a real bitch
They lied to me
See my bitch

She walk right beside of me
I been in situations
Seen her ride for me
She lick my gun wounds

Even did my time with me
Ain't nothing she can't have
I get that girl everything
Tatoo our names on our fingers for wedding rings

Are you that chic?
Do you rep sticky?
We split it down the middle everything
Forty, sixty

Are you that chic for rich
Or poor?
The only one I eat out
The only one I hit raw

Keep you covered in ice
'Til you start shiverin'
Baby phat Gucci
Thugged out in pink timberlands

Me and her, we like Bonnie and Clyde
I hold the heat and the money and
She drive the ride
She make other bitches mad

'cause she more bitch
Than they ever been
It's the beautiful, intelligent
Talented, trama, heroin

'cause it's straight gangsta
Straight gangsta

Count bills with me
You'll kill for me
When the blood shed tears
You still with me

'cause you real with me
Smoke five with me

Well it's the S-T crocked I-see-K-why
Got ma ?? ?? doin' for sticks back in be  (?), K and why

The thuggest thug in the club, who else plays high?
Been in the game for years, it made me a criminal
Your small time, my rims is just as big as you
Iv never had a nine to five, I had a nine that hit people that got off there five
From those shiny things, that cut trough glass
Don't even speak to me, this is about sex and cash
I like ma cars, girls and clothes only for ma models
I beat you between yo head with thousand dollar arms bottle
Can't even with ice, I carry to much heat
The combination always leaves somebody wetting the street
I'm start sellin' hope trough ma arms of weed
'Cause I'm broke, only got three hundred grand on the bank
We back, bringing you that filth from filth
Let me stop talking before I criminate myself

I'm like B.I.G.'s first album, I'm ""Ready to Die""
It's Sticky Fingaz, if you didn't already know who I am
The minute I reached out and touched the whole hood with no hands
Cause in the streets I live through it, it's more than music
Whatever I'm spittin' on, I put my life into it
Got a reputation on the streets of keepin' it rough
There's just too many of us, you get rushed, you get bust - what!
Big trucks, chrome rims spinnin'
The mad faced niggas got money so now we grinnin'
Pull your sticks out, we the group you listen to, kid!
Niggas told me my music helped em' through they bid
I'm the voice of the ghetto, the heart of New York
A fiend will give his last hit, just to hear me talk
Niggas paid for their mistakes, death is the price
That's right motherfucka, Onyx for life!

Runnin the block like a runnin back duckin from d's

Side lines flooded with drops, cops is the ref
New York is like a contact sport, we play to the death
Money to floss, hos play off a nigga cost
Only rollin with the winners, not the team that lost
The game is wild, I'm like Ray Louis on trial
Flagrant fouls, hit with techs in the fort down
Connects get intercept for their coke in the first round
Be the game most rival thug, rhyme on thug
Blowin ya amps, Onyx is the Eastcoast champs

My team dirty, scuffed up timbs and black jerseys
Bulletproof pads, face masks and no mercy
Cooler full of henny and sprite for when I'm thirsty
I'm a sore loser, toughened up, learn to win
If a clip hold a hundred I'll put a hundred and ten
The game face bald head niggaz done it again
Celebratin, takin pictures out in front of the benz
And still we remain the champions
In dirty escalades, tinted up with fancy rims
And still we do the shit that can't be done

Onyx,"Nigga you heartless, you ain't heartless
You don't want no part in this, you ain't got it in ya
I'm born to be a sinner
As I move through these evil New York streets
Like grease and some kids get caught up
All up in the crime rate
Couldn't hold your nine straight when you was bustin'
Your whole clip and hittin' nothing

Your whole block on him, only two niggaz got him
Came down fast
With the cash and the product
Caught you pants down with ya clothes off

A nigga never knows
A nigga never knows

You got your rhymes niggas? Bring 'em, we start that
It's concrete combat, where I'm at a crime covered city
Where there's no time for pity, we comin' from the village
Of the unpriviledged, blood soaked bills through murder actions
Transactions all illegal, I smell the cheeb like a beagle
Evil stalks and lurks, dominate and do worse in my dwelling
Niggaz filling shells and compelling to bust melons
We just bring to these fellas

These evil streets iz rough
Ain't no one we can trust
Either roll with the rush or get rushed
'Cause all we got iz us

These evil streets iz rough
Ain't no one we can trust
Either roll with the rush or get rushed
'Cause all we got iz us
These evil streets

Seen the world through the eyes of a nigga on the brink
Drugs got my brain fried making it hard to think
I'm trapped in these evil streets
Drivin' some scuffed up ragged down beat up past times
Some kid pulls up with chrome dimple guided rims
Now I'm thinking it's 3 in the a.m., I'm walking and he in a BM
Drop top 3, he don't even see me
Would you believe, he saw my gun in 3D

10 blocks later trying to work the CD
Spotted 15 on the BQE
'Cause ain't no way them pigs is baggin' me
And up a Sonsee we official nasty

For niggas that force the issue, my man'll toss the pistol
And of course I hit you, let that loss be with you
The more L's the higher, streets are fire
Make ice hearts in men, for worldly desire
Its the black attack born on the corner
Nigga grew up fast to get that looter ready to shoot 'er
And he do anything to achieve it, better believe it
Grew up in a band of thieves who retrieves the goods, stacking stacks

And pushing niggas shit back like they should
While we was gone, some shit undeveloped
Now parlay, sit back and watch armys swell up
Yeah, punk niggaz

As we move through these evil streets
As we move through these evil streets
As we move through these evil streets
As we move through these evil streets

Only nigga that can kill me is the nigga in the mirror
But when I cup the mic and make my fighting words clearer
A nigga without a gun is like something is missing
That was my employer-when I ain't have a pot to piss in
So listen, keep a gun, even if it's not needed
Better that than to have none and to be in deep shit
We mold on niggaz like Bacteria grows
Fools they lucky if they walk away with a black eye and a broken nose

Nigga, we kill niggaz for Polo and Hilfigers
It's all for real ill niggaz and steel figures
Ain't nothin' over here, won't be soft
Shit be jumping off on the rag
Don't beat me in the head with that, go head with that
I think back me in my mans rover
Rip out somebody's grandmother
Pulled out, the bitch ran for cover

Keep niggaz guessin' with our face without expressions
For niggaz stressin', I leave a lifetime impression
It shines like aggression when the flame comes out
Saw the 'bout, what you got, when your gang runs out
Shit's hot, you could get burned with heat
We take turns to sleep, you better learn the street
Knowledge, damn, you could get shot for 5 dollars
It's live wires with no signs of survivors

These evil streets iz rough
Ain't no one we can trust
Either roll with the rush or get rushed
'Cause all we got iz us

These evil streets iz rough
Ain't no one we can trust
Either roll with the rush or get rushed
'Cause all we got iz us
These evil streets

I think I can say things are...

Hold your breath and reach for the blue
Just me and you

Like a cloud of blossoms falling
I thought I''d reached the end this morning
Like a cloud of blossoms falling
Falling for you!

And I sat by the side of you
Tracing a line from your lips to your shoulders
Seemed to me like you knew
When you smiled with that beautiful smile...

Ain''t it such a gorgeous morning?

Alles klar jetzt gibts Megastress 
Ihr wolltet gerade gehen ah ah vergessts 
Wir wollen doch mal sehen wer hier wen verl䳳t 

do sagst do liebst jetzt 'ne andere Band 
I'm sorry I don't understand 
Auch wenn die letzten Jahre schwierig waren 
Was haben die denn schon was wir nicht haben? 

Versteh' schon do hast dich halt allein gef?br>Und nach der langen Zeit ein leichtes Spiel 
Dich einfach mal wieder nur zu ber? 
Do lieߴ dich nur verf?um irgendwas zu sp?br> 
Aber nur wir wissen was do wirklich brauchst 
Gings dir beschissen fingen wir dich auf 
Und gings dir besser waren wir auch dabei 
Klar h䴴e das ausgereicht aber wir brauchten Zeit 

Wir mussten weiter noch ein Bisschen um die H䵳er ziehen 
Wussten beide 'ne Beziehung ist nicht nur 'ne Idee 
Waren wir zusammen nicht ein Spitzenteam? 
Das haben wir nicht verdient 
Wir haben die Hits geschrieben 

Ich beweis dir dass wir nichts davon von verloren haben 
Wir fangen nochmal ganz vorne an 
Und h? nicht auf was all die Leute reden 
Aber wir sind dir bis heute Troy geblieben 

do hattest gute Zeiten wir waren mit dabei 
Wir werden dich begleiten 
Wir bleiben Troy 
Do hattest schlechte Zeiten und wir waren auch dabei 
Wir werden dich begleiten 
Wir bleiben Troy 

Die Zeit war hart kein High nur Low 
Und immer wieder diese Popstar Show 
Bei keinem Anderen war es wieder so 
Wie bei der coolen Band mit Smu-D-O 

do hattest deinen Spaߠvon Date zu Date 
Doch irgendwie hat irgendwo immer irgendwas gefehlt 

Spielt keine Rolle wieviel Zeit vergeht 
F?re Liebe ist es nie zu sp䴍

do weiߴ do und ich das war schon was 
Wir rauchten Stacks und Weed und Gras en masse 
Ich habe dich vollgetextet do hast zugeh?
Wir hatten tollen Sex mit allem Zubeh?

Ich frage was ist alt und rostet eh' nicht? 
Was h䬴 jung und kostet wenig? 
Fan and Band? Girl and Boy? 
Siegfried and Roy? Troy!

Wir werden dich begleiten

Do hattest schlechte Zeiten und wir waren auch dabei 
Wir werden dich begleiten

Do hattest schlechte Zeiten und wir waren auch dabei 
Wir werden dich begleiten 
Wir bleiben Troy 
Und wir bleiben Troy 

Wir kennen uns 'ne halbe Ewigkeit 
Hatten zu jeder Zeit nur wenig Streit 
Nur ab und zu gabs mal ein Bisschen Knatsch 
Bei all dem Klatsch und Tratsch f?t do dich verarscht 

Aber, es war nicht schwer dich wieder rumzukriegen 
Diese vier Jungs sind zum Verlieben 
Scheint als w䲥n wir immer jung geblieben 
Waren nicht sehr verschwiegen aber schwer verschieden 

Mal brauchtest do jemand der 'ne Quittung belegte 
Dir die Welt erkl䲴 oder mit dir Rennen f䨲t 

Mal wolltest do 'nen Bisschen tiefer gehen 
Alternative Ideen zu unserem miesen System 

Oder dir war mal eher so nach Luxusyacht 
Und wir haben durchgemacht I'm coolsten Club der Stadt 

Doch immer trafen wir den richtigen Ton 
Machten dir nie was vor h䴴e sich nicht gelohnt 

Von der Band I'm Land die dir troyer war 
Von der die CD dir nie zu teuer war 

Musik ist Therapie wir sind versteuerbar 
Hey sag mir nochmal do hast 'nen neuen Star 
Pah 

Ist schon Ok, ich versteh dich ja 

Ich finde ja auch das der mir 䨮lich sah 

Es kommt nacher da war die Reise vorbei 
Wir sind wieder bei dir und wir bleiben Troy 

do hattest gute Zeiten wir waren mit dabei

My hindsight’s blurry it’s looking grey, with a fuzz
Trying to muster all the foresight I can use, for the road
Cause out here ain’t no streetlights I can view, where we go
This was supposed to be the desert I’m confused, cause it’s cold
Seeking what sunlight reflecting off the moon, could expose
Took two, for the road

Drank four, to the dome

And I’m scared for you cause you could die and never said goodbye
Why you trust me so? Why’d you let me lead

I stray in the quiet cold
And you gird me when I dare to listen

Elastic meadow, endless arms of sorrow
Lips try to form ""because""
Trying to adapt to the wilderness
Where even foes close their eyes and leave

We are inside the glade
Every now and then I wipe the dust aside
To remember

How I drape my face with my bare hands
The same that brought me here
But you were beyond all help

Shadows skulk at my coming
We survey the slopes
In search for the words to write the missing page

Crestfallen still.
Those eyes, empty like a barren well.
It was the only task I would undertake.
To reap the harvest that was mine.
The seed that had sprung into a florid meadow,
And left me helpless in your embrace.
The bond we never spoke of, once stark and enticing,
Now slowly smoldering to dust.
The celestial touch, from grey to black.
A fathomless void enclosing.
Unwritten secrets beneath the cobwebs.

Emptiness followed by her wake.
I could clasp her in undying love.
Within ghostlike rapture the final word was mine.
She faced me in awe. 'twas a token of ebony color.
Embodied in faint vapor.
Wandering through April's fire.
Compelled to grasp and to hold the one that was you.
I will endure, hide away.
I would outrun the scythe, glaring with failure.
It is a mere destiny I thought, a threshold I had crossed before.

And nighttime birds float as black faces.
It was the hand reaching out through the mirror.
Unknown and scarred by life...

The luring eyes, you had never seen.
You have nothing more to find.
You have nothing more to loose.
The cold season drifts over the land.

They huddle in the brown corners.
Some would settle for less.
The castles were all empty, asleep.
Long awaiting their king.

Draped within a fate I could not change,
And always welcoming Winter's EPILOGUE.",Karma

Long enough for our last breath of life.

At times resembling the Devil's concubine.
And me, I am the idol that would long
To caress our eyes until they would open no more.
I would comfort you if I only could,
But as we all know by now... I am just thin air.
Unaware as you are of my presence,
You are losing yourself.

So there I was
Within the sobriety of the immortals
A semblance of supernatural winds passing through

The gate was closed that day, but I was bound to carry on
She could not see me through the windows

In dismay, strangest twist upon her lips
Graven face, she said my name
Once inside I heard whispers in the parlour
The gilded faces grin, aware of my final demise
And I cried, I knew she had lied
Her obsession had died, it had died

When is death our lone beholder?
When do we walk the final steps?
When can we scream instead of whisper?

Bearing her pain in the wilderness

In that moment she knew",Godhead's Lament
Opeth,"Kept warm by the light of the lantern
Lost sight of everything tonight
My presence blackens their pattern
A pock in the healthy and calm 

Their scorn behind your back
My promise would put them down
No trace of reverence left
Immemorial fire in their eyes 

I would perish at the given signal
At the slightest touch from my soul
Tainted prophet in flesh
For all the plagued and lost 

Dripping sin
Decision in stalemate
Dare to feel death at hand
Surprised me with its voice
Through the forest came the morn 

Across the leafy pathway
Their deeds smeared in blood
For all to behold
The council of the cross
Must have sensed my coming
The pest through the air
With despise for squalor
Lashing out at the poor 

I turned away my eyes
In pallor escape from the end
Fading time to leave from here
And less to fulfill my task

Taken away from stifling grace
And saved from the past",Moonlapse Vertigo
Opeth,"The sigh of summer upon my return
Fifteen alike since I was here
Bathed in deep fog, blurring my trail
Snuffing the first morning rays 

Weary from what might have been ages
Still calm with my mind at peace
Would I prosper or fall, drain the past
The lapse of the moment took it's turn 

I was foul and tainted, devoid of faith
Wearing my death-mask at birth
The hands of God, decrepit and thin
Cold caress and then nothing
I was taken away from my plight
A treason bestowed to the crowd
Branded a jonah with fevered blood
Ungodly freak, defiler 

Pale touch, writhing in the embers
Damp mud burning in my eyes
All the faces turned away
And all would sneer at my demise 

Outcast with dogmas forged below
Seared and beaten, banished from where I was born
No mercy would help me on my way
In the pouring rain nothing is the same 

Vows in ashes
I pledge myself to no-one
Seethed and spiteful
All shudder at the call of my name
If you'll bear with me
You'll fear of me 

There is no forgiveness in these eyes
For any of you but one
Dispel the mist for now
Melinda is the reason why I've come 

She is water drops over the pyre
A thistle in my hands
Stained and torn, aged and brown
Virtuous shell with kindred innocence 

I awoke from the miasma
Passing swiftly through the moor
This is here, waters stir
And in the distance all that was lost
If youÂ´ll bear with me
YouÂ´ll fear of me
YouÂ´d never leave me to
A fate with you",The Moor

Voices fell like marble
No longer by my side
Gone all that would linger 

Ripped from my embrace
Melinda reflected in shafts
Red line round her neck
Met the earth in silence 

White faced, haggard grin
This serenity painted death
With a halo of bitter disease
Black paragon in lingering breath 

Saw here fading, blank stare into me
Clenched fist from the beautiful pain 

Darkness reared its head
Tearing within the reeling haze
Took control, claiming my flesh
Piercing rage, perfect tantrum

Each and every one would die at my hand
Choking in warm ponds of blood
At last, weak and torn, I went down
Drained from strength, flickering breath 

Came with the moon
The wayward in conscious state
Flanked and barred in destiny's end
Underneath with hope in laches

Swathed in filth, any would betoken

From the bowels of sin",Serenity Painted Death
Opeth,"Still it came passing by
The pieces weaved together rose the sun
And fooled me with another day
The knocking message called for my life 

Sealed the spell of my scrawny body
Soil to skin, my next of kin
Damp air grasped, stole the words
And greeted me with a hiss 

This is forgiveness, so I know
Once I repent I seal the lid
I slither for you and IÂ´m dying
I find trust in hate 

They wear white for me
Seemingly jaded and lost

Keeper of holy hoards
Keeper of holy whores

To see a beloved son
In despair of what's to come

If one cut the source of the flow
And everything would change
Would conviction fall
In the shadow of the righteous
The phantasm of your mind
Might be calling you to go
Defying the forgotten morals
Where the victim is the prey",Ghost of Perdition
Opeth,"Majesty
Faithful me
Pour yourself
Into me

To the ground

Slake my thirst
Eternal wealth
Heathen key
Round my neck

This poetry
Our blasphemy
Know the sounds
Of infamy

The eyes of the devil
Fixed on his sinners

The hands of Satan
Assembling his flock
Pale horse rider
Searching the earth

Whispered conjuration
A belief takes form
Choking hand tapping
The veins in your throat

His orders in your mouth
A decree for domination
Beneath the tides of wisdom
Spins the undertow of hate

Injected seeds of vengeance
Usurper's eyes of the powerless
Clean path to his kingdom
Beckoning in the mist

And the fever that's been haunting me
Has gone away

Looking through my window
I seem to recognize
All the people passing by
But I am alone
And far from home
And nobody knows me

Opeth,"There's a sense of longing in me
As I read Rosemary's letter
Her writing's honest
Can't forget the years she's lost

In isolation
She talks about her love
And as I read
""I'll die alone""
I know she was aching

There's a certain detail seen here
The pen must have slipped to the side
And left a stain
Next to his name
She knows he's gone 

And isolation
Is all that would remain

Opeth,"I have often told you stories about the way
I lived the life of a drifter waiting for the day
When I'd take your hand and sing you songs
And may be you would say
""Come lay with me and love me""
And I would surely stay

Now I feel I'm growing older
And all the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill going round
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune.

Many times I've been a traveller
I looked for something new
In days of old when nights were cold
I wandered without you
Those days I thought my eyes
Could see you standing near
Though blindness is confusing
It shows that you're not here.

Now I feel I'm growing older
And all the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill going round
I guess I'll always be

Cast from the throne of secrecy

Hear him spewing forth a meaning to miserables lies
See the twisted hand of doubt seal the affair
The insect trust, believer
Your body a vehicle to

Pearls before swine they are nothing but blind
Submit to nothing and swallow my spit of scorn
Invisible king, dying
Procession of woe, struck down by sorrow

A burden so great
Weighs heavy on old and withered beliefs
The swift solution crumbles
Beneath the mock notes of a masterpiece

Crops they were sown to die

This skin is a mirror
The eyes hover with ignorance
Hell throb from your lips
Sucked in and safe from the world of sleep

All years caring for a liar
The barren drift road is winding higher
You're a moth too close to the fire

You are stuck in a beautiful future
Changing and waiting and seeking the truth of it all

Fleeting in sorrow
Pushing your spirit away
Seeking the weakness of dislike

I stray in the quiet cold
And you gird me when I dare to listen

Elastic meadow, endless arms of sorrow
Lips try to form ""because""
Trying to adapt to the wilderness
Where even foes close their eyes and leave

We are inside the glade
Every now and then I wipe the dust aside
To remember
How I drape my face with my bare hands

The same that brought me here
But you were beyond all help
The folded message that wept my name
Shadows skulk at my coming

We survey the slopes
In search for the words to write the missing page

As the piper plays his time
We are almost there
You are beyond all help
Dancing into the void

Stained by soil, symbols of death.

All of which are stared upon, with porcelain eyes it seems.
Some spoke, and it was my turn to go.

Gazing unto the stars
Please, take me there

Slave to a sorrow that is whispering within
I'm always waiting for you before I sleep
There is no comfort in the distance that we keep

In a river of grief I am drowning

Balancing on the edge of failure
And relieved, should I fall

Voices of despair is a familiar friendship
A society in your head holds the code to destruction

Fire on the other side

There comes a time when the river runs dry
Winter comes and we sacrifice
Our lives",River
Opeth,"The mist is sleeping on the water
And winter is hiding in my heart
Thorns in my eyes are slowing me down
I can't pass through to the other side
She knows I'm the one who sought her
But when we fall, we'll fall so hard
She holds a secret and won't show me how
How to break the riddle in her eyes

This is treason of the mind and soul
Death is no reason why you would go

Inside the ghost of love is laughing
It mocks the footsteps where I go
It tells me nothing has been lost
It whispers: ""you've seen darkness before""
In time the hurting will subside
And longing is overthrown
What's left is a void that grows inside
And the echo of a failure

This is treason of the mind and soul
Death is no reason why you would go

Have you ever had the feeling of a sorrow inside?
Have you ever been the reason why a hope subsides?
Have you ever seen the aftermath of giving up?

Have we given up?
Is it over?
Have you given up?
Is winter hiding in your heart?",Voice of Treason
Opeth,"A beloved name inside my heart
A fleeting glance became the start
A missing word I am still awaiting
A wretched deception, I am creating",Persephone
Opeth,"And on the furthest day when you lay down
Discard your disarray and your rusted crown
And face the wretched image of you and I
No trust in what you say, you are a dead poison seed
Stronger when you are away, you have nothing that I need
The rhyme has settled in the ghost of a sigh
Nothing now remains, now you will leave me be

Sunrise into the moonlight
A broken body lies in wait
Your prize won you the stark night
And you made peace with your fate
Blind eyes sensitive only to white light
Reacting just a bit too late
Preying on insecurity, a design of your schemes
A true believer of purity must tend to what it means
Or allow its gospel to turn into a lie
You forsake everything you feel in favor of despair
Immune and blind to everything that is real in your secret lair
And cast away the captive heart that was thine

And you will go and leave me be

Winter in your soul, building a wasteland
And you tread a thin ice 'neath your feet
Sneering, and everyone you would shun
Collecting flowers to your wreath
Lifeline, a river cuts deep in your cold hand
It is changing when you try to breathe

Leave it all behind you, there is comfort in giving up
A seed in a barren soil might curl up into a coil
Flourish into something new
Give back what you thought was ""you""
And give way to all that is new

Leave it all behind you",Chrysalis
Opeth,"There's a sign in the rain
Every now and again
It is a symbol of hope
In the midst of a catastrophic episode

In the hour of death
There's a spiritual wealth
When we dance through the rain
And form the signs once again
If even for a second

I hear a voice on the air
It has a warning to share
""Don't believe what you see""
""You can't perceive what you feel""

But if I do what I'm told
And shun the spirit I hold
I'm no longer a human
And I will not shift with the sands

The end of an era
One starts anew
You know the devil
He lives in you

There are moments of doubt when I don't know what to do
And giving in is the only way out
When there's too much shouting about how I should choose

Incapacitated, I'm left behind
In a sea of hatred I go blind
A storm is coming, I hide away
In the years of need reason leads astray

The end of an era
One starts anew
You know the devil
He lives in you

Opeth,"Up until recently I have been alone
Leading a tranquil life but never at home
Something had changed and I turned to the wind
That blew through me and told me, ""how long? How long?""

Silenced the voice of my heart now for years
I was perplexed by a fleeting blank stare
Biding my time until courage had build up inside me
Then came clean, ""or am I wrong""
I spend all my days contemplating my will
For the weak shall inherit the earth when it's still
A government bid for my life
I was sold as a cog in a machine, ""i walk the line""

A fleeting glance again tells me everything
Took a chance in vain, drown to a futile idea
A pursuit of happiness as the storm rolls in
An idol of helplessness, paved the way and then gave in

I met with my mother and I asked her why
For ten years so more she would never reply
Suddenly she said we are all born to die
Gave me purpose, freed me, ""how simple it can be""

But it's fading away from my mind
There's another ""me"" waiting behind

But it's fading away from my mind
There's another ""me"" waiting behind",A Fleeting Glance

Opeth,"An afternoon walk through the park
I keep to the shadows until it's dark

I am not educated nor free of sin
I carry thoughts of giving in
There is a void surrounding me
No sound, and in the black I can not see
There is a chasm between you and me
You have no face, no body, no words to speak

There is a wickedness in me
I can't seem to make it go away
I am a spiritual leper but I can see
A flock of believers gone astray

There's eternal night in my gaze
I'm cast out and I am not like you
Find my way on through the haze
I'm liquefied in a strange brew

An early morn walk through the park
I look to the sun when it is cold and stark

I blend with the crows of robot minds
Never a leader, I am always behind

A voice through the rain tells me I'm here
A glance from a veil brings me to tears

Failure underground
Heart is sick and fever is high

I watch them from afar
Feeding, breeding, scheming
Tell me I am wrong

Hiding from discovery
Staring down into the ground
Had they seen the posion in me
A tide of spite wound be found

Moving faster lingering gaze
Feasting on my sanity
A grain of sand against endless waves
A wish for the slaughter of conformity

Searing skin on a funeral pyre
Blinding light as the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre

Inside me sleeps a violence waiting to be freed

When the words you have written down reads ""everything is gone""

You took the best part of me

I knew a love that was the way it should be 
If only I could pull us both together again
I could make you so happy

Swimming in the sea I'm drowning in and 
The waves calling out my pain

How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

I'm waitin on better days 

Money talks and everybody listens
Nobody stops on the point that they're missin in the system
Whatever price could be right
Even if the price is the loss of another life
We used to be stick up
Kids regret the things that we did
Tryin to live positive
When friends were doin this

Murderous attackers
Battlin fashions
Benjamins and Jacksons at the heart of the actions

Think you would be missed if you didn't exist
So stay the the hell off my muthafucking shit list !

Money money make the world go round...",Better Daze
OPM,"Sometimes 
I forget that you're not here 
Can't believe it's been a year 
Since you flew away 
And I never got to say goodbye 
Good times
Hangin' out til the break of dawn
Listening to Bob
And singin along
Every little thing it's gonna be
It's gonna be all right...

I know that you're gonna fly
Somewhere brighter on the other side
And one day I'm gonna be there too
Where the sun is shining and the water's blue
I know that you're gonna fly
Somewhere brighter on the other side
I know you're somewhere where you're finally free
You'll always be a part of me
Like the moon is to the sea 

They say you don't know
A good thing till it's gone
But I got to say they're wrong
I knew you were a good friend 
A good friend all along
I wish the world wouldn't be so cold
As to take such a beautiful soul 
But despite it all I know we gotta carry on

I know that you're gonna fly
Somewhere brighter on the other side 
And one day I'm gonna be there too
Where the sun is shinin and the water's blue

I know that you're gonna fly
Somewhere brighter on the other side 
I know you're somewhere where you're finally free
And you'll always be a part of me
Like the moon is to the sea 

I know that you're gonna fly
Somewhere brighter on the other side.. 
Always be a part of me... 

If I could rewind time
Then I'd like to let you know
Just one thing before your time go 
That every moment you were living was a blessing to me 
And I saw inside of you things that others couldn't see
Now people put you down for the way that you lived 
But those people never knew you the way that I did
Don't be ashamed of who you were of how you died
I know you just wanted to find the brighter side...

I know that you're gonna fly
Somewhere brighter on the other side 
And one day I'm gonna be there too
Where the sun is shining and the water's blue
I know that you're gonna fly
Somewhere brighter on the other side
I know you're somewhere where you're finally free
And you'll always be a part of me

But you don't know why your going,
Everyday it's just the same, it's stupid and boring and it feels like you're going insane.

Slow down there's no reason to panic because one day your still gonna make it,

You wake up one day look around and realize your losing time
The tide has got you and you watch as your life starts to divide
Thought you'd go with the flow and the next thing you know feels like your drowning
Take a step back, check yourself, make sure you don't fuck it up, and then you do it again

That I'd find, inspiration
Or something that would touch me
Grounded so deep my feet can't even move me.
Time runnin' in the rat race all day
I'm thinking whose life is it anyway
Feelin' worthless can't find the surface
Swimmin' in my mind just to find the purpose
And the tides all low and I'm all exposed
Eyes froze makes me wonder bout this path I chose
Nobody told you when to run, Bang Bang
You missed the starting gun

With brothas smokin' on there 
Damn we rollin 
Hadnin' the mic 
Till we decide about the safe life 

California where I raised till this very day 
Hell to pay for the ways of the blaze 
Everyday a hundred miles an hour 

Cause my soul's been devoured 
Never looked up above 
And push came to shove 
As it usually does 
Keepin' with these thugs 

Doin' all of these drugs with no means of direction 
Infection 
But here's my objection 
Rejection 
By your whole congregation 
With no empathy for my situation 
No place in society that's my reality 
Angry don't know who's the enemy 
I'm in deep 
Underneath the streets 
It's hard to creep from city to city 
With all these hitters and the heat 
Killin' me stealin from me 
Makes no sense to me 
So I keep it tight with the homies in the family

Born and raised in the golden state 

Servin' up some dinner

Risin from the

Lined up against the walls

Disguised as paradise

I come form the West Coast small town south side
Born in OC grew up in 805
Flew the nest and ended up in LA
Still a villain' still chillin' still smokin' on the challis
They're like dogs in this place
Other people pissin' on other people's real estate
It's hard to live here
People are aggressive so people live in fear
With a lock you protect your block pop, pop goes the gloc
Cause everybody else always wants what you got
So stay on top of your game and try to retain
Your own domain
It ain't easy holdin' down the throne
But California is where we call home
Hell yeah we live like kings fuck bling bling
Take a look at all these beautiful things
Every single day the sunshine state
Every single meal avocado on my plate
Every single girl got a beautiful face
Hell yeah I love this place
Kali kings on the beach we sing
Ain't really trippin' on a thing
Can't really be worried
About what tomorrow brings
Kali kings on the beach we sing
Ain't really trippin' on a thing
Can't really be worried
About what tomorrow brings
I come from the coast with the most
A host for parasites up close in tight long summer nights
I ain't talkin' shit I ain't braggin'
My pants are still saggin' and I'm still taggin'
Grew up on the beach so that's where I got slurs in my speech
I got stitches from skatin' ditches
We call 'em hynas not bitches
I'm devout to chillin' out
This lifestyle here is what I'm all about
No matter how we figure it out
Just keepin' real y'all no doubt
Life style so simplistic all y'all must of missed it
Don't understand how we get on the pimp shit
Live it every single day
It's just another sunny day in LA
Come on Cali
Every single day the sunshine state
Every single meal avocado on my plate
Every single girl got a beautiful face
Hell yeah I love this place
Kali kings on the beach we sing
Ain't really trippin' on a thing
Can't really be worried
About what tomorrow brings
Kali kings on the beach we sing
Ain't really trippin' on a thing
Can't really be worried
About what tomorrow brings
Cali love is what I go t
Whether I'm here or whether I'm not
It's the good times sunshine on my mind al the time
Friends like these are hard to find
We're just some cats with some tats
Still misunderstood
Still hangin' out in the neighborhood
It's all good we're just doin' our thing
Kickin' back with Johnny Richter and the Kottonmouth Kings
Now there's a new face gracin' this fat ass track
Swingin' harder than a motherfuckin' baseball bat
I'm comin' strong repin' Cali all day long
See we the kings of California home to bongs and thongs
Now from the 310 to the 714
So many people down to clown when it's time to get raw
Don't try to test the waters we like hungry piranhas
We'll leave you in a state of trauma
Cryin' screamin' for your momma
It's time to stand tall and take a look all around
Remember where you're from I'm from P town
Time to go and chase your childhood dreams
Time to learn to fly so go and spread your wings
Open up your eyes take off your shades and see
You got to aim high you gotta believe
Do what you want be what you want to be
Dreams do come true just take a look at me and see
Kali kings on the beach we sing
Ain't really trippin' on a thing
Can't really be worried
About what tomorrow brings
Kali kings on the beach we sing
Ain't really trippin' on a thing
Can't really be worried
About what tomorrow brings

OPM,"I got drunk last night left my skateboard in the front yard
Looked out the window it ain't there no more
My car's been broke down for three months
I can't even go to the store to buy some blunts
If my dog could talk he'd ask me why I don't feed him
Go to the other dogs say I don't need him
He's OK but some how I gotta beat him

My girl left me for another girl kinda crazy
I guess it's 'cause I'm fat and sometimes lazy
If I don't go to work I guess there not gonna pay me
Somehow someway I know I'm gonna make it

I'm not bling blingin' but at least I didn't fake it
Seems like nothing's changing but the weather
Shit can't get any worse now so
When's it gonna get better

But any way's that's just how I feel today
Here's an example what it's like to be me
Living like this you know it ain't that easy
I found my remote but know I can't find my TV
I'm sitting on my couch watchin' time pass
If you call low class you can kiss my ass

The problems I got you must not got them
Well there's nowhere to fall when you're sitting on the bottom
Just sipping on this bottle tryin' to solve them
I'm out here desperate as all hell

Tryin' to make a living stealin' penny's from the wishing well
Somehow someway I know I'm gonna make it
What ever y'all dish you know I'm gonna take it
Seems like nothing's changing but the weather
Shit can't get any worse now so
When's it gonna get better

But any way's that's just how I feel today
Seems like nothing's changing but the weather
Shit can't get any worse now so
When's it gonna get better

But any way's that's just how I feel today
And tomorrow I probably feel a different way
And that's OK

Tell me who be the biggest of them all
Well ill be you and you be the BM
Let the fools make their decisions
No they take it with me

Give me a five iron and I'm gonna switch baby laid out

Yo the front to back
Fifteen's in the trunk to let em know where I'm at

Spinnin' only true spokes about to play a big game

Oppenheimer,"Summers in your heart but I know that you're staying
Taking a ride but it feels like we're paying
For the madness that occurred with a ticket to good times
Hunter promised this but he wasn't ready

For the first time, standing with my friends singing bright light
Saw you going crazy on the dance floor
I've taken one already but I want more
This time I wanna feel it

Breakfast in New York and I know that we're dreaming
Drunken conversations and the things we were scheming
To get out of this town and take a trip underground
How Paitment [unverified] promised this but he wasn't ready

For the first time, standing with my friends in the bright light
Saw you going crazy on the dance floor
I've taken one already but I want more
This time I'm going to feel it

To stop my heart from breakin' every day

Heal my agony, memories every day
Tried every way make you go away

Starin' at my ceiling every night
Waitin' for some guiding light
Why have all your pictures closed their eyes
I know you're out there someone give me a sign

So I want you to release me, I'll do anything

Heal my agony, memories every day
Tried every way make you go away

Contemplated bullet in the brain
Silent voices relieve the pain
Echoed whispers all that remains
Why'd you tell me? No one's to blame
Still cryin' in my shame

Fleeting moments in my dreams
Callin' out my name so it seems

So I want you to release me, I'll do anything
To be set free, someone help me heal this agony

So I want you to release me, I'll do anything
To be set free if you're out there and can hear me

Oh God, can't you see? You're my reality

Oppressor,"Raped of virtue, led to betrayal
Darkness summoned, vows to renew

Age of blackened hearts
When darkness once resigned
Memories of dreams past
Torn by the nether world
Tears drowning your face
As the saviour comes
And the angels fell to the suffering

Led by the lies of disharmony
Starving the soul with life's agony
Demons have risen to summon the dead
Riding the world of humanity
Taking the dreams of life swept away
Memories once known are lost in dismay
A hybrid of sorrow,pain and despair
Lost of a hope that is too late to save

Ora,"There's a mountain
Which I wanted to climb
With tears on my mind
And there's a love song
That I needed to write
For someone so right
And I have seen a million fading stars
They were shining so bright
Through a steamy night
There's more that could be put in words
Somethings that's true
And that's what I got from you

You are the one
Who's taking me there
You are the one
Breathing despair
You are the one
Who's shining on me
You are the one
Savin' my life
You light up my mind

And love was a good thing
When I needed to feel
That I always believed
Now I'll be holding on

You bared your sould I waltzed right in
You gave me everything

You spilled your guts on my best shoes

It's only love that makes you feel like I'm getting
So completely
Naked and you don't remember
How you let yourself become so unraveled
Your naked pretty as a heartache
Waiting for your second skin to settle in

My hardened heart can't hide me now
It loves as much as I allow
And in the end the eyeball army will just drag me down
And I'll be

And I know there's nothing that can hide me now

You'll get a grand piece of my heart
And I feel
That this is just the part of the start

And it'll all flame out
The blaze hides a burning flame
It'll all burn on
As time goes by
I'm gona love you more and more
I'm never ever giving' up on love

But I'm sometimes needin' more
And one day I know
We'll sit in front of a window
No heart bleeds and we watch the snow covering the streets
But for now it's true that sometimes when I think of you
I'm feelin blue",Sometimes
Orange Blue,"There's a mountain
Which I wanted to climb
With tears on my mind
And there's a love song
That I needed to write
For someone so right
And I have seen a million fading stars
They were shining so bright
Through a steamy night
There's more that could be put in words
Somethings that's true
And that's what I got from you

You are the one
Who's taking me there
You are the one
Breathing despair
You are the one
Who's shining on me
You are the one
Savin' my life
You light up my mind

And love was a good thing
When I needed to feel
That I always believed
Now I'll be holding on
To all the things that we have got
And get sadness for free
And there were stars that lead me far away
Now once I've turned the page
And now I keep holding on

You are the one...

Will you still believe
When I run out of rhyme
A streets of reason
I just can't deny
I'm still believing
In the truth of our rain
'Cause in the corner of my history
I'm hiding my pain

You are the one
Who's raising my care
You are the one
Breathing despair
You are the one
Who's taking me there
You are the one
Breathing despair

You are the one

Orange Blue,"I switch off that light
To make room for another truth
Gotta get to the bottom of my grief
Encased by memories
And charged by history
Tryin' to release this gift of love
Than everytime I lift my head
I fall down again

Lena show me how to get along
You're appearing in my dreams
Lena knows what I've been looking for
And I'll be fine, I'll be carefree
And you could sing for me

with a toumor in my mind
I loved and left behind
And I cried as I tried to win that fight
Infinite reality, mysterious sceneries -
It seems nothing but a dream can get me out
Everytime I lift my head up high
I miss that sky

Lena show me how when Lena sings for me

I gurgle with some youth again
And tell the moon about the man
Though it knows about the spirit of my mind
So I raise my head again
And bend my knees to fall again
And I can take the pain as long as I believe

that Lena sings for me
Lena sings for me…

To devert from the night",Lena
Orange Blue,"Sometimes when she looks up 
It seems as if sheÂ´s by herself
Devil whispers in my ear, 
I tried in vain to reach her world

There are many silent words, 
Raising heads while the tide still sounds 
And there are many weeping eyes 
Hand in hand while the wind still pounds

But the cycle never ends, 
The curtain falls burying my tears
Though the carpet of gold 
Seemed to be quite near

SheÂ´s got that light around her eyes 
A gleaming star surrounds her mind
SheÂ´s got that smile imbued with soul
I need her hand, Â´cause sheÂ´s my home 

SheÂ´s got that light around her eyes 
A gleaming star surrounds her mind 
SheÂ´s got that smile imbued with soul 
I need your hand, Â´cause you're my home 

Wish you could hear the sound 
Of my trembling faceless thoughts
Wish I could stop the fading of my dream 
With honest words 

And the youth of your voice 
Feels like the touch of fallin' snow
Sitting in the dark, 
Hoping that future will grow 

SheÂ´s got that light around her eyes 
A gleaming star surrounds her mind
SheÂ´s got that smile imbued with soul
I need her hand, Â´cause sheÂ´s my home 

SheÂ´s got that light around her eyes 
A gleaming star surrounds her mind 
SheÂ´s got that smile imbued with soul 
I need your hand

I know for sure IÂ´ll listen to your song 
I wouldnÂ´t leave you in times of glacial storm
Tell me where are you coming from ? 
YouÂ´re my own true love in a foreign home

Orange Blue,"Never suffered love so easily
It's like a dream being raised from its sleep.
You showed me the face of northern lights
Breath of words I inhale every night
And I must have done a thousand rhymes
But I wonder where you sleep at night

You fill my dreams and share them with me
You are the seeds of what will come
And I'll be in love with you forever.
I would never use a word like this…
Carelessly

I don't care about a thing they say
There were times when I thought that I should
Cause they don't know about my inner face,
No one has come as close as you do.
My affection scares myself sometimes
I intend to love you till I die

You fill my dreams and share them with me
You are the seeds of what will come
And I'll be in love with you forever.
I would never use a word like this…

You brought light when there was haze.

On the future of today
So why not live right now and face it?
Then your day will never fade away

We've got eyes but we don't see
We've got ears that don't hear
Is there anybody with me?
Is there anybody with me yea?
We've got hands that long to reach for
We've got lips that long to kiss
We're heading for tomorrow
But life is here and now

I embrace your truthful picture
Feel you close here by my side
But if you ever should go someplace else
I'll be with you through the faces of time

When dreams become true
And what if we have to deal
With what is real
So lend me your time
Yet I'm going to give it back to you

Orange Juice,"I looked deep within my pocket
For the note you sent to me
To put it in a nutshell
You're a heartless mercenary

Shoo-shoo-shoo-shoodoo, goodness gracious
Shoo-shoo-shoo-shoodoo, you're so audacious
Shoo-shoo-shoo-shoodoo

I looked behind the iron curtain
For a greater dignity
And now I'm more than certain
You're a heartless mercenary

Shoo-shoo-shoo-shoodoo, goodness gracious
Shoo-shoo-shoo-shoodoo, you're so audacious
Push me and pull me
The blind lead the blind
I don't have no money
Can I pay you in kind?

Orange Juice,"I started to write this song about you
Then I decided that I would write it all about love
It then occurred to me
That you weren't happy
That's for sure, positively
That's what the world is made for
So give me more...

L.O.V.E.
Love is a walk down Main street
Love is an apple that's so sweet
Love is something that can't be beat
L.O.V.E.
It's strange to me

I can't explain this feeling
Can't you see that salvation is freeing
It's all in the heavens
Can't you see
You can always depend on me
To give you love

Love is a fire within my soul
Love is a story that can't be told
Can't you feel it burning more and more
Stop and look at the big wheel roll

I can't explain this feeling
Can't you see that salvation is freeing
I would give my life for the glory
Just to be able to tell the story
'Bout...

I didn't mean to make you mad
A sweet story, I thought I had
But maybe time will bring us together
And I will be such a happy fella
'Bout...

Love is something that is so divine
Love is a feeling (that)'s a friend of mine
It can't be measured by no time
In your heart or even in your mind
Love is a fire within my soul
Love is a story that can't be told
Can't you feel it burning more and more
Stop and look at the big wheel roll",L.O.V.E. Love
Orange Juice,"Can you hear me calling from afar
As you drove uptown in his Daddy's car
Gonna write you a letter in a hesitant hand
Conveying that I feel I understand
Just why you called me an obsessive
More than just a might possessive

There'll always be a place in my heart for you
There'll always be a place in my heart

If I may be so bold as to make the assertion
That your only lover is just an aversion
Maybe in time when the time is right
Together we'll scale those dizzy heights
Although you called me an obsessive and
More than just a might possessive

There'll always be a place in my heart for you
There'll always be a place in my heart

There'll always be a place in my heart for you
There'll always be a place in my heart

There'll always be a place in my heart for you
There'll always be a place in my heart

There'll always be a place in my heart for you
There'll always be a place in my heart

There'll always be a place in my heart for you
There'll always be a place in my heart

There'll always be a place in my heart for you
There'll always be a place in my heart

I'm gonna sock it to you
Oh hallelujah

There'll always be a place in my heart for you
There'll always be a place in my heart",A Place in My Heart
Orange Juice,"When I first saw you
Something stirred within me
You were standing sultry in the rain
If I could've held you
I would've held you
Rip it up and start again

Rip it up and start again
Rip it up and start again
I hope to God you're not as dumb as you make out
I hope to God
I hope to God
And I hope to God I'm not as numb as you make out
I hope to God
I hope to God

And when I next saw you
My heart reached out for you
But my arms stuck like glue to my sides
If I could've held you
I would've held you
But I'd choke rather than swallow my pride
Rip it up and start again

Rip it up and start again
Rip it up and start again
I hope to God you're not as dumb as you make out
I hope to God
I hope to God
And I hope to God I'm not as numb as you make out
I hope to God
I hope to God

And there was times I'd take my pen
And feel obliged to start again
I do profess
That there are things in life
That one can't quite express
You know me I'm acting dumb-dumb
You know this scene is very humdrum
And my favourite song's entitled 'boredom'

Rip it up and start again
I said rip it up and start again
I said rip it up and rip it up and rip it up and rip it up and rip it up and start again",Rip It Up
Orange Juice,"It may be my imagination
And of course I'm prone to exaggeration
But in the moth eaten gloom of my shabby room I saw the strangest manifestation
One possible explanation is that it was merely a trick of the light
But that's little consolation
'Cause it's gotten so that I can't sleep at night!!

What Presence?!

Steppin' out 'neath a harvest moon, steppin' out to the strains of this self-same tune and it's screaming in my ears",What Presence?!
Orange Juice,"You came exactly on the hour
You know such precision worries me
I like it but in her mower [unknown]
As you watch me from the balcony

Take the stage and take the plunge
Break a leg or a bust a lung
I'll disarm those who carry guns
And neutralize their caustic tongues

The shattered fragments of a star
Shining with a cruel content
We'll make our way to Tommy's Bar
While whistling a sad lament

That's what you are
That's what you are
That's what you are
That's what you are
What you are",A Sad Lament
Orange Juice,"When he spoke she smiled in all the right places
In her smile he saw the poison she tasted
She wasn't listening to the sweet words
He wasn't listening to her lying tongue
He was listening to the words being sung
By the blue boy

Friends told him of her young heart's passion
Down by the sea where the blue waves crashing
She wasn't listening to the sweet words
He wasn't listening to her lying tongue
He was listening to the words being sung
By the blue boy

Oh curse and bless him with the gabardine which surrounds him
See him writhe at the sight of your eyes which repel him
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
He won't be listening to your sweet words
He won't be listening to your lying tongue
He'll be listening to the words being sung
By the blue boy

Whoa whoa blue boy
Whoa whoa blue boy
Whoa whoa blue boy
Cheerio, blue boy",Blue Boy

Orange Juice,"I used to spend each afternoon
Just locked in the confines of my room
'Cause my mother told me that I never should
Play with the gypsies down in the wood
Then I fell in with a bunch of hoods
Who go by the name of the 'Artisans'

Gonna trade in my snakeskin boots
Gonna trade in my rhinestone suit
'Cause I'm in cahoots with the 'Artisans'
Who just happen to be my favourite band
At the best all the rest are just 'also rans'
When compared to the fabulous 'Artisans'",The Artisans
Orange Juice,"I used to do my utmost to suspend belief
Until the day it hit me like a kick in the teeth
In the sensitivity stakes you're less than a non-starter
You don't need a lover you need a sparring partner

I guess I'm just a little too sensitive
I guess I'm just a little too sensitive
I guess I'm just a little too sensitive
For you

When you say your love is as bold as a flag
I say all I've got to show's a tattered rag
I guess I'll never learn to take the rough with the smooth
I'll never learn to live with that much abuse

I guess I'm just a little too sensitive
I guess I'm just a little too sensitive
I guess I'm just a little too sensitive

To collapse in a heap at your knees

They took the floor

Orange Juice,"If you listen, to the night
You can hear the darkness call
I can barely stand to wait
I can barely stand at all
C'mon closer to me now
It's like we're sharing the same skin
We gotta get out of this jail
We gotta let the future in
So many things in your life
That your bound to regret
Why didn't I do that?
Why didn't I do this?
So many chances you lost
That you'll never forget
Why didn't I make it?
Why didn't I take it right there?

A kiss is a terrible thing to waste
It's something that's always been so
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste

And one of these nights
You're gonna show me that you already know
There's a feast waiting for you
And you've never even gotten a taste
It's later than you think and
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste!
You shouldn't tremble when we touch
There's no reason for these fears
It's a promise that was made
We've been promised this for years
I wanna show you it all
What to do and where and how!
Cause we'll never be as young as we are right now
We'll never be as young as we are right now!

So many cries in the night
That you try to ignore
Why didn't I do this?
Why didn't I do that?
So many unanswered prayers
So many unopened doors
Why didn't I take it?
Why didn't I make it come true?
The loneliest words you'll ever know:
If only - if only it was so
The emptiest words that there'll ever be:
It could have been me
It could have been me
The loneliest words you'll ever- know:
If only - if only it was so
The emptiest words that there'll ever be:
It could have been me

I know you wouldn't like it if I told you how I feel
I just want to say that it's only common sense
but the words always fail me at my own expense
I'm staring out the window
wonder where you are
moving through the landscape at a million miles an hour

Across every ocean
for the sake of locomotion
but I wouldn't have a notion
how to save my soul
I walk down the sidewalk
run down the boardwalk
stop and make small talk
but I can't say no to you

REPEAT CHORUS

We've got telegraph, right across this land.
It doesn't mean a damn thing.
We don't understand, we never understand!

We'll never learn to guide our heart, we'll never find what we deserve
She's leaving, she waited for so long
She pretends that he cares, invents some tale just to get his heart
With no more dreams she didn't have
She washed her hands of this whole affair
She's leaving, she waited for so long
She's leaving, she waited for so long
But as she left, she gave her all, abandoned hope, she took for home
I thought I had all the dedicate, the more we learn, the less we know

To be that way 
She shouldn't have to go there

Now listen to us good
And listen well 
Listen to us all 
And everything we tell 

We should have known better 
Than to giver her away

To this very day 

Without me 
Without me 

Now listen Joan of Arc
All you gotta do
Is say the right words
And I'll be coming through
Hold you in my arms
And take you
Right away

Now she's on her way
To another land
We never understood
Why she gave her hand

She shouldn't oughta promise
Because it's just pretend
I know she doesn't mean it
And she'll leave again

Don't look at me, don't smile at me
Just close your eyes

I was so impressed by you
I was running blind
I would fall for every trick
Every twist of mind

Heaven is cold
Without any soul
It's hard to believe
I was so in love with you

Don't say your prayers, don't build your hopes
Just walk away
Don't phone me up, don't call around
Don't waste your time

You were so in awe of me
You were so divine
You would do just anything
To still be mine

Heaven is cold
Without any soul
It's hard to believe
I was so in love with you

All the things you said to me
I was so obsessed
You were always talking talking

Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark,"It took a lot of reasoning
Before she got to pleasing him
She made a combination
Of despair and inspiration
A mother and mistress
A sister to her sisters
A child who hoped her dreams come true
But now she's only stuck with you
At least she has a home to share
A man who comes to do her hair
A garden with a patio
A place to have a barbecue
The envy of her neighbors
Who smile and wave and ask her
If they could live for just a day
In luxury and ecstasy
But it's a long way home
From where she's come
It's a long way back
Too much to ask
The trash is in the garbage can
The mystery of Wonderland
One day she thinks of leaving him
The next she treats him like a king
She hears it on the radio
She sees it on the video
She waits until the kids have grown
And then she thinks she'll start again
But it's a long way home
From where she's come
It's a long way back
Too much to ask
Before she gave her friends a ring
She promised almost everything
They ran away to paradise
But everything will have its price
From woman number one
To woman number two
Now she's woman number three
And she thinks that she is lucky
But it's a long way home
From where she's come
It's a long way back
Too much to ask
From X why Z

Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark,"I discovered a big town
On the crest of a wave
Throwing money at strangers
Taking candy from babes
Shaking hands with the big top (?)
As the rain came down
I thought it would not stop
Sending letters to Paris
From the Empire State
Taking pictures from the top.
There's a lot of things
For you to do...
There's a lot of dreams
That won't come true.
I grew up in a big town
The lessons were not hard to learn.
If you want them to love you,
Then you must not love them, in return.

Where I drank so much
I fell under your spell...

Look and feel like hell.

There's no escape for you.
You say they've gone too far,

So it always ends the same,
And there's no one else to blame...
But I'd die

Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark,"Born in Kansas
On an ordinary plain
Ran to New York
But ran away from fame
Only seventeen
When all your dreams came true
But all you wanted was someone to undress you

But all the stars you kissed
Could never ease the pain.
Still the grace remains...
The face is changed
But it's still the same.

And it's a long, long way (long way)
From where you want to be
And it's a long, long road (too long)
But you're too blind to see

Afraid of silence
Of an innocence divine.
There's a dangerous creation
When you fail the test of time.
And all the photographs of ghosts along the road...
Still they hurt you so,
Won't let you go,
And you still don't know...

And when you look around, there's something else
Do you recognize them?
Wondered what it felt like?
Terrified by what's unseen?

But all the stars you kissed
Could never ease the pain...
(And) if the face is changed,
The grace remains...
But it's still the same.","Pandora's Box (It's a Long, Long Way)"

Behind the distant city
She will ride under the water
She will leave her son and daughter
Reduced to lying naked
To feed those she holds sacred
She is bare of clothes and beauty
On disply in her nudity
If someone calls her name out
All she ever hears are cars
Through the window in the bathroom
Through the broken glass and bars
Seeking comfort in the wallet
Where she placed eighty dollars
When the last one has departed
She can slide into the darkness
And slowly down the river
The current pulls her under
And it bathes her in its splendor
Is unmoved by her surrender
And faint through the water
The lights like brittle stars
Someone called her name out
She no longer hears the cars

Was someone to undress you
And all the stars you kissed
Could never ease the pain
Still the grace remains
And though the face has changed
You're still the same
And it's a long long way
From where you want to be
And it's a long long road
But you're too blind to see
Frame of silence
Of an innocence divine
Is a dangerous creation
When you fail the test of time
And all the photographs
Of ghosts of long ago
Still they hurt you so
Won't let you go
And you still don't know
And it's a long long way
From where you want to be
And it's a long long road
But you're too blind to see
When you look around yourself now
Do you recognize the girl?
The one who broke a thousand hearts
Terrified the world
And all the stars you kissed
Could never ease the pain
And if the face has changed
The grace remains
And you're still the same
And it's a long long way
From where you want to be
And it's a long long road
But you're too blind to see
And it's a long long way
From where you want to be
And it's a long long road
But you're too blind to see",Pandora's Box

Talk of days for which they sit and wait 
All will be revealed

Orchestre National de Jazz,"There's a lady who's sure 
All that glitters is gold 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
When she gets there she knows 
If the stores are all closed 
With a word she can get what she came for. 
Ooh  ooh  and she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
There's a sign on the wall 
But she wants to be sure 
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. 
In a tree by the brook 
There's a songbird who sings, 
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it makes me wonder. 
There's a feeling I get 
When I look to the west, 
And my spirit is crying for leaving. 
In my thoughts I have seen 
Rings of smoke through the trees, 
And the voices of those who standing looking. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it really makes me wonder. 
And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
And a new day will dawn 
For those who stand long 
And the forests will echo with laughter. 
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, 
Don't be alarmed now, 
It's just a spring clean for the May queen. 
Yes, there are two paths you can go by 
But in the long run 
There's still time to change the road you're on. 
And it makes me wonder. 
Your head is humming and it won't go 
In case you don't know, 
The piper's calling you to join him, 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, 
And did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How ev'rything still turns to gold. 
And if you listen very hard 
The tune will come to you at last. 
When all are one and one is all 
To be a rock and not to roll. 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.",Stairway to Heaven

It seems so long ago
Nothing changes I know
I thought that I had the world in my hand
It slipped through my fingers
And I thought that I could believe again
But I know
I know 

Our days are running out
The voices still scream
To let us know it's time to die
Over and over again 

And then I realized as I fell to my knees
That all this time I was caught in the middle
And I couldn't see
See through the lies through my bloodshed eyes
And all that I know is that life is bringing me down 

As I reach the end of the rope (over and over again)
And I'm running out of hope (over and over again)
I get more and more out of touch
I lose my faith and await to die",The End

Depuis j'me fais ouij' en moins d'cinq minutes avec E-mule
On trouvait jamais d'meufs, on trainait qu'entre testicules
Maintenant les gens s'regroupent dans les champs pour prendre des pilules
En boite la CC circule, les pédés gesticulent,
Les particules sur les p'tits pulls c'est pas des pellicules
Putain... On dirait qu'ca suffit plus d'fumer des spliffs
Ma génération GameBoy sniffe plus de lignes qu'à Tetris
Depuis qu'on préfère les paquets d'clopes aux paquets d'chips
Le sports d'équipe partent en vrille, y a des grizzlis à Memphis
Maintenant les radios s'torchent avec la playlist
Maintenant faut passer sous l'bureau pour qu'on passe tes disques
Plus la carotte est grosse, plus l'auditeur écarte les cuisses
Le top albums 2006 c'est la banane d'Elvis

Rajoute San derrière et devine qui baise ta mère en 4 lettres
J’veux que les gosses achètent mon disque en criant « mon précieux »
Si t’as pas confiance en moi tant mieux parce qu’on est deux
J’écris des textes comme si c’était des cours pour les vicieux
J’rappe à la sueur de mes boules et mes couplets ont un goût délicieux
J’me réveille avec des p’tits yeux après 19h
Ensuite j’me branle machinalement et j’lis des Hunter X Hunter
Les dep qui disent que je suis homophobe peuvent aller s’faire enculer
Ceux qui marchent pas avec nous peuvent aller s’faire amputer

Mais quand tu me compares à des TTC c’est comme si tu m’manquais de respect
Les féministes me persécutent, me prennent pour Belzébuth
Comme si c’était d’ma faute si les meufs c’est des putes
Elles ont qu’à arreter d’se faire péter le uc
Et m’dire merci parce que j’les éduque, j’leur apprends des vrais trucs
Des fois j’sais plus si j’suis misogyne ou si c’est ironique
J’serai peut etre fixé quand j’arreterai de faire des textes où j’frappe ma p’tite copine
Tous les jours mon boss menace d’me virer d’mon taf

Ma voisine me casse les couilles alors j’menace de tuer son chat

Au pied du mur t’as le choix
Y’en a qui marchent droit
Y’en a qui pètent un câble
Entre bien et mal j’peux gagner le respect en trimant 
Ou faire pareil en trichant
Car toute ta vie tu seras partagé
Entre bien et mal
Au pied du mur t’as le choix
Y’en a qui marchent droit
Y’en a qui pètent un câble
Ou bien tu le fais le mal au final t’es le seul déçu
Ou bien t’es dans le droit chemin et tu te fais marcher dessus
C’est bien

Entre mal et bien j’pourrais braquer ce fourgon et tout sauter
Quitte à supporter les va-et-vient du maton et le bruit de son trousseau de clés
Entre mal et bien je peux t’donner la vie ou te l’ôter
M’en battre les couilles ou voter
Jongler entre chats et chiens bons ou mauvais
Un peu de shit, un peu d’herbe et j’tise ma teille
En galérien pendant que ma daronne se casse les reins pour un salaire de merde
Ok j’pourrais gober leurs propos de crâne rasé
J’préfère rouler ma bosse avec mes potes de couleur basanée
Pourquoi j’irais tromper ma meuf quand j’peux lui mettre un gamin dans le ventre
Et le voir pousser depuis le jardin d’enfant
Entre mal et bien moi j’ai choisi mon camp
Et quitte à stagner dans la dèche
Je préfère travailler dur que taper dans la caisse
J’pourrais profiter de tes faiblesses
Te vendre ma cess ou craquer
Et hop j’agresse cette vieille juste pour lui prendre sa fraîche
Mais j’oublie pas que personne ne part sans payer d’addition
Chacun de mes actes déclenche un effet papillon

Y’en a qui pètent un câble
Ou bien tu le fais le mal au final t’es le seul déçu
Ou bien t’es dans le droit chemin et tu te fais marcher dessus
C’est bien

J’ai fait mon choix entre bien et mal, entre blanc et noir
Depuis que j’préfère traîner dans les bars que faire mes devoirs
J’m’en bats les couilles d’y croire moi j’préfère boire et perdre espoir
J’m’en bats les couilles de faire croquer moi je préfère jouer les stars
J’veux vivre à fond, de toute façon les gentils garçons s’font marcher dessus
J’vis dans l’excès, j’claque mes thunes quitte à m’endetter
J’me laisse contrôler par mon côté animal
J’assouvis mes pulsions, j’me sens attiré par les flammes
J’suis pris dans la spirale, pour me faire du bien j’me fais du mal
J’ai plus envie d’avancer, j’ai juste envie de me mettre une balle
La morale c’est allez tous vous faire baiser
J’préfère détester qu’aimer, j’préfère détruire que d’créer
J’pourrais m’instruire mais j’préfère rien branler devant la télé
J’pourrais trouver l’amour mais je l’échangerais contre n’importe quelle traînée
Entre ciel et terre, c’est le diable qui me tend la main
Donc j’me sers un dernier verre quitte à finir dans le ravin

Entre bien et mal
Au pied du mur t’as le choix
Y’en a qui marchent droit
Y’en a qui pètent un câble
Entre bien et mal j’peux gagner le respect en trimant 
Ou faire pareil en trichant
Car toute ta vie tu seras partagé
Entre bien et mal
Au pied du mur t’as le choix
Y’en a qui marchent droit
Y’en a qui pètent un câble
Ou bien tu le fais le mal au final t’es le seul déçu
Ou bien t’es dans le droit chemin et tu te fais marcher dessus
C’est bien

Dis-moi pourquoi vivre de business et d’inquiétudes
J’déboîte le bac et les études et j’me ferai un sacré paquet de thunes
Les contrôles abusifs me font péter un plomb
Et puis j’me dis que c’est comme chez nous, y’a les bâtards et y’a les bons
J’me lève tous les matins et j’me tue à la tâche 
Parce qu’en marge de l’État, tu pionces en taule ou en salle de réa
J’oublie la flambe et tous mes rêves de gloire
Seul j’aurais l’air de quoi ? J’veux qu’mes parents vieillissent en étant fiers de moi

J’suis prêt à vendre mon âme au diable, à prendre un ticket pour l’enfer
J’attendrai pas d’avoir échouer, j’préfère tout foutre en l’air
Six pieds sous terre, ce sera trop tard, j’veux tout tout de suite
Orienté dans la mauvaise voix entre une bouteille et un bout de shit
Si les bons partent en premier j’compte vivre longtemps
Prendre du bon temps, baiser la vie avec ou sans consentement
Choisis ton camp, moi j’marcherai jamais dans le droit chemin
J’tafferai jamais comme un chien parce qu’on peut tout perdre du jour au lendemain

Entre bien et mal
Au pied du mur t’as le choix
Y’en a qui marchent droit
Y’en a qui pètent un câble
Entre bien et mal j’peux gagner le respect en trimant 
Ou faire pareil en trichant
Car toute ta vie tu seras partagé
Entre bien et mal
Au pied du mur t’as le choix
Y’en a qui marchent droit
Y’en a qui pètent un câble
Ou bien tu le fais le mal au final t’es le seul déçu
Ou bien t’es dans le droit chemin et tu te fais marcher dessus
C’est bien",Entre Bien et Mal
Orelsan,"Hé! Pour les 3 prochaines minutes, j’veux qu’on m’appelle Jimmy Punchline

C’est le retour de la légende de Jimmy 
Meme si j’peux craquer à tout moment comme les jambes de Djibril 
2008 j’lance le missile
Si t’écoutais pas d’rap en 98 change de vinyle 
Parce que je kiffe les prod à l’ancienne nique la mode
J’viens kicker comme quand j’kickais pour demarrer ma Vogue
Cherche pas de messages dans mes phases, dans mes métaphores
J’fais ca pour le plaisir parce que j’trouve que j’déchire
J’représente le 7
J’écris des textes tirés par les cheveux comme ta meuf en levrette
J’crache le feu sur ta bande de traitres
C’est le remake de Sodome et Gomorrhe, un holocauste sonore
J’suis trop gore pour le grand public
De toute facon j’m’en branle des Victoires de la Musique
J’vise les Hots d’Or
Tous les jours j’me couche aux aurores 
Et j’pars au taf avec une gueule d’enterrement comme si j’étais croque-mort
J’suis les Beatles pour les jeunes ados
J’pourrais passer sur Sky meme si mon single s’appelait Fun Radio
J’crache dans tes règles ca fait ketchup/mayo
J’te baise sur un tas de bois, t’attrapes une syphilis de derrière les fagots
J’distribuais des cd dans l’hexagone 
Pendant que tu distribuais tes CV dans les MacDo 
Alors je comprends que tu voudrais faire un feat
Mais moi j’voudrais un BicMac et une grande frite
Et ca fait 1 pour mon estomac 2 pour ma bite
Basse Normandie 14000 tu sais où j’habite
Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy vient t’ôter la vie
J’t’envoie en shimmy shimmy yo chimiothérapie
Oui c’est gratuit j’suis bete et méchant
Si j’dois mettre des gants j’t’arrache la jugulaire avec les dents
Et quand on fait la fete chez tes parents ca part en tapage nocturne
On fait tourner l’cul d’la vieille alors que personne fume
Laisse-moi prendre ma respiration
J’devrais etre sponso MSN, tout le monde prend mes citations
Trouve-moi en pleine méditation dans un débit de boissons
Ma gueule de bois ferait passer Pinocchio pour un vrai petit garcon

J’écris des tubes à l’encre de banane
J’te refile des trucs via l’antre de ta femme
T’arrives à rapper super vite, pas mal
Mais si t’as du flow pas d’paroles tu seras jamais plus fort que SkatMan
T’aurais dû arreter le rap au lieu d’arreter l’école
T’aurais dû lâcher la musique au lieu de lâcher des comm’
J’ai un truc énorme entre les jambes comme un contrebassiste
Aussi vrai qu’t’es pas francais si t’as pas un oncle raciste
J’débarque comme un tsunami
Tu vois défiler défiler défiler défiler toute ta vie
Oudelali j’te fais passer sous le baby
Ton équipe fait pitié comme un orphelinat en Roumanie
J’rappe sous ti punch et les ladies bougent leur punany
Arreter de mouiller j’ai l’impression de baiser sous la pluie
J’arrive tete de gondole texte de mongol
Tu bouges ta bete de coupe au bol
Avec ma p’tite copine on s’pète la tete au gin
J’la baise complètement dead comme si j’étais nécrophile
J’la trompe que dans les autres villes ca compte pas
Haltérophile sexuel j’soulève des meufs qui font deux fois mon poids
J’traine avec des futurs médecins et des ex-taulards
Skreaddy Krueger à la prod et j’suis ton pire cauchemar
Gringe et Skread c’est Baudelaire et Mozart
Ablaye va te refaire le portrait et il a jamais fait les Beaux Arts
Je vénère les femmes à tete de chienne comme les Égyptiens
J’déteste les trav depuis que j’ai failli kène un brésilien
Continue de rapper des mythos tu le fais si bien
Tu parles de douilles et de plombs mais t’es électricien
Bref si t’as des couplets de merde bosse le Si c’est ca le rap game j’dois etre le boss de fin
Si tu veux pomper Saint Valentin commence par avoir des rapports
Puceau t’as du mal à baiser ta propre main
Dans la nouvelle scène j’suis le seul qui sort du lot
J’suis l’seul écrivain potable depuis Victor Hugo
J’marche sur l’eau j’nage sur le bitume
Et ca fait 3 minutes Jimmy Punchline 7th Magnitude

Jimmy Punchline
J’suis la définition du mot Punchline",Jimmy Punchline
Orelsan,"Et c’est parti pour le show
Interro surprise, j’viens donner des cours de flow
Leur musique tourne en rond, tourne en rond comme une course de chevaux
J’veux percer pour qu’ma vie soit plus qu’un long jour de repos
Orelsan, orelsan dans tes oreilles sales
J’espère que mon label a pas misé sur l’mauvais cheval
C’est ma chanson commerciale, si tu veux jacter, jacte
Mais c’est pas avec « changement » qu’on allait retourner les boites

Si tu vois mon logo dans le ciel, augmente les watts au maximum
Bouge ton corps dans tous les sens comme si t’avais parkison
J’ai plus de style qu’il y a de gel dans ta crete
J’veux plus de filles qu’il y a de sperme dans ta couette
Les rappeurs.Fr veulent me copier-coller
En 3 clips j’ai fait plus de buzz sur le net que google
J’écris meme plus, j’rentre en transe en cabine et ca sort tout seul

Si tu vois mon logo dans le ciel, j’débarque, j’débarque
Orelsan
Qui c’est qu’on appelle 
Orelsan

J’ai tout mis dans le premier album, y aura pas d’deuxième
Voilà le single, j’envoie le jingle comme pat le guen
L’épicerie d’nuit m’rackette pour un pack d’heineken
Mais tous les jours d’la semaine, j’suis back again
Dans ma base secrète (dans ma base secrète)
J’baise des meufs avec la dentition d’l’âne de shrek
J’ai la frappe de ken (j’ai la frappe de ken)
J’applique la stratégie d’l’échec, l’art de perdre

Si tu vois mon logo dans le ciel, j’viens sauver l’monde

J’fais bouger la foule comme une alerte à la bombe
J’veux des nouvelles pompes, j’veux des nouvelles pump
Des air force one, des air jordan ou des nouvelles dunk
J’suis l’caillou dans la boule de neige
J’veux qu’les poules me lèchent
J’veux plus jamais que mes couilles ne sèchent
J’viens mettre ma ville de caen sur la carte
Orel pour mon prénom, san pour les putes asiats

Si tu vois mon logo dans le ciel, j’débarque, j’débarque
Orelsan
Qui c’est qu’on appelle

Un signal de lumière dans la nuit comme un appel à l’aide
Si tu t’ennuies seul dans ta ville, qui c’est qu’on appelle ?

Viens pour sauver la terre

106 kid, kitté batmobile
Depuis qu’j’passe sur mtv les chattes me bippent
Avant elles m’trouvaient naze, maintenant elles me trouvent mignon
C’est l’effet porte papillon sur la pochette 
2-3 punchline en stock j’arrive bourré comme hancock
Non j’suis pas le meilleur rappeur mais j’suis sûrement dans le top
J’mets l’industrie en cloque, c’est l’attaque des clones
Une armée d’orel falsh en toc

Orelsan,"J’ai peur de jamais finir mon album j’ai plus d’inspi
D’façon j’ai plus envie de devenir chanteur, j’ai plus quinze piges
Quand j’regarde mes clips j’trouve qu’j’fais pitié
C’que j’raconte dans mes chansons c’est des clichés c’est pas la vérité
La célébrité m’fait peur
J’ai peur d’me griller les ailes à vouloir briller sous les projecteurs
Au fond, j’m’en bats pas les couilles d’c’que disent les gens
J’me perds entre c’qu’ils attendent de moi et ce qu’j’suis vraiment
Tous les jours j’fais l’acteur, j’fais semblant
J’maquille la peur en plaisantant
J’perds mon temps à m’poser des questions au lieu d’agir
J’ai peur de la dépression, j’ai peur de l’avenir et ses déceptions
Plus j’grandis, plus l’temps passe et plus j’suis déçu
Sous l’emprise de l’angoisse des futures blessures
Plus j’me cherche des excuses, plus j’m’enlise
J’m’enivre de négativité et j’me sens vivre
Souvent, j’ai peur de l’ennui
J’ai peur d’avoir aucune raison d’me plaindre pourtant j’me sens triste
Tout le temps j’me sens vide j’ai peur d’être normal d’être moyen
Ni trop mal ni trop bien, j’crois qu’j’sers à rien
J’ai peur de mes proches parce qu’ils connaissant mes faiblesses
Mes talons d’Achille, ils savent à quel point mes fondations sont fragiles
Ils m’font confiance pour l’instant
Mais quand j’les décevrai, ils seront près de moi prêts à frapper les premiers
J’ai peur que mes parents m’détestent
Depuis que j’ai treize ans j’régresse, j’les blesse, j’les stresse,
J’délaisse c’qu’ils m’ont appris pour faire que d’la merde
Comme si j’valais mieux qu’mon père, comme si j’valais mieux qu’ma mère
Eux croient qu’ils m’aiment, moi j’crois qu’ils se voilent la face
J’crois qu’ils aiment celui qu’ils rêvent de voir à ma place
Parce qu’ils savent pas c’qu’il s’passe derrière le masque
Qui s’cache derrière l’image, parce qu’ils connaissent pas mon vrai visage
Quand j’dis qu’j’déteste les filles j’me donne du crédit
J’me suis vraiment jamais investi, j’ai fui
J’ai triché sur mes sentiments en croyant rester vrai
J’ esquivé l’amour par peur de m’faire baiser
On dirait qu’plus j’m’attachais moins ça marchait
J’ai trahi, j’ai sali, j’ai haï, j’ai banni
Qu’est ce que j’ai acquis à part des remords et des maladies
Rien à part la peur de rester seul toute ma vie
J’crois un peu en Dieu mais pas vraiment
J’irai avec les mécréants quand j’partirai les pieds devant
J’ai peur d’être attiré par le néant
J’me sens tellement bien dans la noirceur, j’me sens dans mon élément
J’ai comme envie d’sauter dans l’vide, d’me passer la corde au cou
D’me noyer, d’m’entailler les veines du coude au poignet
J’ai comme envie d’me mettre une balle dans le crâne mais j’ai pas de flingue
Regarde moi dans les yeux tu comprendras qu’j’suis qu’une baltringue

J’ai peur de perdre
J’ai peur de l’échec
J’ai peur d’affronter les épreuves de la vie
J’ai peur de mes erreurs j’ai peur de l’avenir",Peur de l'Échec
Orelsan,"Parce qu'en fait j'ai pas eu d'rapports depuis des mois
J'recherche une fille un peu facile un peu naïve qui voudrait sortir avec moi
Physiquement tu m'attires pas plus que ca
Mais j'taperais dans n'importe quoi
J'ai l'intention d'te faire tiser
Jusqu'à c'que tu veuilles bien dormir chez moi
J'irai jamais décrocher la lune pour tes yeux
Mais quitte à rien branler autant le faire tous les deux
Ouh ouh ouh j'veux qu'tu sois plus ou moins ma p'tite copine
En attendant d'avoir trouver mieux

J'vais pas t'mentir
Oh j'suis pas vraiment ton prince charmant
Si tu veux bien sortir avec moi c'est pour le pire
J'ai rien à t'offrir à part des mauvais souvenirs
Ca sera p't'etre pas tous les jours la fete
Je suis qu'un homme j'réfléchis pas toujours avec ma tete
Maintenant tu sais à quoi t'en t'nir
Si tu veux bien sortir avec moi c'est pour le pire

Oublie tes reves d'ado
J'oublie ton anniversaire pour esquiver le cadeau
J'paye meme pas le Mac Do
Si tu cherches un beau gosse, sportif et romantique c'est raté
Parait qu'j'suis juste un pauvre type égocentrique
Si ta meilleure copine est bonne j'essaierai d'l'attraper
Si je me fais cramer j'dirai qu'c'est elle qui m'a dragué
J'serai gentil quand t'auras bien travailler
Un bouquet d'fleurs de rond point, j'débarque chez toi quand j'ai plus rien à grailler
J'fais ni l'ménage ni la cuisine
Si on va au cinéma c'est toi qui payes c'est moi qui choisis l'film
Si on va en boite c'est sans toi
Parce que si j'rencontre n'importe quelle meuf consentante j'rentre dans l'tas
J'préfère te dire la vérité
Oublie les clichés d'amour de série-b
On pourrais p't'etre kiffer t'es p't'etre ma destinée
Mais j'te quitterai dès qu'j'trouve une chienne avec un meilleur pédigree

J'vais pas t'mentir
Oh j'suis pas vraiment ton prince charmant
Si tu veux bien sortir avec moi c'est pour le pire
J'ai rien à t'offrir à part des mauvais souvenirs
Ca sera p't'etre pas tous les jours la fete
Je suis qu'un homme j'réfléchis pas toujours avec ma tete
Maintenant tu sais à quoi t'en t'nir
Si tu veux bien sortir avec moi c'est pour le pire

Bon des fois j'me tromperai de nom
Parce que je kiffe encore mon ex alors j't'appellerai p't'etre par son prénom
Des fois j'rentrerai à l'aube avec 12 grammes dans le sang
D'temps en temps je penserai à une autre quand on couchera ensemble
Tu verras jamais mes parents et j'veux pas rencontrer les tiens
J'veux pas qu'on crée des liens j'te préviens
Si tu me dis je t'aime j'répondrai je t'aime bien
Si tu veux des câlins dès l'matin, c'est mort j'dors j'fais rien
Si tu cherches quelqu'un pour confier tes problèmes, suis une thérapie
J'ai plus de batterie dès qu'tu commences à raconter ta vie
Si tu crois qu't'es enceinte, j'disparais comme par magie
J'aurai changé d'adresse avant qu'tu sois rentrée de la pharmacie
C'est l'amour à sens unique,
Je donne pas d'signes d'affection en public
Tu passes après mes potes et ma musique
ca commence par bébé, p'tite puce, princesse, mon ange
ca finit par où t'était p'tite (bip), quand est-ce qu'on mange?

J'vais pas t'mentir
Oh j'suis pas vraiment ton prince charmant
Si tu veux bien sortir avec moi c'est pour le pire
J'ai rien à t'offrir à part des mauvais souvenirs
ca sera p't'etre pas tous les jours la fete
Je suis qu'un hommej'réfléchis pas toujours avec ma tete
Maintenant tu sais à quoi t'en t'nir
Si tu veux bien sortir avec moi c'est pour le pire

J'suis pas ton prince charmant j'suis pas ton prince charmant",Pour le Pire
Orelsan,"T'es pas le plus beau gosse de la terre
T'a pas d'salaire, t'a pas d'quoi te payer plus d'deux trois verres
Toutes les s'maines dans la meme boite avec les meme Nike Air
Avec les meme videur qui t'mettent les memes galères
Tu dragues les memes ados, c'est un fiasco
Parce que t'es trop déchiré pour aligner 3 mots
Si tu danses comme un naze toi et moi on est pareil
Demain on prendra l'temps d'regretter c'qu'on a fait la veille
On sera p't'etre jamais V.I.P
On baisera jamais des betes de schnecks à Miami
On s'en bat les couilles on tise on vit la nuit
On rentre à pieds parce qu'on a jamais d'quoi payer le taxi

Encore une soirée où j'vais rentrer seul chez moi
Encore un soir où j'vais finir dans un sale état
J'essaye d'avoir l'air cool mais j'arrive juste a m'afficher
Ca m'empeche pas d'kiffer
Deux jours plus tard j'suis de retour pour passer la meme soirée ratée

On fait la meme chose toutes les semaines
On sait qu'sa va etre naze mais on sort quand meme
On fait la meme chose toutes les semaines
Tous c'qu'on ramène à la maison c'est des problèmes

Les consos sont hors de prix
Au fond de la salle ton ex-meuf sort avec n'importe qui
T'a des sapes de merde et une gueule assortie
Les trois-quart de la boite veulent ta tete à la sortie
T'à pas d'bouteille donc pas d'table pour t'asseoir
Tu fais cotiser tes potes pour qu'ils t'payent à boire
On est pareil si tu fais peine à voir

Si tu fumes ton forfait en appelant toutes les filles du répertoire
Ca s'passe jamais comme dans les clips
J'connais personne qui rentre en boite en équipe
Retour à la réalité, recalé à l'entrée
La fete est finie alors qu'elle a jamais commencé

Encore une soirée où j'vais rentrer seul chez moi
Encore un soir où j'vais finir dans un sale état
J'essaye d'avoir l'air cool mais j'arrive juste a m'afficher

Y a pas d'barre de strip-tease y a que des p'tites grosses qui tisent au bar
Qui font des truc bizarres après trois Whisky-Coca
Tu t'endors sur une banquette au bord du coma
Renverse ton verre imprègne ton t-shirt de vodka
Dehors y'a plus de musique
Plus d'repères tu titubes tu perds l'équilibre ta tete percute le bitume
Demain t'auras le moral à zéro, attrapé froid
Tu t'rapelleras meme pas comment t'es rentré jusqu'à chez toi

Orelsan,"Bonsoir à tous et bienvenu sur la RapLine
L'émission la plus afrocentrique du PAF
Samedi soir tard comme toutes les semaines
La semaine dernière, c'était l'émission numéro 26, et souvenez-vous
on avait retrouvé Suprême NTM et puis IAM leur concurrent
Cette semaine, c'est un peu différent
On va retrouver celui qui s'est révélé avec un premier album intitulé ""Perdu d'avance""
Le second qui sort le 26 septembre 92 s'intitule ""Le chant des sirènes""
Qui est donc ce nouveau venu dans la scène du Rap Français?
Vous allez le découvrir sur la RapLine, voici Monsieur Orelsan

Tchiki tchek le mic quand j'arrive dans la session
Comme mon survêt Adidas, j'augmente la pression
Dans les années 90, nouvelle génération
Ils disent qu'on est des fous parce qu'on écoute nos walkmans à fond
Passe-moi le cro-mi
Que je me serve de ma tête comme le but de Basile Boli
Que je big up big up one love à tout mon possee
J'traine avec plus d'étoiles que si j'étais dans Shinobi
Quand tu vois nos styles dans nos vidéoclips
Les wacks MCs font leur valise comme Groquick
Tout va trop vite, nouvelles technologies
Beeper, tatoo, tam-tam, COBE oh oui
J'utilise plus de bandes qu'une momie
J'écris des rimes sales comme Dolly
Golden
Le RPR trouve ma musique
Obscène
Mais je serai bientôt dans le top 50 avec ma paire de Top Ten
Est-ce que je mens?
Nan
Est-ce qu'on baissera nos futes pour quelques francs?
Nan
Pervers j'ai le cerveau près des couilles comme Krang
Mais j'ai de la bonne poudre comme Tang
Quand on arrive dans la base tout le monde met les mains en l'air assuré
Comme si j'étais le roi de la pomme de terre j'envoie la purée
Toi-même tu sais mon DJ devrait s'appeler Ovomaltine
Boom c'est de la dynamite aux platines

Orelsan,"Hé Skread! Balance cette merde rétro-futuriste!
Konichiwa je suis de retour depuis six mois je m’isole
Je ai regardé One Piece 8 fois, les 460 épisodes
Une sorte de blanc qui se prend pour un chintoc
Je essaye de sortir plus de classiques que les usines Reebok
Un cyborg version 2.0
Je suis toujours dans les temps comme ton père à l’heure de l’apéro
Orelsan c’est Aurélien je ai pas de alter-égo
De toute façon y en avait pas un pour rattraper l’autre
Pourquoi tu me donnes ta démo, je suis pas producteur
Avant que tu me parles je étais de bonne humeur
Charme destructeur je frappe pas je engrosse une sœur
Je traîne avec une bande d’enfoiré mais on file que dalle aux Resto du Cœur
C’est pas du rap de geek, c’est pas du rap comique
C’est la musique d’un type en passe de devenir alcoolique
Je écris avec le sang d’une vierge des versets diaboliques
Je viens détourner plus de gosses que l’Église Catholique
Tu me verras pas aux Francofolies
Mais tu peux me trouver chez le psy en train de discuter de ma transophobie
On m’a dit tais-toi, nettoies (hé!)
Pauvre conne! Lèches-moi les noix!
Cochonne! Mets-toi des doigts!
Je veux faire des tubes en restant moi-même et je garde espoir
Je préfère bosser au Macdo qu’avoir la plume de Grégoire
Je ai la fraîcheur du terroir moi jeunesse du
Shit, des scooters, des bières, des baggy, des superstars
Des textes sur mes devoirs
Trois bandes blanches sur un survête noir
Mes défaites font mes plus belles gloires
Je aime voir l’amour dans les yeux d’une fille
Avant qu’mes spermatozoïdes cherchent à féconder sa pupille
Je suis pas là pour me faire des amis
Je préfère extorquer des gamines suicidaire featuring Jena Lee
Je ai à peu près la même réputation que Cheb Mami
Tant pis comme disent les cainris ""C’est la vie!""
Je viens de Caen ça s’entend je ai l’accent Bas-Normand
Je parle lentement je ai un coup de barre depuis mes 14ans
(Ton album ça sort quand?)
Pitié tu l’auras sûrement téléchargé avant que je ai fini de l’enregistrer
Mais qu’est-ce que tu sais faire à part cliquer
A part critiquer, à part flipper d’te faire griller ton Adresse IP
Ils font pas du rap conscient ils racontent le JT
Rien à foutre de la bonne cause je suis contre le Tibet
Quand je suis sur scène je veux t’entendre crier ""Orelsan!""
Quand je baise je veux t’entendre crier ""Orelsan!""
Des mots des phrases, des mauvaises phases
Des métaphores, des mauvaises vannes
Bientôt je arrête je dépose les armes je commence à m’ennuyer
Je fais que toute la nuit je écris je gratte du papier
Je relève à 15h, je relis, je trouve ça nulle à chier
Le rap je le quitterai de la même façon qu’l’ai kiffé
Mon nom à moi c’est Orelsan oui tu l’as deviné

2010 Maintenant je rap comme je veux
Parce qu’on est en 2010
2010 je me laisse pouser les cheveux
Parce qu’on est en 2010
2010 je porte plus de XXXL
Parce qu’on est en 2010
Y a des voitures qui volent dans le ciel

Haaan la honte!
T’es trop à l’ancienne 2010
Hé c’est fini on est en 2012 maintenant
Ouai je sais mais je m’en fou parce qu’on est en 2010",2010
Orelsan,"J'entends le chant des sirènes
Regarde autour de moi tous ces gens qui m'aiment
Je veux toucher le soleil avant que la pluie ne vienne
T'inquiètes pas seuls les faibles se font bouffer par le système

Pour la quatrième fois de la semaine
Et c'est même pas le week-end

Tous mes vieux potes subissent la merde de la vie quotidienne

Je rêvais d'être connu en jouant aux petites voitures
Maintenant les labels et les groupies veulent ma signature
Oui j'assure, je suis le génie qui a écrit ""Sale Pute""
J'aimais pas l'adolescence, laisse moi kiffer ma vie d'adulte

Des bises, des poignets de mains, des sourires hypocrites
Reprends une bouteille, les deux premières sont parties trop vite
Sous champagne personne n'écoute mais les gens parlent
Dis-moi qui tu connais, je te dirai si t'es fréquentable

Loin du commun des mortels, tellement loin
En route vers le succès je me fais sucer dans le train
Je trouve la plénitude au sens propre complètement plein
De l'autre côté du petit écran, je laisse mes empreintes parmi les grands

J'entends le chant des sirènes
Regarde autour de moi tous ces gens qui m'aiment
Je veux toucher le soleil avant que la pluie ne vienne
T'inquiètes pas seuls les faibles se font bouffer par le système

J'entends le chant des sirènes
Regarde autour de moi tous ces gens qui m'aiment
Je veux toucher le soleil avant que la pluie ne vienne
T'inquiètes pas seuls les faibles se font bouffer par le système

Mes potes disent que je change, moi je dis que j'évolue
Cette époque où j'étais perdu d'avance est révolue
Je prends même plus la peine d'avoir une opinion
Je fais des copier-coller de discussions, je crée l'illusion

Je pars toucher l'horizon à dos de vodka bison
Mais le temps passe je reste en place et le soleil change de position
Un pote attend mes mandats dans sa prison
Pendant que je suis dans un dîner mondain entrain de régler l'addition

Quand je parle de mon prochain disque les yeux de mes fans s'illuminent
Le problème c'est que j'ai toujours pas écrit une ligne
J'ai la chanteuse du moment en featuring
Y a deux ans je l'aurais sûrement insultée au fil d'une rime

De plus en plus de vautours me tournent autour
Au secours ça commence à sentir la fin des beaux jours
J'ai pas téléphoné pour l'anniversaire de ma sœur
Alors que j'appelle mon manager toutes les trois heures

Ma meuf pète un câble, veut qu'on passe du temps tous les deux
Moi je suis au Cap d'Agde dans la Chatte du Diable (dans la Chatte du Diable)
Un dernier verre et je touche les cieux
Tous mes vieux, je pars en voyage des valises sous les yeux

J'entends le chant des sirènes
Regarde autour de moi tous ces gens qui m'aiment
Je veux toucher le soleil avant que la pluie ne vienne
T'inquiètes pas seuls les faibles se font bouffer par le système

Déprimé, dans un bar cannais, vidé
Je regarde mon téléphone en rêvant qu'il se remette à vibrer
Parfois un vieux pote m'appelle mais c'est plus pareil
Parfois mon ex m'appelle, j'aurais pas dû la perdre

Les requins avec qui je taffais, les suceurs qui me grattaient
M'ont poussé à cracher un deuxième disque raté
Pendant que je buvais du champagne pour me déshydrater
Je vivais dans le passé des nouveaux artistes m'ont remplacé

Mes ex-fans déçus cherchent le Orelsan du début
Mais même-moi je crois que je l'ai perdu
Mon banquier m'avait prévenu, les impôts vont te foutre à terre
A quel moment j'ai cru que j'allais passer au travers

Je suis passé de la vie d'une mini star au connard de l'histoire
A Caen, je suis rien de plus qu'un gros poisson dans une petite marre
Fête chaque victoire mais y a un juste milieu
Apprends à remonter la pente avant d'entrer dans un cercle vicieux

Où sont passées les sirènes
Regarde autour de moi tous ces gens remplis de haine
Après l'ivresse vient la migraine
Au final je crois que je me suis fait bouffer par le système

Ils sont soit au poste, soit à l'hosto
Soit ils dorment et je suis parano
Je dois me faire des film
Je passe au McDo, je prend deux verres pour le trajet
Je rentre a pied, je réfléchis
Dix neuf heures on étaient dans le bars, normal c'étais jeudi
Vingt deux heure ça parle fort, ça boit des demis
Minuit j'arrive plus vraiment à contrôler ce que je dis 
Une heure, je croise un pote, je passe chez lui

Allo
Ouais t'as essayé de m'appeller?
Ouais, on a fait quoi hier soir, je me rappelle de rien
Rien de spécial, on était déchirés! T'as dormis chez la meuf là?
Ouais, c'est qui? 
Une meuf qu'étais chez Simone
D’ailleurs t'aurais jamais du fumer sur ça weed tu sais qu'il la charge a mort
Ah ouais j'ai fumé?
Ouais
Je devais vraiment être bourrer
Grave, d’ailleurs après on c'est pointé au ""Farniente""
Et comme on étais 5 gars trop fatigué on s'est fait recalé direct!
Et après?
Et après Claude il a insulté le videur
C'est partis en couille
Toi ta voulus les séparé tu t'es pris un middle kick dans l'bordel
Ah merde
Et après tout le monde est rentré
ta rappeler ta princesse et t'es rentré chez elle a pied
Oh merde!
Tu fait quoi là?
Là je rentre chez moi 
OK parce que ce soir c'est l'anniv de bouteille on sort, on se retrouve à 19h?

J’ai enfin trouvé une meuf avec qui je pourrais faire un truc sérieux
Je crois qu’elle est spéciale, je crois que je commence à me faire vieux
C’est pas vraiment la fille de mes rêves, mais c’est peut-être mieux
Elle est simple, elle est belle, elle est bien réelle
Quand je veux être au calme, je squatte chez elle
Elle fait le ménage et la cuisine, je fais les courses et la vaisselle
On matte des séries, des films, on fume, on discute, on rigole
On picole, on descend les bouteilles de vin blanc les moins chères de Lidl
Je suis pas au point d’écrire des poèmes,
Mais si elle me prend le bras quand on se promène ça ne me pose plus de problème
Elle bosse le soir pour payer ses cours de droit
19 mois, on s’est pris la tête deux fois, à cause de moi
C’est ma petite chérie, ma petite poupée
Le meilleur rapport qualité prix que j’ai trouvé
Je pourrais presque l’épouser, sauf qu’elle m’excite pas,
J’arrête pas de la tromper dès qu’elle a le dos tourné

Mon ex était bonne, mais mon ex était folle
Elle me séquestrait des heures au téléphone
Je l’ai jamais vu faire aucun effort
Elle donnait des ordres, piquait des crises, cassait des trucs, claquait des portes
Fouillait mes poches, enquêtait des mes boîtes mails,
Menaçait de se suicider toutes les trois semaines
Une belle feignasse, une jolie petite conne
Elle a quitté l’école pour, squatter les terrasses
Pour, se mettre des races, des traces à base d’alcool, à base de drogue
Pour claquer l’argent de ses parents dans sa garde-robe
Je l’aimais bien mais je l’ai quitté sans regret
On n’était pas compatible, on aurait fini par s'entre-tuer
Mais quand on le faisait après s’être engueulé
C’était beau, c’était magnifique, apocalyptique
J’ai une mi-molle rien que d’en parler, je vais l’appeler, je vais craquer
Ma moitié va encore devoir me partager

Je mène une double vie
Celle avec ma petite amie et celle avec les autres filles
Je mène une double vie, une double vie
Et je sais déjà comment ça va finir, mal!

Je suis torturé, attiré par mon côté obscure
Le sexe c’est une drogue dure, j’arrêterai bien les aventures nocturnes
Mais je trouve toujours une excuse pour faire un nouveau truc tordu
Je suis pas mûr pour fonder une famille, d’accord
Mais c’est pas une raison pour serrer chaque fille qui m’aborde
Non, c’est hardcore, je suis même plus jaloux
Je vois même presque plus le rapport entre la baise et l’amour
Je veux surtout pas qu’elle apprenne que je la trompe,
Par contre, je veux pas lui faire de la peine, c’est la seule que j’aime
Les autres c’est pour le sport
Même si ça changera pas grand chose quand elle voudra me foutre dehors

Orelsan,"La mort s’en bat les couilles de ta vie
Si t’as pas fait ton sac elle viendra te chercher quand-même
Je voudrais croire aux miracles, aux tours de magie
Mais c’est qu’un peu de trucages et beaucoup de mise en scènes
La mort s’en bat les couilles de ta vie

Souvent la froideur de la vérité vient m’embrasser
Rien n’a de sens on peut que regarder le temps passer
Y’a pas longtemps j’imaginais même pas clamser
Mais plus le sablier s’écoule et moins ça me semble abstrait
Angoissé, en pleine nuit le sang glacé
Le plus dur c’est pas le cauchemar c’est l’instant d’après
C’est l’instant de clarté
Ou je suis persuadé qu’y a plus qu’un grand vide quand elle vient t’embarquer
Les gens à fond dans le train-train quotidien
Leur fin, comment ça se fait qu’ils l’acceptent aussi bien
Tout paraît absurde, presque ironique
Vivre d’une manière carré comme si mourir était la suite logique
Elle me hante à en devenir gothique
Je lis des chroniques scientifiques voir l’avancé des corps bioniques
Le Big-bang, l’évolution, les hommes préhistoriques
Face au mystique, l’ésotérique, les délires cosmiques
Choisis ta voix
Entre Kurt Cobain et Buddha deux façons d’atteindre le Nirvana
Chaque fois que j’regarde les étoiles j’me dis t’emballe pas
T’façon c’est qu’du gaz autant faire un vœu devant ton écran plasma
Et j’y pense la plupart du temps
Peut-être parce que j’fume depuis que j’ai 15 ans
Peut-être parce que j’crache du sang
Impuissant, si Dieu n’existe pas j’brasse du vent
Si Dieu existe j’trouve pas ça vraiment plus rassurant
C’est marqué noir sur blanc
Au grand tournoi du Paradis on ira sûrement même pas sur le banc
J’ai du mal à croire la Bible même si j’aime ses enseignements
La mort c’est la finale, le sommeil c’est l’entrainement
J’ai peur de la faucheuse, du Roi des ombres
Peur de la trotteuse, la vitesse à laquelle passe les secondes
Avant de partir on me demandera des comptes
J’prépare la réponse
J’répare mes tuiles avant que le toit ne s’effondre
Plus j’approche du bonheur plus j’ai peur qu’elle vienne
Comme si j’avais peur d’être aveugle après que le soleil s’éteigne
Est-ce que mes croyances et mes pensées sont les miennes
Ou je reste influencé par 2000 ans d’éducation chrétienne
Trop d’égo pour croire que la Terre tourne sans ma présence
Mais j’me rappelle que j’me rappelle pas d’avant ma naissance
J’crois au sixième sens, aux visions sous psychotropes
J’crois qu’ton cerveau déraille quand tu stresses ou qu’t’as pris trop de drogues
J’crois qu’en la vérité des microscopes
Celle qui dit qu’tout est fini quand y’a plus de montagnes sur l’oscilloscope
J’aimerai avoir l’espoir de croire au surnaturel
Avoir le confort de m’en remettre à la grâce du ciel
Mon grand-père a de l’humidité sur chaque prunelle
Parce qu’il connaît la cruauté de faire partie de la race humaine
Y’aura pas d’tunnel, pas d’lumière, pas d’rivière, pas d’ange après qu’elle t’emmène
Et pourtant elle viendra quand-même",Elle Viendra Quand Même

Habiter dans la chambre chez tes parents
Quand t’as dépassé la barre de tes 24 ans
Donne vite le sentiment que la vie se répète
Comme poster sur les murs crient «défaite»

Mon père a des tonnes de nouvelles réflexions
Bien évidemment ma mère pose des questions
Je donne des versions en ma faveur
Devant mes potes je sors mon grand jeu d’acteur

Mais tout seul je me laisse aller dans le malheur
Tout seul je comprends sa vrai valeur
Je téléphone, j’envoie des messages tous les quarts d’heure
Mauvais numéro, je voulais brûler l’opérateur
""Ce numéro téléphone""

Je te jure je t’aime, je veux que tu me reviennes, je veux que tu me reprennes
Juste une deuxième chance, l’ignorance est l’une des pires souffrance

Dis-moi que je suis le pire des enculés que la Terre ait jamais porté

Pourquoi c’est pas comme d’habitude?
On s’engueule elle me crache à la figure
Je lui retourne le crâne en 3 minutes
Les draps nous consolent après chaque dispute

La zapper c’est trop tôt, tous les chemins dans mes pensées me ramènent à elle
Chaque vielle photo de nous deux me fait l’effet d’un mauvais rappel
Pourquoi tous les bons souvenirs n’étaient pas là quand je goûtais les plaisirs charnels
Pourquoi tous les bons souvenirs ne m’empêchaient pas d’assouvir mes envies malsaines

Tous les matins sont pires que la veille
Seul depuis des mois aucun appel
Mais je savais que j’allais perdre ce jeu
Comme si j’en avais marre d’être heureux

J’erre sans but comme un petit autiste
L’air triste, seul face à la Nature comme Bear Grylls
Je tease, je passe les même disques en boucle
Ces vielles chansons d’amour qui parlent de vivre en couple

Dépité, déprimé, chh, déchiré, je suis dans le tambour de la machine, lessivé
Les neurones complètement grillés, vrillés
Je regarde les bouteilles s’empiler, je remplie des cendriers
Des jours entiers, tourmenté les yeux fixés sur le plafond
Laisse moi tout changer, j’ai compris la leçon

Je tourne en rond, je tourne en rond, je tourne en rond
Je m’enfonce complètement
Je donnerai tout ce que j’ai contre une machine à remonter le temps

Sadique avec une tête d'ange un charisme étrange
T'enchaînais plus de filles que la traite des blanches
Tu voulais devenir basketteur
Et tu t'es découragé quand t'as compris que t'étais pas le meilleur
Un peu comme le reste maintenant tu cherches ta jeunesse face à tes peurs
Sur une montagne d'erreurs

(Ah ah ah ah ah)
J'ai l'impression de faire la morale (ah ah ah ah ah)
Ça m'énerve moi même quand je cause (ah ah ah ah ah)
Mais j'ai l'impression que ça va mal (ah ah ah ah ah)
Même si je peux pas faire grand chose (ah ah ah ah ah)

Combien de wagon, combien de trains t'as raté
Comment faire pour les rattraper
Allonger dans 15 mètres carrés à te demander ou sont passer les 10 dernières années
Tu vis sur les aides, tu vis sur les nerfs
Tu supportes plus qu'on te chambre, tu t'énerves
Les jours se ressemblent, tu te réveille
Avec une boule dans le ventre tu fais des tours dans le centre
Comme si y avait des trucs à faire en ville
Tu poses un CV pour avoir la conscience tranquille
Mais t'aurais sûrement plus de chance de trouver du taff en écrivant ton nom sur une feuille blanche
Les filles faciles voulait vivre une passion
Maintenant elles veulent une vie de famille, une situation
Le moindre rendez-vous c'est une mission
Quand ton cerveau ralentit, anéanti par le feignantise

(Ah ah ah ah ah)
J'ai l'impression de faire la morale (ah ah ah ah ah)
Ça m'énerve moi même quand je cause (ah ah ah ah ah)
Mais j'ai l'impression que ça va mal (ah ah ah ah ah)
Même si je peux pas faire grand chose (ah ah ah ah ah)

Tu voudrais changer, te ranger
Difficile d'affronter la vérité
Tes mauvaise habitudes sont presque une fierté
Tes défauts sont devenu ta personnalité
Envie de tout foutre en l'air tu supportes plus la gravité
T'enfonce dans le mensonge tu commences à paniquer
Méfie-toi a qui tu demande du réconfort
Tu pourrais trouver de quoi t'apitoyer sur ton sort

(Ah ah ah ah ah)
J'ai l'impression de faire la morale (ah ah ah ah ah)
Ça m'énerve moi même quand je cause (ah ah ah ah ah)

Allo?
Ouais c'est Gringe ça va?
Ça va et toi?
Ouais ça va, Eyh dis moi j'ai écouté la chanson d'avant là, tu parles pas de moi?
Ahh euhh nan!
Ah bon?
Ça te dis qu'on fasse un morceau ensemble?
Okay",La  Morale
Orelsan,"Sa mère voulait attendre et la marier
Son père voulait la pendre ou la noyer
Un seul enfant par foyer
Il voulait un garçon
Mais sa connasse de femme a fait le taff qu'à moitié
A la campagne on a besoin d'hommes forts pour travailler
Pas d'une bouche à nourrir, pas d'une pisseuse bonne qu'à chialer
C'est presque impossible de vivre à trois
Une fille unique, c'est perdre son nom de famille
C'est la honte pour un villageois
Qu'est ce qu'il pouvait faire d'un déchet humain?
Lui éclater le crâne entre deux pierres, l'enterrer a côté du chien?
Il partit emprunter une pelle chez son voisin
Mais son voisin lui dit d'attendre
Il lui dit qu'il pourrait la vendre

Et la chance leur sourit
Un marchand leur proposa d'acheter l'enfant pour la vendre à des touristes
Ils l'ont lâché pour environ un tiers de SMIC français
Le soir de son départ, mélancolique, sa mère chantait

Douze ans plus tard la jeune fille dort tranquillement chez son hôte
Son réveil ? C'est un grand coup de pieds dans les côtes
Son petit dèj ? C'est du pain à la vapeur et de l'eau
Puis direction la salle des machines pour rejoindre les autres
Elle s'est jamais faite adopter par deux riches occidentaux
Son propriétaire l'a élevée, l'a gardée sous le manteau
Neuf dans le même endroit
Sa chambre? Une caisse en bois
A huit ans elle a décroché son premier emploi
Une sorte de garderie où on fabrique des shorts de foot
Avec ses mains en formes de pieds à force de coudre
Avec sa colonne vertébrale en forme de voûte
Vingt minutes de pause déjeuner, un peu de riz, un bol de soupe
Interdiction de parler, à peine le droit de faire des gestes
Elle doit garder la tête baissée pour s'adresser à ses chefs
Le bruit la hante au point qu'elle entend plus quand il s'arrête
Pour pas sombrer dans la folie elle chante cette chanson dans sa tête

De retour dans son village natal après dix années
En quête d'un cocon familial, à la recherche de son passé
Finalement, son maître lui apprit qui elle était vraiment
Juste avant qu'il aille finir sa vie dans les geôles du gouvernement
Son usine s’étant faite démanteler discrètement
La presse n'étant pas autorisée à couvrir l’événement
Bref, la plupart des gens du village avaient levé le camp
Partis loin, ouvrir des restaurants ou divers magasins de vêtements
Pour les rejoindre elle traversa des océans
Frôla la mort, laissant son destin voguer au gré des vents
Sans personne, sans argent, sans carte d'identité
De toute façon elle avait pas de nom, à part «La mendiante bridée»
Après avoir contracté presque toutes les maladies
Elle atterrit miraculeusement à Paris
Je rentrais chez moi après le travail, à la tombée de la nuit
Quand nos regards se sont croisés, elle s'est approchée et m'a dit
«Hum, excusez moi Monsieur, Porte-clefs, Deux euros?
Euh non, désolé, j'ai rien sur moi, bonne soirée!»",La  Petite Marchande de Porte-Clefs
Orelsan,"Alors
Plus j'avance, plus je gr
Ah je l'ai déjà, je me répète

Y a deux ans je comprenais pas grand chose
Maintenant c'est pire
Depuis quand pour devenir populaire faut faire des trucs de geek
Ils posteraient des sextapes de leurs parents pour plus de clics
Personne trouve de travail fixe même avec un bac +8
Mon livreur de pizza sait réparer des satellites
La mode c'est des cols en V, des pulls, des chemises et des gilets
Les professeurs, les banquiers, les comptables sont devenus stylés
On raconte nos vies à des étrangers pour se sentir exister
Je viens de voir une vieille faire une crise cardiaque (premier réflexe)
Je l'ai tweeté!
Ça me choquerait pas que les insultes dans nos pensées soient bippées
Profilé, à ta sonnerie je connais ta personnalité
Autour de moi la cocaïne parait tellement cliché
Ça me choquerait pas si j'apprenais que mes grands-parents sniffaient

Plus j'avance et plus j'avance et plus j'avance et plus je suis blasé

Des gens normaux y en a pleins dehors mais je les regarde à la télé
Tu peux être une célébrité et travailler chez ED l'épicier
Plus l'émission m'abrutis plus j'ai envie de la regarder
Ça me poserait pas de problèmes que Direct8 remplace Arté
Les petits vont en cours Guccisés, Louis Vuitonnisés
Bientôt y'aura des carrés VIP dans les lycées
Nos scoots étaient débridés maintenant c'est leur sexualité
Ça me choquerait pas si Marc Dorcel rachetait Walt Disney
Les mères se font lifter, les filles se font plastifier
Bientôt les gamines de huit piges feront du 90B
Ça me choquerait pas de trouver du lubrifiant dans les Kinder
J'ai comme envie de gifler tous ces clones de Justin Bieber

Elles touchent des bourses pour se payer leurs études
Mais pas celles de l’État
Ils mettraient des caravanes à la fac ça me choquerait pas
Fermez les bibliothèques on a des PS3
Y a des caméras partout vos 15 minutes de gloire m'intéressent pas
Tu connais les pas t’espère que la tecktonik revienne
Tu portes encore des Wayfarer c'est plus la mode depuis deux semaines
On sème la terreur dans le crâne des électeurs
Ça me choquerait pas que Wes Craven fasse le journal de 13 heure
J'ai peur les capacités de mon cerveau diminuent
Docteur ma planète est déréglée comme un oubli de pilule
Je pourrais croiser Michael au prochain coin de rue
Plus rien ne m'étonne j'suis plus assez naïf pour avoir un point de vue

Je porte un toast à la mort de l'industrie
Sortez les huit six on viens fêter la fin du disque
Écouter la radio c'est devenu un supplice
Sauf que j'aime pas non plus les putains de puristes
Musique rétro futuriste, la bande originale des aventures d'Ulysse
J'habiterais dans les abysses, j'aurais pas plus de pression
Tout ce que je veux, foutre le feu dans ma ville, Néron

Donner mon corps à la science inclus la dissection
Des jours entiers je récite mes leçons
Tourmentés dans une pute qu'est sous rer
Qu'en un an ça m'a saoulé je voulais tout plaqué, quitté le son
J'ai presque abandonné sans faire ma deuxième livraison
Mais bordel j'ai fais le plus dur
Autant tenter un salto avant d'échouer au pied du mur
Je suis de retour avec ma sous-culture
Ouais, sauf que c'est nous le futur, hein, (c'est nous le futur)
Je viens retourner l'opinel entre les points de suture
Ils sont la censure, plus tard on aura l'usure
Plus tard on ira danser sur leur sépulture
Le chant des succubes, au bord de la luxure
Sans concessions les sentiments sont plus pures
Voilà pourquoi j'écris des chansons de rupture
J'essaye de prendre du recul, j'essaye d'avancer
Les gens murmurent j'ai du mal à m'entendre penser
Fils d'extraterrestre, étoile céleste
Je viens féconder une femelle de chaque espèces
J'apprends à contrôler mes sales réflexes, je me fais jouir avant d'écrire
J'en ai marre de parler de sexe
Je sais que ta petite copine n'aime pas mes textes
Mais si j'écoutais toutes les juments je ferais du rap équestre
Ça m'énerve pas je respecte
Je fais comme Rocky dans la réserve, je m'en bas les steaks
J'aimerais faire parti des optimistes
J'aime rapporter une sorte de message positif
Comme l’héroïne dans un test d'urine, comme le dépistage de Freddy Mercury
Je reviens faire du bruit, j'ai le son qui frappe
Skread m'a ordonné d'enfoncer le clou comme Ponce Pilate
Comme Ablaye et Gringe font les bacs on est quatre
Les chevaliers de l'apocalypse on débarque
En an de grâce MJ+1, la moitié de ma jeunesse est morte le vingt-cinq juin
Je continue de faire du chemin pour devenir moi même
Dans l'amour, dans la haine, dans la moyenne
Je resterais pas bloqué dans une parodie de succès
Dans une version d'entourage à petit budgets
Je ferais que ce qui me plaît jusqu'à ma dernière quête
Jusqu’à retourner dans l’hôtel Ri plié des serviette
La peur n'existe plus dans mon dojo, eh eh, j'ai retiré mon Mojo (baby)
Dites à la ménagère qu'on a ressuscité CloClo
Dites aux connards d'intermittents d'allumer les projos
Appelez les pogos, on va déterrer la hache de guerre
Ramener la concurrence à l'age de pierre
Si t'as la fureur de vaincre moi j'ai la rage de perdre
Je prends même plus la peine de répondre à vos clashs de merde
Je prêterais ni mon beuz, ni mon temps
(Ni mon temps) Je verserais ni ma sueur, ni mon sang
(Ni mon sang) Tu parles de moi pour rien dans tes titres
Tu ferais même pas de buzz avec un album antisémite
Merci quand même pour le coup de pub (merci)
Merci les chiennes de garde pour le coup de pute (merci)
Merci à tout ceux qui m'ont soutenus
J'oublie trop souvent de remercier les gens qui m'ont soutenu
Faut qu'on s'offre une nouvelle vie, faut qu'on s'ouvre l'esprit
Faut que les pantins coupe les fils
Prend la route et fuis, j'ai une soucoupe en double file
Je te ramène avec oim, RaelSAn",Raelsan
Orelsan,"J’attends, pas grand-chose de spécial
Les jours passent et se ressemblent un peu
Tout le temps, la tête dans les étoiles
Des tonnes de personnes défilent sous mes yeux
Pourtant je me sens si seul, hey, hey, hey, hey
Pourtant je me sens si seul, nanana, na nanana
Pourtant je me sens si seul, hey, hey, hey, hey
Pourtant je me sens si seul, nanana, na nanana

Des fois je me sens vraiment bien des fois c’est du bluff
Des fois je fais des blocages, j’parle pas de faire du smurf
Rien de neuf, à part un coup de vieux dans les rues de ma ville
Je dors plus la nuit, je dialogue avec une machine
Je sors de chez moi sous les insultes de ma voisine
Elle a pas de voiture mais sa vie c’est surveiller sa place de parking
Quand je pense qu’elle a traversé le temps pour ça je ressens tellement de pitié
Vieillir me fait vraiment flipper
Quand je grandissais je remplissais des trous avec du vide
Je peux pas devenir le plus intelligent je serai le plus stupide!
Je portais l’adolescence comme un fardeau
Passe-moi une craie blanche je veux plus noircir le tableau
Passe-moi des explosifs une masse ou un marteau
J’en ai marre d’escalader la pyramide de Maslow
Je transpire à grosses goûtes chaque fois que le jour se lève
Je passe mes nuit à courir après mes rêves

J’attends, pas grand-chose de spécial

Y a toujours un papier qui manque

Ça tombe bien j’ai pris le 60!
Les jaloux croient que je suis blindé, c’est pas l’avis de ma banque
Te façon j’habite à Caen, j’entends que la pluie battante
Les Trésors Publics doit être rempli d’amiante
J’ai mal au crâne quand on me demande de remplir mes fiches à temps
Je prends le volant après 15 vodkas je conduis bizarrement
Je parle de Super Mario Kart sur Wii, évidement!
En ce moment je vois moins mes potes qu’à l’époque
Je commence à saturer de raconter les mêmes anecdotes
J’essaye le plus possible de voir mes grands-parents
Je me sens tellement feignant quand j’écoute leurs histoires du temps d’avant
Souvent absent, j’ai la tête ailleurs
Je m’entends parler sans convictions comme si je me voyais de l’extérieur
Toujours 60 minutes de retard au compteur
Tous les soirs je m’égare dans la 25ème heure

J’attends, pas grand-chose de spécial
