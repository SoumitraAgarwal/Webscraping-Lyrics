You were in my arms 
And in a special way 
You touched my heart with all your charms. 
Now you're gone 
And I find myself 
Baby, I'm all alone

And I did all I know 
To win your love and make it so 
You'd always stay 
But you turned away. 
Honey, what could I say? 
How could you 
How could you do me this way? 

Cuz I'm chained 
To your love and affection.

Is my only direction

The Sweet Inspirations,"I'll never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurting me
I've got my pride and I know how to hide
All the sorrow and pain
I'll do my crying in the rain

If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you
So though the heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain

Raindrops falling from heaven
Will never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I'll wait for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

Someday when my crying's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool
But till then, darling, you'll never see me complain

They play rock and roll music like it hasn't been rocked for years

Well she's sexy and seventeen .....

Well-a-hell-a-hell-a when I feel that rockin' beat
I can't sit still ; up , out of my seat come on
Babe lets shuffle 'round your feet
Can't learn nothin' in school they don't teach you on the street !

Wo-oh , wo-oh , baby I like your style
Wo-oh oh oh oh baby I like your style
You don't care what the other kids say , You go real wild

Well you're sexy and seventeen
My little rock-roll queen
Acts a little bit obscene
Gotta let off a little steam
Dig that sound and shake it around your mind , mind , mind
Dig that sound and shake it around your mind , mind , mind

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
The Swing Set,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine

And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

Think I'm gonna have a son.
He will be like she and me, free as a dove,
Conceived in love.
The sun is gonna shine above.

And even though we ain't got money,
I'm so in love with you honey,
And everything will bring a chain of love.
And in the morning, when I rise,
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright.

Seems as though, a month ago, I was Beta-Chi,
Never got high.
And oh I was a sorry guy.
And now I smile and face a girl that shares my name.
Now I'm through with the game.
This boy will never be the same.

And even though we ain't got money,
I'm so in love with you honey,
And everything will bring a chain of love.
And in the morning, when I rise,
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything, is gonna be alright.

Love a girl who holds the world in a paper cup.
And drink it up.
Love her and she'll bring you luck.
And if you find she helps your mind, buddy take her home.
Oh don't you live alone.
Try to earn what lovers own.

And even though we ain't got money,
I'm so in love with you honey,
And everything will bring a chain of love.
And in the morning, when I rise,
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright.

Even though we ain't got money,
I'm so in love with you, honey,
And everything will bring a chain of love.
And in the morning, when I rise,
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright.",Danny's Song
The Swon Brothers,"Look at us baby, up all night
Tearing our love apart
Aren't we the same two people
Who live through years in the dark?
Oh oh
Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay

When we get crazy,
It just ain't right,
Girl, I get lonely, too
You don't have to worry
Just hold on tight (Don't get caught in your little world)
'Cause I love you
Nothing's wrong as far as I can see (I can see)
We make it harder than it has to be

The Sword,"It was a relic of another time
Plundered from an ancient tomb
Wrought by forgotten arts
Inscribed with cryptic runes

They called us fierce marauders
Warp riders and guns for hire
Before the sky cried tears of fire

Looking out across the void
We beheld a fearsome sight
Two armadas arrayed before us
Preparing to unleash their might

The Lady kept her promise
We heard the sound of a cosmic choir
The night the sky cried tears of fire

This is the hour of the Phoenix
When all must be reborn in flame
And though they did not know it
Nothing could remain the same

Aw we drift through a sea of pyres
The stars will always remember
When the sky cried tears of fire",(The Night the Sky Cried) Tears of Fire

So I headed down to the corner store

There were people dancin' in the stret
Moving to the funky beat just groovin'
They were dancin' to the rhythm of the back beat
So I lost my head and followed the crowd
To a doorway where the music was loud

Said all you other D.J's just don't know how to do it like Mr. Nice
I'm like Kentucky fried chicken, I di it right
There were people dancin' in the street
Movin' to a funky beat just groovin'
They were dancin' the rhythm of the back beat
Well, I lost my head started to shout
In my p.j I was turnin' it out
And no one stopped to stare
Cause it doesn't even matter what clothes you're wearin'

Hey, this is the house of rhythm, welcome everybody
Hey this is the house of rhythm, we like to party
Live tonight
The house will rock
Live tonight

Nighttime lover, over and over
I dream of us dancin' in the dark, me and my
Nighttime lover, love undercover

It knew from the start
This tenderness would cause a fire

Shirk a-like a losing dog.
If just tonight that I could be where you are near
And just forget where I am lost.

And the dirtiest sweater he owns.

And that's why
You're so beautiful now

And, dancin' your bike to the lonesome, young mare
You call up her owner; say your heart will be there
You'll build a collection of scars on your knees
To learn how to count the impossible trees
You grew up by climbin' the birches so high
And that's why
You're so beautiful now

Where I was lost but left to trace
By carving riddles on the lonesome vine.

Oh but rumor has it that I wasn't born,
I just walked in one frosty morn.
Into the vision of some vacant mind.

Oh once I held a pony by its flying mane,
And once I called the shadow in the turning game
But I will fight this stranger that you should fear
So I won't be a burden of tomorrow dear

Aw Xavier's on the border of the sun
Swings on the chambers of your guns.
And tries to shoot the chord and light the path.

Aw but hell I'm just a blind man on the plains,
I drink my water when it rains,
And live by chance among the lightning strikes.

Oh once I held a glacier to an open flame
And once I felt like wildcat in the fallen game.
But I will fight this stranger that you should fear
So I won't be a burden of tomorrow dear.

Oh the singers on the edge to feed the canyons mouth
They will go on forever til they sing you out of time.
But I will fight this stranger that you should fear
So I won't be a burden of tomorrow dear.",Burden of Tomorrow

There is love, there is rest

From all these riots of broken sounds
Where you sleep on the track
Every night, oh no

And we don't know if your treasure is safe
Or where you'll be when they find you some
And you know you're always following me

I'll be the best when the silence comes",Wind and Walls

You to get with Mr. Swift or Rift,

Kinda like shaft, so you can say I'm shafting

The Tarriers,"Oh come all you young fellers so young and so fine
Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul
Till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal
Where it's dark as a dungeon damp as the dew danger is double pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day
(uh huh no laughin' during this song please it's bein' recorded)
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home 
And pity the miner digging my bones

The TCM Group,"On the first part of the journey 
I was looking at all the life 
There were plants and birds and rocks and things 
There was sand and hills and rings 
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz 
And the sky with no clouds 
The heat was hot and the ground was dry 
But the air was full of sound 

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name 
It felt good to be out of the rain 
In the desert you can remember your name 
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain 
La, la

After two days in the desert sun 
My skin began to turn red 
After three days in the desert fun 
I was looking at a river bed 
And the story it told of a river that flowed 
Made me sad to think it was dead 

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name 
It felt good to be out of the rain 
In the desert you can remember your name 
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain 
La, la 

After nine days I let the horse run free 
'Cause the desert had turned to sea 
There were plants and birds and rocks and things 
there was sand and hills and rings 
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground 
And a perfect disguise above 
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground 
But the humans will give no love 

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name

In the desert you can remember your name

I figure it's about the happiest sound goin' down today.

I dig the Mamas and the Papas at ""The Trip,""
Sunset Strip in L.A.
And they got a good thing goin'
When the words don't get in the way.
And when they're really wailing,
Michelle and Cass are sailin'.
Hey! they really nail me to the wall.

I dig Donovan in a dream-like, tripped out way
His crystal images tell you 'bout a brighter day
And when the Beatles tell you
They've got a word ""love"" to sell you
They mean exactly what they say

I lit my way with a scream

I turned around and touched it from a distance
And then it fell to the ground

Loud cry from the shallows 
Lust feeds on the fear
Walls crack under pressure
I think the end is getting near

And in my mind was the fury of a madness
That consecrated the dirt
I stumbled through the enigma of the reason
And celebrated the hurt
And then I found through an act of desperation
A subtle rip in the heart
I was seduced by the fear of devastation
And then it tore me apart

Oh no, nothing matters
When it takes me
When it rapes me, breaks me
Shakes me down

A quick escape from the edge of commination
I slept the night with my spleen
A vain excuse, I was searching for some answers
I broke away from the scene

Loaded guns attract. We know the rules, we don't react. We wait in hope, we don't expect - You and me and rainbows.
Down here everything is fine. We have a straw, we have a line. We have a bag, a rock, a mountain with a string of shepherds driving lions. Aiming skewers at the sheep... face down, asleep in onion fields. The frying fields. The worms... they peep through holes which once were eyes. They thrive... they bake although we painted out the sky and the sun. There's only thunder, and you and me and raindows.
Let's hide out in the lay-by, let the time fly by. Tonight's disguise - a car crash with our wheels like shattered stars, our dashboard charred. Our windscreen... a graveyard for the flies (we're fast!) The hungry flies are circling, mourning as the watchers squat with cameras, cakes and flasks. They're spying, spitting as the blue light flashes, axes swing. We're broken wings, but still we'll fly and we'll reach our destination - you and me and rainbows.
And if we turn the lights down low and watch the sky cry through the window... Will I watch your fingers grow and stretch like butterflies? The shadows flexing, licking toes, and blinding as slowly sun sets on the same old hill. The same red glow. We're quite alone - just you and me and rainbows.
Everything I own is in the corner of your room. It's covered with a sheet just like it died - but I will take a broom. I'll sweep it new again, arrange it... Oh, I'll grow a dozen hands. No I never will neglect my world again. I'm safe beneath my blanket. Call it home... For you. For me... and rainbows

Cried ""meltdown zero marsh of lava""

And barriers of you and me piled 1500 high

We blackened out the sky

They kicked away the board
Flew headfirst into bunkers
Then they started out once more
And you and me were born again
As iron-plated pawns
We scorched our way through libraries
We shredded all the lawns
Til everything was rust and powder
Every stone was turned
And random programs re-arranged the areas to burn

He's tapped into the phone
He hides beneath the furniture
Knows all the special codes

He spits a line I spastic dive
And sell him his reward

I can still remember you with coronets, white horses
I would run behind you'd flash a sign I'd dive

You tried to kiss my tears away, pretend there was no day to take me down

On day 2 I fucked her and it was wild
She is such a slut

Basically as I was stepping out of my s.u.v.
I came face to face with my step cousin or whatever
Who cares
Anyway he was wearing skinny jeans had funky hair
And the cutest british accent ever

With his sexy attitude and the way he looked at me
Mmm he is totally awesome

Here come the stars, baby, tumbling around me
There's the sky, where the sea should be

What now my love, now that you're gone

I know that no one would care, baby, no one would cry
If I should live or die, no one would care, if I should live or die, oh, oh

To my thoughts for five to ten years and to writing them down
War has caused unrest among the younger generation

Wars come and go what remains are only the values of culture

Then of course there is revolutionary love
Love of comrades fighting for the people and love of people
Not an abstract people but people one meets and works with
When Che Guevara taught of love being
At the center of revolutionary endeavor, he meant both

For people like Che or George Jackson or Malcolm X
Love was the prime mover of their struggle
That love cost them their lives, love coupled with a man's pride

About little boys running away from home

Know your broken wing has mended and your need for me has ended

You were lost in yesterday I gave you my tomorrow
Know your leaving me in sorrow and you telling me: ""im sorry"" but baby

The Temptations,"When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick tick tock of the eye of the clock
As it's standing against the wall
Like the drip drip drip of the rain drops
When the summer shower's through
So a voice within me
Keeps revealing you...you

Night and day
You are the one
Only you beneath the moon
And under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, baby, where you are
I think of you
Night and day

Day and night
Why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic gloom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you
Night and day

Night and day
Under the hide of me
Though such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
This torment won't be through
'Til you let me spend my life making love to you

The Temptations,"Some enchanted evening
You may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger
Across a crowded room
And somehow you know,
You know even then
That somewhere you'll see her
Again and again.

Some enchanted evening
Someone may be laughin',
You may hear her laughin'
Across a crowded room
And night after night,
As strange as it seems
The sound of her laughter
Will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it?
Who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons,
Wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening
When you find your true love,
When you feel her call you
Across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side,
And make her your own
For all through your life you
May dream all alone.

Once you have found her,
Never let her go.
Once you have found her,
Never let her go!",Some Enchanted Evening

I tell you it was just my imagination
running away with me...

""Dear Lord, hear my plea...
don't ever let another take her love from me 
or I will surely die..""
Ooh, her love is heavenly;
when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody...
but in reality, she doesn't even know me

The Temptations Review,"Childhood part of my life, it wasn't very pretty.
You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city,
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children besides me.
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep.
It was hard times,
Needed something to ease my troubled mind.
Listen!  my father didn't know the meaning of work,
He disrespected mama, and treated us like dirt.
I left home, seekin' a job that I never did find,
Depressed and downhearted I took to cloud nine,
I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Listen one more time I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Folks down there tell me,
They say, ""give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by"".
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive,
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.
Listen!  it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night,
I'm doin' fine, on cloud nine.
Let me tell you about cloud nine.

Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be
(cloud nine) you ain't got no responsibility,
And ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free
(cloud nine)  and you're a million miles from reality.
I wanna say I love the life I live,
And I'm gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine.
I'm riding high
On cloud nine, you're as free as a bird in flight
(cloud nine)  there's no diff'rence between day and night
(cloud nine)  it's a world of love and harmony
(cloud nine)  you're a million miles from reality.

Runnin' away with me.
It was just my imagination runnin' away with me

This couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems;
But it was just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.

Every night on my knees I pray, Dear Lord, Hear my plea;
Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody, but in reality she doesn't even know me.

The girl has found another and gone away.
With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room.
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain,

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears,
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,
Let it rain, let it rain.

Along a quiet road that wanders by

The tallest tress, 
I'm part of it all.
I have stumbled through the night 
Alone as anyone can be,
Then found a silent valley full of stars 
And in my heart I heard them telling me 
I was home.
I've seen the rugged mountain tops 
And golden pastures on my way,
Now everywhere I go across the lands, 
I stand so proudly in the sun and say,
I am home
The gentle winds, the rains that fall,
The tallest tress, I'm part of it all.

And grace will lead me home.

Just listen to the moon's serenade, he's calling out your name

That lie lifeless and unfilled beneath the soil.
I see an old man fingering his perishing flesh.
He tells himself he was a good man and did good things.
Amused and confused by life's little ironies,
He swallows his bottle of distilled damnation.
People turn around with unseeing eyes.
They're looking for something that doesn't exist.
The world you once knew is being eaten up by rust.
No-one has time for the past, but still, in God they trust.
The future is now, but it's all going wrong.
Bodies good for nothing, but it's to nothing they belong.

If you give them all your money, they'll give you their hearts.
This town ain't going like a ghost town.
It's going like hell....

Where could she have got to.

You roll on your side -
& run your fingers through your hair -
Your scared of losing her -
& facing yourself -

But your cutting chunks from your heart.
& rubbing the meat into your eyes.

Your relying on her - for your independence
She can't leave you here - alone & defenseless

Surrounded by his symbols of prosperity--
Sits back in his new leather chair
Ripped off the back of some unfortunate beast.
I'm smiling through my teeth.
Anybody can be a millionaire,
So everybody's gotta try
But by the laws of this human jungle
Only the heartless will survive.
& down there--but for the grace of god
--go I.

The smoke & the steam, & the broken down dreams,
The hope, & the hunger, frustration & anger,
The little drunken lives,--
Driven' through the traffic lights
& away from who they are!

But I've been thinking of you--
In this great city of great solitude.

Crossin' the central reservation, of my imagination,
Searchin' for the world I...left behind.
A shadow hunting shadows of childhood life.
It's all I want--& all I miss--
But how can I return, to a place that don't exist!!

from Mombosa to Miami, Beiruit to Bangladesh,
I've flown around the world standing
On the wing of a jet.
Tryin' to salvage my emotions
From the bottom of the oceans--

why'see I sold my soul, to pay for my dinner.
My stomach grew fatter, but my heart grew thinner,
I ain't foolin' I'm fallin', I wasn't wicked, just weak,
I ain't lyin' I'm dyin', crippled by deceit--

Oh the hand that wrote the agony
Has just begun--
Will be the hand that pulls the trigger
--of this gun!!!









",Twilight of a Champion
The The,"Suddenly last summer
I started going out of my head
In a tiny hotel room 
Lying naked on a bed
I knew what you were doing
And I knew what you'd done
Your life with me was ending 
Your new life had begun
But I was cursing your name
And I was cursing that room
And I was praying for the strength
To stop loving you

I started writing you the letter
Which turned into the book
I was gonna reach across the ocean
And force you to look
What kind of man was I?
Who would sacrifice your happiness to satisfy his pride?
What kind of man was I?
Who would delay your destiny to appease his tiny mind?

Then you came back to me
And I went down on one knee
With a glint in my eyes
And a rose between my teeth
And I pushed out my tongue
For you to see
That I'd been dying of a thirst
For your company
And then you quenched my loneliness
With your tears
And our clothes fell away
As we rolled back the years
But we couldn't deny it
Because we could not admit it
If our love was too strong to die
Or we were just too weak to kill it
Was our love too strong to die?
Or were we just to weak to kill it?

Every moment in that room
I closed my eyes in prayer
Every moment I awoke
I clenched my teeth in prayer

What kind of man was I?
Who would sacrifice your happiness to satisfy his pride?
What kind of man was I?
Who would delay your destiny to appease his tiny mind?
What kind of man was I?
Who could delay your destiny to appease his aching, swollen pride?
Who could delay your destiny to appease his screaming little mind?

Let the bums count their blessings while they count the money

The The,"Peeling the skin back from my eyes I felt surprised
That the time on the clock was the time I usually retired
To the place where I cleared my head of you
But just for today I think I lie here and dream of you

I've got you under my skin where the rain can't get in
But if the sweat pours out, just shout
I'll try to swim and pull you out

A howling wind that blows the litter as the rain flows
As street lamps pour orange colored shapes, through your windows
A broken soul stares from a pair of watering eyes
Uncertain emotions force an uncertain smile

I've got you under my skin where the rain can't get in
But if the sweat pours out, just shout
I'll try to swim and pull you out

Turned around maybe one day
You were all that was there

Blue, why don't you stay behind?
So blue, why don't you stop?
Look at what's goin' down

She'd never sell me a lie
It's hard to sing with someone
Who won't sing with you

Give all of my mercy, give all of my heart
Never thought I'd miss you
That I'd miss you so much
You brought me through

The Thorns,"Runaway Feeling Lyrics
Is a runaway feelin' about as big as the sky?
You know the rock and roll feelin'
Really makes you feel high

Tell me I'm the one you wanna play with
Tell me I'm the one you really need
Tell me I'm the one you're bound to stay with
When you're free to do what you please

It's a runaway feelin' once you make up your mind 
(what you're feeling) (make up your mind)
To let the runaway feelin' leave all your troubles behind 
(that you're feeling) (leave them behind)

Tell me I'm the one you wanna play with 
Tell me I'm the one you really need
Tell me I'm the one you're bound to stay with 
When you're free to do what you please

And you're free (run run, run away run run run run away)
Do what you please (run run, run away run run run run away)
Rollin' and a reelin' no way of slowin' it down 
I'll take this runaway feelin'

And ride it out of this town
Tell me I'm the one you wanna play with 
Tell me I'm the one you really need
Tell me I'm the one you're bound to stay with 

When you're free to do what you please
And you're free (run run, run away run run run run away)
Do what you please (run run, run away run run run run away)
Do what you please (run run run run away run run run run away)",Runaway Feeling
The Thorns,"She sleeps alone without her clothes on 
While I dream of how things could have been 
She doesn't want me and I don't know why 
I left a message in the midnight sky
But now I know she'll never find it

Maybe I'll see tomorrow
But for tonight I know I'm blind
Such a shame (to want you)
When you can't (belong to) 
Someone else
Such a shame 

You may be wrong and I'm not crazy 
Though I admit that I'm confused
I waited patiently you walked on by 
I had to have you now I want to die 
So there's no way to justify it

Maybe I'll see tomorrow
But for tonight I know I'm blind
Such a shame (to want you) 
When you can't (belong to)
Someone else
Such a shame

The Thorns,"Think It Over Lyrics
Reach inside yourself
Find what is left
Things go wrong

But you're still strong
Time heals almost everything
And the world outside
Doesn't need to let you in

Lay your own stepping stones
Think It over
Might not be today
You'll know what to do
When it all turns around
Think it over
Might not see the way
Right in front of you

But it all comes around
Back against the wall (many ways to fall down)
There are many ways to fall (you might change your mind)
Take your time

Change your mind (take your time)
Chorus
Solo
Take your time
Change your mind (take your time)
Think it over
Might not be today
You'll know what to do
When it all turns around

Might not see the way
Right in front of you
But it all
Yes it all
Comes around

You're out of my heart

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye

The setting for nights beyond forgetting

It was the most convenient door
I found a million dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store.
The rain continued for an hour.
I hung around for three or four.
Around a million dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store.

She was selling china
And when she made those eyes,
I kept buying china

If you should run into a shower,
Just step inside my cottage door,
And meet the million-dollar baby

Spring or fall.

In a very unexpected place.

The Three Suns,"There never was a gal I could love, like I love my Josephine
She's a flirt, she's a scamp, she's the vampiest vamp I've ever seen
It seems to me she's always flirting with the fellows passing by
But when I say she winks, then she tells me she thinks
There's a cinder in her eye
I believe it would be better if I'd leave her and forget
Everybody says it would be wise
But each time that I go out to dance with somebody else
I find myself dancing with tears in my eyes
For there's nobody quite so nice who can be quite so mean 
As my gal, what a gal, Josephine

With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by

And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,

How was she to know that every lovely vow
Was part of the game he was playing,
But to his surprise he realized
Somehow he meant every word he was saying.

When Blondie tells you what you want to hear, don't waste your time. 

[Chorus:] 
And her name is Blondie, sexy socialite. - Dumb blonde. 
Diggin' out on the town any given night. 
And her name is Blondie, the queen of glamorous. 
And the game is money, the girl is dangerous. 

Blondie was a victim to everything she liked. 
She likes money, fine clothes and fancy cars, but her name she could not write. 
Blondie is a certain type, she's not yellow, black or white. 
But you can find her out diggin' in the finer spots on any given night. 

Her fatal beauty's blinding and her intentions not kind. 
She tried to take a part of me, but I caught on in time. 
She lives a life of make believe, takes what she wants and leaves. 
Blondes, they do have more fun, but how dumb is she? 

[Chorus]

Blondie, my glamorous superstar. You took it much too far. 
And now you look like ""What happened?"" 
Blondie, a dangerous socialite 
She hangs out every night 
And the neighborhood game is to dog you blind 

Yeah! 
Blondie! 
Blondie is a dumb blonde 
Hey Blondie, ooh ooh 

(Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Yeah! 
Everything is right 
She's the queen of glamorous 
Whoo! 

She's the queen of glamorous, everything is right 
All the fellas have a fit anytime she walks by 
This woman would be dangerous if she had a mind 
When Blondie tells you what you want to hear, if you're smart, you won't waste your time

And they are the reason that I am here tonight.
You know a lot of groups split up. It happens all the time.
I think there should be a law against it.

We've been talkin' about the reunion for a year now. It has finally happened.
And what better place for it to happen than right here in Minneapolis.
Give it up, my brothers: THE TIME!

The Time,"I got real bored on a Friday night, I couldn't find a damn thing to do.
So I pulled out a suit about the same color as my BMW.
I drove to the party and I pimped on in, just to see what I could see.
Everybody knew what I was lookin' for, I was lookin' for some company.

I saw a real fine thing sittin' by the bar. She looked kinda all alone.
So I pimped on over and I asked her name. The child was bad to the bone.
I showed her my stash and I kissed her cheek. The only kind of rap it takes.
She knew I was bad when I pulled out a leash, she said ""How much money you make?""

Jerk it, jerk it. Talkin' 'bout the jerk out.
Jerk it, jerk it. Talkin' 'bout the jerk out.

I took her to my crib and I tied her up. I figured that's what she liked.
Maybe I was wrong but what the hell, it didn't matter to me. She was white.
I said ""How come people in your neighborhood, don't like it when a brother's rich?
Ain't my blood the same color as yours? Answer that question, bitch!""

It just pisses you off to see me drivin' that fancy car, don't it?
Bet you'd rather see me drivin' one of those ester grate ones.
Like the one your daddy drives, wouldn't you?
Let me tell you one thing. That's dead!
About as dead as you'll be if you don't rearrange your brain.
Catch my drift. Turn it up!

Oh, nasty me!

Girl, you think you want to turn it up? Where's my checkbook?
That's right, check it out. An awful lot of O's, wouldn't you say?

Send all the weak, can't get to prison
I wanna write about setting something free

And this is all about starting out again
Same, or same, or never same

So friends won't buy, won't get a job

Make all the changes that you need to make

The Ting Tings,"It's honest, I'm ticking those boxes
Make out like Speedy Gonzales
Finito, a liar
Iya iya think I'm on fire
Flawless, look at your faces
Two sides don't make me hate this
I'm on it, I call it, liar liar your words expire

You can hit me down Sonny
But Sonny only got so much for me
You can hit me down Sonny
But Sonny can't help me no more
Hey now, hey now now, Sonny won't get me down
He ain't got my soul he ain't got my anything now now

Wall paint, crawling on elbows
I make you a little no-show
On tip-toes, behind, spin around around around and I'll find ya'
Forecast, this is a heatwave
I'll make you a banging headache
Controlling, so lonely
Liar liar jump in the fire

And you can hit me down Sonny
But Sonny only got so much for me
You can hit me down Sonny
But Sonny can't help me no more

The Ting Tings,"This could have been my destiny
I've hit the wall arrestlessly
Discovered though was part of me
I let you make a fool of me

Now in your life, you had my love
And in your life, you wasted time

Now I should leave without a noise

Or fall in love with other boys
I'll just make my sorry sound
Following myself around

Now in your life, you had my love
In my life, you wasted time

You love everybody else
Everybody else
Wish I was everybody else",In Your Life
The Ting Tings,"They said we needed patience
Well, it's been a long time
People get alone
When it goes off

We should never listen
Not necessary at all
We stand alone
And though serious
We should be having them

One by one
We should be having them
One by one

They will always come in
It's just a matter of time
We are not fools
They are not kind
Even in these new days
When the damage is done
There's a time and a place
Where you can get strong
We should be having them

One by one
We should be having them
One by one
We should be having them
One by one
We should be having them

Tried tried tried
To make you see
Tried tried tried
To make you believe in me
Tried tried tried
To make you see
Tried tried tried
To believe in me

We should be having them
One by one
We should be having them
One by one
We should be having them
One by one

That's what you need now

That's what you need now
That's what you should need

If you always have to wait
Well, in this morning we'll be gone
Is this what you really want?
You should never say never never ever, come on

If you never hold us down, they can never hold us down
If you're from a big city, I am from a little town
Then you never hold us down (shoot, shoot, shoot)

Strongly come straight down the meadow
Stand up, straight as a buddah
Hold this, act like a diamond
It's best even if falling that you live your personal history
All this can shine like a diamond

Hey, If you can’t move your feet
You wanna stand like a woman
You wanna stand with me
If you don’t seem to fit in
You wanna take some cover
You wanna leave with me

Did I ever tell you about the way I wanna feel
Giving it up and fly away
Did I ever tell you about the good times that you get
Don’t know if you got another day

Hey! I’m in the wrong club
Listening to this shit
(Oh oh oh oh)
Hey! I’m in the wrong life, someone get me out of it

And if you wanna come in
We can sit on boxes
I keep everything
Oh, and if you're standing in the corner
You can tell me you don’t wanna talk
And I tell you how it’s always been

Did I ever tell you about the way I wanna feel
Giving it up and fly away
And did I ever tell you about the good times that you get
Don’t know if you got another day

The Tiny,"Now I'm thinking maybe, I was stoned
I felt my feet lifted off the ground
And my heart was screaming
And my bones
I need you closer

As in the middle of the street
Then I pretend he is mine to keep
Cars are running fast on both sides
Of his head, his eyes say
Closer closer closer

I met him when the sun was down
The bar was closed
We both have had no sleep
My face beneath the street lamp
It reveals what it is lonely people seek
Closer closer closer

And I am close enough to lose
Close to the point, where you know that your mind, it can not choose
Close enough to lose
Close enough
To lose your heart",Closer

But then you leave me alone
See I don't want to be searching
Like some dog for a bone
You told me you love me
Yes you told me yourself

Right back on the shelf

Mona please won't you be my baby
Mona won't you be my baby tonight
Mona darling are you driving me crazy
Hold me close and darling won't you hold me tight

Fix your mouth before I carry you out
You better run fast from a man that drinks stout
Fix your mouth before I carry you out
