Curtis Stigers,"Lay your head on my shoulder
Feel my body keep you warm tonight
You're the child, I'm the cradle
Let me be your shelter 'til the morning light

And baby, won't you cry? Baby, cry
Let the tears from your eyes
And break these chains that have been
Keeping you prisoner all these years

Won't you just cry? Baby, cry
Let the tears from your eyes
Fall to the ground where they belong
With the other faded memories
Won't you just cry? Cry, cry

So you think it makes you stronger
Keeping everything you feel inside
But don't be foolish any longer
Let the mountains crumble, let the rain fall

And baby, won't you cry? Baby, cry
Let the tears from your eyes
And break these chains that have been
Keeping you prisoner all these years

Won't you just cry? Baby, cry
Let the tears from your eyes
Fall to the ground where they belong
With the other faded memories

Won't you just cry
And let the rain fall, let your heart grow?
Just let it go, won't you cry, cry, cry?
Let the rain fall, let your heart go

And baby, won't you cry? Baby, cry
Let the tears from your eyes
And break these chains that have been
Keeping you prisoner all these years

Won't you just cry? Baby, baby cry
Let the tears from your eyes
Fall to the ground where they belong
With the other faded memories

Won't you, won't you just cry? Baby cry
Cry, cry, cry",Cry
Curtis Stigers,"Never before have I seen you look so blue
Can't find the cure and nothing comforts you
The light at the end of the tunnel
Doesn't shine at the end of the day
Every time you cry
Save up all your tears, I will be your rainbow
When they disappear
Wash away the pain 'til you smile again
I will be the laughter in your eyes
Every time you cry
Every time you cry
Time has a way of wounding what has healed
What can I say, I know just how you feel
Your soul is dark and troubled
Like a river running wild
Every time you cry
Save up all your tears, I will be your rainbow
When they disappear
Wash away the pain 'til you smile again
I will be the one who dries your eyes
Every time you cry
Every time you cry
Well you know that's what I'm here for
And I will give you when you need more
There'll be no hesitation, I will reap no reward
",Everytime You Cry
Curtis Stigers,"What am I supposed to do with all these blues
No matter what I do
Watchin' the candle flicker out
In the evening glow
I can't let go
When will the night be over

I didn't mean to fall in love with you
And baby there's a name for what you put me through
It isn't love, it's robbery
I'm sleepin' with the ghost of you and me
The ghost of you and me

Seen a lot of broken hearts go sailin' by
Phantom ships lost at sea
And one of them is mine
Raising my glass, I sing a toast to the midnight sky
And I wonder why the stars don't seem to guide me

I didn't mean to fall in love with you
And baby there's a name for all the things you do
It isn't love, it's robbery
I'm sleeping with the ghost of you and me

The ghost of you and me
When will you set me free
I hear the voices call
Far away footsteps down the hall
Tryin' to save what's left of my heart and soul

Watchin' the candle flicker out
In the evening glow, I can't let go
When will the night be over

I didn't mean to fall in love with you
And baby there's a name for all the things you do
It isn't love, it's robbery
I'm sleepin' with the ghost of you and me
",Ghost of You and Me
Curtis Stigers,"You're sitting there cryin' at home
Waiting by the telephone
He's our runnin' around
Thinking that you'll never know
But you've played this game before
He breaks your heart again
You take him back and then it's over
Almost over
Except the loneliness
Of a long distance love
He looks for
Happiness
In the arms of another
Tell me
How many teardrops will fall
While you're waiting for that telephone call
That never comes
It never comes
You feel so alone
Especially when the night comes
So you go out
Hoping that you'll meet someone
To kill this pain inside
You let him take you home
And all the pain is gone away
But in the light of day
You see the
Loneliness
Of a long distance love
You look for tenderness
In the arms of another
Tell me
How many teardrops will fall
While he's waiting for tat telephone call
That never comes
It never comes
You still believe in the happy ever after
After the pain comes the love and the laughter
So you wait in vain and you wonder
Why it never comes
It never comes",It Never Comes
Curtis Stigers,"When the snows come
And the wind blows cold
Will you hold me
Like you'll never let go?
Will you kiss me so sweetly
And whisper you love me, so?

I have wandered through the mountains
I have searched the streets below
But all I ever really wanted
Was someone to hold me
And to keep me from the cold

And when the night falls
And you're fast asleep
I'll watch over you
And I'll pray your heart to keep
So you can sleep easy
You know you can count on me

I have wandered through the mountains
I have searched the streets below
But all I ever really wanted
Is someone to need me
And to keep me from the cold
Baby, keep me from the cold

Oh darlin' when you're sleeping
Am I with you in your dreams?
Do I hold you close
And dance you through the night?
And when the nightmares come
Will you let me be the one
Who kisses you
And tells you, ""It's alright""

And in the morning
When the light creeps in
I will hold you
As you're slowly waking
I'll kiss you so softly
And promise I'll never go

'Cause I have wandered through the mountains
I have searches the streets below
But all I ever really wanted
Is someone to need me
And to keep me from the cold

I have wandered through the mountains
I have searched the streets below
All I ever really wanted
Is for you to love me
I want you to love me
And keep me from the cold

Baby, keep me from the cold
All I ever wanted
So keep me from the cold
Keep me from the cold
Please keep me from the cold",Keep Me from the Cold
Curtis Stigers,"Well baby, let me come and take you out tonight
Where the music is a pumping and the lights are bright
When the whistle blows and the workday's done
We gonna get the party started and have some fun
I'll meet you after midnight, baby, don't be late
Down around the corner at the Empire State

The kids are getting down up in the Bronx tonight
Times Square is lit up like it's broad daylight
They're kickin' out the jams down in ol' Bay Ridge
The joint is really jumpin' on the Brooklyn Bridge
All the hippies boppin' down on Avenue A

Curtis Stigers,"It's after midnight, don't need no street light
'Cause here where I am there's always sunshine
Walk down the street now, can't find my feet now
I guess I'm acting like somebody in love

Just been with my girl, she changed my whole world
When I was lonely she come to hold me
She squeeze me so tight I'm feeling alright
I guess I'm acting like somebody in love
Yeah, I guess I'm acting like somebody in love

Somebody in love, somebody in love
Someone who just stares at the stars up above
Somebody in love, somebody in love
I guess I'm acting like somebody in love

I lost my suitcase, can't tie my boot lace
Forgot my game plan, I don't know where I am
I lost my house key, I lost it at sea
I guess I'm acting like somebody in love, yeah

Somebody in love, somebody in love
Someone who just stares at the stars up above
Somebody in love, somebody in love

",Somebody in Love
Curtis Stigers,"You got a dirty little secret
You got rocks in your head
You went looking for love pretty baby
Ended up in someone else's bed
You got the heat and the passion
You got the cash and the clothes
But you're still living a lie little girl

And you don't even want to know
Just keep your eyes closed and go home alone
You can't make love without heart and soul honey
There's more to makin' love than gettin' around
You can't make love outta sex and drugs and money
There's more to makin' love
There's more to makin' love
Than layin' down
Sounds like the perfect situation

Sounds like no strings attached
But who's gonna hold you when the party's over
And everybody wants their real lives back
Who's gonna be here to thrill you
When the beast goes back in the cage
Who's your Romeo and Juliet
When all the other actors want to leave the stage
Mama never told you there'd be days like these

And daddy never guessed you'd be on your knees
In the gutter baby
All you really wanted was someone to hold
But all you really got is left out in the cold
With nothin' baby
You got nothin'",There's More to Makin' Love (Than Layin' Down)
Curtis Stigers,"Love makes us laugh
Love makes us cry
We're up and we're down
We don't understood why
But we take it
We're just tryin' to make it

Sometimes we lose touch 
With our feelings inside
We put up our walls
When we injure our pride 
And we break up
Only to make up

Easy love has never been easy
I've been searchin' tryin' every door
'Till I finally found what I was looking for

And it takes what it takes
We all make mistakes
There are so many mountains to climb
But I know that our love will survive baby
This time

We heal from the pain
And we learn from the past
The future is ours
Girl we've found it at last 
We both know it
We can't help but show it

Baby so many times when the road got rough
We thought that we both had enough
But we kept it alive
Somehow the love wouldn't die 
It just wouldn't die

And it takes what it takes
We all make mistakes
There are so many mountains to climb
But I know that our love will survive baby
This time
",This Time
Curtis Stigers,"Back in the beginning the days flew by so fast
Well, we hung on every moment like we thought it would be the last
And every breath I drew, I drew it just for you
Now I don't know what to do to keep you beside me

And I remember time was
We were never in a hurry
Never had to worry, baby
Time was on our side

And I remember time was
The only thing we ever
Had to give one another, baby
But now it seems we're running out of time

And now we're always working, talking on the telephone
You're always going your way and baby, I go my own
Remember when we promised, we'd never let it come to this
But somehow we just missed our happy ever after

And I remember time was
We were never in a hurry
Never had to worry, baby
Time was on our side

And I remember time was
The only thing we ever
Had to give one another, baby
But now it seems we're running out of time

I've been so cold, I've been unkind
Oh, well, I left you alone, selfish and blind
But baby, I'm coming home, is there still time
To make it up to you

And I remember time was
We were never in a hurry
Never had to worry, baby
'Cause time was on our side

And I remember time was
The only thing we ever
Had to give one another, baby

You deserve something real
Time to heal
Time to feel

Daddy's favorite little girl
Dress up in your momma's pearls
Serve us breakfast stay'n in bed
Earn a little kiss on the forehead
You are sugar
You are spice
You are growing up so nice
Paint your nails
Paint your face
Paint around the empty space

Try and fill the hole inside
With a family and a home
Tell yourself you're not alone
Keep your memories of yourself

You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song

Some day my happy arms will hold you
And some day I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine!

She's out again tonight and I'm alone once more
She's all I have worth waiting for

And so it seems I've always been the last to know

I wish to God I didn't love her so
Cause baby plays around

I try to be strong hold on to my pride
She doesn't even know it's wrong, how much I hurt Inside
And heaven knows I've tried
But baby plays around, just a plaything

Until I'm almost mad

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

To the one that I keep missing every night and every day

There's things you learn to live with, now that's all I ever do
But I'll never get used to living without you

Now I got used to tenderness, we'd hold each other tight
And I got used to happiness, we'd make love day and night
And I'll get used to mornings, eating breakfast all alone
Sitting in the evenings, when there's no one else at home

But there's things you learn to live with, now that's all I ever do
But I'll never get used to living without you

Without you the sun still rises, without you the rivers run
I thought by now that I'd be realizing, what's done is done

I accept the notion that there's things you can't control
The changing of the seasons or the fact we're growing old
And I know I'm the reason that you had to go away
But I will keep believing that's the price I have to pay

But there's things you learn to live with, now that's all I ever do
But I'll never get used to living without you

Oh there's things you learn to live with, now that's all I ever do
But I never get used to livin' without you, without you, without you",It's So Hard Living Without You
Curtis Stigers,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

How about you son you like you've got

Wake and we part
Break for the day, oh
You take my heart
When can you stay? Oh
Day breaks my heart
Takes you away

Leave me in the shadows
Haunted by the low
Phantoms drenched in darkness
Love, a veil of stardust
Liftin' the center, the twilight
Rushes through the quiet
Shades have grown higher
Lovin' through the night, woah
Woah, woah, woah

Day breaks my heart
Takes you away, oh
Wake and we part
Break for the day, oh
You take my heart

Of midnight wire?
I dunno what came over me
I come across a burnin' desire
Fidgeting through madness
Spill the guilt

Rich or dyin'

And riddled with need I feel the gain
Of crowded shootin' sky
While smoothin' the plain
To soothe my fire safe
Across the midnight wire
Oh,the low
The storms of night
May help

I'd shatter up
And splinter
Through the frame
I'd look
Into the middle of
A rose bouquet
Waitin',wantin',
Livin' for the moment of release
Found myself
Caught on fire
Tried to jump the midnight wire

Spark of life, burnt out
How much long
I'll endure
Grow and measure
Of my calling
New song and tune
{?} are a waste
Leave you, rumble of my days
Oh,I'm afraid
So tired
Chained to fear
Not sure
Which one could
Make the cure
Oh, no
Cross the midnight wire
Rushin' up, rushin' up
Brushin' up, hushin' up
Pickin' up, mixin' up
Fixin' up, fixin' up
Duckin' the issue
Of the midnight wire

Midnight wire?
Who's that fallin' from the

Inescapable whatever we aim at
We line 'em up
The party is weak from the same rap

Or hear us later

Cut Chemist,"Yo, my metaphor, my musical madness
Move and motivate those with musical talents, uhh
Read it in bold print, we holdin' it down
Lick a shot, hip-hop when we in yo' town
Uhh, master blaster sound
Freak the future far from here and now
With style, release increase the peace, uhh
Bubble with the beat 'til they feelin' the heat in the streets
Now each one, teach one, reach one, young gun
On one, listen to the warrior's drum
Beatin' up the block with the ghetto hop that knock
And make you want to crash the spot
And unlock explode (boom) the alpha and omega code
With drum rolls and old soul, we uphold
And foretold to scores of six years ago
Fast flow from g. rap to cool moe
Supasyllable, major to the minimal
Every individual, bounce to the tempo yo
Lungs collapse and raps be trapped in
The only way to make it happen, jaw-jappin', fast rappin'

Yo, I'm the hot dog that run the hottest monologue
In star poetic inserts and yes y'all s
My speech is like holding two glocks apiece
The outreach that rock police
The super adventure men portend to put somethin' in bitches
Win when we write, the Emmy winner get hyped, off any printer
And I came to get it (hit it)
Like operation push, operate the tush
Black octopus of soul, in inter-planetary patrol
I planted my gold, and low and behold
It's the brother doc, ready to rock-rock
Don't stop hobbes, I known like the lumberjack chop chop
The wordsmith, I write in block letters of cursive
Curse my circus, serve this surface
And watch how the brother fet over
The fly Casanova with the frankincense odor

Bear witness
To where riches'll make career bitches share pictures
When the ears get this ya brainses software'll glitches
Splatter your brains
Leave scattered remains of matter and stains
That'll explain how you was battled and slain
I get rude and go, to your show and use a row
Of fans to boo and throw you off 'til you lose your flow
A pro mean like joe greene when I blow theme
Put your whole team on pause like cold cream
Then show laughter when I flow faster, your hoe haveta
Go after her weave from the breeze when I blow past ya
I'm dapper plus ghetto and just pedal
When the dust settles we left in the rubble the crushed metal
Nurses with hearses sealin' conversed with lit purses
Spit fire, make you first to bit, try me
Like Osama, odoma', I'ma cause trauma
And homicides when I collide I get kamikaze

Kane baby, walk hard, the p-jects
On streets of Brooklyn I'm a crew of d-cepts
On streets of l.a. I'm a whole e-set
On tracks with Jurassic I be the T-Rex
Still that Gucci dressin', still that coochie pressin'
My pimp game smooth be-gets 'em
I don't use discretion; cop tends to be stressin'
Fuck explainin' it, who's he testin'?
Finsta perform all physical forms
Leave your ass shakin' like a Mystikal song
Please dumb, what type of shit was you on?
Cause man to compress a nigga mean one less a nigga (uh-huh)
All I want is my niggaz all recruitin' a slimmy
All I want is my liver all polluted with remi
Duel with any, bring it, I face-off
Son you out your league like Jordan was with baseball

Yeahhh, your majesty, word flash photography
Third class economy, blade slashed your artery
Nerve gassed anatomy, blurred past dramatically
Herbs hashed, my word splash packed agility
Never predictability
Maneuvers of mind fully designed cause I'm true to the rhyme
We do the sublime, crackin' yo' backbone
Attackin' you wack clones
Vernacular right and exact, capital rap zone
That come back verbal assault rifle (ahhhhh)
We fight like Stokely Carmichael
Nope! we just like you
We broke and ain't no tellin' what we might do
Ain't no joke
Provoke the right to reverse to seek mercy
With the king Asiatic and Percy P
Ain't heard the worst of me, until your chest 3-d
Spit venom and burn your body like a std

Put a twenty on the next brother steppin' to me wrong
I mess around a lick cause you done cheat on my theme song
This might seem wrong, but this is a mean song
Crushed like king-kong, and just like ping-pong
Back and forth, I spit knowl' and toss, it's time to floss
My verbal affirmation is to always go off
When syllables slide you'll be enjoyin' the vibe
When consider it pride, it's J5
When another deadly medley, camera action yo we heavy
Aim steady slash machette Maserati engine ready
Good and plenty don't be petty count the fetti and we jetti
Off to another city where we do our nitty grity
We wild like Serengeti, tear it down let's seek and set it

Yo, this is a lesson in friendship
The depths of a kinship
What women and men begin with, and then slip
My pen drips
As I scribble my thoughts on thin strips
Of emotion
A fraction, seduction, attraction
Eruption of passion
Corrupts if a lasted friendship's involved
But love to cross the line
But that's why we built these walls

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine, but respect a thin line

[Akil]
Opposite's attract
When the female and male come in contact
Sticky situation in fact
Trying not to let the feelings catch
But there's a thin line between both of y'all
So you respect that
And entertain the idea, but get brought back
To reality, and could you really live with that?
Decision, based on intuition
You love and keep your distance
Hug and kiss in friendship

[Marc 7]
An ongoing kinship, we was people to begin with
Disrespect was not intended
But your feelings sparked the sentence
Sometimes you're too intense in your quest to invent
The perfect man, please understand, my rhyme is your repent

[Chorus: x2]

[Soup]
Man, too bad that we became friends first
I'm not on expert on how relationships should work
But, (echos) from the minute it as known
It changed the whole tone on how we spoke on the phone
Yo, it was cool but I felt it wasn't enough
And I was stuck when your moms would pick it up
Over you, all my buddies would swoon
But I felt we were in tune, you let me up in your room. (Damn)
But to me girl, you're still off limits
No matter all the times that I hinted (Yo, what you doing after this?)
Infatuation was authentic, but yo I just pretended
So I wouldn't lose the friendship
Maybe, I should spill all my guts
Or write a letter, then tear it up
Or do a song, just to say what's up
I want, just, a touch

[Chorus: x2]

[Nelly Furtado]
I can't do this anymore
See my heart just spills out when you walk in the door
Friendship turns into lust and this only tip
That I can't comprehend even if I knew it
Can't do justice to these things that I'm feeling
You got someone else, don't want to be caught stealing
Hell if she knew she would never leave us alone
In the room

[Chali 2na]
This was a lesson in friendship
I stress in this sentence
Should women and men be friends first?
And then slip?
My pen drips as I scribble my thoughts on thin strips
Of devotion

[Akil]
Opposites attract
And best friends make a perfect match
If you only knew that
Once you cross, ain't no turning back
The minute you let him in it and he hit that
That's that

We was people to begin with, but you was too relentless
Jeopardizing kinship, respect is intended
Resolve is my intent
While we got it in
I'm trying to salvage a friendship

And lately Ive been havin' visions of infinity
I'm the horizon, apple prizin' when my tales be survivin'

Papers that peddle the holy ghost
Once more the victim of circumstance pays

Sharpen your knives for a front page piece
Sitting safe in the front row seats

Frame me in photos in old soho

Like a blind man takes pictures
We pretended we could see
But it took all of our money
And it took you and me

there's a space in between us
But it's not inside my head
You can feel it all around you
Welcome to the wedge

'cause it's black and it's white
But invisible
So don't sign your name
It'll take all your trust if you let it
But never the blame

feel the wedge
You can look in its face but you can't see its eyes

from a dark and vicious circle
We were trying to break out
So sick and tired of second guessing
Dancing to the steps of doubt
The changes were blowing
Do you remember the hurricane?
But when big john took his final swin
We knew that nothing stayed the same

with a whambamagram it started
The saddest of days
Don't dare to ask was it worth it
I'm too broke to say

feel the wedge...
I could take all the bullshit but never the lies

over turns to under
Truth becomes a maybe
Six and five will still be ten
I'ts black and white and
It's not here tonight
It could be my friend

I have looked in its face
But you can't see it's eyes

The silver gray of [Incomprehensible] the dappled green of trees
Amber of a wheat field, hazel of a seed
Crystal of a raindrop are all I'll ever need

Your reds are much too bold, in gold I find no worth
I fill my days with [Incomprehensible] brown, the colors of the earth
And if from by my side my love should roam
The colors of my life will shine a quiet light to lead her home

You came along and everything's startin' to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come
Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine

Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine

We're gonna drain the cup dry
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground
Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near

Out of town were the people I knew

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm

Once upon a time, steppin on the scene
a dope-related youngsta, rappin hella clean
a cool type of stance, don't trip where he's from
to make interestin it's me Nummy-Num
I lived on Ave. what no one ever had
broke wit no be	-i's feelin hella sad
I lied
I stole
always hella bold
but I make no progress, never reachin no goals
my potnas they used to, smash and bash
talkin trash wit no remorse cappin on my raps
even worse than that to make me feel low
they drunk all they Hin, and smoked all the dope
and girls used to say ""Num you're so cute""
""but you get's no action 'cause you have no loot""
well one day walkin down Six-Duce
I seen a brother wit Shelly he's lookin hella juiced
he said ""Here ye here ye, check out my thang""
""if you can rap real good and got songs you can hang""
""I already got a rapper Dru Down I'm bout to start""
""you can rap on his tape if you can rip it apart""
so I ran home and wrote a new song
the tape went platinum it didn't take hella long
got a couple of checks and I, brokes out
moved to Hollywood, now they think I sold out.

*(Chorus-Luniz, Cydal & T Luni)*
Uh.
When you makin mo mail then they could
hatas think you goin Hollywood
Never would, Hollywood.
When you move up out the hood
hatas think you goin Hollywood.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

Verse 2 *(T Luni)*
All right stop what ya doin
'cause I'm about to ruin
the image of the game that ya used to
I look bummy
but peeps I'm makin money see
so yo world are you ready for me
now gather 'round, I'm the new playa in town
if you got mo grip then me, then I lay you down
I drink up all the Hennessy you got on your shelf
so step aside, it's time to introduce myself
I'm T the Luni
surrounded by doobies
condoms and groupies, love me more then they do Lucchi
(you do your thang)
an all the notches in the top ten
please allow me to do it
I'm a freak, I like the girls wit the boom
I once got busy in the studio bathroom
I'm crazy
straight gangsta mack
I only stay if baby got back
I'm serious
they want to swallow me like licorice
I never faze back, girls they too ticklish
an wouldn't ride no hoochie in the hood
they think I'm too good, rumor has it that I'm Hollywood.

*(Chorus)* x1
Verse 3 *(Cydal)*
I can't be broke 
I inhale too much bomb smoke
the game is savage, makin cabbage in the city of dope
when I'm home I'm writtin songs, an I don't stop
nobody step up, or press up, when I set up shop
I used to stand in the crowd, watch the dope fiends an wonder
man who them fools in the ice cream van
that's Nummy-Num and Yuk trick, don't you hear the music?
playas always haven't, but playa hatas use it
been out for the cash since the day I was born
til I changed it, rearranged it to a street game form
I write a rhyme, anger feedin 'em
every show you see me in
deep in M.O.B., 'cause ain't no folks surviving greediness
fiends being wild, so they need to be tamed
so I keep 'em all in shackles, 'cause they gotta be chained
then I'm back to the honey comb
where hustlas get they money gone
Oakland ain't no joke, we all no it ain't no funny bone
a public enemy
not even a friend of me
the Mobb, will stand beyond the click that why'all pretend to be
so don't be givin me this and that about the hood
'cause they know it's all good
I never could go Hollywood.

Verse 4 *(Yukmouth)*
I play the landlord, you be the apartment
you all know my name Smoke-A-Lot I gotta spark it
to get yo bitch started
who roll the hardest
me as the artist I gotta come out the largest
Yuk, I squat a Lexo's an Num's squattin Pala's
it ain't about who ballin 'cause we all clockin dollas
that's why 
I packed as an eagle
people be lookin at me smokingly roll by bomb-beagles
rap is like a kilo, of cocaine
illegal business and we in this dope game
buying so-an-so I'm a playa, I'm a mack
huh, but to me you ""geek-geek"" off crack
I smoke sacks wit the purple heads around from the Town
put that backyard boogie down,
you puffin wit Yuk, you know I blow greenery
you want to be like me the Ice Creamery
if yo ass ain't know by now I hits the scenery
so cleanery, sittin on chrome eighteeneries
I smoke a beedie, a tampa to the wood

If you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting

We loved to watch them dive and soar

Free as a bird from three to four
And never knowing why
Neighbors pulled their wash back in
Put away my Barbie and Ken
Look out overhead
While Sally's pigeons fly

That the world had no boundaries
But instincts and common sense
Come in different quantities

Skip to the beat
Of the boy next door
She had her eye across the street
On someone shy and tall
We lived our dreams
And challenged fate
In tears she told me she was late
And Sally let his pigeons out to fly...

On the dresser sits a frame 
With a photograph
Two little girls in ponytails
Some twenty one years back
She left one night with just a nod
Was lost from some back alley job

Cold to the touch
And hard on the soul
In the gray of the streets
In the neon unknown
I look for a sign
That I'm not on my own
That I'm not here alone
As the still of the night
And the choke of the air
And the winner's delight
And the loser's despair
Closes in left and right
I would love not to care
Stone, the world is stone
from a faraway look
Without stars in my eyes
Through the halls of the rich
And the flats of the poor
Wherever I go
There's no warmth anymore
There's no love anymore
So I turn on my heels
I'm declining the fall
I've had all I can take
With my back to the wall
Tell the world I'm not in
I'm not taking the call
Stone, the world is stone
But I saw it once
With the stars in my eyes
When each color rang out
In a thunderous chrome
It's no trick of the light
I can't find my way home
In a world of stone",The World Is Stone

It just takes a beat
To turn it around
Yes I'm waiting for you change of heart
At the edge of my seat
Please turn it around

Days go by
Leaving me with a hunger
I could fly
Back to when we were younger
When adventures like cars we would ride
And the years lied ahead still untried
While I stand here

Nothing reveals the answer
If it's truth that you're looking to find
It is nowhere outside of your mind

Cyndi Lauper,"I met a woman at the laundry mat
She left her sock in my dryer
I met a woman in a yellow cap
It said brimstone and fire
I said is this luck? With just a glance
She smiled, and I thought, is this a sign ?
From above or below? Oh no...brimstone...
Brimstone and fire...

The next week at the cinema
She pur her hand on my shoulder
She almost kissed me walking home
And I didn't even scold her
Then I said where is this leading with just a heavy sigh
I quickened my pace and she was following
As if her heart would never tire

I make spaghetti, she brings cake
I make spaghetti with tomato sauce,

And I say very low

I could fall into your dreams...

Are you the kind of man that I hoped you would or wouldn't be?

One I would keep...
And two I would put on your pillow with a lullaby...

Sometimes I'm afraid when you come home

Could you be the one comes rushing in.

Earth stood hard as iron
Water like a stone

Snow on snow on snow

May have gathered there
Cherubim and seraphim
Thronged the air

In her maiden bliss
Worshiped the beloved

Poor as I am
If I were a sheperd
I would give a lamb
If I were a wise man
I would do my part
But what I can I give him

One Christmas eve long ago
When I asked ""What you doing this evening ?""

She said she'd be waiting for Santa
She'd be wearing a bright red bow

[Chorus:]

What they're up to only
Heaven knows she wrote on a card
""Don't take it so hard we're headed for the North Pole""

Now Minnie could not be persuaded
That Santa just did not exist
She swore if she put up some mistletoe
Santa did come give her a kiss
And there where she'd hung up her stockings
All in their silky, soft, sheen
She'd be laying in wait on a bear skin rug
Where the cookies and milk could be seen

You had to set me free

I'm gonna beg you to (please baby please) see me
I'm gonna walk by meself

Living for you my dear

That our love is dying

Somehow I must explain

I'm gonna camp on your step

Cyndi Lauper,"We sleep together, close and warm
We calm each other through the storm
We set up home, but in a while
We're tempted by another's smile
When it's all played out

We dance around the fading light
You hold me closer every night
You fell in love but I did not
But in the end you're all I've got
When it's all played out
When the truth is known
You have to learn to live alone
We fly around the world too fast
We cannot make one moment last
We love the crowd, we sing and play
We do it all, we get our way

There's something greater than I dare to know
Look at me, pull the thread on this sweater
And watch it go

It can bring ya to the brink of lyfe
It can shake ya, it can make ya

Of what I learn to keep along the way everyday
Little one, I take your hand
And wonder how I'm gonna help ya be a man
And how I'll help ya understand

Two steps forward, one step back
Cover my mouth, choke
And pull down my hat

Into the seamless hope of an endless drive

White washing down trodden people
They're displayed like a grand masquerade
Making us feel better that we are brave

Like harmony, kindness and trust
Wisdom eluding me, wise guys using me
Peace, peace in, peace out

Won't you let me in
What's it like in your world baby

Just like everybody does
You stopped for gas and bag o' peaches

Let the wind blow through my hair
I want to know what it's like to take a road

You disappeared down route eighty-seven

Ride my high horse,right off that cliff
Move that mountain,cut it down to size

The sweet sweet kiss the one that used to drive me wild

When I saw you standing there
Close enough to touch

Is I'm dying here inside

There's not a night I haven't cried
And baby here's the truth
I'm still in love with you,

Cut just like a knife
Cut so deep it hurt
I held back the tears
Held onto my pride
And watched you go
I wonder if you'll ever know

Is I'm dying here inside

There's not a night I haven't cried

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.

Where have I been all these years?

How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Cynthia,"The sun went down and the night came through 
While my heart still lay deep inside for you 
Wishing and hoping for just one more try 
I refuse to wave the love we shared good-bye 
But it's not to late, no need to make you wait 
Your always in my heart, no need to hesitate 
It took us so much time for us to make it right 
So darling don't you wait, it's really not too late 

Chorus: 
So please make this an endless night 
With just a little love we can make it right 
Its there, I know I always loved you so 
I hope this endless night won't let you go 

Days pass by and still I wondered why 
The times we shared seem to slip us by 
The moments we spent were so few but true 
So come back to me, I'm still in love with you 
And though I know it may not be the same 
I'll try my best for now, no more time for games 
Cause deep inside I know our love is strong 
Knowing you and I would always belong 

Chorus 

But it's not to late, no need to make you wait 
Your always in my heart, no need to hesitate 
It took us so much time for us make it right 
So darling don't you wait, it's really not too late 

Chorus 

I always loved you so 
Was afraid to let you know 
Can't you understand it's true 
That I'm still in love with you 
I love you, I need you to love me too 
Oh, be mine and I will love you all the time 
I always loved you so 
Was afraid to let you know 
Can't you understand it's true 
That I'm still in love with you

Cynthia,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could

Cynthia Crane,"I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""this is absurd""
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this:
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
And long, long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered",I Gotta Right to Sing the Blues/Mood Indigo/Blue Prelude

Pulled to da curb, so we exchange a few words

The slamafied, (buddafied) funk on your discus
Oh, what you messed with, you got to bare witness
Catch a ho and another ho Merry Christmas
Yes I smoke shit, straight off the roach clip
I roach it roll the blunt at once to approach it
Forward motion make you sway like the ocean
The herb is more than just a powerful potion
What's the commotion, yo I'm not joking around
People learning about, what they're smoking
My oven is on high, when I roast the quail
Tell Bill Clinton to go and inhale
Exhale, now you felt the funk of the power
Now feel the effects

Cypress Hill,"I wake up every morning, kiss my wife goodbye
Hug my kids, tell em I love em, my mouth, hit the fried
I'm out on patrol, in my squad car, do I lay
Where you never know, if you'll be makin it home today
So many different attitudes, that I come across
I'm hard to console tonight, feeling nobody's lost
Hookers hustlers killers and thieves, out on the streets
Got my mind warped, just found another corpse on the beat
Bound gagged raped, I'm frustrated, I hate it
Found a woman in the dumpster, body was mutilated
Bad dreams all up in my head, no lie
Sometimes I gotta take a sniff so I can get by, why
Don't I get hurt, cause there go my nerves, I got the urge
To merge this bullet in my brain, relieve my pain
What a fuckin shame, I don't wanna live, I paint the wall
With the bloodstains, eye of the pig, I see it all

The eye of the pig

DJ Muggs cuts and scratches'This pig' from Pigs

I've been on the force, over twenty years, I can say
That I'm worse, than some of these motherfuckers I put away
I'm in the biggest gang you ever saw, above the law
Lookin through the eye of the pig, I see it all
Drug abusers, drug dealers and the gang-bangin
Pieces of shit who should be on the fuckin news hangin
These days you can't tell who's-who in the world
Is that a whore, or is that, an innocent young girl?
Fuck, I need a drink, and I'm almost off
At the precinct, it's like an AA meeting all gone wrong
I.A. got an eye, on my close friend guy
For takin a supply from evidence from a bust on a buy
That doesn't concern me, we never rat on each other
We went through the academy, just like frat brothers
Midnight, I only have an hour left on my shift
Think I'll get my dick SUCKED by this basshead bitch
My marriage is all FUCKED, my wife is with the neighbors
Subpeonaed, now I gotta sign these fuckin divorce papers
I recall, happier times, before the fall
Look into the eye of the pig, I see it all

Now I'm on my way, back to the station to check out
So I can go home, relax, take a drink and think about
My abrupt change, out of the clean, to the corrupt
Look into the eye of the pig, I'm all fucked
No longer can I determine, who's the criminal
From the innocent man down, to the pedophile
No one gives a fuck about me, I'm slippin
Into darkness, I'm comin to grips and feelin heartless
Watch this, a dark green truck, tinted windows
Duly modified, probably a dope dealer inside
""Pull it over to the curb, take your keys out ""
And raise your hands out the window and get em in high position
Don't move, or I'm gonna blast your fuckin head off
Just tell me where the guns and dope are and you'll get off
Don't give me that bullshit, I've heard about your raps
All you talkin about is slangin and shootin off the scraps
OK, Mr. Freeload, get the FUCK out of the truck
I love it how all you fuckin rappers think it's so funny
Hit the FUCKIN floor, I need no probable cause
You got a big sack of coke in your truck (what?) so take a pause
You find it funny? Get that smile off your face
Motherfucker take this

Scooby-Doo, y'all
Scooby-Dooby-Doo, y'all

I remember the time them niggas tried to get me (I ain't havin' it)
Throw your hands in the air, the Hill's live and direct, see
So let me put my clip in, watch this nigga start flippin'
My, why must they always be trippin'?
Shut up, what up, fool tried to nut up
Dropped the gat, riccocheted, the fool got cut up
(Why'd you drop the gat, G?)  I got hit from behind
Now a nigga like me, I gotta go for mine
Bring it on, bing, make ya bells ring
When ya hit that pavement, what a feeling
It's on, cracked like a baseball bat
Oh shiiiiiiiit, out the boot came a gat
Pointed (aimed) the nigga said ""You're through!""
Scooby Doo!  'Cause I had a boy too!

[Chorus]

I remember the time them niggas tried to get me (I ain't havin' it)
Throw your gats in the air if you want to come test me
So let me just run through, as I pull out my Scooby-Doo
I get the chills when I see that dead man's crew
I got to get up, let's go head up, dead up
I'm loc'ed like that, punk, that's why you're gettin' wet-up
Want me to let up, but I ain't tryin' to hear that
Bullshit cryin', punk, let me just clear that
Buck a shot, lick a two shot, lick a three shot
Ran out of ammo, damn, I ain't tryin' to get got
Two niggas standin', dirty under-handed
Lighter shade of fire, check my slug expanded
Now tell me what the fuck are you gonna do
When I pull out my Scooby-Doo?

[Chorus]

Take a good look 'cause this is the last time you're gonna see fat bell like this again, you fat piece a chit!  Kid muchacho, muchacho kid, get flabby - (oh - choot that piece a chit.)  You
fuckin' lobsta piece a CHIT!  I'll stomp you like a duck.  And you ...you with your little happy chain of lighters ...you want to fuck with me, you fuck with the best! And you ...you with the burly haircut, the Stawberry Quik guy ...you around the way, main. I know where you at.",Scooby Doo

Step back as I'm kicking up dust
For a while
As I put motherfuckers to rest
And pull their files

Out from the cabinet
With the picture
Get the 45 and settle it
With this punk nigga

Slow your roll
As I take control
Take your toke from the Indo'
Then hit and hold

Now let it out
How you feel when the herb
Got you by the balls
And you're coughing up a lung anyhow

You can't shake
That nigga that's gonna brake

As I pull the trigger
On my nine

Give the dog a bone
The raw dog
Fuck a law dog
Still handin' out beat-downs wit' my sawed-off
'Cause a every now and then I got to knuckle up
Buckle up

Everybody burning up, gonna get burned like Ses

You'd cry like a bitch
Don't twitch

Now lay down
Stay down
Don't move a muscle if you see your homeboy's brains on the ground
Don't fuck don't say nothin'

The homeboys and the brothers be slangin' this shit
But anyway, (everybody must get stoned (x4))
You over there singin' some shit, talkin' 'bout
Everybody must get stoned
I don't know but that shit sounds good to me

Hit the joint, up the bomb, take a puff
Till you just can't get enough of the skunk
A punk nigga named Doe wanna take control
But to free

My soul, puff on the endo (keep puffin')
Let me take it in then I let it out (let it out)
One of you motherfuckers pass the barred owl
Peace to the niggas in all the Buddha spots
Slangin' fat bags o' weed and runnin from the cops
(runnin' from them fools)
I hit the leno then pass it on
To the cypha' of dreadlocks gettin' stoned
(All the dreadlocks lya')
Roll a fat joint, twist it at the end
'Cos I get high with a little help from my friends (from my friends)

Everybody must get stoned, I said

Hit the blunt or the bong, take a toke
Now my head's in a cloud of smoke and no joke
Caught the up-tight motherfuckers puttin' me down
'Cos I talk about the green shit in every town (Everywhere I go)
You right in front of me, I can't see ya
I'm blind and faded and I got the cheeba
And everything's gonna be alright
When I pass that kush up on the left-hand side
Niggas is havin' a good time tonight
Roll it up, hold it up, pass me the fucking light
(Gimme that lighter)
Indo or the home-grown

We say, stoned is the way of the walk

In the midst of the madness no question, who's the baddest
MC's in the game running for the status
Take a few seconds to review the crews
Sitting on top is the Hill looking over you
Killa Hill Niggas, cream in my dream
Cooking up a scheme for all them big bank figures
The world is yours, but it can be mine and his
Bust you out the frame, I don't give a fuck who it is
Number one mission, opposition
Get thrown sent home in dead position
In the casket, best wishes
At the bottom of the lake, sleeping with the fishes
Full out search for the body
Of the MC's who be coming to disrupt the party
No wins, no ends, no way
That I'm ever gonna let ya come back again!

Check my dramatics, brains get splattered, dreams shattered
Sabas get blasted for words he packaged
Peep the sequence, crab adolescents, on his defense
Power-you niggas talking fast like Puerto Ricans
What you seeking, son I catch cream like Dominicans
Last Mohican, lyrics I'm speaking, wild as Indians
Tomahawk, Shaoling slang, the violent talk
Upstate New York, where chumps get extorted for Newports

Ease back, ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger

Words drop in chant, the cheeky-eyed slant
I'm taking these cannabis plants yo for grant'
Exotic, narcotic, tunes slam soon
From a dune in the desert Mega-Babylon pleasure
Coming out the dime piece, smell my aroma
Warrior nomad, put you in a coma
Comma, llama, smash-crashing your armor
Drama, I'm a, stealth aircraft bomber
Here is where I dwell at the gates o' hell
It ain't where you're from it's where you're in the mentals
And if not yo, credentials are essential
I see reality, few things surrounding me
Three like a spread, precise strikes the lyric
Not fronting or bragging, hundred percent red dragon
Pine fragranced lyrics, the rhymes you can't imagine
The globe-trotter, call me Meadowlark Lemon
Five part criminal, two part felon

That that that I'm ever gonna let ya come back again

Shisty motherfuckers, can't even trust my own brothers
So who can I choose to trust, me, that's who
Niggas want a piece of the pie, fuck off and die!
Jealous, envious fools want to rush this
Loco, trooping ass nigga with the cash, shit
Motherfuckers just get your own, and leave mine alone
Forty-five places to get done
Send out your invitation
To the party of your elimination
I got peeps that play for keeps, (Hardball)
Now I'm laying your ass down to sleep
But every hustler wants to be bawling
But I got the balls for the shot calling
I pull strings, the Don King, only in America
Then I hustle, and flex my muscle

Yeah, man, I've been out here
running game for eight years
I know I'm getting tired of standing
on this corner
Nigga, I want a fat pad, and fly ass pool
Finest motherfucking bitches, jewels
and all that shit, if I got to take it
from a nigga
Shit, let him run for me then
I can work for myself, don't have to
work for nobody, I'll be my own hustler

Where can I roam to get my hustle on

Loaded and cocked, I'm used to running with the Glock
Nina Millimeter, lighting up the fucking block
Now, who you gonna trust?, who can you trust?
I don't know, but if you coming on my corner
I think I'm gonna bust
You can't handle us, devious, dangerous
Criminal mentality, insanity
I move weight, from state to state
All the niggas moving weights, can you relate?

Damn, what's up, I see you
pushing that big time weight
I told you, I wasn't bullshitting
You coming up, alright!
When I seen you three or four
months ago I told you
Got respect for a man now
Handle your shit!

Where can I choose to get my hustle on?
In the alleyway, lighting up all night long
Fuck working at McD's, I'm rolling with the O.Z's
In the QP's, puffing on trees
Who can I trust?, who can you trust?
Not that shady motherfucker in the city Los Scandalous

Well, well, little man came up a little bit
It feels good having money in the pocket
Fuck that nine to five bullshit, right?
Yeah, kick that shit to the curb
But you got to look out for the scandalous motherfuckers
'cause niggas is tricky than a motherfucker
Yeah, but motherfuckers got to look out for us too
You know what I'm saying
I'm just as shisty as a nigga
Shit, set me up and niggas are gonna die

Let's talk about the one who had my back!
Down in the west coast, so lemme kick it
To the motherfucker who calls himself ""wicked""
No rest, no peace, no sleep
Doughboy rolling down the hill cause it's so steep
Jackson... lemme figure out the name
Jack cause you be stealing other niggas' game!
But I'm the wrong nigga you wanna fuck with
On my dick so hard, now ya wanna suck it!
Go on the head, gobble up the nuts
Get your lips ready & tear this motherfucker up!
Talk about Eazy, correct yourself
Cube, better step back & check yourself!

Hmmm let's talk about this
First solo album on the east coast dick
The east coast niggas all showed ya love
Especially the one known as King Sun
He tried to warn us niggas aboutcha
But nobody would listen
Even began dissin'
Two albums later, you callin' my crew
All because ya wannabe Cypress Cube (No way, motherfucker!)
Shoulda known you couldn't hang in the alley
Good boy went to school out in the valley
Fuck it, lemme make this understood
Speakin' on mama's little Boy N the Hood
No Vaseline
Just a rope and a chair and gasoline (burning your ass up!)
Lench Mob is a friend of mine
But you talk about them niggas from behind

A motherfucking pig that don't fly straight""
Where ya gonna run to? Where ya gonna hide?
Taadow! Look at who's running outside!

Natural Born Bullshitta
Lemme hit ya with a dose of reality when I get wit' ya
Your homie came knockin', he had to chain my suit
You put a pipe on your cover, even though you don't smoke Buddha
Let me take you down under on a plane
Where everybody was going insane
Took a look at the Real one: afro gone
The next morning, you didn't have yours on
How many ways will you bite my shit?
Would ya wet me or start throwing up a set?
Caution, when you enter the zone
Never used to bang 'til you heard the microphone
I got Cube melting in a Tray
Pulling up his card and fucking up his ""good day""

But all you get is a peeled back, dome cap
I'm not the one to be having that shit
All these punk niggas better bow down and submit
Niggas don't know how to ""keep it real""
Only if you niggas know the real deal
Fuck all the bullshit, Cypress Hill
Comes raining on your brain
Bringing the blood stains
Smeared on the sidewalk, one mark dome
of the prejudice skull, hanging in my home

The Big Game hunter, fucking shit up
Get your ass back down, the Hill's on the cut
Who'll get in the circle, let's see if you're raw
Hardcore, last vato might hit the fucking floor
Glocks and ?, in them one clip
For any buster who want to flip
Back ese ?, shining in your eye

With the pound in the pad smokein' up the indo

Hit it then pass it to the left
You can keep the mutha fuckin' stress
Smoke it up, just puff it up, (O yea)

Fuckin' sell out, nigga, this is hip-hop, not fashion
Get the hell out
I'm taking out these so called gangsta niggas
Takin' pictures, modeling clothes for small figures
And I neva took another fuckin' mc's shit
And made it my first single, for a hit
Fuckin' hypocrite, you can get the dip, when I lick a shot off
I'm gonna, and all of it
It's a damn shame when you got all these fools in the record indistry
Sellin' out for the fame
I just sit back and watch thes fools with their gimmiks
Go down in flames , in the big game

Zippidey-dooda, I smoke weed and I got brain damage
But, I don't give a fuck cause I still manage
To represent to the fullest
No pop singles, and no actin' foolish
To the studio gangsta with the articals
In them magizines with the bitch editors
Keep it real in the game
Niggas got no shame
Now all the executives want all the fame
Based on the videos, just a gang of silly hoes
For the fuck-em indistry that's take'n all ya dough
I neva stole it, stole it all
Just hard work, and sweat, for them platinum records on the wall
Fools want me to fall
I won't cause my roots are to thick and strong
Like the chocolate tastic
I hear niggas say no, but, I know they front
Cause afta they shows they want me to smoke a blunt
I don't respect a hypocrite, muthafuckas I despise
Cause me I tell the truth, even when I tell a lie

Cause you get checked fucked off, with no respect

I'm having illusions all this confusion's
Driving me mad inside
I'm having illusions all this confusion's
Fuckin' me up in the mind.

Mother fuckas be driving me up the walls
Hoping that I fall but they can lick my balls
Straight jacket strap it
In the padded room where some punk niggas can't hack it
Distracted from all reality now I'm let out
On a minor technicality, they all fucked up now
'Cause they let a nigga back on the street some how
I'm looking for some one like me
Living in my own world to my own degree
On the loose in the city looking at the ho with the titties
Looking at me and I feel shitty
A lil' tensed up getting hot
'Cause she looks like my girl who got smoked at the crack spot
I'm trying to find ways to cope
But I ain't fuckin' around with a gauge or a rope.

Pigs coming up and shining the bright light
Nothing better to do, than fuck with the pride
When you hide behind your badge, your gun and ride
Billy club show me no love, think you above
All the fuss and the locs is rushing in too close
Let me lay it on the table, forget stable
Freak niggas, coming to slay to the label
You got nothing to lose, come on choose
Stay away from niggas that bring down your crew
Whatever it takes, you make or break yourself
With the wealth or the chance to stay in good health
Sword blade swinging you back off away

16 men till there's no one left
Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo!

So many fucking emcees claim supremacy
On whose got hip-hop locked, it could never be
One who is solo, running the whole game
That's bullshit, like cops never sniffed cocaine
But I'm taking on all comers, dropping bombers
Reducing numbers, making it hot like the summer
This, one emcee he couldn't deal with the skill
Like Jack did Jill, I rolled his ass down the Hill
Beaten broken and coughing and choking on the rhyme
Like a hooker, sucking a dick for the first time
His, rhyme was hollow with no flow to follow
Bust a nut, all in your mouth, and made him swallow
I take 16 emcees, lock em in a room
Make em feel the contact, eating the mushrooms
Playing with your mind, making you feel the Force
Had to cancel out, two punk niggas up in The Source
Tried to get XXL, they still fell
Bitches go tell your troubles to Montel

Dysfunctional, hypocritical, smile in your face
The fucking cynical shit brains
As I sit back and say, tally-ho!

Guess you had a key to figure the fucking flow
But you're locked out, and the bomb's about to blow

Twelve punks to go, who's next on the list
Matter of fact I got one in my head to fix
There was one particular fool in the circle who fell off
Greed overcame the nigga who at all costs
Changed up to gain it all, but shared none
Who made him all the money to overcome?

He was rolling big balla style, high profile

And that bitch nigga who stole my car stereo

Can't forget the nigga who was down with the Hill-a
And that punk who tried to dip into the squealer

Shoot to thrill, be at the Hill, I/we take em all

Look look punk, every way you get shook
To the pawn, taking out the rook, off of the book
Lights get tooken, taken you for Satan
You can't breathe, no need to look up and see me
The last hope, when you mellow you call whoever
For the hype shit, you call the Hill, put it together
Running this game, bringing the same, raw shit
Over the hills, through the city we come equipped
to the letter, keeping your temperature down low
What I reveal, the good shit to heal all souls
Making you roll late night, you tripping, my game's tight
To the new shit I bring, never the same hype
so push that shit off, get up, don't let off
No matter how much blood you spit up
You could never be, fucking with Greenthumb
The outcome's specific, you spliff it, collapsed lung
We hit hard, breaking your guard, you can't tell
when the bells ring, busting your shell, the pawn fell

(Checkmate fool!)  Hang em high
Got the live shit, bang em whenever you/he want to try
Shoot to thrill, be at the Hill, I/we take em all
(Checkmate fool!)  Wherever the pawns fall
(Checkmate fool!)  Hang em high
Got the live shit, bang em whenever you/he want to try
Shoot to thrill, be at the Hill, I/we take em all

(Peek-a-Boo, you fuck you!)

I'ma freak that funk yea slam it in the trunk
I'ma kill all junk with the suicide clunk
Ain't nobody came my way, talking bout
the Westside of L.A., so whatever
punk-ass click you claim, you keep bumping that shit
and elevate your frame, cause I want that
big-time, asshole, studio gangsta
Worth a lot of shit, but that's not the main factor

My nigga Sen's rolling again, remember when
we rocked shows, battling foes, the time's been long
Strong with the styles, you ain't hear to win
Like blood pouring out of the pen, the ink stains
Slim chance if it gets in your brain, the hot flash
got you heated with repeated attacks over the tracks
Smack niggas up, back niggas up, hack niggas up
Jack niggas up, hanging the wack niggas up
Snowball effect, we rolling the city limits
Crushing the bitch-ass niggas with all the gimmicks

(Checkmate fool!)  Hang em high
Got the live shit, bang em whenever you/he want to try
Shoot to thrill, be at the Hill, I/we take em all
(Checkmate fool!)  Wherever the pawns fall
(Checkmate fool!)  Hang em high

""Hello Dr. Greenthumb, paging Dr. Greenthumb!""

Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
In the hills where the trees grow wild with weed fields
The fucking pigs with shields holding the blue steels
Greenhouse effect with the weed connect
(Doctor) DEA can't keep Greenthumb in check (Doctor!)
HPS, God Bless the whole crop
Please God, don't let me see no cops
Trunkload, ready to hit the highway
Don't let the eye in the sky fly my way
Or we gonna have big trouble, that's no shit
Can't be growing without no permit
But fuck that, I study the 215 trip
That way when they come they can suck my dick
Weed can't grow without attention
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb!

Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb!
I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
Ayo Dr. Greenthumb, come on back one time!

People can't live without the herb man
If not they'd be drinking and driving and swerving
But thanks to Dr. Greenthumb weed grow
In the backyard or inside with hydro
To the kush plant brushing a tangerine dream
Tasty, blowing a fucking smokescreen
Cycles of weed are constantly grown
Somebody give me the razor to cut groves
I'd like to stop, but it feels so good
Horny plants stinking up my whole neighborhood
Sticky angel, I want to leave it alone
But never ever ever gotta worry from my home
What that funny sound knocking at the door (Open up it's the DEA!)
Sorry Greenthumb can't talk no more
Please don't follow me into the sun
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb!
I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Out from the lab, no need for rehab
If I can't drive then call me a cab (ese!)
In my closet the weed is dried out
Like Eiht said, ain't no place to hide out
I don't want to buy no weed from no cop
Get knocked up and they close up my shop
That's why I buy no weed from no one
That's why they call me Dr. Greenthumb
The scientifical, mystical one
Growing my crops with the rays of the sun
Come one come all and see how it's done
If you see the pigs there's no need to run
Cause some of these pigs are down with Greenthumb
But you never know what be the outcome
You see the photo in the album
The weed is growing like my erection
Look I never told you where I was from
Some call me Real, but I'm Dr. Greenthumb

Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb!
I'd like to tell you just where I'm from

Now lately I've been finding myself, pouring my guts out
Expressing my thoughts, letting my nuts out in the walls
Of sleep, I can't keep it all in the hall clear
While others keep it inside for the pride they hold dear
Should of been, would of been, could of been the cops
Stop look and listen, you'll get a vision of hip-hop
Individuals looking to the battle the shadows of man
See it all, be it all, you need a plan
It takes one man to understand this
Learn fucking with a deadly gas, you get burned
From the window of my room, I shoot all stars
Every little bit you consume, the high cost
Of living it's all given to you, don't lose it
Every man's given a tool, but don't use it

[Chorus]
From the window of my room, I shoot all stars
Every little bit you consume, the high cost
Break free, you're selling your soul, for a fee
But all that shit ain't worth it, you burning up see
The window of my room, I shoot all stars
Every little bit you consume, is high cost
Break free, you're selling your soul, for a fee
But all that shit ain't worth it, you burning up see

[B-Real]
From the window of my room, the gloom spreading across
The land of milk and honey, no money to feed the boss
Funny the cost of life, cut clean blood streams
Out the body, nobody wants you dreaming about shorty
No longer don't need a 40 to take away any pain
So punk me and I'll give you the world exact change
Or quote me and you're never the same, I claim no one
I show none the weakness individuals go forth ya seek this
Wherever I roam is home to me
You Shogun, look at my enemies try to do me
The influential status, you know the baddest
Lookie here, show you what that is, bringing the madness
Sadness to those appealing to any conflict
Looking out my window pane, I see you falling
What are you a man or a mouse, the house light
Shining within, that's when you begin to live again

Everybody want respect, but you gotta collect
Only hardcore vatos on the set
Don't get me wrong but some rhymes get twisted
There it goes, the pride, you missed it
I ain't upset with the motherfucker dissing
Find me in Watts when you want to come hit me
Some shit ain't what it seems, in the land of dreams
Some sell their soul to get the cream
From the teens I don't sling or slang no crack
I'm known for bringing in funky ass raps
See those magazine crews and I'm a goner
Dull interviews with these damn primadonnas
Unlike some of these fools on the turf
Look like the real thing, but they soft like Nerfs
So unrehearsed that it shows in the product
Need to get the fuck out, before you get caught up

Cypress Hill,"Now this some bad weed
  
The very first time I hit the weed I was young
Coughing up a lung, high strung, back in '81
Going to school, hitting the Buddha behind the bleachers
Coming to class high, selling the lye to the teachers
Nickel bag, nickel bag, dime to a nickel
Selling joints to the honeys suck it like an icicle
Others wanted the 40 but I wanted the weed
While everybody was running out, I was planting my seeds
Homegrown, backyard boogie, I'm still stoned
Got my weed plants taller than your telephone's corner
I can remember when I could only get sess in those days
Now I'm rocking that chocolate Thai, skunk and the haze
Roll a fat one, pass it to the left don't front
But I hate it when they don't take the seeds out the blunt
A bunch of blunt-rollers are like rookies on the field
Spilling the weed plant fucking dookies with no skill
I should write a book, how to roll it then pass it
Light it, grow it, sell it and then divide it
Mr. Greenthumb, Dr. Weed, I proceed to give the herb man what they need
True indeed, blow your fucking smoke up in the sky
And get high with your bong or your Philly or dutchess give me a light
  
[Chorus]
Grab the weed up, pack it in, put it in the pipe
Light it up, smoke a bowl, we puffin the lye right
Put your finger on the hole and hold it in brother
Take a puff, that's enough, and pass it to another
  
Get the weed sack, smoke it up, til it's all gone
No roaches up in the ashtray, smoke up all the bomb
I use to spend money but now I'm growing the crops
But I hate it when the pigs throw a raid on the spot
It was once said I smoke so much weed, by a brother
That I look like the nigga on the zig-zag cover
Maybe I use to look like that way back when
When my nigga Sen Dog was around sippin on the Hen
Let the fly rhymes smother you with the scent of the skunk
We got the High Times cover shows you how to roll a blunt
Quarter pound, quarter pound, pound to a quarter
Making trips to Mexico running down to the border
Long hairs, bald heads, dreads and punk rocks
Kids of all colors be puffin it down the block
I got the weed on lock with all the hydro methods
Call me Puffy cause I making and taking a hit record
Blow your fucking smoke up in the sky and get high
With the bong, Philly or dutchess, give me the light

I wake up every morning, kiss my wife goodbye
Hug my kids, tell 'em I love 'em, I'm out, hit the ride
I'm out on patrol, in my squad car, do I lay
Where you never know, if you'll be making it home today
So many different attitudes, that I come across
I'm hardened and scarred tonight, feeling nobody's loss
Hookers hustlers killers and thieves, out on the streets
Got my mind warped, just found another corpse on the beat
Bound gagged raped, I'm frustrated, I hate it
Found a woman in the dumpster, body was mutilated
Bad dreams all up in my head, no lie
Sometimes I gotta take a sniff so I can get by, why don't I get hurt, cause there go my nerves, I got the urge to merge this bullet in my brain, relieve my pain
What a fucking shame, I don't want to live, or paint the wall with the bloodstains, eye of the pig, I see it all

The eye of the pig

(""This pig"")

I've been on the force, over twenty years, I can say that I'm worse, than some of these motherfuckers I put away
I'm in the biggest gang you ever saw, above the law
Looking through the eye of the pig, I see it all
Drug abusers, drug dealers and the gang-banging
Pieces of shit who should be on the fucking noose hanging
These days you can't tell who's-who in the world
Is that a whore, or is that, an innocent young girl?
Fuck, I need a drink, and I'm almost off
At the precinct, it's like an AA meeting all gone wrong
I.A. got an eye, on my close friend guy for taking a supply from evidence from a bust on a buy
That doesn't concern me, we never rat on each other
We went through the academy, just like frat brothers
Midnight, I only have an hour left on my shift
Think I'll get my dick sucked by this bass head bitch
My marriage is all fucked , my wife is with the neighbors
Subpeonaed, now I gotta sign these fucking divorce papers
I recall, happier times, before the fall
Looking through the eye of the pig, I see it all

Now I'm on my way, back to the station to check out
So I can go home, relax, take a drink and think about my abrupt change, out of the clean, to the corrupt
Lookin through the eye of the pig, I'm all fucked
No longer can I determine, who's the criminal
from the innocent man down, to the pedophile
No one gives a fuck about me, I'm slipping
into darkness, I'm coming to grips and feeling heartless
What's this?  A dark green truck, tinted windows
Duly modified, probably a dope dealer inside
""Pull it over to the curb, take your keys out of the ignition""
And raise your hands out the window and get em in high position
Don't move, or I'm gonna blast your fucking head off
Just tell me where the guns and dope are and you'll get off
Don't give me that bullshit, I've heard about your raps
All you talking about is slanging and shooting off the scraps
OK, Mr. Freeload, get the fuck out of the truck
I love it how all you fucking rappers think it's so funny
Hit the fucking floor, I need no probable cause
You got a big sack of coke in your truck (what?) so take a pause
You find it funny?  Get that smile off your face

Greed means that you die quick, click the vision
Greed lies anmbition, five slugs for the mission
Seven cause you go to the heaven or hell and dwell
to meet your maker, but you met the shotgun shell

When gats start to hum and whole crowds begin to run
Annihilation, destroying all expectations
Have relatives embrace your Harlem hospital, we all patient

With fixed sights that drifted to right, triggers light

From the Hills to the Polo realms, stacking the bills

Met the connect, who was impressively dressed
In high fabrics
With troops like Babe Ruth, up on the mezzanine
Brandishing sub-machine guns, aye-yo
It's all about the money, son
Now that's the only reason
We came south of the border, to complete this work order
We gotta get it, no looking back, going all out for it
Ready to attack, die in a minute flat for it

Not like these fools who don't comprehend
You end up doing a twenty-five bit in the pen
You got that? Getting your cup, I took a swig
The bitter taste of the 'mezcal', free worm shit
Droppin' a lesson, he slapped my face, he said listen
Pay attention brotha, you're my ace, but don't ever question
Just do what I say, and you'll be rich
And keep this in your mind: rats lay in a ditch with no spine
Don't ever forget that golden rule in the game
Cheers, they all know your name, it's like fame
Why, women and money don't mix, like drinking an' driving
Watch those conniving women and keep your eye out
Always be aware of what's around you
They wanna down you, and fuckin clown you
Keep your shit in order the money won't stop
Pretty soon you'll be on top

Better kill me, don't let me return, motherfucker
Trust no man, cause I'll be back, you understand?
With a plan, and my ice in hand, I want it all

Better go get it, don't let it get to your head, embed it
Let these words stick, you better be ready to die

[Chorus]
So you want to be a rock superstar? 
And live large 
A big house. Five cars, You're in charge. 
Comin' up in the world. 
Don't trust nobody got to look over your shoulder constantly

I remember the days when I was a young kid growing up
Looking in the mirror, dreaming about blowin' up 
The rock crowds. Make money. Chill with the honeys. 
Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me.
Shit's funny how impossible dreams manifest 
And the games that be comin' with it 
Nevertheless, you got to go for the gusto 
But you don't know about the blood, sweat, and tears and 
Losin' some of your peers.

And losin' some of yourself to the years past, gone by 
Hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy 
Egomaniac and the brainiac don't know how to act 
Shit's deep 
48 track studio gangsta mack sign the deal 
Think he's gonna make a mil but never will 
'Til he crosses over, still 
Fillin' your head with fantasies 
Come with me 
Show the sacrifice it takes to make the G's 

You want to be a rock superstar in the biz 
And take shit from people who don't know what it is 
I wish it was all fun and games 
But the price of fame is high 
And some can't pay the way 
Feel trapped in
What you rappin' about? 
Tell me what happened when you lost clout? 
The route you took started collapsing 
No fans. No fame. No respect. No change. No women and
Everybody shits on your name. 

[Chorus: x2]

People see rock stars, you know what I'm sayin'? But you still try to get out 
More like everybody else, you know, its a fun job, but its still a job. There's 
Gonna be another cat comin' out,
Looking like me, sounding like me next year. I know this. It'll be a flipside 
Tell what you did someone trying to spin off like some circus.

You ever have big dreams? Or makin' big cream? 
Big shot, heavy hitter on the mainstream 
You want to look trendy in the Bentley 
Be a star band, never act friendly. 
You want to have big fame 
Let me explain what happens to these stars and their big brains 
First they get played like all damn day 
Long as you sell everything will be ok 
Then you get dissed by the media and fans 
Things never stay the same way they began 
I heard that some never get fooled to the fullest 
That's why fools end up dining on a bullet 
Think everything's fine in the big time 
See me in my Lex with the chrome ray shine 
So you roll far and live large 
It ain't all that goes with being a rock star

[Chorus: x2]

My own son don't know me 
I'm chillin' in a hotel room, lonely 
But I thank God I'm with my homies 
But sometimes I wish I was back home 
But only no radio or video's gonna show me no love 
They're phony 
Got to hit the road solely so the record gets pushed by Sony 
I'm in the middle like Monie 
And the press say that my own people disown me 
The best way back to keep your head straight 
Never inflate the cranium 
They're too worried about them honeys at the Palladium 
Who just want to cling on, swing on, and so on 
Go on fall off - the ho's fall off 
To the next rock superstar with no shame 
Give him a year and they'll be right out the game 
The same as the last one who came before him 
Gained fame started getting' ignored 
I warned him 
Asured him this ain't easy 
Take it from the weazy 
Sleazy people want to be so cheesy 
They're fucking evil 
Assassins, assassins

[Chorus: x2]",(Rock) Superstar
Cypress Hill,"Hell nah
You can't handle a man of my superior strength 
I've been rockin' for years, now it's time to go to length 
Bitin' emcees in their tracks I stop 'em

My concepts come sick like Dennis Hopper
I jack fools up and stick em like dirty coppers
Like I said before I'm takin' you lame whores
Down to the phone, knock his ass on your good balls
Only one way to deal with these softies
Take they ass out like heroes and they flossin'

From comin' though
The reality is out with the old 
And with the new
Ways and things change
With strange haids of braids shade?
Switch place life and life plays with thumb pain?

Out the whole stroke away so I can listen-a

But if it ain't in peace bro turn it to a homicide
Throw you in the trunk take a ride to the Eastside

Fool drop your weapon or I'm coming for the kill
Duck from the gunshots that is sticking to ya
Standing all alone shotgun goes boo-ya
Watch it go through ya 
Ya smelling like manure
Fools all bloody body chilling in the sewer

Sitting back chilling with my nigga SonDuhla
Heading to the Eastside watch your back busta
Ain't no hood for you here it's all about the hustlas

For ever backing up that Cypress Hill click
To my man on the corner with the shotgun shell 
Singing sad songs for the ones that fell
To me it's kind of funny watching all these dummies
Straight turn tricks for the fame and the money
Walk a little bold 'cause their record went gold
Got him a new ride and up rid it their ho
Need this looking raw before you come acting
Flexing on some brothers that is twelve times platinum
Cause I been there 
Done that 
Fool check the format 
Sweep you and that bullshit under the doormat
Put it to your grill like I don't give a damn

Yeah y'all, that big bad Cypress and perro up in that place
What the fuck you wanna do now huh?

Kicking that funky Cypress Hill shit
Think I blast another give them something to deal with
Cause I'm the ill one 
Oh the cap-peel one

Living on the Eastside fighting for survival
Gotta be nifty with the Han Solo and trying to show yo
Witnesses cause people will use it to kill your show yo
Off to the stone garden you go and stay there
When I'm dead I'm bringing my music to play there

What you want to be?
Everything I am now
But you never worked for it
The live it, you fucking gimmick
What you want -- disease?
For me and my homies
Niggaz want to act, damn
You don't even know me
What you need to breathe?
To think it over clearly
You can hear me over the speaker
It's best you don't come near me
What you got for me?
Back up and a lot of weight
But now, you hating on me
In every single way
What you have with me?
To make me turn the switcher
Funny how money makes a fucking little picture
What it's got to be?
You get disconnected over methods you choose
To make yourself get ejected

[Chorus: x2]

[Sen Dog]
What you want from me?
Pictures and the demos
You want to act funny?
And hear my ?
What you got to see?
I need a little privacy
You don't even know of the shit that driving me
What you need from me?
Someone to put your shit on
Never forget what I've done for you
Before you get on
What you have to be?
True to the family
And fuck 'em and feed 'em
If you ain't understanding me?
What you want to be?
Hard or a pop star
Going out and doing the same shit
That's a love song
What you want from me?
Nothing but burn riches now
I should snap your jaw
And knock it off the hinges
What you after me?
Doctors and nurses and hearses
And the worst thing you feeling
The blood curses
What you have to be?
Gone another memory
Remember this if I gotta choose over them or me
I'll choose me motherfucker you understand

Cypress Hill,"Most people don't see how much work is really involved
In this rap shit
I didn't know it
I didn't see it
I never saw it until I was actually in it
You really gotta be in it
To understand what its like
But you always gotta
People always gotta see your smile
You always gotta put on that fake
You know what I'm saying
No matter what you just been through

So you want to be a rap superstar
And live large a big house
5 cars, you're in charge
Comin up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

I remember the days when I was a young kid growing up
Looking in the mirror dreaming about blowing up
To rock crowds make money
Chill wit the honies
Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me
Shits funny
How impossible cream manifest in the games that be coming with it
Never the less you gotta go for the gusto
But you don't know about the blood sweat and tears
And losing some of your peers
And losing some of your self
Music has past gone by
Hopefully you don't manifest for the wrong guy
Egomaniac in the brainiac
Don't know how to act
Shits deep
48 tracks
Studio gangsta mack
Sign a deal emcees want to make a mill
But never will
Till he crosses over still
Feeling no hate
But fantasies come wit these
Just to sacrifice the taste of makin cheese
You want to be a rap superstar in the biz
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games
But the price of fame is high
And some can't pay to play
Trapped in what you rapping about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout
The rout you took started collapsing
No fans
No fame
No respect
No change
No women
And everyone shits on your name

So you want to be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house
5 cars
The rent charged
Coming up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house
5 cars
The rent charged
Coming up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

When you sign to a record label
You don't know you sign your life over
And these whiteboys don't care about you
'cause the minute you fall off
They'll find another Noreaga
And they'll find another Capone-n-Noreaga
And they'll find another be	-Real
So you need to just keep
Stack your chips up
Do what you gotta do while your hot
And motherfucking get out the game
Stick to the drug game
And the drug game is even worse
Because if someone jerks you
You can shoot em and kill me
But in this game if someone jerks you
You gotta be humble

No matter what you just been through
Shit has gotta be right
You gotta approach people
You gotta be on the up and up
And everything gotta be all good
When you see someone slap hands with em
You know what I'm sayin give em a pound
Or whatever it is
But you always gotta act like it ain't shit

So you want to be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house
5 cars
The rent charged
Coming up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house
5 cars
The rent charged
Coming up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

My own son don't know me
Sitting up in the hotel room lonely
But I thank god I'm wit my homies
But sometimes I wish I was back home
But only no radio or videos
'cause they show me no love
The phony gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by Sony
I'm in the middle like monie
And the press say that
My own people disowned me
And the best way back
Is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
Your crew worried about them honies at the palladium
Who just want to cling on swing on
And so on and go on and fall off
The hoes fall off
To the next rap superstar
Wit no shame give him a year
And they'll be right out the game
The same as the last one
Who came before him
Gained fame
Started getting ignored
I warned him
Assured him
This ain't easy take it from weezy
Sleezy people want to be cheesey
They talking evil

So you want to be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house
5 cars
The rent charged
Coming up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house

The rent charged
Coming up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly",(Rap) Superstar

Never get your ass caught up with a stank hoe
Pussy weigh deeper than a big fucking ?zinko?

You want to copy my style go to Kinko's
Watch me reload it just like Carlito
My style so dope they should label it illegal
You want beef then I call my nigga Steebo

The hitch is, you're getting too big for your britches 
Why you running like bitches 
With your tail up, I'm the thug pirate
Put the sail up, your whole crew frail, what 
You want this joint, suck it inhale nut 
Niggas are feelin' this track in Braille, huh 
We're grade A while you motherfuckers fail, what 
You understand, imitators gotta bail up 
To all the males and females gangin' up 
All on my cell phone talkin' shit, hangin' up 
I gotta show you how a nigga bang it up

You're minor leagues with major
Detail the plans like verse

You know I hate it when I roll a joint and give it to somebody
Who ain't got weed but they want to be up in the party
Laughing and giggling, sipping on a Heinie
Son you need a Tic Tac your breath is gonna blind me
Talking about you want to hit, spitting in my eardrum
Oh you new in the cypher, step to the rear son
Still they manage to hit it, and put they grip on it
That's when they wet the tip and put they lips on it
Then when you get it, forget it, it's been wetted
Who gonna hit it now, not me, you got me
Thinking about these fucking jokers, double tokers
Smokers who hit it like they sucking a dick, fuckers
Flipping it, loving it, smoking it to the head
Giving it to me half way down, ""thanks again""
Then when you see 'em later smoking they own stash
When you ask 'em for a hit, they say, ""sorry this is my last""
I shared some with you, ""Sorry that's not my problem
Talk to the hand but I got plenty if you want to buy some""
These people piss me off, this is true indeed
But nothing's worse when someone's asking for some weed
What do I look like a tree where the bud grows
Here pick my left nut and smoke it in the bol
Or better grow your own leave mine alone
Here I'll give you a clone now raise up outta my zone
I know I got the best weed, but don't make me
Make your burnt chest bleed what you need
Is weed etiquette, please don't be offended
'cause the weed costs money I'm the one who has to spend it

And that's just the way it is man
Y'all motherfuckers need to learn
You just can't come, asking for some shit and not giving none in return
What the fuck is that man? We going into 2000 motherfucker
You need to learn how to smoke some weed with people

I won't let ya I bet ya I reign supreme
Make your fans forget ya search ya in front of your team
Make a nigga smoke a ounce and bounce over the rhythm
And hit em and get another suck and hit em with venom
Nigga my name is Sen and I'm real while you're pretending
Suckers with no style I hope you get offended
So I can lock your ass up with my jawclutches
Then my rhymes will catch you cause they're sharp like Tony Touch's

Yeah, that's right y'all
Gonna smash you in the face

So many motherfuckers out there talking shit, doing their little thing
It's cool you know what I'm saying, go ahead make you money 
But don't you be coming around me perplexing playing like a bitch 
You know what I'm saying 
Cause I can see your ass right through you know what I'm saying
You're glass homeyboy, you're glass you know what I'm saying
Don't play me too close y'all 
I don't think I like you too much you know what I'm saying
Always kicking it, doing what we do
Trying to act like us, trying to sound like us
You're playing me too close motherfucker
You need too step the fuck on back
Take your ass on back to wherever the fuck you come from
You're playing me way way too close you know what I'm saying",Certified Bomb

Listen, the system is pissin' me off, you want to feel my pipe
Fingers pointed, anointed people, day better up to the knight
Whispers, darkness the hardest, time ain't never gonna feel alright

Cut you up, with my sisters
You want to get us, yeah, the venom spitters
Your style's trash: don't litter
You got the jitters the hard hitters
No quitters your soul quivers
When you see the gats blazing, get out the street now
There ain't no use for you begging to turn the heat down
You label me coldblooded
You want to warm me up with hot lead the gat thudded
You can't cut it 
You wack, but it's, no use your mouth shut it
Shooting arrows diamond-studded, and still budded
You got to love it, you better chase the paper all day 
So you can walk down the long platinum hallway
But now the fools are minutemade,
They get played for a minute 
Then played out they never get back in it
Gun park I bring chalk for your body outlined on the floor
You got hit by the 4-4!

Street corner kids growing up blowing up
You chase dreams you want the highlife, with the skylights
But in the end your soul's lost, you lost the shine right
Never turn your back ever, on niggas true to you
Stand alone for the cheddar, and they'll be through with you

Niggas getting softcore, the people want more
Hardcore shit that's why I give them an encore

You can't figure out the formula so you're stealing it 
Can't stand unoriginal cats with minimal 
Skills that's criminal, you fake bitches!
You're looking for riches, in the wrong places
The faces of death look you in the eye cut off your breath 
When you fall feel your knees shatter
The bones breaking with your weak blatter
Pissing on yourself it don't matter
Dead weight, the bed waits for you on the set date
Dreams gone instead fate didn't hesitate
To put you away, close the gates now you're locked out
Your life: cable, with all the porn channels blocked out (damn!)
What you good for?  Nothing, so be gone suckers
Have a nice trip see you motherfuckers!

Of the Cypress Hill weed funk blazing up a path
You can't help, but inhale and get strong
You need that good shit all up in your lungs

Letting the niggas see where my mind is at
Hurry up to the walls see how I react

And take each day the bullshit don't stop
Got to act with the man cause I don't suck cock
No matter how bad I want to get to the top

With the key and the ? I rap and just stop
Come and see me on a ""soul assas"" trip

Only thing I don't want to say when I drop em

Don't mean coming back when they bust the raps
And all the little things of the nicer tracks

Your body and buries two more lyrics in styles varied
Fool what?  You ain't got nothin' to say

To break out before you resemblin' a dead man
A hole through your headband
My gat's in my right hand, my plug's in my left hand, punk
Cypress Hill worldwide, you just a local
Don't anger me, or you can hear it in my vocal
You don't want that strap on my hip
To deal out, the repercussions dug a fat lip
I'm buckin' at the room soon to the boom
Fuckin' with your head like the 'shroom you consume

I take money-money, make dummies all night
Use the mic, bruise the mic, we choose the mic
When you sorry niggas go off and lose the mic
We choose a life right, we roll with crew tight
See the light at the end of a tunnel, a gat barrel
Wettin' up your flyest apparel, a cane ray
You forget me and I'll be back to refresh your fuckin' memory
Remember me now, Cypress Hill soldier
Up and down the boulevard, big money folder
You bring descript sequence with no defense
The whole defense hittin' the bones while you sleepin'

Flavor of the month, bro, ? try to dispatch
Always got the good badge, take it to the head
Got me wasted like Jerry from the Grateful Dead
Don't trip, get a grip, be strong and don't fake it
Or else you get beat down, an' stripped butt-naked
I just kick the lyric, straight from the spirit
You can tell I got soul first time as you hear it

When you deal with the Hill, keep your mouth still
If you rely on your skill then rely on your steel
If you have no ideal, or any thoughts to feel

Busters stop to deal
But I face them, quicker than takin' a box of pills
Now you gots to chill
Get cops and sheilds, steady, hark the (?)
If they're lookin' for prey, ready to stalk and kill
As I lock the wheel, don't you mock the drill
'cause I'll cock my steel, make you drop and spill
Got no mercy unless you talk to deal
Quit talk and kneel, you won't top my will, bitch!

Real South-siders from the heart of LA
Now, back in the day we had big success
And it's like that now and we won't settle for less
You can beat the LB from the new Latin lingo
Nowadays you nothin', without a hit single
Time to get loco, and put bodies in motion
Hit the stage in a rage, and start up a commotion

I slam it like the art and make sure it's broken

I lost my innocence at birth but I make no excuses
For the trivial things and the pain life induces
Bitches are wild, and so was I, young and stupid
It's incredible, what a shitty circumstance produces them
Criminals, led by the originals, high strung, motivated by the, principles
Some of us out, he used to think we were invincible
On the corner bangin' and slangin' the high bitual
Deadly rituals fill my head, nothin' spiritual
Bullets filled up bodies like hands from my physical
I got touched by the hot hands of bitter fools
Divided and tempted snake bitten by the ridicule
Frustration and hate filled my adrenaline
I play doctors here's two bullets for your medicine
I carry those days like a weapon close to me
The memories of hot lead rippin' a hole through me

[Chorus]
Son, fill your heater, how bout chase killer
Rock 'em up and show you're no quitter
Snakes' pit every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong

Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
Snakes' pit, every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong

Faces change, liscenses' everywhere you turn

They turned they back on us and they tried to provoke us
You ask about us, you talk trash about us
Walk fast around us, but my block fast allowed us
Don't try to crowd us nigga, we'll smack you up
Look around and see who's willin' to back you up
You're in a ghost town and home alone like Macaulay nigga
Don't say my name nigga, don't even think of me
Fire start spittin' from my grill piece, ya scorched up, touched up
I'm the C4 that blew up your porch
I spit venom quicker than the punch on your Porsche
Venom so deadly I'll make your fuckin' life divorce ya
Ask for Alamoney, bitches, you all phoney
I'll make you sing the blues like you're Paulpau Coloney
Go ask Moley, you in the middle of shit
And anything you say I'll be known the shit
The force drops hits a ball, makin' me die of laughter

People who I thought were down, and see true
But I blame me too 'cause it's a  Chronicle 
My life, I realize I'm responsible for obstacles 
In front of me, my own self to blame
But I worked hard to receive the wealth and fame 
It's a worthless game, but if you're willing to play
There's sharks in the water who are, willing to pay 
The price of your soul, but if you give it away
You silly motherfuckers are all committed to stay 
It's a cold world, but you still want a part of it
So then you'd better fuck around and learn the art of it
Don't walk through life with your blinders on

Cypress, is Worldwide and we like it that way
You can't fade-ER, or compare TO
The Original Pyscho-Baiter 
Got the next rhyme and we'll check you all later 
Can't nobody fuck with them Cypress Hill Raiders
Heard it all before and I don't need no more 
Advice on the game and how to kick hardcore
Played the game out here with the best
Toured around the world and got big respect 
Now, what's ? all with this year 2000's?  
We putting the Smackdown and we ain't clownin'
Not many have lasted
Since we first blasted
Up on the scene, singin' about the dream
Recruitin' for our team, niggas know what I mean
""Damn"", you defy, when you live or die

[Chorus: x2]

[B Real]
Times I hated, times I waited
Times I went by where I was drunk and faded
They said I wouldn't make it, but where are those people now?
Still hatin', creatin' all the evil now
Your insecurities are showin', exposin' you 
You're trippin' on me and showin' emotions too
Don't you spend your life full of envy, it's deadly
Heed me, as I spit the venom believe me

[Sen Dog]
I keep my guard up, and always let you see my rage
I get pissed, like a pitbull in a cage 
Not that many can deal with the fury
Attack and ransack and kill in a hurry
I kill and observe and go in an instant
I bring the pain like the ?Rampark? Prison  
I kept it right for the brother to the Chullo
Something I bump when your gates in the ?

[Chorus: x2]",It Ain't Easy
Cypress Hill,"[Chorus]
You don't know no real shit, nigga (It's the real shit)
This the original Cypress Hill shit, nigga
We numb niggas, ya don't feel shit, nigga
You ain't on no real shit, nigga

'91 ('91) Cypress Hill burst upon the scene
Three crazy, gun-totin' niggas smokin' weed
Talkin' about life on records was the whole plan
So we put out The Phuncky Feel, but you were feelin' Kill A Man (Kill A Man)
That was about the time we was openin' up for Naughty
Didn't know shit, we were jus' tryin' to rock the party

'92 ('92) a year later, 'bout a million records sold
From doin' shows like Lollapalooza on the road
Buildin' up momentum, whilst spittin' deadly venom
Takin' pictures for High Times, me, Muggs and Sen
Chillin' with the Beastie Boys, smokin' lots of weed
But it was time to hit the studio for another LP

'93 ('93) Black Sunday hits, with critical acclaim
Had a monster hit from Insane In The Brain
Topped the charts, held the spot, for six weeks to boot
It was a trip to note, that we was the first ones to do it in rap music
But it was a feat none the less
So we started gettin' paid and I stopped smokin' stress

[Chorus]

'94 ('94) still in the door and we conquered many tours
With Rage Against The Machine, House Of Pain and many more
Was even invited to Woodstock, some niggas from the block
Called up Eric Bobo and half a million rocked
How could all this happen at 24 years of age
Half a million bouncin' to your shit from off the stage

'95 ('95) I was alive and survived so far
Still tryin' to cope with bein' a rap star
'Cause that's the type of shit that can really affect your mental
This was evident, in the way I broke the tempo
With confusin'(I'm havin' Illusions) pain, and hence illusions
But I still kept my set up with the critics bein' abusive (Yeah)
Even the record company, they became illusive
When it comes to showin' support for the Cypress institution

'96 ('96) wit' no support we were still makin' moves
Cypress Hill, in the summer, we were on the Smokin' Grooves
But like every legend every click, someone had to split
So the Dog left the house, shit was gettin' kinda thick
I was with the electric lady, we was talkin' about babies
But the groupies on the road don't help me from misbehavin'

[Chorus]

[B-Real]
'97 ('97) was the trip, it was the year we killed the feud
Between us and Cube, over shit nobody knew
The Dog came back home but after Smokin' Grooves 2
Chillin' with George Clinton and Erykah Badu
This was a crazy time, we were flowin' off the boo
Niggas on stage, trippin' on the 'shrooms

'98 ('98) was kinda great, 'cause it felt just like before
We hit the studio, recorded Cypress Hill IV
But someone dropped the ball, as I still recall
'Cause it felt Cypress Hill got no support at all
We did the last Smokin' Grooves, but did it all with Sen
And the old chemistry, just reared it's head again

'99 ('99) I got to recline, because there was no doubt
That the first year was a success, of the Smoke Out
'99 was even better than the year of '98
And Skull And Bones was comin' out, kickin' from the gate

Two-thousand (Two-thousand) 15 million records sold
They broke the mould, but there's others along the road
But we still keep rollin' on from Heaven to Atlantis
Droppin' shit in English and makin' albums in Spanish

Two-thousand and one (Two-thousand and one) 
Goddamn, who knows what's in store
Just as long as motherfuckers know, who's knockin' on the door
We remain unjaded and still we go unfaded
See how long we made it and never ben outdated

We ain't goin out, motherfucker (That's right, fuck that)
You don't know  
(Ttime Cypress Hill)
(Motherfuckin' renovators up here)

Never fucked like this
But I smoke blunts like this
People ask: Why you pull stunts like this?
Cause I believe in doing what I got' a
A lot' a people don't understand nada
The Mic burns
You was at
It turn's to a slaughter
You wanna think about chilling the fuck out,
You all gonna Top Allah, Pop collar,
Niggas, Latin Thungs
All my family love barillas
Beginners get pushed to back of the pack
Invented and lend out, without not a tech
You're on the top of the game
But you work on a name till one day
To put us in the walk of fame
Don't call a name to recall the fame
Eventually Dru is in the Hall of Fame
You know what the deal is,
You know what the heal is,
You know who the Real is,
You know what my skill is,

[Chorus: B Real and Sen Dog]

[Sen Dog]
I get mental
This ain't no pad and a pencil
Throw the microphone,
My only utensil
I tag the check, like I got nothing to lose (That's right)
I test myself, just to show up and prove
That C-Y-P-R-E-S-S
Got you funky, while I'm real deaf
Put it to the test, and you will confess
Soul Assassins is the best
Check it homeboy, got to spot cracking (cracking)
Six LP, from that ThugDogLatin
Turn the heat up, and keep it hot
Always give ya mo', and then thank
We got to freak the Hip Hop and the hot ride
I'm on to make shows and can't hide
Had first 'self titled', became an Idol
In a Sub town barrio

Cypress Hill,"Low-ri-der, low-ri-der

Coming through fo' real we Cypress Hill, oh baby
Got that crunk, for yo' trunk, going gangsta crazy
We some real life hustlers, playing games in the street
We got that low-ri-der, scraping dipping on three (low-ri-der)
So pop your collar, give a holla, throw yo' dubs in the air
We tear the roof, off the mother, lady let down yo' hair
Player do that thing, that make you feel alright (low-ri-der)
Smoke that tree, crack that brew, we getting freaky tonight

Now when people are done, bumping they head to this
You wonder why you wanted anything instead of this
We been making you bounce, for many years already
Rock steady and cut, many niggas to confetti
But I just want to blaze it up; whether it's the mic or a spliff
Yes my gift is to amaze you all
Thought I couldn't come for ten my friend, but guess what?
I slay niggas and still saving my best nut (low-ri-der)
But you better cover your eyes, cause you never know when
I spit it out and start some flowing
I drop rhymes that grow like trees you're smoking
Ear drums feel like lungs, your brain's choking
Just let it soak in, seep in, creep in
I'm keeping, all you motherfuckers in the deep end (low-ri-der)
You want to trip? Then I got luggage
I stuff you in and send you off, cause you ain't rugged

Low-ri-der, low-ri-der

Cause, we're Cypress Hill, come on and ride with us
Just get inside, we bouncing dipping, chop it up real tough
Lean to the side, pimp yo' hat, tilt yo' seat on back
Don't front on me, baby boy, and break bread with the sack (low-ri-der)

I be the vato with the fine hoodrat in the ranfla
Always roll deep on the streets like the mafia
Pleito, just might come back and haunt ya
Flossing too much, no vato's gonna want ya
Not right here homes, we're past all of that
Making that feria, spitting that raps
Ya me conoces, I'm down for my calle
Cypress Ave, why a pudo les madre
Ya tu sabes, we don't play that shit
Any pendejo's getting hit up quick
Whats up ese? What hood you claim?
Now throw it up and down like it ain't no thang

To all you vatos, make sure you check this
In every barrio, I'm well respected

Cypress Hill,"[B-Real]
I'll admit, I was a wild seed when I was a kid
Slanging dope, poppign Shroomz and dropping lots of sin
Psychedelic visions would ensue
My view feelin the alter-states as they altered my fate
But I ?, all that distorted shit brought it up
I came short and couldn't afford to store it up
So I began to record it on audio
The autobiography of Luis Mario
Something that's unbelievable, inconceivable
That half the shit I set out to do was achievable
But alas, look at all the shit come to pass
While we remained strong, others broke like glass
'cause you lack style, and you need all the help brother
'cause you're fragile, and it should say it on your cover:
This side up, for the celebrity
Who lacks intelligence, integrity, intensity
Oh it's true, I got you in that angle like Kurt
But don't go getting your fucking feelings hurt
I spit many bars of heat, that burn like a furnace, 
I pour rhymes out like coffee spilling out your 'dermis

[Chorus: x2]
I got my 9mm at my waist, papa
I got my shotgun in the escalade, papa
If you feel groggy then jump and get sprayed, papa
I don't want to but you dug your own grave, papa

[B-Real]
You know me and you've grown with me
And if I had a big enough pad, I'd take you all home with me
I don't walk around with bodyguards, that's not me
I'm hangin out with the people as my posse
Used to have a lot of enemies with bad intentions
Spreading gossip like disease, creating lots of tension
People turn around when you become a star it seems
But others hate you all 'cause you've fulfilled all your dreams
They smile in your face and act like nothing's wrong
When you turn your back, they hate, and play one of your songs
Why don't you take your mask off, look me in the eye?
You afraid I might blast-off and call you on your life?
Take a deep one, and peep son
Retribution comes around more than once, like a re-run
You're a cheap one to kill, so steep son
You're just another one who gets thrown in the quay, son

[Chorus]

[B-Real]
You know they smile in your face, 
You know they try to take space
I let you punks know you ain't safe
'cause you know you're just dead-weight
But at the present day they getting stalled out for some 
reason
But not from me, because it's punk-hunt season
Charged with high-treason, I'm easing the blow never
The ? that you're leasing, ain't gonna roll forever
So think about that, is it worth the pain?
When you flirt with pain, bitch you don't hurt your brain
But you're thick-headed, numskull and Rick said it:
It was the moment you feared, when my venom spread

A dog on four paws spittin' out the window
Jump up! It aint no need to fight
We may squeeze the pipe, you gonna bleed tonight
I eat beans and rice, shit up a storm
I walk the streets with shark fin off my arms
Doctor Dolittle, lit off the bone
My bracelet like I raised it off the farm
Home-grown, thick, dirty
My family feud dudes who pack 2's on survey
Jersey and house
Gun like an elephants snout
Pull ya ambulance out
Ya whole team'll get bombarded
Ya on target, and bombed by some unsigned artists
We leave ya hair cut like a blind barber
Cut it, and gave you a line with fine markers
I won't leave till the job is done
Till the last prick nigga take ya wallet, run
Doc with the shotty and we both catch a body with Cypress Hill
Yeah!

So hard, hell I crack the shell on ya candy coatin'
If the shoes fit like Alan I be too thick
Ever since you hit, yo my new chicks a new bitch
Ya know if I can't eat, ya can't sleep
Plus I'm in denial, I just can't admit defeat
My mind is my glock, keep my third eye cocked
Bust mines off tops, leave a rapper's nerves shocked
Now who's hot and who's not
I want them rocks and that money in ya two socks
Meth the mister, if crime is an art, then let me paint a picture
I'm gone, Kodak can't even frame the riddler
Gold realin', Meth, doc, Cypress Hiller
Whoever think they fuckin' with that, lets be realer

Smoke blunts through ya lungs and flips ya brain cells like athletes
Run a track meet, the rhymes on ya rap sheet
With the foot long crush bong, look your collapsing, sicko
They go on the break-off, mental breakdown and shit you wouldn't think of
I spread it to Reggie, chances are better but deadly
You wanna be friendly on the get high Bentley
You twisted up, burnt out within seconds
Cos you couldn't hang with the John Blaze methods
Bong hittin', doc spittin', shark bitten
Star stricken, glock clickin', stop shittin'
Inhale the smoke from the master's lungs
You wanna roll up, yo I'm the fastest one (ha!)
You wanna test with the sess, well first off

I'm close to the best thing on the West Wing
Blown out your set, flames when the best sing

They feel it in they heart: I was there to test things
Didn't arrest aim, the bullet-proof vest came
These niggas shoot first, then askin' check names
It's less strain 
It's all real; I bet fame; it's a chess game
Wrong move and it's checkmate (That's right) 
I might sound funny out here 
But, really, niggas get money out here 
And, hey, everyday is sunny out here
So listen, don't play dummy out here

Like you, signed the deal, or signed over your will
Busters get slayed!

When you fuck around with Real
Take time to feel what I'm tellin' you hos (tellin' you hos)
You couldn't fuck around with me if I was sellin' you blows
Just goes to show the incredible skill tell
Bitch nigga, now you trapped under my wig well
Gettin' trampled, dumped on, and thumped on
Scraped on the six-five with the hand on the pump song

We the vatos that run on Los Angeles
Call me Mad Dog if you think you know me
If you're not sure, then turn around and leave slowly!

Cypress Hill,"So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large, a big house five cars the rent charged
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

I remember the days when I was a young kid
Growin' up, lookin' in the mirror dreamin' about blowin' up
To rock crowds make money chill wit the honies
Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me, shits funny

How impossible cream manifest in the games that be comin' with it
Never the less you gotta go for the gusto
But you don't know about the blood sweat and tears
And losin' some of your peers and losin' some of your self

Music has past gone by hopefully you don't manifest
For the wrong guy Egomaniac, in the Brainiac
Don't know how to act, shits deep
Forty eight tracks studio gangsta mack

Sign a deal emcees wanna make a mill
But never will till he crosses over still
Feelin' no hate but fantasies come wit these
Just to sacrifice the taste of makin' cheese

You wanna be a rap superstar in the biz
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games
But the price of fame is high
And some can't pay to play

Trapped in what you rappin' about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout
The rout you took started collapsing
No fans, no fame, no respect
No change, no women, and everyone shits on your name

So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large, a big house five cars the rent charged
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large, a big house five cars the rent charged
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

When you sign to a record label
You don't know just signed your life over
And these whiteboys don't care about you
'Cause the minute you fall off

They'll find another Noreaga
And they'll find another Capone 'n' Noreaga
And they'll find another B Real
So you need to just keep stack your chips up

Do what you gotta do while you hot?
And mafuckin' get out the game
This isn't the drug game
It's even worse

Because in the drug game
Because if someone jerks you
You can shoot 'em and kill 'em
But in this game if someone jerks you
You gotta be humble

So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large, a big house five cars the rent charged
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large, a big house five cars the rent charged
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

My own son don't know me
Sittin' up in the hotel room lonley
But I thank god I'm wit my homies
But sometimes I wish I was back home

But only no radio or videos
'Cause they show me no love
The phony gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by Sony

I'm in the middle like monie
And the press say that
My own people disowned me
And the best way back

Is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
Your crew worried about them honies at the paladium
Who just wanna cling on swing on

And so on and go on and fall off
The hoes fall off
To the next rap superstar
Wit no shame give him a year

And they'll be right out the game
The same as the last one
Who came before him
Gained fame started gettin' ignored

I warned him, assured him
This ain't easy take it from weezy
Sleezy people wanna be cheesey
They're fuckin' evil

So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large, a big house five cars the rent charged
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large, a big house five cars the rent charged
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

Cypress Hill,"I be that short temper, high style rhyme bringer
Life style got wild, similar to rock singer
Check me on the big screen, livin' out my dream
Cypress, assassin, SX, Latin thug thing

Fools need to get back, I ain't really with that
Flavor of the month, programmers try to dispatch
Always got the good batch, take it to the head
Got you wasted like Jerry from the 'Grateful dead'

Don't trip, get a grip, be strong and don't fake it
Or else you get beat down and stripped butt naked
I just kicked the lyric, straight from the spirit
You can tell I got soul first time that you hear it

Welcome to the show, all come inside
So, you can hear brought my style when it's amplified
You wanna party with the best say, the rest
'Cause we take away your stress and never settle for less

Welcome to the show, all come inside
So, you can hear brought my style when it's amplified
You wanna party with the best say, the rest
'Cause we take away your stress and never settle for less

When you chill with the hill, keep your mouth sealed
If you rely on your skill, then rely on your steal
If you have no ideal or any thoughts to bill
What you sought was real to give 'em slots to fill

Busters stop and yield but I'll daze them
Quicker than takin' a box of pills, now you gots to chill
Get cops and shields, steady, hawk the fields
And they're lookin' for prey, ready to stalk and kill

As I lock the will don't you mock the drill
'Cause I'll cock my steal and make you drop and spill
Got no mercy unless you top the deal
Quit talkin' nil, you won't top my will, bitch

Welcome to the show, all come inside
So, you can hear brought my style when it's amplified
You wanna party with the best say, the rest
'Cause we take away your stress and never settle for less

Welcome to the show, all come inside
So, you can hear brought my style when it's amplified
You wanna party with the best say, the rest
'Cause we take away your stress and never settle for less

Ain't nobody better, on that you can bet
Wanna see a dog show put your money on my set
Real MC's and real DJ's, real Southsiders from the heart of L.A.

Now back in the days we had big success
And it's like that now and we won't settle for less
You can't beat the LP from the new Latin lingo
Nowadays you nothin' without a hit single

Time to get locin', put bodies in motion
Hit the stage in a rage and start up a commotion
No, I ain't jokin', see my mic smokin'
I slam it like the art and make sure it's broken
Broken, broken, broken, broken, broken

Yeah, Cypress Hill, 'Amplified Remix', Fredwreck drop that sh

Welcome to the show, all come inside
So, you can hear brought my style when it's amplified
You wanna party with the best say, the rest

Straight jacket, strap it 
In a padded room when some punk niggaz can't hack it
Distracted from our reality
Now I'm let out on a minor technicality
They all fucked up now 
Cause they let a nigga back on the street somehow
I'm lookin' for someone like me
Livin' in my own world to my own degree
On the loose in the city lookin' at the ho wit the big titties
Lookin' at me and I feel shitty 
A little tensed up gettin' hot
Cause she looks like my girl who just smoked at the crack spot
I'm tryin' to find ways to cope 
But I ain't fuckin' round wit the gauge or a rope

Cypress Hill,"You ready holmie?
Yup.

My first mission runnin' through the head to smoke jack
With memories poppin' in my head recall that

Late night creepin' through the alley with six deuce
Strapped up everybody focused no mixed views

A sawed off pumped in my hand with two shells
The other four holmies on the scene with cocktails
One nigga lookin' for popos and foes hell
Someone lookin' through windows the door bells

Goes off followed by the punk you gas bomb
Adrenaline pumped up still I remain calm

House lit up you could see it for eight blocks
Runnin' through the hood run in front of the fade cops

The game chase but they couldn't cover the streets up
Rolled out ran into the spot to meet up

Strapped down covered up the tracks and back home
Laid low earned me a stripe perfect no

[Chorus]
Shoot 'em up
Bang bang
Another body dropped
You can't stop the head nod
Soot 'em up
Bang bang
Another body dropped
You can't stop the hip-hop
Shoot 'em up
Bang bang
Another body dropped
You can't stop the head nod
Shoot 'em up
Bang bang
Another body dropped
You can't stop the gunshots

Yeah I'll hit your block up better lock up
Fuck the gang and shit don't stop uh

A mad dog with a bob in the reagle
Go into mode and just kill all your people
Coast to coast ain't a nigga more evil
Now made me act a lot and call Sen Diesel

Rock the block with the M one six
.44 mag like a east war fit
This here granadilla break you off right quick
Be prayin' up to Jesus and all that shit

Uh niggas be jackin' when they see my bucket
Roll down they block they hide and say fuck it

Come back in form of an assassin
Three hundred yards with the infrared action

Troop is the layer black Doc Holiday
Cuancho raider the modern day huh

[Chorus]

Yeah, now shooting up your town. Them bad ass assassins, boy. Thought you knew. Check this out, you better be packin', fool. Hyeah.

I manned all missions when I was a youth so thoughtless
G ride no fingerprints it's spotless
Six bows hittin' all the Gs and we got this
Rag top down like a stripper that's topless

See me hittin' the corner you meltdown
Slugs fly thugs die moment ya fell down
Somebody's screamin' you hangin' the hell down
I'm certified nigga when you're sittin' there spellbound
No thoughts barkin' just hearin' the hellhounds
Burn you with the heaters spittin' out twelve rounds

It's life in the hood no escapin' the gunplay
Buy one day I'm out gotta figure out some way
Rats in the park all scatter when guns spray
Got you locked in now where do the slugs stray
I found ways out but the street be one way
Got a dark mind no thoughts blacker than Sunday

[Chorus]",Another Body Drops
Cypress Hill,"[B-Real]
Well here's a little story, I got to tell
About a thugged out homey, I know so well
It started way back, when I was a teen
In the hood, on the corner, slangin dope to fiends
Had the little stash that could serve your need
You can do what you want but I got weed for me
Ridin for my fam, tryin to hit a grand
CRASH unit on my ass, now I'm in demand
One lone-ly fami-ly I be
All in the hood, I got no-bo-dy
The sun is beatin down on my red dark hat
Pigs are roamin through the alley so I gotta toss my gat
Forgot about the sack, lookin for a place to hide
If they ask me for my name - fuck 'em, I'ma lie!""

[Chorus]
One O.G. gangsta I be
Busted in the hood, I got no more weed
Pigs are coming down on my gangsta stash
When they caught me with the weed, and the dope and hash

[B-Real]
He said a little something, I wasn't so impressed
No more running homey, now you're under arrest
The sack was in my hand, felt like a sack of bricks
I swore he couldn't see it when I threw it in my whip
He said he wanted some, I said I don't have none
Found it in the sun on the floor next to my gun
Next thing I saw was the gun to my head
Now the lead will make me dead, and yo this is what he said

[Sen Dog]
My name is Sgt. Slacker with a license to kill (uh-huh)
I think you know what time it is, it's time to get real (yea)
Now what do we have here? A banger and his peers

[B-Real]
He cuffed my hand you understand he threatened me with tears
Sorry motherfucker had his gun out with a grin
You think the story's over but it's ready to begin

[Chorus]

[Sen Dog]
Now I got your crack and most of your crew
You got a couple choices of what you can do
Better make the right decision if you know what I mean
You can do some time, or fork over your green

[B-Real]
I said I got no green he started looking at me harder
I said I don't have nothing you can go fuck your daughter (WHAT?)
He hit me with the fist, he hit me with the gat
He put the night stick to my back, so
I think I'm done, the pig's got my gun
It isn't looking good, I got ink on my thumb
Another pig walked in, said he's playin games
He gave another look at me, found out my false name

[Chorus]

[B-Real]
Sitting there pissed as I dwell in my cell
The place smells like shit, in the County Jail
Homey looking at me like he seen me before
He started throwing up a set, then he spit on the floor
I think ay-yeah yo, I know this kid
It's the same motherfucker cocktailed my crib
This dude said, get ready, pulled a shank on me
I said c'mon homey you a bit too sloppy
Fool tried to stab me, socked him in the eye
The guards yelled, ""Give it up!"" and let two fly
The guards said down and we hit the floor
If you make a move after you won't move no more
He said I think you once again best protect ya neck
I said eat a dick from me you don't get respect
I said you want to come with it, any time and place
And I'll leave you like Pacino with a Scar-on-ya-face
They put him in the hole, and all the bullshit stopped
But when his boy had beef, yeah he got dropped
P.D. had no witness, D.A. dropped the load
I got probation for the gun and the dope, case closed

Fit in ganja weed, always notorious

You want my roll, on someone you hardly know
This Marley grow, no time to move feet

They wanna clout the bus, and on the top be us
They never wanna come around, just a rowdy bunch

Reflections of my own life flash like a fire
Powder burns the memories life seems a bad dream
Fall for cenetries physical and the mental
When I crashed through work

I was cursed but still I
Quit my curse found my hustle
Stack paper made it world wide
Feeling the dream, don't be a hater son

Think you the greater one
Gotta put you on the fader son
Cut your a** up see you later
Gotta drop till your praying n****

You ain't a player hust a frail n****
I'm the slayer in your nightmares
Unstoppable
When you see me on the street

Call a audible
I got you covered, face it
And you can't dodge this bullet baby
This ain't the matrix

Got to put you in your placement
Hide your body in the basement
Your boys wonder where your face went

Ever since my days you rock vest just to push your range
No doubt about it

Peep into the case, see me, ask
Why that black a** n**** flow over the piano
Droppin it good
For that hoody in the front row

that's my good pro down for the juggalo
Three guns busted for the battle man
Shoot the whole scene make the motherf***er rattle

Either man rush I'm gonna hit em with the head rush

I was walking on the block
Heard a couple shots
Caught one in the leg

I love that drama s***
I'm all ga**ed up
I lit that kush up and got doughed up
And thought about all the foul s*** I did

I can't help it, I was this way since a kid
Then I slide out the crib
Hunt down my pray
The look in my eyes like I sniffed some yay

Ran up on homes
And blast away
He pa**ed away twin got the last laugh today

Better have a hustle if you mean to survive
Why you're so greedy, can you tell us all why
Look homie believe me, you're fuckin' metal ply
For the Dollar everybody is a target that's real
Talkin' is smog you're fate's signed and sealed
You could be the next one cross 'em in the path

All the Money that we stole too weak to take greed

No sign of loyalty in anything you speak

We drew lines
But you never understood mine

Just like my momma told me
I held my hood up only
You were a fucking phony
I guess it manifested when I got the call early
They said you bunkered down in the hood with old girly
She had your back covered but that didn't matter did it
I know you're livid but you put your fucking self in it
Don't try to make a move nigga don't go fucking dare
I know you're hurting cause you're tied up to the fucking chair
You never loved your family
You robbed them all gladly
They tried to love you sadly
You let 'em down badly
Just call me death angel
But we were never strangers

Now it's time to pay
Any last word to say?
I know your minds strayed
Son, I think you need to pray
Don't even need to tell you,
You were a smart nigga
Save your teardrops,
Yo don't even start nigga
Ya should of thought a that long ago before ya fucked me
Ya dodged long enough homie now ya been lucky
But now it's pay the piper
No fucking traps or snipers
Just a gas a lighter
Caught up in the web of spiders
And now you get devoured
Burned up in the flames you coward
This is the fairy hour
I sent your family flowers
I'm sure they all will miss you
But they will be good without you
They'll reminisce and light a candle
When they talk about you

Gone where some of y'all niggas, couldn't come back

Came back with a hard shell and hard as nails
I went through it all, do it all, screw it all

Much closer to death, every step I kept on

We so influential
Well strip you of your street credential
Game recognize, game we all about
Think you can diminish mine
Look homey I got a career

[Chorus: x2]

They call me dog homey
Look I don't sell woof tickets
I got my fingers on the trigger
And I'm ready to click it
I never back down
there's nothing you cand do to me nigga
Who the fuck are you
Your face is really new to me nigga
You want to run with the dog
Try paying your dues homes
Bum nigga yelling every time that I use chrome
So many niggas, ain't none of them blast, the right lights
In the woods be stunning their ass
I took a chance
To advance, in my life believe it
It takes a stand to be a man
Plus the gang conceited
Fools trying to be hard
They only act the role
You little sorry ass bitches, Ill smack you hoes
Try to fool people
Make em think you something your not
I'm exposing all you bitches
By provoking the crowd
Raw dogging, dying for some action, drama
Your bitch shocked out
Bullets through plastic dome

[Chorus: x2]",Till Death Comes
Cypress Hill,"How many times have we been through this
I can tell you that it's getting harder every time I try to resist
We go way back and you held me down
Helped my feet moving on the ground
No matter what situation occasion
You were amazing, you knew just what it took to keep dough up blazing 
I kept you by me, but when we separated I was thinkin' foolishly
Remember when your Ex-Boy tried to bug on me
I told to bring it on and I'll buy you a slug on me
He didn't like that but didn't want the fight
Fuck 'im, he didn't know how to treat you right
We go hand in hand they don't understand a man
But you do and I really respect that, damn
We been down so long but it's all good
That's why I dedicate this song

[Chorus]
Till Death Do Us Part
I do
Till Death Do Us Part
I do

Who would have thought it would last so long
So many new ones think that they can't go wrong
I know I make so many mistakes
I know you felt neglected, you caught me outta line
If you thought I didn't respect it, I heard ya
But I never showed an emotion
If I haven't ever said it, you got on my devotion
When I fell hard you picked me up
Maybe think about my life where I'm going a little tricky ? Huh?
I know there were time where you thought I would change
But I'm the same motherfucking brother even in spite of the fame
There might be some times we don't agree on some
But don't never feel your thoughts don't mean nothing
Some have tried to steal you all, I'm not one of those people
Always tell it like it is, 'cause the truth will free you but don't get mad
When truth is leaving I'm only telling you 'cause I got your back

[Chorus]

You got my mind right and I don't know how you did it
When I trip not too many who can put with it
But you still there, still care so well, oh yeah
Got so much love when you need you can go there
I appreciate what you're doing for me
I had to open up my eyes so I can see the minutes we lost
Whenever I was out on tour, I go on, we could make it up like never before
You want all the little things that make it work it
Why not, we can get it, we both deserve it
It's hard but nothing's good, it's ever so easy
We have a bond that won't break, no mistake, believe me
Till Death Do Us Part, like I said from the start
You're the light that guides me through when I'm in the dark
They said we'd never last but we're still strong
That's why I dedicate this song, c'mon

[Chorus: x2]

I met her at the club, her friend liked me but she didn't. 
She noticed a lot of girls giving up their phone digits.
She didn't want to be one of those ho's whose clothes
Exploiting their body's from head to toes. She had glossy lips,
She was swaying her hips on the dance floor and every ni-
Flashing the grips trying to impress her in vain, 
She gave no play, tend to offer numbers and she said no way.
I thought to myself let it go the girl on beat,
But like Smoky said she really had a hold on me. 
I couldn't stop staring I started to fantasize with her. 
Voices in my head said she's tantalizing ya. Even if I 
Moved to the other side of the party I had pictures in my 
Head of her moving that body. I was beside myself with conquer
Pain so I slowly walked over and I asked her name

[Chorus: x2]
What's your name? What's your number?
I would like to get to know you,
Can we have a conversation? 
The night is young, Girl 
Give me a chance

She gave a smile but I got no answer though it took a while 
Before she could gave a chance she sat too cool. I offered her 
A drink she turned me down flat she said ""If you want my name 
You gotta do better than that."" I said, ""Okay, now your shit 
Don't stink, I'ma walk away, only tried to buy you a drink."" 
As I began to walk away she said ""I'm sorry for reals, but every 
Guy in the club tries slipping me pills, I don't trust that each 
And everyone would lie to you"" I said ""I understand but that's 
Not what I tried to do, I wasn't even gonna go to your table but 
If I didn't, I knew that I'd regret it later. I go after what I 
Want but I got class. For me no need to slip a pill if I want."" 
She gave me a funny look, I couldn't tell what it meant. She let
Her guard down and on the conversation went
[Chorus: x2]

Lets go!

She said I want a man with the plan and ambition not an immature,
On a., get mission. I'm too good but that I have so much to offer.
Got a good job, working at my mom and dad's law firm. ""You got 
Goals?"" that's what she asked, ""Yeah, I want to fill my home with 
Platinum plaques. It takes hard work but you know it's coming 
After."" She said ""Oh My God! You must be a famous rapper"". ""I do 
Alright, but I'm never satisfied. I'm told 'when you still love 
What you do it never gets old'. I strive for more but that's enough 
About me. Why don't we skip out the club, take a walk  on the street? 
We slipped outta the club with no worries, seemed she wanted to get 
Out in a hurry. We hung all night, and we lost our friends 'til 
They caught us banging in the back of a Benz.

But don't be fooled
They say it never rains
I can tell you that ain't true
'Cause when you hustle on the streets
So that you can feed your family
Depending on what you hustle
Niggas could just kill a man

The game of life
I'm a full-time player
Never settle for less
I keep searching for what's greater
Inspite of any hater portrayal
I keep it moving
Never fucked anyone over
Because it comes back later

At the dump it's a long fall
When you the bottom
People remember
All the attitudes you shot 'em
The minute you fall
You're as good as forgotten
Thought you had it all
But it all went rotten

But no many times I have failed
I've never let anything get in the way
Of my dreams and hot spells

I stay focused
With my mind on the prize
And if you try to block me
Then we push you aside

(Yeah, that's right yo, hip hop veteran
Gon' tell you that we better than most of these fools out here

It's the Hill, baby
It's the Hill, baby
Easy they go when you got no mo'
Spit it real, baby
Spit it real, baby, come on
Easy they come when they want your soul
This shit is real crazy
This shit is real crazy
Easy they go when yo' shit gets old
This shit is real crazy
The game is so shady lately

This business ain't nothing
But a series of comebacks
Write you off as dead
Til you come back with a bomb track

Man you got to save food
?
Nothin' all over your stuff
That's right
I believe in myself and my talent
Skills have been diminished
Motherfucker, there you have it
You got to learn the game
Master every angle
Like a zen master runnin' the triangle
Just when they think that you're all dried up
Surprised that they asked when the back don't cut
Hip hop icon
I'll tell you what it takes
Patience, persistence, perseverance

Know it in your song
They gon' love it when they hear it

Nobody's taking me out
I'll decide
When I'm outta here

[Chorus]

I got love for every fan
Ever part of the plan
So while you can
Take some pictures
And sign some autographs 

But if you push I put my foot in your ass

Not many in this game would last so long
So they can get what they can
Before the time is done
People are gonna stay with you
But you must never mislead them
But if you treat them wrong
Lead them on
They'll say ""We don't need you""
Then it's back to the streets, to square one
Nigga screaming, ""This ain't fair""
Yeah
But nobody cares
You had the money and the cars
Big house and pearls
Jewels and hot beats
So that you could spit out words

So much time and emotion invested
From being on top
Nigga, can't get arrested
Easy come, easy go
When they forget 
In every regard

Sometimes I think about the only way

You and me little punk ass nigga
Once you down with me you down for life

Don't slip and you could get dropped through the alley
And violated for credit and stuck in your belly
'Cause its all about survival
Better learn it quick or you might get wet on arrival

I got ways of dealin' with my own
A state of smoking for sure
Hot and heavy when I break a nigga
Heat on the street in the form of gang bangers

Hunt your ass down to the graveyard hell

Caught a glimpse of life and say it with me

Reminiscing about the homies awaitin' here
Escape the street karma
No matter what keep comin'
Could never much sleep
You know everything is much harder
We setup and get shot up
You wanna survive you better have the street knowledge

You have fat wallet so
You might have a brave heart like clear Wallace

On the corner
I'll warn ya
Gonna roll on ya

Hit ya with a golden rule
Don't turn your back on the street
When I hit that corner, feel the concrete
If ya push that by like nothin'
Watch me turn to a psycho all of a sudden

I've lost my breath I'm winded

Let the gat hum

Had a bad dream
Woke up in a casket
Now I can't even get back at the bastard
Bull-shit!

Ain't strong enough to contain the Afro Marx
Critical bell rings
Snapped out the dream
What the fuck's up with the funny red beam
Pointin' at me
I got no strap G
What now: gotta duck, they're gonna gatt me
Bam, I feel numb

Comes very handy when it comes to pushin', shovin' and stuff
Then ask who is he though, I'm not a sissy
I'm stiff the neutral brother, and I'm born to get busy

Cypress Hill,"On a chicken-hunt, huntin' for a chicken 
Get paranoid when you hear my Glock clickin' 
Speakin' to the punk that's tweakin' 
With the bitch-ass styles I hit you like Deacon 
Jones house, cough without the bones 
I rolled ya up and smoked you like cones 
Split the seed and grow you like clones 
Don't start-me-up, cause I'm not the Rolling Stones 
But I get stoned with a little help from my friends 
With the (gubla), then I passed it round back to me again 
I can make you famous like Amos 
Same as the last punk, when I stuck the gatt up his anus 
Hear me growl, howl! 
I got the night vision just like the wise old owl 
I'm comin' ta fetch ya 
Yeah home direct ya 
Bury them bones 
Under my home and

Cock the hammer, it's time for action!

Take my weapon, step into a whole new realm 
And step back, as I take up the helm 
On the pirate ship I'm steerin' 
Droppin' the geran 
Just realize what you're hearin' 
The cannon sounded 
That's my companion: surrounded 
As my crew comes bounding 
As the captain 
Afro-america 
Whole lotta gattin' 
With the loc'ed out latin 
Busted! 

You're a red beard with a musket 
Better talk quick 'cause ya might get dusted 
Your gatt looks rusted, disgusted 
Oh look away, look away boy as I rush it 
Yes I know that you can't withstand it 
Watch that ass cause punk I'll brand it 
With a steel-toe, how you feel now 
When my boot stuck in that ass like a dildo 
Cry on a pillow, weeper that's willow 
The Hill got the skill for the static like brillo 
Hmmm, what you talkin' 'bout punk 
Gimme room as I light up the boom 
Cock the hammer, wave the white banner 
Ever heard a Glock go 'click' like a camera?

Thinkin' like a peace smoke, comin' on a homicide
You talkin' shit, tryna take me for a ride
I'm not a bad guy, but I'm the funky feel
Finger on the trigger with my hands upon the steel
Lettin' out a bullet, this is goin' boo-ya
You're stuck in my hood, so what ya gonna do now?

Better run more, and move a little faster

Cuz I'm the chill one, known to get ill one
They stepped to the Hill ""What's up?"", I had to kill one
Now I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And they got me on lock down
Headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And they got me on lock down
Living like a nigga who done lost his mind
Cause I ain't goin out like a spineless jellyfish
Some say life is a bitch
Ask that punk who dug his own ditch
Out for the Hill fuckin up at a party
Tried to get funny, put a hole in his body

Put the blunt down just for a second
Don't get me wrong it's not a new method
Inhale, exhale
Just got a ounce in the mail
I like a blunt or a big fat cone
But my double barrel bong is gettin' me stoned
I'm skill it, there's water inside don't spill it
It smells like shit on the carpet
Still it, goes down smooth when I get a clean hit

And then take that finger off of that hole
Plug it, unplug it
Don't strain, I love you Mary Jane
She never complains, when I hit Mary
With that flame, I light up the cherry
She's so good to me, when I pack a fresh bowl I clean the screen
Don't get me stirred up the smoke, through the bub-bling water
Is makin' it pure so I got ta', take my hit and hold it
Just like chong, I hit the bowl and I reload it

Me and you, bruca, we should be humping
If honey likes the mack, homey's got her in the bag
But there's vato's rolling out, and they're sticking up the flag
He jumps out with the sag, ""hey where ya from homes?""
It's on, he sees him reaching for his chrome
Buckshot to the dome, jumps in the Brome
Honey's in the back but she just wants to go home
But he trips to the store homeboy needs a forty
White boy at the counter's thinking oh lordy lordy!
Pushing on the button, panicking for nothing
Pigs on the way, ayyo I smells bacon
Dips out the store, one-time hits the corner
And he hits the fucking alley like if homes was Pop Warner
Still had the forty, coming out the alley
Seen the chief's son, pig Officer O'Malley, oink
In the black and white thinking he's gonna check him right
Wrong, haha, it's gonna be on

What's the commotion, yo I'm not joking around

Hug my kids, tell em I love em, my mouth, hit the fried
I'm out on patrol, in my squad car, do I lay
Where you never know, if you'll be makin it home today
So many different attitudes, that I come across
I'm hard to console tonight, feeling nobody's lost
Hookers hustlers killers and thieves, out on the streets
Got my mind warped, just found another corpse on the beat
Bound gagged raped, I'm frustrated, I hate it
Found a woman in the dumpster, body was mutilated
Bad dreams all up in my head, no lie
Sometimes I gotta take a sniff so I can get by, why
Don't I get hurt, cause there go my nerves, I got the urge
To merge this bullet in my brain, relieve my pain
What a fuckin shame, I don't wanna live, I paint the wall
With the bloodstains, eye of the pig, I see it all

The eye of the pig

DJ Muggs cuts and scratches'This pig' from Pigs

I've been on the force, over twenty years, I can say
That I'm worse, than some of these motherfuckers I put away
I'm in the biggest gang you ever saw, above the law
Lookin through the eye of the pig, I see it all
Drug abusers, drug dealers and the gang-bangin
Pieces of shit who should be on the fuckin news hangin
These days you can't tell who's-who in the world
Is that a whore, or is that, an innocent young girl?
Fuck, I need a drink, and I'm almost off
At the precinct, it's like an AA meeting all gone wrong
I.A. got an eye, on my close friend guy
For takin a supply from evidence from a bust on a buy
That doesn't concern me, we never rat on each other
We went through the academy, just like frat brothers
Midnight, I only have an hour left on my shift
Think I'll get my dick sucked by this basshead bitch
My marriage is all sucked, my wife is with the neighbors
Subpeonaed, now I gotta sign these fuckin divorce papers
I recall, happier times, before the fall
Look into the eye of the pig, I see it all

Now I'm on my way, back to the station to check out
So I can go home, relax, take a drink and think about
My abrupt change, out of the clean, to the corrupt
Look into the eye of the pig, I'm all fucked
No longer can I determine, who's the criminal
From the innocent man down, to the pedophile
No one gives a fuck about me, I'm slippin
Into darkness, I'm comin to grips and feelin heartless
Watch this, a dark green truck, tinted windows
Duly modified, probably a dope dealer inside
""Pull it over to the curb, take your keys out ""
And raise your hands out the window and get em in high position
Don't move, or I'm gonna blast your fuckin head off
Just tell me where the guns and dope are and you'll get off
Don't give me that bullshit, I've heard about your raps
All you talkin about is slangin and shootin off the scraps
OK, Mr. Freeload, get the fuck out of the truck
I love it how all you fuckin rappers think it's so funny
Hit the fuckin' floor, I need no probable cause
You got a big sack of coke in your truck (what?) so take a pause
You find it funny? Get that smile off your face

Tremendos  cocos why tambien ella es linda
A veces me la cojo en la cocina
Esta muchacha me chupa la pinga
Yo le dije dame tu bollo
Me dice negro loco tu no eres mi novio
A mi me importa un carajo
A mi cuarto meterte un palo
Por tu culo o por tu chocha
why ya tu sabes que no me importa
why ella me dice suavesito
Yo pienso que tu eres bien rico
Cuando me toca por mi frente
Ya tu me tienes bien caliente
why cuando me tocas por detras
Ya tu sabes sin parar
Acabe de singar why me levante
Fui al bano why me ban~e
Sali del cuarto why me esperaba
Con los ojos negros why bonita cara
Pongo mi camisa why mi pantalon
Se ria why me dice, ""Negro sendenton""

Estaba fina
Esta muchacha estaba tan pinga
Hay! cuando se lo meti

Ay Caribe tierra de mi gente hermosa

Cielo Sol, me acompanan donde quiera
Hermanito la lucha recien empieza
(Es mala por la gana)
Yo naci con sangre taina, yo naci

Came out the gutter man
Southern land
Didn't have an upper hand
Never had another plan
I'm different to the mother land
Some will get a summer tan
It's hotter than a summer jam
Live for today
Cause you'll never gettin' another chance
I ain't trippin' off the he say and she say
Cause we say fuck
And pass me a cuba libre
That's what we want
Don't front
I could see ya but
You don't want to see the cold heap up front
How we blow it up
We came to blow it up, hit the spot
So we're done
Representin' in, blowin' up
That's how we show the love
That's how we pass up all this shit that
We know gon' come
It's like the soldier's run is done when the wars won

From cali to the crib, crib
Me in miami
Thank god I'm doin music

About my cash flow
Let me take this shit
And send this letter off to Castro
Ha, ha, ha Dale, come mierda.

Always comin up with something clever
A costa lostra

Call me Sammy
Wild child from the isles
I can go forever like an old fashioned country mouse
Stilo be guajiro
Latino is the lingo
I'm straight cuban-ichi
I bang Pina del Rio

I'm ready to run
Steady we get though, under the sun
About to let go
Show me respect though
Uno memento

Like the cream in your coffee, burning hot
Climbing the billboards for the number one spot
King or the block, stop for a second to watch
Look and learn and loose your top
No more bottles to drop
We still rolling
Pocket's swollen
We're locked and loaded
And the scene exploded
And we're solid as ever on any endeavor
Cypress Hill forever doesn't get any better
We came and saw and conquered it all
We're hungry for more like the kids in Darfur

And you've been recruited
I'm the general that your boy saluted
Give you a minute to see how we do it
You've never seen such finesse 'cause you're so polluted
I'm the king in this area hombre
Knocked em out the park when I'm standing on home plate
(Come on)
So many years of blood sweat and tears
Without me the dogs stay switching the gears
I'm still the same man from back in the day
And I'm still getting luck from Africa to L.A.
Tape one hit play
Burst started to sway
Every time I leave the city fools want me to say
'Cause they stay loyal so it's harder to go
And like the lights I got's to grow
That means I'll roll but I'll return later
Give props to my and buckshot's to haters

Just as you caught in the rapture
All I hear is laughter
In a year's time some of you punks won't matter
Let's see if you can hang if you can climb the ladder
You're not a rapper you're a fucking joke
A one-track hack on a track get your pass revoked
I got keys to the city and we locking you out
Come hard for the paint and I'm blocking you out
So run for the hills and hide in the can
Just put the mic down 
And be that fan
With your petty hands outside the lobby
I'm a pro get my signature

You know the first time I fuckin' blazed up, eh
I was listenin' to those vatos Cypress Hill
You ever heard of them, homes?

Yeah, I heard of them
They fuckin' suck

Are you fuckin' stupid, eh?
What the fuck are you talking about?
Those vatos are firrme, homes
You're a fuckin' hater, eh
Those vatos will shoot you, homes

Whatever

This is for all those haters and imitators
Take your medicine; you won't like the flavor
The taste ain't sweet; we lace that beat
Never forget how we play in the street
Never forget what you say in the street
If you talk too loud, get laid with the heat
We want that cake and, Jay, you can't stop us
Out the gate we take those dollars
Get a crew while we doin' some real shit
Me and the Dog steady pushin' the Hill shit
We flip scripts like doughboys flip bricks
Get money like lottery quick picks
We sick wit' it and, homey, I'm quick-witted
Still in the game, insane, we still spit it
Top level, livin' like a rebel
Settle down, bitch, or we spit that metal

Remember when you motherfuckers
Tried to take what's mine
Niggas left me for dead
But I'll never forget it

(Bang, bang)

I came up in the game, do my thing for the paper
Never gonna change, biggie-bang on them haters
They used to gang bang on a (?)
Dropped Insane; now the world's (?)
I remember when you niggas used to front on me
Everywhere I'd ride, I kept a gun on me
I only used to listen to my one ol' G
He said get money, but stay low-key
So it's the payback 'cause I pay it in the back
Whole world get high when I say it on a track
And I stay wit' a gat; I'm never gonna slip
Quick to hit him up if you ever wanna trip
All it takes is a hit and you never gon' forget
When you smoke on the Hill with the kill that we twist
Fuck a shot--we drinkin' a whole fifth
And I ride 'em (?); you know we gon' miss

[Chorus]",Bang Bang
Cypress Hill,"I was an outcast, outsider
Trouble-maker
A lost soul, outta control
In danger
Didn't have a care in the world
My feelings were numb
Never showing emotion
Is easy for some
I don't know how it happened
How I got to this point
But I needed a way out
I was stuck in a ploy
I needed another path or I'd self destruct
I was down on my luck
My head was so fucked
A menace rollin' the streets is what I was
Holdin' my heat and rollin' with the serious thugs
You couldn't tell me a thing
I was like my brother
Words went in one ear and out the other
Slangin' and bangin'
With a chip on my shoulder
An insane, hit the brain
Certified street soldier
So close to the grave
You at an early age
Can't tell you the price I've paid

[Chorus]
Oh, the sky overhead
Is like a canvas of gray
I dunno how much time
I'm beginnin' to save
From the first spring to light
To the end of the day
I'm just livin' my life
Till they come carry me away

I've been there in LA nights
In the block where I came up
My pops used to hate
When we hanged with them bangers
Guess he knew one day that we'll become us
That's just how it is when you live where we come from
Fight, don't run
Is the motto we live by
Get 'em on the ground
And stomp a mind about ten times
Sure we was just kids back then
I had no remorse for what we did back then
Six of us, one call, we'd all pack in
Hit the strip, and go and get the shit crackin'
Gun wars, and drug deals, I seen 'em happen
When I started losin' homeboys I wasn't laughin'
I looked all around and seen
None of 'em there
That's when I figured out
That nobody cared
If we lived or die
We'll just get high and ride
And I wasn't gonna let this happen one more time

[Chorus]

My mother would stand for me
Every step of the way
She did not judge me
She told me I'd win some day
When I was at my lowest
When I had no focus
She pulled me out the gutter
Said I wasn't hopeless
Every night she prayed for me
I was out on the street
Chillin' on the corner with the hand on my heat
Eyes open wide for the pigs and foes
It's an every day hazard when you hustle for doe
So many nights I didn't come home
She thought the worst
Maybe somebody shot me down
Without any remorse
Maybe I hurt somebody and I was stuck in a cell
Well, I regret all those times that I put her through hell
When I reflect back on those days, my heart aches
And everybody I lost or let down
I wish I could take it all back
And make it better, but I can't
So I try to make amends
And be there, through thick and thin

Come carry me away
Come carry me away
Come carry me away
Come carry me away",Carry Me Away
Cypress Hill,"Who wants the wrath, it must be the hood
Who's up to no good, and wishes a man would
Come up and give him a reason to blast on
I wouldn't put it past him!
He's got juice, how long will it last him?
He's gettin' back, at, all the punks that harassed him
Ask him (hey!) what's ya main hobby?
He'll say there ain't, nothin' like the motherfuckin' robbery
So don't crowd me, cause yo I run shit
You know, homey that old top gun shit
I got a slug comin' straight out the barrel
For your ass, if you wanna ask a dumb question
Cause I'm quick on the draw, click-click, punks drop
Now your life's ain't worth shit!

No letters of death, no threats, will I send
So I'm puttin' an end, to all your dumb shit
(dumb shit) dumb shit, that, ""Homes WHERE YOU FROM?"" shit
Cause I run shit, my way, all day, I don't play
Cause it won't pay
Niggas wanna play with the pistol, you
Make me get pissed though
(You get a fistful!)
Make you eat knuckles, feel your knees buckle
Still feelin' great when you're sleepin' on the pavement?
Save it! The beat down, who gave it?
Sen did, no one will explain it

I've had it up to here, with all the bullshit
Finger's on the trigger, and I'm about to pull it
Gank hardrock, up the block, you know I rule it
To the punks around the corner
Someone's gonna catch a bullet
To the crew, that wants, to get with my program
I'm out to get mine, and ain't takin' shit from no man
In the neighborhood, cause there ain't no brotherhood
In other words, good, if you heard, that we're comin' up
We're out to make a quick buck, that's what I'm thinkin'
And I'm smokin' any punk who even thinks of finkin'

Some of you know the struggle, some of you live in a bubble
Some of you hustle and some of you just lookin' for trouble
I don't follow a lead, tomorrow's a dream
Pray to God to intervene on all the sorrow I've seen
You want out of here? You can leave when you wanna
Nothing can stop you if that's your type of persona

Check this out
I got the best kush ever, man
Aw, man
I've been so out
You got sent from heaven
All right, man, light it up, homes
Okay, check it out, man

I'm the original Dr. Green-thumb; the rest are liars
I'm the one with the prescription to get you higher
I got every type of weed that you might desire
Go ahead, fire it up; maybe you can get inspired
Any kind of flavor you savor, I can do you the favor
Just as long as you share with your neighbor
Some like the Sour Deep; that's an East Coast way
But on the West Coast we all know kush is queen
Some of y'all will smoke anything, but me, I'm picky
I throw it out if I don't see that it's green and sticky
No stress, no bush, I'm pushing the kush
When I harvest, put a K on the bag like the Nike swoosh
All over the world, in case you wonder
I smoked everywhere I went; they call me the weed hunter
But no one does it better like we do in Cali
Just ask one of my patients 'cause they always tell me that the

The better I feel; I can't quit

Kottonmouth Kings are down with us
Snoop Dogg and Dre are down with us
Cheech and Chong--they're down with us
But the DEA--they can get the nuts
On the Hard Times cover, you might see us
Taking hits from the bong with the Aprons on
With weed so strong, that knockout King Kong
Hit it one good time, your mind's gone
Your eyes get red and your mouth goes dry
Just get me when you want more and I'll supply
Red and Meth said let's get stoned; I said how high
They said high enough to touch God and kiss the sky
That's a tall order, but I think I got what you need
I got the food-for-thought and I'm ready to feed
So, follow my lead; I got the gifts to bring
It's an everyday life for the reefer king

[Chorus]

I got the cream of the crop; my crop means cream
When it's time to bag it up I assemble the team
Like the Yankees, most winning, grand champs of the herb
Nothing gets you like the type of medicine I serve
Lawyers, teachers, actors, street cleaners
No matter what they are, they all come to see the reefer
They stay high 24 like Kiefer
I tell 'em don't hit it too hard; this is a creepa
Woody Harrelson is down with us
Bruce Willis smoke hard; he's down with us
Yeah, Willie Nelson is down with us
Who the fuck you think drives the ganja bus?
Dionne Warwick she's down with us
She got popped at the airport with joints and such
So if anyone asks, she's down with us
And you don't wanna anymore weed in the cannabis cup
I'm Green-thumb; I reign supreme, son
A strain better than mine--I've never seen one
The K-U-S-H keeps us so high that you can't concentrate
Dave Chapelle is down with us
Halle Barry, too, but don't tell no one

Is far roaming in the streets of greed
Everywhere I turn I'm on a mission for more
But I ain't selling my soul
With the dope there's no girl
I'm on a one way box to the top 
I'm hitting the strip but got a sound that would rally the block 
I'm in the fast lane and I won't stop
You ain't nothing but talk
You couldn't hang on the rope by ball
This life that I live
It ain't for the weak
Got my roddy gangster that came off the street
I'm trying to keep the peace 
But I gotta keep my pace
Got these drunk police
Want me all rappy
And I'm searching for the higher ground
I want my head in the sky 
So high that I cant come down
Leave your lies in every town across the nation

With stick in the prime
I get high from the brim in the set
Never gripping the square
But all you haters couldn't hold my.

Don't need a clip for my ? straight
You should leave it alone
And check your toe cause my line will spit
This right here's as high as it gets
Somebody likes it, the hell
'Cause you stepped on the sex
But guess who will show you, you gotta pass the check
Got my clock on deck and my custom vest streets
You came, for me I'm the best
And you can keep the dress
'Cause I'm smoke at the less
Turn a step back I'm tired of getting pushed

Go with the will to hustle, you see if we hit the floor 
You'll never stop it you ain't got the muscle

Many faces, many places, that I found friend's traces
Where I spend time, places where my mind roam
Places I can call home, places I can get stoned

People wanna knock me down, 'cuz they never have their own
They won't get the best of me, but they try hopelessly
Why you wanna fuck wit' me? I'm not, what you s'posed to be

You did not give a damn, coulda just killed a man
Sawed off in my hand, but I had to kill the plan
Think I've found my piece of mind, feet planted on the ground
I just had to redefine, what I thought to myself

It all goes around me, and others who would down me
Who I don't give a fuck about, trouble always found me
I know I used to welcome it, with my arms open wide

That nobody get tired when it's time to burn
With so many phonies out there, a lot of you have been fooled
Into actually believin', that some shit is cool

Cypress Hill,"I'm at a strange point of my life, my spirit ignites,
I'm destined for heights, I'm so solid with the quest of the life,
I'm under pressure but the time is right,
For me to look inside of myself, the time passes by every night,
I'm searching for answers meanwhile my faith does surprise,
And my neighbours are looking at me with hate in their eyes,
Quad and tea, the streets filled with death and lies,
Was set up to die but we plant seeds to rise,
So when day comes pray so a miracle will keep it protected,
Some of us gotta go but you know it you expect it,
I gotta believe, in more than I see,in something better than this, whatever it is,
I need a quate before my feeling is gone,
Maybe my feeling is wrong
But ill embrace it like a beautiful song,
I feel something strong coming along,
I cant explain what it is, but I'm relaxed till my mind is gone.

Day destroys the night,
Night divides the day,
Reaper's hold is tight,
Lord take my pain away.

This feeling is hitting me hard, my soul is scarred,
The feeling is saw like I'm getting a message from god,
Believin' in cause, no one believes in the laws,
The reason the strong breaks - a soul is lost,
I'm searching for my soul in a myst of boldest insanity,
I'd vanity my home is a warzone calamity, randomly,
Tragedies happen I'm sick of this life,
I'd give in a minute the Vicapri is from stripe,
Gotta bond with the new brothers, leditucci and
Cheddars survival of our mothers would be proud of us,
When the day comes and we rise the high of our faith,
And nothing can touch us, we don't the feel the mothers,
Now the bees inside of my head, the life that I lead,
Left me for dead and lost on the path that I tread,
I blade so many to rest, from family to friends
We pretend it doesn't happen, but when will it end?

Day destroys the night,
Night divides the day,
Reaper's hold is tight,
Lord take my pain away.

I gotta new thought in my mind, in a matter of time,
Ill be in a sublime state of the spiritual kind,
My family is holding me high, they're nervous inside,
I can see in their eyes pride but the eyes don't lie,
If the celebration continues Ill follow my heart,
And my home is being infected from the poisonous dart.
Its fallin' apart, I don't wanna see its demise.
So I'ma have to make a difference to remember I tried,
My brother and sister smiling as I leave in the night,
My mother kisses me on the cheek and my father is quiet,
No words need to be said as my patters begun, cause
Nothing can break the chain of a father and son,
As I take a step in the street where my destiny lies,
Tryin' to focus, my nerves got my stomach in ties,
Rollin in a club god damn these people are young,
But needs to be done so Ill reach you over the hoe.

Day destroys the night,
Night divides the day,

Cypress Hill,"Shots go off
In the next the way you go
The shots go off
Like you demons

Strapped up, but I got back off for
Anything that drama brings

All about a nightmare no more dreaming
Fight your demons
