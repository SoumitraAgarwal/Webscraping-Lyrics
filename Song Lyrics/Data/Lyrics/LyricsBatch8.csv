Chad & Jeremy,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You
Chad Allan,"Baby, baby, can't you see what you're doing to me?
I couldn't sleep a wink last night just a-thinking of you
Baby things weren't right I kept on tossin' and turnin'
Turnin' and tossin'  tossin' and turnin' all night
I threw the blankets on the floor, turned my pillow upside down
Then I thought of you some more
And I kept on tossin' and turnin' turnin' and tossin' 
Tossin' and turnin' all night
Jumped out of bed, turned on the light
Pulled down the shade went to the kitchen for a bite
Pulled up the shade, turned off the light
I jumped back into bed it was the middle of the night
The clock downstairs was striking four, couldn't get you off my mind
Heard the milkman at the door but I was tossin' and turnin'",Tossin' and Turnin'
Chad Brock,"Thought I was awful tough
Been knocked down in the dust
A few more times than I would care to say
Then you came blowin' in
Like that old Texas wind
And girl, you blew my heart away

Oh, I've tamed wild horses
Rode the meanest bulls
Broke a few bones
And kept my cool
Baby, I've been thrown
A time or two
And I thought I'd fallen hard
'Til I fell for you

I know it's dangerous
To take a chance on love
That's why I never dared to get too close
Then deep inside my heart
You had to go and start
A feeling I just can't control

Oh, I've tamed wild horses
Rode the meanest bulls
Broke a few bones
And kept my cool
Baby, I've been thrown
A time or two
And I thought I'd fallen hard
'Til I fell for you

The way you look at me
Makes this cowboy weak
I'd try to walk away
But I ain't got the strength

Oh, I've tamed wild horses
Rode the meanest bulls
Broke a few bones
And kept my cool
Baby, I've been thrown
A time or two
And I thought I'd fallen hard
'Til I fell for you
And I thought I'd fallen hard
'Til I fell for you
'Til I fell for you",'Til I Fell for You
Chad Brock,"He's got her number written on the palm of his hand
His best friend got the number from her best friend
His heart starts racin' when he hears the dial tone
He never dreamed she'd be waiting by the phone
When she answered it felt so right
They talked all night

Bingo bull's-eye
Dead-on the very first try
When it's the right girl, the right guy
Bingo bull's-eye

Everywhere they go they're together now
There's talk, they're talkin' 'bout forever now
What are the chances what are the odds
They'd get it right, right from the start
Only heaven knows how the story's gonna end
But every now and then

Bingo bull's-eye
Dead-on the very first try
When it's the right girl, the right guy

Who'd have ever dreamed it
And who'd have ever thought it
Love's a shootin' star
And they caught it

Chad Brock,"She's been here working all summer long
Pumpin' gas for the boats on the cote blanche
She's so brown, from being in the sun all day
The boys from town, hang around her pa-paw's place
And they all say

Hey you can see her down at the boat dock
Walking up the pier in her flip-flops
Tying up the lines in her tank top
Dipping out the bait at the bait shop
Every boy around would love to say, ""That girl's mine""
Summer's gonna end I know
Oh, we gonna miss you so
Wish you didn't have to go, Evangeline

Won't be long, she'll be going back to school
Going home, all the way to Baton Rouge
Her pa-paw says he'll get along the best he can
And all the boys will be so brokenhearted then
'Til it's summer again

Then you can see her down at the boat dock
Walking up the pier in her flip-flops
Tying up the lines in her tank top
Dipping out the bait at the bait shop
Every boy around would love to say, ""That girl's mine""
Summer's gonna end I know
Oh, we gonna miss you so
Wish you didn't have to go, Evangeline

Chad Brock,"I don't know exactly what this is that I'm going through
I know it seems like I'm somewhere else
When I'm talk to you
I know what I'd be thinking if it was you acting like this
Girl, you gotta trust me when I tell you
That ain't what it is

I'm still standing where I always stood
Right here beside you like I told you I would
I'm here forever, if it's the last thing I do
Baby, I'm in for better or worse
Even if it's hard, even if it hurts
I'm going the distance and baby, I'm going with you

Maybe it's that mountain of bills on the cedar chest
Maybe it's my boss man, maybe it's the IRS
I don't know what it is, don't know how long it might last
But I know it ain't nothing our love ain't gonna get me past

I'm still standing where I always stood
Right here beside you like I told you I would
I'm here forever, if it's the last thing I do
Baby, I'm in for better or worse
Even if it's hard, even if it hurts
I'm going the distance and baby, I'm going with you

Well I'm still standing where I always stood
Right here beside you like I told you I would
Well I'm here forever, if it's the last thing I do
And baby, I'm in for better or worse

Chad Brock,"Summer's gone, there's a cold chill in the air
But I know, it comes around again next year
The songbirds have all flown south
All I hear is the sound of silence in this house

Her laughter is being heard by someone else
And the good times all went with her when she left
Only the memories have survived
I wonder where love goes when it dies

Is there a place in heaven
For love that's gone to hell
Does it turn to dust, just like us
And live again somewhere else
Oh, there's no doubt spring will bring new life
I wonder where love goes when it dies

Is there a place in heaven
For love that's gone to hell
Does it turn to dust, just like us
And live again somewhere else
Oh, there's no doubt spring will bring new life
I wonder where love goes when it dies, when it dies",I Wonder Where Love Goes
Chad Brock,"Can't stand to see you like this
All this confusion gets to both of us
You're goin' back and forth
And what are you waiting for, you know it's love

Just let your heart decide what's right for you
But in my heart I know what I would do

If it were up to me I'd give you everything
My life, my heart, my soul
Just so you would always know that
I'd be devoted to buildin' my world around you
I'd love you endlessly, if it were up to me

Girl, when you look at me
How can you help but see that I am yours
It's there as plain as day
Why are you so afraid
When I'm so sure

Where I see windows, baby, you see walls
You want a guarantee and I want it all

If it were up to me I'd give you everything
My life, my heart, my soul
Just so you would always know that
I'd be devoted to buildin' my world around you
I'd love you endlessly, if it were up to me

If it were up to me I'd give you everything
My life, my heart, my soul
Just so you would always know that
I'd be devoted to buildin' my world around you
I'd love you endlessly
Yeah, yeah if it were up to me I'd give you everything
My life, my heart, my soul
Just so you would always know that
I'd be devoted to buildin' my world around you
I'd love you endlessly, if it were up to me

Chad Brock,"Shelly's at the kitchen table, cup of coffee the morning paper
When he walks in she's so surprised to see the tears in his eyes
He says, ""I love you, I'm so sorry, but bigger dreams are waiting for me
But I can't do this anymore

Pay the bills, watch TV, day in, day out the same routine
Mow the grass, fix the leak, just to fix it again
We go to church, go to work, so picture perfect that it hurts
I feel like I'm trapped inside this ordinary life""

Shelly's at the kitchen table, crayons, construction paper
""Hey Mom, look what I drew, it's a picture of me and you""
And later when he says his prayers, she runs her fingers through his hair
So thankful for every day

They pay their bills, watch TV, day in, day out, it's all they need
Mow the grass, fix the leak, just to fix it again
They go to church, go to school, everyday it's something new
Precious are the days as they go by in their ordinary life

Phone rings, he's calling from the airport
It's midnight, he's all alone again
He says, ""I can't believe how much I've missed
And what I wouldn't give

To pay the bills, watch TV, day in, day out the same routine
Mow the grass, fix the leak, just to fix it again
Go to church, go to work, I can't tell you how this hurts
I miss my son, I miss my wife and my ordinary life""",Ordinary Life
Chad Brock,"I can't believe that we thought we were through
We said some things and acted like a couple of fools
Let's rekindle the fire while there's still a spark
Let me uncry your tears and you unbreak my heart

I saw you last night with somebody new
I know that you saw me with somebody too
You know neither one of us is happy where we are
Let me uncry your tears and you unbreak my heart

We'll undo all of the damage we have done
Back up and get back to square number one
We need to be together 'cause we're no good apart
Let me uncry your tears and you unbreak my heart

I'll take back, ""I'm leaving"" and ""I don't love you""
And you'll take back, ""It's over"" and ""Honey, we're through""
We'll both say we're sorry and make a brand new start
Let me uncry your tears and you unbreak my heart

We'll undo all of the damage we have done
Back up and get back to square number one
We need to be together 'cause we're no good apart
Let me uncry your tears and you unbreak my heart
Let me uncry your tears and you unbreak my heart

",Un-Break My Heart
Chad Brock,"There's no magic between you and me
I said good friends is all we'll ever be
No more, no less
But now I have to confess

You made a liar out of me
I'm saying things I said I'd never say
I swore no one could make me feel this way
Now everyone can see
You made a liar out of me
I've got this feeling that I can't deny
The truth is showing, look into my eyes
You started a fire
You made a liar out of me

I kept my distance even when we touched
Not even you could make me fall in love
No way, no how
But take a look at me now

You made a liar out of me
And I'm saying things I said I'd never say
I swore no one could make me feel this way
Now everyone can see
You made a liar out of me
Over and over and over again
You made a liar out of me

You made a liar out of me
I've got this feeling that I can't deny
The truth is showing, look into my eyes
You started a fire
You made a liar out of me
Girl, you started a fire
You made a liar out of me",You Made a Liar Out of Me
Chad Brock,"He sat down next to the window
By the TV at my bar
He ordered Coke and whiskey
And put something in my jar
And old black and white photograph
He hung onto all his life
And his story broke my heart
He said, ""She was gonna be my wife""

He said, ""Hey mister, please take this picture
'Cause I don't want to miss her anymore
Though the corners are tattered and torn
She's still the one that I adore
Mister, please take this
'Cause I don't want to miss her anymore""

He told me how they met
How at first sight they fell in love
He didn't have to say what happened
The picture told me what it was
Her words in blue there on the back
Had all but been erased
By years of tears and promises
Love lost  but not replaced

He said, ""Hey mister, please take this picture
'Cause I don't want to miss her anymore
Though the corners are tattered and torn
She's still the one that I adore
Mister, please take this
'Cause I don't want to miss her anymore""

I put his picture in a drawer
With all the other ones like her
I get a different one every now and then
And I hear the same old words

Hey mister, please take this picture
'Cause I don't want to miss her anymore",Hey Mister
Chad Brock,"You've got it made, you've got real love
Something you don't find every day
Someone to trust, someone to lean on
Something I would hold on to, if I were you

You've got it made, you've got no one
You don't have those strings to tie you down
You come and go as free as the wind blows
I wouldn't settle down too soon, if I were you

If I were you, I'd be satisfied (I'd be satisfied)
Oh, I'm sure the grass is greener on the other side
If I were you, I'd stay by her side (I'd be running wild)
I would never leave her
That's what I would do
If I were you

Oh, if I were you, I'd be satisfied (I'd be running wild)
Oh, I'm sure the grass is greener on the other side

If I were you",If I Were You
Chad Brock,"In the birth announcements on the fourteenth page
Of the small-town daily news
It read Lilah Thompson had a baby boy
Six pounds at 10:02

But they didn't list the father
He was carefully ignored
No mention of the scuffle in the corridor
But the questions still got asked

At the nurse's station he was close enough
To hear her call his name
He said, ""It isn't fair, but if he knows I'm here
Her dad will go insane

If there's something you can do about it
Would you try
I just want to hear our baby cry
Even if it's through the glass""

Oh, once in awhile when the odds are against love
And all the events of the heart are on trial
If somebody gives
And leaves the door open

To the power of hope and the will to forgive
Love lives
Three suitcases and a baby seat
And their lives were in a car

Stealing off to the city where they both believed
They could make it if they worked real hard
Three weeks later they were out of that cheap motel
Having dinner at the Taco Bell

When he gave her the ring
Oh, once in awhile when the odds are against love
And all the events of the heart are on trial
If somebody gives

And leaves the door open
To the power of hope and the will to forgive
Love lives
When the preacher said, ""If anyone objects

Speak now or hold your peace""
Every eye in the church turned to watch the man
Who rose up from his seat
But when he said

""I'm sorry for the things I didn't understand
Can I give you to this man""
Everybody cried
Oh, once in awhile when the odds are against love

And all the events of the heart are on trial
If somebody gives
And leaves the door open
To the power of hope and the will to forgive

Chad Brock,"Don't remember what I was saying
The first time I struck a conversation up
But I think that she does

I don't recall what song was playing
The first that I finally felt her touch
But I'm pretty sure that she does

All of those moments now are just a blur
Don't know exactly when I fell for her

But she does something to me that I can't explain
She's a walk in the park, she's a runaway train
She lifts me up, she calms me down
When I can't turn my life around
She does and I probably don't even see
All the little things that she does for me
If anybody on this earth knows the meaning of love
She does

I know my family means the world to me
But sometimes I forget to call them up
I know that she does

I'm working hard every single day
I don't know how to say enough's enough
She does
Without her love I would be half a man
Sometimes I know I'm hard to understand

But she does something to me that I can't explain
She's a walk in the park, she's a runaway train
She lifts me up, she calms me down
When I can't turn my life around
She does and I probably don't even see
All the little things that she does for me
If anybody on this earth knows the meaning of love

She does something to me that I can't explain

Chad Brock,"How'd you do that
I can't describe the way it makes me feel
It threw me off track
Until your kiss I had nerves of steel
Your lips just seem to fit me
All this love is makin' me dizzy

I knew I was gonna see fireworks
The gates of heaven and emotional bliss
Thought I had a great imagination
But I never imagined this

I wasn't ready
The way you touched me scared me
Half to death have mercy
But not enough to let me catch my breath
I dreamed of us together
But this dream is even better

To tell you what I think you already know I never want to hurt you, 
'Cause darlin' I still love you, but things aren't like they used to be, its time for letting go

I wasn't out there looking, but a month a go, 
Last Sunday I met someone just like you, in line at the grocery store, 
And we've been spending time together, yeah, she knows all about you, 
The truth is, she can give me what you can't anymore

Looking back when we first started I never thought id see this day, 
If only I could write the pages our story wouldn't end this way

But you can't really know a man till you've gone where he's been
I could give you all the details, but you'd never understand
What it means to let that woman slip right through your hands

I guess you had to be there when she smiled
Had to feel the passion running wild
To really know the woman and the child
I guess you had to be there

Until she's stripped the layers off and seen into your soul
Till you've watched her make a diamond from a worthless piece of coal
Till you've held an angel and let her fly away

To that old red Trans-Am

Never knew anybody's old man who
Ever got anything right
With every little taste of freedom
I felt about ten feet tall
Back when I was young enough

Home to meet my family

Baby, in my dreams last night we had a glass Camaro
And we drove away down to San Tropez
And we ate chili dogs in a roadside diner
Baby, look I'm on the hook all shook up inside
You're a sweets sweet thing, a dream
You make me want to, want to, want to sing, sing, sing

Chad Brock,"She thought the marriage was over
And she needed a shoulder to cry on
She turned to another
And for one night found a lover but it felt so wrong
The next month they reconciled
But every time she saw him smile
She knew she couldn't tell him about that night
She prays to God he never finds out about the lie

Like a pain almost too much to bear
The guilt will always be right there
Ripping away at her heart
Some would say she's wrong to keep
The secret from him but she
Knows the truth would tear his world apart
She's gonna live and die with the lie

Their little boy turned five the other day
At the party she'd never seen a face so happy
She worries as the years go by
Will he wonder why he don't look like his daddy

She sees them playing in the yard
Their laughter sometimes hits her hard
The bond they share makes her start to cry
In times like that she'd give anything
If she could change the lie

Like a pain almost too much to bear
The guilt will always be right there
Ripping away at her heart
Some would say she's wrong to keep
The secret from him but she
Knows the truth would tear his world apart
She's gonna live and die with the lie

They never spoke about that night they shared so long ago
But every day they pass at work and she wonders if he knows

Like a pain almost too much to bear
The guilt will always be right there
Ripping away at her heart
Some would say she's wrong to keep
The secret from him but she
Knows the truth would tear his world apart

Chad Brock,"What the heck was I thinking
Comin' and livin' in this concrete canyon
Tryin' to swim upstream in a river of vacant-eyed people
Where are they all going so fast
And what in the world could be so important

Man, I miss Mama
Wonder what she's doing
Probably looking out the kitchen window
At that green grass and that clear sky

Daddy's probably sneakin' up behind her
Puttin' his arms around her waist
Restin' that head on her shoulder
Tellin' her how much he loves her

I came this close to making the biggest mistake of my life
Is that a train I hear in the background
You're on the porch aren't you
Got your head resting on that pillow, on the swing
Your bare feet propped up on those chain links
Your toenails painted all cotton candy pink, oh man
Let's see, smog or the smell of summer in your hair
I'm outta here

Baby, I can't tell you how good it felt
Rollin' back into this little map dot
Seeing those sugar maples shading Main Street
And I never noticed it before, but I smiled when I saw
Those post-game celebration beer bottle dents
In that deer crossing sign
Ya know, a few of those were ours
Kiss me, no you kiss me

With you here next to me
In your arms it feels like home

""Wandering vaguely all about, wherever she's so inclined.
She tried to get down to the end of the town. She thought nobody would mind.""
or ""...town, and get back in plenty of time."" or you make something up.]

Well, they called him Super Skier
As he sat around the sundeck,
For he swore that he would never take a spill.
When they finally brought him down
They had to use three toboggans
To carry all the pieces down the hill.
CHORUS:
He was comin' down that slope
Doin' ninety miles an hour
When he caught an edge of his ski.
Well, his clothes, they were fast,
But the slopes, they were faster.
That's the last of Super Skier we shall see.
Well, he hollered, ""What the hell!""
As he lined them parallel:
He figured there was nothing more to learn.
(Oh, no...)
And as he started on his way,
He shouted, ""Ondelay!"",
Assuming that he'd never have to turn.
Well, he was slippin' down that slope
Doin' ninety miles an hour
When a mogul flipped him in the air.
His jumping form was fine
Until he ran into that pine,
And two one-legged skiers left from there.
(repeat CHORUS)
When he left that tree at last,
He was moving twice as fast.
Both halves were skimming moguls like a feather.
He said, ""If I must be
A split personality,
How can I ever keep my knees together?""
One ski was headed north,
And the other headed west,
'Cause both of them, you see, were running freer.
And folks up on Little Nell
Looked up, scared as hell,
Said, ""It's a bird."" ""No, it's a plane."" ""It's Super Skier!""
(No, uh, it's a bird.)
(repeat CHORUS)
Now the moral of my story
(Though my story's kinda gory):
For all you sundeck Charlies, there's still hope.
You buy the fastest clothes you can,
Then talk skiing like a man,
But don't let people catch you on the slope!
(repeat CHORUS)
And let's get Charlie off the M. T. A.

Tell 'em what the master has done.
Tell 'em that the gospel has come.
Tell 'em that the victory's been won.

The streets of heaven are paved with gold.

 (Yes, He did. Yes, He did.)
Some times I hang my head and cry.

Chad Mitchell Trio


It's a long and a dusty road.
It's a hard and a heavy load
And the folks we meet ain't always kind.

Some are bad and some are good.
Some have done the best they could.
Some have tried to ease our troubling mind.

Chorus:
And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound.
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound.

I have traveled across this land
Just a-doing the best I can.
Tryin' to find what I was meant to do.

And the faces that I see
Are as worried as can be.
Looks like they've been wonderin', too.

Chorus

I had a buddy, way back home,
But he started out to roam
And I hear he's out by Monterey,

And sometimes, when I've had a few,
His voice comes singin' through
And I'm a-goin' out to see him some old day.

Chorus

If you see us passin' by
And you sit and you wonder why
And you wish that you were a rambler, too.

Nail your shoes to the kitchen floor,
Lace 'em up, bar the door
And thank the stars for the roof that's over you.

Chorus

And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound,
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound.

I'll cling to the warmth of your hand
I'll do anything to keep you satisfied
I'll love you more than anybody can
 
And the wind will whisper your name to me
Little birds will sing along in time
Leaves will bow down when you walk by
And morning bells will chime
 
I'll be there when you're feeling down
To kiss away the fears if you cry
I'll share with you all the happiness I've found
A reflection of the love in your eyes
 
And I'll sing you the songs of the rainbow
A whisper of the joy that is mine
And leaves will bow down when you walk by
And morning bells will chime
 
I'll walk in the rain by your side
I'll cling to the warmth of your tiny hand
I'll do anything to help you understand

Seven seas that run high

Think I'll go out to Alberta
Weather's good there in the fall

Got some friends I can go to working for
Still I wish you change your mind
If I asked you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times or more

If I get there before the snow flies
And if things are going good 
You could meet me if I send you down the fare

Oh, we're meetin' at the courthouse at eight o'clock tonight
You just walk in the door and take the first turn to the right
Be careful when you get there, we hate to be bereft
But we're taking down the names of everybody turning left
Oh, we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society
Here to save our country from a communistic plot
Join the John Birch Society, help us fill the ranks
To get this movement started we need lots of tools and cranks
Now there's no one that we're certain the Kremlin doesn't touch
We think that Westbrook Pegler doth protest a bit too much
We only hail the hero from whom we got our name
We're not sure what he did but he's our hero just the same
Oh, we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society
Socialism is the ism dismalest of all
Join the John Birch Society, there's so much to do
Have you heard they're serving vodka at the WCTU?
Well you've heard about the agents that we've already named
Well MPA has agents that are flauntedly unashamed
We're after Rosie Clooney, we've gotten Pinkie Lee
And the day we get Red Skelton won't that be a victory
Oh we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society
Norman Vincent Peale may think he's kidding us along
But the John Birch Society knows he spilled the beans
He keeps on preaching brotherhood, but we know what he means
We'll teach you how to spot 'em in the cities or the sticks
For even Jasper Junction is just full of Bolsheviks
The CIA's subversive and so's the FCC
There's no one left but thee and we, and we're not sure of thee

Here to save our country from a communistic plot
Join the John Birch Society holding off the Reds
We'll use our hand and hearts and if we must we'll use our heads
Do you want Justice Warren for your Commissar?
Do you want Mrs. Krushchev in there with the DAR?
You cannot trust your neighbor or even next of kin
If mommie is a commie then you gotta turn her in
Oh, we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society
Fighting for the right to fight the right fight for the Right

Chad Mitchell,"I'm just a typical American boy
From a typical American town
I believe in God and Senator Dodd
And an keepin' old Castro down

And when it came my time to serve
I knew better dead than red
But when I got to my old draft board
Buddy, this is what I said

Sarge, I'm only eighteen, I got a ruptured spleen
And I always carry a purse
I got eyes like a bat, and my feet are flat
My asthma's getting worse

Consider my career, my sweetheart dear
My poor old invalid aunt
Besides, I ain't no fool, and I'm goin' to school
And I'm workin' in a defense plant

I've got a dislocated disc and a racked up back
I'm allergic to flowers and bugs
And when the bombshell hits, I get epileptic fits
And I'm addicted to a thousand drugs

I got the weakness woes, I can't touch my toes
I can hardly reach my knees
And if the enemy ever came close to me
Well, I'd probably start to sneeze

Sarge, I'm only eighteen, I got a ruptured spleen
And I always carry a purse
I got eyes like a bat, and my feet are flat
My asthma's getting worse

Consider my career, my sweetheart dear
My poor old invalid aunt
Besides, I ain't no fool, I'm a goin' to school
And I'm workin' in a defense plant

I hate Chou En Lai, and I hope he dies
But I think you gotta see
That if someone's gotta go over there
That someone isn't me

So, have a ball, Sarge, watch 'em fall
Yeah, kill me a thousand or so
And if you ever get a war without any gore
Well, I'll be the first to go

Sarge, I'm only eighteen, I got a ruptured spleen
And I always carry a purse
I got eyes like a bat, and my feet are flat
My asthma's getting worse

Consider my career, my sweetheart dear
I got to water my rubber tree plant
Besides, I ain't no fool, I'm a goin' to school
And I'm workin' in a defense plant

Sarge, I'm only eighteen, I got a ruptured spleen
And I always carry a purse
I got eyes like a bat, and my feet are flat
My asthma's getting worse

Consider my career, my sweetheart dear

Besides, I ain't no fool, I'm a goin' to school

Funeral Directors of America, I am very deeply honored standing here;
Receiving this token of your esteem, ""The Funeral Director of the
Year.""
Now I've been asked by all the delegates--and members of the board,
To tell you of the funeral that won me this award.
It was handled with taste and dignity, that much I can say for it;
And I'm sure it will take the family twenty years to pay for it!

[Chorus:]
It was a helluva fun'ral, It was a helluva fun'ral
The finest fun'ral ever booked:
I had some high school juniors who passed around petunial
And lilies everywhere you looked.
It was a helluva fun'ral, I say one helluva fun'ral
Oh, how I wish that you were there;
I had ten drum majorettes doubling on the castanets
It really was a lively affair
It really was a lively affair.
It was a helluva fun'ral, It was a helluva fun'ral
The national guard showed up for me;
And during the oration, they went into formation
And formed the letters R. I. P.
It was a helluva fun'ral, I say one helluva fun'ral
I gave it all my loving care;
The band was on its toes playing ""Mexicali Rose"",
It really was a lively affair.
It really was a lively affair.
A tisket a tasket, Tell us about the casket

[Spoken:]
Well, I'll tell you 'bout the casket, my good friends
It would-a made your poor eyes pop
It was sterling silver all around and a real formica top.
(Formica top, it had a formica top).
Well, I'll tell you 'bout the widow, my good friends,
The widow was in navy blue
With a gown designed by Balenciaga, I supplied that too.
(He sold the widow widow's weeds too).
I held the first funereal raffle, though I don't much like to boast
And I gave away a Chevrolet to the person who cried the most.
(He gave away a brand new Chevrolet). I won it myself!
There were eighteen jugglers by the grave to demonstrate their art
And when they were done, I fired a gun to let the hoot-e-nanny start.
(He fired a gun and the hoot-e-nanny begun).
I was serving beer and prtzels, 'til the hot pastrami came;
And I sold some souvenir hankies with the dear departed's name.
(He was sellin' hankies with the dear departed's name).
As a fitting finale we had the Rockettes from New Your's Music Hall;
As you can see, my very good friends
All in all, all in all:
[Sung:]
It was a helluva fun'ral, I say one helluva fun'ral

Can't find a woman who's nice and pretty
They all look like page in a magazine
Legs are long and they eat like a sparrow
Figures stick to the straight and narrow
Top and the bottom are same as in between

Show me a pretty little number
When she walks it rolls like thunder
Eyes as deep and dark as the deep blue sea
Round right here and round right there
Pretty red lips and her very own hair
Wrap her up, she's the natural girl for me

Way down in a coffeehouse palace
Found a little lady and her name was Alice
She had friends and her friends had her it seems
Face was dirty and her sweater was baggy
Pants were tight and her hair was shaggy
I've seen her kind on college football teams

Show me a pretty little number
When she walks it rolls like thunder
Eyes as deep and dark as the deep blue sea
Round right here and round right there
Pretty red lips and her very own hair
Wrap her up, she's the natural girl for me

Well, way up at a penthouse pretty
Thirteen miles up above the city
I met a little lady from a wealthy family
Now she could cuss like a real longshoreman
She was making eyes at the doorman
She made a most unusual offer to me

I met a lady, she was very arty
She took me home to see her studio
She took out her paints and she whispered to me
She said that she wanted to 'do' me
Some of that paint will never come off, I know

Days and nights are one or so it seems
Why then do you say you've got to leave me
When you can answer all my prayers and dreams?

Stay with me, stay with me

If you leave me this time
It will be the last time

'Tis of the noble Stewball, a gallant racing pony
'Tis also of his rider, who brought ol' Stewball over
He's the diamond of the land and he rolls around in clover

Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win

Oh, the horses they were all brought out with saddle, whip and bridle
The gentlemen did shout when they saw the gallant riders
And some did shout, ""Hooray"" and the air was filled with curses
On the mare, Griselda, the sportsmen lay their purses

Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win

Oh, the trumpet it did sound, and they shot off like an arrow
Ol' Stewball scarcely touched the ground, and the goin' it was narrow

?Oh the gray will win the day, and Stewball, he can foller?

Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win

In the middle of the track, up spoke the noble rider
?I fear we must fall back, that gray is runnin' like a tiger?
Up spoke the noble horse, ""Ride on, ride on my master
We're only half way round the course, and now we'll see who's faster?

Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win

And as they did discourse, ol' Stewball flew like lightnin'
He dashed around the course, and the gray mare she was taken
Ride on, ride on, my noble horse for a good two hundred guineas
Your saddle, it shall be of gold when we pick up our winnings

Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win

Well, past the winning post, bold Stewball went so handy
And both the horse and rider called for sherry, wine and brandy
They drank to that gray mare, the gallant Miss Griselda
And to all who lost their money on the sporting plains of Kildare

Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win

Becoming a habit? (Chasing the rabbit.)
Is it amnesia?
Amamaemonesia,
Mistaken for magic? (Mistaken for magic. Mistaken for magic.)

Spacing out in a nook and cranny
It's officially uncanny
It's a fish in a sea of granite
Just leave alone the geminis
Two of them and four of I's
No one could not agree (it's unanimously decided)
They've come for you and me (that we're dangerously surrounded)
Their boats are full of flames
They paint the grasses green
Repeating history
They don't say what they mean

Is it amnesia

There's a system of symbols that no one will vouch for
Everyone uses, but no one believes
There's a dog in the yard with a manner that's ruff
Yet there's something about you that he understands
The girl at the window, covered in ashes
Smiles grotesquely in the light of the day
Singing in German, a cold summer warning
But I can't remember what I meant to say...

Is it Amanaemonesia

With or without you I don't have a choice

Just let me hear some of that
Rock And Roll Music,
Any old way you choose it,
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it.
It's gotta be Rock And Roll Music,
If you want to dance with me,
If you want to dance with me.

I've got no kick againt modern jazz,
Unless they try to play it too darn fast,
And change the beauty of the melody,
Until they sounded like a symphony,
That's why I go for that
Rock and roll music 

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man await a sax,
I must admit the have a rockin' band,
Man they were going like a hurricane
That's why I go for that
Rock and roll music 

Way down South they gave a jubilee,
The jockey folks they had a jamboree,
They're drinkin' homebrew from a water cup,
The folks dancin' they all got shook up
And started playin' that
Rock and roll music 

Don't care to hear 'em play a tango,
I'm in the mood to dig a mambo,
It's way to early for a congo,
So keep a rockin' that piano

Chaka Khan,"I was born in Lil' Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I was hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pig tails
I know I loved her even then
You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boohooed it
But I told them time and time again
""Don't you know I was made to love her
Built a world all around her""
Yah! Hey, hey, hey
She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years
I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey
All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby. Ah!
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere
I was knee high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there
'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah!
Ah, I was made to love her
Built my world all around her
Hey, hey, hey
Oo baby, I was made to please her
You know Stevie ain't gonna leave her, no

Oo my baby loves me",I Was Made to Love Him
Chaka Khan,"Love is a burning inside
I never had this feeling before, no
All I know is that it won't let me be myself
Hey, is this really love
Oh maybe that's the reason
I feel so good when you're around
(Feel so good when you're around)

Why can't I remember
The day I melted before your charms
Oh was it way back in September
When you held me in your arms
Now that I see that you're the one for me
It's no more a mystery
Love has fallen down on me
Ooh I'm in love with you

Love has fallen on me
Now I really see
Love has fallen on me

Oh what tender love you bring
No, it's not a game
Oh what tender love you bring
No, it's not a game
Hey what tender love you bring
I fell in love with you
Fell in love with you

One day in September love came falling down on me
One day in September love came tumbling down on me

Ooh what tender love you bring
Oh now Lord I can't, no no,
And I can't believe my eyes
No no one day in September,
It came on down
Oh fallin' down, love came falling all around

I fell in love with you
Fell in love with you

Chaka Khan,"I never meant a single thing when you tried it
You know it, I felt it, I liked it, I did it
I never meant to put it there but somewhere In despair
It got moved into view, then I liked it
I never meant a single word when I said I could love you
I thought it, I heard it, I used it
I never meant a single beat of my heart to be yours
Cause I knew, if you knew, you'd abuse it

[Chorus]
There's a message in the middle of the bottom
You see 'em, you love 'em, you got 'em
There's a proper time to pick 'em when they're fallen
Just listen, you'll hear 'em a-callin
There's a special way to know you got his lovin'
Can't you feel it, you ought to, you taught him
There's a special time for lovin' and another time
For huggin and a lot of time to leave him alone

I have a feelin' deep inside that I've got you
I'll keep you. why not? it'll make me feel better
If there's a woman on this earth who should love you
It's me boy, don't fight it, admit it, you love it
If you think there's someone else who can move you
I'll lose you, no problem, you're free to go get her
I just refuse to let a lady step in on my show
If you choose, do it now or forget it

Roll me through the rushes like Moses
Roll me through the rushes just like Moses

Roll me through the rushes like Moses
Guide me to the new woman who waits
Current, leave me on the banks
By the cottage
Where we will dine with silver cups
And golden plates

[Chorus]

I've prepared for my last journey
You know I've worked all my life
To make this basket strong
But a woman alone on a river
She can't stay in the water too long

I've been chilled, I've lost my will
And I've stayed away from rivers
Much too long
I really must stay in this dirty dirty city
Till I found out that my strength was gone

[Chorus]

Just like Moses

Make my journey, make it short in space
Let me lose this hardness that I got now, Lord
Water, wash away all traces of hate
I will do what you say
If you just show me how, river

We'll shut out the lights, close our eyes
I don't know how this started
I don't know why we fight
I'll apologize for all the unkind things
I said to you
Why can't I see what's right for me
Might not be right for you

You might be better off alone

Oh, you're still the man
You know just where you stand
But the way you felt for me is gone

If it's done, then, baby, it's done
But there's nowhere to go
If we leave it all behind

Chaka Khan,"A long time ago in the forties
Dizzy and bird gave us this song
They called it ""a night in Tunisia""
And the melody still lingers on

It was new and very strange
Blew the squares right off the stage
Few could play along
But the melody still lingers on

Max and miles to name just two
Together they grew
The music was young and strong
And the melody still lingers on

They paved the way for generations
From Coltrane to Stevie
No one could stop the winds of change
Without them where'd we be?

The past you can't ignore
The torch is lit, we'll keep the flame
And the melody remains the same

Somewhere in my dreams
I may never have met you at all

You'll know me too
And see that we were
Meant to be together, my dear

Throw my heart away each spring
Now a spring romance
Hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to winter
All I've got to show's a splinter
For my little fling

Spring, this year has got me feeling like a horse
That never left the post
I lay in my room
Starring up at the ceiling
Spring can really hang you up the most

Morning kiss wakes trees and flower
And to them my life
To drink a toast I walk in the park
Just to kill those lonely hours
Spring can really hang you up the most

All afternoon
Those birds tweet-a-tweet I know their tune
This is love this is it
Heard it before
And I know the score
And I decide that love is a bore
Love seem sure around the new year
Now it's April

Love is just a ghost
Spring arrived on time
But what became of you, dear
Spring can really hang you up the most
Spring can really hang you up the most

Spring is here
There's no mistaken
Robins build their nest from coast to coast
My heart tries the same
So they won't hear it breaking
Spring can really hang you up the most

College boys are riding somewhere
Tender passion there it grows
But I'm on the shelf with last years easter bonnet
Spring can really hang you up the most

Love came my way
I'm holding the last
We had our day
Now that's all in the past
Spring came along
A season of song
For love's sweet promise
But something went wrong
Doctor's once prescribed a tonic
Sulfur and molasses was the dose
Didn't help me a bit
My condition must be chronic
Spring can really hang you up the most

All alone, the party's over
Winter was a gracious host
But when you keep praying
For snow to hide the clover
Spring can really hang you up the most",Spring Can Really Hang You up the Most

That's all I am
And I think I'm falling
For an ordinary man

When the love begins
You and I can only try
To make a love with no strings
Take me to your heart
When the story ends
You and I we can't deny
We're making love with no strings
No conductor
Could've played this situation
Better than a fool or millionaire
I won't tie you down
With a little love and affection
All I want to do is share

A little time together
Maybe holding hands
An ordinary woman
And an ordinary man

Take me to your heart
When the love begins
You and I could say goodbye
And we'll always be friends
Take me to your heart
When the story ends
You and I we can't deny
We got a love with no strings

Love you all my lifetime
Lost to you eternally
Everything in my life
Tells me we were meant to be

Strange there's always something wrong

What part did I play in that game
And now, now you turn away
Excuses are too late
Feelin' so in need, I'll never be at peace

And low as can be?

And the tunes I request aren't always the best

Chaka Khan,"I got a problem with democracy
Don't know what it really means
A livin' lie, devoid of honesty
Where nothing's really what it seems

I'm in a funky situation
Doom is lurkin' ever nearer
I'm waiting for a revelation
Each day the signs are getting' clearer

Lies to my left, wrong to my right
Compassion unknown
This must be the twilight zone
A grizzly affair
Caught unaware
Why am I so scared
Where have all the flowers gone?

I've got a problem with democracy
So where exactly do I stand?
Who is this dark cloud hangin' over me?
It ain't from God; it must be a man
He is the one that you will seldom see
The new world order is his name
He's got a plan in mind for you and me
There are no winners in this game

Lies to my left, wrong to my right
Compassion unknown
This must be the twilight zone
And I'm standin' here
Tryin' to lose the fear
For this I would die
The truth will open up my eyes

Love will set you free from democracy

Supreme power invested in the people
Is a bit extreme
The highest rank of authority
Only God is Supreme!

",Democrazy
Chaka Khan,"In this ever-changing world
Where things become unfurled
And tethered
Like a lioness in her pride
I was gonna stay by your side
Forever

As a planet keeps her moon
Your love I had assumed
And taken
And if this love can't come to pass
Then I would be alas
Forsaken

[Chorus]
The drama of the chase
The look upon your face
Make up your mind
It would be a waste
If you didn't love me
It would be the drama of all time

If I'm not good enough for you
What else could I do?
I could change
You know, they say like wine
You get better with passin' time
How strange ?.
I wish that in your eyes
You saw me like the others
See me
I could never say enough
Darlin' just how much I
Wish you'd keep me

[Chorus]
Drama, drama of all time
It's been ten long years
Since I fell in love so dear
It's got to be the drama of all time
Called you on the telephone
And wondered if you were alone
It's got to be the drama of all time
When I called you back, it was busy
What was that?
It's a drama, drama of all time
Who were you with last night?
Busy, busy, you must be busier
Than a one-legged man in a kick fight
Got to be the drama of all time

Sad but true, I slept with you
I thought we were in love
I even got me a rose tattoo
But that was not enough

Never, no!
Never, never, never
Nothing but the best of me
I gave with open arms
Alive and well, I'm back from hell
Released from your charms (it's time to go)

For only one man

Pop, pop my clutch (4x)

Don't worry 'bout the weather
In London or Rome
Once we get together
You're gonna take me home
I've had plenty boyfriends
Now I need a man
To love me, whatever
And a ring on my hand

Listen pretty baby
I won't say it twice
You could save me
From my own device

Honesty is so refreshing
I don't get that much
You just might be the blessing
To make me pop my clutch

Now that you're gone
I need to belong, believe me, baby

I would be so glad
If you would reconsider and stay
Reconsider, reconsider, reconsider

Baby's cryin' it's so cold in our place inside I'm dyin'
We need the smile on your face don't need no money
I don't need no girlfriends, want my daddy
To love me again and again and again and

I would be so glad
If you would reconsider and stay
Reconsider, reconsider, reconsider

Sometimes honey I know I talk too loud
Short temper I'm apt to cuss you, you
I don't mean it, passion gets the best of me
Still I love you and I feel like you love me too

I would be so glad
If you would reconsider and stay
Reconsider, reconsider, reconsider

If you walk out that door
You betta reconsider this if you don't call me no more
You betta reconsider, reconsider that, reconsider
If you think you were lonely before

You betta reconsider that if you stop payin' these bills
You gotta reconsider I betcha somebody will

I like his recipe
That's why I'm layin'

You are just like my favorite spoon
'Cause you stir me up
I'm as full as a harvest moon
Still I need more in my cup
And only you can give it to me

Am I happy?

Don't be so emotional

Will he be there?

Chaka Khan,"This is a story of mind, soul and heart
Come to think of it, don't know where to start
I'd take it from the top but we don't have that much time
So I'm breakin' off a piece of this crazy life of mine

As a little girl, I had a stubborn mind
Bonnie and me were wild most of the time
I used to sing for mama's company
I guess that was the start of the woman I came to be

Sometimes young, yet so old
Warm to the touch, intellectually cold
I love the how and why of it
Thank God, the pieces seem to fit
Pieces seem to fit in this crazy life of mine

Never will forget from whence I came
I have some regrets but I made myself a name
Two times a mother and as many times wed
Tough times were around me but better times ahead

If your heart can handle these words I've said
I see you and me in this crazy life of mine
Mine
Gotcha

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories,
When my heart is still with you,
And ol' midnight knows it, too.

When a quarrel we had needs mending,
Does it mean that our love is ending.
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart,
And I'm out of my mind.

Chaka Khan,"I used to think that I was happy

Chakuza,"Du willst was sagen, aber keiner hört dir zu und du gibst auf
Und du gehst baden, Mann, wie ein zu nah am Fluss gebautes Haus
Halt die Schnauze!
Jeder, der mir sagt, es geht nach oben, hat gelogen
Denn in Wahrheit ist mein Schlafplatz noch am Boden
Ich muss nicht nach Hollywood und mit allen Stars Sekt saufen
Ich muss mit dem Bus noch zu Aldi fahren und Essen kaufen
Nur weil ich rappe, kann ich Essen kaufen
Auch wenn mein Geld längst nicht reicht, um hier endlich mal wegzulaufen
Ich schreibe Zeilen und ich pack sie auf meinen Beat
Während die Kleinen aus Verzweiflung auf der Straße stehen und dealen
Seht die Wahrheit, dass mein Partner in dem Lied
Kids der Straße widerspiegelt und ein Pate ist für sie
Denk' mal nach, was sie dir sagen, ist das echt oder der letzte Stuss?
Ja, Mann, ich laber Dreck, wenn ich den ganzen Tag Dreck fressen muss
Und ja, sie wollen weg und einen Entschluss ziehen und da raus
Doch wie es aussieht, Mann, verpassen sie den letzten Bus hier raus

Es tut mir leid, (tut mir leid)

Ich hör' den ganzen Tag, ich wär' für unsere Jugend zu schlimm
Weil ihr meint, dass meine Texte viel zu skrupellos sind
Wo sind die Kinder? Wo sind sie, wenn die Schule beginnt?
Du siehst sie sitzen draußen auf der Straße und sie suchen den Sinn
Es geht um Klauen und um Dealerei, jeder will ein Spieler sein
Heute ist es Gras ticken und morgen Autoschieberei
Okay, das gibt's in Dörfern nicht
Doch ich lebe in Berlin
Wo sich ein Junkie jede Scheiße in den Körper spritzt
Was kann ich dafür, dass so etwas passiert?
Denkt ihr, ich hab' durch Musik eure Kinder dazu animiert?
Ich denke manchmal echt, dass es keiner begreifen mag
Ich hab' eure Kinder so gemacht, das war leicht gesagt
Das Produkt meiner Umwelt
Ihr habt mich erschaffen und jetzt guckt, wie euer Weltbild umfällt
Sag', was die Scheiße soll, fünf mal einfach Gold
Super Chakuza, Bruder, mach' jetzt die Österreicher stolz

(Und wollt ihr uns jetzt sagen, da ist gar nichts wahr und alles fake?)
Beweg' deinen Arsch hierher und, ja, dann wage es am Rad zu drehen
(Wage es am Rad zu drehen,) klar, denn du bist cool und hart
(Und nach einer Minute, Junge, wartet dein Besuch beim Arzt.)
Ich mach' keinen Spaß, Ramba Zamba oder Science Fiction
(Kids voller Verzweiflung, Bruder, Vater, beide sitzen
Und ist dein Vater zwar frei,) und das ist kein Witz
Dann hat er keine Arbeit und nachmittags schon einen sitzen
(Sieh uns an, wir leuchten heller als ein Stern)
Auch wenn deine Eltern sagen „Von den Männern halt dich fern!“
(Diese Männer ziehen durch's Land, machen Geld, als ob nichts wär')
Und beim Rest aus diesem Land bleibt der Teller immer leer
(Wir sind nicht schuld daran, dass Kinder nicht mehr reden und sich schlagen,)
Weil sie sehen, wie ihre Stars sind und sie leben, was wir sagen
(Und es ist nicht leicht, hoffnungsvoll zu beten und dann teilen,)
So 'ne Scheiße, Gott hat leider nicht für jeden von uns Zeit

Es tut mir leid, (tut mir leid)

Chakuza,"Ich kapier' das hier nie, ich versteh's nicht
Aber irgendwie fehlen mir die täglichen Depris
Im Schädel die Hintergrundmusik
Als hätte ich Tetris auf der zehnten Stufe gespielt
Ich schmiss damals als Kind, 'ne Party bei McDonald's
Doch es kamen nur Harlekins wie Ronald
Aber als vor dem Sommer ein Anruf kam
Dachte ich, oh man, wieder Eier für die Pfannkuchen da
Was soll ich anfangen, da ich wie so oft keinen Plan hat
Kaufe erstmal meinem Mädchen das versprochene Fahrrad
Das rote oder in weiß
Oder gleich beide, weil die Kohle nun reicht
Komm steig ein, lass uns wegfahren,
Denn ich komme mir so unheimlich groß vor
Denn mein Auto hat ein Lenkrad und einen Motor
Ein Wunder, unglaublich, undenkbar
Schon seit Tagen ist die Laune nicht mehr unten im Keller

(Und alles) wieder gut das Gefühl im Bauch
Unglaublich, kein Ruß, Blütenstaub
(Denn alles) sorgenfrei, unbekannt
Halt die Zeit für 'ne Stunde an

(Und alles) wieder gut das Gefühl im Bauch
Unglaublich, kein Ruß, Blütenstaub
(Denn alles) sorgenfrei, unbekannt
Halt die Zeit für 'ne Stunde an

Ich kapier' das hier nie. Was und wie? Keine Ahnung!
Im Briefkasten liegt mal wieder keine Mahnung
Im Kopf hab ich Musik, doch keine Oper ertönt
Nein, Kings Of Leon mit „Closer“ wie schön
Und so hab ich es mir immer vorgestellt, dass
Es nicht in Worte zu fassen ist, überfordert mich fast
Rein ins Bett, ein Traum oder echt?
Ich gähne, kneif mich selbst, blauer Fleck, der Zehnte
Für 'n Tapetenwechsel ewig gebraucht,
Leg mich auf die bequemste Couch, die Ikea verkauft
Und guck mal ich habe 'ne Matratze im Bett
Und mein Hund endlich Futter im Napf, das ihm schmeckt
Endlich seh' ich meinen Dad und meine Schwester mal wieder
Ich hab Geld für Benzin, 1, 60 pro Liter
Doch ich traue mich jetzt noch nicht loszufahren
Blauer Fleck Nummer elf auf dem Oberarm

(Und alles) wieder gut das Gefühl im Bauch
Unglaublich, kein Ruß, Blütenstaub
(denn alles) sorgenfrei, unbekannt
Halt die Zeit für 'ne Stunde an

Nun hat sich doch alles zum Positiven gewendet
Denn nach so langer Zeit im Abseits waren Liebe und Vertrauen
Gefühle, die ich nicht mehr kannte
Drei Jahre lang ging ich durch's Leben wie ein Schlafwandler
Dann bin ich aufgewacht und entdeckte die Welt für mich neu
Dabei alle, wirklich alle falschen Freunde und schlechte Menschen 
Gegen die guten getauscht
Mein Gott das war nicht immer leicht,
Aber jetzt kann ich endlich wieder auf mein Herz hören
Ich bin glücklich
Überglücklich
Und ich danke all jenen, die mein Leben etwas besser gemacht haben
Schöner gemacht haben und ein Teil dieses Albums waren

Chakuza,"Ich setz' mich hin und schreibe einfach mal den Brief meines Lebens
Erzähle alles einem Blatt, egal wie viel ihn lesen
Seh' mich gerade noch am Strand spazieren, Hand in Hand mit meiner Frau
Ich hab mich vor 'ner Wand platziert, starr sie an, wein mich aus
Reibe meine Augen spür' den Sand in ihn' und heule los
Noch vor Tagen war das alles angenehm, die Freude groß
Heute tobt ein Sturm in meinem Kopf und hört nicht auf zu wüten
Sonne weg der Wind macht braunes Laub, blaue Blüten
Steh auf und geh zum Kühlschrank hol das vierte Bier raus
Was sich in meim' Bierglas spiegelt, das sieht wirklich nicht nach mir aus
Ich verlier' mich gerade selbst verdammt ich kenn' das leider schon
Es fühlt sich an als würde irgend so ein Fremder in mir wohn'
Hab die Kräfte nie geschont, bekomm' die Rechnung präsentiert
Denn im echten Leben läuft es nun mal echt nicht wie geschmiert
Mein Gedächtnis explodiert es vermischt sich alles kreuz und quer
Und alles was mir früher einmal leicht fiel, fällt mir heute schwer

Wieder muss der Boden unter meinen Füßen beben
So bedrohlich dieses honigsüße Leben
Ich geh den Weg den die großen Männer gegangen sind
Das hat sich verändert von jetzt an geh ich woanders hin

Aber niemand hat die Kräfte weder Zwerge noch Riesen
Um die Hälfte eines Berges zu verschieben
Und so schieb' ich eben meinen Berg alleine
Doch egal wie alleine ich bin, ich kriegs' hin

Aber niemand hat die Kräfte weder Zwerge noch Riesen

Und so schieb' ich eben meinen Berg alleine
Doch egal wie alleine ich bin, ich kriegs' hin

Ich setz' mich hin und nun beginnt ein neuer Part meines Lebens
Nehme alle alten Dinge, mal' nen Grabstein daneben
Grabe alles das was etwas schlimmes ist ein
Ich habe so viel falsch gemacht aber so will ich nicht sein
Ich wär' gern wie alle andern' gern ein friedlicher Vater
Aber ziehe durch die Bars, gestiefelter Kater
Muss mich abschießen, denn sonst mach ich heut Nacht wieder kein Auge zu
Anstatt es zu verarbeiten, kipp ich lieber aus den Schuhen
Genug und Happy Birthday Chak, willkomm' im neuen Leben
Da wo alle Leute die du mal enttäuscht hast dir vergeben
Ja ich sehs' da war ein Licht, jippie, wieder am Leben
Und ich werd' mein altes Ich wie 'nen Marienkäfer zertreten
Vergeblich was gesucht, was mich mal glücklich macht
Und nun ist das in Wirklichkeit passiert sag wie verrückt ist das
Spielt die ganze Welt verrückt, denn ich hab endlich meinen Platz
Das letzte mal die Füllfeder noch angefasst, ich schreibe was

Wieder muss der Boden unter meinem Füßen beben

Den Frühling heute Morgen begrüßt und angelacht
Ich konnt' die ganze Nacht nicht schlafen, war wach
Einen Kaffee nehmen um 8, kalte Pizza von gestern

Hallo, alles Schwachsinn, wie der Text eines Schlagers
Da sie mich, als ich zur Welt kam, verwechselt ham', damals
Ich wollt' Ralleyfahrer werden, kein beschissener Versager
Besitz nicht mal 'n Fahrrad, schleppe Kisten im Lager

Doch sitz' mit Dosenbier am Sofa, statt mit Noten vorm Klavier
Ohne Hosen, unrasiert, schlechter Atem, schlechte Karten
Verpass' die besten Tage, die Welt hat nicht gewartet

Da ist der Lärm, alles nervt und mein Hals tut mir weh
Besser ohne viel Gerede wieder schlafen zu gehen

Jeden Abend, jede Bar, steh ich da und schnorre Drinks
Schnorre Kippen, aber schicke in den Himmel, was sie oben nicht haben
Zitronenlimonade, Chips und Schokolade
Nun sitz' ich da und finde keine Worte
Leider kein Spaß, keiner springt aus der Torte
Doch ab Morgen werde ich mich wohl messen mit den Größten
Geh zum Bäcker, hol Brötchen und wecke Dornröschen
Und wir gehn' spazieren im Park, werden einmützen im Gras
Einen Moment lang fühln' wie ein glückliches Paar
Manchmal hab ich das Gefühl, ich würde dich hassen
Nix machen, oder unsere Brücken einstürzen lassen

Chakuza,"Man sitzt im Auto oder Bus die Fahrt beginnt
Jedes Bild das man im Kopf hat hat die Tragik eines Films
Doktor Schiwago auf der Leinwand flimmert wie schöne Kerzen
Ganz alleine keine Kinder die mit Klingeltönen nerven
Leere Blicke allen zieht es das Gesicht runter im Herbst
Wir wären alle lieber Krabben fang' am Fischkutter im Meer
Mehr ist nicht drin, es bleiben leider alle Tage die gleichen
Sehen die Freiheit durch vereiste und beschlagene Scheiben
Alles Chaos, das war wohl die Hälfte unsres' Lebens
Lagen regungslos da, Marionetten ohne Fäden
Unser Platz in der Bahn ist wohl übrig geblieben
Wir fahren zum Flughafen, denn da gibt es Züge die fliegen
Und wir fahren, wir sind alt und die Haare werden schütter
War noch niemals in Australien, Koalabären füttern
Doch zum Glück machte ich damals noch das Radio an
Und mit Gitarren hat das alles begonn'

Ich dreh' mal lauter, dass der schöne Sound nach außen dringt
Ich merk', hör ich genauer hin, dass hundert andre' auch mitsing'
Unglaublich wie man sehen kann,
Das jedes Ding das uns je gequält hat schmilzt wie ein Schneeball
In der Gegenwart bin ich zufrieden, ziemlich schräge Sache
Ja fast niedlich, denn man sieht sogar die Zähne wenn ich lache
Alles das hat dieses Lied geschafft, ich lieb' es
Für immer auf Repeat schalten und nie wieder die Beatles
Ich schrieb gefühlte tausend Jahre negative Dinge
Denn ich war über den Ausgang meines Lebens nie im Bilde
War kein Wille da, jeder kleine Blick, den ich erhascht hab
Wie auch immer wurde das im Keim erstickt und damit Basta
Langsam wird es eng, wir werden älter und nicht jünger
Jeden Tag wird der Kalender etwas dünner
Doch wir wollten nichts verändern, sondern alles sollte bleiben
Wie es ist, wir liefen einfach davon

Ich bin fast taub durch das Heulen in der Gegend
Meine Ohren tun weh, tausende Feuerwehrsirenen
Ich steh' draußen, zähl' die Autos die geschwind an mir vorbeifahren
Und halte die Momente fest wie Bilder die man einrahmt
Was passiert ist all die Jahre, tragisch nah bei mir
Ließ meine Arme mit 'ner Nadel verzieren
Doch mit dem Alter wird das alles mal an Farbe verlieren
Ich hab's kapiert, doch egal was noch kommen mag soll komm'

Chakuza,"Ich Spinner bin mal wieder schlecht drauf und diesmal schlimmer als gedacht
Ja, ich weiß, das ist nur eines der zehn Dinge, die du an mir hasst
Ich trinke Schnaps aus dem Fass, schlaf' am Boden ein
Und kann mit meiner Fahne zwei Nationen vereinen
Manchmal raste ich aus, verliere oft den Verstand
Erst kommt der Hass dann das Loch in der Wand, dann die gebrochene Hand
Die Nachbarn dachten, Mord, Einbruch und Überfall
Da wir morgens um drei uns noch streiten und die Türen zuknallen
Aber Entwarnung, war nur mörderische Wut
Schlimme Wörter, doch es fließt kein Blut, ich finde das gehört dazu
Zu uns beiden wie ist das möglich? Wir machen
Streit aus fröhlichem Lachen und kleine Vögel zu Drachen
Zuhause rauer Seegang, ein Klabautermannpaar
Ich hab das erste Glas aufgebwahrt, das 'ne Frau nach mir warf
Ja, ich hab es mir gemerkt und gelernt aus den Fehlern
Besser schläft man auf Federn als auf 'ner Couch aus braunem Leder

Ich befürchte ganz egal auf welcher Wolke ich nun schwebe
Wir als Paar führen eine Hollywoodehe
Und doch führ' ich mein Mädchen trotz den Fehlern, die ich habe
Irgendwann mal zum Altar, Telenovelafinale

Zehn Dinge waren's am Anfang, zwei hab ich im Griff, jetzt sind's Acht
Oft war's ein Drama, Tage des Donners
Der Kontostand am Arsch, keine Bahamas im Sommer
Etwas Sonne und wir könnten uns nicht glücklicher schätzen
Doch Frau Holle über uns schüttelt die Betten
Echt an schneebedeckten Tagen wie diesen
Will Schafen den Schädel einschlagen, begrabe Hasen und Riesen
Und da ist wieder diese Rauchwolke und geht nie weg
Wie traurig, wir besetzen beide Hauptrollen in Breaking Bad
Ich weiß am Ende hast du mich gerettet wie 'nen verletzten Igel
Kein Bedenken, echte Liebe, Kleiderspende, Fetzen fliegen
Lippen geschloßen, draufgebissen. Wie oft
Hast du 'nen Blitz auf mich geschossen wie ein griechischer Gott
Doch es macht jetzt keinen Sinn, wir reden morgen irgendwann
Ich leg mich hin und sag am nächsten Tag good Morning, Vietnam

Ich befürchte ganz egal auf welcher Wolke ich nun schwebe
Wir als Paar führen eine Hollywoodehe
Und doch führ' ich mein Mädchen trotz den Fehlern, die ich habe

Wir könnten neue Möbel brauchen, wenn wir gestritten haben
Die Vögel hören auf zu zwitschern, jetzt fang' ich erst an
Stell dir die Frage, ob du mich ehrlich noch liebst
Denn du hast jedem unserer Teller nun gelehrt wie man fliegt
Porzellan ist am zerbrechen, was führen ekelhaftes Pärchen
Blanker Horror für die sprechende Teekanne im Märchen
Ich beschwer' mich nicht, ich bin nur ganz offen und sag's
Gott sei Dank ist mein Kopf nicht aus Glas

Bringt mich nicht um, ich hab' mehr Luft als eine Blaskapelle
Zerstarrt im eigenen, im fremden Mercedes
Denn mein Kahn zieh' ich alleine bis zum Ende des Weges
Erstmal den Schädel säubern, ich fang' mein Leben neu an
Endlich Frieden und weit weg von diesen Seelenräubern
Anfangs war's nicht klug von zu Hause wegzuziehen
Aber nun sieht meine Zukunft endlich gut aus in Berlin
Denn verstanden hab' ich nie, warum das alles in die Brüche ging
Warum ich seit zwei Jahren keinen Tag lang mehr nüchtern bin
Ich wünschte ich hätte manches nicht getan, viel Mist gebaut
Ich würd' das nicht mehr machen, aber irgendwie vermisse ich's auch

Im Laufe der Zeit beginnt man Dinge umzuwerfen, umzudenken auch wenn
Tausende Erinnerungen sterben, ich werde manches wegwerfen und
Nachdenken verwirrt mich, ich weiß nicht mehr, was seit letztem März passiert ist

Viel lieber war ich Stargast auf zehntausenden Partynächten
Vergaß all diejenigen die auf mich zuhaus' gewartet hätten
Hab' den ganzen Schmutz aufgesaugt nun schleppe ich
Das dauernd mit mir rum wie einen staubigen Teppich
So perfekt war's vor drei Jahren einfacher kann's nicht gehen
Doch dann musste ich meiner Mum goodbye sagen, Abschied nehmen
Keine Ahnung was los ist ich bin normal
Aber die anderen sind komisch
Denn sowieso bin ich der allerletzte Scheißkerl der winkt
Wenn der letzte Eisberg schmilzt, ein Eisbär ertrinkt
Ich bin dreißig, ein Kind, einfach naiv
Wenn 'ne Seifenblase fliegt für mich reinste Magie
Leider aber lief ich in ein offenes Messer und sah den anderen zu
Beim Spielen durch in ein geschlossenes Fenster

Trauriger Schluss, Märchenbücher bis zur Hälfte lesen

Seltsames Wesen, keine Regeln, nicht eingliedern, mit sich selber Federball spielen Einsiedler

Die Hand ans Keyboard, Taste drücken, lauter Ton
Die viele Arbeit macht verrückt, aber wird kaum belohnt

Ohne Rauchen stoned, Zauberbogen holen, rauf zum Mond
Hab wohl geträumt, wo kommt der Krach her? Ich bin wach jetzt

Der nicht im Bus fährt, 
Sondern eine Runde um die Erde dreht mit nicht mehr als einem Rutschpferd

Große Bühne doch Gefühle keinen Hunni wert
Lügen schmecken süß wie grüne Gummibären
Düsen ab in die Sahara und nie umgekehrt
Mir gezeigt wie man mein Blut wie alte Suppe in den Gulli leert
In Hotelbetten zu schlafen war gestern, 
Der Schlafsack-Polyester ist angesagt von jetzt an

Abgefahren jetzt werden andere ans Licht treten,

Man verirrt sich innen drin und findet nie wieder daraus
Schnee im Winter und im Sommer große Hitze, doch kein Strand
Für immer in der Innenstadt im Spinnennetz gefang'
Dann die Gesichter angespannt und kühl
Ist man schwach wird man ganz sicher an den Straßenrand gespült
Und als gäb' es nichts zu lachen hat man manchmal das Gefühl
Auch der Nachbar ist nur der Typ von nebenan – anonym
Die Stadt die keine Berge hat – Berlin
Nur schwere Herzen und entleerte Batterien
Die Beine schwer, man fährt auf Schienen
Hin und her zwischen voneinander weit entfernten Zielen
Und wieder ist ne Schicht vorbei, die Rechnungen beglichen
Die kitschig heile Welt ist einer hässlichen gewichen
In sämtlichen Fenstern brennt noch Licht
Und dahinter erzählen sich fremde Menschen Geschichten

Es ziehen Stürme auf
Mir geht der Treibstoff aus

Morgens um fünf herrscht schon Lärm
Keine Beschwerden denn so früh werden die Mülltonnen geleert
Aber das dauert nicht ewig und schon bald wird das erledigt sein
Die Glasscherben weggefegt die Gehwege sind besenrein
Die Stadt die keine Liebe kennt, nur mieses Wetter
Durch all den Wind und Hagel fallen die Ziegel von den Dächern
Es gibt auch in der kleinen Stadt Gewalt aber hier
Schmeißt man auch Briefe an den Weihnachtsmann zum alten Papier
Von hier raus aufs Land man atmet durch, daran zerbricht der Kopf
Man kommt auf Atemluft nicht klar und vermisst den Smog
Lieber spaziert man zwischen hohen Gebäuden
Zwischen unfreundlichen Leuten und den Drogenverseuchten
Man muss warten bis ein Wunder passiert
Und bis dahin auf einem Drahtseil über Schluchten balancieren
Und ich selber hab es endlich mal nach 100 Jahren kapiert
Im Dschungel dieser Großstadt verirrt

Denn weg waren die Kumpels und ich kuschelte mit Bären
Keine Herz die Brust leer, Muschel ohne Perlen
Leute, ehrlich tut mir leid ich machte Worte zu fassen
Hab meine ganzen Freunde mit Kacke beworfen, ich Affe
Aber jetzt wird alles besser, mach es jetzt wieder gut
Meine Verfassung nicht mehr wechselhaft wie Ebbe und Flut
Habe mit dreckigen Schuhen auf vielen Nasen getanzt
Nach Jahren gehen die Wunden Weg, aber die Narben nie ganz
Ich war der Bomber der Herzen, der beste gewesen
Manchen weniger getroffen, doch verletzt habe ich jeden
Aber komm schon lasst uns feiern mit Silvester Raketen
Und wir tun mal einfach so als hätte es gestern nie gegeben

Und wieder zum Anfang
Wir halten den Sand an
Vergessen und ich frage dich
Wo warst du? Was los? Wie geht's dir?

Schluss damit, ausgeträumt, bin immer noch hier
Und darum muss ich endlich aufräumen wie mein Zimmer mit vier
Aber alles ist im grünen Bereich die Zeit der Lügen vorbei
Meine Weste frisch gebügelt und weiß
Da war ein kleines bisschen Sand im Getriebe,
Aber ich bin wieder da und versammle gerade alle die ich liebe
Um mich wieder zu versöhnen und verzeiht mir meinen Größenwahn
Es tut mir so unendlich leid wenn ich mal böse war
Gestern wollte ich jeden auf der Erde verfluchen,
Nun kommt von Herzen alles Gute, Kerzen in den Kuchen
Und ab nun klebe ich es wieder zusammen
Und spiele nie wieder die falsche Melodie auf einem Beat ohne Drums
Schon als Kinder von zuhause weg, wir gaben uns die Hand
Was hätte unser Haus gebrannt, gelaufen und gerannt
Und so wurden wir alt, erhielten dem Ansturm nicht stand
Und niemand hielt die Sanduhren an

Die selbe Bar, Zigaretten, Rum und schlechter Wein
Wie ätzend doch der Kater ist, identisch zu den letzten dreien
Keine Action drinnen aber draußen da
Wechselt der Himmel mal die Farbe zwischen blau und schwarz
Seit Jahren dem gleichen Penner Kohle in die Dose schmeißen
Und wenn er spart wird's irgendwann mal für 'ne Cola reichen
Alte Achterbahn, ohne Geschrei ohne Hosen scheißen,
Wird sowieso nicht entgleisen
Und zum millionsten Mal, beiß' ich in 'ne Pizza die nicht heiß ist
Oder Chicken-Rice vom Thai in der Midlife-Crisis

Wolken auf denen man wie auf Watte liegt, die gab es nie
Dank Fantasie war sie keine Matratze die nach Katze riecht
Tatsache ich bin ein großer Mann in Jeans,

Denn ich stand hinter dem Schrank
Und da kam die Sonne nicht durch
Ich war schon immer nur der Schatten einer Comicfigur
Doch ich habe mich bunt angemalt (angemalt)
Und alle rundherum haben mich angestrahlt

Rauf auf das Floß und dann bloß abhauen
Eine Großstadt aufgebaut im Kopf
Doch keine Großmacht, eher Ohnmacht
Übermacht nun über Nacht geflüchtet
Nichts als raus
Schau ich hab mich zwar verflüssigt
Aber wünschte ich wär' Staub
Ab durch die Hintertür, den Wind im Rücken spüren
Er bläßt, den Schlüssel nicht gedreht
Und nicht zurückgelegt, kein Stück bewegt
Bis jetzt, denn jetzt renn' ich wie auf der Jagd nach einem wilden Tier
Zwischen all den Bäumen lass' die Albträume echt hinter mir
Gänsehaut, jetzt endlich gehen die Ketten auf
Letzte Tür, Adventskalender
Yes! Und es steht EXIT drauf!
Vertrautheit war mir fremd
Ich war fast hunderttausend Jahre down
Versteckt hinter'm Gartenzaun: Charlie Brown

Auf der Flucht, renn' und die Ungewissheit schwindet
Tausend Sachen vorgenommen
Doch kaum was davon hingekriegt
Hingelegt und eingeknickt, 'ne Weinschorle vom Pennymarkt
War immer schon ein Trinker und kein Cyborg oder Predator
Selten sah ich mal die eine Seite: Die Gute
Doch nun befrei' ich mich aus einer Zeit, die ich verfluche
Und wenn es sein muss
Werde ich ein kleines Haus aus Karten bauen
Eines ohne Gartenzaun: Charlie Brown

Ich stand hinter dem Schrank

Chakuza,"Geplante Weltreisen wurden ganz ganz schnell mal zu Städtereisen
Am Ende bleibt einem daheim in die Ecke scheißen
Mit 30 wollt ich 'ne Familie und 'n riesen Garten
'Nen riesen Wagen, ich verzweifle an den Leasingraten
Hört mir nicht zu aber Horton hört ein Hu und so
Find ich ja cool und so
Oder auch nicht ich muss ein schlimmes Wort benutzen
Dieser Horton ist ein Hurensohn!
Dann sieh mich an und sag mir was du da siehst
Einen der 'nen anderen nachmacht der eine Spasti in Jeans
Ich seh 'nen Mann der viele seiner Liebsten gehen lassen musste
Und dann darüber gesungen hat, was eh jeder wusste
Ewig lang gefrustet und mit Rauschmitteln getröstet
Ich gehe davon aus, dass auch das Laufen mich tötet
Doch bis dahin gehe ich den Weg der etwas schwierig werden wird
Doch auf Erden große Fresse bis er stirbt

Manchmal denk ich das hier alles eine Drehscheibe wär
Die sich eine Weile lang dreht, dann stehen bleibt, leer
Dann geht hier nichts mehr, also Flasche leer'n
Dann dreht sie sich mehr

Manchmal denk ich das hier alles eine Drehscheibe wär
Die sich eine Weile lang dreht, dann stehen bleibt, leer
Dann geht hier nichts mehr, also Flasche leer'n
Dann dreht sie sich mehr

Viel zu lange unsichtbar, die Schnauze gehalten
Und sich nicht trauen was zu sagen unter traurigen Gestalten
Und nie jemanden ran lassen, das war's dann für gewöhnlich
Was ich anfasse wird Salz, ich war einmal ein König
Falsche Fassade wie ein achso schönes Pärchen
Ich war einmal ein König, das is' 'n ganz altes Märchen
Ich auch und solange abgetaucht und lautlos
Nach all den Jahren abgefuckt wie ein gebrauchtes Auto
Da hilft es auch nicht Sonntags durch den Park zu wandern
Man kann mit mir quatschen, ich bin ganz woanders
Hab' nichts anderes getan außer zu saufen die Tage
Der Masterplan ist geplatzt, Kaugummiblase
Dann renn' ich rum denn der Ruhestand nutzt mir nix
Ruhelos als hätt' ich hundert Dosen Redbull gekippt
Oder am Rum gelugt
Und dann umgekippt

Manchmal denk ich das hier alles eine Drehscheibe wär
Die sich eine Weile lang dreht, dann stehen bleibt, leer
Dann geht hier nichts mehr, also Flasche leer'n
Dann dreht sie sich mehr

Manchmal denk ich das hier alles eine Drehscheibe wär

Hängen bleiben Scherben

Chakuza,"Sag mal, was fragst du mich?
Wie geht's mir wohl?
Irgendwie bin ich am Arsch, diese Sache mit Tränen und so.
Ich dachte immer, niemand kann die Nuss knacken.
Nun hab ich immer wiederkehrende Vermissungsattacken.
Es ist nicht mehr als ne beschissene Schnitzeljagd
Immer hinter dir herzurennen. Sagt wer bist du denn? Fick dich ma, fuck!
Erst mal die Wand anstarren, manchmal mit Tieren reden.
Bettlaken riechen so, als wärst du grad noch hier gewesen.
Das macht mir eh nichts aus, das kann jeder sagen.
Am Ende des Tages hab ich 'n heftigen Leberschaden.
Jedes Mal wenn etwas Wichtiges richtig ist, dann verliert man es.
Dann wird der ganze Kitsch was Bitteres, was Wirkliches.

Irgendwann ham wir nur teillos uns zum Leben genommen.
Uns getrennt und weggerannt, unter die Räder gekommen.
Bei uns war's dunkel, mal hell

Ey, hab was geschrieben, Süße, egal ob's gefällt.
Briefmarke dran und schöne Grüße vom Arsch der Welt.
Endlich mal ich selbst sein, nicht böse sein und verrückt.
Denn bis jetzt hab ich das größte Schwein in mir drin unterdrückt.
Aber es fehlt jemand, der mich im Zaum hält.
Es fehlt ein Baustein, beschädigte Traumwelt.
Nicht nur beschädigt, sondern mehr als zerstört.
Nun bin ich ledig und muss täglich was von Aerosmith hören.
Und hab den ganzen Tag lang nur schnulzigen Schlager im Ohr.
Also war's nur warme Luft, unser Indianer-Ehrenwort.
Und ab nun mach ich was Dummes, etwas Doffes, was Dämliches,
Wie Huf, von nun an laber ich den Blues oder was Ähnliches.

Irgendwann ham wir nur teillos uns zum Leben genommen.

Bei uns war's dunkel, mal hell, mal dunkel, mal hell
Und alles Rundherum zu schnell.

Irgendwie ist das Ganze voll aus dem Ruder gelaufen.
Die Luft ist raus, hab kaum noch Puste um kurz unterzutauchen.
Irgendwie ist es besser wenn unsre Wege sich trennen.
Wir sparen uns das Reden, mach's gut und wir sehen uns, bis denne.

Irgendwann ham wir nur teillos uns zum Leben genommen.

Chakuza,"Es macht mich krank immer so lange und auch ständig auf den Zug zu warten.
Pause aus Zwang, aber zu Haus verwelkt der Blumengarten.
Ich kann nichts machen, doch ich hasse es
Und meine Hände wachsen auch wie alte Essensreste in den Taschen fest.
Nachts im Wald, am Tag auf Straßen hin und her zu schlendern,
Als wär ich ein schwachsinniges Pferd auf ner Carrera-Rennbahn.
Nachts wird sich gewälzt im Bett, doch sicher nicht beim Liebemachen.
Meine Liebste ist die, die mir zusieht, um sich schief zu lachen.
Die Batterie die wär dann immer in Betrieb.
Mein Herz hat viel mehr Energie als kleine Meerschweinchen auf Speed.
Rausgehen, Trinken, Miete futsch. Austicken, weil mieser Druck.
Auch wieder viel zu viel geschluckt, nach Hause auf den Knien gerutscht.

Wo ich mich hinbeweg, was aus meinem Leben wird,
Klar, wo ich auch hingeh, dass es Gegenwind geben wird.
Wo auch immer ich hin muss, der Windmühle entgegen, 
Ich hab immer nen Windschutz.

Doch plötzlich geht einem der Saft aus, wie Druckerpatronen.
Was für ein kraftraubender Akt, um für Kaffee Zucker zu holen.
In der Schlange anstehen fühlt sich an wie im Supermarkt zu wohnen, ehrlich.
Ja, aber für mich ist es nie gut gewesen. 
Im Kerzenlicht ein Buch, es ist schon schwer genug die Juice zu lesen.
Husch, husch und auch wenn alles fertig ist nie Ruhe geben.
Als wär ich Merlins Zauberlehrlings verfluchter Besen.
Schaff ich das, trotz Rückenschmerzen, nicht ganz so verrückt zu werden.
Job kündigen und überkopf Matratze von ner Brücke werfen.
Nicht daneben stehen, doch wie ein Kreuzfahrtschiff anlegen, im Bremerhaven.
Sich bei jemand anlehnen und schlafen.

Wo ich mich hinbeweg, was aus meinem Leben wird,
Klar, wo ich auch hingeh, dass es Gegenwind geben wird.

Ein bisschen Zeit könnt ich gebrauchen, um mich aufzuwärmen, 
Dann fällt mir einen ganzen Marathon zu laufen auch nicht schwer.
Ich hab geträumt ein Astronaut zu werden, Raumschiff leer.
Mein ganzes Haus steht leer und ein Auto brauch ich auch nicht mehr.

Chakuza,"Ich mag keine Partys, und weiß nicht was damals bei ABBA lief
Aber geht's mir mies, dann tanzt mein Herz wie ein Gabbafreak
Unendliche und nächtelange Tänze zum Sprechgesang
Zu starke Getränke, danach noch Tage im Bett gefangen
Fußballwetten, auf die Falschen gewettet
Weg ist das Geld, bis auf die alten Schuhe, alles verpfändet
Das hat uns allen bloß ein Lächeln gekostet
Unter dreckiger Wäsche, die Dosen aus Blech, von Pepsi verrostet
Und wir hängen ständig am Ostbahnhof, Sonne brennt, doch im Park ist kühl
Wenn der Magen sich meldet, schnell zu McDonalds, ein Sparmenü
Wie üblich kann der Tag erst mal ab Mittags beginnen
Alles andere ergibt keinen Sinn
Ist schon toll, wir haben nichts doch führ'n ein glückliches Leben
Es interessiert uns wahrlich nicht was andere über uns reden
Sich durch die Wüste bewegen, das überlass den Kamelen
Wir laufen lachend durch die Gegend ohne Tage zu zählen

Denn wir hängen einfach so rum
wir hängen einfach so rum
Kein wieso, kein warum

Und auf den Bauplänen steht, dass es so nicht mehr lange bleibt
Was auch immer hier dann hinkommt, es wird ein Friedhof sein
Und unser wunderschönes Leben, passt in fünf kleine Kartons
Doch ohne uns ist das alles hier, nur Glas und Beton

Wir tragen alles in uns was wir haben und sammeln mal hier mal da
Um dann bis zum Abend für 'nen Kasten voll Bier zu sparen
Keiner von uns will vor Regen schutz, unter Dächern wohnen
Leben 'Over The Rainbow', Marusha's Technoversion
Wer hat es denn nicht gemacht? Papa Geld aus der Tasche klau'n
Oder manches mal beim Nachbarn, ein paar Äpfel vom Apfelbaum
Und manchmal gibt es nichts zu lachen, kein bisschen lächeln
Das Picknick kannste vergessen, kein bisschen da um zu essen
Aber alles kein Stress, solang es die Möwen nicht finden
Dann fallen irgendwann für uns auch ein paar Brötchen vom Himmel
Und alles böse verschwindet, die Traurigen trösten sich gegenseitig
Endlich weiß ich auch, wie es ist, wenn das Leben nicht leicht ist
Jeder begreift, dass es dir ma' nicht um die Kohle geht
Denn um Kohle zu scheffeln, ist es für mich sowieso zu spät
So oft mal fröhlich sein, trotz zerflossenem Lebenstraum
Lieber jahrelang mal gar nichts, als auf rostigen Nägeln kau'n

Denn wir hängen einfach so rum
wir hängen einfach so rum
Kein wieso, kein warum

Keine Ringe unter den Augen, kein Feinstaub in den Lungen
Arme Stadt sitzt jetzt grade in Hemd und Krawatte gezwungen
Stellt sich dem Wecker, bleibt nicht mehr Wach ohne Grund
Auf ihrem schwedischen Sofa, ist jetzt kein Platz mehr für uns

Nie nach Gold, nur nach Silber fischen

Kein vollgeschwitztes Kissen - Wow, da is'n Unterschied

Was'n Abturn, ich muss wieder nach unten klettern, da alle grade wach werden

Ein Leben geführt
Ein von viel Musik beeinflusstes
Voller Modenschau’n und Krach

Zu viel gereist
Zu viel geweint und unzählige Shows
Eine tägliche Soap, ist unser tägliches Brot
Erzählungen vom Tod oder vom wirklichen Leben
Ich sag nur Amen ohne in die Kirche zu gehen
Denn ich habs überlebt mit mehr Glück als Verstand
Und dem verdammten Tattoo auf dem Rücken der Hand
Steh mit dem Rücken zur Wand
Aber das nur um nicht umzufalln'

Ich bin mein eigenes Zugpferd

Wie eine Einweihnungsfeier aber du störst
Der Kreis wird bei weitem nicht reichen für'n U-Turn
Rießiges Boot oder sinkendes Floss
Stimme zu tief für nen Engel
Der Himmel zu hoch
Nach außen hin kleiner Bengel, innen drin groß
Doch ich hab immernoch
Nicht vergessen wo ich herkam mit der ?
Die besten zehn Jahre wenn die letzten sechs auch schwer waren
Etwas zuviel Erde im Schubkarren
Als ich von unten aus der Ferne noch den Sternschnuppen zusah
Zuviele Aasgeier die durch die Gegend schwirren
Und ich steh unter einem Wasserfall mit Regenschirm
Ich dachte grenzenlos wäre die Liebe aber das hier ist das letzte Konzert das ich spiele

Was soll ich den erzählen, jap - den Mann im Spiegel gibts nicht
Komm frag mich ob ich Fit bin
Alter, eigentlich Banane
Manchmal fühl ich mich so steif, als hät ich eingegipste Arme
Das mit Reisen klappt nicht so, weil mir die Patte fehlt zum Fliegen
Ich fahr Slalom auf den Skiern, durch den Acker voller Mienen
Und dann steh ich an den Schienen eines stehgelegten Bahnhofs
Alle Flammen sind erstickt, riesiger Drache aber Zahnlos

Und dann lasse ich die Bilder von den Wänden fallen
Mein selbstgemaltes Ende halt
Sprenge das Gebäude ich bin fertig mit den Träumen

In meinem Kopf herrscht des getrampel einer Sambatänzerin
Oder mich richtig hasse, denn es ist ein nicht endender Kampf
Der verdammte Griff zur Flasche und das nicht wegen dem Pfand
Das war mal anders, ich bin tagelang nur traurig, früher nicht
Denn ich hab so viel Mist gebaut, der nicht mehr auszubügeln ist
Und dann taucht es wieder auf, wie in nem Fluss versenkte Leiche
Irgendeiner kommt, bezeichnet dich als Schwuchtel oder Scheiße

Ich fühl´ mich schwer, als wär´ ich Fernfahrer nach tagelangem Stau
Könnt´ ich Traurigkeit verkaufen wär´ ich Multimillionär
Doch ich schieb´ dauernd einen großen Haufen Bullshit hin und her
Ich kann die firlefanz Musik schon nicht mehr hören, doch hör sie trotzdem
Blas mir irgendwann den Kopf weg wie ein Selbstmörder-Maskottchen
Und natürlich such ich Gold, denn nach unendlichen Versuchen
Hängt der Wolf vor meinem Haus rum und ist ständig nur am pusten

Niemals Zeit für die Romanzen, sie verliefen sich im Sand

Nun wirkt es so als wären wir nach den ganzen Jahren wieder schüchtern
Wir haben beide unsere Jobs, alles in trockenen Tüchern
Doch ich ertrag das nicht mehr, weder stockbesoffen noch nüchtern
Denn es ist nicht so, dass wir zwei an Problemen nicht genügend hätten
Lief nicht so wie diese Liebesfilme oder -bücher enden

Und am Ende ist es so, dass immer bleibt, was immer Hoffnung war
Denn einer von uns fällt wie beim Duell zum ersten Glockenschlag
Ist doch so, dass wir nach dieser Zeit im Stress mal Ruhe brauchen
Da hilft es auch nicht, einfach Eis essen und Schuhe kaufen
Wenn so viel Wasser fließt, bricht irgendwann der Damm
Erst ein Hoch und dann ein Tief, ein ziemlich mieses Diagramm
Dann platzte uns der Kragen, eine traurige Riesenbombe
Der Grund warum ich manchmal nachts die Augen nicht schließen konnte
Das mit uns ging schief und ich bekenne mich schuldig
Denn das Ding mit Ying und Yang ist auch letztendlich nur Bullshit

Und auch in 40 Jahren
Wird es sich anfühlen als wenn's 14 waren

Irgendwann kracht's, bleibt kein Stein auf dem andern

Schmetterlinge weg und nichts außer Kopfweh

Vom besoffenen Peter und dem Hiroshima Mädchen

Keine Autos, nein, wo aus dem Schornstein der Rauch aufsteigt
Rushhourverbot, der Sonntagmorgen einer Pause gleicht
So steht man hier, das Abenteuer kann beginnen
Geh heut spazieren, fotografier die Nadelbäume wie die Sphinx
Ein Alltag zwischen schwarzen Katzen, Bienen und Hummeln
Lass in der Großstadt all die brummenden Kaffeemaschinen verstummen

Actionsplatter oder Liebesfilm
Verdrahtete Fesseln, die Arme abschnüren
Haltlos abstürz, ich bin Fallschirm
Achtung Falltür!
Woanders gelandet und Sonne getankt
Die Nacht voller Smog, Monster im Schrank
Ein riesiges Moor und tiefer Sand
New York Citys Niemandsland
Goldene Elfen, Revolverhelden
Wolf im Schafspelz, Wolkenfelder
Rockefeller
Kirche im Dorf, sahen Gespenster
Graslose Wiesen, glaslose Fenster
Fotoalben, schwarz gerändert
Schwarze Masken, alles Gangster
So oft der Clown, doch lachen wir später
Vom Täter zum Opfer - acht Millimeter

Alles gar nicht wahr, alles nur Fantasien

Chakuza,"Schon immer gegen Mauern oder Türen gerannt
Wir waren mal traurig und danach sauer, junge Tyrannen
So oft zu dumm für das Spiel und darum bei so vielen unbeliebt
Liefen als junge Diebe wohin der Hunger uns trieb
Wollten was richtiges machen doch hatten kein blassen Dunst
Gott hat uns Lichter erschaffen, aber noch gar keine Kunst
Aber noch gar keine Kunst
Wir kehrten um, ha'm uns gewehrt aber kassierten noch mehr Schläge
Standen wie die Zwerge in riesigen, leeren Konzertsälen
Verzweifelt, gehofft, man gab uns nur keine Chance
Die Zeit ist uns davongelaufen, ?

Alles bleibt wie es ist
Kein Weg führt zurück
Wenn die Uhr tickt

Alles bleibt wie es ist
Kein Weg führt zurück

Unsere handersparten Pumas durch die Schuhsohlen latschen
Die erste Show auf dem Schulhof, danach am Fußboden schlafen
Dann war die Bahn davongefahr'n aber egal, ob man den Tag verpennt hat
Damals war'n wir für uns echte Stars vor'm Panoramafenster
Vollkommene Euphorie und was man heute sieht ist was von diesem goldgelockten Teufel blieb
Der Teufel schlief, wir wollten haben was sich jeder wünscht
Was aufs Sparbuch legen und entspannt 'nen schwarzen Tee um 5
? sind die Ränder des Brotes
Denn anscheinend wird man erst wertvolle Legende, wenn man tot ist
Doch wir fürchten wirklich keinen, lasst uns die Zeit in die Länge zieh'n
Und das Glühwürmchen nur einmal so hoch steigen wie'n Zeppelin

Alles bleibt wie es ist
Kein Weg führt zurück
Wenn die Uhr tickt

Alles bleibt wie es ist
Kein Weg führt zurück
Wenn die Uhr tickt

Wir hatten keinen Plan von gar nichts
Für uns klangen die Gitarren besser
Unterhalb der Chartspitze und uralten Garagendächern
Wagten's nicht zu denken doch ham's immer gehofft
Tragen die Rosa Brille oft, weil's mehr Bock macht als die ""Stille Post""
Alles war uns fremd, eine erfolglose Band von vielen
Wollten nie Geld verdienen mit den neugespielten Melodien
Auf einmal hat's gekracht und über Nacht wurde das Ganze real
Die Welt, die uns umgab, so fabelhaft wie die von Amélie

Alles bleibt wie es ist
Kein Weg führt zurück
Wenn die Uhr tickt

Alles bleibt wie es ist
Kein Weg führt zurück
Wenn die Uhr tickt",Vorhang
Chakuza,"Wir waren schon immer nur die zweite Geige spielend
Die dann am Spielende noch streiten an der Seitenlinie
Keiner deiner Lieblingsrapper, die die Kette verlieren
Nur Männer die nach sechzehn Bier die Etiketten verlieren
Wir stehen noch vor den Bullen Schmiere
Haben statt Waffen 'ne Familie oder Tiere, degradierte Offiziere
Und gibt es Streit, kann auch Weihnachten beschissen sein
Auf die Lippen beißen, küssen keinen unterm Mistelzweig
Lange nicht gesehen, ziehen gemeinsam durch die Clubs
Trinken alles, was noch reinkann, bis zum Schluss, es muss
Und wenn alle Städte leer sind, erst dann hören wir auf
Es muss nicht einmal das Meer sein, wir surfen auf der Couch

Und da wir uns nach all den Jahren wiedererkennen
Können wir all die nie geschriebenen Briefe verbrennen
Denn echte Freundschaft ist teuer
Ein Diamant geschliffen durch Wassersturmfeuer

Uns interessiert, Mannschaft gut oder verliert
Und nicht dieses verfluchte Tagebuch eines Vampirs
Fangen an, zu musizieren wie ein Orchester voller Kinder
Wir spielen kein Klavier, es ist besser, nur zu klimpern
Erst Handy an und fragen „Sag, was labern die Idioten da?“
Die alten Geschichten zum abermillionensten Mal
Von all den üblen Zeiten und den lustigen Tagen
Von den harten Prügelei'n und unsern blutigen Nasen
Sieh, die Jahre vergehen, es gibt viel zu erzählen
Es macht Spaß, sich als Riesenbabys wiederzusehen
Sieh ma', denn heute sind wir Rapper oder Ärzte mit bekannten Namen
Und dann machten wir klar, wie man der stärkste in der Bande war

Und da wir uns nach all den Jahren wiedererkennen
Können wir all die nie geschriebenen Briefe verbrennen
Denn echte Freundschaft ist teuer
Ein Diamant geschliffen durch Wassersturmfeuer

Fotoalbum raus ? vergangenen Nacht durchschauen
Erst die alte, kaputte Vase zusammenbauen
Ach zum Teufel hier hat keiner mal Kunst studiert
Freundschaften, Feindschaften, die alt sind, aber funktionieren
Noch stehen wir hier, aber die kurze Zeit ist immer gut
Mit unseren ausgebleichten schlimmeren Tattoos
Was passiert, ist nur aus Liebe oder blinder Wut
Ist ein in Blindenschrift geschriebenes Kinderbuch",Wassersturmfeuer

So als würd’ ich mich in „Walking Dead“ und „Zombieland“ befinden
Ist kein königlicher Sonntag, denn der Vibe in meinem Bungalow
Ist einfach viel zu dunkel und bedrohlich - leider unheroisch
Schrecklich ist der Morgen für das ungeliebte Stiefkind
Kommt mir vor als würden LKW-Motoren für mich ein Lied singen
Und mein Mädchen wird zum Biest, war vorher Liebling, es gibt Streit
Denn ich beherrsche sie ganz gut, die Kunst der Mittelmäßigkeit
Einer, der den Kopf gern in die Salzlake steckt
Während für andere der Tag wie ’n Berg aus Baklava schmeckt

Wieder gibt’s nur mich und meinen Koffer unterm Arm

Er ist tatsächlich da, der unendlich lange schwarze Tag
Depris, Trauer, Tränen - eine schreckliche Ménage-à-trois
Und plötzlich fängt eine Kapelle an zu spielen
Man hört Musik durch diese blechernen Lamellen der Jalousien
Wie oft hat mir der Kopf das schon verziehen?
Ich denke oft, ich fiel als Kind in einen Topf voll Aspirin
Die Arme müde und die Hanteln, die sind richtig schwer
Tag der lahmen Ente, nicht verdammt wütender Grizzlybär
Und am Abend ist der Dampfer tief im Meer versunken, dann
Ist wieder alles gut, die mieseste der Sternstunden vergangen

Chalee Tennison,"She was waitin' tables in a diner off of Highway 41
On his way to Indiana on another midnight run
So they talked about the weather and the next thing that you know
The hours flew by like minutes and it was time he had to go
On a rainy highway half way out of town 
A voice inside his heart said turn those 18 wheels around
 
And go back
You've got somebody waitin'
Go back
That's where you need to be 
Right now
There's nothing in this world more important than that
So go back
 
They settled down in a little house in the spring of '92
And she quit her job at the diner with the baby almost due
Those early years weren't easy and they had bills to pay
So he said you know I hate to leave you but I'll be back by Saturday
10 miles out of Tulsa his boss came on his radio
Said if you want to see your brand new daughter you better drop that load
 
And go back
You've got somebody waitin'
Go back
That's where you need to be 
Right now
There's nothing in this world more important than that
So go back
 
Everybody heard the sirens
They pulled his rig out of the snow
In a rush to see his family somehow he lost control
Though the doctors tried to save him, he slipped into the light
Then he heard the angels whisper, now is not your time 
 
Go back
You've got somebody waitin'
Go back
That's where you need to be 
Right now
There's nothing in this world more important than that
So go back
(You've got somebody waitin')

I might kick up my heels all night

I might even make you blush

I still remember our last kiss
And just how sweet it was
How he acted like he didn't care
Oh, but I know he still does
And right before he said goodbye
He took off his ring
Said, ""I don't need this anymore""
Oh, but that don't mean a thing

One a step at a time.

I know I'm gonna find a place,
To rest this weary soul,
Leave all the heartaches and tears behind,
An' get off this lonesome road.

So I'll be walkin' with tunnel vision,
To keep my mind off lookin' back.
'Cause fallin' for the wrong one,
Is what led me down this path.
But my day is comin' soon, mountains are in my rear view.
Already made it through the hardest part.
Nothin's gonna slow me down till I reach that sacred ground,
Won't be too long now.

I know I'm gonna find a place,
To rest this weary soul,
Leave all the heartaches and tears behind,
An' get off this lonesome road.

Someday I'll lay down those memories.
Feel, the sun on my face and the freedom under my feet.

Lookin' down two long lonely paths

And believe every fight uphill is worth it
Every teardrop has a purpose
It just clears your eyes to see
Believe storms don't last forever
What don't kill you just makes you better

We say, we say so much that we regret
And we leave so much unspoken
Still we can't see what's missing

As they cry out in the dar
Why can't we just stop and listen

Flew a white Continental with the top laid back

Dust blowin' out of those well wore tracks

Old folks watchin' from a rockin' chair
Ain't no place for a girl of her state

Got that little suitcase in your hand

I finally hit the border and Mexico was all there was

As I crossed that river the sun was settin'
But I started seein' the light
I walk those streets and I talked to myself
And I decided I would be all right
I drank some Tequila
I said, who needs you
I don't have to do this alone
Me and Mexico are lettin' you go

I bought a big sombrero and made me laugh
Funny I don't think we were ever happy like that
Country full of strangers a thousand miles from home
The first time in a long time that I have felt alone

I couldn't understand the words but singing right out loud

Down here sipping lean, that's that purple stuff
Staying thoed getting bucked, playas living it up
Game spitters riding big, is a habit y'all
Everything you dream about, we done had it y'all
We got money yellow hoes, wearing g-string clothes
Sport sweaters in the summer, cause our necks stay froze
Gripping grain having change, hanging low as your belt
If you want to be a man, go and get it yourself
Down here we do it all, break laws and ball
Ghetto stars for the cause, either stand or fall
We live it up cause we love it, playa deal with that
Tite getting it how I live, keep it real with that

[Chorus: x2]

Down South, yeah we ride on dubs
Abuse them drugs, and hoes don't get no love
We just some thugs, with ice that glow and glisten
In a six hundred Benz, and the top is missing
Sit back and listen, cause what I'm saying is real
From Houston to Huntsville, boys got ice in grills
We love to chill, and ride on candy paint
Sip on drank, and blow on that stanky dank
Down South, we known as that Dirty Dirty
If you got your money right, I got them birdy birdies
They going for thirty, yeah you heard me clear
And if you didn't know nigga, that's how we do it down here

Down here, we be off the chain
Down here, we roll foreigns and wide frames
Down here, riding on dubs and 4 swanging
We staying iced up, from the heel to the brain

DJ Screw, mayne put a M down South
So I pay cost to be the boss, keep a time out in the crime house
We thoed we hold it down, wait for bidness no pleasure
This game is serious, ask M-J-G he'll tell you
Stay fired blowing big, sipping on a daily basis
I got better with my cheddar, I'm bout stacking my faces
It's the scrambling we gon handle em, living the best out our figgas
And if I'm lying we be draping choose my son, you tripping
When that Don from six, man I'm still a G to the N
I'm staying fly cause you smile, showing love to my kin
For shizzle my nizzle, from here McGregor we swang and bang
And in Peru hotting dudes, chopping by is from the fame
The girls best friend, princess cuts in everything
You know what's his name, and I take a half and a chain
This a down South patriot, and you know I won't stop

Tal vez fue por castigo de Dios

Chalk FarM,"So you come to see me now 
When I'm trying to work it out 
Say you sort of felt somehow 
You want to help 
So you spent some time alone 
He didn't want you anyhow 
So you thought it out and now 
You're back to stay and you'll change 

And I don't believe you care 
And I don't believe you will 
And I don't believe there is anything 
You might say that can repair 
And I don't believe you will 
And I don't believe you care 
And I don't believe you'll hear anything 
In this song I'm saying 

Time is on my side 
And I like to be alone 
And it matters what we hide 
I'm not your home 
Will you ever know 

And I don't believe you care 
And I don't believe you will 
And I don't believe there is anything 
You might say that can repair

",Hey
Chalk FarM,"    
How many times have you taken advice from a man who hates? 
Seemingly selfishless sentiments hiding his war paint 
How many nights have you laid awake fearing the next crusade 
Did you sleep well last night 
What will it take? 

The clock on the wall it sees everything 
And I worry 'bout it 'cause 
It's tick tick ticking opn 
It's just ticking away 
And I wake 
And I want to say 
That I'm done with the sleeping 
And all is fine 
And I wake and 
I'm standing here 
If it's not a dream 
Then I can't believe 
That I'm awake 
 
I see a place where the houses are all just exactly alike 
All of the cars are one color and there's only one type 
Each has the same dog and same cat and same fucking tank of fish 
Dinner's the same time and all the same dish 

The clock on the wall it sees everything 
And I worry 'bout it 'cause 
It's tick tick ticking opn 
It's just ticking away 
And I wake 
And I want to say 
That I'm done with the sleeping 
And all is fine 
And I wake and 
I'm standing here 
Waiting for the day 
When we open our eyes 
And I wake 
And it seems to me 
That's it's all or it's nothing 
Are we so blind 
And I say 
Hey is it time to see 
This is not a dream 
And I can't believe that I'm awake 

How many times have you taken advice from a man who hates? 
Did you sleep well last night

",I'm Awake
Chalk FarM,"So I'm high again 
And I'm looking at my only friend in you 
And you're high too 
Does it sound unreal 
That my house is full 
Of nothing I can feel 
I look for some direction and I find 
A woman who won't reach me 
And a man 
I ask him what it means 
And he says 
It's up to you 
Johnny you must do 
What you have to do 
And he said 
It's up to you 
Johnny do what's right 
But do for you 

So I crashed the car 
And I turn up loud my old guitar and play 
Some Ramones or Hendrix thing 
'Cause it seems to me 
That all I see 
Is that you didn't mind a thing 
And all I say just goes right through 
Have you seen my lonely days 
Do you know 
I wouldn't be like you 
. 
And he says 
It's up to you 
Johnny you must do 
What you have to do 
And he said 
It's up to you 
Johnny do what's right 
But do for you 

So I'm high again 
And I'm looking at my empty bed it's strange 
I can't feel a thing 
Though the lights are low 
The candles on my coffin 
Let me know 
The woman cries for her I know 
How come you never heard me 
Oh man How come you'd never see 
You'd just say 
It's up to you 
Johnny you must do 
What you have to do 
And he said 
It's up to you 
Johnny do what's right 
What I did 
I did for you

Chalk FarM,"Any town, any day, the separation's real
And I find it is based on nothing
Passed from father to son
Mothers to their girls enough
And I fall once again from my own ideals
And I fight back the fear of something
That I don't understand
But learned when I was young
And I know that it's strange
I know that it's strange

And I think it will take us more than legislation
I think it will take us more than filling graves
And I say that you can not force appreciation
Lie on lie

I will not run away from the battle now
If it seems that's the way I'm fighting
I will just pass away the pieces of my life
'cause I know that it's right, I know that it's right

And I think it will take us more than legislation
I think it will take us more than filling graves

And I wonder

Beyond my reach but 
I can't give up until it's mine

Everywhere I go and there was some part of me
Thirteen thirteen was, hookers and hoes 
On 11th avenue sellin bodies for dope (Whoa)

She want to party and have fun
Can you hear me baby?
Speak to me baby

[Chorus]
It gets wild when I'm loving my man
I go nuts when he's whipping my ass
Oh, you know I love it like dat
Come on daddy, give it to me like dat
It gets wild when he's pulling my hair
I go nuts when he's touching me there
Oh, you know I love it like dat
Don't stop daddy do it like dat

When woman decide when she ready fi di ride
Yu caan come quick 
Where's yu pride?
Pressure must be applied
Like when two car collide
Gal fi get dick till she clide
Sen it on and she cried
When man done gal go hide
Said that was nice but I lied
As god a my guide
Yuh got to believe me, I tried
To be gentle but she replied

Cham,"The road to success is not straight 
Theres a curve called failure 
A loop called confusion 
Speed bumps called friends 
And red lights called enemies 
Caution signs called family 
And flat tires called jobs 
But if you have a spare called determination 
And a engine called perseverance 
With insurance called faith 
And the drive to make it 
Youll reach a place called success (can u hear me?)

Man a ghetto youth for life (yo!)

I can, not forget where I come from 
No mount a money cyaa change man 
Still blaze the skunk 
But some leave the ghetto get rich & turn punk 
But I won't forget my roots cause I don't 
Worship money that's not what counts 
Kill or be killed 
Somehow I have to buy mama house pon di hill (because) 

I've been through struggles & wars 
I man survive it with just a few scars 
Nuff man dead some gone behind bars 
Suh right now real ghetto youths dont fear police cars 
Experience teaches knowledge 
I graduate from the the street side collage 
Back when the whole a wi a share one sausage 
Suh every now & then mi send back a package (weh Cham seh)

Some man mek it an a live a better life 
An don't recall the days when we a walk wid knife 
A simple argument bring strife, 
Some man a diss dem babymada fi dem uptown wife 
Dem a front but I have my doubt 
Si dem in the club a flash cash all about 
A pose like thug when in fact dem a scout 
Cause dem never look back dem rich & sellout

When I was small & growing up 
If we cooked then Paul is showing up 
Paul left town since then he's blowing up 
Now him buy Benz him nuh remember him frenz (but)

Broad daylight like round 12 o'clock 
Him come pon di corner wid him little fake act 
And from him turn millionaire him neva give nutt'n back

Desgarran el alma
Cala los huesos
El agua lo arrastra sin esperanza

La impotencia en su garganta
Con sabor a sal
Una bocanada de aire
Les roba otra oportunidad

Tanta injusticia me desespera
Ponte tú en su lugar
El miedo que sus ojos refleja
La mar se eso a llorar

Muxos no llegan
Se hunden sus sueños

De la montaña

Me rodeaste
Me acunaste en tus brazos
Convirtiéndonos en uno
En un corazón cercano

Un manantial de vida
Con cada beso

Espuma blanca de tus manos
El viento que mece tus sueños

Que no soy capaz ya ni de retenerlo
Será que tengo miedo, miedo, miedo

Será, será, será, será

Intento poner orden dentro de mi cabeza
Quiero volar, volar muy alto volar
Y poder cantar, lanzar al aire la pena

Será que te escondes, será que te pierdo
Que no soy capaz ya ni de retenerlo
Será que tengo miedo, miedo, miedo

Good enough of a reason to feel loved. 
Something we never talked about and you'd never explain, is how you got to where you are with someone else's name; and I ought to hate you by now but I can't give up on you. 
October's at the storm door coloring the lawn, and I'm in a strange house with a girl I hardly know but she'd have to tear down the sky to be as cool as you. 
I don't want to hear you, don't want to see your face, but if you were here right now I'd ask you to stay. I been on your mind, guess that's good enough. 
Good enough of a reason to feel loved. 
(I guess that's good enough) It's six in the morning. 
I'm waiting on a friend, waiting for that sun to come slipping in. 
I swear it's always been lonely wherever I was. 
But now I got ladies looking after me; there's a new dress in the kitchen where yours used to be. 
I feel like whoever I was, I ain't that man no more.",Good Enough
Chamberlain,"Lord, lord, what you got in store for me? 
You gotta give me your word that this boy won't bleed. 
With arms too short to box with you; what's your plan? 
Tell me and I'll follow through...
Why am I the last one to know? 
I built up a temple inside with words inscribed over the door ""I'm right"". 
And one night I invited you in for awhile, and when you walked out the whole place came down...
But why am I the last one to know? 
Why am I always the last one to know? 
I don't like the sound of my heart breaking down. 
It seems the more I've searched, in the end the less I've found. 
The harder I try to be right, I get it wrong every time. 
Wherever my heart goes, I'm the last one to know. I'm lost. 
Lord, I'm lost...my last deal gone down, and I'm the last to know how. 
But, somehow, I'll make you proud of me the way you're proud of the moon and the sea...

Chamberlain,"Sun on the hillsides, the river tells the trains to ride on, like they're racing that going sun. 
The main drag knocks along, summer dames take their dresses for a walk down on the courthouse lawn; and I walk the long mile of the exile, I guess I always will. 
Now the sun slides on the westside down behind the hills. 
It's been a lonesome song of a day. 
I'd just as soon dodge the moon as I'd try and dodge the thought of you, everyday's a song and you're the proof. It wasn't so long ago when you put me out of doors with nothing but a suitcase full of poems. 

You said I was sunlight at midnight...a poet with the sea on my lips. 
You said my life rhymes with the lonesome lines that drip from my fingertips. 
It's been a lonesome song of a day. There's a book I been meaning to write, about how my words are the proof that I'm alive, but it would take me ten lifetimes. 
So until I lay down for good, I'm gonna live each day the way I should, like it's the best song I've ever heard. You said I was sunlight at midnight...a poet with the sea on my lips. 
And now the sun slides on the westside down behind the hills. 
And it's a lonesome song of a day.",Lonesome Song
Chamberlain,"Strange voices calling me back home. 
I should not have come here alone. 
I called you from the station, the hands of your voice reached through the phone, 
saying ""what took you so long."" 

This is the last train out, I'm gonna ride it. 
When I get back to you we'll sit out back just like we used to, sit quietly trading eyes. 
We'll stay up for nights on end, you know we always outlived the lamplight
We'll get up and do it all again, again, and again. 

This is the last train out, I'm gonna ride it. 
Tonight a world is stretched out between us, before long we'll be laughing in the same room. 
All this pain will be a world away when all is said and done. 
My mind's on the tracks through the fields, and my heart is racing speed and steam. 

My soul is waking up out of a long-haul dream. 
I don't care how rough the track is. I'll cross bridges as they're falling down. 
There's no circumstance that can keep me away from you, no rainstorm I won't pull through.

You like long conversations with me under moonlight.
You like the way I look in black.
You say I'm smooth as glass.
You like it all and that's enough for this kid, I guess.
you've got a mountain of a heart.
You took a train ride straight through Illinois and found yourself alone.
The Midwest ain't no place for a queen, but I'm here so it?s home.
I've heard it said you can measure a man by the company he keeps.
If that's true, girl, I'm telling you, I must be a king.
You left town at dawn with your bags full of clothes and that old busted down car.
You spent three days and three nights just to show up at my front door.
you've got a mountain of a heart.
You like cigarettes in the morning even though you smoked a pack last night.
You like long conversations with me; you say they make you feel alive.

Lets be off tonight
While we're awake enough to drive

By this time tomorrow, we'll be alive

Yea, you're reading me lines from a song your wrote
It was something about a dragon of a girl you knew
That you lost on this road to hell

With me

Call it fate or bad luck
Nothing mystifies us
I bet you'll be the last star
Shot down

While my hearts workin' edge

Chamberlain,"You're laid out like a landscape on the frontier of my floor. 
In the next room the girls are singing, they must be wondering where you are. 
Who'd have thought girl, late last spring, we'd still be the same? 
You let your hands fall over my eyelids, vaguely imitating rains. 
If the sky falls tonight... 

We'll all run outside and catch stars in the streetlight. 
I can't argue with you, like I can't argue with the blues that this night has put on. 
Down the hallway you move less like a woman and more like a song. 
Everyone's asleep now. 

This house breathes somehow, the radio plays low. 
And as you leave I know, wherever you go, flowers must follow. 
If the sky falls tonight... We'll all run outside and catch stars in the streetlight. 
Please, don't run out on me. I'll make it through the night if you're here by my side. 
Please, don't run out on me. If the sky falls tonight... 
We'll all run outside and catch stars in the streetlight. (Don't keep me waiting).",Stars in the Streetlight
Chamberlain,"I haven't smiled in a long time but I've learned how to look impressed, learned to lose the dreams I had when I was at my best. 
When I was a boy on the back lawn, faith, like a gun, I'd find and be it loaded or not I'd keep it at my side. 
This voice inside keeps saying: ""congratulations on what you've done, on all you are and all that you won't become.
"" But even when it's hard I guess I'm never where I don't belong and I'll get there by knowning I'd get there all along. This life to me it's like a try for thunder. 
This sky that I'm under it's the best sky for me. 
I've learned less from daylight than from night threatening to leave. 
All along my voice goes after what my hands cannot reach. 
I ran through the fog without you, through the low hard language of rain, afraid that if I caught what I came for I'd never want it again. 
This life to me it's like a try for thunder. 
This sky that I'm under it says God's been good to me. 
One night in the rain you set me straight. 
You said I have everything I need, and for every slow day in the sun there's two storms in between. Where I am is where you'll find me at the edge of many things, hands outstretched, doing circles in the rain, grinning like a thief. 
This life to me it's like a try for thunder this sky that I'm under it says God's been good to me.",Try for Thunder
Chamberlain,"Winter comes hunting like a wolf on the wind, and the lovers lie unknowing in their beds. 
It won't be long before the cold and the snow kill off the flowering armies that summer's led. 
You dig for your last smoke as the highway leads you home, and this day's going down in a flame. 
And evening is a reminder of the beauty of the end and that the end might be the reason why we came. Night's handing silence to the hillsides where you walk, but you want that deeper silence that stays up in them hills. 
The field is a lover with her colors at your knees but you know there are stranger flowers still. 
And somehow you tell yourself that, like a rain could: 
""I'll be back again."" But as you pull up to your house you know that you can't go in...
Until the day burns down. 
We live the long walk of a question, my friends. 
I think about my sister out in the rain; and all the heroes I know that she'll never find, and that she'll never leave as perfect as she came. 
My mind is a symphony in the dark and my heart is an old museum with all of these memories that I keep. I got to get back to where the sun raised the flowers and the flowers they raise me. 
And somehow you tell yourself that, like a rain cloud: 
""I'll be back again."" 
But as you pull up to your house you know that you can't go in...Until the day burns down. 
If I could hang the stars up, I'd hang 'em up one by one, to leave this world with something my hands made. 
And when that sun came up and made 'em all disappear I'd know my work was real, because nothing real can stay.",Until the Day Burns Down
Chamberlain,"No moonlight over this one lane road tonight, but I don't care at all. 
I could use a bed, there's a hotel up ahead, but I don't know how far. 
In the backseat the smell of vinyl and wet streets must have helped you get to sleep. 
Inside of me I got a thousand old dreams and not one of them came for free. 
I know the world don't want us here, and only the wind can dry these tears. 
This night's a tomb but you're a patient moon waiting to flame tonight. 
This world's a close call, all these deserts and waterfalls, and mountains lean against the sky; shine, shine, shine, shine with me...'cause I know the world don't want us here, and only the wind can dry these tears.",World Don't Want Us
Chamberlain,"Three down, five more to go.
It ain't like they don't know, I want 'em to get their things and go. 
I'm sick of all these people that can't speak to me, unless they've found something to drink. 
Cold cup of coffee is on the windowpane, where it's been since you left yesterday. 
Next thing I knew I was under you, with your worn out shoes next to my boots.

[chorus:]
Maybe we no longer know who we're supposed to be
Feelings aren't cheap around here
Somehow everyone finds 'em for free
Trains loaded with slow as much as coal, haul the mile home
while you two spoke. 
And I dunno who you are anymore, what ya'll want, what you're lookin' for.

[chorus (2x)]",The South Has Spoiled Me
Chamberlain,"There's nothing so strange
As us taking these chances
I miss the way that your eyes
When you're sneaking glances

Halfway to Lexington
We'll fly by poor houses and
Take a midnight stop to parish hotels
Just to ask which way south is

Hey, Louise, it ain't worth all this misery
'Cause I know the world don't want to see
And only the wind can dry these tears
So move on, move on with me
Hey, Louise

I snuck up to your room o
One cold, Sunday morning
Begging you to leave with me
I kept my engine running

There was nothing I wanted more
Than to have you company
And I can still see you standing
At that door watching me leave

And one good thing I got
When I left that time was
That your face was the last thing
I saw as I pulled out

Hey, Louise, it ain't worth all this misery
'Cause I know the world don't want to see
And only the wind can dry these tears
So move on, move on with me
Hey, Louise

Hey, Louise, it ain't worth all this misery
'Cause I know the world don't want to see
And only the wind can dry these tears
So move on, move on with me
Hey, Louise

Chamberlain,"By this time, you'll be sitting on top of the world
In your overcoat, all studded with pearls
You might be drinking good wine
Some real good wine out of crystal cups
You know I'm still here in the shadows
Tearing my heart out over love
I ain't unhappy
I'm the same just a little more soft
You know I'd ask you for a piece of your time
But I wouldn't know how much it'd cost.
It's the last time you'll ever see my face again as long as you breathe
So going out add another voice to life's great song
We all knew you had it in you all along
But I'd climb the tallest mountain for you
So while you're leaving, you take what's yours and I'll take what's mine
And we'll both call it even
But boy, don't let those gravediggers in sight
And don't ever pour too much of your heart out
If you ain't got no place to hide.
It's the last time you'll ever see my face again as long as you breathe
You destroy my mind
I think about it all the time
you've given me a piece of your soul
Just like I've given I piece of mine
But boy, get your wagon to a star
Cause there's a thousand people who would kill to be right where you are
These nights I just stay up and watch the stars climb the hills
And know I wish that I could say I could be as bright as them
But I know that we never will.
It's the last time you'll ever see my face again as long as you breathe
You destroy my mind",The Last Time
Chamberlain,"I carved up those empty avenues, filled them up with the thought of you. 
You're with me like back avenues, lovely and alone. 
There was nothing like the river of summertime. 
We both wrote of paradise, just burning a trail out to nowhere with nothing at all. 
You were the hero we all used to shame. You left us stranded in nowhere. 

We are the lovely and alone.
I hope you could see the good in me. 
I need your company, and that lifelike vision of horses returning home. 

And we all walk down a lonely road, dragging a star back home on our way out to forever, 
The sky turns gold. You were the hero we all used to shame. 
You left us stranded in nowhere.

Snow on a bridge in the cold moonlight ? you asked which way I was headin?; and I told you, and you walked to the other side.

And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
Now ridin' with a new chick; she like, hold up
Next to the Play Station controlla
It's a full clip and my pistola send a jacker into a coma
Girl, you ain't know I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryin' a bone ain't tryin' a have no babies
Ride clean as hell, so I pull in, ladies
Laws on patrol and you know they hate me
Music turned up all the way to the maximum
I got speakers some niggaz tryin' a jack for some
But we packin' somethin' and what we have for um
We'll have a nigga locked up in a maximum, security cell

I got a blunt up in my right hand
Forty ounce in my lap, freezin' my balls
Rollin' up a tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep me and my dogs
Yo', I gotta hit the back streets
Wanted by the six-five, and I got heat
Glock, glock shots to the block we creep, creep
Pop, pop, hope cops don't see me on the low key
With no regard for the law, we dodge 'em like, fuck 'em all
But I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car and a blunt to spark
Wonder if you want nigga it poppin' dog

Yellow band, excuse me Cham, please give me the time again
Diamonds so large, the minute hand ain't got no time for them
Damn! How you supposed to see the time when them
M & M-sized diamonds lay right beside the hand
Chamilll, Rasaq, and Lil Wayne make a nigga feel ashamed
Trying to hide the bling in the middle of your little chain
In the drain, down it go, say they love the sound of those
Chamilltary boys, we the illest boys around here hoe
Flier than a bird yes but your correct if your guess
Is that the eagle gonna hurt when aiming at your bird chest
Pow! Forget your feelings, I could care less
Leave you where I leave you, you can see ya in the turbulence
Girl do yourself a favor and don't say I have to pay ya
Give a favor to a playa and just pass it to my neighbor
And when your finished could you tell your friend to flavor
Cause the king ain't gonna savor, just gonna save that ass for later

Mayne I'm fly as a plane, me and Lil Wayne
Spitting game, leave a girl Weezy like his name
We don't have to say a thing cause the chain can explain
First they look at the piece then they look at the rang
I'm fly as a pelican, ice on my skeleton
On a Sunday morning, I stay sharper than a reverend
Candy on my doors, looking something like gelatin
Syrup in my cup but I ain't talking about medicine
I'm cold as an Eskimo, throwed from my head to toe
The white tee fresh but it starts in my denims though
Yeah and if I pull down my fly, I could piss on the sky
Cause nigga I'm that high
I pulled up in heaven up in the candy painted ride
And I gave Jesus five and I'm still alive
Even though I know them haters wish I would die
Even in they day dreams, I'm a still stay fly boy

[Chorus]

They call me Birdman Junior, I'm flier than the rest
I'm trying to get a couple cool pigeons to the nest
And if you look at how the jewels glisten on my chest
Then you will be impressed and yes that's V-S
Fly boy to death, I used to only fly
First class on every plane 'til I bought a jet
I'm on the runway, let down the steps
Open the phantom door and light up the cess
I smoke the best, Chamillion come get me
From University of Houston after I pass my test
Swisha laced wit' syrup, it'll come your nerves
So boy I'm so high, I could palm the world
Yeah and I'm strapped for the turbulence
Pow! Now you up here with me in a cloud (Chea)
They call me Weezy Baby, the son of a stunner
Bitch I'm flyer than a motherfucker, ya know

Poster child to the pop trunk, I pop it up and let it bang
I'm show ya how to rep the city, correctly run the game
Grip tightly on the grain, turn it left and we call it swang
Let me show ya how to make the baddest ladies scream your name
I'll put that boy ""J"" Junior in the future in a body bag
I'm trying to poke that bad body like a boxing bag
Trying to get below the belt and beat it like a boxing jab
Hit it then I quit it like I dropped out of a boxing class
Know how we doing it, we been chopped and screwing it
Coming to get that number one spot you got like Ludacris
Know he acting groupie-ish taking a sip out Luda's Cris
We buy our own bottles, grab one and put it to your lips
Hating on your hood, throw your hood up, put it in his face

Me to have the courage to walk right up and say it to your face

A hater never admit he hate
By the time they figure it out is probably gon be too late (yeah)
Grinning up your face is like you tryin' to let me know
That you ain't really happy how how I'm getting all this dough
Let the truth be told tell me is your friend a foe
Better make it clear or get mistaken for a hoe (Yeah)
And then you take him to the floor

How could they tell you, you was built to last
You built like a boxing bag, put a whoopin' on that ass
See us approachin' that set in motion in that hour glass
Wrong words are built too fast, find your exit and dash
Lookin for crabs in a bucket tryin' criticize me (me)
But they do it around them niggas don't say it around me (me)
And if they do us opposite how they feel about me (me)
Turn my back and they relax and talk that lip behind me
I see you a busta and I'mma bust ya in your lip
Put some lipstick in my fist, throwin you a kiss
Since I see that you a sucker, suck a gasoline dick
Put it right up to your lip, put a lighter to the tip (boom!)

What type of visual stimulation, she needs to be able to achieve
There's something special bout ya, that ain't hard to see

Asked ya if you was married, and that's when you answered no
I asked if you had a nigga, and that's when you said fa sho
So I didn't care, as you walked away I was stare
At your bottom in apple bottoms, your waist was shaped like a pare
Really round at the bottom, a little thin up there
So instead of letting ya leave, I pursued ya just like the playa
That I am and damn, couldn't help but to help myself
To a helping because I smelled some perfume, that can make me melt
And you shoulda seen my demeanor, I had to control myself
Approaching you from the rear, as I tapped you right on your belt
And you tried to look surprised, like you didn't know I was behind ya

Cause God must of been working hard, when he assembled you
I'm trying to test drive, your rear and your shape
And I'm power steering your waist, and I see your rear is in shake
If you thought I couldn't handle it, then you're really mistaken
No one here to keep you near, then you're here for the taking
I'm still waiting, for you to give me one good reason
Why you couldn't leave and be speeding, off in some good breezing
You'll never spend another boring night, in some hood freezing
But posted up by standing water, during some good season

Had to tell you, that I'm really feeling your style
Saw you walking by, and couldn't let you pass
Gotta tell ya, that I'm really feeling your smile
But even better, is the beauty of your ass

OK a couple niggas but none of em' real as me.
Tell your favorite rapper to diss me if he disagree (gree).
I'm bad I'm actin like your favorite rapper isn't me. 
Tell your second favorite who's the best, and show him a picture of me.
He'd have to take me out to prove that he's as sick as me.
So me verse me the only battle that y'all going to get to see (haha).
I'm playin' sayin' what I'm sayin'to make these haters mad.
Prepitratin' hatin' ass see me ridin' candy slabs.
Disbelieve his ass, how many vehicles can he have?
I be losin' count myself, and I ain't even that bad at math (math).
That's how we do it in Texas, poppin' trun and grippin' wood (wood).
We reply to threats how?
Nigga I wish you would.
If you keep on talkin' (talkin'), but that's if you could.
Gotta trun' my speakers up, can you hear em' now?
No, Good!

[Chorus]
Ain't runnin' from a thang, 
'Cuz I ain't never been a punk, drama in the thang,
'Cuz I can bring it if they want, I'ma let it bang,
So they can feel it in the mmm in the trunk.
Your body wit ya' gang, decide your rep and throw it up, what you tryin' to drank?
'Cuz I'm about to get ya' drunk, 
I keep it pimpin' man,
So they can feel it in the mmm (chamilitaryman) in the trunk.

This for the street niggas knowing they gotta pee in a cup.
Know your P-Officer tossin' ya' when he see the result.
This for the G's (G's), haters what you see in the scope.
Gague gunna get sprayed, likes its sprayed when you see them approach.
Tell you ahead of time, solo i can handle mine.
You ain't to smart but play the part like you a panamime (boy).
But you don't have a nine (nine), I'll show you a hammer mine,
The kind that'll make you do the runnin' man like it's hammer time.
Shout out to the west, and all my gangstas kackied up.
Actin' up, and packin' up, Heat that make you back it up.
The hoes back it up soon as they hear the back of the trunk.
Now my stock like New York slang,
What you mean? That's what's up.
Money, stack it up when they feel they have enough.
Get the chips and add em' up, then she givin' that to us (us).
Don't put all that in cuffs, treat your money like a slut.
Niggas better share, hell yea, 'cuz i just wanna cut.
A hata gettin' cut someone goin get hurt (hurt),
Specially if you met me and was disrespectin' turf (turf).
(If it's Texas)I'm the worse (worse), ice lookin' like sherbet,
Bouncin' off my chest, you starin' at it like a pervert.
Mix tape god (god), don't me go to church first (why?).
Might as well since all the rappers wearin' church shirts.
Better think ahead a time, call yourself a nurse.
Diss me in your second, and wont get to finish your third verse.

[Chorus]
Aint' runnin' from a thang, 
Cuz I aint' never been a punk, drama in the thang,
Cuz I can bring it if they want, I'ma let it bang,
So they can feel it in the mmm in the trunk.
Your body wit ya' gang, decide your rep and throw it up, what you tryin' to drank?
Cuz I'm about to get ya' drunk, 
I keep it pimpin' man,
So they can feel it in the mmm (you in the presence of the finest) trunk.

The game is full of fakers, all these rappin' niggas front (front).
Controversy sells, the industry givin' em' what they want (want).
See he ain't gangsta as he say, that's why they dress em' up.
Get a vest, a plastic gun and go pull a publicity stunt (stunt).
Ho act like she slow, don't know dat I'm rich.
Can't ignore the handle missin' from the doors on my whip.
But then she saw me on TV and told me pause for a flick.
What you tell her? 
You can 106 and park on my dick!(on my dick).
Can't speak about Texas and not mention men (me).
The world goin' to have to see the truth come out eventually (ly).
I wreck any gimmick rapper out from A to Z.
934-829 to the two if you still disagree (gree).
We never marry a ho (no), what im a marry em' fo.
I'm to busy tearin' up my shows and gettin' married to dough (dough).
Grave digga nigga, what you mean?
I burry your flow, run go get ya' city come back, then I'm goin to burry your area code.

[Chorus]
Aint' runnin' from a thang, 
'Cause I ain't never been a punk, drama in the thang,
'Cause I can bring it if they want, I'ma let it bang,
So they can feel it in the mmm in the trunk.

My life is real baby, you peeping me take a picture
You peeping me take a picture, (you should take a photograph) - [2x]

[Bun B]
Catch me today, with a cannon or a Kodak
Cause by tomorrow, yesterday gon be a throwback
(You see it's real, they be like look at that
Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph)

[Chamillionaire]
Introducing the truest voice of the South, it's who else but me fool
Don't let all that foolishness they feed you, on T.V. mislead you
Don't let all the magazines, and them papers out there deceive you
The cups that be used to sip, but Caucasian kinda like my tee do
You see that hand be glistening, you see the Sedans we flipping
The hundreds of grands we getting, these units of scans we shipping
You see that Caddy tipping, them thangs on that Caddy twisting
That paint and that candy dripping, that drank and that can is missing
That ain't a Cola, though dry and you feeling sober
Boys trying to switch it over, apply it up in a soda
Home of the Houston hustlers, who grinding and hit the quota
Who fire and hit the doja, you high when you sniff the odor
Told ya you gotta have, a foreign or buy your slab
Afford it then buy it that's, important without it now
You ain't gotta take college class, to see that we bout our cash
You not if you gotta ask, let's take a pic by the slab hol' up

[Hook]
You see my slab, you see my candy slab
Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph
You see my chick, you see my chick is bad

Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph

Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph

[Chamillionaire]
When I'm tipping they'll probably watch me, the cops'll be paparazzi
And try to patrol my posse, we shining and glowing glossy
The jealous will try to top me, we keep it too real to copy
What I'm listening to ain't a floppy, that disc gon be Screwed and Chop-pied
All the ballers will ride to this, deposit deposit slips
Buy the car and apply the fifth, raise the trunk an entire lift
Use to go to that Kappa, but Kappa ain't been as crunk
So I'm popping up at Daytona, on chrome and I'm popping trunk
Jamming that ""Ridin' Dirty"", while riding beside the laws
And they staring over at me, trying to scare me like I'ma pause
Tell 'em naw they know I'ma crawl, all day in the robber cause
I'm trying to go wash the ride, till them tires have whiter walls
You peeping him take a picture, that chrome and that paint official
You smoking then take a swisha, there's plenty just take 'em wit ya
You chilling you ain't a sipper, then I'ma be hanging wit ya
Take a hold of the grain and grip a, handful and smile for the pictures nigga

[Bun B]
You see the bling up on my bracelet, and the shine on my chest
Syrup in my styrofoam, it's sweet with doja no cess
You done put it down with the rest, time to roll with the best
Cause when you ride with the original, you ain't gotta guess
I'm the connection that you need, when they say it's a drought
Cause it's not really a drought, them other niggaz just out
And I'm the plug you gotta have, when they say the river's dry
Cause it's not really dry, they just ran out of supply
I'm too fly for the clouds, too down for the green grass
Better wear tinted lenses, if you look at my clean ass
Catch me today, with a cannon or a Kodak
Cause by tomorrow, yesterday gon be a throwback
Candy still dripping, 4's is still tipping
Wood grain grass, steering wheel I'm still gripping
Repping for P.A.T., the West and the East
And I'm repping for Pimp C, till he get back on the streets it never cease

[Chamillionaire]
My life is real baby, ain't just a song (ain't just a song)
Gripping that wood wheel baby, and riding chrome (I'm riding chrome)
This is for the real playas, that get that do' (that get that do')
Tell me how it feel baby, to see I'm-I'm riding candy and chrome

Catch me today, with a cannon or a Kodak
Cause by tomorrow, yesterday gon be a throwback - [2x]

Know I'm saying, gripping wood
Riding through the hood, and feeling good
Just like we say down in Texas, it's already

Chamillionaire,"I was sitting back, and I was thinking man
I ain't even trying to deal with this shit no more, you know
Cham' I don't know what to do yo, ya know
Seem like everytime a nigga make one step man
Nigga take two steps back, you feel me

They told me that pain was just in the frame, the irony of that
Cause that was the slogan showing, when they tried to see my tats
Never knew what was in the skin, would finally be a fact
Feeling like mother nature's, right behind me with a gat
Take that, the rain's loud on the window when it taps
To hell with the time, I thought that I could finally be relaxed
Tired of being po', yeah trying to leave the rats
Walk out to see three of your tires, that be on flat
And that one tire, left a sign of hope
That helps you to keep on grinding, when you kinda broke
That helps you to keep composure, up around your folk
That keeps from trying to wrap a rope, around your throat
Don't choke, you feeling like giving up
Life isn't a million bucks, you feeling like living sucks
God's telling you hear your boy, but you don't wanna give him trust
Mama telling you pay your tithes, and you yell at her back, ""for what""
So the pastor can ride faster, to get some rims on his truck
I don't think that they'll miss, ten percent of negative bucks
Put some Henny up in your cup, your problems will start to drown
But soon as your buzz leaves, then problems come back around damn

Keep your head up is what they telling me
, well it betta be
Sorry but the world keeps stressing me
Rain drops cloudin up the memories
It's gonna be alright is what they telling me
Don't let the stress get the best of me
Trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
Till my brain gets cloudy bout a memory

God knows, how I feel now
On the outside I'm smiling, but inside a nigga know he hell bound
It's a dark road, and I'm right here in the middle of it
Do I walk slow or if I run, am I'm missing some'ing
I took the time out, to save a little bread
Now my eyes, got water in em
Why the fuck am I still standing here, nobody love me I ain't happy here
My mama said, she can't handle him
But still, I'm looking at the bright side
But I view it through my other eye, cause it's a different color sky
Then the last one, my mind set on the prize that may never come
So do I try to stay alive, or do I grab a gun
End it all, put a stop to the pain
That goes on in my head, everytime it rains
But that was speaking, so you listening to the thoughts
Of an evil spirit, in demonic verses everytime I talk
I'm confused, by my psychological set backs
In the storm, washin out through the wet cracks
Looking for heaven, off in all the wrong places
I've given up so why the long faces? Let it rain

Your bills keep adding up, to be alone you prefer
Bill collectors steady calling, starting to get on your nerves
Your rent due on the first, but right now it's the third
Telling yourself it's gon get better, but ain't believing a word
Feel like it's hard to deal, tomorrow it's hard as steel
Not to mention the realest member, of your family is getting ill
Tell me it isn't so, tell me it isn't real
In the mist of all the drama, you take a lil' time to kneel
To deal you take a pill, just to deal with the drama
You thinking your life sinking, and there isn't a plumber
They tell you what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger
You'd have to be a Superman, to live as much as me partna
you're trying, but help is just what you dialing
Cause the room is a monsoon, that's never gon get to drying
The storm is moving on, and you thinking these people lying
They saying they had it worse, but how come they all keep on smiling

Don't let stress take control, gonna be alright I know
I'ma make it through fa sho, fa sho yeah - 2x

My memry, heeeey-heeey yeah
Stressing me-stressing me, my memories
That's what they telling me
I'm trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
By my memories, yeah heeey yeeeah

Remember, the sunlight always comes after the rain

should be a celebration of life.",Rain

You can talk that talk, but I'ma walk that walk

I'm a surviiiii-iiii-vor, true survivor
If I walk out that do, and don't come back no mo
Let the liquor po, and let the people know
I was a rider, that's fa sho

We them niggas getting hated by haters, we them niggas that done made it outrageous
Stack the money in the streets nothing honey nothing sweet, I'm sick my chips contagious
Animals none of y'all can't cage us, got me feeling like the Heat and the Lakers
Had to switch up my team but what do ya mean, we already traded them traitors
Spend a lifetime surrounded by fakers, in the night time you high 'cause it's safer 
Spend a lifetime to grind and get paper, while all y'all crying I'm flying to Jamaica
Grinding steadily fine and cheddar he, know how to show ya the nine is deadly
Wanna be a pussy nigga fine then let it be, anybody crying that's around it's never me
Realer than the rest when it come to plex, get it off your chest if you so upset
Is that what it gon' be if it comes to yes, then I guess that day will become a mess
They messed up when they told me the sky's the limit, 
'cause I'm married to my money nigga I'm committed
If it's gold at the end of the rainbow then my gang go, get up in the vehicles and ride to get it
I'm a nigga that made it up from the bottom, I'm a always get into a lil' drama
Y'all don't know what it means to be a rider, gotta deal with anybody that got a problem
I'ma put supreme in the Impala, I'ma put some cream up in the bomber
Jack it that's it nigga go get a dollar, looking for me I'm busy my nigga holla

Got the weight on my shoulder like solo flex, do the drama myself that's solo plex
I don't know what you do fo' yo checks, but my part of the do' way mo' they less
I'm gripping wood I know I'm fresh, 'cause I am that CEO and yes
The mo' I make they more upset, but I'll be damned if a nigga don't show respect
Ask the streets in the South about the kid, and they gon' tell ya I be doing my thang
We could do the beef or we could do the peace, as long as you ain't speaking my name
My partna told me you was jocking homie, and my other boy said the same
The result of that when I approached the cat, I gotta hit him with the pain like bang-bang
Physically and mentally, a rider a nigga that'll tell 'em see
I bomb on your ass it was meant to be, because I told y'all niggas not to mess with me
Do you let the beef slide, and let it die down with all your deciding
In the streets they know Cha-millionaire be riding, Batman my heat riding like Robin
Tell 'em that I got 'em if he's on my team, 'cause loyalty's something that you're gonna need
Loyalty's something others don't believe, like a ghost that most suckers ain't known to seen
But you know that a rider can notice hating, and use it to fuel all the motivation
Success is something that's fa sho to make em, back down they don't then I'm gonna break em",Rider [*]

Cause they denyin' is racial profiling
Houston, TX you can check my tags
Pull me over try to check my slab
Glove compartment gotta get my cash
Cause the crooked cops try to come up fast
And been a baller that I am I talk to them,
Giving a damn bout not feeling my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin with an even madder mood
I'mma laugh at you then I'mma have to cruise
I'm in number two on some more DJ Screw
You can't arrest me plus you can't sue
This a message to the laws tellin' them WE HATE YOU
I can't be touched or tell 'em that they shoulda known
Tippin' down, sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone, tryin' to find a chick I wanna bone

Chamillionaire,"Yeah, a lightning bolt strikes in the air, yeah, finally it's here
'Cause y'all are the judge, the day of judgement finally is near
In your eye I see a tear, and it's remindin' me of fear
Rap's been dead so long, so stop denyin' what you feel
Dis payback for the fact that y'all ain't tryin' to keep it real
Grim reaper that we call Revenge right beside ya in your ear
He's saying your time expired, time is finally due it's clear
Not sober mind is a weak mind and he's buyin' you a beer ha ha ha
Cheers time for a toast (your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin')
To the haters that hate you the most (your heart's beatin)
And the friends that pretend to be your folks (your heart's beatin')
This is what revenge sounds like (your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin')
I hear your heart beatin', keep runnin' your mouth, yeah

Your mouth runnin' ahead of you, your mouth do what your legs should do
Let me walk to the edge with you, jump off of it, it
It sounds like your ready to, cause these rappers are terrible
And the game is unbearable but I'ma fix, fix
This feeling that's dead in you got your brains like a vegetable
Use the Pro Tools and tell 'em to edit it, it
Switch to somethin' that's better fool, turn it up what you better do
When I'm bringing revenge to you it sounds like this, this, this
Somebody call the doctor (you're not breathin', you're not breathin')
They ain't gonna be well after this one right here
You're not breathin' (you're not breathin', you're not breathin')

Anybody gotta problem? (you're not leavin')
Speak now or forever hold your peace (you're not leavin')
I ain't think so yeah!

The feeling's great cause they pay me, I expect some hatred so daily
I'm sticking the middle finger up like the feeling's mutual baby
The franchise and they say that the future can't really trade me
In Houston, I'm number one like I'm in the place of McGrady
But keep on pacing it baby, the full truth has arrived
If they ask you about you nigga, you fin' to lie
They ask me about me and hear a truthful reply
They said they seem none better than me so hear the truth wit'cha eyes

Better go take over befo' it rains

I know these haters is gonna hate
And I see that angry look on your face
Tell 'em Sound of Revenge is on the way this isn't your day
Lookin' for the truth, they ask me where have you been?
(Where have you been? Where have you been?)
Getting ready for these haters, I got somethin' for them
(Somethin' for them, somethin' for them)
You're real quiet 'til you think you hear a sound in the wind

You turn around cause you think you hear that sound once again
You hear that? (Yeah what's that?)

Start the violence, start a riot.
Get this motherfucker crunker, crunk as you can get it.

Skinny ass niggas don't fight with a nigga.
Pull out a billfold, put a price on a nigga.

From the car to his pocket then right in your liver.

Ya head fast think you hold a mike with the killa.
Don't mess with the south homie, thats a dream,
Hallucinate or imagining so.
Double X.L. with the gats I mean,
Keep somethin' ready to blow in the magazine.

Ridin' in the classic.
Totin' me a classic

Get my desert E's and get to motherfuckin' poundin'.
Up and down the streets,
Throwin' heat, out the driver's seat,
Ridin' to the beat,
Tell them nigga just lay weak.

[Chorus: x2]",Southern Takeover
Chamillionaire,"[Chorus]
I want to know who you are but you seem very nice
So will you talk to me?
Should I tell you a story? Should I tell you a treat?
They think I'm crazy, They don't understand how I feel

See, it started off as just a simple conversation I gave her
The name of my record company, (Oh your a sanger)
I said my name's Chamillionaire and I'm a rap entertainer
(Oh you that guy they talking bout when they be whisperin, ain't cha
Bring your name up when they talking and say money will change ya
I heard a lot about how you can't deal with your anger
Heard the rumors how your always in trouble or danger
Not gotta judge you if it's true, there's no need to explain sir
You do have a right to be, you seem like your nice to me
And like your gonna buy me another drink, yeah would you like a seat?)
I tell the boy the same hennessey on ice for me
Her drink starts emptying as she's pouring out her life to me
Telling me about her goals and how successful she would like to be
And invite me to a session of her life and she
Seems so damn innocent but something isn't right to me
She pulls out her picture phone ""I got pictures, would you like to see?""
I'm thinking she gotta be friendly as hell
Giving a soul to me, it's like an identity sell
We never met is the story that my memory tells
Telling me tales like she doesn't handle hennessey well
Getting into it, getting intimate and into details
See, I just met you and you showing me your kids
""Who said I had any kids? I didn't bring up no kids""
Then who's in this picture, ""Man, let you show you just who it is""

[Chorus]

Umm, I don't remember her name but she look like an angel
She wasn't from here, I knew she didn't hang a
Round a part of the hood but hey the story gets stranger
Cause this stranger was stranger than I could explain you see
She said she wasn't married but the rings on her finger
Told me she was langin and using the same uhh
Game I use on women so I couldn't even blame her
Spitting the game I spit to 'em when I'm trying to bang her
(I bump into this dime, he told me that he used to know you
He told me about the loyalty and love he used to show you
He said what he said with a passion like it was so true
Wouldn't take advantage of the fact that the listeners didn't really know you)
There's pictures in my pocketbook, almost got it, I'll show you
She digs in her purse and while she fumbles around
I find that photo, I'm like ""Oh no there's some trouble in town""
I turn around as these two officers is coming in now
They walk in real suspicious and come and sit down
So close, I can see they barrels of the guns to the ground
So close that they can listen to either of us now
We turn back around and she says no need for whispering
Then she tells me that (I don't really give a damn whose listening
Try to make it last a long time was my mission
And he kept on tripping and then I got pissed at him
Hit 'em with my fist and my punches were never missing him)

[Chorus]

Okay, let's get this straight, your man cheated on you and now
You talking to a perfect stranger like it's making you proud
And the rest of this conversation she just telling me how
It wasn't her boyfriend in the pic but a familiar smile
She said (pictures can be deceiving like she knew he was foul
Look closer, you'll see a coward who uses a smile's power
Fleeing the smoke strength, couldn't stand it another hour
So she did what she did then she went to go take a shower)
Damn what do you mean? ( couldn't tell you that I missin him)
I don't understand what your saying, how did you get rid of him?
She dissing him, as I ask her what it is she did to him
She stops, Ay keep talkin I'm listening
(I don't wanna tell about the images I'm picturing)
Henny spilling then she tell me (For real and
I got the feeling of what I'm feeling is that I wanted to kill him)
Something's wrong here and I know just who is the villian
The poison's getting louder, the moral is getting clearer
The officers is looking at us and I can tell they can hear her
Told me (It was protection, Reached for it in the stash)
The plastic is what she grabbed and she put it right on his ass
Bust it before the blast, she thought she was free at least
Baby I think you crazy, Sorry I'm pressing for time
I gotta go grind, time's putting to resting
Now I'm sweating and stressing, this girl's got me guessing
That this conversation is two types of evil confession
And she pulls a clearer picture, It's my damn ex-best friend
How you know him? She told me she was with him at his house
Watching movies on Sundays when they be chilling
And that's exactly the day that the hospital came to get him
The feeling was the worst feeling that she could possibly be feeling
Stood up and then I yelled out ""Why in the hell did you kill him?""
I didn't kill him, I have AIDS, he had sex with 'em and that's crazy",Think I'm Crazy

When I look back at my life, I realize-realize something ain't right
I'm missing you Lord, in my life make it right
I got something to decide, just wanna make-wanna make everything right
Cause there's a huge void, a huge void in my life make it right

I'm staring up at the Pope, it soak it up while he spoke it
Mesmerized and repeated, like he the author that wrote it
The broads are the ones I love, just don't wanna be the corporate
So waiting for death to approach this, take the time to say no sis
I don't hate ya, for having these little seeds
At seventeen, best believe they're a beautiful breeze
Of fresh air when there's nothing else, I usually need
Just a smile look at em now, hoping you just believe
And my broad been in place forever, I'm gone but I'm chasing cheddar
Been gone could of kept it going, with a poem or a basic letter
But naw I just hate to tell her, try hard but I didn't let her
The groupies get at your boy, but you're my Cinderella
Look girl we can make it better, but there's a gift and a curse
While you healing a nigga feelings, yours are usually hurt
It ain't amount of cash on Earth, to match what you really worth
Know your turf has been the church, that's where you put in work
And you put in overtime, because you know the sign
And most danger that I've been lately, rap is mo' than rhymes
But you still hold me down, I'ma do way mo' this time
Got some time that I need to manage, girl you know that's right
And that's speakin' like a true deacon, cause even to see you sleeping
That comfortably ain't enough for me, anything that you needing
I'll cease anything that squeaks, and cease any sink that leaks
Ain't nothing gon interrupt, your sleep deep into them sheets and peep

[Chorus]

How your father call the police, have your mama put in the jail
When the arguments always started, and ended up in a cell
Hard to it was the thought of this, ring that you use to wear
As I darted out the apartment, and pawned it to get the bail
Argument after argument, drama wasn't hitting well
Target it ain't no harm in it, smart so I didn't tell
God that it was the hardest, yeah life was a living hell
Spent part of it steady dodging it, charging off in the trails
Father say he a Muslim, your mama say she a Christian
The Bible or the Koran, which one would you be picking
The cards are in your palm, ain't really no use in tripping
Be true to the one you choose, ain't really no use in switching
Yeah they gon' have to be mad at us, choice is something I had to trust
Standing up when I had enough, for my blessings not adding up
Take too many things for granted, right after that metal bust
Somebody's life is missing, that's when the spirit grabbing us

[Chorus]

A religion is what you missing, someone tell me how can it
Make people panic, mention God and all the weak people vanish
Take God your woman and your family, even your own life for granted
Until you slanted on the planet, with your face in the granite
And I won't have it, I don't wanna see my coaching divided
So I decided to remind it, there's a choice and provide it
So put your ego to the side, soon as you standing beside it
Raise your right hand, and let the spirit know it's invited
Don't need to fight it, I just wanna make it right 'fore they bury me
Cause the truth is like therapy, plus my conscience is tearing me
Into pieces as deadly was dealt, was not even fair to me
To the soldiers that passed in the game, we missing you terribly
Thank my family especially, in my mind like telepathy
Staying humble is the recipe, keep my faith and he blessing me
I use the energy left in me, to make sure they respecting me
Walk the steps of my destiny, like I know he protecting me
I'm a leader, believe the people won't get to see less of me
No they won't see the death of me, or no police arresting me
I live life so successfully, and just show em the best of me
On another level mentally, this position was meant for me

North side, South side, chunk ya deuce up 
This is for my gangstas, real niggas, ballas, trill niggas 
East side, West side, chunk ya deuce up 

Plenty niggas get they head turned red for da bread 
Start off with da information, load it up in ya head 
Couldnt hold it, so it turned out its somethin' he said 
Wut he tell da FEDS (he need someone to call) 
Your decision was to snitchin' and they was there to listen 
When he told what he know, said they barely was trippin' 
Less time, now da niggas in a better position 
Unless you count the fact that the streets know he was snitchin' 
He was lookin' at a 30 but he only did 10, 
How your years turn to months, can he tell you dat, and 
He ain't really gotta answer, just the sweat in his hands 
Will he make it out to make it, mm well it depends 
Everybody know the info you was tellin ya friends 
Plus the streets know the deals that you made with the pen 
Russian Roulette, yep nigga bet the barrel will spin 
You hear that, yea nigga that's the sound of revenge 

Walk down the right road, 'cause the streets is so cold
You betta take ya life slow or you'll miss it 
Listen to da G-Code, if you know what I know, 
Then you'll keep yo mouth closed (keep you're mouth closed nigga) 
We don't tolerate snitches

If you goin' live that crime life, I hope you hold dat 9 tight 
You live life like a pussy then dats prolly what you die like 
I neva' eva' loved a sucka, them ain't really my type 
Rat snakes, yea mayne the game is full of wild-life 
Don't wanna do no time right? 
You wanna live that high life 
Like go withdrawal, have a hundred thousand in ya eye sight 
Enter ya crib, see the clouds peepin through ya skylight 
You be a copycat, (cat), 'cause mine right 
That's what he told me but I didn't listen 
Doin' crime for a dime wasn't my intention 
You insane, think his name sumin' I will mention 
Only snitches need someone to tell 
Alotta niggas in the game, hustlin' doin' they thing 
Usin' codes on the phone with they usual slang 
If you know what he know then you won't say a thing 
You wouldn't need someone to tell 
Careful bout the life you lead, ain't smart with ya life, 
You plead, the streets will ignite ya T, like you ain't got the right to breathe 
To choke on da realness, reality is what the fake don't know how to deal with 
Words leak from the teeth, but he'll say seal it 
Then go get a undercover brother he can chill with 
Find a nigga that be hustlin to make a deal with 
But the streets will hold court for him and'll deal with it 

Walk down the right road, 'cause the streets is so cold
You betta' take ya life slow or you'll miss it 
Listen to da G-Code, if you know what I know, 
Then you'll keep yo mouth closed (keep you're mouth closed nigga) 
We don't tolerate snitches 

[Chorus]

This for the G's, street jugglin', move da fire 
When you talkin what you talkin' it ain't through the wire 
Police pull you over, now they callin' you a liar 
You got amnesia, don't even know the dude beside ya 
You don't know, you ain't sayin', you ain't heard what he said 
Told you a closed mouth ain't gon neva' get fed 
A open mouth'll get you county instead of the F-E-D-S 
Some scared niggas speak up so they'll be less in the red 
Niggas can't deal with no 95 so they day-to-day budgeters 
Its the hustlers that get put away by the customers 
You upstate, niggas use to be southerners 
Here the streets make the laws and don't answer the governors 
We the niggas that's too real to snitch on a snitch 
But make a snitch turn to puff with a flick of the wrist 
That ain't goin' get in arguments, just go get you a clip 
And they goin' think about the consequences, let em repent 

Walk down the right road, 'cause the streets is so cold
You betta take ya life slow or you'll miss it 
Listen to da G-Code, if you know what I know, 
Then you'll keep yo mouth closed (keep you're mouth closed nigga) 
We don't tolerate snitches

Man hold up, you a real nigga and you ain't got nothin' 
To say when they come question you, 
Just keep it 100, and go on a chunk ya deuce up",No Snitchin'

Chamillionaire,"[Chorus: x4]
From the South
I got the diamonds in my mouth

Hold up a minute, I'm the King of the Ghetto
Holding the rap game, like wood grain can't let go
You niggas'll never see me, I'm on another level
Stay ready to dig a grave, keep a gun and a shovel
And pouring gas too, if there evidence
Saw me in the rear view, now you wonder where I went
I'ma get you if I owe ya, visit ya residence
Lay the merk game down, and then I'ma hit the fence
Better keep my mouth closed, so they can't see the shining
They think it was Z-Ro, cause all they seen was diamonds
I'm cold as a deep freeze, with bags of ice in it
My 3-57 pretty, but ain't nothing nice in it
Too many bitches, and not enough rubbers
Got so many, all my real niggas under the gutter
Watch a nigga full of life, light close like shutters
God damn, staying healthy is hard as a mo'fucker

[Chorus: x4]

It ain't no lying or fiction, up in me please
I don't exaturrate the price, it was fifteen G's
When they ask, about the colored diamonds in the piece
Yeah I'm one of the richest, southern niggas in these streets
Yeah I'm candy flipper, you can have a picture
While I pose like a playa, by the candy with ya
Koopa never have no time, for no panty pinchers
My nigga, how come you ain't take me to Miami with ya
It's a couple haters out there, that won't let me be
I feel like yelling F' the radio, like SPC
The movie room in my crib, got a empty sweet
I'm with Sway, I'm getting interviewed by MTV
Yeah I'm ill at rapping, but I'm still not capping
Ain't touched a damn drug, and he still ain't trapping
I don't change don't sleep, cause Chamil' ain't napping
Stop acting like platinum, with Chamil' can't happen
I'm a Northside rider, ain't got to worry
Cause the major deal, is not about to turn me
Yeah the controversy, ain't about to hurt me
I don't play no games, like I forgot my jersey
Still ride around the city, with none of my niggas with me
Still ride for H-Town, if don't none of these niggas feel me
Ain't gotta like me, or have none of these niggas hit me
I'm a be the M-V-P, if don't none of these niggas pick me
A lot of rumors in the streets, ain't none of it really pretty
Getting money, makes all of the drama seem itty-bitty
Pick a click, I don't hang with none of these niggas really
But I'm glad that the majors, is running up in the city cause I'm

[Chorus: x4]

Ever since 1999, I had diamonds in my grill
You just rapping that ain't platinum, homie you need to chill
Cause you embarrassing Texas, nigga you ain't trill
Nigga you been on my dick, way befo' you got your deal
These rappers finally get some fame, and think they got it locked
After your album flop, nigga you gon be on Koch
My gear clean, from my ear rings to my pinky ring
If you ain't spend thirty, boy tuck in your piece and chain (Southside)

[Chorus: x4]

Blucker-blucker-blucker, that's how my gun go
If I'm looking agitated, bitch you better run hoe
I use to do the baguettes, but now I'm VS-1's though
Princess cuts straight up and down, Johnny done those
I got loud ice, just like Paul Wall
Shining down South, brighter than all y'all
When it's time to get your jewelry done, who do y'all call
Cause you fellas ain't shining at all, check me out
On the first and fifteenth, I'm some'ing like a pimp
Even with a suspended license, still finna flip
Ain't no limit to this cash, ain't nothing I can't get
Five deuce Hoover cause, ain't nothing like a Crip
Ride with a Revolve', I don't fuck with clips
These roach ass niggas, trying to make me bust my chips
But I'm not a bank, I don't even trust my bitch
I'm from the South, and I got diamonds in my mouth

They turn to vegetarians, they don't wanna end up mince meat
You'll see, where the mortuary was at, I know you miss me
Snatch the gat, brrr-at! And lyrically wreck that ass officially
I see you live in fairytales, niggas better switch beefs
I had a tooth fairy choke his ass up outa his sleep
Problem with Chamillionaire? Do they mention any names?
Hell no! You scared crow? Try your best to be brave
Got a Smith & Wesson bro, we know that you gon' behave
Safety, your locksmith, like you could get a key made
You all up on the thang like little girls turning teenage
You really a bunch of hoes like 6th street at Texas relays
Ohio to Chicago, I got niggas in them PJ's
Bully, skinny, but the arms strong like you was BJ's
I hear these rapping niggas but believe I'm not a fan of it
I'm here to rid the rap game of all its contaminants
I'm better than the average, I want her, I can have the chick
Doing the same pose as Paris Hilton in them camera flicks (haha)
The mathematics get big cause I'm demanding it
Raping the rap game while these other suckers is romancing it
They worried about its feelings, they don't wanna take a chance with it
Kissing up to the game with rose petals and a candle lit haha

I'm a get it regardless, hard as it is
Who wants to be a millionaire? Know how I'm a get a million
And I'm in the pavilion

But we both count the same as
Long as when I say I'm with it, it come out the same as
If I wanna win with it but I'm out the game

You know the Feds are my biggest fans
I got to watch what the little one's saying, man
They see my momma and they wanna pull her over
Cause she ain't got no number on the back of the Rover
And yep, I'm locing
There's cooler ways to die but I'm smoking
There's cooler ways to ride but I'm soaring

Ay, you never know, when your boy might touring
Just trynna get me some air on Mike Jordan
Of this whole thing right here, I'm staring
Y'all boys just appear, I'm here, the Tardis
So applaud him, yeah
Chinky eyes, keep faring
Look like Keith Moorer, street aura, uh
Still I hustled in the street like he poorer
Run up on him you sleep and eat aura
Decent Christians, he owes momma, those
Gucci seatbelts will look better with the barker

I asked if you had a nigga
and thats when ya said “Fo' sho.” (So)
I didnt care As you walked away I would stare
Atcha bottom, in apple bottoms
Ya waist was shaped like a pear
Really round at the bottom, a little thinna up there
So insteada lettin ya leave I pursued ya 
Just like the playa

Couldnt help but to help myself
To a helpin cause I smelled some perfume that could make me melt
And ya shoulda seen my demeaner i had to control myself
Approachin you from the rear as I tap you right on ya' belt
And ya tried to looked suprised

But I could tell by ya smile ya was waitin on me to find ya
Mess with my thought a bit

You dont wanna look like a freak and pretend its hard to hit

If ya think I couldnt handle it then ya really mistakin 
No one here to keep you near
Then you here for the taken

For you to give me one good reason
Why you couldnt leave him speedin off with some good breezin
Ya neva spend another cold night in some hood freezin
But posted up by sand and water during some good season

Outro:
Had to tell ya that I'm really feelin your style
Saw ya walkin by and couldnt letcha pass
Gotta tell ya that I'm eally feelin your smile
But even better is the beauty of ya ass
Staren right into the beautiy of ya profile
There's something that i gotta ask

How's life, tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier then ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I'd loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

Get off your couch and go get it

I'm up early in the morning thinking bout getting this money
All I know is I gotta get that paper
The hustlers told me that I gotta get it, get it
Now I'm gettin it the best way I know how
I won't let you down, won't let you down 
I won't let you down

I'm up early than a mother, chasing mine cause I'm a hustler
Then tomorrow everything is gonna rewind
Only seven days a week and 24 hours a day
That ain't enough for me so I ain't wasting time
Cause only dreams come to sleepers and my life ain't getting cheaper
So you know them dollar signs, they on my mind
When they ask me where I'm goin? I say you already know
I'm bout to hit the streets and go and get what's mine, I won't let you down
Dreams of having finer things, Ridin blades and dreaming should
Make you wanna wake up and get it in real life than see the wood
In your grip, If you slip and don't grab what you see then good
Only place that you gonna be or ever see gonna be the hood

Boy that word ain't no excuse, You know what it mean to me
It means you passing over opportunities repeatedly
Write it on a piece of paper, Only thing I see is P
That paper, paper, paper chaser, better thing for me to be
Nah, my services ain't for free, make that money multiply
Early in the morning I be gone, chase with me, it ain't gonna be no tie
Try to explain and give em game, I don't know why I even try
You do the same if you was I, but you are you so you gonna lie
Make em think that you got cash, tell them ladies you got slabs
Only thing you get is laughs, You can't even bring down half
Of the bill that's on that tab, Only thing wrong with being broke
Is staying broke and making excuses bout it like there ain't no hope

I don't know how many times I gotta tell ya
In the hood, having no condition, I was having something
I remember it like it was yesterday
They was talking down on me and I lost a couple homies
I was getting mine while they used to play
They say I need to slow down but I ain't slowing down for nothing
I don't wanna let the paper get away
So when I'm in the streets grindin, ain't no need to be crying
The best way that you can help me is to pray I won't let you down
Partners that was getting lazy, Females that was acting crazy
Then promoters that tried to play me, Mixtape labels that didn't pay me
My old homies that ain't around me, Dissing rappers that came to find me
Major labels that didn't sign me, left all that nonsense behind me, I got paid

See, rich people ain't going to tell you how to get paid
And broke people act like they the richest people in the world
Always tellin people with money how to get it
Always spendin money that they thought they was gonna get.
Always buying things they can't afford.
Stop making excuses.
If chronic smoke makes him sleepy, he's gonna tell ya he got chronic fatigue
If liquor makes him drowsy, he gonna say he got that grey goose disease
If women keep taking his money, he gonna tell ya he slipped off his sleeve
Whatever your weakness, stop making excuses please
You should not be in couch or in house, you should be in route
If you gotta ask where, then that's the reason you ain't got nothing
You don't know how to listen, go get it",Won't Let You Down

Bust brains, cause I gotta maintain

Chamillitary mayne
You should worry bout you while you worry bout me
At the top of the charts is where you know that I'll be
I got the streets on lock and I'm insertin my key
I got the game on smash
Come back to the streets (x2)

[Verse 1]
Had to make a couple trips to the islands
Now I'm internationally known
Had to make another switch with
My provider got the international phone
Had to add a little bit to the rider
First class have I asked to be flown
And they keep callin me, tellin me get back in your zone
These boys is cartoon characters, too much imagination
Just a little too much animation from the maker
They know Cham can erase them
Travelled all over the world
And my experience is
Yall experienceless, y'all ain't experienced shit
I grabbed the Grammy, I hold the one
Got plenty strikes, way more than some
Hush your mouth please, hold your tongue
No obstacle could ever slow my run
When it come to rappin I'm the coldest one
Put my hand in the air and I froze the sun
Got the platinum plaque, not the golden one
And I look at y'all like I told ya uhh
Been a boss, win them cars, pull up I bet ya that menopause
Yea menopause like women drawers
Yea I bet i show ya how to kill that noise
Phantom of the opera pass em by your copper
In the new phantom, phantom is a dropper
Cash I got a lot you mad cuz you are not the talk up in the streets
And mad cuz you are not, uh
They say its got to be street
They say its got to be street, don't go commercial Koopa
Its got to be street
Major label ain't the only thing universal about me


Come back to the streets (x2)
And gimmick rappers they focus, most of these jokers is chokers
But I don't even play poker, pull em down your cheesy lookin posters
They look up to me like a bird
I look down on em like the curb
My movement lookin like its movin
Your movement look like a *screeeech*

They callin me
Come back to the streets
(Keep sayin my name)
They callin me, they callin me
(Keep sayin my name)
They callin me

[Verse 2]
Yea, the life I live is just like a movie
Every corporation, they tryna sue me
Phony people be tryna glue me
Till they side they try stick it to me
Lucky for me I got the tooley
Not black and decker but its black I bet ya
Stay in the streets, do that for pleasure
So much paper they ask to measure
When the ruler or stackin moula
Is speakin to ya don't interrupt
Middle finga up on the ceiling
Somebody gon eff you up
Don't let the black tux fool ya cuz I am not the one
I come out the suit like Clark Kent to make sure your done
Rappers ain't real, rappers they fakers and frontas
They caucasian in the winter then turn Jamaican in the summer
Flippin with Pitman and Straw you know they ain't just some gunnaz
Personal trainers that'll brang a couple thangs and make you a runner
Gotta like the producers that made this track
The producers who made ya stacks
Some of you losers need ta face the facts
Put up the duece the ace is back
Take out the rappers you think are whack
Put Chamillitary in place of that
Watch how I erase em and take the plaques
Then I unloosen a case of *gunshot*",Come Back to the Streets
Chamillionaire,"Gas prices raises, the money keeps burning,
Dropout rate rising, so what are they learning?,
Sending the troops in the war so I turn in,
To today's evening news.

Welcome to the evening news, I thank you all for tuning in,
Yes, I'm your host and your journalist,
here Chamillionaire, so let the news begin,
Our helicopters out in the streets
look at the screen, an' let's zoom it in,
'Cause Cashis is live at the scene,
hey Cashis how are you my friend?,
Got no time for no interviews (go-got no time for no interviews),
No time to trip we don't get confused,
'cause this type of news opinion and views
Got no time for no interviews (go-got no time for no interviews),
You know I keep my ear to the streets
so it's up to me to bring you the truth,
I saw a movie where George Bush had a bearded man on his squad,
So much power from oil money that poor folks can't sit by him,
No problem, Osama, Bin Laden, Been hidin'
So long that them pictures all starting to look like him on them milk cartons,
Don Imus made comments that made everybody forget about him,
That's him, Anna Nicole got pregnant and had kids by him,
Rest in peace Virgina Tech, too many innocent kids dyin',
Well let's just blame hip-hop and act like that's the big problem,

Now I would give you news about Katrina,
but you know I can't talk about Katrina,
'Cause everytime I talk about Katrina,
they look at me like it's a misdemeanor,
Anyways, there's way more important stuff that we can discuss,
George Bush is playing golf, everybody hush, he's about to putt.

Gas prices raises, the money keeps burning,
Dropout rate rising, so what are they learning?,
Sending the troops in the war so I turn in,
To today's evening news.
And the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
As the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
As the world keeps on turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
This is your evening news.

I know you take offense to certain words,
I've heard worse, but I wouldn't blame ya',
They say he's a entertainer, don't worry about it, nevermind Kramer,
The Crocodile Hunter got stung,
and the lion turned on the lion tamer,
We keep sending troops to Iraq,
I figured that we must like danger,
Little kids don't learn in school
they go to school to go spray a gun,
If you a parent, then be a parent,
get off the couch and go raise your son,
Kobe just broke another record, today's game he hit 81,
Now they saying he's number 1, but yesterday they all hated him,
OJ was named innocent, he got no sentence, he's still alive,
It's very ironic that the lawyer that defended him had to die,
Well, now my cue card says the price of gas isn't really high,
But I'm not going to read that,
'cause we all know that that's a lie.

Gas prices raises, the money keeps burning,
Dropout rate rising, so what are they learning?,
Sending the troops in the war so I turn in,
To today's evening news.

We still haven't found Pac's killer,
still haven't found Biggie's either,
30 minutes into the case they got tired and took a breather,
Snoop Dogg just got arrested, everyday he get a new subpoena,
Innocent when murder was the case
so the prosecution got a middle finger,
Hip-Hop is sweeping the nation, but the contents seem so degrading,
Most rappers got new albums that white kids are anticipating,
If you don't like it on the radio
or the television then switch the station,
Flavor Flav get a lot of ratings, Bill O'Reilly somewhere is hating,
Kanye just said WHAT? the president ain't got time for that,
The White House is going to stay white even tho' we know Obama's black,
9/11 was a calculation, and some would say it was a timed attack,
He gave a speech on CNN, they bombed us, now we're bombing back,
Where the heck is Osama at?

And I would love to talk about Katrina,
but everytime I talk about Katrina,
they look at me like it's a misdemeanor
Anyways, there's way more important stuff that we can discuss
N'Sync, Makin da band and Milli Vanilli had broken up,

Gas prices raises, the money keeps burning,
Dropout rate rising, so what are they learning?,
Sending the troops in the war so I turn in,
To today's evening news.
And the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
As the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
As the world keeps on turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)

Very thin yea she be messin around wit married men

Cuz 99% of the time she was rite there wit him
Chances of him losin her in this life are very slim
Money duznt grow on trees u ain't checkin every limb
She gon be a rappa o wow she wants to marry him
She gon still survive when he die she'll have to bury him
When u know u wit a dime they'll treat u like your special
Broad at his ??????? cuz yours left you
Bring her to tha church and the pastor says ""god bless you""
Bring her around ya boyz but be careful they gon get you
Cash in a hidden place ironically called it safe
And ur prolly leavin the safe like its safe in the realist place
I hope u gon stay awake cuz they gon enter and break
And the safe is the first thing that them hataz gon try to take

He introduced her to his motha his motha said that she loved her
And after that he discovered his brotha don tryed to cut her
They messin wit one anotha saw her under the covers
And now he gotta show his brotha the meanin to keep it gutta
All I know is I love her I mean he loves her

Authority alarms the pursuit of an unamed individual
Who crashed his car into the front entrance of a gas station
On the northwest side of town
All tho there is not much info known about the suspect
We are told the assailent tryed to get away on foot

Chamillionaire,"[Intro:]
Yeah, On behalf of Chamillitary Entertainment
I'd like to extent my deepest apologies
To anyone who feels they are offended by the following content
Now that we done with all of the nonsense
If you know you ain't a groupie, make some noise

[Chorus]
G-R-O-U-P-I-E
Told me that she ain't a freak x2
G-R-O-U-P-I-E
Told me that she ain't a freak x2
Baby, You was kinda high maintenance to me
Spent my paper but you let my partner sleep with you for free
Baby, I thought you were in love with me
But obviously, your just a groupie (Groupie Love!)

[Verse 1:]
See, I got a clue when Young Dro said his girlfriend got a girlfriend
That girlfriend of his girlfriend had Chamillionaire as her man
Then T-Pain said he was sprung, said he had fell in love with a stripper
I shoulda known that you was the stripper that was on the pole tuggin on his zipper
Kanye said that you was a gold digger, You always wanted to be major paid
I turned on my TV and then I seen you kissin on Flava Flav
We was both fans of UGK, we was both dreaming bout ridin blades
While I was dreaming, you was gettin laid on everybodys bed and I was getting played
Yung Joc knew that we was through, said he knew he didn't stand a chance
You stood still while my song played and his came on and you did his dance
You kept begging me for romance, I kept telling you that's enough
You turned on my boy Juvenile and then proceeded to back that up
Pitbull said 'Culo!' and I ain't even that good at Spanish
But I knew he was talking to you, I was down with you so I couldn't stand it
Don't try to lie, Don't try to cry, Ain't nothing more for us to talk about
Like Unk told ya take 2-Steps towards the door and just walk it out

[Chorus]
G-R-O-U-P-I-E
Told me that she ain't a freak x2

G-R-O-U-P-I-E

Spent my paper but you let my partner sleep with you for free
Baby, I thought you were in love with me
But obviously, your just a groupie (Groupie Love!)


[Verse 2:]
Gave Bun B a little groupie love, you gave Pimp C a little groupie love
And then you bumped into the whole Screwed Up Click and gave every member in the group a hug
Even messed with my boy Slim Thug, he pulled up, you had a heart attack
You tried to mess with Game and 50 but neither one of em called you back
Ask J.R., my car was pushed to the limit on Cool & Dre
Plus Rick Ross was Hustlin' that money outcha like everyday
You knew that I loved you was them three words that I'd never say
Now your business all over the radio and its the penalty that you have to pay
You made the choice to go and be a freak, even had Akon been smacking that
Her plan was to get ran through by a linebacker or a quarterback
R Kelly didn't have to tell me about your bump-n-grind and your foreplay
I found out and I asked you if this was true, you said no way
Birdman said 'Believe Dat!', T.I.P. was like 'Shawty!'
Then Young Jeezy said 'That's Right!' and Lil' Jon said 'Okay!'
Heard you was messin with Ray J, you did a flick is what they say
I ain't even wanna look at the tape until P.Diddy said Press Play

Told me that she ain't a freak x2
G-R-O-U-P-I-E

If adultery was a felony, then Clinton would be a convict
Put you in the same position and lets see what you'd really do
They tell me that I sold out if I execute the no snitchin rule
Sound like it was a good idea, til a murder happen to you
Dumb-stupid, or stupid-dumb, either one you don't have a clue
Voice perfect for CNN but knew Larry King wouldn't hear it through
Bill O'Reily's an idiot, he ain't the only one with an opinion fool

Cigarettes are still causin cancer, and chronic smoke'll still get you high
In the streets or in the store, know a couple dollars wont get you by
Truth is a Paris Hilton jail cover story could never flop
For that sexy mug-shot I could get a million dollars a pop

Get involved and I bet the indite you, goto jail and I bet they don't write you

They judgin' me like your honor, your daughter's here with her mama
They tell me that I'm a charmer, more freakier than Madonna
Famous look right at me and said 'Know why I got my lighter up?'
Cause like the throwback P. Diddy alias I'm a 'Puff'
See how we rippin up tickets that police be writin us
Do like Michael Jackson's complexion Mr. and lighten up

[Chorus]
Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star
I got em screamin' loud as they be screamin' comin' out broads daily
Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star
She's sayin' she's in love with me and she is probably your lady
Like a rockstar (Lady)
Like a rockstar (Lady)
Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star (Baby)
Catch me gettin' into trouble like it's my job (Baby)
When they listen to the cops come then I'ma (Rock On!)
I been havin' paper, I been havin' stacks
The crowd screamin' loud in every city on the map
Got the groupies goin crazy, they don't know how to act
I bring em backstage and tell em baby just relax

Rock 'n' roll fly
Bitch behold I
I am the shit
Hear the commode cry
Hear the guitar scream
That Double R lean
And if it's for me
Then its foreign
I mean my cars, I mean my clothes
I mean my hos, I mean my flows
You dress different round then me I'm a clean your nose
Step into the line of fire hide the penal code
Compared to big foot, you just twinkle toes
I get ya girlfriend wet like wrinkled clothes
Rock star like, money, drugs, freaky hos
World tours, walkthroughs and T.V. shows
My hair's out (Hey!)
No Shirt (Hey!)
I stage dive (Rock Rock!)

I crowd surf (Hey!)
I'm a hot boy
I'm on my hot shit
Reportin' to you live from the mosh pit

[Chorus]

I'm so cool, I'm so smooth, I'm that dude, I'm so fly
Groupies tellin' me like a spy, the ground be tellin' me that I'm fly
The cloud see me and they cry just to get a glimpse of I
Got Mother nature so jealous she knockin' pigeons out the sky
Can't help it, i got em rockin' they pelvic-bones
And losin' clothes
The higher my album sales get
They love me, that's right you nailed it
They treatin' me like I'm Elvis
Naked pictures she mailed
She licked on a stamp and melted
So save your rap for the rookies, 'cause there ain't no rappers here
A show you do in a club is a show we do in the ampitheatre
We packin' stadiums, ladies come in I'll introduce ya
It's too packed to maneuver, crowd look like LaLaPalooza
We outshinin' the losers, know i ride with the Ruger
You know I'ma producer, weapon upside ya medulla
Got no time to seduce a Super Head type of seducer
Groupies tyrin' to snake me, but Koopa denyin' Medusas

[Chorus]


Rock Rock (Rock On!)
Rock Rock (Rock On!)

We gonna keep on rockin' n rollin' till the wheels fall off.
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Chamillitary Mayne!
Young Money!
We the new Red Hot Chili Peppers
We on fire
Sold out arenas
Tearin' up tour busses
You Know how we get down. HaHa
Rock on, hol up, hol up, hol up
Tryna get the Ozzy Osborne paper mayne
I'ma throw a pool party
Me and the playboy bunnies gonna be swimmin' in a pool of a paper like Scrooge McDuck. HaHa.
You're invited. If you can swim.

[Verse 1]

What part of the voyage is this?
Friendship and business don't mix
Wit anyone else its just business
Wit friends I'm personally pissed
Is this a curse or a gift?
Guess i was blessed wit my wish
Don't tell me that u feel my pain
That I sayin' its best if we switch
You take the fortune and fame
And see if its what u expected
Take the money and change
And be careful where u invest it
Just take the test and don't stress it
You get stopped by a detective
Tryna get in ya personal life
The gotta do yo best to protect it
The answer rests in a message
When I go I'll go in a blaze
But it wont be no captain savin'
Cuz where I'm goin ya saved
Tryna rain down on my parade
Till that umbrella get raised
They thinkin' that they can read me
Then they ain't knowin' my page
Tryin' to keep a smile on my face
Even at times when I engage
In business conversations
Wit people I know are snakes
If life is a piece of cake
Part of the icing is venom
Spent a lifetime tryin to bring me down
But I jus ain't gonna let em
Ya betta tell em

I'm back and forth and I'm pacing
Bein more patient than patience
Tryin to wait for the good news to show up
But im unfortunately waitin'
Gotta be group participation
If its intercourse that we making
I was unfortunately done
And she was unfortunately fakin'
Cuz the only sexual spark


Is the spark he got for the dough
They say till death do us part
But that part is where she says no
There are too many emotions
Emotions like pins and needles
Actin' like emotions are evil
Like showin love is illegal
I thought that it was a eagle
But I've seen this vulture before
He thinks this is where i stop
'Cause he sees that I'm walkin slow
But no I think you should know
That soon as I get where I go
You'll remember the fact that
I had a purpose fa'sho

I Hope You Know Where Your Going

[Verse 3 - Devin Da Dude]

This road has many curves
Many bumps and potholes
It can even take you thru a loop if u ain't got yo
Shit togetha unpredictable weather could leave ya
Dehydrated frostbitten washed away or eitha
Ran ova by heavy traffic watch where you roam
Cuz its a challenge jus tryna make it home
But still I walk I keep my pace I keep my stride
Would hitchhike, but there's too much pride
I must find a narrow path
So I can walk and laugh out loud
Cry and sing without bein judged by the crowd
Maybe someday I could just fly away but for now
I'll jus beat my feet and get there someway somehow
And mile after mile after mile I'll smile
Keepin my head up even though rain's pourin down
And the road gets rough and the journey is long
I might get tired but I must move on

[Verse 1:]
Used to treat me like the bad guy from Houston,
And the media was like Darth Vader,
People turnin' like turntables,
Stay crossin' over like crossfaders,
Try to switch up teams, like ball playas,
So our enemies are like our neighbors,
Keep 'em close, yeah very close,
Most of my folks are still on papers,
You can work, or you can have the work,
But we makin' more than all of y'all wages,
Motivation, makes hustlas make ya,
So we successful because y'all made us,
Used to not, give a flyin' eff,
When they greated us with that one finga,
Whole world jumped on the tip,
And we hit the switch and sat on swangaz,
In the hood they say y'all famous,
Grindin' hard, so we can ball later,
They be like damn, that boy made it,
If they say I didn't, that's wrong data,
First the braud, would try to say I'm fraud,
See me pull that waud, and that braud changes,
Callin' me, she wanna be on the team,
And now she's mad because I'm ignorin' pagers,
Boys thinkin' that they can serve me,
Y'all actin' like y'all waiters,
Same ones who used to walk pass me,
We was underground, but now we on majors,
Keep speakin', beggin' for a beat,
And I'll tell the streets to give that boy a favor,
Turn 'em purple blue and red, all flavors
I got a message for all haters

I was bouncin' back like ping-pong,
Ridin' became the new theme song,
Beatin' on my chest like I'm King Kong,
When I broke the record for the ring tones,
You ever seen a platinum plaque,
That look like that,
Then you seen wrong,
Better sit back and relax,
Cause my platinum reign is gonna sing long,
And I don't blame boys for hatin',
Because they wasn't patient,
And they didn't know the plan,
I knew that something had them shakin,
It was gonna bubble like a Coka Cola can,
And I shook it up like a soda can,

Now my potential is unlimited,
Like the minutes on my Motorola plan,
Accountants and lawyers,

Is you a fan or what?
Sound scannin' in Africa,
Sound scannin' in Canada,
We don't play, yeah VMAs,
It can't get any better, can it huh? (can it huh)
And I know it's hard to stay humble,
They really thought I threw a fumble,
I could of caught that through the trees,
While runnin' right into the jungle,
Could of been little Mugsy Bee,
Turn her back into Mutumble,
Would of still been a victory for me,
You win, then they'll say they love you

[Verse 3:]
Let's give a cheers, (give 'em cheers!)
To everyone who thought I'd disappear,
Thought that every word I said,
Was a subliminal shot to disappear,
Now I'm in a different gear,
No beef, no hate, no dissin' here,
You must of been drunk to doubt me,
You obviously didn't miss a beer,
I used to argue about everything,
With folks that just didn't hear,
Realized, I was wastin' words,
Like whisperin' in a missin' ear,
I say it good and real,
They tellin' me it isn't clear,
My two eyes just didn't tear,
'Cause weakness is what I didn't feel, (yeah!)
It's a better result than last time,
But this grind, it's a different year,
I really should be commended,
For what I've accomplished,
Give a cheer

Get a lobster or anything that she demand
If it isn't then it's somethin' you will never eat again

My helicopter lands on the boardwalk
Where the residents ain't understandin' your talk
The cliff ends and the salt water pours off
Think what you think, but you'll never have a bored thought
Water so warm that the fishes isn't cold
And the air is so open that the pigeons get exposed
Didn't i remind you to bring your swimmin' clothes

Thanks for openin' my eyes and helpin' to me to realize that tomorrow ain't promised, gotta live life to the fullest, whats life if you ain't enjoyin' it, know what I'm talkin' bout'?

My purpose really used to be so unclear
Science fiction with the swagger its so unreal
So fly that my nickname should be up here
Lookin' up is the only time when I appear
I'm a spartan, go ahead and through your spear
Slap failure in the face and still show no fear
They say no show but I show like yea (The champs here)
But the whole crowd know my cheer (Victory)
The media they write about you in the mass, spread rumors bout ya' life and write you was detatched
I know one of my three publicists would ruin my chance, so let me let you know I don't like you in advance but I (thank you)
And I extend their thanks to, to everybody sayin' stuff you know ain't true
You need to go and find God like Mase too, and just stay there with him and try to stay you
Gettin' away is important
I could pull a couple strings like a guitar hand
Better yet bring out the whole guitar band
Grab green we could swing somewhere like Tarzan
I swear to yall' the rap game really makin' me sick
The record industry's your home then I came to evict
Put some nonsense out and I bet you this one'll stick
I put real music out and I'm probly' gon' catch a brick
Brick, on top of brick we'll build a house
Tell whoever said that I'm still filled with doubt
Told me I'm in the right hole then sealed it out
Told me I'm on the right track and killed my route (Ouch)

You never miss a good thing till it's gone
Ya the flow is so fluid it's like drinkin' a song (Don't get the track listing wrong)
This ain't even a song
This is a beat that I must release therapy on
Everybody singin' that they wanna see me successful
Came into the game but now I'm feelin' like (Let's go)
Intimate moments never seem to be special
See the jet, you can bet I'm disappearin' like (Presto)

Never would understand what really matters to Cham so matter of fact the title is just a matter of plan (Victory)

Now that everybody's present and it's Victory night
Let me re-paint the pic, they wasn't depictin' me right (Now what you mean?)
Tell the world that I'm more than just a grille
Show ya how to put your hands on more than a wood wheel
If that's all your hearin' then let me just be for real
Take your contract, To hell with a record deal
Keep thinkin' I'ma lose if you want to
Been through 10 times more in life than you've gone through
Thats why, I always have to make the move on fools
Back on my feet like I got 2 gum shoes
Ya, why you think Em probly' goin' all crazy
Why you think Britney Spears goin' bald baby
Interview me you think you know it all lady
I'm outta here (ya) but not before yall pay me (Thank you)

I appreciate it
You know I'ma use the power respect and the million dollar check to do what I wanna do, but right now, I'm finna take a vacation
A real vacation tho (Ha ha)

Yeah,
I had seen potential,
In your mental,
And was tryin' to make a queen,
But I did it for nothin',
I was huffin' and puffin', wastin' steam,
Everytime I speak,
You be twistin' my words, To make 'em mean,
Somethin' I ain't say,
Then you gossipin', try to break my dreams,
So I'm breakin' up with ya,
I tried and did everything to please ya,
I don't even wanna see ya,
The sight of you is givin' me a fever,
Think I need a breather,
Need ya to give me space,
And leave the, past in the past,
And keep walkin' pass,
When they say that we a,
Match made in heaven,
Tell 'em I said that that's a lie,
So disrespectful,
I feel like I've wasted half my life,
That's why I ain't in love,
Try to say I ain't in love,

And I hate almost everything about ya,

Takin' back everything I bought ya,

When I'm tellin' you get outta,
Here, you disappear,
Then the next day you come back home to papa,
And my mood get madder,
When I'm in the streets,
And I think I spot ya,
Thinkin' I forgot ya,
And I'm movin' on 'cause I think I gotta,
See I end up losin',
Everytime that I try to think I got ya,
'Cause you always move,
And I want to,
But I ain't gon' even stop ya,
You be all in my pocekts like feed me,
Makin' this type of livin' ain't easy,
I be givin' my all to you,
All you do is be talkin' greasy,
And I know you probably don't believe me,
Everytime that you say that you'd leave me,
I be gettin' impatient,


And waitin', hopin' that you'd make it speedy,
So I figured, I'd tell ya the truth,
'Cause I knew that it would free me,
Give ya everything that I could,
But you still kept actin' greedy,
You let the world come inside,
You shouldn't had been actin' sleezy,
'Cause now you pregnant,
With rappers that lie on half their cds

Now I can't even lie,
That I was in love with you,
We did everything together,
That lovers do,
The love done died,
I think it's time to move,
In a direction that ain't got nothin' to do with you,
And everytime, I think of us,
I think that it's time that I made some things adjust,
My love ain't as strong for you as I thought it was,
Baby I'm breakin' up with you now,
And it's all because

When I'm no longer around,
Nah, don't even try to start cryin',
After you built me up,
And then tried to break me down,
It's just a matter of time,
Before I had to give you a piece of my mind,
And maybe I could spend the rest of my time,
Havin' peace in mind,
You couldn't even say one thing,
That you know that no one know,
Everytime I see you gossipin' about so and so,
You immitate,
You instigate,
You turn love, into instant hate,
You the reason why I punched my ex-homeboy in the face,
In the streets,
Chasin' the same money I gotta give to my lawyer to win a case,
Tearin' up my rap sheet,
'Cause now I got a rap sheet that can't get erased",We Breakin Up

Welcome to the South
Try to criticize us for how we live
They gon do the same things that we just did
Betta watch your mouth
Try to criticize us for how we spit
Then say you respect the money that we get
Welcome to the south
Watch em criticize everything we did
And expect that us to never even trip
We know them grills and candy paint
So be careful what you say
Cuz we might just throw it right back in your face
Betta watch your mouth

[Verse 1]
[Chamillionaire]

Uh I cross the globe
I hit a hater
Same whispers from state to state
If you didn't say then this ain't for you
Don't worry bout it cuz you can't relate
Before you buy me then you criticize me
While you beside me
Lets get it straight
Cuz you remind me of the kid beside me
Same rapper that you say you hate
Wanna criticize then fine
Say the south got simple rhymes
Everytime I travel I'm in the backyard that act just like mine
Same rhyme just different times
I don't think that it changed a lil
Used to show our grills and they be like ew
Nowadays they all say thats ill
I remember when the major label
Wouldn't even come pay a visit
Used to say they had love for us but
They just blowin them suspect kisses
Now you watchin me see you plottin me
Can't act like we ain't suspicious
Shoot the slugs you shoot at us but when you bust your thang it misses, uh
I ain't leavin much trippin
Cuz im a man where I'm residing
Im decidin where I'm residing
Should never tolerate domestic violence
I know you'd rather me just relax and sit back in silence
But I'm the owner not just the client
Shit the south is where I stay at

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
[Chamillionaire]

Don't knock the swagga, don't knock the swagga
Then turn around and be a swagger jacker
You a man and you should be a man
Don't walk around without an Adam's apple
We was lookin at it from a distance
But we wasn't trippin cuz it had to happen
Styrophone cup and a snapla, you actin like you been a fan of rappers
You was hatin or participatin when you saw sub anuba slidin through
You and everybody else that did it, they applauded them and they applauded you
You actin like somebody made ya say it
Took your hand and then applied the glue
Turn around and give the mic to you
And now you end up lookin like a fool
Can't holla ya, some followers
and thats the reason I'm in the lead
The rest of yall are some benchwarmers and gettin mad cuz I'm in the lead
I'm switchin speeds, don't get fatigued
Yall behind in line, yall chasin me
Yall finna see my energy, so get off my back and let a playa breathe
I won't lie and act like I'm the one supportin everything
Like southern rappers ain't never lame
Like some of these boys don't eff up the game
Most of us do our thang
And the rest of em leave my ears in pain
But thats him and he sure ain't me
So don't look at us like we all the same

Never been a socializer
Flyin high, work grinder, knock ya gal you can't find her
She was sittin on butter
Hundred thousand under her ass
I was workin the wood, circle smokin candy mashin on the gas
I can't be you, I can't do you
I just do me, if you ain't
Been where I been then you can't
Be who I be if you ain't
Seen what I see and you can't see what I see
I put the bricks in the rolla with slabs on that wasn't free
Been a legend in the south since the year '93
Pocket full of stones, menace to society
The heart in the car chrome and folds, not B's
Now everybody pimpin and they all got keys

I wonder if it's still called memory loss,
If you can't remember the last time you lost, aha


[Verse 1:]
Yeah,
The only time I lose, is when it's my memory,
Haters comin' around here, talkin' about ""Remember me?""
Naw amnesia, Cham leader apparently,
You were just a follower, now I'm about to set a speed,
If they can't keep up, with no one ahead of me,
Victory is just, what I said I can achieve,
'Bout to be trouble, you scared? I think you betta leave,
Hope you don't have asthma *ahum*, go head and breathe

If she a freak don't handcuff her, just let her be,

Somebody smoother, then I'm the ruler, I'm like where,
Is he at just let me know I'ma bury him,
Under the rocks in the bottom of my aquarium,
The chances of me losin' this time are very slim,
If he was bright, then I'm turnin' him down to very dim,
If it ain't me in the sequel, then there will be no sequel,

Chamillionaire,"My life
My life, really feelin hard times

Lookin' out my window, holdin' my weapon like Malcolm X and
And it seems I'm over-stressin', feelin' like hatin' is your profession
And I know a couple Texans that got killed for over-reppin'
So I never be oversteppin' boundaries bounded to my weapon
When they ask me how I'm doin, I just tell 'em ""I'm doin' super""
I got a date with Destiny, allow me to introduce ya
Her little sister Fate told me I'm gon' be the future
And legacy's everything to a Martin Luther King Koopa
This recession is so pathetic, got me feelin' like I'm athletic
And success tryna get away from me and I ain't tryna let it
When they told that Pimp was gone, my reply was ""I don't get it""
And I'm still havin trouble believin' it happened the way they said it
Had to cut some partners off, swear to y'all it ain't my fault
I've been grown since I was seven and I was born to be a boss
But I know there's a bunch of haters tryna see me take a loss
So I be sleepin' with one eye open and put cameras in my vault
I've been thinkin' and gettin' deep and they tryna tell I been preachin'
But I know that they can't see how much of the world that I be reachin'
So stop reachin, stop leachin, I'm a fade 'em out like bleach and
In the spots where they can't get out to is the spots I visit frequent
Europe to UK and Germany, travellin' currently
Made so much in millions that I could cash out in eternity
Accustomed to hittin' customs with that duffle full of currency
When God created hustle, looked at the world and he inserted me, Koopa

[Chorus: x4]
I'm just livin' my life, so cold
In the streets so I'm takin' it slow

Uh, yeah
I'll tell you my story, I only speak the truth homie

It a terrible situation, throwed on the curb within the hands of time
But since I'm blistery breathing I guess a nigga livin' fine
I live a life that's filled with dramatistic people cryin'
And since the hood depend on me, they'll never lose a hand of mine (I gotcha)
I'm paralysis when it come to the good times, I'm used to the pain
Feelin' like a bum under the bridge, I'm so used to the rain
Anything I do is from the heart so it reflect my name
Forgive me for my sins father, I feel like I'm goin' insane
Media criticizing me for checking niggas, fuck it, oh well
I just wasn't raised a little pussy disrespected nigga
I'm tryna live on my own by the ways of a gangster
So every time I leave out I pray so I'm prayin' for a gangster
It's bad enough the world we livin in all about money
Since we runnin' out I choose to believe it ain't nothin funny
I've been stabbed in my back so much I deal with it
I'm tryna kick it with my life before heaven come chill with it

[Chorus: x4]

Last year was a hard one but life goes on
Thinkin' bout my nigga Pimp while I write this song
And the list goes on, all my niggas is gone
I'm tired of hearin' bad news, scared to pick up my phone
Got a call, my nigga Eddy died from Acres home
Just seen him at my video shoot, now that shit wrong
Kelvo, Arborea, even my girl Shantz
I just heard word she got stabbed to death today
Dear Lord, I pray that you take away the pain
From their family and their friends, please help us change
Still warm my niggas sleep dog, stessle and stank
My girl Dee Dee, they got me pourin' out my drank
It's fucked up, all my friends is dead or in the pen
Seem like soon as your life begin it's beginning to end
I'm frustrated, but you gotta smile, your time is dated
You never know when showin' your love might be related, ha ha

Hear my flow, I changed it up
Everybody grab your gats

And hold em, load, sock em
Lock em, cock em
And aim it up
Bang it up
Off in the sky
Catch me rollin' off in the ride

26 inches
Leave em defenseless
45 always tucked in the side
Open your eyes
See me cruisin'

'Cause I keep winning
And these boys keep losing
Plus I'm, the pimp of the year
Playas is hatin' and hos is choosing

Look at all the hos you losing
Then look at all the game I got
And you can catch me creepin' on the low low
Luda ridin' solo, beatin' the block

In the streets I'm peepin' game
I can't trust you, no no
All up in my bigness mayne
I stay on the low low

Say they really really fake
Can't mess with you no mo'
Closest people to you hate
So I be rollin' solo

I'm creepin' on the low low
Creepin' on the low low
Creepin' on the low low
I be rollin', I be rollin' solo
I'm creepin' on the low

Creepin' on the low low
Creepin' on the low low

I want to show all of my haters love (hey!)
This song's for you (this song's for you)
If you had it like me and I was in your shoes
I'd probably hate on me too
See when you're gettin' big cash stacks, all the haters hate that
Cause they hate to see you be successful
I want to show all of my haters love

Yeah, today gonna be ""A Good Day"" I'm feelin' like I'm Ice Cube
I'm wakin' up like can't nobody mess up my mood
Knowin' I'm a boss, I'm a do what I choose
If I was you then I would probably (hate of me too)
If it's true (true), that money is time, then watch this
Ain't tryin' to run out of time, so I purchase some watches
Y'all sick, the chips got the haters nauseous
They chicks jumpin' in my whip like a mosh pit
I wish (wish) I could be effected by any hate but I can't (can't)
'Cause I just get effected by the bank
It's great (great) to never know the feel of bein' fake
I awake, then I go take a visit to the sink
Uh, dirty money got me sanitizin' my hands
Lord knows what the previous owner did with these grands
Yeah, I ain't sayin' it just to brag
I say it so you can be motivated to get the cash

Hold up (hold up)
Success is a woman, I always had dreams of sexin'
If wantin' her is a crime, just take me in for possession
Even in a recession, I'm leavin' a good impression
Reflection on the rims, so they can see they expressions
I'm busy man, you need to schedule an appointment
Haters on they job and they act like they enjoy it
Wake up in the morning, now hop into my foreign
Walk into the bank and it's just like a house warming
Hey, we get the money by the minute
They said we couldn't do it (do it) but we already did it (did it)
I'm fresh outfitted and my Benz got kitted
Cause I get get did it and you did did didn't
I admit it, I'm really 'bout to show you how I do
If you know that you a hater, this dedicated to you
You hatin my last move, I'm way on my next move
See they 'hate to see you be successful

Classy chicks that wanna have a kiss
When I was walking in the mailbox etcetera
With the stacking chips that share packet jets
Had a bucket list to get a platinum wrist
Have platinum shift and get a platinum disc

You isn't there you ain't even done half of this
And now they tellin me they really want the old school back
But where was you at when the old school act
Got exposed to crack for the local rats who were laughing
When they saw the tires go to flat
Tell my enemies that I was born to win
I bet you never go against the boy again

But your lawyer gotta get paid to save you

There's no limit you would think purchase me
What works for them just don't work for me
So don't purchase one just go purchase three

They need a doctor so they gonna surf for me
I put on the gloves and insert the needle
Hope I'm executing this perfectly

I'd lose myself in anything that could take away the pain. Years spent running and I never knew the cost. But shattered mirrors and broken hearts finally showed me what I'd lose. Yea it's like the time is slipping through the cracks. But now, now I wish that I could take it back. We've all been lost before we've all been knocked to the ground. Let go of our regrets and find the strength to turn it around. I know it might seem far too late but we're just about to break these chains that have always held us back.

The actions of a few as displayed on the news,
Turns what we do, into falsities far from truth.
Today we'll break through the walls in our way.
Today we'll prove these lies are false and we're here to stay,
We've worked so damn hard for what we have today.

We can't let down our guard.
We'll prove we take pride in or name,
Today we'll break through the walls set in our way,
Today we'll prove these lies are false and we're here to stay.

This negative media attention is going to bury us alive.
Youth denied expression from what the public misunderstands.
We won't turn our back, we will stand strong.

Champion,"It's going to break and I can see it in your eyes, 
All the choices made
You won't be looking back this time
Tell me what's left to say when it falls apart
Just look at where we're coming from
And how it's going to end

Where do we turn, when there's nothing left but regret and
We seem miles apart?

We tried to make it last, do you remember that? Will you be looking back in time?
Tell me, what can we say to try and bridge the gap?
Just look at where we're coming from
Does it really have to end?

Where do we turn, when there's nothing left but regret and
We seem miles apart?

Can't we change the past, and even after all the efforts made
We still seem to go our separate ways 
But how did it ever come to this
And can we try to make a change?

We need to give this all our effort
Let's try to never let each other slip away, 
Because this is all we have
Different Directions

Let's keep it clear What I need from you is just a little space
Don't understand the goals I've set
Or the choices that I've made
Days fly by in the blink of an eye 
And I find that years have past
Can't spend my life chasing expectations you've set

Let's keep it clear what I need from you is just a little space
Don't understand the goals I've set
Or the choices that I've made
Years fly by in the blink of an eye 

And I'll find that I've grown old
So much to do and so little time 
And I can't live these days for you
That's not the way I want to live

So I'm always going to push it away, 
You need to give me room to breathe
I want to live, live the life that I know is right for me
I want to live, and I know my mistakes

Are just lessons learned
I want to live, live the life that I know is right for me, drug free
I want to live, can't you see what's right?
If it's not my choice, then it's not my life

And I want to live, live my own life",The Break
Champion,"Looking back, wish I could say we left the past behind
But you, you pushed me away
Dropping matches on the bridges that didn't need to burn
And I wish it didn't end this way 
Left with regret and the pain of words unsaid

I never saw it coming and I never saw the truth
I know I played a role in how things fell apart
But years have past and I can see it clearly
No matter what I said, nothing could have kept it from this end

How could you call yourself a friend
When the words coming from your mouth
Never meant a thing?
How could you call yourself a friend
When everything we were didn't mean a thing to you?

And when you broke down what we built
It made me second guess myself, 
It made me second guess all of us
But time keeps moving on, and we keep moving on
Always looking forward, we'll leave the past behind

And I keep asking, what is left?
What's left to say when the ties that bind have torn apart?

Looking back I realize no matter what we said
Nothing could've changed the past
Was it all for nothing? I guess we'll never know
But all that's left are bridges burnt and lessons learnt.",Looking Back

Can you take a breath, push it aside
And pick yourself back up?

You know that the choice to live your life 
Lies in the palm of your hand

You've got the answers you need, just look inside yourself

So much at stake, can't waste our time chasing standards
We never set
We know that the choice to live our lives
Lies in the palms of our hands 

And with the struggles faced just to make it through the day
Stepped out of line and found a better way
So much at stake and we can't let our lives pass us by
And the only ones we'll ever chase
Are the standards that we set

Now's the time to leave all our mistakes behind

With a bottle of whiskey and a glass in his hand
He said come on in sister and brothers and gather too

Chance the Rapper,"Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before, I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young; just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back like ""that's not your jersey?""
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all this money hoping I don't get rich
Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams

Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful, too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop, helping him do good in school
Damn that acid it burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
High schools, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still thinks I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

Oh I am holy, I have been baptized
I have been born again, I am the White Light

Pull up inside a huggy, starsky & hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack in an hour I'll ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling ""fuck me"", two weeks she'll be yelling fuck me
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And chuck e. cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me

Norma jean wouldn't kick it with farmer phil, but these kids these days, they get so
High, burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel shit, shit-faced
Faced it, 15 hits on this l elevated, train, and the craziest
Thing, got me feeling like Lauryn hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap bill bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it, probably shoulda been dead or in jail

Sometimes I'mma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the higgs boson
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did voltron
Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the obi-wan kenobi of the dope see
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm offa codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
Ima end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need em but the chronic all up in my clothes

Mama still wash my clothes, still with Save Money militia
Ima still watch my bros

Why you think they don't talk about it? They deserted us here
Where the fuck is Matt Lauer at? Somebody get Katie Couric in here
Probably scared of all the refugees, look like we had a fucking hurricane here
They be shooting whether it's dark or not, I mean the days is pretty dark a lot
Down here it's easier to find a gun than it is to find a fucking parking spot

I hope that it storm in the morning, I hope that it's pouring out
I hate crowded beaches, I hate the sound of fireworks
And I ponder what's worse between knowing it's over and dying first
Cause everybody dies in the summer
Wanna say ya goodbyes, tell them while it's spring

Said you the man of the house now, look out for your family
He has ordered my steps, gave me a sword with a crest
And gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath

I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
Don't be mad
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up
(Good God)
The blessings come down
Good God
When the praises go up (good God) the blessings come down
When the praises go up

The blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down

They booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor
With the big wide windows, with the suicide doors
Ain't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in Heaven
I know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visit in Heaven
I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions
Like my ex girl getting pregnant and her becoming my everything
I'm at war with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs
I never forced you to forfeit it, I'm a force to be reconciled
They want four minute songs
You need a four hour praise dance performed every morn
I'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn
Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, uh!

I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him till I'm gone
(Good God)
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him till I'm gone
When the praises go up, the blessings come down

Chance the Rapper,"I speak of promise land
Soil as soft as momma's hands
Running water, standing still
Endless fields of daffodils and chamomile
Rice under black beans
Walked into Apple with cracked screens
And told prophetic stories of freedom
Found warmth in a black queen for when I get cold
Like Nat King, I'm doing the dad thing
I speak of wondrous unfamiliar lessons from childhood
Make you remember how to smile good
I'm pre-currency post-language, anti-label
Pro-famous, I'm Broadway Joe Namath
Kanye's best prodigy
He ain't signed me but he proud of me
I got some ideas that you gotta see
Make a vid with shawty and they ship it like the odyssey
They never seen a rapper practice modesty
I never practice, I only perform
I don't even warn, I don't eat it warm, I won't be reborn
I speak to God in public, I speak to God in public
He keep my rhymes in couplets
He think the new shit jam, I think we mutual fans
I used to dance to Michael, I used to dance in high school
I used to pass out music, I still pass out music
The people's champ must be everything the people can't be
I'm getting artsy-farsy, house full of some Hebru Brantleys
You must’ve missed the come up, I must be all I can be
Call me Mister Mufasa, I had to master stampedes

I made it through, made it through, made it through
And everything I gave to you, I gave to you, I gave to you
You got it, you got it, you got it, it's coming (It's coming, coming, coming)

Chance the Rapper,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

Hosena Santa invoked and woke up slaves from south Hampton to Chatham Manor
My dream girl's behind me, feel like I'm James Early
The type of worship make Jesus come back a day early
With the faith of a pumpkin-seed-sized mustard seed
Here, for I will speak noble things as they trusted me
Only righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery
I couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody
Exalt, Exalt, glorify
Descend upon the earth with swords and fortify the borders where your shoulders lies
I used to hide from God
Ducked down in the slums like ""shhh""

I was lost in the jungle like Simba after the death of Mufasa
No hog, no meerkat, hakuna matata by day
But I spent my night time fighting tears back
I prayed and prayed and left messages but never got no hear back
Or so it seemed
A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream
I build the ark, gently, gently, rowed my boat down Noah's stream
Sometimes the path I took to reach my petty goals was so extreme
I was so far down in the mud couldn't even let my light shine
But she was always there when I needed to phone a friend or use a life line
From a lofty height to wage war
On the poltergeist with the exalt of Christ
Spark the dark with the pulse of light
Strike a corpse with a pulse of life
I spit on the Tidal of tidal waves
I spit on the Apple and kill a worm
A fire in Cali will swallow a valley for every African village burned
Jay Elect would've never made it
O' son of man, O' son of man
Who was the angel in Revelations with the foot on water and the foot on land
Who was the angel that rode a Harley from the project to the house of Parliament
And opened the book in the Devil's chamber and put the true name of the Lord in it
Old Jerusalem, New Jerusalem
Cuff lights these beats with a ball of fire
They poisoned the scripture and gave us the pictures of false messiahs
It was all a lie
Mystery babylon, tumbling down
Satan's establishment crumbling down
This is the year that I come for the crown
Bury my enemies under the ground",How Great

Mas rápido que una lancha
Atravesando el canal de la mancha
A puro nado porque tiene la espalda muy ancha

Chancho en Piedra,"Desde que comencé a vivir 
Me di cuenta que no era igual a los demás
Que no vine aquí a morir 
Si no a hacer algo original 
Y no entiendo por qué alguna gente 
Siente temor de ser diferente 
Y que alguien me explique por favor 
Quienes están locos en el mundo de hoy

Estarán ellos bien 
O yo estoy loco
Está todo al revés 
O soy yo

El tiempo que me queda aquí 
De seguro lo haré rendir 
Quiero mi huella en este mundo dejar 
Llenar de obras e ideas acá 
Y no entiendo por qué hay unos que 
Siguen a ciegas lo que otros piensan 
Y que alguien me explique por favor 
Si todo está al revés o al revés estoy yo

Estarán ellos bien 
O yo estoy loco
Está todo al revés 
O soy yo

Las pilas se agotan 
Lo antiguo se bota 
Las modas pasan 
El tiempo avanza 
Todo caga 
La vida se acaba 
Pero lo que hacemos queda para siempre

Y no sé por qué somos menos 
Los que nos preocupamos de ser verdaderos 
De no seguir al líder 
Y ser un pastor en vez de un cordero

Estarán ellos bien 
O yo estoy loco
Está todo al revés 
O soy yo

Las pilas

Estarán ellos bien 
O yo estoy loco
Está todo al revés

This is the window, this is the door
I wanna take eleven in your home

Escuse me my friend, I'm not a gentlemen
I'm sudaca ordaca and I like the maracas

I don't know what I'm singing
But I don't care

Anyway don't understand nothing
And I don´t care

I wanna try to sing like a gringo
Kissing, licking and sucking beautiful girls
I really wanna eat me a tu hermana
I wanna be part of your first world

En un sueño como una revelación 
Tengo que partir muy lejos de aquí 
A encontrar lo que hace tiempo se nos perdió

Pronto volveré, me alimentaré de lo vivido 
Todo va a estar bien, si es que tu querer está conmigo

Voy en tránsito por otra región 
Encontrando nuevas caras de decepción 
Inconformidad con la vida actual 
Todos lo sienten pero nadie hace nada

La modernidad nos está poniendo indiferentes 
Debemos hallar una solución urgentemente por eso

Canta esta canción sin ningún temor 
Que se escuche en todos lados tu invitación 
Abre el corazón a un mundo mejor 
Vamos todos a luchar para que los sueños se hagan realidad

En este lugar, importa lo que dices 
Vale lo que haces, están los que te gusta hacer felices 
No hay fronteras, ni esquemas 
Estás en la nación, de tu imaginación 
No es un cambio permanente de ver la verdad 
Sino paralelamente hacer tu propia realidad 
Creando teorías, acerca de la vida 
Creyendo en lo que hacemos, confiando en algo nuevo 
Debes escoger muy bien a quién le entregas todo 
Puedes estar rodeado de gente e igual sentirte solo 
Sé sincero, pero guarda tus secretos 
Vive como quieras, no como te ordenan 
No hay limitación en la creación 
Así que presta atención 
No hay que ver para creer 
Sino creer para poder ver

Cada esquina del planeta en extinción 
Sobrepoblación, globalización

De contarles esta narración 
Sobre el nieto de una estrella exitosa 
Esa perra de la tele famosa 
Recibamos con un gran aplauso 
La historia del perrito Lassio 
Él es un perrito muy querendón 
Y a su vez también es un poco collie's son (hijo de collie)

Él es un perrito muy guapetón 
Las perritas se derriten por verlo en acción 
Él presumía y se creía el mejor 
Y fue castigado por ser fanfarrón 
Un día conoció a una perra modelo 
Para su suerte ella andaba en celo 
Pero por mucho que estaba excitado 
No logró quedar bien parado

Pobre campeón, Lassio perdió su honor 
Su reputación por el suelo se quedó 
A concretar no alcanzó 
Por culpa de su maldición

Él hizo de todo para solucionar 
Los crueles síntomas de su enfermedad 
Trató con calmantes, pastillas adelgazantes 
Nuevos tratamientos y con medicamentos 
Probó con magia buena 
Trato con magia negra 
Masaje japonés 
Y con pulsera del poder 
Visitó especialistas 
Fue a un espiritista 
Hizo una manda 
Peregrinó a tierra santa 
Ni la ciencia, ni la fe, ni la homeopatía 
Lo ayudaron con su anomalía 
No le quedó otra que la resignación 
De aceptar su lassia condición

Hasta que un día una perrita lo vió 
Se acercó y sus partes nobles olió 
Mágicamente Lassio se fortaleció 
Sanseacabó su cruel maldición 
El no cabía en tanta alegria 
Ella no entendía, pero gracia le hacía 
Al fin y al cabo lassio se cruzó 
Y por fin con ella se pegó

Ya levantó su honor 
Su reputación radicalmente cambió 
Al acabar descubrió 
Que todo mal tiene solución 
El perro Lassio aprendió de paso 
Que lo dulce se aprecia con lo amargo 
Al acabar descubrió 
Que todo mal tiene solución",Lassio

Una entera, la otra a la mitad
Bajo tu cama las tres pondrás
Y a las doce, sin ver una sacarás
Mientras más cáscara tenga
Mayor fortuna obtendrás
Para ser un guitarrista de primera
Bajo una higuiera la noche deberás pasar
A las cero horas el árbol florecerá
Treparás entonces y de la flor te apropiarás
Así la gloria eterna
Podrás alcanzar

Pero si sientes duda alguna
Desconfías, te arrepientes
O miras hacia atrás
Al mismísimo diablo verás
Y el te cegará, ni flor, ni felicidad, ni nada

Are moving apart

To follow your dreams
While I follow mine
I guess it's time for us to say goodbye

A tear comes to my eye
I always thought I'd be with you
Until the day I die
If together we were meant to be
You know that time will show
But now we'll set each other free
We need some time to grow

Oh, we gotta move on
And leave the past behind
And although it hurts me so 
To let you go
We're running out of time
We only live once
So let's take this chance
To find out destiny
And maybe then we'll see

There's two million niggas getting away with crime
There's two million more whack niggas tryin' to rhyme
Now there's four million niggas tryin to eat at one time
It keeps the thugs gunnin' in the blood runnin'
And the judge frontin'
Enough to make nigga touch something

[Chorus]
Niggas fuckin with that strick-nine
The models get mine
So we gonna be big time
Its ghetto business
Niggas jack cars and rap stars
Rockin' the cash bars
Bitches dancin' naked on their lap
Its ghetto business
Niggas hold guns
Hot ones steakin' the biscut
Ghetto nigga soft cores is ghetto business
Yo, drinks and weed son
Never seeds son
I got what you need son
Its all ghetto business

Yo this is for the senile
Walking on the green mile
My lyrics be like the spirit of a teen gone wild
 
Shit is after ten bitch where's your child
With a nine in his pocket lockin' it down like penile
I did the knowledge to born
Your style straight corn
I woke up in the morning
Heard your shit and just yawned
You fuckin' up my high
No lie
You can die
??????????????
Before I break you up like god
Yo its the herb slinger
New style bringer
Rap is for my war plan
Fat like Corporal Clinger
We still bring the hardcore with r&b singers
While the beast ask you out like hoes on Jerry Springer

Yo rally hot boys feel so sick
And I won't stop 'til I'm so so rich
While why'all niggas spit
I (Whooo) blow hits
Don't waste time
And I don't waste rhymes
Few minutes, shit
Track done like swiss
If you ain't hot come like this
Real niggas hold a gun like this
Pop something, one in your leg
Make your ass run like this
Now picture that
Defeat rhymes never that
Son son you brave
You ain't a man cause you got a little something to shade
I've been a thug since the sixth grade
Rockin' a fade

Young Boomy
Look what the ghetto done to me
Made you bolder now
Heart colder now
Brick soldier now
Gun holder now
Nigga snatch my chain, catch him hold him down
Hit him with the hot slugs like over now
I know you want to test rock, what you waitin' for
I live one-thirty-eight basement door
City up north you can't escape the raw
Find me where channel live be at

You ain't fin to blow up shit
You're merely a bomb threat
How the fuck you gonna move a crowd
You ain't moved out from your moms yet
I'm a vet, better yet a vet-er-an
The words Smith and Wessun
Like Megatron
Understand I'm past hip-hop

So dope you better sniff me
And learn to keep me out ya mouth

Fuck around and get hit in the head

Chantal Chamberland,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin
Chantal Chamberland,"Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
The spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while",Once in a While
Chantal Chamberland,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream  to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill like I had never known
You smiled, when you smiled at me that was how the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
I found my love at last",At Last
Chantal Chamberland,"Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

Chantal Chamberland,"If you go away on this summer day
Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in a summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
When the day was young and the night was lo-ong
And the moon stood still for the night birds song
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away

But if you stay I'll make you a day
Like no day has been or will be again
We'll sail on the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go-o I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away

If you go away as I know you must
There'll be nothin' left in the world to trust
Just an empty room full of empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face 
Can I tell you now as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly till your next hello
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away

But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes that I-I love so much
But if you go, I won't cry
For the good's gone from goodbye
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away",Ne Me Quitte Pas [*]
Chantal Chamberland,"When you just give love
And never get love
You'd better let love depart
I know it's so, and yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do?
I'm so in love with you

I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues most every night
Since I fell for you
Since I fell for you",Since I Fell for You
Chantal Chamberland,"In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

Down the street before,
But the pavement always
Stayed beneath my feet before.
All at once am i
Several stories high,
Knowing I?m on the street where you live.

Are there lilac trees
In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

People stop and stare
They don?t bother me,
For there?s no where else on earth
That I would rather be.

Let the time go by,
I won?t care if i
Can be here on the street where you live.

Chantal Kreviazuk,"I could almost remember your face
When I heard your voice today
I could see your lips moving
At the other end of the receiver

It was almost a very good bye
But dial tones tend to make me cry
I call back within moments
You laugh and don't even ask why

That's what we do
Can we do it until we die

You don't see me but I feel so exposed
Each time there is a pause on the phone
I wish there was another button to press
So I could read your mind
In heaven we won't have to call
I'll be with you spring, summer and fall
But for now soon you'll be here
And heal in my arms as the night goes by

That's what we do
Can we do it until we die

So for now soon you'll be here
And heal in my arms as the night goes by

Chantal Kreviazuk,"Its hard to let you go 
You've always let me in 
And helped with all the endings 
And you know where to begin 

I need you here for me 
Cause you always know my heart 
I can't believe we'd change 
Or have to be apart

But if you've seen the love that's in her eyes 
Then everything is good 
And if you know the way she felt inside 
She's flying where she should 
I never believed we'd ever live to see 
An angel being born and flyin' home 

Its good to know your laugh 
And you'll always hold my hand 
And watch from up in heaven 
And always understand 

We'll take you down the road 
And in everything we do 
We'll know how much you love us

Trying to find real love 
You hair was like a fire 
Such a pretty woman 

You were hiding out in the open

For a kiss that lasts forever

And then use you? 
When you get scared again? They could never forget you 
But they could say they said your name

Gets what it is you do 
Knows about the business 

Somebody who can see through 
Someone unaffected 
Someone unashamed

Or disguise
This is me
It's paradise

Oh my serenity
Oh my liberty
Oh I paid my price

Oh my sincerity
Oh my humanity
Oh it feels so nice

I feel so plain Jane
I have no costume
I have no hairdo
A limited attitude
But I can blend in
With the best of 'em
Bring me a crowd and
Watch me get lost within",Plain Jane

Why do we give ourselves away,

Chanté Moore,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Free/Sail On

Chanté Moore,"This mellow jam, is for the one, who knows me from the inside,
he always comes around, when I wear a frown,
and lifts me up from the down side.
Savin' the best for later on, is his specialty,
just wanna take time out to say, thank you for lovin' me.

For every sweet little word you say, thank you baby, thank you baby,
this uncontrollable smile on my face, thank you baby, thank you baby,
thank you for givin' good love to me, constantly, constantly,
just wanna take time out to say, thank you for lovin' me.

Can't figure out how he keeps on givin' me good love,
(after good love, after good love),
(after good love, after good lovin') like it ain't nothin', no.
He can look right in my eyes and see, if I'm truly happy,
I say with all sincerity, thank you for lovin' me.

When everything in my world, seems like it's all going wrong,
and I'm feeling so heavy, heavy.
And my way I cannot see, it seems like no one, no one, no one loves me,
I know that you love me for all that you say, and in every little thing you do,
thank (thank you baby) you !

I can't explain why you give your love,
all I know it's all I've ever dreamed of,
and the more you give, the more it seems I begin to live.
And when the morning comes,
I see the sun rushing through our window,
all I can do is say thank you, thank you for lovin' me.

For every sweet little word you say, thank you baby, thank you baby,
this uncontrollable smile on my face, thank you baby, thank you baby,
thank you for givin' good love to me, constantly, constantly,

How can I be at ease when I know soon I'll lay my eyes on you,
I close my eyes imagining the moment that my dreams are gonna come true.
The way you wear your hair, the shyness underneath your smile,
the warmth of your embrace is gonna thrill me in just a little while.
I rushed right in before but right now I'm gonna take my time,
every moment we share I'm gonna savor like a vintage wine.

And when you kiss me (I'm gonna taste my lips) I won't let go,
and when you hold my hand, baby I won't say no 'cause...

I ain't never gonna love this way again,
no time to pretend, no, no, this time,
I'm so glad I've got another chance, mmm, to love you again,
Oh this time.

I can feel you closer to me, closer as the moment comes,
I thank God for another chance to love that very special one. (Thank you.)
Will he return my love I've held on for so many years,
I close my eyes to cry, then I heard you whisper in my ear...

And he's sure good to me

And don't you let nobody go and steal your pride

I once was where you are
Thought men were all the same
But I never gave up hope
And now my life has changed
Listen to me girls

One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl
He always treats me right, we never fight
He sends me flowers and wines and dines me
Took me home to meet his momma
How he loves me

One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl
Give it one more try
Before ya give up on love

Before I met you 
My life was so different 
It was like my emotions were asleep 
Well, you've awakened them 
And now I'm in love with you 
And everytime I see you 
My heart skips a beat 

Once I was so alone, my heart had no fire 
Baby I was working but I was so uninspired 
Wasn't looking for love, wasn't looking for romance 
But somehow love, it found me 
And then my heart began to dance, dance, dance 
 
Baby ooh baby ooh (come closer) 
Baby you baby you make my heart beat 
Baby ooh baby ooh (come closer) 
Baby you baby you make my heart beat 

The closer I get to you, my lips are smilin' 
The beat goes twice the tempo 
Temperature's risin' 
Now I'm thinkin' 'bout love, thinkin' 'bout your body 
Whenever you're around me 
You make my heart begin to dance, dance, dance 

Baby ooh baby ooh (come closer) 
Baby you baby you make my heart beat 
Baby ooh baby ooh (come closer) 
Baby you baby you make my heart beat  

Funny how love can change even the simplest things 
Baby when you touch me 
Baby when you kiss me 
Oh, there's something 'bout your lovin' boy 
That makes my, makes my heart want to dance, dance, dance

Yeah you've got the power baby 
I love what you're doing to me baby

So no one ever really knows how I really feel
Am I really happy?

Sometimes who can I tell what I'm going through
When I'm feeling sorry

I cry to myself, when no one else is listening
I cry to myself, cause no one else is crying for me

I'll tell you I'm fine but deep inside I'm dying
when I'm all alone no one sees when the lights go down
I cry every night, suffer in silence
no I cant deny, this pain is real but I keep trying

I cry to myself, when no one else is listening
I cry to myself, cause no one else is crying for me

Your the only one can count on on and on 
I can always count on
On and on 
In my life 
",In My Life
Chanté Moore,"[Chorus]
I need your love living inside of me
Living abundantly
Can't live without your love,
No, so keep giving me love

Woman and man
Giving what I say that I am
Receiving all you need
Say that you can
Share unselfishly
Your fidelity
Give me what I need, baby

[Chorus]

Woman and child
Bouncing baby girl
Can I see your smile
Your so beautiful
Your part of all that I am
Love from two made one
I'm doing all that I can
I'm giving you all that I need

[Chorus]

Woman and God
I owe you my life
And I love you so much
You gave your life for me
Forever more
No money, no one
Nothing will ever come before
Thank you for everything

Don't you know, God is.....",Love and the Woman
Chanté Moore,"Don't look back, there's only things 
You cannot change the past 
You're wasting time asking 
What if you linger on too long 
Pick the roses from the thorns 
Wash with waters of the storm 
See the sun in your bad day 
Smell the flowers in your valley 

This moment is mine 
I'm living inside 
I grow with each breath that I take 
I cherish my freedom 
I'm sharing this joy 
I'm glowing like sunshine 
I'm spreading my wings and I fly 
I'm still as the night 
This moment is mine 
This moment is mine 

Possibilities travel endless through infinite 
Our finite minds cannot see the unknown 
To be in your worry what can change 
Not a thing 
In the spirit of your mind be renewed 
It's not too late, redeem the time, seize yourself 

This moment is mine 
I'm living inside 
I grow with each breath that I take 
I cherish my freedom 
I'm sharing this joy 
I'm glowing like sunshine 
I'm spreading my wings and I fly 
I'm still as the night 
This moment is mine 
This moment is mine 

Sweetest moment passing you by 
Live in the now and let's go 
I can't tell you how it feels (it's) so good 

This moment is mine 
I'm living inside 
I grow with each breath that I take 
I cherish my freedom 
I'm sharing this joy 
I'm glowing like sunshine 
I'm spreading my wings and I fly 
I'm still as the night 
This moment is mine 
This moment is mine",This Moment Is Mine
Chanté Moore,"I'm just gonna speak from my heart
This song ain't about every man
But sometimes when you have had your heart broken
And there's pain
You gotta let it out exactly how you feeling it
I realize right now I'm just bitter

I remember the times we shared and I
Remember the long phone calls at night
You used to say the sweetest things
But today my phone rings and I wish
That you would just stop talking
I just can't take this anymore
You broke my heart and I know for sure
You're the man I thought you was
Compromised myself enough
Now it's times to stop living this lie now

Don't follow me home nigga
Stop ringing my phone nigga
Just leave me alone nigga
I wish you well but
Right now I'm just bitter

Why did you come into my life
You didn't plan to do me right
If you didn't mean forever more
Why'd you get with me for?
No free milk that's not yours anymore, no, no

Don't follow me home nigga
Stop ringing my phone nigga
Just leave me alone nigga
I wish you well but
Right now I'm just bitter

Don't follow me home nigga
Stop ringing my phone nigga
Just leave me alone nigga
I wish you well but
Right now I'm just bitter

You make me sick nigga
I ain't your dog nigga
You made me write this song nigga
I wish you well but
I'm gonna find another nigga
",Bitter
Chanté Moore,"I wish I was closer to you
Than you feel
Our love can't be what it should be 
Not until
We face our fears internally from the past
And forgive ourselves for moving way too fast

If we continue not to let it go
Pretty soon we're at a dead end road
With hearts made of bitter stone
Unable to give or receive love, right

Just want to grow gray and old
And live and die in happiness as one soul
So come on, let's move on
Out of this storm

Everything we want
We can have baby
If we both want it bad enough, I know
Everything we want
We can have baby
But we must build our faith and trust, our love

We need to share the things we think, honestly
Without sacrificing peace and made uneasy
We must revive the trust between us once again
And share just as much when we were friends

Even after all that we've been through
I don't want nobody else but you
Better days are overdue for us two
Baby I just want to

Just want to grow gray and old
And live and die in happiness as one soul
So come on, let's move on
Through the storm, hey

Everything we want
We can have baby
If we both want it bad enough, I know
Everything we want
We can have baby
But we must build our faith and trust, our love

Why are we living in unhappiness
And constantly stressed
(Constantly stressed)
Forgetting how blessed we are to be together
We can do much better
I'm ready for a change
And I'm hoping you feel the same
So, oh baby
Everything we want
But we gotta believe, gotta believe
That we can have it
Believe that everything

Everything we want
We can have baby
If we both want it bad enough, I know
Everything we want
We can have baby
But we must build our faith and trust, our love",Everything We Want
Chanté Moore,"Yo, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let's talk about it

I used to have a man
That didn't know what he had
Till he saw me in the hands of somebody else
I mean everyday flat no romance
Now he's sitting at home all by himself
Saying...

What did I do
It's not what you did
It's what you didn't do, didn't do
What can I say?
Not a word that'll get me back to you, back to you
Where did I go wrong?
Well remember the times when you didn't come home
I got tired of it, I'm sick of all this
When a woman's fed up 
Ain't nothing you can do about it

Go ahead with all of that
Cause when you had me
You didn't want me
You just treated me bad
Go ahead with all of that
So what you saw me with somebody else, What?
You're supposed to be mad
You better go ahead with all of that
Baby, baby tough, turn around and walk right out the door
Cause I gave you too many chances 
To fix our romance
But I don't want you no more

No more, no more, no
No more, no 
I don't want you 
No more, no, no more
No more, no more

You used to keep me in the house
Never took me out
Like I heard he was doing with this girl named Kim
I used to tell them
But he really never hit 'em till I quit 'em
I did the same thing to him
Now he wanna say

What did I do
It's not what you did
It's what you didn't do, didn't do
What can I say?
Not a word that'll get me back to you, back to you
Where did I go wrong?
Well remember the times when you didn't come home
I got tired of it, I'm sick of all this
When a woman's fed up 
Ain't nothing you can do about it

Go ahead with all of that
Cause when you had me
You didn't want me
You just treated me bad
Go ahead with all of that
So what you saw me with somebody else, What?
You're supposed to be mad
You better go ahead with all of that
Baby, baby tough, turn around and walk right out the door
Cause I gave you too many chances 
To fix our romance
But I don't want you no more

Go ahead with all of that
Cause when you had me
You didn't want me
You just treated me bad
Go ahead with all of that
So what you saw me with somebody else, What?
You're supposed to be mad
You better go ahead with all of that
Baby, baby tough, turn around and walk right out the door
Cause I gave you too many chances 
To fix our romance
But I don't want you no more

This ain't something we can work out
Ain't nothing for you now to talk about 
And to get as far from each other as we can
Cause you don't know how to treat no lady
And you wanna act all crazy
Say the wrong words, do the wrong things
And expect me to take you back, no

Go ahead with all of that
Cause when you had me
You didn't want me
You just treated me bad
Go ahead with all of that
So what you saw me with somebody else, What?
You're supposed to be mad
You better go ahead with all of that
Baby, baby tough, turn around and walk right out the door
Cause I gave you too many chances 
To fix our romance
But I don't want you no more

Chanté Moore,"In the game of love
It's bitter and its sweet
And you wonder how something so beautiful
Can bring such agony
Let me tell you how it happened, to me

Just reminiscing on the way I used to dream
Prince Charming slay the dragon 
And come and rescue me
So many things have changed
But heartbreak feels the same
Well my strength is what I found
In the eye of a hurricane

And if somebody said
It would never happen to me
After I realized, I still could be happy
So if the one I love
Never gave me love in return
Love's still alright with me
Still alright with me

Be still my heart
No one said there'll be days like this
Well I made it this far
I see where the end is gon' be
I said Chante, honey, gotta keep pressing on
My peace I found in the eye of a hurricane

And if somebody said
It would never happen to me
After I realized, I still could be happy
So if the one I love
Never gave me love in return
Love's still alright with me
Still alright with me

We're supposed to love unselfishly
But somehow I find 
I'm crying myself to sleep, sometimes
Tell me whose at fault at taking care of me
It's me, myself and my heart and I
Somehow we find a way to try to love again
Yet when you lose you tried
But still you're playing a game, well
Just when you learn the rules
You learn the rules have changed
I'm never worried cause I know just who I am
When you live, you learn to be the same 
Even without the name

And if somebody said
It would never happen to me
After I realized, I still could be happy
So if the one I love
Never gave me love in return
Love's still alright with me
Still alright with me

And if somebody said
It would never happen to me
After I realized, I still could be happy
So if the one I love
Never gave me love in return
Love's still alright with me
Still alright with me

Love is still alright, alright, alright with me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, alright
Love's still alright with me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

If the sun don't shine
There's still a little light in my heart
And if the rain falls done
I can still look at love
So if the one I love
Never gives me love in return
Love's still alright

Love is alright
Love is alright
Love is alright
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh love is alright

If the sun don't shine
There's still a little light in my heart
And if the rain falls done
I can still look at love
So if the one I love
Never gives me love in return
Love's still alright",Love's Still Alright
Chanté Moore,"When I first saw you 
I had nothing to compare to
How could I recognize the man of a life time
But when you first told me 
Of the secrets deep within me
I had to admit
This is it
If it not had been fortold
The love that would unfold
can't wait til it overflows
Just look no one even knows
I can't deny it 
I'm ready to try
When I look in your eyes 
I feel butterflies

Your pullin' my trigger duck
I'm bout to blow
I think you know 
Your fulfilling my fantasies
I had before you and me
You knew without know
And my mind is blowing
Come take a trip
Come take a dip

Before they slipped 
Safe in your arms
Deep in your arms

Chanté Moore,"Sit back relax your mind
Just let my love flow through you
Cause all this time my love is with you
And you never have to worry
Cause I want to spend my life with you
You changed my world
My dreams have come true

There's something about you baby can't explain
And it's driving my crazy now I'm goin' insane
Something about the way you hold me babe
I love you
There's something inside you that keeps calling me
And it's taking me places that I've never seen
I'm not afraid to learn from memories
I love you

I never contemplated
That's why it feels so right
A heaven sent love
A match made for two
Don't take your love for granted
Cause love won't wait for you, no baby
Hold on to love
Your heart is telling you
Crying at night when you're not by my side
Thinking 'bout you
Let's take a chance
Take my life and romance
Let my love flow through you
Promise live and fulfill all your dreams
Don't let it slip away, no, no, no
Cause my love's here for you
Baby come face the truth
Don't run away just hold on to my love

There's something about you baby can't explain
And it's driving my crazy now I'm goin' insane

Chanté Moore,"Where do I go when I need security,
Can I depend on you, like you depend on me,
Do my feelings only matter, 
When we're kissing in the dark,
Do you give it a thought, 
That you're tearing this woman apart

Got a lot to do, this life's too short, 
And it takes too long, baby 
This don't seem right,
Are you my refuge, are you my home,
If you can't shelter me, 
Then I'll be moving on

Oh baby you succeeded,
But you're still telling me lies, 
And makin' me cry,

You never take time out for me,
And who do I lean on, 
When this world fights against me,
And where do I run to hide, 
Who fights on my side,
You know I need you, who do I turn to

How many times, 
Do I put my feelings on the line,
For you to say, from where you stand 
Everything's okay,
Since you've been with me, 
You said you've been so true,
But when I'm not around, 
I know you've been with somebody new

She's having a good time, 
Tryin' to steal your heart,
But you can't have two, 
Either you're hers, or you're mine,
I played the fool, for much too long,
As much as it hurts me, 
Consider me gone

You wanted me to trust you, 
Baby, you succeeded,
But you're still telling me lies 
And makin' me cry,
I don't need it

Who do I turn to, 
You never take time out for me,
And who do I lean, 
An when this world fights against me,
And where do I run to hide, 
Who fights on my side,
Oh, you know I need you, 
Who do I turn to, oh no,
You never take time out for me,

When this world fights against me,
And where do I run to hide, 
Who fights on my side,
You know I need you,

Chanté Moore,"Hey baby
I was just calling to say that I love you
'Cause some times I just don't know what to do with you

I take it personally
When he don't answer my calls
I hear your attitude
I appears like I really hate him

But
He ain't perfect
But he's so perfect for me
I know that this relationship
We've got to be so crazy

I say things
He say things
But we don't really mean it
And then I feel like to leave my baby
My man

[Chorus:]
Sometimes I want to leave
But I, but if said I didn't love you
I'd be lying
He's so smart and just a little hurt
Should be a cinch to be feeling this good

He gets on my last nerve
And he acts so nonchalant
And sometimes I wonder why I even bother
Next thing I know we're all over each other

I like to get it
I like to get it
He like to get it
He like to get it

I  your mad, he, your mad
But then we get over it
So you can't even real tell me
Nothing about it

Did you miss your train?
Where you caught in the rain?
No, don't bother to explain

Can I fix you a quick martini?
As a matter of fact
I'll have one with you
For to tell you the truth
I've had quite a day too

Guess who I saw today, my dear
I went in town to shop around for something new
And thought I'd stop and have a bite when I was through

I looked around for someplace near, and it occurred to me
Where I had parked the car, there is a most attractive
French cafe and bar, it really wasn't very far

The waiter showed me to a dark, secluded corner
And when my eyes became accustomed to the gloom
I saw two people at the bar who were so in love
That even I could spot it clear across the room

Guess who I saw today, my dear
I've never been so shocked before
I headed blindly through the door
They didn't see me passing through

Guess who I saw today?
Guess who I saw today?
Guess who I saw today?
I saw you",Guess Who I Saw Today
Chanté Moore,"When I think of love
What I first think of
Is how the different we take
All the love we think we make
Loving in which I sing
Is so much more than a feeling
It has to be shared to be given
Love action gives satisfaction

[Chorus:]
Love taunts, love leads
Love covers, love moves
Love sees, love gives
Love soothes, love magnifies
The good and takes us through the bad
Love is all that

You and me it feels all these
Empty spaces left from good intentions
Bad choices, even crying
Trying hardly to dispel the misconceptions
And reveal what love really is

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Love is all that

(Repeat 2X)
This song
Speaks of love
That's more than emotional interaction
With your so called lover
If your love is real
Do what you feel
Show what you feel
'Cause if you're loving 'em back
Love will last, love will last

Love, love
I'll show you
I'll love you
Love is more than words
You've got to show me
You've got to love me
Show me love, show me love, show me
Love wants to...it covers so I cover
I magnify the good
I love you with all of my heart
I cover you, cover you with all my love

Love is all that, love is all that

Where deep in purple hue, the highland hills we view.
And the Moon coming out in the gloamin'.

[Chorus]

The wee birdies sing and the wildflowers spring.
And in sunshine the waters lie sleeping.
But the broken heart it kens nae second spring again.
And the world knows not how we are grieving.

Chantz,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",The Birth of the Blues
Chantz,"""Gentlemen, gentlemen please! Senors, por favor!""

I once met a man with a sense of adventure.
He was dressed to thrill wherever he went.
He said, ""Let's make love on a mountaintop,
under the stars on a big hard rock.""

I said, ""In these shoes? What is this, the Peace Corps?""
I said, ""Honey, let's do it here.""

So we're sittin' at a bar in Guadalajara,
in walks a guy with a faraway look in his eyes.
He says, ""I've got a powerful horse outside.
Climb on the back, I'll take you for a ride.
I know a little place we can get before the break of day.""

I said, ""In these shoes? No way, Jose!""
I said, ""Honey, let's stay right here.""

Then I met an Englishman.
""Oh,"" he said, ""Are you American?
Won't you walk up and down on my spine?
It makes me feel strangely alive.""

I said, ""In these shoes? Oh, I doubt you'd survive.""
I said, ""Honey let's do it hehehehe""

""Let's stay right here.""

Chantz,"The odds were a hundred to one against me
The world thought the heights were too high to climb
But people from missouri never incensed me
Oh, I wasn't a bit concerned
For from hist'ry I had learned
How many, many times the worm had turned

When he said the world was round
They all laughed when edison recorded sound
They all laughed at wilbur and his brother
When they said that man could fly

They told marconi
Wireless was a phony
It's the same old cry
They laughed at me wanting you
Said I was reaching for the moon
But oh, you came through
Now they'll have to change their tune

They all said we never could be happy
They laughed at us and how!
But ho, ho, ho!
Who's got the last laugh now?

They all laughed at rockefeller center
Now they're fighting to get in
They all laughed at whitney and his cotton gin
They all laughed at fulton and his steamboat
Hershey and his chocolate bar

Ford and his lizzie
Kept the laughers busy
That's how people are
They laughed at me wanting you
Said it would be, ""hello, goodbye.""

Charice,"Opened my mouth
It all washed out spoken
Though I never meant you to know it
I oh
Stolen myself and got held in the moment
Without even knowing

I stop and got lost in my mind
I never felt so unraveled in my whole life

Said I love you, I love you, I love you
But now I regret it
Said I love you, I love you, I love you
But I'm sorry that I said it
But what's done is done
I can't undo what's done
Don't want to hurt this thing we've just begun
I know I've said it, but can we forget this

I
Got myself and I'm scared that we're broken
Though you never got to see it coming
And I
Don't know what my or how our hearts are hoping
My failures are showing

I stop and got lost in your eyes
I never thought you could make me show a lie

Said I love you, I love you, I love you
But now I regret it
Said I love you, I love you, I love you
But I'm sorry I said it
But what's done is done
I can't undo what's done
Don't want to hurt this thing we've just begun
I know I've said it, but can we forget this

Now I'm hoping
Your heart's open
Words unfolding
Now you know it
I, couldn't hold it on inside
Because you beg me to tell you why
Now my secret's spoken

Said I love you, I love you, I love you
But now I regret it
Said I love you, I love you, I love you
But I'm sorry I said it
But what's done is done
I can't undo what's done
Don't want to hurt this thing we've just begun

Charice,"I may not know
Where I'm going now
This broken road
Is trying to tear me down
But deep inside I found
A sacred place
That I never knew
Where I feel safe when the road is untrue
Here's what I learned to do

Just sing this song
And it takes me right back
Where I belong
And every day there's a new bridge to cross
But I'm never far from home
If I bring my heart, my soul, my own
In this song

No,
I don't depend on friends
Cause they come and go
My belief in myself
Is gonna carry me through
That's why I'm learning to sing

Oh,
I'm learning now
I'm ready to sing

Just sing this song
And it takes me right back
Where I belong
And every day there's a new bridge to cross
But I'm never far from home
If I put my heart, my soul, my own

I may not have
All the words
That I need to say and
Though I won't always be strong
But I'm never afraid
Cause I hold my destiny, it depends on me
Alone, alone

So, just sing this song
And it takes me right back
Where I belong
And every day there's a new bridge to cross
But I'm never far from home
If I give it my heart, my soul, my own
I keep giving my heart, my soul, my own

I'm in the shadows
Everyday you know
The pain inside grows

Without you I lose the way
Fall apart, goin' sane
Used to be hiding inside the TV
Lately that's not really workin' for me

No one with anything to say
Not to me, not to me
On and on and on
The days drone
I need a song

What to do
Tell me what I gotta do
I cant sustain
Now the way I'm missing you
So I turn the radio up
Looking for a melody
But nobody's singing tome

Its a blur don't remember what I heard
You say goodbye now I don't know where to turn
So I turn the radio up
Thinking I'm gon' find relief
But baby nobody's singing for me

Every night I'm just a victim of the silent
Nothing there to help
I tell you love is violent
Hurts more and more with each day
If you are asking me
Life is pain

Use to be that I could call on my DJ
Tell him what it is that he could play play play
Play those words, I wanna sing along
Make me feel, nothing is wrong

What to do
Tell me what I gotta do
I can't sustain

What I need right now is a beam of light
A single ray of sun
A voice in the dark
Cause its been so long
I can't feel it whoa ho
I need somewhere to belong
I need a song

What to do
Tell me what I gotta do
I cant sustain ?

I thought I'd weaken when you asked me to meet up again
I was so sure that,
In one second all my emotions would rush back in
You cut so deep,
I couldn't see myself moving on without you

I never thought I'd break free
I always thought you'd be part of me  and nothing can change that
I didn't dare to believe that I'd recover you leaving me
And you couldn't change that

Over, I thought I would cry I spin over,
But I'm more than alright
I never thought seeing you again would make me feel
Nothin' nothin' nothin'
It feels so good to feel nothin' nothin' nothin'

Did you imagine, I'd be on fire
To feel you touch me and say my name
To hear you say it, you wanna start over I admit,
Thought I'd feel the same
I hate to break it to you now I moved on without you

I never thought I'd break free I always thought
You'd be part of me and nothing can change that
I didn't dare to believe
That I'd recover you leaving me and you couldn't change that

Over, I thought would cry I spin over, but I'm more than alright
I never thought seeing you again would make me feel
Nothin' nothin' nothin' it feels so good to feel nothin' nothin' nothin'

How can nothin' feel so good
How can nothin' feel so right
How can somethin' be so completely gone
That was my whole life

I feel nothin' at all

Charice,"Shawty's love is like a pyramid,
We stand together until the very end,
There'll never be another love for sure,
Iyaz and Charice let we go.

Stones, heavy like the love you've shown
Solid as the ground we've known
And I just wanna carry on
We took it from the bottom up
And even in a desert storm
Steady as a rock we hold
Wishing every moment froze
Now I just wanna let you know
Earthquakes can't shake us
Cyclones can't break us
Hurricanes can't take away our love

Pyramid, we built this on a solid rock
It feels just like it's heaven's touch
Together at the top, like a pyramid
And even when the wind is blowing
We'll never fall just keep on going
Forever we will stay, like a pyramid

Cold, never ever when you're close
We will never let it fold
A story that was never told
Something like a mystery
And every step you took we've grown
Look how fast our time has flown
A journey to a place unknown
We're going down in history
Earthquakes can't shake us
Cyclones can't break us
Hurricanes can't take away our love

Pyramid, we built this on a solid rock
It feels just like it's heaven's touch
Together at the top, like a pyramid
And even when the wind is blowing
We'll never fall just keep on going
Forever we will stay, like a pyramid

Like a pyramid girl I'ma show you
That I love you so much that we're gonna get through
Even when it storms I will never go
I'ma be the one to keep you safe
Before was a love I care more than enough
Holding on to one another be the cover when it's rough
Mother nature, or disaster won't stop our happy ever after

Pyramid, keep it going
Pyramid, we built this on a solid rock
It feels just like it's heaven's touch
Together at the top, like a pyramid
And even when the wind is blowing
We'll never fall just keep on going
Forever we will stay, like a pyramid

Soft as stars in April skies are,

Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,

Aren't I lucky, so many things I hear
Sounds that fly in the air there, some are unaware
Aren't I lucky, I have a heart to feel the pain

Aren't I lucky, you stand right up to it again
When I was young I rarely gave a thought
To what kind hurt this world can deal out

Aren't I lucky to have the world at my feet
Aren't I lucky to be able to hear the breeze
Aren't I lucky, I'm getting by so easily
Aren't I lucky, oh, lucky

Wish you were lucky, your world tears my soul apart
Wish you were lucky, want to sing to your wounded heart
Give anything for just one day
Where nothing on earth could stand in your way

Aren't I lucky to have the world at my feet
Aren't I lucky to be able to hear the breeze
Aren't I lucky, I'm getting by so easily
Aren't I lucky to be able to hear the swaying trees
The tide that leaves, my breath this song, oh please

I'm on my knees
I want so much for you to know the sounds, all around
That I hear

My grace sufficient for you, My power's made perfect
My power's made perfect

I've seen the hurting side of love
Lived on this ship with a lonely song
Praying I would drift on

Wandering blind on the four winds
I see Your light shining brightly for me
Please guide me through the mist
I'm lost unless

I lose myself in You, I lose myself in You
Your love is true, I lose myself in You
I have sailed the ocean blue, I lose myself

I think of Your touch, Your smile, Your, Your eyes
And I can't believe I ever thought
That I could be happy and free at sea
Without Your love, I'm not, I'm lost until

I lose myself in You, I lose myself in You
Your love is true, I lose myself in You
And the waves are breaking through
I lose myself in You, yeah

Summer nights have come a-calling
And I ran after always falling
Hard for what was worthless and untrue

You were watching from the beaches
Grasping for my sightless reaches
Hoping I would fall in love with You

The waiting is over
My patient perfect friend
I will hold You in my heart
Until the starry end

I lose myself in You, I lose myself in You
You know I do, I lose myself in You

Yeah, you are the one
Once I was a child
A child in a shroud
Where clouds of dark did hide

The smile you have found
Your eyes have seen my fire
My self serving crown and in my vain desire
You've wrapped your arms around me

You, you, are the one

Once I was afraid
Of all I built failing
But then I called your name
And you became my king

You, you, are the one

You are the one who has lifted me up
When all of the world, buried me
You are the one, who has given me hope
The strength that you give
It carries me, carries me, carries me home

You, you, are the one

Sweet love, don't you ever go away.

Charles Aznavour,"Je ne peux détacher
Mes yeux de ton visage
Et ne peux m'empêcher
De penser à demain
Qui s'annonce déjà
Comme un mauvais orage
Qui lavera nos rires
A l'eau de mon chagrin

J'ai le cœur déchiré
Et j'ai mal de comprendre
Que les mots que tu dis
Veulent tous dire adieu
Je regarde sans voir
J'écoute sans entendre
Le chagrin me surprend
Debout silencieux

Je rêve de passé
Quand le présent t'emporte
Qu'il ne me reste plus
Qu'à te serrer la main
Je voudrais la garder
Mais nos amours sont mortes
A deux pas de mon cœur
Tu es déjà si loin

C'est fini fini fini fini fini fini fini

Se peut-il qu'un bonheur
Qui tenait tant de place
Et donnait tant de joie
Disparaisse à jamais
Effaçant de ta vie
Même jusqu'à la trace
Du moindre souvenir
Que l'amour nous a fait

Je ne sais comment faire
Et je ne sais que dire
Je veux paraître fort
Une dernière fois
Les larmes au coin des yeux
Je me force à sourire
D'un sourire forcé
Qui ne te trompe pas

Trop lâche pour mourir
Bien qu'effrayé de vivre
Je compte sur l'oubli
Pour trouver le repos
Il faudra m'habituer
Dans les années à suivre
A des jours sans ta voix
A des nuits sans ta peau

Charles Aznavour,"Une enfant,
Une enfant de seize ans,
Une enfant du printemps,
Couché sur les chemins.

Elle vivait dans un de ces quartiers
Ou tout le monde riche a crevé.
Elle avait quitté ses parents
Pour suivre un garçon, un bohème,
Qui savait signer et dire je t'aime,
Et sans que ça devenait bouleversant,
Et leur cœurs parait-il sans laisser d'adresse,
Emportant juste la jeunesse
Et le douceur de leur pêché.

Une enfant

Leurs cœurs n'avaient pas le saison
Et ne voulaient pas de prison.
Tout de vivait au jour de jour,
Restant jamais à la même place.
Leurs cœurs avaient besoin d'espace
Pour contenir un tel amour.
Son présent comme son futur,
C'était cet amour magnifique,
Qu'il avait refait un cantique
Et perdit ses yeux dans l'azure.

Une enfant

Mais son amour était trop grande,
Trop grande pour l'âme d'une enfant.
Elle ne vivait que par son cœur
Et son cœur faisait un monde,
Mais Dieu n'acceptait pas le monde
Quand Il n'est pas le créateur.
L'amour était leur seul festin
Et la guitare pour quelques miettes,
Alors sa vie bâtit en retraite
Et puis l'enfant connaît la fin.

Une enfant, un printemps,
Couché sur le chemin.",Une Enfant
Charles Aznavour,"Je bois pour oublier mes années d'infortune
Et cette vie commune
Avec toi mais si seul
Je bois pour me donner l'illusion que j'existe
Puisque trop égoïste
Pour me péter la gueule

Et je lève mon verre à nos cœurs en faillite
Nos illusions détruites
A ma fuite en avant
Et je trinque à l'enfer qui dans mon foie s'impose
En bouquet de cirrhose
Que j'arrose en buvant

Je bois jour après jour à tes fautes, à mes fautes
Au temps que côte à côte
Il nous faut vivre encore
Je bois à nos amours ambiguës, diaboliques
Souvent tragi-comiques
Nos silences de mort

A notre union ratée, mesquine et pitoyable
A ton corps insatiable
Roulant de lit en lit
A ce serment, preté la main sur l'Evangile
A ton ventre stérile
Qui n'eut jamais de fruit

Je bois pour échapper à ma vie insipide
Je bois jusqu'au suicide
Le dégoût , la torpeur
Je bois pour m'enivrer et vomir mes principes
Libérant de mes tripes
Ce que j'ai sur le cœur

Au bonheur avorté, à moi et mes complexes
A toi, tout feu, tout sexe
A tes nombreux amants

A ma peau boursouflée, striée de couperose
Et à la ménopause
Qui te guette au tournant

Je bois aux lois bénies de la vie conjugale
Qui de peur du scandale
Poussent à faire semblant
Je bois jusqu'à la lie aux étreintes sommaires
Aux putes exemplaires
Aux froids accouplements

Au meilleur de la vie qui par lambeaux nous quitte
A cette cellulite
Dont ton corps se rempare
Au devoir accompli comme deux automates
Aux ennuis de prostate
Que j'aurai tôt ou tard

Je bois à en crever et peu à peu j'en crève
Comme ont crevé mes reves
Quand l'amour m'a trahi
Je bois à m'en damner le foie comme une éponge
Car le mal qui me ronge
Est le mal de l'oubli

Je m'enivre surtout pour mieux noyer ma peine
Et conjurer la haine
Dont nous sommes la proie
Et je bois comme un trou qu'est en tout point semblable
A celui que le diable
Te fait creuser pour moi

Je bois mon Dieu, je bois
Un peu par habitude
Beaucoup de solitude
Et pour t'oublier toi
Et pour t'emmerder toi

Charles Aznavour,"On sait jamais
Comment l'amour vient aux amants
Comment il fait ou il s'y prend
Pour nous tenir dans ses filets
Mais tout à coup c'est merveilleux
Il y a des larmes plein nos joies
Des caresses au bout de nos doigts
Et des rêves au fond de nos yeux
On ne sait jamais
Mais pourquoi chercher à savoir
Nul n'a jamais eu ce pouvoir
On oublie tout quand l'amour naît
Plus rien ne peut nous retenir
Et fou d'amour et de désir
On se dit tant pis
Si l'on ne sait jamais

On ne sait jamais
Quand on est pris par le bonheur
Si c'est l'esprit ou bien le cœur
Qui nous apporte ce bienfait
On a confiance en l'avenir
C'est à la vie comme à la mort
Et tant pis si l'on a eu tort
On met ça dans les souvenirs
On ne sait jamais
Et l'on se fiche éperdument
Du qui, du quoi, et du comment
On est heureux comme l'on est
Plus rien ne compte à notre vue
Que ce bonheur à cœur perdu
Qui nous dit
Tant pis
Si l'on ne sait jamais

On ne sait jamais
L'amour fait de nous ce qu'il veut
On est heureux ou malheureux
Tout est parfait ou rien n'est vrai
Parfois il reprend d'une main
Ce que de l'autre il a donné
Mais quand tout semble s'écrouler
Lorsque l'on croit n'avoir rien
On ne sait jamais
Nos yeux sont à peine séchés
Qu'un autre amour vient à s'annoncer
Et tout est à recommencer

A chaque fois comme à vingt ans

Au cours de notre vie
Tout ça parce qu'on ne sait jamais.",On Ne Sait Jamais
Charles Aznavour,"Hier encore, j'avais vingt ans, je caressais le temps
J'ai joué de la vie
Comme on joue de l'amour et je vivais la nuit
Sans compter sur mes jours qui fuyaient dans le temps
J'ai fait tant de projets qui sont restés en l'air
J'ai fondé tant d'espoirs qui se sont envolés
Que je reste perdu, ne sachant où aller
Les yeux cherchant le ciel, mais le cœur mis en terre

Hier encore, j'avais vingt ans, je gaspillais le temps
En croyant l'arrêter
Et pour le retenir, même le devancer
Je n'ai fait que courir et me suis essoufflé
Ignorant le passé, conjuguant au futur
Je précédais de moi toute conversation
Et donnais mon avis que je voulais le bon
Pour critiquer le monde avec désinvolture
Hier encore, j'avais vingt ans mais j'ai perdu mon temps
À faire des folies
Qui me laissent au fond rien de vraiment précis
Que quelques rides au front et la peur de l'ennui
Car mes amours sont mortes avant que d'exister
Mes amis sont partis et ne reviendront pas
Par ma faute j'ai fait le vide autour de moi
Et j'ai gâché ma vie et mes jeunes années
Du meilleur et do pire en jetant le meilleur
J'ai figé mes sourires et j'ai glacé mes pleurs
Où sont-ils à présent?

Charles Aznavour,"Il y avait un garçon qui vivait simplement,
Travaillant dans le faubourg.
Il y avait une fille qui rêvait simplement
En attendant l'amour.
Il y avait le printemps,
Le printemps des romans
Qui passait en chantant
Et cherchait deux cœurs troublants
Pour prêter ses serments
Et en faire des amants.

Il y a eu un moment merveilleux,
Lorsque leurs regards se sont unis.
Il y a eu ces instants délicieux
Où, sans rien dire, ils se son compris.
Il y a eu le destin
Qui a poussé le gamin
A lui prendre la main.
Il y a eu la chaleur,
La chaleur du bonheur
Qui leur montait au cœur.

Il y avait cette chambre meublée
Aux fenêtres donnant sur la cour.
Il y avait ce couple qui s'aimait
Et leurs phrases parlaient de toujours.
Il y avait le gamin
Qui promenait sa main
Dans les cheveux de lin
De la fille aux yeux rêveurs
Tandis que dans leur cœur
S'installait le bonheur.

Il y a eu ces deux corps éperdus
De bonheur, de joies sans pareils.
Il y a eu tous les rêves perdus
Qui remplaçaient leurs nuits sans sommeil.
Il y a eu le moment
Où, soudain, le printemps
A repris ses serments.
Il y a eu le bonheur
Qui s'est enfui en pleurs

Que les moins de vingt ans

Jusque sous nos fenêtres
Et si l'humble garni

Qui attendions la gloire
Et bien que miséreux
Avec le ventre creux
Nous ne cessions d'y croire
Et quand quelque bistro
Contre un bon repas chaud
Nous prenait une toile
Nous récitions des vers
Groupés autour du poêle
En oubliant l'hiver

La bohème, la bohème
Ça voulait dire
Tu es jolie
La bohème, la bohème
Et nous avions tous du génie

Souvent il m'arrivait
Devant mon chevalet
De passer des nuits blanches
Retouchant le dessin
De la ligne d'un sein
du galbe d'une hanche
Et ce n'est qu'au matin
Qu'on s'asseyait enfin
Devant un café-crème
Épuisés mais ravis
Fallait-il que l'on s'aime
Et qu'on aime la vie

Dans un très vieil appartement rue Sarasate
J'ai pour me tenir compagnie
Une tortue deux canaris et une chatte.
Pour laisser maman reposer
Très souvent je fais le marché et la cuisine
Je range, je lave et j'essuie,
A l'occasion je pique aussi à la machine.
Le travail ne me fait pas peur
Je suis un peu décorateur un peu styliste
Mais mon vrai métier c'est la nuit.
Que je l'exerce travesti, je suis artiste.
Jai un numéro très spécial
Qui finit en nu intégral après strip-tease,
Et dans la salle je vois que
Les mâles n'en croient pas leurs yeux.
Je suis un homo comme ils disent.

Vers les trois heures du matin
On va manger entre copains de tous les sexes
Dans un quelconque bar-tabac
Et là on s'en donne à cœur joie et sans complexe
On déballe des vérités
Sur des gens qu'on a dans le nez, on les lapide.
Mais on le fait avec humour
Enrobés dans des calembours mouillés d'acide
On rencontre des attardés
Qui pour épater leurs tablées marchent et ondulent
Singeant ce qu'ils croient être nous
Et se couvrent, les pauvres fous, de ridicule
Ça gesticule et parle fort.
Ça joue les divas, les ténors de la bêtise.

Me laissent froid puisque c'est vrai.

Je rentre retrouver mon lot de solitude.

Comme un pauvre clown malheureux de lassitude.
Je me couche mais je ne dors pas
Je pense à mes amours sans joie si dérisoires.
A ce garçon beau comme un Dieu
Qui sans rien faire a mis le feu à ma mémoire.
Ma bouche n'osera jamais
Lui avouer mon doux secret mon tendre drame
Car l'objet de tous mes tourments
Passe le plus clair de son temps au lit des femmes
Nul n'a le droit en vérité
De me blâmer de me juger et je précise
Que c'est bien la nature qui
Est seule responsable si

Si tout va de ce train, la soirée au théâtre
Et l'auteur à la mode, on s’en fera un deuil
Adieu pièce d’anouilh, d’anouilh, ou bien de sartre
Je ne sais plus très bien, mais j’ai deux bons fauteuils

Bon anniversaire
Bon anniversaire

Ta robe est arrivée, enfin, et tu respires
Moi pour gagner du temps je t'aide de mon mieux
Tout semble s'arranger mais soudain c'est le pire
La fermeture éclair s’arrête au beau milieu
On s'énerve tous deux, on pousse et puis l’on tire
On s'y mêle les doigts, on y met tant d’ardeur
Que dans un bruit affreux, le tissu se déchire
Et je vois tes espoirs se transformer en pleurs
Aux environs d'onze heures, enfin te voilà prête
Mais le temps d'arriver le théâtre est fermé
Viens nous irons souper tous deux en tête à tête
Non, tu as le coeur gros et préfère rentrer
Par les rues lentement, nous marchons en silence
Tu souris, je t'embrasse, et tu souris encore,
La soirée est gâchée, mais on a de la chance
Puisque nous nous aimons, l'amour est le plus fort

Bon anniversaire
Bon anniversaire
Bon anniversaire",Bon Anniversaire
Charles Aznavour,"J'habite seul avec maman
Dans un très vieil appartement rue Sarasate
J'ai pour me tenir compagnie
Une tortue deux canaris et une chatte.
Pour laisser maman reposer
Très souvent je fais le marché et la cuisine
Je range, je lave et j'essuie,
A l'occasion je pique aussi à la machine.
Le travail ne me fait pas peur
Je suis un peu décorateur un peu styliste
Mais mon vrai métier c'est la nuit.
Que je l'exerce travesti, je suis artiste.
Jai un numéro très spécial
Qui finit en nu intégral après strip-tease,
Et dans la salle je vois que
Les mâles n'en croient pas leurs yeux.
Je suis un homo comme ils disent.

Vers les trois heures du matin
On va manger entre copains de tous les sexes
Dans un quelconque bar-tabac
Et là on s'en donne à cœur joie et sans complexe
On déballe des vérités
Sur des gens qu'on a dans le nez, on les lapide.
Mais on le fait avec humour
Enrobés dans des calembours mouillés d'acide
On rencontre des attardés
Qui pour épater leurs tablées marchent et ondulent
Singeant ce qu'ils croient être nous
Et se couvrent, les pauvres fous, de ridicule
Ça gesticule et parle fort.
Ça joue les divas, les ténors de la bêtise.
Moi les lazzi, les quolibets
Me laissent froid puisque c'est vrai.
Je suis un homo comme ils disent.

A l'heure où naît un jour nouveau
Je rentre retrouver mon lot de solitude.
J'ôte mes cils et mes cheveux
Comme un pauvre clown malheureux de lassitude.
Je me couche mais je ne dors pas
Je pense à mes amours sans joie si dérisoires.
A ce garçon beau comme un Dieu
Qui sans rien faire a mis le feu à ma mémoire.
Ma bouche n'osera jamais
Lui avouer mon doux secret mon tendre drame
Car l'objet de tous mes tourments
Passe le plus clair de son temps au lit des femmes
Nul n'a le droit en vérité
De me blâmer de me juger et je précise
Que c'est bien la nature qui
Est seule responsable si
Je suis un ""homme oh"" comme ils disent.
...",Comme Ils Disent
Charles Aznavour,"Désormais
On ne nous verra plus ensemble
Désormais
Mon cœur vivra sous les décombres
De ce monde qui nous ressemble
Et que le temps a dévasté
désormais
Ma voix ne dira plus je t'aime 
Désormais
Moi qui voulais être ton ombre 
Je serai l'ombre de moi-même 
Ma main de ta main séparée

Jamais plus
Nous ne mordrons au même fruit 
Ne dormirons au même lit
Ne referons les mêmes gestes 
Jamais plus
Ne connaîtrons la même peur
De voir s'enfuir notre bonheur 
Et du reste
Désormais

Désormais
Les gens nous verrons l'un sans l'autre 
Désormais
Nous changerons nos habitudes 
Et ces mots que je croyais nôtres 
Tu les diras dans d'autres bras 
Désormais
Je garderai ma porte close Désormais
Enfermé dans ma solitude 
Je traînerai parmi les choses 
Qui parleront toujours de toi",Desormais
Charles Aznavour,"Vers les docks où le poids et l'ennui 
Me courbent le dos 
Ils arrivent le ventre alourdi 
De fruits les bateaux 

Ils viennent du bout du monde 
Apportant avec eux 
Des idées vagabondes 
Aux reflets de ciels bleus 
De mirages 

Traînant un parfum poivré 
De pays inconnus 
Et d'éternels étés 
Où l'on vit presque nus 
Sur les plages 

Moi qui n'ai connu toute ma vie 
Que le ciel du nord 
J'aimerais débarbouiller ce gris 
En virant de bord 

Emmenez-moi au bout de la terre 
Emmenez-moi au pays des merveilles 
Il me semble que la misère 
Serait moins pénible au soleil 

Dans les bars à la tombée du jour 
Avec les marins 
Quand on parle de filles et d'amour 
Un verre à la main 

Je perds la notion des choses 
Et soudain ma pensée 
M'enlève et me dépose 
Un merveilleux été 
Sur la grève 

Où je vois tendant les bras 
L'amour qui comme un fou 
Court au devant de moi 
Et je me pends au cou 
De mon rêve 

Quand les bars ferment, que les marins 
Rejoignent leur bord 
Moi je rêve encore jusqu'au matin 
Debout sur le port 

Emmenez-moi au bout de la terre 
Emmenez-moi au pays des merveilles 
Il me semble que la misère 
Serait moins pénible au soleil 

Un beau jour sur un rafiot craquant 
De la coque au pont 
Pour partir je travaillerais dans 
La soute à charbon 

Prenant la route qui mène 
A mes rêves d'enfant 
Sur des îles lointaines 
Où rien n'est important 
Que de vivre 

Où les filles alanguies 
Vous ravissent le cœur 
En tressant m'a t'on dit 
De ces colliers de fleurs 
Qui enivrent 

Je fuirais laissant là mon passé 
Sans aucun remords 
Sans bagage et le cœur libéré 
En chantant très fort 

Emmenez-moi au bout de la terre 
Emmenez-moi au pays des merveilles 
Il me semble que la misère 
Serait moins pénible au soleil",Emmenez-Moi
Charles Aznavour,"Je sais qu'un jour viendra car la vie le commande
Ce jour que j'appréhende où tu nous quitteras
Je sais qu'un jour viendra où triste et solitaire
En soutenant ta mère et en traînant mes pas
Je rentrerai chez nous dans un ""chez nous"" désert
Je rentrerai chez nous où tu ne seras pas.

Toi tu ne verras rien des choses de mon cœur
Tes yeux seront crevés de joie et de bonheur
Et j'aurai un rictus que tu ne connais pas
Qui semble être un sourire ému mais ne l'est pas
En taisant ma douleur à ton bras fièrement
Je guiderai tes pas quoique j'en pense ou dise
Dans le recueillement d'une paisible église
Pour aller te donner à l'homme de ton choix
Qui te dévêtira du nom qui est le nôtre
Pour t'en donner un autre que je ne connais pas.

Je sais qu'un jour viendra tu atteindras cet âge
Où l'on force les cages ayant trouvé sa voie
Je sais qu'un jour viendra, l'âge t'aura fleurie
Et l'aube de ta vie ailleurs se lèvera
Et seul avec ta mère le jour comme la nuit
L'été comme l'hiver nous aurons un peu froid.

Et lui qui ne sait rien du mal qu'on s'est donné
Lui qui n'aura rien fait pour mûrir tes années
Lui qui viendra voler ce dont j'ai le plus peur
Notre part de passé, notre part de bonheur
Cet étranger sans nom, sans visage
Oh! combien je le hais
Et pourtant s'il doit te rendre heureuse
Je n'aurai envers lui nulle pensée haineuse
Mais je lui offrirai mon cœur avec ta main
Je ferai tout cela en sachant que tu l'aimes
Simplement car JE T'AIME
Le jour, où il viendra.",A Ma Fille
