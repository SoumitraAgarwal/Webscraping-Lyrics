Eddi Reader,"In a paparazzi photograph she was stepping from a car
The tired eyes betrayed the smile of the faded singing star
At the publishers reception on the launching of her book
She told the grimy details and the toll the details took
The tours, applause, awards of course
But as the years went by, those fundamental things still applied
Oh but she thought she'd be the exception
Oh yes she thought she'd be the exception
But don't we all think we're the exception
Sometimes, sometimes

The workaholic millionaire and his pretty younger wife
Had everything there was out there in the ad mans perfect life
But she left him for the milkman and then moved into his flat
Everyone said silly girl to do a thing like that
The house, the cars, the credit cards but he didn't ask her why
He knows that there's some things even cash can't buy
Oh yes he thought he'd be the exception
Oh yes he thought he'd be the exception
But don't we all think we're the exception
Sometimes, sometimes

If a handout to the hungry and the homeless
Is a fiver in the fickle hand of fate
Does it mean we'll be there on the guest list
When we get to heaven's gate

No pain, no gain, that's what they're saying and it's hard to disagree
But I thought somehow they weren't including me
Oh but I thought I'd be the exception
Oh yes I thought I'd be the exception
But don't we all think we're the exception
Sometimes, sometimes

Eddi Reader,"The lights are on our side, driving out of town tonight
This night the colour of blue glass
The warm wind is in our hair, summertime is everywhere
It's funny how today just flew past
I've been in the wrong place, I've been in the wrong place
Long enough to know I'm in the right place now

Five or ten lifetimes ago, there lived a girl that you don't know
She walked about and answered to my name
But let's not talk of strangers now, of where and when or why and how
I've turned around and I'm looking at a new day
I've been in the wrong place, I've been in the wrong place
Long enough to know I'm in the right place now

I've been waiting so long, I've been waiting so long
I've been waiting so long
Now I don't mind if the sun goes down
The night can't hurt me now
The summer's young and the road is clear
I thank whatever brought me here
I've been in the wrong place, I've been in the wrong place
Long enough to know I'm in the right place now
I'm in the right place now

Eddi Reader,"I've got a lazy heart
Can't make it do a thing
Won't go to church on Sundays
I've never heard it sing
No matter what I do
Can't make my heart want you

I've got a lazy heart
Sleeps when the morning comes
Sleep through an earthquake
Walk and never run
I don't know what to say
It's always been that way

My lazy heart and I
Are hostage to the moon
And winter's far too long
And summer ends too soon

Goddamn my lazy heart
It's dumb as an ox I know
Won't go to work on Mondays
Just can't make it go
Whatever's to be done?
My heart cannot be won

I'm not the one to blame
So please don't make me choose
Between a living lie
And the I'm so sorry blues",Lazy Heart
Eddi Reader,"The blue around the morning moon 
The color of your eyes
I remember holding you 
A fall through summer skies

In every word I say
I need a bell, book and candle

White horses on a troubled sea

Eddi Reader,"When you're young and so in love as we
And bewildered by the world we see
Why do people get a soul
Ony those in love would know
What a town without pity can do

If we stop to gaze upon a star
People talk about how ""bad"" we are
Ours is not an easy age
We're like tigers in a cage
What a town without pity can do

The young have problems
Many problems
We need an understanding heart
Why don't they help us
Try to help us
Before this plain granted planet falls apart

Take these eager lips and hold me fast
I'm afraid this kind of joy can't last
How can we keep love alive
How can anything survive
When these little minds tear you in two
What a town without pity can do

Eddi Reader,"Ae fond kiss and then we sever
Ae fareweel, alas for ever
Deep in heart-wrung tears I’ll pledge thee
Warring sighs and groans I’ll wage thee

Who shall say that fortune grieves him
While the star of hope she leaves him
Me, nae cheerful twinkle lights me
Dark despair around benights me

I’ll ne’er blame my partial fancy
Nothing can resist my Nancy
For to see her was to love her
Love but her, and love for ever

Had we never loved sae kindly
Had we never loved sae blindly
Nor never met, nor never parted
We would never have been so broken-hearted

Fare thee weel, my first and fairest
Fare thee weel, my best and dearest
Thine be like joy and treasure…

Ae fareweel alas, for ever

Eddi Reader,"Galileo fell in love
As a Galilean boy
And he wondered what in heavens
Who'd invented such a joy.
but the question got the better
Of his scientific mind
And to his blind and dying day
He'd look up high and often sigh and sometimes cry

Who puts the rainbows in the sky?
Who lights the stars at night?
Who dreamt up someone so divine
Someone like you who made them mine?

Love can make you ask some funny questions now and then

But just remember the alternative
For I remember when

I was lonely and unhappy
And my lips were cold as ice
Still you kissed me
And good heavens
Now I'm here in paradise
So if ever I'm not kissing you or
Looking in your eyes
I won't be blind
And I won't cry
I'll look up high and gladly sigh and thank the guy
Who put the rainbows in the sky.",Galileo (Someone Like You)

You speak and I hear violins

And rush to nestle in your eyes

Without a golden wand
Or mystic charms
Fantastic things begin
When I am in your arms

When we walk hand in hand

In captivation my eyes are wide with her words
So much respect in here

With one step forward she leads me by the hand

We all must die

Wrap them up in fire with your love

Grab all you can take everything in sight
Don't care if I sit here forever
Holding nothing but my heart

I wasn't dressed up like Henry Ford
But I was feeling just as fine
I caught her sitting on another man's knee
And I didn't like that sign
Well, I told them what I thought about it, boys
And I got mine

I got mine, I got mine
I grabbed my hat and through the window
I went flying
I ran as fast as I could run
But I didn't get there in time
Because the rascal grabbed a shotgun, Lord
And I got mine

Eddie Adcock,"Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains

""Oh!"" she said, ""Casey it's been so long since I've seen you!""
""Here"" she said, ""just a kiss to make a body smile!""
""See"" she said, ""I've put on new stockings just to please you!""
""Lord!"" she said, ""Casey can you only stay a while?""

Casey leaves the under-ground and stops inside the Golden Crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home
Standin' in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye

""Oh!"" she said, ""I suppose you seldom think about me
""Now"" she said, ""now that you've a fam'ly of your own""
""Still"" she said, ""it's so blessed good to feel your body!""

You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,

Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above

Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears
Wish you were here",September Song [Performed Live on the Ed Sullivan Show 12/29/68]

Eddie Calvert,"Just got back from Paris France
All they do is sing and dance
All they got is romance
What a tragedy

Every boulevard has lovers
Every lover's in a trance
The poor people of Paris
I feel sorry for the French

Every guy has got a wench
Every couple's got a bench kissing shamelessly
Night and day they're making music
While they're making love in French

The poor people of Paris
Milk or water from a sink
Make a true Parisian shrink
Wine is all he'll ever drink

And it worries me
For with wine as cheap as water
Oh it makes one stop and think
The poor people of Paris

Sister Madam Pierre
Had the craziest love affair
And the day after they parted there
He cries bitterly

Pierre was there to bid her farewell
But he brought his new girl Claire

And for laying firm hold of the possibilities for good in me
Why do I love you I love you for closing your eyes to the dischords
And for adding to the music in me by worshipful listening
I love you because you're helping to make of the lumber of my life
Not a tavern but a temple
And out of the words of my everyday not a reproach but a song
I love you because you have done more than any creed to make me happy

Like the kicker in a julep or two

That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

Like an old coat that is tattered and torn
Left in this wide world to weep and to mourn 
Betrayed by a maid in her teens
Oh, this maid that I loved she was handsome
And I tried all I knew, her to please 
But I never could please her one quarter so well 
As the man on the flying trapeze!
 
He floats thro' the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
He'd play with a miss like a cat with a mouse
His eyes would undress ev'ry maid in the house
Perhaps he is better described as a louse
But still people came just the same
He'd smile on the bar to the people below
And one night he smiled on my love
She blew him a kiss and she hollered ""Bravo""! 
As he hung by his nose up above!
 
He floats thro' the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
I wept and I whimpered I simpered for weeks 
While she spent her time the with the circuses freaks
The tears were like hailstones that rolled down my cheeks
Alas and alack and Alaska
I went to this fellow the blackguard and said 
I'll see that you get your deserts
His thumb to his nose he put up with a sneer  
He sneered once again and said ""Nortz"" Oh!
 
He floats thro' the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
One night to his tent he invited her in 
Filled her with compliments and kisses and gin
That started her off on the road to ruin 
She made the supreme sacrifice
But even tho' I loved her I said ""Take my name  
I'll gladly forgive and forget!""
She rustled her bustle and then without shame she said
""Maybe later , not yet""!  Oh!
 
He floats thro' the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
One night I as usual went to her dear home
Found there her father and mother alone 
I asked for my love and soon t'was made known
To my horror that she'd run away
Without any trousseau she fled in the night 
With him with the greatest of ease
From two stories high he had lowered her down 
To the ground on his flying trapeze!
 
He floats through the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
Some months after that I went into the hall 
To my surprise I found there on the wall
A bill in red letters which did my heart gall 
That she was appearing with him
He'd taught her gymnastics and dressed her in tights 
To help him to live at his ease
He'd made her assume a masculine name 
And now she goes on the trapeze!
 
She floats through the air with the greatest of ease
You'd think her a man on the flying trapeze
Her actions are graceful, all girls she does please 
And that's what's become of my love

Eddie Cantor,"Place park, scene dark, silvery moon is shining through the trees;
Cast two, me, you, sound of kisses floating on the breeze.
Act one, begun. Dialogue, ""Where would you like to spoon?""
My cue, with you, underneath the silvery moon.

By the light of the silvery moon,
I want to spoon, to my honey I'll croon love's tune,
Honeymoon keep a shining in June,
Your silvery beams will bring love dreams, we'll be cuddling soon,
By the silvery moon.

Act two, scene new, roses blooming all around the place;
Cast three, you, me, Preacher with a solemn looking face.
Choir sings, bell rings,Preacher: ""You are wed for evermore.""

Eddie Cantor,"""Nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina""

Wishing is good time wasted,
Still it's a habit they say;
Wishing for sweet's I've tasted,
That's all I do all day.
Maybe there's nothing in wishing,
But, speaking of wishing I'll say:

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

No one could be sweeter
Than my sweetie when I meet her
In the morning.

When the morning glories
Twine around the door
Whispering pretty stories
I long to hear once more
Strolling with my girlie
Where the dew is pearly early
In the morning.

Butterflies all flutter up
And kiss each little buttercup
At dawning.
If I had Alladin's lamp
For only a day
I'd make a wish
And here's what I'd say

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

Dreaming was meant for night time
I live in dreams all the day; 
I know it's not the right time,
But still I dream away
What could be sweeter than dreaming,
Just dreaming and drift away. 

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

No one could be sweeter
Than my sweetie when I meet her
In the morning.

When the morning glories
Twine around the door
Whispering pretty stories
I long to hear once more
Strolling with my girlie
Where the dew is pearly early
In the morning.

Butterflies all flutter up
And kiss each little buttercup
At dawning.
If I had Alladin's lamp
For only a day
I'd make a wish
And here's what I'd say

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.",Carolina in the Morning
Eddie Chamblee,"We meet, and the angels sing
The angels sing the sweetest song I ever heard
You speak, and the angels sing
Or am I breathing music into every word

Suddenly, the setting is strange
I can see water and moonlight beaming
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore - Then
Suddenly, I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore.

You smile, and the angels sing
And though it's just a gentle murmur at the start
We kiss, and the angels sing
And leave their music ringing in my heart.",And the Angels Sing
Eddie Chamblee,"Every day seems like a year
Sweetheart, when you are not near
All that you claim must be true
For I'm just the same as you

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?
I'm happy when I'm with you

Stars are smiling at me from your eyes
Sunbeams now there will be in the skies
Tell me that you will be true
That will all depend on you

Without a song the road would never bend
When things go wrong, a man ain't got a friend

That field of corn would never see a plow
That field of corn would be deserted now
A man is born but he's no good no-how
Without a song

I got my troubles and woe but sure as I know that Jordan will roll
I'll get along as long as a song is strong in my soul
I'll never know what makes the rain to fall
I'll never know what makes the grass so tall
I only know there ain't no love at all

Eddie Chamblee,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Step two, she falls in love with you
Step three, you kiss and hold her tightly

 La da da, da da da, da da (repeated) 
 Aiyo, this next song is dedicated to the memory of Erik Shrody 
 Rest in peace, we ain't forget about you, you fuckin homo 
 We still remember 
 There once was a man who liked to jump around (jump around) 
 But he got too old to jump up and down (up and down) 
 (so then what happened?) 
 So he put the mic down and picked the guitar up (picked the guitar up) 
 (and then he what?) 
 Started singin the blues like there no tomorrow (no tomorrow) 
 (come on) Left his boys in the house of pain (the house of pain) 
 It was the wisest decision he ever made (ever made) 
 But the dumbest thing he could ever do (could ever do) 
 Was try to buck a 380 on those who act shady 
 Tell me now what you gonna do (now what you gonna do) 
 [chorus] 
 Cause I remember all those years 
 How it was when you were here 
 I remember how it was, how it was when you were young 
 Yesterday was so long ago (long ago) 
 Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now 
 Don't nobody want to hear your old ass sing no more 
 I remember back when you had The Knack (had the knack) 
 And i remember when you had your first heart attack (heart attack) 
 I was right there laughin when I heard the news (heard the news) 
 I just wish the cardiac would'a murdered you (would'a murdered you) 
 Maybe Ice-T's right, you are a bitch (you are a bitch) 
 You come around when you're broke and you leave when you're rich 
 But the dumbest thing he could ever do (could ever do) 
 Was try to buck a 380 on those who act shady 
 Tell me now what you gonna do (now what you gonna do) 
 [chorus] 
 yo (yo) yo (yo) yo (yo) 
 Remember back in '94, like right before Ms. Everlast was Whitey Ford 
 Before his heart attack had him on life support 
 When house of pain was out of fame like someone doused the flame 
 And they became destined to never jump around again 
 Or even further back, when i first had heard The Knack 
 And you were down with Syndicate, I went to get your shit, man 
 I was into it 
 But then you went and took your style and switched the shit 
 Now you sound ridiculous you dickless piece of shit, 
 How could you diss me, bitch? 
 I liked you, thought you was alright for a white dude, 
 Remember Sway and Tech when I came up and sat beside you 
 Started rhymin, then you left the room 
 and didn't say goodbye or nothin? 
 Like you was mad that someone else was 
 White and tried to rhyme or somethin 
 I'm sorry man, I wasn't tryin to steal your light or nothin 
 But you're a homosexual, white rappin Irish {*faggot*?} 
 Man I wish I was irish, I could be a {*faggot*?} too 
 Then I'd be confused as you, and I wouldn't know what to do 
 What's up with you? 
 I never fucked with you, why would you fuck with me? 
 Knowin I could rap circles around you, what, are you as nuts as me? 
 Plus I can sing better than you and I don't fuckin sing 
 And probably play guitar better, and I ain't never touched a string 
 But I ain't mad at you, I'd hate me too if I was you 
 I'm what you used to be, shit you was me in '92 
 So everytime I write a lyric, I'mma think of you 
 And maybe that will help me know what it's like to sing the blues 
 [chorus]x2 
 You fuckin punk, pussy, you fuckin faggot, sissy, fuck 
 And by the way, a 380's a fuckin sissy gun 
 If you're gonna shoot somebody use a fuckin real gun 
 You little bitch 
 Next time say my fuckin name in a song 
 Don't be subliminal about it 
 You want to fuckin diss me, diss me you fuckin faggot 
 You fuckin punk, pussy, you fuckin little bitch, fuckin cunt

Eddie Cochran,"Let me tell you about a girl I know,
She's my baby and I love her so.
Every morning when the sun comes up,
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup.
That's why I know, yes I know,
Hallelujah I just love her so.
When I call her on the telephone,
She says baby, I'm all alone.
By the time I count from one to four,
She'll be knocking on my door.
In the evening when the sun goes down
And there ain't nobody else around,
She kisses me and she holds me tight.
She says baby everything is alright.
That's why I know, that's why I know

Packin' his guitar
Stops at jelly bean's house

Bows his head and bends his knees

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light

Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,

She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,

End it all and let her go to some better man;

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Eddie Constantine,"Quand je me souviens de ma bell' enfance
Et des boniments que j'ai entendus
Sur le mois de mai et ses espérances
J'étais l'oiselet piégé dans la glu
J'étais un' enfant c'est incontestable
Mais un' enfant moch' comm' je ne sais quoi
Par définition un' enfant coupable
Quêtant l'aventur' l' soir au coin d'un bois

Au coin de ce bois pleurant la chevêche
Elle en avait l'air mais cett' garce-là
Au lieu de gémir se riait d' ma dèche
Et de mes pieds nus bleuis par le froid
Un' nuit j'aperçus aux branches d'un chêne
Deux ou trois pendus en guis' de pavois
Des freux ressemblaient à des fruits d'ébène
Alors j'esquissais le sign' de la Croix

C'était le chef-d'oeuvre d'un grand capitaine
Qui peuplait l' pays de ses souvenirs
J'étais bien trop jeune pour sentir ma peine;
Ça n' m'empêchait pas de me rendormir.
Les marpaults venus d'un pauvre village
Galopaient la nuit de peur des narquois.
Mais moi j'attendais sans doute un beau page
Vêtu d'écarlat', coiffé comm' un roi.

La nature est bonn' pour tout ce qui bouge;
Plus tard un vaurien m'a pris' par la main.
Ceux du coin du bois l'app'laient d'Auneau l' Rouge;
Il m'a dit : "" Saut' gueus', le lit est dans l' foin ""
Ce fut la kermess' tendre et libertine
Jusqu'au jour maudit où j' le vis tout droit
Dans l'aube livid' quand la guillotine
Tendait ses deux bras devant le beffroi

Alors comme il faut un' fin à tout's choses,
Aussi décrépit' qu'un hibou tondu,
Je suis revenue reprendre ma pose
A l'orée du bois du bon temps perdu.
C'est l'heure de la fin pour les vieill's drôlesses
Je ne vaux pas plus qu'un fagot d' bois mort
C'est peut-êtr' l'imag' d'un' vie sans sagesse
Mais pour la sagess'... c'était pas mon fort.",La Fille des Bois

I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Eddie Dean,"Somewhere, my love there will be songs to sing
Although the snow covers the hope of spring
Somewhere a hill blossoms in green and gold
And there are dreams all that your heart can hold

Someday we'll meet again my love
Someday whenever the spring breaks through

You'll come to me out of the long ago
Warm as the wind, soft as the kiss of snow
Lara my own, think of me now and then
God speed my love till you are mine again

You'll come to me out of the long ago

Eddie Dillon,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

And the tulip trees are blooming

And the farmer leaves his reaping
In the meadow cows are sleeping
And the speckled trout stop leaping up stream
As we dream
A fat pink cloud hangs over the hill
Unfolding like a rose

And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,

Though my world may go awry
In my heart will ever lie
Just an echo of a sigh
Goodbye",I'll See You Again
Eddie Fisher,"It's only human for anyone to want to be in love
But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out
And rack your brains

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as she
Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as he
Should cause you such misery and pain

I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.",In Love in Vain
Eddie Fisher,"This is hard to say, but as I wandered through the lea
I felt for just a fleeting moment that I was suddenly free of being lonely;
Then I closed my eyes and saw the very reason why.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man walking by the sea
Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man walking by the sea
Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.

Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:
There but for you go I.
",There But for You Go I
Eddie Fisher,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you.",Time on My Hands
Eddie Fisher,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty",You Are Too Beautiful
Eddie Fisher,"You're my girl the boys all know
You're my girl, I've told them so
You should have seen how their faces fell
When they were wishing me well
They called me a lucky guy
And I couldn't hide a feeling of pride

You're my girl, I've chosen you
To be mine my whole life through
And if this heart of mine had a voice
You'd hear it second my choice
You're what I've waited for and you're my girl

If this heart of mine had a voice
You'd hear it second my choice
You're what I've waited for and you're my girl",You're My Girl
Eddie Fisher,"Winter's coming on, I feel it all around
Leaves are moving faster along the ground
Why have all my dreams been broken wide apart
Where is all the hope that was in my heart

Another autumn, I've known the chill before 
But every autumn I feel it more and more
For you can dream in spring when every hope is high 
But when the fall comes in they all begin to fade and die

Another autumn so sleep when all is well
But how it haunts you when all is wrong
For one thing time has shown if you're alone
When autumn comes you'll be alone all winter long",Another Autumn
Eddie Fisher,"She's a babe
Just a babe
Still cavorting in her crib
Eating breakfast with a bib

With her baby teeth 
And all her baby curls
She's a tot
Just a tot

Good for bouncing on your knee
I am positive that she
Doesn't even know that boys aren't girls
She's a snip

Just a snip
Making dreadful baby noise
Having fun with all her toys
Just a chickadee who needs a mother hen

She's a cub, a papoose
You could never turn her loose
She's too infantile to take her from her pen
Of course, that weekend in Trouville

In spite of all her youthful zeal
She was exceedingly polite
And on the whole a sheer delight
And if it wasn't joy galore

At least not once was she a bore,
That I recall
No, not at all
Ah! She's a child

A silly child
Adolescent to her toes
And good heaven how it shows
Sticky thumbs are all the fingers she has got

She's a child
A clumsy child
She's as swollen as a grape
And she doesn't have a shape

Where her figure ought to be,
It is not!
Just a child
A growing child

That's so backward for her years
If a boy her age appears
I am certain he will never call again!
She's a scamp and a brat

Doesn't know where she is at
Unequipped and undesirable to men
Of course, I must confess
That in that brand new little dress

She looked surprisingly mature
And had a definite allure
It was a shock in fact to me
The most amazing shock to see

The way it clung
On one, so young!
She's a girl,
A little girl!

Getting older, it is true
Which is what they always do
Till that unexpected hour
When they blossom like a flower!

Oh no
Oh no
But, but,
There's sweeter music when she speaks

Isn't there?
Could I be wrong?
Could it be so?
Oh where, oh where

Did Gigi go?
Gigi! Am I a fool without a mind
Or have I merely been too blind to realise?
Oh Gigi! Why you've been growing up before my very eyes

Gigi! You're not at all
That funny, awkward little girl, I knew
Oh no! Over night there's been a breathless change in you

Oh Gigi! While you were trembling on the brink
Was I out yonder somewhere blinking at a star?
Oh Gigi! Have I been standing up too close 
Or back too far?

When did your sparkle turn to fire?
And your warmth become desire?
Oh what miracle has made you the way you are?
Gigi! 
Gigi!

Gigi!
Oh no! I was mad not to have seen the change in you
Oh Gigi!",Gigi
Eddie Fisher,"Happy talk
Keep talkin' happy talk

Talk about things you'd like to do.
You gotta have a dream
If you don't have a dream
How you gonna have a dream come true?

Lookin' like a lily on a lake;
Talk about a bird learnin' how to fly

Eddie Fisher,"I've grown accustomed to her face
She almost makes the day begin
I've grown accustomed to the tune she whistles night and noon
Her smiles, her frowns, her ups and downs
Are second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in
I was serenely independent and content before we met
Surely I could always be that way again and yet
I've grown accustomed to her looks, accustomed to her voice
Accustomed to her face

She's second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in
I'm very grateful she's a woman and so easy to forget
Rather like a habit one can always break and yet
I've grown accustomed to the trace of something in the air
Accustomed to her face",I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face
Eddie Fisher,"I was resting comfortably, face down in the gutter
Life was serene, I knew where I was at
""There's no hope for him,"" my dearest friends would mutter
I was something dragged in by the cat. Then

Just in time, I found you just in time
Before you came my time was running low
I was lost, the losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed, nowhere to go

Now you're here and now I know just where I'm going
No more doubt or fear, I found my way
For love came just in time, you found me just in time
And changed my lonely life that lovely day",Just in Time
Eddie Fisher,"The hills are alive
With the sound of music
With songs they have sung
For a thousand years

The hills fill my heart
With the sound of music
My heart wants to sing ev'ry song it hears

My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
That rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze

To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls
Over stones on its way
To sing through the night
Like a lark who is learning to prey

I go to the hills
When my heart is lonely
I know I will hear
What I've heard before

My heart will be blessed
With the sound of music
And I'll sing once more",The Sound of Music

My feet are on the ground

But I'm always hearing wedding bells
And wishing you were here
I never thought I'd fall
But when I saw you how quickly I fell
And darling that's not all
Your kiss rang a wedding bell
If I'm only dreaming
You'll make my dreams come true
On the day I'm hearing wedding bells
Walking down the aisle with you

I never thought I'd fall
But when I saw you how quickly I fell

Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing

You can always go

When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry
Seems to help, I know. 
Down town.
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city,
Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty.
How can you lose?

You can forget all your troubles,
Forget all your cares.
So go down town
Things'll be great when you're
Downtown.
No finer place for sure 
Down town,
Ev'rything's waiting for you. 
Downtown.

Don't hang around and let your problems surround you,
There are movie shows  
Downtown,
Maybe you know some little places to go to
Where they never close.

Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle Bossa Nova,
You'll be dancing with 'em too before the night is over.
Happy again.

The lights are much brighter there,
You can forget all your troubles,
Forget all your cares.
So go down town
Where all the lights are bright

Waiting for you, tonight 
Downtown,
You're gonna be all right now.

And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you.
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand

Forget all our cares.

Eddie Fisher,"Once upon a time a girl with moonlight in her eyes
Put her hand in mine and said she loved me so
But that was once upon a time very long ago

Once upon a hill we sat beneath a willow tree
Counting all the stars and waiting for the dawn
But that was once upon a time, now the tree is gone

How the breeze ruffled through her hair
How we always laughed as though tomorrow wasn't there
We were young and didn't have a care
Where did it go?

Everything was ours, how happy we were then
But somehow once upon a time never comes again

Once upon a time never comes again",Once upon a Time
Eddie Fisher,"People, people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world

We're children needing other children
And yet letting our grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children

Lovers are very special people
They're the luckiest people in the world

With one person, one very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half, now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people

People, people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world

No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people

People, people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world

Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow

Eddie Fisher,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

That summer kind of weather
When people get together and sing

It's the time of year
The stars seem to dance with laughter
And the moon's so big and ripe
It can hardly climb

So, why don't you meander
To your best gal's veranda
And sorta, kinda, hand her the ring?

For it's the sweetheart kissin' season
And all the world's in rhyme
When it's watermelon sweet love tellin' time

This is the time to sing this kind of purdy little ditty
A walkin' along an' singin' a song and clinging to someone purdy
The type of a tune to go with the moon
That's sailin' along a way on high

After strollin' a while, for maybe a mile
Remember to stop and pop the question
If your timin' is right, your future is bright
As bright as a watermelon sky

And then when you found a bench for two
You found your cue to linger
The chance you sought to show what you bought
You happily thought to bring her

To cinch the thing, you give her the ring
You purchased from the five and dime

Take her in your arms and whisper
That you are mine all mine
And with that line to sell, I'm here to tell
That you'll do well in watermelon time

For it's the sweetheart kissin' season
And all the world's in rhyme

Eddie Fisher,"With these hands, I will cling to you
I'm yours forever and a day
With these hands, I will bring to you
A tender love as warm as May

With this heart, I will sing to you
Long after stars have lost their glow
And with these hands, I'll provide for you
Should there be a stormy sea
I'll turn the tide for you
And I'll never
No, I'll never let you go

Eddie Fisher,"You start to light her cigarette
and all at once you love her
You've scarcely talked, you've scarcely met
But all at once you love her
You like her eyes, you tell her so
She thinks you're wise and clever
You kiss goodnight and then you know
You'll kiss goodnight forever
You wonder where your heart can go
Then all at once you know",All at Once You Love Her
Eddie Fisher,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine
Eddie Fisher,"Blue skies, smilin' at me
Nothin' but blues skies do I see

Bluebirds singin' a song
Nothin' but bluebirds all day long

All the days are hurryin' by
When you're in love, my how they fly
Blue days, all of them gone
Nothin' but blue skies from now on",Blue Skies
Eddie Fisher,"Get in touch with that sundown fellow
As he tiptoes across the sand
He's got a million kinds of stardust
Pick you fav'right brand, and

Dream, when you're feeling blue
Dream, that's the thing to do
Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air
You'll find your share of memories there

So dream when the day is through
Dream, and they might come true
Things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream, dream",Dream
Eddie Fisher,"Dozens of girls would storm up;
I had to lock my door,
Somehow I couldn't warm up
To one before.
What was it that controlled me?
What kept my love-life lean?
My intuition told me
You'd come on the scene.
Lady, listen to the rhythm of my heartbeat,
And you'll get just what I mean.

Embrace me,
My sweet embraceable you.
Embrace me,
You irreplaceable you.
Just one look at you, my heart grew tipsy in me.
You and you alone bring out the gypsy in me.
I love all
The many charms about you;
Above all,
I want my arms about you.
Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you.

Eddie Fisher,"So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears
Wish you were here",I Don't Care If the Sun Don't Shine/A Foggy Day
Eddie Fisher,"Dreary days are over
Life's a four-leaf clover
Sessions of depression are through
Every hope I longed for
Long ago comes true

Long ago and far away, I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast but now the clouds have passed
You're here at last

Chills run up and down my spine, Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Eddie Fisher,"Love and marriage, love and marriage,
Go together like a horse and carriage.
This I tell ya, brother, you can't have one without the other.

Love and marriage, love and marriage,
It's an institute you can't disparage.
Ask the local gentry and they will say it's elementary.

Try, try, try to separate them, it's an illusion.
Try, try, try and you only come to this conclusion:

Love and marriage, love and marriage,
Go together like a horse and carriage.
Dad was told by mother you can't have one
You can't have none.
You can't have one without the other.

Eddie Fisher,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Since my gal and I ain't together

Eddie Fisher,"The young gentleman came riding past
On a snow-blue winter's day
He asked to drink by our fire
And I was pleased to let him stay
He drank there quietly for a while
And then he turned and said to me

Your eyes are green like summer grass
Your lips are red like a fresh-cut rose
Your hair is soft like an Irish stream
And your voice is filled with sweet beauty
And the last words I heard him say were
I shall return, for you, my love, on Christmas Day

And the night will come, but I won't sleep
As I watch the stars that lead him
I cannot place where he is
But still my heart goes with him
I'm saving all my Sunday clothes
For the day that I'll be leaving

Father knows, my sister knows
And my friends, they're happy for me
And the priest he says, you should thank God
For the blessing of such beauty
And the last words I heard him say were
I shall return for you my love on Christmas Day

I shall return for you my love on Christmas Day

And the last words I heard him say
Were the last words I ever heard him say

I shall return for you my love on Christmas Day
I said I will return on Christmas Day
And yes, I shall return on Christmas day
I shall return, for you, on Christmas Day

Simply because you're near me.

So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.

I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night

But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin

You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed but you and now you've gone away

Eddie Fisher,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendour,
It brings back a memory evergreen.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavour,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine [A Tribute to Tony Martin]

Dangerous rhythm
It's something daring, The Continental,
A way of dancing that's really 'entre nous'.
It's very subtle, The Continental,
Because it does what you want it to do.
It has a passion, The Continental,
An invitation to moonlight and romance.
It's quite the fashion, The Continental,
Because you tell of your love while you dance.
Your lips whisper so tenderly.
Her eyes answer your song.
Two bodies swaying, The Continental,
And you are saying just what you're dreaming of.
So keep on dancing, The Continental,
For it's a song of romance and of love.
You kiss while you're dancing.

Not a bad idea.
The Continental, hmmmmm. It's continental.
You sing while you're dancing.
Your voice is gentle and sentimental.
You stroll together arm in arm.
You nonchalantly glide along with grace and charm.

That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul,
A certain rhythm that you can't control,
And you will do

And the beetle bugs are zooming
And the tulip trees are blooming
And there's not another human in view,
But us two

And the farmer leaves his reaping
In the meadow cows are sleeping
And the speckled trout stop leaping up stream
As we dream
A fat pink cloud hangs over the hill
Unfolding like a rose
If you hold my hand and sit real still,
You can hear the grass as it grows

And I know a place that's quiet, except for daisies running riot
And there's no one passing by it to see
Come spend this lazy afternoon with me",Lazy Afternoon [*]

Were searching for a different tune
One that they could croon
As only they can
They only had the rhythm
So they started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what to use
That is how the blues really began
They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that
As part of the blues
From a whippoorwill
Out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
Till it was worn
Into a blue note
And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the Southland gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues [DVD]

Eddie from Ohio,"Daddy oh daddy
Is that you behind the screen
I recognize some scratches
In this frame of olive green
Now this old door has always
Kept our family from harm
What would it take to unlock it
And find your outstretched arms

look at me it's your prodigal kid
But don't go and slaughter the calf
You've not seen the likes of me
For one year and a half
Somehow bad breaks and big mistakes
Have driven me to tears
My conscience aches I hope this makes
Some sense to your fresh ears

look by me it's my roadtrip friend
And by the way my spouse
Our occupation's travel
And our chevy is our house
We dig the dead and just got wed
In vegas back in may
We don't do much to keep in touch
That's why I must say

you can yell at me and laugh
We'd argue 'til the dawn
You can pull my photographs
And throw them on the lawn
Now you don't owe me
Mister and I'm sure not your exemption
But I'm a buck twenty-five from bein' broke
And a hail mary shy of redemption

look at me it's your second born
But don't go and slaughter the lamb
I just dropped by to say hello
And tell you how I am
Some southbound deals
And makeshift meals
Have led me to your door
Could you arrange a fair exchange
For sleep upon your floor

chorus

buck twenty-five
Is that you behind the screen
Hail mary shy
The paint's a peelin' on this olive green
Buck twenty-five
A door that's kept our family from sin
Hail mary shy
Come and let your child in

chours",Hail Mary Shy of Redemption
Eddie from Ohio,"If I were a flintstone
I'd make myself some shoes
I'd set up shop and sell bedrock
My shoes sensible shoes
A pioneer of footwear
Lordy-be and bless my soul
I'd be a bc billionaire
The first you'd ever know

so load your wheels
With t-bone steaks
Keep in mind you got no breaks
It's no small feat
To stop your car
So mind the stops
Wherever you are
That you don't
Wear out your shoes

if I were mayor of bedrock
I'd write a law on shoes
I'd make the town of bedrock
All wear shoes sensible shoes
The maker of air freds
Lordy-be and bless my soul
I'd retire a bc billionaire
The first you'd ever know

chorus

and if I were a jetson
I'd throw out all my shoes
I'd set up cans for friends
To dump their shoes senseless shoes
A pioneer of callouses,
Lordy-be and bless my soul
I'd be a barefoot spaceman
The first you'd ever know

chorus",If I Were a Flintstone
Eddie from Ohio,"She on the left he on the right
They sit in there living room
Stare at the fire, sparks up the flu
Escape to the night, bedtime soon

and sure there's plenty to talk about
But there ain't much to say
God's on the mantlepiece
And what's he got to do
With all of this anyway

and the silence here is written
It's the holiest you've ever seen
These two just bookends
To the spaces in between

they say they can talk about anything
Unlike so many others they know
Three out of five end in divorce
A matter of course, they read it was so
They read it was so

she closes the book he puts out the fire
She turns down the bed, coming dear
They lie in the dark, listening to
Whispering ghosts in the downstairs room

CHORUS

(she on the left, he on the right,

sparks up the flu, escape to the night)",Bookends
Eddie from Ohio,"First it happened slowly
Then quickly came
Unveiled as madness
Disguised as something sane
He never meant to
He wrapped her up in his life
She stuck to it like glue
Round and round they spin
Weaving in the night
Tapestry will envelope them
They'll fight the good fight

one heart cannot hold all of this
One man's grace is another man's hell
Two souls can melt together
'til one can no longer find itself

they kept up appearances
For family and friends
He coveted her soul
She put up no defense
We all began to notice
Unmistakable signs
They were never in the same room
At the very same time
And in the hiding of their bedroom
One hybrid voice was heard
Two would shed their clothing
One body would emerge

CHORUS

round and round they spin
Weaving in the night
Tapestry will envelope them
They'll fight the good fight

Eddie Gale,"Once I had a secret love,
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love,
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's

The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura

It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you

Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Eddie Harris,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Eddie Harris,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

Seeing you in summer I never would go.
Your hair streaked with sun-light, your lips red as flame, your face with a luster.
That puts gold to shame.

But if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn.
How I'd leave in autumn I never will know.
I've seen how you sparkle, when fall nips the air.
I know you in autumn, and I must be there.

And could I leave you running merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow

If ever I would leave you, how could it be in spring-time
Knowing how in spring I'm bewitched by you so
Oh, no! not in spring-time.
Summer, winter or fall.
No, never could I leave you at all.

Everybody falls in love somehow
Something in your kiss just told me
My sometime is now

Everybody finds somebody someplace
There's no telling where love may appear
Something in my heart keeps saying
My someplace is here

If I had it in my power
I'd arrange for every girl to have your charm
Then every minute, every hour
Every boy would find what I've found in your arms

Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dream was overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting

But I miss you most of all my darling

And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him

But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland

In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

Why can't I let you know,

That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love,
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep
While we sleep, sleep, sleep

Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary

Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Sweet to my ears is the song every bluebird sings,
Each rosebud kissed by the dew,

The sentimental breeze, the dreamy streams that flow,
Every country lane and every street of stone
Are highways of adventure made for me alone.

Over the shadows and the rain

With just one tear in my eye
I remember late one evening
My sweet baby said goodbye to me
Oh yes, she did

I cried so hard when she left me
I just rolled up in a great big ball
All my life drained from my body
'Cause that one tear
That one tear just wouldn't fall

How I tried to forget her
But this one tear won't set me free
I didn't know till she went away
Just how much that woman meant to me
Ooh yes, she did

Without her my life is nothing
Even though she let me down
If my baby don't come home to me
In this one tear
In this one tear I'm gonna drown

Every night I, I say a prayer
And I whisper something, Lord
I've got to get my baby back
So this one tear
So this one tear will let me go

You, my baby, stop my crying
I, I, I've been slowly dying
Want to feel me
Want to free me

Eddie Kendricks,"Childhood part of my life, it wasn't very pretty.
You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city,
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children besides me.
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep.
It was hard times,
Needed something to ease my troubled mind.
Listen!  my father didn't know the meaning of work,
He disrespected mama, and treated us like dirt.
I left home, seekin' a job that I never did find,
Depressed and downhearted I took to cloud nine,
I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Listen one more time I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Folks down there tell me,
They say, ""give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by"".
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive,
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.
Listen!  it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night,
I'm doin' fine, on cloud nine.
Let me tell you about cloud nine.

Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be
(cloud nine) you ain't got no responsibility,
And ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free
(cloud nine)  and you're a million miles from reality.
I wanna say I love the life I live,
And I'm gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine.
I'm riding high
On cloud nine, you're as free as a bird in flight
(cloud nine)  there's no diff'rence between day and night
(cloud nine)  it's a world of love and harmony
(cloud nine)  you're a million miles from reality.

Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be

And ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free

Eddie Kendricks,"Sunshine blue skies please go away
The girl has found another and gone away.
With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room.
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain,

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears,
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,
Let it rain, let it rain.

once again runnin' away with me.
It was just my imagination runnin' away with me. Oo
 
Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country with two children maybe three.
I tell you I can visualize it all 
this couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems;
But it was Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.
 
Ev'ry night on my knees I pray Dear Lord, Hear my plea;
Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.

Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.

Out of town were the people I knew

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

I'm leaving today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York
These vagabond shoes are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it
New York, New York
I wanna wake up in a city that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap
These little town blues are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it in old New York
If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York
New York, New York, New York
I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps
And find I'm a number one, top of the list
These little town blues are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it in old New York
If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York, New York","New York, New York"
Eddie Layton,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!
Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the stars",Stairway to the Stars
Eddie Layton,"I saw a blind man,
He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,
One could not see,
One could not walk,
But they both were humming this song;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.
 
I used to worry,
I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,

Eddie LeJeune,"I ain't got no claim to nothing,
I don't mess with anyone,
I walk my way
Living in a masquerade.

And one day I looked behind me
At all the things I've done,
That's the first mistake
I ever made.

I was born to a lonely woman
In a town called Buffalo.
Never knew the man
Who never stayed.

With my 12-string on my back
I discovered every track,
That's the first mistake
I ever made.

With a million hearts I've broken.
I never kept the score.
Memories of good love
Hate to stay.

But I still remember someone
Who loved me so much more,
That's the first mistake
I ever made.

So, when nothing's worth the living
And in the night I look above.
Prayed, about a million times
I prayed.

I know my story ended
When I lost my only love,
That's the first mistake
I ever made.

Aw not again
So you're packin' your bags
And you're leaving? But that ain't right
You need to stay awhile think about it
But wait a minute before you go
There's just one thing I want you to know

We both agree 
That this love ain't what it used to be 
We just grew apart
I got nothin' but love for you baby
Girl you'll always be my heart

You know I missed your face
I know you're gettin' ready to leave

I never thought you'd leave me baby

If you looked in the dictionary
Under the word wrong, you'd see me crying, crying
If you looked for someone with the broken heart

Come home asking for forgiveness, please

But I tell my soul to get you back

Girl, I'll do it if I have to

How can I make this dream come true for me?
Oh, I just got to know,
Oh, baby, 'cause I love you so,
Gonna blow for you

You're gonna brag 'bout the Bugle Call Rag.
Thin or fat, young or old;
Shake their shoulders bold.
You're bound to fall for the bugle call;
You're gonna brag 'bout the Bugle Call Rag.
Hold me baby; Let's syncopate to that blue melody;
Just hesitate while a break they take Shh!
While we're dancing please hold me tight; step lively don't lag.

Eddie Maynard,"Pardon me boy, is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo?
Track twenty nine, boy you can gimme a shine
I can afford to board a Chattanooga Choo Choo
I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare
 
You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina
 
When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin'
Woo, woo, Chattanooga, there you are
 
There's gonna be a certain party at the station
Satin and lace, I used to call funny face
She's gonna cry until I tell her that I'll never roam",Chattanooga Choo Choo

Eddie Miller,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confessin' that I need you,
Honest I do, need you every moment.
In your eyes I read such strange things,
But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,
Saying ""can't we still be friends""

Behind my back
Is it true you might want a better life
Is it true you think
These things are lies, now
Think about it baby
I'm gonna take you to the top

So baby hold on to me
Whatever will be, will be (I say)
The future is ours to see
When you hold on to me

Hey baby
You know the future's lookin' brighter
Every mornin' when I get up
Don't be thinkin' 'bout what's not enough, now baby
Just be thinkin' 'bout what we got
Think of all my love, now
I'm gonna give you all I got

So baby hold on to me
Whatever will be, will be
The future is ours to see
When you hold on to me

Oh-oh, rich man, poor man, now
Really don't mean all that much
Mama's always told you, girl
That money can't buy you love

So baby hold on to me
Whatever will be, will be
The future is ours to see
When you hold on to me

Yeah, eh
Baby hold on to me
Whatever will be, will be
The future is ours to see
When you hold on to me

Uh-huh! Hold on to me tighter

Never gonna let you go
So hold on to me tighter

Baby hold on to me

Eddie Money,"I was listening to the radio
I heard a song reminded me of long ago
Back then I thought that things were never gonna change
It used to be that I never had to feel the pain
I know that things will never be the same now

I want to go back
And do it all over again
But I can't go back I know
I want to go back
Cause I'm feeling so much older
But I can't go back I know

I recall hanging out on Friday night
The first slow dance
Hoping that I'll get it right
Back then I thought I'd never ever stand alone
It used to be that a lonely heart was never shown
I know that things will never be the same

I want to go back
And do it all over again
But I can't go back I know
I want to go back
Cause I'm feeling so much older
But I can't go back I know

Can't go back

I can't go back

I know now that things will never be the same

I want to go back

But I can't go back I know
I want to go back

I want to go back

I want to go back

In my dream I know that you still care.

Won't somebody show me the way?
Show me the way

Eddie Money,"Go swiftly
The flags and drums can hypnotize
When glory has faded the dream is worth more than the prize
A twisting, turning flame
Of freedom burning bright
Knows all of the names
And all of the games of the yellow, black and white
We gotta have faith
To work it out
Faith and hope
Without a doubt
Give us strength to make a start
Put a song in our hearts...

We're never gonna break down walls
And build a prison with the stone
'Cause you and I know what this is worth
We're gonna build heaven on earth
We're running in the wheels of fortune
Turning water into wine
We're gonna take love and make it shine
We're gonna find peace in our time...

Softly, softly
When there is lightning in the sky
When rivers are rising and trouble rolls in on the tide
We'll keep on keeping on
'Til all the tears are dry
We'll weather the storm and welcome the dawn
Of tomorrow you and I...

We've gotta have faith...(faith)
And get it fast
Faith and hope...(hope)
And let it last
Give us strength...(strength)
To reach the stars, put a song in our hearts.

At the sign...(sign) of the dove...(love)
Is gonna shine...(shine) shine (shine) shine
On a wing...(sing) and a prayer...(yeah)
We'll be fine...(fine) fine (fine) fine...

People! People!
Do you believe in what you see
Surrounded by fire and magic are you really free
It's heating! Heating up!
Along the avenue
We're raisin' the dust it's heaven or bust

We will see this dream come true
We're gonna have faith...(faith)
The road will be long
Now there's hope...(hope)
To carry us on
We'll have strength...(strength)

Hopin' that the wind and rain is clear

So many things have come between us
Gotta stand up and move around

I just wanna fall in love again
I don't want our dreams to ever end
I just wanna fall in love again
Ah, with you

I still love to go to the river
Ah, just to wash my blues away

A red dress, looking too serious
When she walsk into a room
Wearin' those high heels
Man, she makes me feel
Like a rocket that's off to the moon
She's about a mover
Hey, what can I say
She takes my breath away

Dancin' like the floor's on fire
And we're never touchin' the ground
Well, she lifts me a little bit higher
And I love when there's no comin' down
She be runnin' red hot, I can't put out the flame
She tears me up, like a hurricane
She's a roller-coaster, she's a tidal wave
She takes my breath away

Takes my breath (takes my breath)
Everytime she moves that way
All my words (all my words)
Hard to say (hard to say)
Well, she takes my breath away

Watch out, she's like dynamite
She could go off anytime
Fascination, stimulation, uh huh
Now she's got me so hypnotized
When she moves it
I can hardly say
She takes my breath away

Now what more can I say?
And I gotta have her, oh night and day

Well, she takes (well, she takes)
Takes my breath (takes my breath)
And I love the way she plays (come on baby play with me)
Every move (every move) that she makes (that she makes)
Well, she, she takes my breath away

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,

Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing

It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red

She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
