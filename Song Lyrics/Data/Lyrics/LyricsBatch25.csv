Codie Prevost,"I could drive this car till the wheels fell off
In the middle of nowhere
Hop a plane and fly till I got lost
And wonder how I got there
Catch a rocket ride up to the moon
And disappear into thin air
No matter where I run
I keep coming home

Like a sunrise waking up every city in the world
Like a song that's ringing true I wanna sing it for you
Like the gravity that pulls the tide and keeps it rolling in
I keep Rolling Back To You
I'm Rolling Back To You

I could loose my shirt in Timbuktu
Broken up and busted
Wander through this world without a clue
And never get adjusted
But if I lost my mind I'd still find you
'Cause I've always trusted
This perfect Chemistry
It's got a hold on me

If the rest of the rest of the world could feel the way we do
They'd all be singing too
Singin'",Rolling Back to You
Cody Black,"I heard church bells ringing,
I heard a choir singing.
I saw my love walk down the aisle.
On her finger, he placed a ring, oh, oh.

I saw them holding hands
She was standing there with my man.
I heard them promise 'til death do us part.
Each word was a pain in my heart.

Oh.  All I could do, all I could do was cry.
All I could do was cry.
I was losing the man that I loved,
and all I could do was cry.

And now the wedding is over,
rice has been thrown over their heads.
For them, life has just begun but mine is at an end

Oh.  All I could do, all I could do was cry.
All I could do was cry.
I was losing the man that I loved,
And all I could do was cry.",All I Could Do Was Cry
Cody Canada,"When I was a young man barely seventeen
I went on out to Hollywood chasing my dream
And dusty Oklahoma was all I'd ever seen
And I was getting older
Memories of the greyhound
Fade and quickly pass
Lonely restaurant windows
And the empty hourglass
Reflect the human hunger
Of the questions never asked
And I only had my time for spending

[Chorus]
I'm goin' on back to Tulsa just one more time
I'm goin' on back to Tulsa just one more time
I'm goin' on back to Tulsa just one more time
I've got home sweet Oklahoma on my mind

Now I'm growing younger
And how I just don't know
Life's a lot more happy
And it's movin' nice and slow
The past is just some photographs
Of the good friends that I know
And my love is so much better
Yes it is

[Chorus x3]

When I was a young man barely seventeen
I went on out to Hollywood chasing my dream
And dusty Oklahoma was all I'd ever seen
And I was getting older",Home Sweet Oklahoma
Cody Canada,"If you're ever in Oklahoma
You better move around at night
They don't like no transportation
Slippin' in and out of sight

[Chorus]
They don't care 'bout Dallas Texas
They don't care 'bout Wichita
If you're ever in Oklahoma
You better move around the law

They got fines and they got plenty
Hold you up for days on end
Threaten your life take your money
Make you think you're here to stay

[Chorus: x2]

If you're ever in Oklahoma
You better move around the law",If You're Ever in Oklahoma
Cody Canada,"The first time I thought about leavin'
Was the last time I made her cry
I talked myself out of believin'
That true true love never dies

First time I thought of returnin'
Was just ten lonesome miles out of town
My foolish pride kept these wheels a turnin'
And there was nothin' on this earth gonna shut me down

If I had one drop of water
For each and every tear I have cried
I'd sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow
True, true love never dies

The fire of angers turned to ashes
You know pride will forsake you by and by
The lonesomest night surely passes
And true, true love never dies

If I had one drop of water
For each and every tear I have cried
I'd sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow
True, true love never dies

If I had one drop of water
For each and every tear I have cried
I'd sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow
True, true love never dies
No it never dies

I'd sail back to her
On an ocean of sorrow
True, true love never dies
And it never will
No, no, no",True Love Never Dies
Cody Jinks,"Wish I were down, on some blue bayou
With a bamboo cane stuck in the sand
But the road I'm on, don't seem to go there
So I just dream, keep on being the way I am

Wish I enjoyed, what makes my living
And what I do, with a willing hand
Some would run, but that ain't like me
So, I just dream, keep on being the way I am

The way I am, don't fit my shackles
The way I am, reality
I can almost see, that bobber dancin'
So, I just dream, keep on being the way I am

The way I am, don't fit my shackles
The way I am, reality
I can almost see, that bobber dancin'

Cody Johnson,"Yeah that's my old girlfriend
Saw her when she walked in
Her hair's a little longer but she's still lookin' stronger than sin

No, I don't care if you buy her a drink
But she's not the kind of girl you think
Oh, cause back when we were lovin' she thought cowboys were something
Now' they ain't

Cause she's over buckles
She's over spurs
To her you're just a heartache in a pearl snap shirt
Been lassoed and let go for the last time
No, she ain't just over me, she's over me and my kind

I guess I ruined it for the rest of us
When I left her standing in my dust
Oh, and lately she's been hating rodeos and Copenhagen
And trucks, ha-ha

Yeah she's over buckles
She's over spurs
To her you're just a heartache in a pearl snap shirt
Been lassoed and let go for the last time
No she ain't just over me, she's over me and my kind

Yeah she's over buckles
She's over spurs
To her you're just a heartache in a Wrangler pearl snap shirt

She ain't just over me, she's over me and my kind",Me and My Kind
Cody Johnson,"I rode a horse named Whiskey, I thought I could trust
'Til she pinned her ears back and just like a whip crack 
She left me in the dust
I was cruisin' on my Harley, enjoyin' the breeze
I got hit head on and thrown, Lord knows it should've killed me

Every scar has a story, and it leaves its mark
Guess you could say I'm the king of takin' things way too far
I thought I knew pain, ain't nothin' I ain't been through
But when I met you, girl, I fell hard
Every scar has a story, just ask my heart

I remember that mornin', I saw your face
Turnin' down a side street, somethin' inside me said 
Don't let her get away
And those nights that followed, they still haunt me 
'Cause they were some of the best, I'll never forget how good it used to be

Every scar has a story, and it leaves its mark
Guess you could say I'm the king of takin' things way too far
I thought I knew pain, ain't nothin' I ain't been through

They say old wounds heal with time and they get better
But the hurts you left on me will last forever

Cody Johnson,"I'm a lone country mile from bein' style 
Dirty hat an cowboy boots
I cut my teeth on them old outlaw songs 
My daddy used to listen to
Guess it's in my genes
I gotta be me
Yeah I say what I think 
But sometimes I drink 
And when I do I drink too much
Wind up on my back 
Eye shinin' black 
And I know it's all because bad as it might be
Hey I gotta be me

You can wine me up an dine me 
You can polish up an shine me but the real things gonna shine through
It ain't always pretty but the cowboy in me 
Couldn't change if he wanted to

Yeah I had a girl her name was Pearl 
I think she's up in Arkansaw
She raised her voice and gave me a choice 
'Tween singin' in a Honkeytonk or JOB 
As u can see I gotta be me

Yeah you can wine me up an dine me 
You can polish up an shine me but the real things gonna shine through
It ain't always pretty but the cowboy in me 
Couldn't change if he wanted to

'Tween the Lexus and the Cootie Ville

Cody Johnson,"That's a pretty little sundress you got on
And them pink flip flops look brand new
Got your toenails painted up midnight red
Spring time tan on the back of your neck, girl look at you

This white v-neck that I got on
Is clean as a whistle, bright as a day
I got new spit shine on my old boots 
Starched these wranglers just for you, yesterday
We can stay right here and that'd be fine
Oh but I got somethin' else on my mind

We can get some grass stains
Roll around on the fresh cut ground 
We ain't gotta lay a blanket down, and I know a place
Right over the creek, and through the pines 
We can get a little green where the sun don't shine
In the middle of the day, girl what do you say
We get some grass stains

Come on baby now don't be shy
You're the prettiest thing that I've ever seen
But we can keep this midday rendezvous
Just between me and you, and the washing machine
If you know what I mean

We can get some grass stains
Roll around on the fresh cut ground 
We ain't gotta lay a blanket down, and I know a place
Right over the creek, and through the pines 
We can get a little green where the sun don't shine
In the middle of the day, girl what do you say

Cody Johnson,"The band was startin' slow and about the time you walked in 
I could see it in your eyes 
You were heart broke and needin' a friend 
The singer started singin' as I let you have my barstool 
And before that first chorus was through 

You were already smilin' 
I said no use in tryin'
Open up a tab, oh girl I'm gladly buyin'
Ain't it funny thinkin' you were thinkin' you be drinkin' alone 
Baby ain't it crazy what can happen in half a song 

The second verse started 
I asked you if you'd like to dance 
When you said no I figured well there goes my chance 
But the singer kept on singin' and before he hit that chorus again 
I felt you grab my hand
Then we bee-lined to the floor like we'd done this before
Holdin' onto you one, two, three four
Spinnin' and a gettin' in a rhythm, girl it didn't take long
Baby ain't it crazy what can happen in half a song 

That song ended, said we've only got one more 
Now we're half way through and we're still out here on the floor
Wonder what you're thinkin' cause I think I'd like to drive you home 
But I know that's probably never gonna happen
I'll just settle for your number on a napkin
Then again you never know what could happen in half a song 
Half a song",Half a Song
Cody Johnson,"I ain't going nowhere baby
Rest your worries somewhere else
High up on a shelf now baby
Next to all your other doubts
Things have been real crazy lately
But I ain't going nowhere baby
If you need to cry girl here's a shoulder
Sometimes I feel like crying too
Every day I'm getting older
But that don't change this thing I've got for you
You're the only thing that saves me
So I ain't going nowhere baby
The radio's full of them good love songs
Can't hold a candle to a love this strong
It goes on and on, keeps getting stronger
Yeah, every time you lie next to me
I still feel like I'm 17
Nothing turns me on, the way you turn me on
I ain't going nowhere baby
I cancelled all your plans today
We both need some healing baby
Yeah, take my hand and I'll lead the way
Let's lock the door and love like crazy

Cody Johnson,"I thought number one would surely be me
I thought I could be what I wanted to be 
I thought I could build on life's sinking sand 
But now I can't even walk without you holding my hand 

I thought I could do a lot on my own
I thought I could make it all day long
I thought of myself as a mighty big man 
But Lord I can't even walk without you holding my hand 

Oh Lord, I can't even walk without you holding my hand 
The mountains too high and the valleys too wide 
Down on my knees that's where I learned to stand 
Oh Lord, I can't even walk without you holding my hand 

I think I'll make Jesus my all and all
And if I'm in trouble on his name I'll call 
If I didn't trust him I'd be less of a man 
'Cause Lord I can't even walk without you holding my hand 

Oh Lord, I can't even walk without you holding my hand

Cody Johnson,"Some towns look better as you leave 'em 
And right now this ones lookin' fine
'Cause with every mile that rolls by I'm a little closer 
To that sweet little gal of mine 

She's right there past the high beams 
And I need her beside me 
Foot heavy on the gas 
No, she don't mind me 
Leavin' her behind me 
'Cause she knows I know my way back 

I know the porch light'll be burnin' when I get there 
'Cause I've been out here keepin' it on
But the brightest light that shines 
Is that sweet little thing of mine
Waitin' inside my front door 

That girl that's right there past them high beams 
And I need her beside me 
Foot heavy on the gas 
'Cause she don't mind me 
Leavin' her behind me 
'Cause she knows I know my way back 

She don't have to speak 'cause I've already heard 
How bad she's been missin' me too
Just one touch of her hand 
Reminds this man 
Why I do everything that I do 

It's all for that girl right past them high beams 
That I need beside me 
Foot heavy on the gas 
Now, she don't mind me 
Leavin' her behind me 
'Cause she knows I know my way back 

Back for them miles underneath them high beams 
Pretendeding she's beside me

Cody Johnson,"As I slide the key in the ignition of this ol' truck and fire it up
I'm struck hard by the heaviness of this situation
My eyes are fixed on the small silver half heart key chain you gave me
Dangling in the dashboard light
I read the word ""forever"" over and over again, I wanna cry

I turn off my radio as I turn off your county road
To pick you up just like I've done at least a thousand times 
The gravel underneath these tires, 
Half mile stretch of ol' barbed wire, Drops of rain fallin' from the sky seem to know my pain, 

Know that I'm about to, reach out to hold your hand in mine
Feel your love baby one more time,
Press against your lips and hold you tight, I know the next kiss is a kiss goodbye
I could put it off for another day act like everything's gonna be okay 
It's gonna break my heart to see you cry 
I know the next kiss is a kiss goodbye

See it's not that what I got to do is more important than you, 
It's just what I gotta do
And I know you don't understand, hell I don't understand myself

As I pull up to your house, I feel my head spinnin' around 
Just thinkin' about How everything is about to change 
Every step I take towards your door I'm a little less certain than the step before
Oh but I know, I know, I know what I gotta do 

I got to reach out and hold your hand in mine, feel your love baby one more time,
Press against your lips and hold you tight, I know the next kiss is a kiss goodbye 
I could put it off for another day, act like everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna break my heart to see you cry 
I know the next kiss is a kiss goodbye 

Reach out and hold your hand in mine, feel your love baby one more time

It's gonna break my heart to see you cry 
I know the next kiss is a kiss goodbye 
Goodbye",Kiss Goodbye
Cody Johnson,"Another day break wakes me up to a hotel lobby coffee cup
That dirty old white pickup truck with the trailer hooked up by the Denny's, she's mine
Last night's bugs on the windshield, fast food trash on the dash meal
Speedin' ticket and a doctor bill from a gash I got from a short go in Casper
Summer of last year, maybe next year

And a ride, and a fall, one day I might win 'em all
Just some broken hearts and broken bones, and a hell of a whole lot of bein' alone
But a right, and a wrong, where I hang my hat is home
This cowboy life might kill me, but it's the only one I know

Cell phone was breakin' up, the night she called to say she'd had enough
Of my little white lies and little white lines and wantin' somebody who could never be with her
I look back on every fork in the road that I took to chase that buckle of gold
And wonder if what I held for what I hold is worth tradin' away
Hell I don't know, all I know

Is a ride, and a fall, one day I might win 'em all
Just some broken hearts and broken bones, and a hell of a whole lot of bein' alone
But a right, and a wrong, where I hang my hat is home
This cowboy life might kill me, but it's the only one I know

Yeah it'll kill me, before it ever lets me go
It'll kill me, but it's the only life I know
And I'd rather die than be caught cryin'
So I'm just smilin', wear my hat down low
Wear my hat down low

And a ride, and a fall, one day I might win 'em all
Just some broken hearts and broken bones, and a hell of a whole lot of bein' alone
But a right, and a wrong, where I hang my hat is home
This cowboy life might kill me, but it's the only one I know
Yeah this cowboy life might kill me, but it's the only one I know",The Only One I Know (Cowboy Life)
Cody Johnson,"There's a difference, in the way she feels when I touch her now
I can tell that something's wrong but I can't put my finger on when, the why, or how
And there's a coldness in the way she swears I'm not the reason she's not in the mood
And it tears me up inside to lie here next to her while she lies to me about you

She thinks I don't know but I'm about to lose control
She's the kinda love that builds you up enough but she can't stand to be alone
Hell's what I'm gonna raise, 'cause I'm hell bent on a change
Buddy finish your drink its on me, then get up and walk away

You see I've known her long enough to know how she was before she was mine
And I'm not oblivious its just I've been the only one for all this time
So now you know the reason I came in here tonight to put an end to this romance
There's nothing you can say or do to prove to me that shes not worth a second chance 

She still thinks I don't know but I'm about to lose control
She's the kinda love that builds you up enough but she can't stand to be alone

Cody Johnson,"You're like waking in the morning by a mountain stream
You're like watching that eagle floating on the breeze
As I listen to you dreaming by my side
I wish I could call you mine

But you belong where the four winds blow
Out where the untamed mustang roam
Like a sweet summer rain, passing through
Never seen anything wild as you

I could stay with you like this
Till the day love don't exist
Wild flowers bloom in an open field
And wither in a vase on a window seal

But you belong where the four winds blow
Out where the untamed mustang roam
Like a sweet summer rain passing through
Never seen anything wild as you

There's a part of me that prays
That you'll hang up your wings someday
But the part that truly does love you
Always hopes you never do

'Cause you belong where your heart can be
Out in the open, wild, and free
Like a sweet summer rain, passing through
I ain't never seen anything wild as you

You belong where the four winds blow
Out where the untamed mustang roam

Cody Johnson,"I've never been a cold hand Luke

You made me dream and I?m not a dreamer
I?ve had my doubts now I?m a believer.
I?ve changed my ways because of you.
And Girl, that?s one thing I just don?t do.
Look what you?ve done I never needed anyone but I need you.

Cody McCarver,"She had trailer park charm, he carved her name in his arm
Then he slept with the waitress from the bar
Then she took a chain to his car
And broke the windows on the love they had, redneck love gone bad

He got all liquored up, tried to hot wire her truck
Next thing he knew, he was seeing stars
While her daddy knocked him all around the yard
Oh, what a night they had, redneck love gone bad

'Round and around the blue lights go
Everybody's smoking and watching the show but it's over now
There's twenty-three versions of this story
Some say her love just drove that boy insane
But to me it's plain, redneck love gone bad, oh, pick him redneck

A few months back, she ran away, with a truck driver named Jose
She's happy and he's so glad, redneck love gone bad

And I'd spend all my money on caviar and cocaine
And I would not remember how you broke my heart today

You know I, I wish I had a super model so skinny and so wild
And a waitress in Nevada, she says she's carrying my child
Well I'd drive down Sunset Boulevard, my hair blowin' in the wind

Cody McCarver,"He got a wrinkled up rock 'n' roll T-shirt on and a beanbag for a couch 
He can hold his beer but he can't hold a job and he creeps your little sister out 
When he flexes his muscle and he makes that Hooters girl on his right arm dance 
Well he wants to be a star play air guitar someday in a heavy metal band

That's a good fit somethin' ain't right

You say this one's different cause he bought you flowers, a dozen fr'every day of the week 
He drives by your house every hour on the hour and writes you poetry 
It's all about destiny, how it's meant to be, how it's written in the stars that shine 
And he's talkin' love and kids and stuff, and you've only been out one time

She was shaped like a bottle
Long straight hair
She was fly as a bird
First time ever
I was lost for words

Just couldn't be wrong
Love at first sight
If that exists at all
I couldn't move
Felt like I was stuck

Whatcha doing later tonight?
Would you mind if I spend time with you?

She knows she's got it
Came from the city so she loves to party

She's dancing all night long

That's why I was shy at first

I think of you on that shoreline
Brushing the hair from your eyes
We were drawing our names on the wet sand
And running away as the tide rolled in

I promise that I won't give up on you
They say outta sight means outta mind
But that couldn't be further from the truth
'Cause I'm in love with you
I'm still in love with you

Even if there is an ocean
Keeping your heart from mine
That doesn't mean I'm not thinking
About you all the time

Told me to date all of the things that made you end up in my life
And I'll believe anything I have no luck with girls

But you had your back turned there as you faded away
At the end of my day I found out
You weren't worth what I thought of you
What I thought of you

Write this down in your diary you abuse
Can we make plans can I just get through to you
Is this weird, do I scare her?
I'll wish on this, I'll wish with this
I, I'll wish, that you could share the love you'd shared with others, with me

carving her name across your arm with every wish. It's hit or miss... her.

Weight, kind, depression
Blessing the floors with the places you've stepped in

Will they ever measure up
To the way you left?
Here on the roadside
The bloodiest cadaver
Marked in your words:
I'm the joke,
I'm the bastard

Here wait, so I guess that you knew
That you're a selfish little whore
I'm the selfish little whore
If I had my way I'd crush your face in the door

Couldn't know that I had no goodbyes
Oh but I wish that you were

The way that you would have been if I
Stayed here at home
I'm givin' it up Newo
How important I would have been to you

Press the steps I take to cross your door frame
You decide to answer when my fist swings hello

I severed my ties
To shroud this body under the streets of this city
And wait for the day
When I am summoned to walk across the face
Well, slowly but clearer now,
In visiouns that play and plague memories
I loved them with all
All as the son should to mother and father

But you, you were my favorite
But you, you know, you were my favorite

And I walk through the door,
Shaping the light of all life
With our eyes and reform,
Would I com as before
Pray you're not the only one
Pray you're not the only
If I form mistakes, would I take them back
If erasing them could, if erasing them would
But would they be the words that I would say
Your face and a door between
I've parted three ways
For you, the Newo that I love

Did you ever really know before
my face shamed too late?
Did you ever really know before
my mind scare to think?
Did you ever really know before
my name sung to these?
Did you, did you,
did you come clean in the end from the son?

Dear Ambelina,
The prizes she's due to watch over me
Dear Ambelina,
The prizes she saw to watch over me
I fought the decisions that called them lost
My mark in the revalant peace in this
I will come reformed
In short, for the murders of those I caught
I bless the hour that holds your fall
I will kill you all
I will call you (I will cross you out)
I found shells to
Burn your wings (burn your wings),
And burn the core
And burn the letters",The Crowing [DVD]

Until you decide to wake up.

Do you really think he's coming back to you?

Is there another, Newo?
Is there cushion just enough to break the fall

Enough to cry those sorry eyes out over the world

But now, along these empty streets
Where this curse holds these memories of a man
You know he's lost

No time to think about it
No room to breathe

If I had a way back, I'd ride through the dark and the door
(But please don't wait for me)
Because the man you love don't live anymore
I can't go home again

Tonight you'll sleep
You'll feel what might become of me, my dear
Within these end old days where this longing turns
This man to pray and a love begins to die

No time to live in the deep, girl
I'm worth the second chance
(What have I done?)
No time to think about it
No room to breathe

If I had a way back, I'd ride through the dark and the door
(But please don't wait)
Because the man you love don't live anymore
I can't go home again

I believed in the world, once in front of me
Well, now that's gone

If I had the way back, I'd ride through the dark and the door
(But please don't wait for me)
Because the man you love don't live anymore
I can't go home again

So there's no need for you to catch feelings for me
What will it take for you to give up?
How could you possibly love so much?
But there can't be anything between you and me

[Chorus]
There never was a time when I loved you
There never was a chance that I gave you
So how could you be loving me when I never loved you?
Why can't you just leave me alone?
Don't try and break up my happy home
What must I do for you to see
That there's no you and me?

One year has gone by
So why do you keep on calling me?
I told you the last time
That me and you could never be
Time has gone by
And still you try
To get with me
No questions why
Don't try to find
A place with me

And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Altho' it's been said many times many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the Soul felt its worth
(A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices)

Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices

O night divine, O night when Christ was born
O night divine, O night, O night divine

Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices

For the slave is our brother
And in His name
All oppression shall cease
With hymns of joy

So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

This fighting is feeding the flames
So lets try to slow it down

Oh this is not the way that it should end

But it's not too late to take them back
So, before you say you're gonna go
I should probably let you know
That I never knew what I had
I never knew what I had

See I look for you in the morning
'Cause that's where my mind always goes
And I can't wait to get to the evening
'Cause that's when I want you the most

I'm breaking at the cracks
And everything goes black

I know that I'll get through this 
I'm feeling is stronger somehow

Stuck here somehow
I'm shrouded beneath my fear and doubt
And I don't need it

Cause I'm walkin' down this road alone
And figured all I'm thinking 'bout is you, is you my love
My head is in a cloud of rain and the world it seems so far away
And I'm just waiting for the droplets, droplets

You left a mark
I wear it proudly on my chest
Above my heart
To remind me that I feel the best
When I'm with you
Everything is effortless
You know it's true
My eyes are painted with regret and I don't need it

Cause I'm walkin' down this road alone
And figured all I'm thinking 'bout is you, is you my love

Don't you know you end up hurting me

See the way that she breaks you so

To take control and be set free
Make some space so we can grow
Say you left
Before I let you go

So you say this will get better
Better for you, her or me?
Well I don't know what to tell ya
It's not my fault that I don't believe
'Cause you're still so stuck in that life
And I refuse to stay on this ride

When you ever going to let her go
See the way that she breaks you so
All I'm asking is for you please
Take control and be set free
Make some space so we can grow
Say you left

For you to change this

To take controls and be set free
Make some space so we can grow
Say you left
Before I let you go

I see your head spin right around
She make you fall and hit the ground
When you ever going to let her go
I see the way that she breaks you so

I swear you hit me like a vision
I, I, I wasn't expecting
But who am I to tell fate where it's supposed to go with it?
Don't you blink you might miss it
See we got a right to just love it or leave it
You find it and keep it
'Cause it ain't every day you get the chance to say

Oh, this is how it starts, lightning  strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, we could be the stars, falling from the sky
Shining how we want, brighter than the sun

I never seen it, but I found this love I'm undefeated
You better believe, I'm gonna treat? better than anything I've ever had
'Cause you're so damn beautiful read it
It's time and deliver it let's seal it
Boy we go together like peanuts and paydays and Marley and reggae
And it ain't every day you get the chance to say

Oh, this is how it starts, lightning  strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, we could be the stars, falling from the sky
Shining how we want, brighter than the sun

Everything is like a white out, 'cause we shk shk shine down
Even when when the light's out but I can see you glow
Got my head up in the rafters, got me happy ever after
Never felt this way before, ain't felt this way before

I swear you hit me like a vision
I, I, I wasn't expecting
But who am I to tell fate where it's supposed to go?

Oh, this is how it starts, lightning  strikes the heart

No matter how they dub us
We should stay true to the trust
And the winner of the best duo is us

Colbie Caillat,"I remember like yesterday
I carried a heart without hope
I'd given up on mystery
I only saw mirrors and smoke
Thought I was fine alone
It's just because I didn't know

I remember like yesterday
Loving you seemed far away
We were friends in different places
Then love began leaving traces
Sitting with you on a crowded bus
Seemed like just the two of us
That night everything was changed
I remember like yesterday

I was living in black and white,
A careful and colorless life
You are like a neon light
Shining through my closed eyes
All the ""right ones"" they turned out wrong
But you were here all along

I remember like yesterday
Loving you seemed far away
We were friends in different places
Then love began leaving traces
Little folded up love letters
Sweet songs written for each other
Everything was about to change
I remember like yesterday

You came just in time for me
Changed my mind so easily
Now it's you and me

I remember like yesterday
Loving you seemed far away
We were friends in different places
Then love began leaving traces
For the first time I love you
On a Paris afternoon
And now everything has changed
I remember like yesterday

I remember like yesterday
Loving you seemed far away
Thought I could live without you
So glad I finally found you
On the street in the pouring rain
Our lives both found their wings
I love how everything changed
I remember cause it's today

I'm tired of the angry hanging out inside me
So I'll quiet down the devil
I'm gonna knock him with a shovel
And I'll bury all my trouble underneath the rubble
When I'm alone in a dark, dark room I have to tell myself to

Think good thoughts, think good thoughts
Imagine what the world would be if we would, we would just
Think good thoughts, stop the bad from feeding
Oh won't let the negativity turn me into my enemy

Oh oh but I'm not gonna let them take away my heaven

Stars filling up the sky
The sun shining on my face
Making a secret wish
Finding my happiness
That always makes me hold my head up high

I gotta go
(You haven't even finish this drink)

I really can't stay
(But baby it's cold outside)
I've got to go away
(Baby it's cold outside)
This evening has been
(Been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice
(I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)

My mother will start to worry
(Beautiful, what's your hurry)
My father will be pacing the floor
(Listen to the fireplace roar)
So really I'd better scurry
(Beautiful, please don't hurry)
Well maybe just a half a drink more
(Put some records on while I pour)

The neighbors might think
(Baby, it's bad out there)
Say, what's in this drink?
(No cabs to be had out there)
I wish I knew how
(Your eyes are like starlight)
To break the spell
(I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)

I ought to say no, no, no, sir
(Mind if I move in closer)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
(What's the sense in hurting my pride)
I really can't stay
(Baby don't hold out)
Oh, but it's cold outside, oh, oh, oh
(Come on, give me chance)

I simply must go
(Baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no
(Oh darling, it's cold outside)
This welcome has been
(How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm

My brother will be there at the door

Say, will you lend me your coat
(It's up to your knees out there)
You know you've really been grand
(I'm thrilled when you touch my hand)
But don't you see
(How can you do this thing to me)

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
(Think of my life long sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied
(If you caught pneumonia and died)
I really can't stay
(Get over that hold out)
Oh, but it's cold outside

(You better get back over here)
Now, you don't give up, do you?
I gotta go home
(Then why you go home then, it's fine)
Fine, I'm leaving
(Good, kill the environment and burn this wish)

Oh oh I ought to say no, no, no sir

Colbie Caillat,"I love Christmas in the snow
But Christmas in the sand don't end
I tell you that's where it's at

Hawaiian Tropic on my skin
A candy cane of peppermint, a hint
Of cocoa on my lips

It could've been the sun
It could've been the sea
It could've been my childhood fantasy

I saw Santa in his bathing suit
Tried to catch a wave, but he tried to soon
He laughed so hard that he could barely breathe
And washed up next to me

He said that you look naughty
But I'm sure you're nice
He was soaking wet but he cracked a smile
With a present in his hand
He said it's Christmas in the sand

I must have had too much to drink
'Cause Rudolph's nose was shining green, I think
He was playing reindeer games on me
Santa only called him once
But you should've seen him run so fast
They were gone in a dash

It could've been the sun
It could've been the sea
It could've been my childhood fantasy

I saw Santa in his bathing suit
Tried to catch a wave, but he tried to soon
He laughed so hard that he could barely breathe
And washed up next to me

He said that you look naughty
But I'm sure you're nice
He was soaking wet but he cracked a smile
With a present in his hand
He said it's Christmas in the sand

Christmas in the sand, whoa
Christmas in the sand, whoa
Christmas in the sand, whoa
Christmas in the sand, whoa

Don't need your winter coat
Don't need your winter hat
Just grab the one you love
And say you're never coming back

If you see Santa in his bathing suit
Tried to catch a wave, but he tried to soon
He laughed so hard that he could barely breathe
It's what he did to me

He said that you look naughty
But I'm sure you're nice
He was soaking wet but he cracked a smile
With a present in his hand
He said it's Christmas in the sand

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety two

Since the moment we first met

And I don't need the snow to fall
And I don't need the lights to shine
And I don't need the mistletoe

For our hearts to race inside
And I still get just as excited

Every day is Christmas as long as
Every day you are mine

Hiding from the cold is always warmer in your arms

for everything they always wanted
And a beautiful, shiny winter wonderland

For my friends and my family

Maybe we worry too much about wishing
And not enough about giving

And be grateful that we're safe and warm
That our house is filled with songs and laughter
We gather by the fire making s'mores

It's caring and sharing
All of the good things
Not taking anything for granted
That we have

We'd go run outside and play
Easy snow, snow fight, snowman
Skating on the ice holding grandpa's hand

Can we stay whole together, please?

Colbie Caillat,"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, are you married
We'll say, no man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kids go knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Frolicking wherever the sun goes

When I get money I spend it on the bills but my baby shes the exception
To the rules you might wanna call it obsession but this to my heart

No one but you seems to get me they try to sweat me saying baby make
Me cum bed me even if they sexy it don't matter cause my heart won't

Pray for rain, all the time 
Why'd you run? Did you hide 
Why'd you leave, no good bye 
When the clouds, take the sky 
Does a soul, give you life? 

And every time it rains 
I feel her holding me

And every time it rains 
I feel her holding me 
And everytime it rains

I made you take it slow

I don't cry how you cry
There's nothing left to me

I have loved you
From the steeple to the streets of Rome
And I know, Ah yes I know, what's goin' down
They will come
When it's early
And breathe to me your last goodbye
And our long, long love is finally drowned

Teenage dreams
Satin tresses
Lie deserted all along the strand
And the ferryman has poled his way off home
Angels screamed
In those evenings
When I promised you my dying days
And my heart hatched its reasons to run

And Ah
These latter days
I'm fed on distant rumors
But third-hand news is news enough
For hopeless dream consumers

Quite at ease
In an armchair
Steaming coffee standing on my knee
I can still hear you whispering when the fire sighs
Rosaline
How I have loved you
With a careless kind of vanity
As they turned you around
And split us apart
And like a fool
I ran from the start
And in the end they told much smoother lies",Rosaline
Cold Chisel,"Hiked up to Sydney in the week before Christmas
It was thirty-eight degrees in the shade
I bought a second-hand Morris for a cheap two-twenty
And drove it down to Adelaide
She boiled for an hour twenty miles out of Euston
I thought that heat would never end
But I knew I'd be home for Christmas with my Sandy
And a few extra dollars to spend

[Chorus:]
Home and broken hearted
I've been pasted to the telephone
Boxing Day break was wasted sitting home on my own
The beer we bought for Christmas ran dry this afternoon
And on the radio it's New Year's Eve
What a low down time of the year to pack your luggage and leave

I drove it to the buyer just as fast as I could go
I was talking to his teenage son
I sure hope it lasted for the poor little bastard
At least until he'd had some fun
I caught a taxi homeward with great anticipation
Thinkin' all you have to do is try
There was a note propped up against the dressing table mirror
""Dear Jimmy, it's over, goodbye!""

[Chorus:]

Went to a party, tried to drink myself happy
The steaks were washed away in the rain
Finished up in bed with an old acquaintance
She'll never be my friend again
And everyone was asking me where's the little woman
Rolled home before the rain could stop
I've been sitting for days reading pre-Christmas papers
With my heels on the table-top

[Chorus:]",Home and Broken Hearted
Cold Chisel,"I cried my tears in a glass of tequila
For a truck-stop honey with a dubious name
She held my heart like a blackjack dealer
And she took my money when I left the game
She was overly fond of sophisticated messing around
I've had a bellyful of living on the same old merry-go-round

Well I played in the Summer and I froze in the Winter
And I hankered for the high school beauty queen
She was married to a rich young timber-miller
And Christened a boy when she was just nineteen
Crazy love, never gonna settle down
I've had a bellyful of loving on the same old merry-go-round

Like any man I've got to work for a living
Just to earn my soul for the weekend show
Saturday morning I'll be down by the river
Getting whipped at the Copmanhurst rodeo
When the weekend comes I'm gonna set fire to the town
I've had a bellyful of working on the same old merry-go-round

I'm gonna set fire to the town...
I'm gonna set fire to the town

I'm looking out as the sun goes down
Drinking Bundaburg at the end of the day
I'm twenty-five and only half alive
And the rest is only just a ticket away
Give me a ticket, take me to a city hotel
I've had a bellyful of living on the same old merry-go-round
I've had a bellyful of living on the same old merry-go-round

Cold Chisel,"City life is closing in on me
The way things go, thirty years,
Bus timetable'll be my elergy

Up at seven every working day
Pay comes in, pay goes out
It's a week-by-week charade

General panic in the marketplace
Boss found hung in office
Could not stand the pace

And as the peak-hour traffic jams below
Someone gets the story, somebody spread the rumour
People come and go

Wandered down along the river last night
Call me romantic, I say I couldn't sleep
Until the first-light struck me down

Padding homeward on the inside lane
Early morning, freeway's cool and quiet
Dodging rubber stains

People talking in a seaside bar
I ain't sentimental, but Lord
Sometimes I get that gypsy urge to travel far

You know I'll disappear some long weekend
Find a mangrove landscape
Stretch out along some busted jetty
And forget who I am

You go to move
You got to go
You go to be somebody
You got to roll
You got to stop
You got to change
You got to make a little money
And be a little strange

And one long day
Is all it takes to steal her heart away
One long night
And it's allright, you've done it again
Soft, low words
And slender ladies, beneath the cafe fans
One long day
laid by dreams
Cotton dresses, a Spanish border town
Dreams so far
From the subway, the crowds heading home
Close each day
In technicolor, a million miles away
One long night and you're alone

Meanwhile
City ways
Life goes creeping on
Sometimes
I get the blues",One Long Day

I'm just savoring familiar sights
We share some history, this town and I
And I can't stop that long forgotten feeling of her
Try to book a room to stay tonight

Number one is to find some friends to say ""You're doing well
After all this time you boys look just the same
Number two is the happy hour at one of two hotels
Settle in to play ""Do you remember so and so?
Number three is never say her name

And there's nothing else could set fire to this town
There's no change, there's no pace
Everything within its place
Just makes it harder to believe that she won't be around

But Ah! Who needs that sentimental bullshit, anyway
Takes more than just a memory to make me cry
I'm happy just to sit here round a table with old friends
And see which one of us can tell the biggest lies

There's a girl falling in love near where the pianola stands
With her young local factory auto worker, holding hands
And I'm wondering if he'll go or if he'll stay

Do you remember, nothing stopped us on the field
In our day

""If Nat King Cole
Can save his sole
He'll find his peace""

""If I was asked
Just who's to blame
To read his past
I'd have to say

And their legs were often open
But their minds were always closed
And their hearts were held in fast suburban chains
And the legal pads were yellow, hours long, pay packet lean
And the telex writers clattered where the gunships once had been
But the car parks made me jumpy
And I never stopped the dreams
Or the growing need for speed and Novocaine

Tried to find a place to settle down, where my mixed up life could mend
Held a job on an oil-rig

Coldcut,"I think you're a sucker if you stand there
In the midst of all this political fanfare
We're constantly fightin' to keep our rights, and
The more we press on, the more they tighten
Their grip, but I'm a soldier keepin' me from any rupture
Don't listen to the negative, it will only self-destruct ya

What happened to 'a government for the people, by the people'
What people? We ain't equal
Discriminated against for race, religion, education
And you call this a nation?
I'm here to tell ya, hey, there ain't a day
(That what?) we should continue goin' on this way
Who will be responsible for teachin' the youth the truth
Who's accountable for establishin' world peace?
Catch the thugs, get rid of the drugs
Cure the poor, when will the bullshit cease?
Think of what you want to say, no doubt
No one'll ever know you're stupid till you open your mouth
I'm callin' your bluff, it's time for a decision

Guarded by the Flavor Unit, no one can dethrone me
Latifah, the feminine professor of wits

And it ticks us off when we see so much wrong
(What's wrong) World, what's goin' on?
That's a question for you to ask yourself
Or are you that caught up in your wealth?
Kids are growin' up with materialistic minds
They become cruel and unkind
Spendin' all your money on Nikes and Filas
But when you see a panhandler, it's ""Ha-ha-ha
What a bum, get a job,"" I should hit you
With another verse of lyrics that'll fitcha
The words are cunning, stunning enough to pierce
But if you want to get fierce (do what?) smoke this one

Hopefully making, starring Uma Thurman, hopefully making,

Well, I know him actually and he's alright, going solo and
Good for a line every night.

Now would be a good place to die.
Out of my face, in the place with the name like that place, on the
Front page tomorrow, my face, headline reading mystery death
In new place.

For she was best top lover girlfriend of that guy with the chart
Topping hits, that actress, that director and that model with the
Fabulous tits. Then everyone will want to go to that place, because

To the ground comes a bit of a tumbling

Sometimes I just want it to slow down
And we're separated now
I'm down
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

And I spent the night with the Queen of Spain
My lonely little heart would've broke again
Times were vicious

You win but with less than when you begin
Deeper that the knife goes in

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Lovers in Japan/Reign of Love

I struggle with the feeling
That my life isn't mine

To tear us apart took the fire from my belly and
The beat from my heart

And it hurts like heaven

No, we won't let 'em take control

Yes, I feel a little bit nervous
Yes, I feel nervous and I cannot relax
I'm coming 'round to get us
I'm coming 'round when they don't know the facts

So on a concrete canvas and a glow in the dark
On a concrete canvas, I will make you a mark
Armed with the spray can soul
Let me out with the spray can soul

And she can't wait to see his face light up

She's going out to buy some eggs
While she slides her legs
Into her jeans with the ripped up knees

That she will look a little better
If her hair was long
Just a touch of make up on

When she smiles at you, says, ""Be back soon""
You don't know she's going
Just to hear the sack boy say, ""Hey, here she comes""

Well, I fell hard and I fell fast
If it wasn't for me it would've last
But the fool in me broke her heart
She tore out of town leaving all these parts
To Alabama

Hey, what I gotta do to get heart back on the highway?
Coming my way soon
Hey, what I gotta say to talk her into my arms
Back to Texas, Arkansas, out of Alabama

Yeah, nothing against the crimson tide
I just need that girl here by my side
And I know if I get my way
Alabama's gonna be crying that day

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey, what I gotta do to get heart back on the highway?
Coming my way soon
Hey, what I gotta say to talk her into my arms
Back to Texas, Arkansas, out of Alabama

I just can't seem to let her go
I gotta get her off of that Gulf Coast
She should be with the one that loves her most

Hey, what I gotta do to get heart back on the highway?
Coming my way soon
Hey, what I gotta say to talk her into my arms
Back to Texas, Arkansas, out of Alabama
Out of Alabama

I dream of her behind the wheel
Saying goodbye

Can you ask yourself again and again?

Cole Porter,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine

Dream dancing, dream dancing with you

When day is gone and night comes on
Until the dawn what do I do?
I clasp your hand and wander through slumber land
Dream dancing with you

We dance between a sky serene
And fields of green sparkling with dew
It's joy sublime whenever I spend my time
Dream dancing with you

Oh, what a lucky windfall
Holding you, clutching you
All the night through

Cole Porter,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You [From Broadway Melody of 1940]

That this longing for you, follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom

In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you night and day

Till you let me spend my life making love to you

Be a clown, be a clown

Why be a major poet and you'll owe it for years
When crowds'll pay to giggle if you wiggle your ears

Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
If you just make 'em roar
Watch your Mounte bank account soar

Wear a painted mustache

A bachelor's degree won't even keep you in clothes
But millions you will win if you can spin on your nose

The one I've most adored
Is bored 
With me.
Manhattan, I'm awfully nice,
Nice people dine with me,
And even twice.
Yet the only one in the world I'm mad about
Talks of somebody else
And walks out.

With a million neon rainbows burning below me
And a million blazing taxis raising a roar
Here I sit, above the town
In my pet pailletted gown
Down in the depths on the ninetieth floor.
While the crowds at El Morocco punish the parquet
And at '21' the couples clamor for more**
I'm deserted and depressed
In my regal eagle nest
Down in the depths on the ninetieth floor.
When the only one you wanted wants another
What's the use of swank and cash in the bank galore?
Why, even the janitor's wife
Has a perfectly good love life
And here am I
Facing tomorrow
Alone with my sorrow
Down in the depths on the ninetieth floor.",Down in the Depths
Cole Porter,"Now, before this modern idea had burst
About the women and children first,
The men had much more charm than they have today.
And if only one of that type survived,
The very moment that he arrived,
I know I'd fall in love in a great big way.
I can't imagine being bad
With any Arrow collar ad,
Nor could I take the slightest joy
In waking up a college boy.
I've no desire to be alone
With Rudy Vallee's megaphone,
So when I'm saying my prayers, I say:

Find me a primitive man,
Built on a primitive plan.
Someone with vigor and vim.
I don't mean a kind that belongs to a club,
But the kind that has a club that belongs to him.
I could be the personal slave
Of someone just out of a cave.
The only man who'll ever win me
Has gotta wake up the gypsy in me,
Find me a primitive man,
Find me a primitive man.

Trouve moi un homme primitif
Trouve moi un garcon naif.
Quelqu'un tout plein de vigeur,
Ces p'tits maquereaux qu'on appelle gigolos ne
Pourraient jamais donner le vrai bonheur.
J'ai besoin d'un bel animal
Pour chauffeur mon chaffage centrale.
Et l'homme qui me veut pour capitane
Devrait reveiler mon sang tzigane,
Trouve moi un homme primitif, vif,
Trouve moi un homme primitif.

(Find me a primitive man,
Find me a forthright young lad,
Someone with vigor to spare,
Those fatuous beaux they call gigolos could never give me happiness.

To heat up my own central heat.
And he who aspires to be my stud
Must reawake my gypsy blood.

Cole Porter,"Once I loved such a shattering physician,
Quite the best looking doctor in the state,
He looked after my physical condition
And his bedside manner was great!

When I'd gaze up and see him there above me,
Looking less like a doctor than a Turk,
I was tempted to whisper, ""Do you love me,
Or do you merely love your work?""

He said my bronchial tubes were entrancing,
My epiglottis filled him with glee,
He simply loved my larynx
And went wild about my pharynx,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my epidermis was darling
And found my blood as blue as can be,
He went through wild ecstatics
About my lymphatics,
But he never said he loved me.

And though, no doubt, it was not very smart of me,
I get on a-wracking of my soul,
to figure out why he loved every part of me,
And yet not me as a whole.

By my esophagus he was ravished,
Enthusiastic to a degree,
He said 'twas just enormous,
My appendix vermiformis,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my cerebellum was brilliant,
And my cererum far from N G,
I know he thought a lotta
My medulla oblogota,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my maxillaries were marvels,
And found my sternum stunning to see,
He did a double hurdle
When I shook my pelvic girdle,
But he never said he loved me.

He seemed amused,
When he first made a test of me
To further his medical art;
Yet he refused,
When he's fixed up the rest of me,
To cure that ache in my heart.

I know he thought my pancreas perfect,
And for my spleen was keen as can be,
He said, of all his sweeties,
I'd the sweetest diabetes,
But he never said he loved me.",The Physician [From Nymph Errant]
Cole Porter,"Oh, I'm so mad about a lad
It's too deep to express
And when he tries to use his eyes
They have instant success
So full of passion, these pupils are
That girls forget what their scruples are
So when he turns them on me
I murmur tenderly

I think you're great, I think you're grand
And I don't mind if you hold my hand
But don't look at me that way

Your kisses, too, are heavenly
And oh, so full of variety
But don't look at me that way

When you tell me sweetly you're mine completely
I always give a long cheer
But those sudden flashes behind your lashes
Are nobody's business, dear

Since you began to play your role
I've lost my heart and I've lost my soul
But as for losing my self-control
Don't look at me that way

I just adore your loving arms
In fact, they're two of your greatest charms
But don't look at me that way

I'm very mild, I'm very meek
My will is strong, but my won't is weak
So don't look at me that way

When that strange expression of indiscretion
Begins to show in your stare
There's a hocus-pocus about your focus
That gives me a terrible scare

Cole Porter,"Though with joy I should be reeling
That at last you came my way,
There's no further use concealing
That I'm feeling far from gay,
For the rare allure about you
Makes me all the plainer see
How inane, how vain, how empty life without you would be.

After you, who
Could supply my sky of blue?
After you, who
Could I love?
After you, why
Should I take the time to try,
For who else could qualify
After you, who?
Hold my hand and swear
You'll never cease to care,
For without you there what could I do?
I could search years
But who else could change my tears
Into laughter after you?",After You've Gone [DVD][*]

That would bore me terrific'ly too

Though roosters they, I will not play the hen!

He'll always stay at home at night and make no criticism;
Though you may call it love, the doctors call it rheumatism!

Since love is blind, then from the mind all womankind should rout them!

The minute my eyes open in the morning.
Out on some highway, or pulling in the driveway.
Clear blue sky or when it's thunder storming.
My mind just can't escape you,
The first time I touched you, that's when I knew.

I want you trust me, I want you to love me,
I want you to need me like I'm something you can't lose.
I want you to save me, I want you to crave me
Even when I can't find my way to you.
If you ever once doubt, anything I'm about,
All it ever comes down to, girl I just want you.

When your holding everything together for me.
The way you revealed me, the way that you feel me.
The way you know I'm holding something inside.

But as long as I'm here, one thing I'm sure of

I want you trust me, I want you to love me,

And they danced on the hood
She was sitting on the shining light
Then gave you that look
They were in her eyes, she couldn't hide 'em
By the end of the night, you were falling just like stars

She fell from 'em so you point your prayers at 'em
'Cause she's got you feeling about as high as 'em

Since you stopped and filled up
With a red and black one at the Texaco
She hopped in your truck
Sang alone with one on the radio
Big red one going down

And we were right away running the town

She's the kinda girl that walks in to your lonely world
And everything dark just lights up
But all summers end, now she's gone with the wind
And the reason I spend so many nights up

Somebody, somebody should've told her

I wish somebody would've told her

Like I was just with her here
Well, she had the magic and I had the habit
But then she just disappeared

See, I'm the kinda guy that just can't get her off my mind
No matter how hard I try, she's all I think about

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

Only know you love her when you let her go

I'll understand
Then in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day
He'll build a little home

From which I'll never roam

We'd babaret until the break of day
I'll bet we've danced many a mile
I'll like to see a movie once more
They don't keep people staying up until four

Wouldn't it be a pleasant novelty to tumble in early once more?

Sleepy time gal, you're turning night into day
Sleepy time gal, you've danced the ev'ning away
Before each silvery star fades out of sight
Please give me one little kiss
Then let us whisper 'goodnight' 
It's getting' lat and dear your pillow's waitin'

Sleepy time gal, when all your dancin' is through
Sleepy time gal I'll find a cottage for you
You'll learn to cook and to sew
What's more you'll love it I know
When you're a stay-at-home , play-at-home
Eight o'clock sleepy time gal.

Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a kitchenette only for you?
Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a table set only for two?
I'd get a big victrola and then
We'll start in dancing ev'ry new dance again
Then it will be a pleasant novelty to tumble in just about ten.

Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Knows that I have to be

Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love.

Without a dream in my heart

And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

I'm discontented with homes that are rented so I have invented my own.
Darling this place is a lover's oasis where life's weary chase is unknown.
Far from the cry of the city, where flowers pretty caress the streams,
Cozy to hide in, to love side-by-side in. Don't let it abide in my dreams.

Picture you upon my knee, just tea for two and two for tea, 
Just me for you and you for me, alone! 
Nobody near us, to see us or hear us, 
No friends or relations on weekend vacations,
We won't have it known, dear, that we have a telephone, dear. 
Day will break and you'll awake and start to bake 
A sugar cake for me to take for all the boys to see.
We will raise a family, a boy for you, a girl for me, 
Oh, can't you see how happy life would be?

You are revealing a plan so appealing I can't help but falling for you,
Darling, I planned it; can't you understand it is yours to command it, so do.
All of your schemes I'm admiring, they're worth desiring but can't you see,
I'd like to wait there for some future date dear; 
it won't be too late, dear, for me.

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
