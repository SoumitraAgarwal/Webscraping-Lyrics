Anthony Newley,"You know the game of love, so the flame never burns you
No passion concerns you, no violins play
But me, I lose control of my heart when I'm near you
That's why I fear you and turn away
I need a love that's true, I wish it could be you
I know it should be you and so I say....

All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say ""No, No""
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All
Anthony Newley,"the dreams I dreamed went up in smoke.
They didn't pan out as I had intended; 
I should know how to take a joke.

I'll go my way by myself, this is the end of romance. 
I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance. 
I'll try to apply myself and teach my heart to sing. 
I'll go my way by myself like a bird on the wing,
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.
I'll go my way by myself, here's how the comedy ends. 
I'll have to deny myself love and laughter and friends.
Grey clouds in sky above have put a blot on my fun. 
I'll try to fly high above for a place in the sun.
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone",By Myself
Anthony Newley,"Blackbird, blackbird singing the blues all day
Right outside of my door
Blackbird, blackbird who do you sit and say
There's no sunshine in store

All thru the winter you hung around
Now I begin to feel homeward bound
Blackbird, blackbird gotta be on my way
Where there's sunshine galore

Pack up all my care and woe
Here I go, singing low
Bye bye blackbird
Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she
Bye bye blackbird

No one here can love and understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light
I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, bye bye

Bluebird bluebird calling me far away
I've been longing for you
Bluebird bluebird what do I hear you say
Skies are turning to blue

I'm like a flower that's fading here
Where ev'ry hour is one long tear
Bluebird bluebird this is my lucky day
Now my dreams will come true

Pack up all my care and woe
Here I go, singing low
Bye bye blackbird
Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she
Bye bye blackbird

No one here can love and understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light
I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, bye bye",Bye Bye Blackbird
Anthony Newley,"I don't ever care to rise to power
I would rather be with you an hour
For the things that one can buy
Are not worth a lover's sigh

I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart
In my heart I have but one desire
And that one is you, no other will do

I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim
I just want to be the one you love
And with your admission that you feel the same
I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of, believe me

I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart",I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire
Anthony Newley,"Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And smile, smile, smile.
Don't let your joy and laughter hear the snag
Smile boys, that's the style
What's the use of worrying
It never was worth while
So, pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And smile, smile, smile.

Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And smile, smile, smile.
Just pucker up and whistle (Whistle)

What's the use of worrying
It never was worth while
So, pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And smile, smile, smile.",Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit-Bag
Anthony Newman,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear
Anthony Newman,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem
Anthony Ortega,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile

Anthony Ortega,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Anthony Paule,"Hey now boys take a look right here
Only one comes 'round every million years
She's a midnight rider on a shooting star
Makes the whole world ring like a big guitar

Well she flagged me down with the devil's sway
It was somewhere down that lost highway
She's a lifeboat on the raging sea
She's the high note in the harmony

She takes away my pain and sorrow
Loves me like there's no tomorrow
This, I can't resist
In my life I realize
I have never known a sweeter kiss
Honey what I missed

Got a piece of heaven right here on earth
And believe me I know what it's worth
She's an island dream on a rainy day
She's a desperado's hideaway

Hey now boys, take a look at right here
Only one comes 'round every million years
She's a midnight rider on a shooting star
Makes the whole ring like a big guitar",Big Guitar
Anthony Paule,"Oh what a price I had to pay
For loving you, you, you

I bought a house, a diamond ring
I had to give up everything
Oh what a price I had to pay
For loving you, you, you

I  stopped my rambling, I even stopped gambling
And I stopped staying out all night
Oh what a price I had to pay
For loving you, you, you

I tried so hard to do what's right
But you only wrecked my life
Oh what a price I had to pay
For loving you, you, you

You've heard my story. I've sung my song
So, goodbye baby, I'm gone
Oh what a price I had to pay
For loving you, you, you
",What a Price
Anthony Paule,"When you're young and so in love as we
And bewildered by the world we see
Why do people get a soul
Ony those in love would know
What a town without pity can do

If we stop to gaze upon a star
People talk about how ""bad"" we are
Ours is not an easy age
We're like tigers in a cage
What a town without pity can do

The young have problems
Many problems
We need an understanding heart
Why don't they help us
Try to help us
Before this plain granted planet falls apart

Take these eager lips and hold me fast
I'm afraid this kind of joy can't last
How can we keep love alive
How can anything survive
When these little minds tear you in two
What a town without pity can do

How can we keep love alive
How can anything survive
When these little minds tear you in two
What a town without a pity can do
No it isn't very pretty 
What a town without pity can do
",Town Without Pity
Anthony Phillips,"God If I Saw Her Now
  

""Rest your head my love; 
Rest your tired limbs;
Leave your mind at peace, at peace, at peace,
What are you thinking now?""
 
""Thinking of a girl
As golden as the sun
She loved me not like you, like you, like you""
""Pray do you love me more?""
 
""It's hard to say for sure,
A child, sixteen, was I
Both virgins did we buy, we buy, we buy""
""You loved her more than me"".
 
""She left me one dark night
She took my heart for free
I've seen her not since then, since then, since then,
God if I saw her now.""

Anthony Phillips,"Master of Time


 See, the days grown long 
Winter comes upon us 
Like a storm at sea. 
And the will to live  
Seems a little thin sometimes 
When those you love are 
Lost beneath the snowfall. 
  
""Give and you will live"", 
Said a man who lived  
In a funny way. 
So we share our cup 
With the thirsty fawn of life 
Who leaves us on the  
Highway without water. 
  
Master of Time, take me back through the years. 
Master of Time, let me try once again 
And I will give more, oh how I'll try, 
And with this, a new life I'll buy. 
  
Hush! The marsh-duck cries, 
Far away, she knows 
That her love will be, 
And she nestles down, 
Sobbing still, she dries her eyes, 
Knowing that the world 
Will cry the rest out. 
  
Where did beauty go? 
Seek it here, there 
But it's slipped away. 
And when they come to lay me down, 
I will take your memory too, 
They'll know that in my final hour, 
I loved you. 
  
Master of Time, take me back through the years. 
Master of Time, let me try once again 
And I will give more, oh how I'll try, 
And with this, a new life I'll buy.",Master of Time [*][Demo Version]
Anthony Phillips,"Seven long years have gone by,
Scattered on the wind,
Fortunes made and squandered,
Ardour's beacon growing dim.
 
Seven long years have now past
Neither glimpse nor word
Of the jewel that vanished
Though the case lay undisturbed.
 
Seven long years have I spent
Trying to forget,
But no man can banish
Heaven he has sought and met.
 
Through the trials and the tears
Still I cannot learn,
Ever hopeless dreaming
Perhaps some day you will return.",Seven Long Years
Anthony Phillips,"I hear the birds come greet me in my morning,
They sing the songs of love in tongues of ages past,
And all the while a vision is unfolding,
The Moorhen pipes at me, ""don't sleep the day away"".
And so with cautious steps I tread
A measured path through vale and rook,
And many signs you'd want to take me with you.
And I go down to the Landing,
Heron's Flood flows on storm-clothed
As the harbour lights guide the wanderers home.
I see the sun come greet me in his dawning,
He holds the seed of life within his aged hands.
And, in the sky, a vast procession streaming,
Royal banners held aloft to mark the halcyon time.
And so I walk in meads below,
Amongst the springs and weevil-gall,
In myriad throngs the grass will take me with you.
And I climb up to the Hawk's Throne,
Cragshorn lies at Umbrian
And the marram-slopes span the sapient sky.
I feel the night come bidding me his greeting,
He draws a glowing veil upon a sleepy world.
And in the sky the stars roll through the heavens,
Below, the new-hatched dove stares wondrously above.
And so to Esma I am come
To forge a passageway through time
And all, too soon, you'd come to take me with you.
And I strike north to the veldt-plains,
Dorn Ridge melts in snow-gold.
As the Moorhen
Pipes the pinkery moon.
Birdsong, so sweetly, hear them calling you
Birdsong, so sweetly, hark they're calling you.",Birdsong
Anthony Phillips,"Hear, a West Wind calling,
I hear it calling my name,
Snow, on Greenland falling,
The ice is melting away.
Sitting in a greenhouse painted green,
None to be picked and none to be seen;
Standing by a harbour soaking rain,
Why must the sky bring rain back again?
Wake, an angel talking,
She's asking ""black, white or nun?""
Drake, from Plymouth streaking,
He sinks the galleons with the guns.
Climbing up a creeper chasing flies,
Unzip their wings and look in their eyes;
Standing on a steeple stitching time
Time to be saved and time to be nine.
Footsteps in a blizzard point the way to go
Heads of marble snow men, miles and miles from home.
Sleeping on an Interstellar Plane.
Sitting in a greenhouse painted green
None to be picked and none to be seen
Sleeping on an Interstellar Plane
Will we return to find it again?",Greenhouse
Anthony Phillips,"Every little thing she's wanted
Every little thing she's had to get
Every single thing she's squandered
Every single thing she's had to let.
Moonshooter, as free as ebbing tide
Moonshooter, no gaping cracks to hide
Some at the windows
Some at the lights
Carry on shooting your moons...
Maybe we'll come back soon
Yes we will come back soon.
Florida is where you'll find her
Lazing in the sticky summer sun
Living in a dying city
Waiting for the travelling troupes to come
Moonshooter, as free as ebbing tide
Moonshooter, no gaping cracks to hide
Some at the windows
Some at the lights
Carry on shooting your moons...
Maybe we'll come back soon
Yes we will come back soon.
Moonshooter, as free as ebbing tide
Moonshooter, no gaping cracks to hide

Some in the night
Carry on shooting your moons...

Yes I will come back soon.",Moonshooter
Anthony Phillips,"Flashing meteors follow
Comets climb in startling numbers,
And the saucers slip by upon the Milky Way.
Marking time, counting sheep on Venus,
Stranded here in ether
I couldn't get my feet into a windbreak today.
Pulling faces and swopping places
Grab the bull by the horns
But still I seem to be torn
From the plough I have
Seen the earth rise
And the bear sailed away...
Correlating clusters
Destination undecided
As the Virgan Voice cries ""Proceed to Orion""
Lighting years with Aurora's beacon
Banished here for treason
They didn't give a reason for this sentence in space
Pulling faces and swopping places
Grab the bull by the horns
But still I seem to be torn
From the pole I have
Seen the crab rise
And the fish flew away...
Pulling faces in empty places
And now at last we're forewarned
And though the bull's lost his horns
After years trekking
Through the starglow,
It's the end of the universe.",Pulling Faces
Anthony Phillips,"Regrets, yes I have many,
But none so great as spurning your love.
For how sweet, how sweet your love would be
As fierce as fire, as tender as dew.
So let the rain fall
Crashing on me
And blind my eyes
For the love I can't feel.
Take a sound, don't you wait, don't be hurried
Make a sign, don't be late, don't you worry now.
Sometimes, I would have you close to me
And take the path that leads to the sea.
In the dark our eyes would meet at last
And on your lips, the words I must flee.
So let the rain fall
Crashing on me
And blind my eyes
For the love I can't feel.
Take a sound, don't you wait, don't be hurried
Make a sign, don't be late, don't you worry now.
So let the rain fall
Crashing on me
And blind my eyes
For the love I can't feel.
Pulling out while the doubts loom above me
Shouting out in the dark for you to love me
Cutting life from the hopes of an outstretched hand
Regrets, our secret cemeteries,
Where loves and loss are silently lain,
The dream is fading faster now,
And soon you'll skip beyond my recall.",Regrets
Anthony Phillips,"August saw a contest fit for Kings
From far and wide they came to trade their swings
Little grubs with stone-age clubs and tanners' sons
With foxes' gloves
They came face to face the stiffest coarse since Tring
Harold took an eight-iron at the first
Hopped the hedge while Tostig chipped and cursed
Sliced into a sticky patch and, playing out, he'd met his match
When lettuce leaves had made the crowd disperse
So, we're all as we lie
We're all as we're lying
No, don't tell me it's time,
It's all in the timing.
Getting wiser, so much wiser, introspected ostraciser,
Drinking up with no holes barred to play..
Daphne lay beside the Silent Pool,
When suddenly the air began to cool
Otto heard it, running back, and tried to stop the thudding crack
As Luther strode up, crying ""Winter Rules"".
""Holy Mackerel"", cried the Papal Prince,
""You're out of bounds I'm really quite convinced"".
Luther drew his driver but the Pope pulled out a fiver
And they halved the hole on points of sacraments
So, we're all as we lie
We're all as we're lying
No, don't tell me it's time,
It's all in the timing.
Getting wiser, so much wiser, Seven Sister sympathiser
Drinking up with no holes left to play.
The hour of confrontation now was nigh
As Plato and Justinian were tied,
Locked in mortal combat firing vulture after wombat
Their supremacy now could not be denied.
The Seventeenth lay waiting for the pair
As both advanced with silent, ashen stares
But there they stood, incredulous, the distance
Reading ""Nebulous""
And ""Best of luck, Buzz Aldrin beat you there"".
So, we're all as we lie
We're all as we're lying
No, don't tell me it's time,

So, we're all as we lie
We're all as we're lying
No, don't tell me it's time,
Or else I'll be crying.",We're All as We Lie
Anthony Phillips,"Four thousand monks in a maelstrom
All crying out for release.
Three cheers for old Mother Hailsham
She's sticking to her beliefs.
A hundred ships took to the high seas
Intent on sailing the world.
They might have known that a rainy sky
Would scatter swine before pearls.
One by One, the Centaur is breaking its chains
And, after all, we're blood and flesh and pain.

Across the stakes they did swarm.

He said he'd just been for fun.
Hour by hour, the Jigsaw is piecing together
In fear and dread, we wait the final act.
Gathering up high, gathering up low,

There we are, oh God if only
Either one of us would go away
Where we are, is next to nowhere

Even the highway just hates to go there
Nothing in the world could make it stay
Why do we sit here in misery
Is it democracy or just insane?

You and your yen to be high in society
Speaking financially, it looks like rain:
And you say ""boy, you better be nice to me
 
I'll take what is coming to you
I'll take all the property too""

Couldn't he have found another way?",Holy Deadlock

Stallions kick and moan
All along the ridge the stormy light
Assailing the fortresses of stone
Father Eli took his watch,
His keen eyes fixed right into the sky
Daybreak rose, his chair was rocking still
No message could anyone find
Yena had a secret dream,
To touch the stuccoed stars
From the deep of snow-enchanted woods
He called them from afar
Hunter's by the Deadman's Spit
All struck dumb, the forest crowned in flame
The dragon rose into the burning air
Then everything lay still again - and so it's..

Baronesses played a hand of whist
Unseeing, the monolithic host
Meters racing, dials jammed,
The heat sears, the metal twists and tears
They're all out on Pan Am 109
The giants melted into thin air... and hear me...
Oh, my time has come
I never hoped for something quite like this
Oh I wait in the night
I'd packed my bags by ten past six
Subscriptions paid and sent
Through the fields to the landing strip
I'll always wonder what you meant
Diamonds dancing, mountains shake
Wind bellows, the valley struck with gold,
With my photo of the Prince of Wales,
I might not get back there till you're old...

So socially unattainable
Down the line in Balham Johnny's keen
Pursuing the unobtainable

 She's spinning you like a circus wheel.'
By moonlight, scheming all his moves
Detectives at her heels
Sally, what's your game?
What are you trying to do?
Sally, I'm miles away
I can't take my eyes off you
Tea with the Princes, dinner with the stars
She's cool amongst High Society
Johnny takes her to a wimpey bar
And acts with perfect sobriety

Taking off for ten weeks on the Nile
The nights will be rich with mystery

Sure am glad to meet ya
Let me show ya stuff
That only big boys know

Nickels might be bigger
But dimes are worth the most
Santa's always in the mall
But he lives at the North Pole
Kid stick with me and you'll go far
'Cause I'll show you the ropes

'Cause in all these years
I've learned many things
How to walk, how to talk
And make believe
So follow me

As you get of age you'll take my radio flier
And there's Indians in the woods
Just off the porch out back

And if they attack, I'll help you fight 'em
With sticks for guns, me and you
Until we've won
'Cause that's what brothers do

Mama said that you're the reason
Her belly got so big
And I didn't believer her
Until she let me feel ya kick

And I don't know how it happened
I'm just glad
That I have someone to play with

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

That swings so cool and sways so gentle

Anthony Warlow,"I'm nobody's baby
I wonder why
Each night and day I pray the Lord up above
Please send me down somebody to love

But nobody wants me
I'm blue somehow
Won't someone hear my plea and take a chance with me
Because I'm nobody's baby now

Nobody's baby
And I've got to know the reason why
Last week I was walking down the street and met a boy and I said
""Hey! Maybe I was meant for you""
But he only shook his head and said ""Goodbye""
He kept on walking down the avenue

Anthony Warlow,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you

Anthony Warlow,"You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap!

Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap
You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart, until your heart just goes wap!

Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map

You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map

And then you wonder how it all came about
It's too late now there's no gettin' out
You fell in love, and love is the tender trap",The Tender Trap
Anthony Way,"The holly and the ivy,
When they are both full grown
Of all the trees that are in the wood

And the running of the deer

The holly bears a blossom
As white as lily flower
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
To be our sweet Saviour
O the rising of the sun
And the running of the deer
The playing of the merry organ
Sweet singing of the choir

As red as any blood
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
To do poor sinners good

As sharp as any thorn;
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
On Christmas Day in the morn.

As bitter as any gall;
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ

Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?

Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe

Turned every stone

Too soon, too soon,

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here

I'll do my best to make him stay

I know we both won't say a word

Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

'cause we stretched our boundaries
We opened the door

We do what we like, we don't care where we fit

So listen up close or you might get dissed
Go drain the lizard or take a piss...

Kick you and your father back in place

Frankie's never on time he's always...

I put my money in the bank
They cut their crack, they offer joints
We don't do drugs do you get our meaning...

But we like to be different and not cliche
Well they say rap and metal can never mix
Well all of them can suck our...(dicks)

But I can't and I never did, what'd you expect me to give?
You never deserved my respect

What am I gonna do? I can't look at you
Can't look like you, I'm no hypocrite
What are you gonna do? You love to look at you
Don't have a clue, you're no hypocrite

Still you're grasping for air
Miles and miles you move
Into the abyss you stare
(Into the abyss you stare)

Running from the plight
Mighty grips its hold
And that hunger's hanging on
But never return to the fold

With endurance
As the earth behind you burns
You can feel the heat
Keep your will and never turn

Come on, come on, follow closely
Come on, come on, end this slavery
Come on, come on, where you're going
Any place but here

And you pray for more hope
So this will run its course
Everyday you move
Handcuffs lose they their force
(Handcuffs lose they their force)

Abandon all you know
So destitution hides
United in despair
Still makes it harder to divide

With exhaustion
As the earth behind you melts
You can feel the heat
But your need for living fails

Come on, come on, end this slavery
Come on, come on, where you're going

There's ways to kill the giant
Slaughtered by pins

You just can't let it lay
Welcome to your nightmare
Your whole life's on the way,
Today

You're no good, misunderstood, A.I.R.
All their hopes and visions, of what they want you to be
Crucial times, made up minds, A.I.R.
So high and mighty, though much too blind to see

Who are you gonna live your life for?
Conformity will trap you like a locked door
Independence means owning your decisions
Authority will put your soul in prison

Fight, or go insane, there's no one else to blame
Stop, their influence, you can't give them a chance
Break, right through the wall, that separates us all
Start, your second life, without their hands in sight

You got your pride, you got your visions
Don't subside, don't ever give in
Don't compromise just keep on grinning
The games they play you just keep on winning
Keep on winning
Keep on winning
Keep on winning

But it's cold and forsaken there without you now

I wanted to dive into the ocean of love
But I got shipwrecked on the shores of broken dreams

For you I sang songs of the nightswan
And each line I wrote was a beat of my heart

Forever burning on love's funeral pyre:
Stop beating now, my bleeding heart!
For this knife did cut too deep
So for the last time I'm trying not to breathe

Once there was a fire in the lighthouse of my heart:
I gave you so much more than just my love
And you broke so much more than just a promise

Our planet vanished so devastatingly
Amongst the mists of time
There was no treasure to be found at Rainbow's End
Somewhere behind Andromeda

I've been waiting till the end of December
But no more will I ride
For the winter solstice's child
Will pass away silently on a midsummer's night

So may you come now, my Dead Romantic Angel
Serenade Kyrahnean Hymns to me
Hold me in your arms
Cover me with elder flowers
And take me down to my beloved sea

I'm so tired, so tremendously tired
Please wait for me under the midgnight sun
Where I will sing and dance again
And my laughter will be heard
Echoing down the hillside again...

Oh, how I tried to believe how I loved,
How I tried to hold on to my dream;
How I wanted to live - but now I'm going home
To a place where love is more
Than just a four-letter word
And as I kiss the memory of your goodnight
I'm beginning to see the light...

I let you pile them so high.
Now I know better 'cause
I don't trust you anymore.

You can't manipulate me.
Nothing you say I'll believe.
I see right through you and
I won't take that anymore.

Where I've been thrown and mislead,
Never again because
I won't take that.

Antigone Rising,"Driving down a dark road
On the last night of his life
Michael's in the back seat
Thinking every thing's alright
He was young, and so invincible

The radio was blasting
In the car he got from dad
Tail lights in the distance
Are the last of him I have
And it's all so inconceivable

When they told me you were gone
Hated God for what he'd done
I'm trying hard to understand
And I know I shouldn't want this to be
Someone else instead of you
I thought you were so invincible

Four o'clock in the morning
Before the break of dawn
Michael left forever
From the town where he was born
And I woke up crying, 'cause I knew you were gone

And it hurts to miss you everyday
Feeling never goes away
I'm trying hard to understand
And I drive the streets we grew up on
I can't believe it's been that long
I thought we were so invincible

I want to change the way the story goes
Why can't it have a happy ending?

Driving down a dark road
On an endless summer's night
Michael's in the back seat
And he makes it home alright

And at night he whispers in my ear
Hear his voice so loud and clear
He tries to help me understand
That he'll always be right by my side
A part of him will never die
That's what made him so invincible
So invincible, so invincible, alright",Michael

Or just what it means

If you try to find me
My number's not the same
Hang my hat up on negative lane

People keep asking how I've been
Because of the state of mind I'm in
There's a million places I swore I would be by now

Radio songs all sound the same
I almost played in to that whole game
But the boy's club hung a sign that said ""no girls allowed""

Or just what it means
But the scars remind me of exactly where I've been

I sense a deception

From standing on line

It ends in happy ever after

Once upon a time

And what you reap

Wish it well
What you gave away
And bless what you keep

You're all caught up in love
And wishes that won't come true

Looking for a ride
Got a smile to hide
All the rain in my eyes
And your bags are full with loving goodbyes
I don't care if I never grow up
Don't want to shrink in a suit
Don't want live just to suck someones bones dry
I'd rather die
Each time I think back to my home town
And my sad skinny self standing around
Waiting, watching, wishing for something to happen
I used to dream about a girl like you
Hair dyed black and eyes jet blue
Desperately trying and searching for something fantastic
We've been here before
Stood up at the door
Holding secrets we'd never say
Hey, don't hang your head
Feel the breeze instead
Fear no shadow, don't feel no shame
All it took was one punch in the face
To make me want to steal the guys car in the first place
The grass on the suburban lawns never looked so black
Crack in the window
Slip in through the door
Hand me your hair-pin
Your knees to the floor
Head to the highway
Never turning back
We're never turning back
We're never turning back
We're never turning back
We're never turning back
Car by car
And line by line
One day you'll find your place
And I'll find mine
In a new time
In a strange new place
Get up, get up, get down
On and on and on we go
We got no radio
Singing songs we know
For miles and miles on open road
Get up, get up, let's go
We've been here before
Stood up at the door
Holding secrets we'd never say
Hey, don't hang your head
Feel the breeze instead
Fear no shadow, don't feel no shame

Small city strange
The kind that I know
Where you learn to play Marco Polo
Learned how to run when you dared to get too close

All my guarantees are under one moon
Called New Jersey where my sad song's
Not the only one worth holding on and holding on to

So how do you how do you say
I am so sorry when it's far too late
Maybe if you could see who I've become
Cause it's not like the other me

I was ankle deep but then I dove down
To the sweet and sour bottom
Where your memory is holding on it's holding on to me

On an early August morning under clouds

He buys her diamond rings, he's always listening
He tells her everything
All those things that a girl would ever want to hear

And a half devoured Harlequin novella
You are much much too young to be leaving with no one
But Fabio in tight jeans

He'll give her Mexico tied up in a bow
And all the girls she knows green with envy
Wishing they met one as cavalier
But that's not truly love Rosita dear

Your heart and soul away

Que tiembla, bandoneón
Y busca en el licor que aturda
La curda que al final
Termine la función

Al corazón

Un poco de recuerdo y sinsabor
Gotea tu rezongo lerdo
Marea tu licor y arrea
La tropilla de la zurda
Al volcar la ultima curda

Cerrame el ventanal, que arrastra el sol
Su lento caracol de sueño
No ves que vengo de un país
Que esta de olvido siempre gris
Tras el alcohol

Contame tu condena
Decime tu fracaso
No ves la pena que me ha herido?
Y háblame simplemente
De aquel amor ausente
Tras un retazo del olvido

Ya sé que me hace daño
Yo sé que te lastimó

To hide what's deep inside,

You know I will listen,
You know I will never judge,
Although there are preaches,
That maybe right or wrong,
Some things cannot be undone.

Anyhow, anyway, anymore.

We were captured in between,
These valant calm estates,
And nothing seems like we planned.
But those are fears that are unknown,
Will stand pn their own,
So don't be afraid, to take my hand.

You, are my angel,
A soul with your wings of gold,
I'm the one to feel you breathe,
I'm the one to touch your face,
And boy, you're mine to embrace.

Somewhere someone is standing at the foothills of their dreams
Someone got a paintbrush, is painting over doubts

Someone was captive and found the courage to get off
From a boulder in the well, somewhere the rain has stopped
Someone is finding the place where they belong

Everyday is summer somewhere in the world
And the summer boys are headed for the falls to kiss the girls
With their impatient hands groping honey breasts and curls

If the love isn't bright enough the corn won't grow
If the night isn't dark enough the moon won't glow

While the safe man counts his blessings, the hungry man has beans
There's a million people praying, raising up their eyes

So we celebrate everything we can think to celebrate

Putting in your two cents
Still feel like you're walking in a shoe box
Mapping out a dead end

In the uncharted countries
Out on ecstasy's borders
You have seen the reflections

There's laughter in your cities
Light bulbs in your attics
Stand against the darkness of the outback
The darkness of the road
In the depths of your dreaming
In the cracks in the ceiling
You have seen the revealing

What if the diamond on your hand
Was just a common ten cent ring?
What if your ice castles melt down to water?
What if your great walls remained
As little more than cellophane
At the end of the day?

When you move out
Of the desert everything changes
Back then you had no regard
For all that you came with
Now the sun is setting
On the unmoved faces
Of your own congregation

What if the diamond on your hand
Was just a common ten cent ring?
What if your ice castles melt down to water?
What if your great walls remained
As little more than cellophane
At the end of the day?

Still no rockabye
Sing out your lullaby
Cause you will never know why
Your truth is your brother's lie

What if the diamond on your hand
Was just a common ten cent ring?
What if your ice castles melt down to water?
What if all your matches
Burn down to your fingertips

Without ever lighting a fire?
What if your great walls remained

End of the day?

And all the infidels get in their cars
As a father is floating, ?
And driven into your heart

'Cause you live in a town that is delicate
Where old grudges run deeper than mud
Where peace is a term that is relative
And written in blood

Jerusalem, Jerusalem
Oh, you lie bleeding in the doorways of Eden
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Jerusalem

Another city wakes up in the morning
You are the martyr who is taking the stage
You're laying flowers on the eyes of your brother
In his funeral parade

And you are filled with a love for your people
All your life you have drunk bitter milk

You say, ""The ones who have wounded my brother
Are the ones I must kill""

Jerusalem, Jerusalem
Oh, you lie bleeding in the doorways of Eden
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Jerusalem

Now the blood has run down to a stand
For generations, it's marked up the sand
Where the scars are as deep as the rivers
And as old as the land

Your god's armies, they are marching on heaven
In the name of what is holy and sacred
Casting poisonous seeds for their children to reap
Out of the rubbles of hatred

Jerusalem, Jerusalem
Oh, you lie bleeding in the doorways of Eden

And when you're sending off your bare foot little girl
Won't you say a prayer for her?

But you can hold onto your cross
Get down on your knees
Pray to your Jesus
But he packed his suitcase long ago
Threw up his hand and thus he spoke, 
""It's just no use
All of my love can't cure these blues
I'm going south

Mother, mother take good care
'Cause all they're handing out are tickets to nowhere

Who's going to take up the campaign
The politicians in command are washing their hands
They've got to tend the marching band

But I will break

'Cause I lied about the vertigo
And I have
Never been up this high
There'll be no safety net
When I fall right our of the sky
There will be no ambulance waiting
And I have no wings to fly

So we will meet on the borders, 
Barefoot and blessed
In colorful graveyards with flower bouquets for the dead

That I will not come to harm
But when the wind tugs my courage will you be my brother in arm

High above the ferriswheel lights
Might cause me to sway
But I am teaching myself to be brave

And I may break all my bones

Antone,"It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",Baby's Home/Antone's Home
Antonella Arancio,"Ya no pido tu atención 
Yo canto si me duele el corazón 
Y esa luz al horizonte a sido solo una ilusión 
Y me pierdo 
Y se pierde todo lo que estoy sintiendo 
Rebusco en el baúl de los recuerdos y no entiendo el porque, 
En que me equivoque 
Que tengo que hacer para que todo acabe bien 
Sigo con la esperanza de que algún día esta balanza me eleve 
Pero pierdo, follo y la espera me cansa 
Y soy, tantas cicatrices tantas heridas abiertas 
Yo puse la cuchilla encima y no me di ni cuenta 
Ejerzo presión si me descuido 
Y todo cobra su sentido cuando ya te has ido 
Y escribo
Pierdo la noción del tiempo y vuelo 
Hoy digo no duermo porque ya no tengo sueños 
Todo lo que quise lo he perdido 
Ahora solo pienso en lo que llegara y si me encontrara vivo 
Intento imaginar a mi vida si no fuera fase 
Como combatir lo que me sobre pase 
Es sencillo, se lo que necesito y lo que no 
La música estuvo a mi lado si el amor me abandono 
Y ahora dime, dime que soy triste 
Dime que no di lo que tuve que dar cuando tu lo pediste 
Son gajes del oficio cuando no se hace por vicio 
Sigue interrogando pero ya he perdido el juicio 

No quedaba tinta cuando yo quería tanto 
Y sigo vivo pero me has dejado solo 
No me gusto ni a mi mismo porque ya no me controlo 

No quedaba tinta cuando yo quería tanto 
Y sigo vivo pero me has dejado solo 
No me gusto ni a mi mismo

Creo que ya no me la juegan 
Y me da igual que no me quieran 
Me tengo a mi mismo y una música sincera 
Tengo la satisfacción de que no soy cualquiera 
Que puedo superar cada salto en esta carrera 
Soy todo lo que me propongo, de bueno tonto 
No me cuestiones todavía es pronto 
Soy superior a todos esos que dan guerra 
Sabes que mi talento vive hoy día bajo tierra 
Tengo la extraña sensación de no saber lo que es la vida 
Y por desgracia lo malo nunca se olvida 
Deja cicatrices, solo somos aprendices 
Olvídate, no dejare jamás que me utilices 
Tengo tantas cosas que contar 
A estas alturas de la vida nada me puede parar 
Tengo toda la fuerza del mundo pa gastarla 
Ya no quedan marcas de arañazos en la espalda 
Y mírame, dime lo que ves 
Cada vez mas fase y cada vez menos
Y tuve fallos, que me arrastraron a tus pies 
Te quiero bien lejos no me importa donde estés 
No tenéis ni p*** idea de todo lo que se sufre 
Ya no me fío de cualquiera que se cruce 
Soy sentimiento puro, eso jamás lo dudes 
Hoy me importa mas lo que tengo que lo que tuve 

No quedaba tinta cuando yo quería tanto 
Y sigo vivo pero me has dejado solo 
No me gusto ni a mi mismo porque ya no me controlo

Y cuando un nudo en la garganta te ahoga
Piensas que debes seguir confiada
Lo intentas y nada ya no aguantas así
Pasan los meses cuantos días y horas
Encuentros secretos corazones que lloran
Mira el espejo a ver si tu sonrisa
Esconde el dolor que guardas dentro de ti

Son los recuerdos del alma
Que te animan y te colman
Aunque te devuelven la calma
Y te ponen hoy de pie
Guardando bien en secreto
Los amores de ayer
Que has olvidado
Para que no duelan
Son los recuerdos de oro
Que de nuevo te enamoran
Aunque te devuelven la aurora
Y te ponen hoy de pie
Guardando bien en secreto
Los amores de ayer
Que has olvidado
Y ya no pueden volver

Cuando te dejan sola esos amigos
Que han compartido tanta gloria contigo
Solo te queda gritar a la luna
La desesperanza que esta dentro de ti
Pintas de nuevo las paredes de casa
Cambias cortinas mueves el sillón rosa
Te asomas fuera y notas que el tiempo
Jamás se repite y tú lo quieres así

Mas

Y te ponen hoy de pie
Guardando bien en secreto
Los amores de ayer
Que has olvidado
Y ya no pueden volver",Recuerdos del Alma

Antonella Ruggiero,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

Across the sand so I may keep

Antonella Ruggiero,"Capita spesso anche a me
Di rovistare tra
Tutti I miei ricordi

Capita di buttare via
Solo quello che
Mi ha fatto un po’ più male

Un po’ più male

Spettatrice attonita
Solitaria ma
Da lontano tutto è limpido
Da lontano nulla pesa più
Il sereno si intravede già
I temporali si allontanano

Capita spesso che ci sia
Chi ha un tesoro e
Lo perde in un giorno
Capita che la nostalgia
Rompa gli argini
Che frenano il pianto
Ma dall’altopiano
Stento a crederci
Che da lontano tutto è nitido
Da lontano in un attimo
Il sereno si intravede già
I temporali si allontanano",Da lontano

Quando ti svegli 
Quando esci dalla doccia 
Corri e non ti asciughi mai
Ti rivesti nel buio 
E leghi i tuoi capelli 
Un biglietto per me 
Sono pazza di te 
Non lo sai

E se il nostro poi 
Non fosse amore giuro 
Io non ti lascerei 
Se pensassi che di me 
Non te ne importa niente

Anche se non fossi un angelo 
Io non ti cambierei 
Perché sei bella bella bella 
Bella come sei 
Bella come ti vorrei

Che tesoro che sei 
Quando mi guardi 
Quando penso con qli stessi occhi 
Tu mi lascerai 
Che paura che hai 
Non mi sorprendi 
Perché stare con me 
Non è bere un caffè 
E tu lo ami

E se il nostro poi 
Non fosse amore giuro 
Io non ti lascerei 
Se pensassi che di me 
Non te ne importa niente

Anche se non fossi un angelo

Antonello Venditti,"Stare insieme a te 
È stata una partita, 
Va bene hai vinto tu, 
Tutto il resto è vita 
Ma se penso che l’amore 
È darsi tutto dal profondo 
In questa nostra storia 
Sono io che vado a fondo

Ci vorrebbe un amico 
Per poterti dimenticare, 
Ci vorrebbe un amico 
Per dimenticare il male, 
Ci vorrebbe un amico 
Qui per sempre al mio fianco, 
Ci vorrebbe un amico 
Nel dolore e nel rimpianto

Amore, amore illogico, 
Amore disperato, 
Lo vedi sto piangendo, 
Ma io ti ho perdonato 
E se amor che a nulla ho amato, 
Amore, amore mio perdona 
In questa notte fredda 
Mi basta una parola

Ci vorrebbe un amico 
Per poterti dimenticare, 
Ci vorrebbe un amico 
Per dimenticare il male, 
Ci vorrebbe un amico 
Qui per sempre al mio fianco, 
Ci vorrebbe un amico 
Nel dolore e nel rimpianto

Ma vivere con te 
È stata una partita 
Il gioco è stato duro 
Comunque sia finita 
Ma sarà la notte magica 
O forse l’emozione 
Io mi ritrovo solo 
Davanti al tuo portone

Ci vorrebbe un amico 
Per poterti dimenticare, 
Ci vorrebbe un amico 
Per dimenticare il male, 
Ci vorrebbe un amico 
Qui per sempre al mio fianco, 
Ci vorrebbe un amico 
Nel dolore e nel rimpianto",Ci Vorrebbe un Amico
Antonello Venditti,"Il nostro cane 
Non mi riconosce più, 
Altri profumi, 
Altre valigie da portar giù, 
Cerco le chiavi di casa 
Ma questa non è casa mia, 
Più mia

Quelli li ho portati via, 
Anche l’ultimo sguardo, 
L’ultima fotografia, 
Quella di nonna bambina, 
Che gioca con il cerchio in piazza, 
La piazza

Dimmelo tu cos’è, 
Quello che ancor ci manca, 
Quello che ancora non c’è, 
E che ti prende alle spalle 
E non ti fa tornare indietro, 
Più indietro

Oh, tu dimmelo tu cos’è

Scopare bene, 
Questa è la prima cosa, 
Cercare un’altra donna, 
Un’altra donna 
Che non sia troppo vuota, 
Per ritornare di sera 
E non sentirsi ancora soli, 
Ancora più soli

In questa notte di agosto 
Ogni stella al suo posto lassù, 
In questa notte di strada 
Quella che manca sei tu, 
In questa estate romana 
Di musica e fotografia 
Ancora più mia

Sei nel presente o nel passato
Sei tutto intero o sei ferito?
E quante volte mi hai tradito?
Solo le lacrime che fanno male
Quando mi stringi sul tuo cuore
Sono due lacrime che ci dividono
Quando mi prendi e gridi amore
Mitico amore dove sei stato?
Sei come un angelo smarrito
Chi ti ha spezzato?
Chi ti ha colpito?
Se questa notte chiedi aiuto
È ritornato il tempo
Di stare ancora insieme
La notte passerà
E non avrò paura
Di restare qui
Come ogni notte ad aspettarti

E tutta la città è allagata da questo temporale

Vive una città dove gli uomini sanno già volare,
E non c'è sesso senza amore, nessun inganno nessun dolore,
E vola l'anima leggera
Sarà quel che sarà, questa vita è solo un'autostrada,
Che mi porterà alla fine di questa giornata,
E sono niente senza amore, sei tu il rimpianto e il mio dolore
Che come il tempo mi consuma
Lo sai o non lo sai, che per me sei sempre tu la sola,
Chiama quando vuoi, basta un gesto forse una parola,
Che non c'è sesso senza amore, è dura legge nel mio cuore,
Che sono un'anima ribelle
Ricordati di me, della mia pelle, ricordati di te com'eri prima,
Il tempo lentamente ti consuma
Ma non c'è sesso e non c'è amore, ne tenerezza nel tuo cuore

Segue il filo delle tue labbra

Che mi ha vestito soltanto della tua nudità

Quando ti sei ripresa tutti I tuoi giocattoli
E ti sei tolta le scarpe
E hai inseguito gli scoiattoli
E ti sei bevuto un intero inverno

E una croce sul petto
E non ti devo chiedere
Non ti devo chiedere

Cosa avevi in mente?
Tutta un'altra vita
Cosa avevi in testa?
Una storia diversa
Da questa

Cosa avevi in mente
Quando hai scritto in grande
Non aiutatemi
Sull’asfalto pulito
Della strada sotto casa
Ed hai gridato al mondo
Non amatemi
E poi hai preso la mira
E hai sputato la cicca
E non ti devo chiedere

Tutta un'altra vita
Cosa avevi in testa?

Cosa avevi in mente?

Insultando tua madre
Che sembrava nella neve
E t'ho trovata in ginocchio
Le lacrime asciutte
Ma perché sono sempre
La peggiore di tutte
La peggiore di tutte

L'amore è un rito pagano
Per raccontare domani
A tua figlia chi eri, chi eri

Col migliore sorriso che ho

Senza muovere un passo
In amore vince solo

Che mentre ammetto alzo le spalle
Rassegnato come il sole
Dopo l'ennesimo temporale

Quanti giorni mi hai rubato
Senza che me ne accorgessi
Quanti ne hai restituiti
Dopo averli fatti a pezzi
Non ha più significato
Il nome che ti ho dato
Ricomincio dall'ultimo giorno rubato

Ti rincontro qui
Nel giardino che hai sempre amato
Dove il sole batte di rado
Il silenzio è la mia speranza
Ma tu ridi e non mi capisci
Pensi tutto sia come prima
Sempre pronta a ricatturarmi
Quando cerco di andare via

Quanti giorni mi hai rubato
Senza che me ne accorgessi
Quanti ne hai restituiti
Dopo averli fatti a pezzi
Non ha più significato
Il nome che ti ho dato

Ma la mia bocca chiede ancora della tua

Era un potro con más brío
Que otro caballo cualquiera
Y como yo lo hice mío
Resultó muy corredor.

Era lindo mi caballo
Era mi amigo más fiel
Ligerito como el rayo
Era de muy buena ley.

Cuando era de falsa rienda
Daba ventaja a su madre
Muy pronto dejó a su padre
Con dos cuerpos le ganó.

Era de pelo retinto
Rosalbo como un lucero
Muy fachoso mitotero
Y lindo de corazón.

Antonio Aguilar,"Un día veintiocho de enero
Como me hiere esa fecha
A don Lamberto Quintero
Lo seguía una camioneta
Iban con rumbo al Salado
No más a dar una vuelta

Pasaron el Carrizal
Iban tomando cerveza
Su compañero le dijo
Nos sigue una camioneta
Lamberto sonriendo dijo
Pa' que son las metralletas

Ya cerquita del Salado
Rugieron dos R-15
Ahí dejaron a un muerto
Enemigo de Lamberto
Quisieran que fuera cuento
Pero señores es cierto

Un hombre fuera de serie
Alegre y enamorado
Platicando con su novia
El estaba descuidado
Cuando unas balas certeras
La vida le arrebataron

Clínica Santa María
Tú vas a ser mi testigo
Dos días después de su muerte
Vuelven a sonar los tiros
Ahí quedaron diez hombres
Por esos mismos motivos

Puente que va a tierra blanca
Tú que lo viste pasar
Recuérdales que a Lamberto
Nunca se podrá olvidar
Yo por mi parte aseguro
Que hace falta en Culiacán

A las once de la noche
Conchita empezó a pensar
Voy a matar mi marido

Cuando ya estaba dormido
Conchita se le acercó

Antonio Aguilar,"Voy a cantarles un corrido muy mentado
Lo que ha pasado allí en la hacienda de la flor
La triste historia de un ranchero enamorado
Que fue borracho, parrandero y jugador

Juan se llamaba, y lo apodaban charrasqueado
Era valiente y arriesgado en el amor
A las mujeres más bonitas se llevaba
E esos campos no quedaba ni una flor

Un día domingo que se andaba emborrachando
A la cantina le corrieron a avisar
Cuídate Juan que por ahi te andan buscando
Son muchos hombres no te vayan a matar

No tuvo tiempo de montar en su caballo
Pistola en mano se le echaron de a montón
Estoy borracho les gritaba y soy buen gallo
Cuando una bala atravesó su corazón

Creció la milpa con la lluvia en el potrero
Y las palomas van volando al pedregal
Bonitos toros llevan hoy al coleadero
Que buen caballo va montando el caporal

Ya las campanas del santuario están doblando
Todos los fieles se dirigen a rezar
Y por el cerro los rancheros van bajando
A un hombre muerto que lo llevan a enterrar

En una choza muy humilde llora un niño
Y las mujeres se aconsejan y se van
Pero su madre lo consuela con cariño
Mirando al cielo llora y reza por su Juan

Aquí termino de cantar este corrido
De Juan ranchero, charrasqueado y burlador
Que se creyó de las mujeres consentido
Que fue borracho, parrandero y jugador

",Juan Charrasqueado
Antonio Aguilar,"De piedra ha de ser la cama
De piedra la cabecera
La mujer que a mí me quiera
Me ha de querer de a de veras, ay, ay
Corazón por qué no amas

Subí a la sala del crimen
Le pregunté al presidente
Que si es delito quererte
Que me sentencien a muerte, ay, ay
Corazón por qué no amas

El día que a mi me maten
Que sea de cinco balazos
Y estar cerquita de ti
Para morirme en tus brazos, ay, ay
Corazón por qué no amas

Por caja quiero un sarape
Por cruz mis dobles cananas
Y escriban sobre mi tumba
Mi último adiós con mil balas, ay, ay
Corazón por qué no amas

Ya no pelies con ninguno"" 

Quitese de aqui mi padre 
Que estoy mas bravo 
Que un leon no valla 
A sacar la espada

Que no me entierre en sagrado 
Que me entierre en tierra bruta

Felipe fue desgraciado 

Bajaron al toro prieto 
Que nunca lo habian bajado

Usaba pistolas con séis cargadoras le daba gusto a cualquiera.

Usaba el bigote en cuadro abultado,su paño al cuello enredado
Calzones de manta, chamarra de cuero, traía punteado el sombrero.

Sus piés campesinos usaban huaraches y a veces a raíz andaba
Pero le gustaba pagar los mariachis la plata no le importaba.

Con una botella de caña en la mano gritaba ""Viva Zapata!""
Porque era ranchero el indio suriano, era hijo de buena mata.

Era alto y bién dado, muy ancho de espaldas, su rostro mal encachado
Su negra mirada un aire le daba al buitre de las montañas.

Por éso en los pueblos donde se paseaba se la tenian sentenciada.

Sólo hojas secas que le ofrenda el bendaval

Que Villa duerme bajo el cielo de Chiguagua
Solo las aves que gorgean sobre Parral
Van a llorar sobre su tumba abandonada

Grabó en su tumba estoy presente General

Y que sus trinos se oigan en la serrania

Where shall I look for the love to replace you
Someone to light up my life
Someone with strange little ways
Eyes like a blue autumn haze
Someone with your laughing style
And a smile that I know will keep haunting me endlessly

Sometimes in stars or the swift flight of seabirds
I catch a moment of you
That's why I walk all alone
Searching for something unknown
Searching for something or someone to light up my life
",Someone to Light Up My Life (Se Todos Fossem Iguais a Você)
Antonio Carlos Jobim,"When I try to sing, you say I'm off key
Why can't you see how much this hurts me
With your perfect beauty and your perfect pitch
You're a perfect terror
When I come around must you always put me down

If you say my singing is off key, my love
You will hurt my feelings don't you see, my love
I wish I had an ear like yours
A voice that would behave
All I have is feeling and a voice gone deaf

You insist my music goes against the rules
Yes, but rules were never meant for lovesick fools
I wrote this little song for you, but you don't care
It's a crooked song, oh but all my heart is there

The things that you would see if you would do your part
Is even if I'm out of tune I have a gentle heart
I took your picture with my trusty Rollaflex
And now all I have developed is a complex

Possibly in vain I hope you weaken, oh my love
And forget these rigid rules that undermine my dream of
A life of love and music with someone who'll understand
That even though I may be out of tune
When I attempt to say how much I love you
All that matters is the message that I bring 
Which is my key one: I love you",Off Key (Desafinado)
Antonio Carlos Jobim,"Parece que dizes
Te amo, Maria
Na fotografia 
Estamos felizes 
Te ligo afobada 
E deixo confissões no gravador 
Vai ser engraçado 
Se tens um novo amor

Me vejo a teu lado 
Te amo? 
Não lembro 
Parece Dezembro 
De um ano dourado 
Parece bolero 
Te quero, te quero 
Dizer que não quero 
Teus beijos nunca mais 
Teus beijos nunca mais 

Não sei se eu ainda 
Te esqueço de fato 
No nosso retrato 
Pareço tão linda 
Te ligo ofegante 
E digo confusões no gravador 
É desconcertante

Meus olhos molhados

São anos dourados 
Ainda te quero

Antonio Carlos Jobim,"Isabella
Wake up the sun is coming 
Through the window
We're riding with the sun 
I feel your heart beat
The morning light plays in your eyes
With floating blue and white skyline
A city in the skies for Isabella
We're gazing through the clouds
We sail the wind rose (four winds)
The break of day sparks my desire 
And ocean waves won't quench the fire 
We kiss we're high, we're riders in the sky
The city lies below
A silhouette, a glow
A tale of passion
I close my eyes (full flaps downs)
You hold me tight
We touch the ground
Isabella
Our hopes are riding over the city
We search the busy streets
We're not alone here
The city lights flare my desire
A million tears won't quench the fire
And if it starts to rain 
We'll take a train",Isabella

Em que lago, em que serra, em que mar
Se oculta, escuta, Luiza

Que sem ela não pode ser

Não há beleza

Hão de ser milhões de abraços

Procurou um caminho e seguiu
Já descrente de um dia feliz
Quem chorou, chorou

A grande ilusão do carnaval 
A gente trabalha o ano inteiro 
Por um momento de sonho 
Pra fazer a fantasia 
De rei ou de pirata ou jardineira 
Pra tudo se acabar na quarta feira 
Tristeza não tem fim 
Felicidade sim

Que o vento vai levando pelo are 
Voa tão leve 
Mas tem a vida breve 
Precisa que haja vento sem parar

Nos olhos da minha namorada 
É como esta noite 
Passando, passando 
Em busca da madrugada

Sky, so vast is the sky, with far away clouds just wandering by,
Where do they go? oh I don't know, don't know;
Wind that speaks to the leaves, telling stories that no one believes,
Stories of love belong to you and to me.

Oh, dindi, if I only had words I would say all the beautiful
Things that I see when you're with me, oh my dindi.
Oh dindi, like the song of the wind in the trees, that's how my heart is
Singing dindi, happy dindi, when you're with me.

I love you more each day, yes I do, yes I do;
I'd let you go away, if you take me with you.

Don't you know, dindi, I'd be running and searching for you like a river that
Can't find the sea, that would be me without you, my dindi.
Can't find the sea that would be me without you dindi.

Like a river that can't find the sea, that would be me without you, my dindi.

Vem que eu te espero tremendo de amor

Em noite sem lua, pulei a cancela
Cai do cavalo, perdi Gabriela
Oh lua de cera, oh lua singela
Lua feiticeira cadê Gabriela?

Ontem vim de lá do Pilar
Inda ontem vim lá do Pilar
Já tô com vontade de ir por aí

E na corda da viola todo mundo sambar
E na corda da viola todo mundo sambar
Todo mundo sambar

Com sabor de fruta mordida

Todo amor que houver nessa vida

E ser artista no nosso convívio
Pelo inferno e céu de todo dia
Pra poesia que a gente não vive

Te alcance em cheio o mel e a ferida

Antonio Carlos Jobim,"Ah, se já perdemos a noção da hora
Se juntos já jogamos tudo fora
Me conta agora como hei de partir
Se, ao te conhecer, dei pra sonhar, fiz tantos desvarios
Rompi com o mundo, queimei meus navios
Me diz pra onde é que inda posso ir
Se nós, nas travessuras das noites eternas
Já confundimos tanto as nossas pernas
Diz com que pernas eu devo seguir
Se entornaste a nossa sorte pelo chão
Se na bagunça do teu coração
Meu sangue errou de veia e se perdeu
Como, se na desordem do armário embutido
Meu paletó enlaça o teu vestido
E o meu sapato inda pisa no teu
Como, se nos amamos feito dois pagãos
Teus seios inda estão nas minhas mãos
Me explica com que cara eu vou sair
Não, acho que estás te fazendo de tonta

Desse amor que eu nego tanto
Evito tanto

Volta sempre a enfeitiçar

Que num álbum de retratos
Eu teimo em colecionar

Lá vou eu de novo como um tolo
Procurar o desconsolo
Que cansei de conhecer

Ainda volto a lhe escrever

De lembranças do passado

Some kind of wild October gladness that I never thought I'd see
What has become of all my sadness all my endless lonely sighs
Where are my sorrows now
What happened to the frown and is that self contented clown
Standing grinning in the mirror really me
I'd like to run through Central Park carve your initials in the bark
Of every tree I pass for every one to see
I feel that I've gone back to childhood and I'm skipping through the wild wood
So excited that I don't know what to do
What do I care if I'm a juvenile I smile my secret little smile
Because I know the change in me is you

and trouble begins to brew
Whenever the winter winds become too strong
I concentrate on you

When fortune cries ""Nay, nay"" to me
People declare ""You're through""
Whenever the blues become my only songs
I concentrate on you

On your smile, so sweet, so tender
When at first my kiss you do decline
On the light in your eyes when you surrender
And once again our arms intertwine

And so when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true
To prove that even the wise men can be wrong

Makes my loneliness soon disappear

Though you're far away
I have only to close my eyes and you are back to stay
I just close my eyes 
And the sadness that missing you brings
Soon is gone and this heart of mine sings
Yes, I love you so 
And that for me is all I need to know
I will wait for you 
Till the sun falls from out of the sky

To this love, you were the world to me

From my infinite sadness you came
And brought me love again
Now I know that no matter what ever befalls 
I'll never let you go

I will hold you close
Make you stay

When it goes away
Love is the saddest thing when it goes away",Once I Loved [O Amor en Paz]

There's so many people who can talk and talk and talk
And just say nothing or nearly nothing

Se parli bene, menti

Non fare più commenti,
Non voglio chiarimenti,
Potresti solo peggiorare il quadro clinico.
Non c'è modo che io possa accettare
Questo modo di amare, prevalentemente ascetico.
Siamo come carne che è andata a male,
A forza di sorvolare sulle nostre falsità.

Ma nonostante tutto io non voglio perderti,
Voglio solo illudermi che va tutto bene.
Ma nonostante tutto proverò a difenderci
Dalle nostre deboli buone volontà.

Non trovo I miei indumenti,
Lo giuro altrimenti
Andremmo mano nella mano soli al cinema.
Tra scuse convenienti e falsi intendimenti,
Noi due portiamo avanti questa storia frigida.
Forse siamo poco inclini ad osare
Per paura di andare incontro ad una crisi isterica.
Nella vita se non provi a rischiare
Poi continui a sbagliare, non ti raccapezzi più.

Ma nonostante tutto io non voglio perderti,
Voglio solo illudermi che va tutto bene
Ma nonostante tutto proverò a difenderci

En este día turbio why gris,
Mi angustia rasgada
De escribir estas letras por ti.

El ansia me aturde
Por tenerte lejos de mí,
Desnudo el recuerdo
Que me asoma el día en que vi.

Que este hombre no entiende de lujos
Que se bebe los mares por ti,
Yo me acojo al verde de tus ojos
La esperanza que nunca perdí.

Que este hombre no entiende de lujos
Que se bebe los mares por ti,
Yo me acojo al verde de tus ojos
La esperanza que nunca perdí.

Me insulto al espejo
Por no haber arriesgado por ti,
El tiempo no cura
Las heridas que en mi alma sufrí.

Ahora me encuentro
Como un loco que busca entender,
Llevando en el canto
El aliento que nunca te di.

Que este hombre no entiende de lujos
Que se bebe los mares por ti,
Yo me acojo al verde de tus ojos
La esperanza que nunca perdí.

Pretendes con tiento que me abrace a ti,

Donde las historias cobran forma al fin,
Canciones que portan tus dulces caricias
Why a veces la rabia contenida en mí.

Envidio tu calma, tu amor why sufrir
Alabo la angustia que me haces sentir,
Amontono el consuelo,
Al saber que en silencio siempre estás ahí.

Adornas las noches del color canela
Buscando el encuentro con la soledad,
Bordando a destellos hasta aquellos momentos
En que me haces llorar.

Solo why sin perder el tiempo 
Disfrutando del silencio, 
Ladridos de fondo 
Con ecos lejanos, 
Descubren mi soledad encarnada. 

En el crepúsculo del alba 
Difuminándose de pronto, 
Las copas que resaltan 
En el cielo enrojecido, 
Secretos naturales.

Si estás solo te acompaña 
Con el miedo te molesta, 
Cuando cantas te acompasa 
En la noche te hipnotiza.

No sale en tu busca, 
Compases de silencio 
Que te embrujan muy despacio.

Déjate embrujar,

De lo que quiere que veas.

Te envuelve why te enreda.

Abren el arcón del recuerdo,
Rompiendo cadenas
Que hacen olvidar,
Que estoy vivo.

Pensar que puedes no es tan malo
Si quien lo piensa tiene manos
Yo tengo manos, hambre, fe y un corazón
Que no se vende por dinero
Pero se daña por complejo

Que se callen, los que critican mi salida
Los que no saben que vivir, es algo más que pasar hambre
Que no hablen, si no saben
Que se callen, que vale más perder la vida
Que no entender, que el corazón
No sabe de perder partidas
Que no hablen, si no saben

Lo llaman dinero, dinero, dinero, puto dinero",Que Se Callen

Quise contar lo que pasó
En el rincón sin nombre donde dormité

Contando a todo el mundo como iba a morir

Me equivoqué 
Y no encontré, como la otra vez
La forma de decirte

Más trincheras que cavemos
Más disparos, mas silencios
Y más lagrimas de enero

Sin saber si volveremos
Si el permiso será eterno
Que te sirvan éstas líneas
“pa” que sepas, que te quiero

Que no volvió al atardecer
Y yo encontré la carta que
No te envió, de titulo

Que sale de tus ojos
Esa luz que alumbra la distancia entre tú y yo

Que alumbra cada nota de mi voz

Mimando con susurros el temblor
De este amor, que se desboca

Antonio Orozco,"Paseando por el bazar de la esperanza te paraste a mirar
Donde siempre habían alas parecían que esperaban
Pocos días para probar las alas blancas que hoy me dejan volar
Como siempre me explicabas, cuando vuelas no hay mañana

Llevo aire en las espaldas y voy tras de ti
Los lamentos se acercaban a preguntar donde ir y como vivir

Ahora entiendo lo de detrás porque la vida no dejaba avanzar
No tenia alas y nadie me enseñaba
El misterio no tiene mas que aquella forma en la que debes mirar
Que los limites son nada cuando vuelas no hay mañana

Voy flotando sobre el tiempo muy cerca de ti
No hay ni cuandos ni pretextos, hoy todo esta aquí y no tiene fin 

Fijate un momento en lo perfecto no hay mas formas de elegir
Vivo desgranando los momentos , no hay mas formas de vivir
Vuelo muy alto sin miedo, contigo lo aprendí, contigo lo aprendí

Robo el tiempo sin avisar en tu mirada me lo quiero gastar
No hay otra manera,no hay peor espera 
Quedan fotos por revelar, las que guardan lo que esta por llegar
Son profundos mares los que adornan mis retales

Llevo aire en las espaldas, no entiendo de un fin 
Si este aire se me acaba, volveré a buscar, volveré a volar

Contigo sé vivir, contigo sé vivir",Aire en Las Espaldas
Antonio Orozco,"Apostado en el jardín del universo
De rodillas y esperando poco a poco mi momento

De un mismo sabor

Y el tiempo lleno de momentos 
Que se van perdiendo 
Dejándote la calle a media luz

Dueños del cajón de cuentos 
Que estuve escribiendo 
Por cada vez que el tren se me escapó

Pienso agarrarme fuerte a mi momento

Escapando cuando llega la tormenta
Descartando la reventa 
Y dejando atrás las cuentas

Esperando que los días sean perfectos
Que las musas tengan tiempo 
Y el futuro no sea incierto

Me quito la armadura
Sólo queda amor, esperanza y yo

Juntos el fondo que bajo el agua vive su entrega

Yo soy la piedra, tú eres la arena
Juntos el suelo sobre el que pesa nuestra condena

Obligados a vivir la realidad
Fuera del agua seré barro y mala hierba
Y que el destino desafíe la verdad 
Y se detenga, se detenga

Cariño mío, rosas y trigo no desesperan
Almas al viento vuelan contigo, vuelan conmigo
Cariño mío, leña de olivo no desesperes 
Que en el silencio ardo contigo, ardo contigo

Yo soy la orilla que tu orilla mira
Tú eres la orilla que a mí me mira
Separados por el río que la vida nos obliga
Somos una sola alma

Obligados a vivir la realidad
Fuera del agua seré barro y mala hierba
Y que el destino desafíe la verdad 
Y se detenga

Cariño mío, ángel prohibido no desesperes
Fuego que arde no tiene frío, no tiene frío
Cariño mío, fuego encendido no desesperes
Que cuando lloras crecen los ríos, crecen los ríos",Dos Orillas
Antonio Orozco,"Desperté a tu lado, desperté sin aire y desperté
¿sabes qué? jamás pensé que el tiempo fuese tiempo
Que mi vida fuese tuya y que mi aire fueran versos para ti
Desperté sabiendo que tus besos me acompañan
Que nada importa nada más que tu
¿sabes qué? te encontré

Encontré mi todo, encontré la calma y me encontré
¿sabes qué? jamás pensé que el antes nos gritara
Que el cielo nos mirara
Que el mar nos envidiara y te encontré
Sabiendo que mis miedos ya no hablan
Que nada importa nada más que tú
¿sabes qué? 

Eres la razón de mis mañanas
Eres todas mis batallas y eres una lluvia fresca en pleno abril
Eres una música con alma, eres tierra y eres agua
Eres tanto que no sé ni qué decir
Así no dejas que me pierda nunca
No hay dónde, ni verdad ni cuándo sin ti

Seré tu espejo, seré la palabra, seré
Y ¿sabes qué? así seré el primero cada día
Seré destino y rima, seré secreto y vida para ti, lo seré
Sabiéndome arquitecto de tus días, doctor y medicina para ti

¿sabes qué? eres la razón de mis mañanas
Eres todas mis batallas y eres una lluvia fresca en pleno abril
Eres una música con alma, eres tierra y eres agua
Eres tanto que no sé ni qué decir
Así no dejas que me pierda nunca, no hay dónde
Ni verdad ni cuándo no hay, no hay

Y la música calla, y los pies no me andan 
Y mi mundo no gira sin ti
Eres la razón de mis mañanas
Eres todas mis batallas y eres una lluvia fresca en pleno abril
Eres una música con alma, eres tierra y eres agua
Eres tanto que no sé ni qué decir
Así no dejas que me pierda nunca, no hay dónde

Antonio Orozco,"Siempre fue mucho más fácil esperar al sol
Que no andar buscando
Siempre fue mucho más fácil despertar contigo
Que no hacerlo solo
Siempre fue mucho más fácil

Hoy quizás lo más difícil
Es saber que todo se fue marchitando
Sabes que lo nuestro no era, lo nuestro
Era mucho más de lo que estoy contando
Hoy es mucho más difícil, hoy es mucho mas difícil
Que volar sin alas, que nadar sin agua
Que caer sabiendo que ya estoy sentado

¿Sabes? Somos dueños, somos vida y somos versos
Somos como el eco del que tuvo mucho más que besos
Somos los que saben, los que dicen lo que vale
Los que inventan los paseos
Que hoy nos dejan ser honestos

Siempre fue mucho más fácil decir te quiero
Que tener que imaginárselo

Hoy quizás lo que fue nuestro

que aquí no ha pasado nada

de tripas corazón

Voy a contar la esperanza 
con los dedos de la mano

Que a pesar de mi suerte
yo no me rindo hasta la muerte
Es que me niego a saber que hoy

Se te olvida lo que fuimos
las mañanas que vivimos
los silencios compartidos 
y el camino que elegimos

Qué poquito es lo que queda 
cuando alguien se cansa de decir

Voy a hacer las cuentas 
y a restar las puñaladas
a ver si en la suma ganas

que aquí sigo aunque me duela
que esto tiene solución

Y decirte que con esto no hay quien pueda

Antonio Orozco,"Hoy sé que mis palabras no lo saben
Y tal vez, tal vez, sea mi primera vez
Hoy sé que mi vida te esperaba
Y ya me ves, ya ves poco a poco lo diré

Que hace tiempo que el reloj no se paraba
Que las risas no callaban, que no entraba tanta luz
Hace tiempo que creía que no podía ser

Estoy temblando
De pensar que ya te tengo aquí a mi lado
Y prometo no soltarte de la mano
Ahora sé que hoy ya tus pasos son mis pasos
Estoy temblando, estoy temblando

Tal vez no hay manera de entenderlo
Y sabes que hoy sé que contigo puede ser

Ya ves, la distancia se hace corta
Y esta vez se fue todo aquello que no fue

Que hace tiempo que el silencio no me hablaba
Que mis labios no besaban, que no había tanto en mí
Hace tiempo que creía que no podía ser

Estoy temblando
De pensar que ya te tengo aquí a mi lado
Y prometo no soltarte de la mano
Ahora sé que hoy ya tus pasos son mis pasos
Estoy temblando
Temblando, de pensar que ya te tengo aquí a mi lado

Tanto que aprender, tanto por vivir

Promesas que llegan descalzas si no estás conmigo

Perdido entre las mil historias que me están pasando 
Se pasan los que no se atreven a vivir volando 
Y volando desperté de todo lo que había pasado 

Dime quién, me obligó a pensar que algo es para siempre 
Para qué, si siempre era nunca y nunca era el destino 
Como fue si el destino nuestro nunca lo escribimos

Mueve el mundo y con gracia le ves bailar 
Y con él el escenario de mi hogar

António Zambujo,"Não sei, não sabe ninguém
Porque canto fado, neste tom magoado
De dor e de pranto
E neste momento, todo sofrimento
Eu sinto que a alma cá dentro se acalma
Nos versos que canto
Foi Deus, que deu luz aos olhos
Perfumou as rosas, deu ouro ao sol e prata ao luar
Foi Deus que me pôs no peito
Um rosário de penas que vou desfiando e choro a cantar
E pôs as estrelas no céu
E fez o espaço sem fim
Deu luto as andorinhas
Ai deu-me esta voz a mim

Se canto, não sei porque canto
Misto de ternura, saudade, ventura e talvez de amor
Mas sei que cantando
Sinto o mesmo quando, se tem um desgosto
E o pranto no rosto nos deixa melhor
Foi Deus, que deu voz ao vento
Luz ao firmamento
E deu o azul nas ondas do mar
Ai foi Deus, que me pôs no peito
Um rosário de penas que vou desfiando e choro a cantar
Fez o poeta o rouxinol

Keitä kadulla tapaan iltaisin
Kuka vastaa, keneltä kysyisin?
Milloin perille pääsisin?
Minne teen kodin
Sieltä en tahtoisi en takaisin

Tahdon askeleistani jättää jälkiä
Enemmän ehtiä nauraa kuin itkeä
Ja sitoa yhteen niitä onnen nauhoja
Pidemmäksi kuin osiensa summa

					Words and Music by Margo Guryan


You make me shine,
     shine, shine, shine
Looking at me
With stars in your eyes
Trying to say
What I've always wanted to know
You want me to know that you're mine, mine

My, it feels good to believe
In someone
It's been a long time
A lonely time
It's been a hard time
An empty time
Since anyone made me feel

Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
Dancing to music
And singing each line
As I shine, shine, shine, shine
    shine, shine, shine, shine

What joys do there abound

And ever more they spring

And ever more the saints are glad
And ever more they sing

Likewise there she does sing

I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree
I will arise and go now
And a small cabin built there, of clay and wattles made
I will arise and go now
Nine bean rows will I have there, a hive for the honey bee
I will arise and go now
And live alone in the bee-loud glade

And I shall have some peace there
For peace comes dropping slow
Dropping from the veils of the morning
To where the cricket sings
There midnight's all a-glimmer
And noon, a purple glow
And evening full of linnet's wings

I will arise
I will arise and go now, for always night and day
I will arise and go now
I hear lake water lapping
With low sounds by the shore
I will arise and go now
While I stand on the roadway or on the pavements gray
I hear it in the deep, in the deep heart's core
I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree",Innisfree

Since the lovely are sleeping, go sleep thou with them

Where thy mates of the garden lie scentless and dead

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming

There was a blessed Messiah born

Near Bethlehem did shepherds keep
Their flocks of lambs and feeding sheep
To whom God's angels did appear
Which put the shepherds in great fear
Prepare and go, the angels said
To Bethlehem, be not afraid
For there you'll find this happy morn
A princely babe, sweet Jesus born

With thankful heart and joyful mind
The shepherds went the babe to find
And as God's angels had foretold
They did our savior Christ behold
Within a manger He was laid
And by His side the virgin maid
Attending on the Lord of Life
Who came from earth to end all strife

Trying to turn me on won't happen this time

Men mount birds of prey to war
And raid each others shore
Wizards and Warlocks battle by night

A man of barbaric breed
In a blade of steel he lays his trust

From many who have gazed in his murderous eye
Astride his mount he cursed and then
Assembled his men in thousands and ten
Onward lads we'll kill them all
Victory is ours
We'll have their heads and female slaves
Soon to loot their towers
Riding hard they rushed the gates
And scaled the granite walls
Through boiling oil and falling stone

In bloody streets the battle raged
Brave men died and women were caged
Amidst the hoard, a barbaric roar

Is a problem for me
Everything they do is complete mystery
They stand around being so outspoken
They're just waiting for their hearts to be broken

If I can find one I could understand
I'm gonna kiss her feet and shake her hand
Some things are better left to the dead of night
But one thing you better learn
But one thing you better learn
But one thing you better know

Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?
Could you feel the same way too?
I wanna know

The name of the game

I have no friends, no-one to see
And I am never invited
Now I am here, talking to you
No wonder I get excited

Got a feeling, you give me no choice

Anya Marina,"Somewhere waiting for me
There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though she's far away

Anya Marina,"There was a dive bar and a cowboy
Well, not a cowboy really, but he wore the hat
And there was someone who looked like me
At least a little, but not exact

He said, ""I'm gonna take you out proper
You and me are going to the zoo.""
And I pretended that I was bored
And I could take my eyes off of you

All I had to do was ask
I never knew that this would last
I never knew what I was in for
This town thinks it's got your number
It's unlisted, but they can wonder and guess and speculate on you and me

Little did I know,
Little did I see
Little did I know just how far our little car could go
Little did I know

Said he was damaged over whiskey
A kind of Kerouac over cigarettes
""Let me guess, you're a gambler, too?""
He said, ""I bet I marry you.""

Well, I was talking like a bad-ass, too
A kind of animal all my own
""No one's ever gonna tie me down,
Especially not some Romeo.""

All I had to do was look
You were such an open book
How could I miss what I was in for?
Go on ahead and be a loner
Pur on your distant look and roam around the west
Like Jack and Neal and Dean

Little did I know

And I drove a thousand miles for you
I even bent the rules, it's true
I swear to everything above
I never knew you at all, my love",Cowboy

Tonight in LA, rapper Notorious B.I.G. was gunned down
At the media party. He was pronounced dead on arrival.
No suspects have been taken into custody.

[Radio Announcer2]
Combs' trouble seems to continue as he turned himself
In today to local police for an alleged assault and
Battery charge. He posted bail and was released on 
His own recognizance.

[Puff]
In my distress I prayed to the Lord
And the Lord answered and rescued me
The Lord is for me so I will not be afraid
What can mere mortals do to me
Yes the Lord is for me
He will help me
I will look in triumph at those who hate me
It's better to trust the Lord than to take confidence in people
It's better to trust the Lord than to have confidence in Princes
Though hostle nations surrounded me
I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord
Yes, they surrounded and attacked me
But I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord
They swarmed around me like bees
They blazed against me like roaring flames
But I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord
The Lord is my strength and my song
He has become my victory
Lord forgive them, for they know not what they do",School's Out (Forever) [Get Your Ass to Detention RMX]
Anywhen,"Now if you feel that you can't go on 
Because all of your hope is gone,
And your life is filled with much confusion 
Until happiness is just an illusion,
And your world around is crumblin' down;  
Darling, reach out (come on girl, reach on out for me) 
Reach out (reach out for me.)
I'll be there, with a love that  will shelter you.
I'll be there, with a love that will see you through.

Reach out (reach out for me.)
I'll be there, to love and comfort you, 
And I'll be there, to cherish and care for you.
I'll be there to love and comfort you.
 
I can tell the way you hang your head,
You're without love and now you're afraid
And through your tears you look around, 
But there's no peace of mind to be found.
I know what you're thinkin', 
You're alone now, no love of your own, 
But darling, reach out (come on girl, reach out for me) 
Reach out (reach out for me.)

Anywhen,"Just a few words
About my state
In the white noise of life

I might feel like listening up
But I can't meditate
With all strange circuits in my head

I'm a toy
I am just a toy
Nothing but a toy
For this brain
And it's pure pain

Just a few words
About my state
In the sleepwalk of life

I might feel like slowing down
But my feet won't wait around
With all the funny rhythms in those legs",Toy [#]
Anywhen,"She will run and hide from the nannies

It's a strange little girl, such a strange little girl

They will sing for hours
Dinah and the beautiful blue, eltting through
All the hidden powers
Dinah and the beautiful blue, with the force
Of a million lifetimes

Make me smile again

Let them search as daylight fades away

Aoife O'Donovan,"In the middle of everything I started to see
You said you were a beekeeper, but I heard no bees
I asked you where do you get your honey
You said darling I'm a beekeeper, I'm up to my knees.

Oh I'm a lonely sailor on a sinking boat
Sometimes I think I'm a mermaid but I never float
You asked me why I didn't send you a note
I threw my pen in the gutter with what I wrote.

Oh, oh, just like a dove on a bay riverside with a little black crow.
Wanna know all of the ribs on your cage.
Tell you that a part of me lives in you, and I'm a goddamn fool
Make your move or get out of the game.

At the end of the tunnel I can see the light
I promised you I wouldn't go down without a fight
I know it won't always be black and white
'Cause there are demons and things that go bump in the night.

So swallow your bitter pill
You said you were a thrill seeker but what's your thrill?
It's the way you walk, it's the way you stand still
And the way that you look at me and always will.

Hey, today's the day, are you ready to fall, are you ready to jump
From a plane with a stranger on your back
High in the sky, you look back and where am I at - I'm a man in disguise
Tongue-tied you started to crack

Started to crack and the sky's turning black
And I'm stuck in you like a thumbtack
Between my legs and my arms you're alarmed
And I won't hurt you just want to charm you.

Wanna be there, and I wanna be there
I won't let you go

I need a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)

[Verse One]
Yo, I need a gangsta bitch; she don't sleep and she don't play
Stickin up girls from around the fuckin way
Strapped but lovable, hateful but huggable
Always in trouble and definitely fuckable
See her now, booms and pounds, she's mine friend
Puffin on a blunt, sippin on a Heineken
She's got charm, a firearm to match mine
Goin to the movies packin his and her nine's
Wearin Carhart and leather, motherfuck the weather
On Valentine's Day, doin stick-ups together
No one to blame, no shame in her game
And when we fuck she makes me scream out her name
She's not petty, confidant, ready
Right for late night, we play fight with machetes
This goes out to all the gangsta hoe pros
Give me a ghetto girl, fuck a Soul Train hoe

[Chorus: Apache]
I need a gangsta bitch yo (a gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I want to ""Gangsta boogie!"" with my (gangsta bitch)

I need a (gangsta bitch) I want a (gangsta bitch)

[Verse Two]
She likes to party with her posse and drink beer
Pour a little bit out for the sisters who ain't here
She's not the one, player you might get done
Her idea of fun's takin her son shoppin for a gun
Likes to dress to impress, quick to attack
When your punk-ass boys run, you know she's got your back
In a Benz with her friends, aiyyo Jeep kid
Drivin down the street pumpin, ""Apache you ain't shit!""
Snappin on niggaz, takin no shorts
Sittin on a porch, pullin on a Newport
Minds her business, knows cause she hears things
Fat herringbone and diamond studded earrings
She's a thoroughbred, walks and talks with class
Try to get fast, she just might slap your ass
Come meet my moms, but the two might not click
Parents just don't understand..

[Chorus: Apache]
I need a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch yo (a gangsta bitch)
I want to ""Gangsta boogie!"" with my (gangsta bitch)
I need a (gangsta bitch) I want a (gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch yo (a gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I want to ""Gangsta boogie!"" with my (gangsta bitch)
I need a (gangsta bitch) I want a (gangsta bitch)

[Verse Three]
I had a church girl, quiet girl, one girl was rich
The most memorable girl was a gangsta bitch
We went out a lot, sometimes we dressed the same
Lickin shots in the park and had pet names
I called her 'Dollars' cause that's what she liked to spend
She called me 'Diamond' cause my dick was her best friend
If you owed her dough, then you had to pay
Bought her an AK for her 21st birthday
We packed up and shacked up, didn't need a job
Engaged to a criminal and married to the mob
I gave MC's injuries and beat 'em down
While she's, pickin up ki's, from Uptown
Sad to say one day got caught out there
I shed tears when the judge said five years
She's gone now so it's time to make my switch
So who'll be my next gangsta bitch?

I need a gangsta bitch, yo! (a gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I want to ""Gangsta boogie!"" with my (gangsta bitch)
I need a (gangsta bitch) I want a (gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch yo (a gangsta bitch)
I want to ""Gangsta boogie!"" with my (gangsta bitch)
I need a (gangsta bitch) I want a (gangsta bitch)

[Apache]
Yeah, yeah.. (a gangsta bitch)
This shit goes out to all the gangsta bitches Uptown (a gangsta bitch)
All the gangsta bitches in Brooklyn, Long Island (gangsta bitch)

You've got your good things, and I've got mine
In heaven this could be divine

Leaving the outside clean

Hook plays once

""I am immortal, I have inside me blood of kings
I have no rival, no man can be my equal.""

[Verse 1]
I spit, to make the mic like a flammable torch
""It's understandable"" my mind is a mechanical force
And I'm a cannibal my mandible is chewin' ya corpse
""I'm tyrannical, a vandle of intangible sorts
Not a mineral a mammal or an animal, I'm.
Metaphysical, the syllables in critical rhymes
Flows blowin' off ya limbs like invisible mines
Been invincible with rhymes since the biblical times
A warlord with a sword from the Mongul Horde
Speak the tongue of the lord, to bless my vocal chords
They tried to resurrect hip-hop, but faith is gone
So I'll take it over by force like Ghengis Khan
If you say it ain't raw, you better pray to Allah
'cause I got an arrow that'll travel straight through the jaw
Got breath control, flow like a ship with a sail
Divine when I spit, like if I sipped from the grail
'cause I'm immortal

Hook repeats twice
""I am immortal, I have inside me blood of kings
I have no rival, no man can be my equal."" IMMORTAL

[Verse 2]
I'm underground like communities of homeless bums
Sleepin' by the third rail where the A Train runs
My brain strains to lift freight trains from off the ground
When I'm walkin' around, I'm the talk of the town
'cause I harness mental powers scientists don't understand
So I'm on the low hiding from the average man
In a bad savage land I'm rockin' a gas mask
With black gats attached to snaps on back packs
To easily grip, when frequency blips
Alert me to intruders in the sewers where I secretly sit
Fine tunin' my rhymes until I got the hottest style
Then wrestle the mics from mutated crocodiles
That slipped into the pipes sometime in '88
Now they taste nuclear waste that makes 'em radiate
I'm subterranean, and melt the steel titanium

With powers of urainium comin out of my crainium. immortal

Hook repeats twice

[Verse 3]
I'll walk through Hell till it freezes
If Reverend Run sells his Addidas
I stomp cats and leave a path of skeletal pieces
Ya'll are washed up like shellfish on beaches
I'm a genius that's developed speeches deeper than telekinesis
My immortality's recorded on record
Never distorted, contorted it into 240 seconds
You pressed ya single up but nobody will hear you
Like that Puerto Rican flag CD hangin' off ya rear view
GET READY TO RUMBLE, let's get busy
I'll spin the axis backwards, make ya planet dizzy
Decapitatin' catchin' the quickening when I'm spittin
I be wettin motherfuckers like a christening and cripplin'
Ya click, quick with equipment equipped
Like bloods blast crips
My hammer never clicks, pack back up clips
Slaughter all the competition when rippin a mortal man
And cut ya heads off, like only an immortal can.

Hook repeats twice

Apathetic is immortal, I'll live forever
""Forever, forever ever, forever ever?""
One Two is immortal, I'll love forever
""Forever, forever ever, forever ever?""
Celph Titled is immortal, he'll live forever
""Forever, forever ever, forever ever?""
Open Mic is immortal, he'll live forever
""Forever, forever ever, forever ever?""",Immortal

Verse 1 (character: Jeff)
All star quarterback, varsity letter, I drive a Jetta
A popular kid, my parents give me all my cheddar
Plus I date Heather, the flyest girl in our school
I got a very large house, with an inground pool
I rock Polo and Abercrombie & Fitch, I'm rich
Pompous and arrogant, makin' fun of nerd clicks
You motherfuckin' freaks and geeks are dumb
With ya painted white face, and pierced nose and tongue
I pass my classes with ease and get an ""A""
Cheatin. 'cause if I don't pass, I don't play
I'll shove you in ya locker and I'll get in ya face
Put you in ya place, 'cause you fuckin nerds are a waste of air
Black clothes, blank stare, died hair
You could die tomorrow and nobody would care
I'll push on the floor when all the halls are crowded
But you're just a wimp, whatcha gonna do about it?

[Hook]
No more homework, no more books
No more teachers dirty looks
No more detentions no more ""F's""
No breath inside your chest.
No more homework, no more books
No more teachers dirty looks
No unpopular, no more cool
No more. school

Verse 2 (character: girl)
Four years of high school, I can't believe its here
My senior year, waitin for the crowd to cheer, at graduation
I haven't decided my occupation, but my major in college is gonna be
communications
I'm nice to everybody in school, whether cool, or uncool. I'm neutral
An outstanding pupil like my teachers say
I never missed a single day
Always on the honor roll, never less than an ""A""
I help jocks with their grades, even that jerk Jeff
Who's an ass, but never woulda passed class with an ""F""
Kids he picks on are smarter then him, and smaller than him
Never larger or taller than him
But this one kid, named Jay.
That jeff calls gay, and beats up, doesn't look very normal today
So I give a little smile and he gives one back
Then he walks by and reaches into his napsack
I feel like I want to run, but my whole body's stunned
I can't believe it, but Jay's got a ..

[Hook]

Verse 3 (character: Jay)
My name is Jason, a real big fan of death
I sit back thinkin' of Jeff and I take a deep breath
How'd I'd love to fire 30 slugs into his chest, till nothin' is left
I'm always frustrated with stress, I want respect
Back when I was 6 I'd dissect insects, and spray house pets with Windex
I'm Beelzebub on drugs
The intellect of a David Berkowitz, roamin' on the internet
I'm sick of gettin pushed around bein' clowned
When I'm the most powerful evil being in town
I wake up at 5:30 and stare into space
Walk into my parents room and shoot 'em both in the face
Take a shower get dressed load my weapon for school
Walk through the hall, step over the large blood pool
On the bus with a semi-automatic in knapsack
Smile on my face, as I sit in the back
Then I step into the building and I almost feel invincible
Wave to the nurse, say hi to the principal
Walk to to my locker, everything seems slow
Then I Jeff. and here we go
Weapons out the bag, people stop speakin', girls shreikin'
I start shootin' rounds till Jeff's chest is bleedin'
His head explodes then I start to reload
Nobody can hurt me now. 'cause I'm in murder mode
Fire at everybody that's directly in my sight
But layin' on the ground on the somebody is I like
This girl who I've known who's always nice and talks to me
Crawls to me, coughin' up blood and awkwardly
Whispers two words right before her head drops
She opened her mouth and said. ""please. stop""
I could never begin to describe the way I felt
I dropped to my knees, turned the gun on myself
And pulled the trigger.

Hey yeah ay ya ya

You better know now or know how
We so foul and profound
Blowouts, CD's sold out, the illest no doubt
When ""Celph Titled"" roll out, immaculate respect

""Uzi's"" and ""Tek's"" protect your neck with a teflon turtleneck
Bitch there ain't a diesel cat that could face me
You don't really want to run your mouth and make me
Summon the gods with my mystery chant

And perform the running-man for my victory dance
Murder motherfuckers mostly over money with guns to they tummies
Hollow-tips that leave you stiffer than a mannequin dummy
Record a demo while the ""Demigodz"" make new songs

Your better off running the triathlon with parachutes on
A real bug-nigga, and that's how I'm better known
You make beats, I'd rather rhyme to a metronome
Other crews got ego's but can't floss right
I'll run them over have em' smoking the exhaust pipe

Well well well well well well
Hey yeah ay ya ya

Already proved that all my rhymes are wicked enough
They sleep when you on the mic your fucking ""Jigglypuff""
A big kid jail-fuck, I don't want to grow up
And I don't care what he says yo he can suck a know what

I'm bigger than that, smile when you kicking my raps
Have conversations with your girl while she sits on my lap
Yo stop talking about they girls man it's starting to get old
Well, um, no tell they girls to stop leaving they clothes

The reason I flow, is not to just get us indoors
Pops in barber shops like my son is better than yours
'Cause and effect, ""Rise"" is the effect and the cause
All those who came before I just perfected they flaws

Perfect with clause I have to be look at my town
Neglecting the laws of gravity, I'm not coming down
There's cops on the ground, that look like dots on a map
From the level of where I'm at when I'm dropping, you whack

Well well well well well well
Hey yeah ay ya ya

I rock rhymes that blow ends, drop lines like gold friends
Pull dimes that start trends, while your trying to make amends
Your girls be like you want it, all fives and no tens
Actually the wrong one, you bust with small guns

I look like an MC who murders the spot
Like ""Derek Jeter"" looks like a smaller version of ""The Rock""
Bitch please, I never ever met a dick-tease
I'm so cool that when I spit free's my spit freeze

""Old Yeller"", I'm known to leave a fella
With more cuts and scratches than the ""Shook One's"" acapella
You want to fuck around with ""Esoteric""
And blown on some bullshit like working-dice-credit

When rappers try, they usually step and die
Then MC's get the message like a number I don't recognize
Your call her back, pop minds they hear me freestyle
And spend the next seven days hittin' redial

Well well well well well well
Hey yeah ay ya ya

I keep the planet under my spell, under my reign
I stay on tracks, while throwing rappers under the train
I'm numbing your brain, stunning you while tonguing your dame
I appreciate her, everything that's under her brain

When reciting it's lighting with thunder and rain
A ""Demigod"" that's beyond your small blundering brains
Fortunate fame, really it's just one in the same
That I obtain while your still a bum begging for change

Trying to front like your new and really nothing has changed
You ain't underground, your locked in a dungeon with chains
Your not a thug 'cause' you rock your little ""Lugz"" and a chain
I'm a slug, nah fuck that, I'm double the pain

Your hussling game is lame, couple bucks and a name
Maybe some buckets of champagne with sluts in the range
I'll fuck with your brain and flex so your muscles are strained
Until your nothing but a punk clutching crutches and canes

Do you respect your brother's woman friend
And share with black folks, not of kin

And love for our nation, would make a better society

Than to bring about a little trust
But we shall overcome our beliefs someday

And how long have you hated your white teacher
Who told you, you love your black preacher
Can you respect your brother's woman friend

Die Kleider vom Leib. Wir rollen durch den Sand wie zwei

Wir tanzen und knutschen die ganze Nacht, ich verrenkter

Still, I wish you could feel just how I feel for you
If you could someday

Take a second look, they're gone
Your plans have changed
Your dreams have faded

Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

Would you drown on purpose or try to survive?

When your moms come home off the midnight shift
She turned around heard the shotgun click

Until I started getting beatings everyday
Sometimes for going outside to play
Late at night on my knees I'd pray
A young child, wishing the pain would go away

Beat with belts like a slave with a whip
Kicked me down steps outside in the snow
Punched me in the chest stomped me out on the flo'

Apologetix,"I know a scene you ought to see
I read it in Luke 16
So let me be I wanna set the scene
A wealthy dude his name's unknown inside his sprawling home
Stuffing his mouth with that life of ease
While Lazarus is thin and weak, down the driveway on the street
I don't think he will survive
If he could get that nameless dude to feed him some leftover food
He'd take the crumbs now as they'd fall, if they would fall (Fall)

Lifestyles of the rich and the nameless
The solid gold bracelets don't make you blameless
His money is not the problem
He forgot Lazarus; Think Jesus saw them

Did you know the rich and nameless dude eventually died
And when he woke up things were on the fiery side
With Lazarus across the chasm and Abraham talked to him
He said, â??You know it's really hot in here, my throat is cracked
Send Lazarus to me, O Father Abraham
He can always just run some water down to meâ??
â??I'd like to help you get a drink,â?? Abraham said, â??Honestly,
I don't think that would suffice
But he's already paid his dues
Now he is somewhere else than you
You think that's someone else's fault? Maybe notâ??

Lifestyles of the rich and the nameless
They're always so shameless
God plays no favorites
It's funny yet such a shocker
How he demanded, â??Bring me some water!â??

Lifestyles of the rich and the nameless
The one with no status God made so famous
It's funny to watch the process
Because somebody prosperous He made anonymous

Doin' a sailor's dance
Far below the clock towers height
I fell into her hands
She said, I've got perfect vergency,(?)

I thought you were a quicker study still

Can't explain the source of sour poise (?) comin' on through me

Let the horses all starve in a ditch
Let the architects sit and get rich
Let the Christians call down from above
Let them starve for wanting of love and

When nothing ever seems to go your way
And no matter how hard you try,
You couldn't chase the blues away.

Remember when you told me there'd be days,
When all the skies would turn to gray.
You said you'd always be there for me all the way

I didn't think I needed you to help me through,
Didn't have a clue
I never took one step alone,
But now I know you'd do what only you can do.

When I'm barely getting by,
All I need is to see you smile.
Don't got to read between the lines cause you're real with me, you're real with me.
Even on my darkest days, 
I know it's gonna be okay.
'Cause I know you're gonna always stay, stay real with me

I know I can always count on you, whenever I need to hear the truth.
'Cause even if it hurts, you say the words you need to say.
Now that I know what you do for me, I don't know how to say how much it means.
That you don't want no pay, you're being my friend unconditionally.

You gave me all that you could give, show me how to love, how to live.
And though you tell me its okay, I don't have to say,
I wanna thank you anyway.

Maybe I don't tell you enough, but I'm here to stay.
I need you so damn much.
And if ever you find you're in despair.
Just like you're there for me, I'll be there. I'll be there.

Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

Oh oui, regardes toi

April March,"The girls in their knee socks
They all got it made
Just walking and whistling
In the sun, in the shade
They haven't been shown yet
How love can behave
They're happy-go-lucky
Like bears in a cave

The boats in the harbor
They're never alone

The sea licks them all day
And makes them her own
They don't think of salt rot
Or even decay
They bob in the rough tide
Like children at play",Knee Socks
April Phillips,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

Who know where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way
All the way",All the Way
April Phillips,"It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.
For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults, I love you still,
It had to be you, wonderful you,
It had to be you.

It had to be you, it had to be you.

Could make me be true, could make me be blue,

April Phillips,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon

Retreating from the life, which you live
Days ago it made me sad to think that everything wouldn't be ok 
And to know that we would break away! 

They told me not to let you go away! 
So, here I am
They told me that the feelings wouldn't go away
So, here I am 

Here I am... 
Here I am... 

Well, let's start this over
'Cause it sickens me that I'm the only one, who was thinking how it would be
I know that this is how we want to be, so innocent in all the things 
And start to live inside again! 

They told me not to let you go away! 
So, here I am
They told me that the feelings wouldn't go away
So, here I am

Here I am... 
Here I am... 

Your life of solitude, why don't you give it up? 
And take away all the messed up fear you hold within 
Don't wanna be the same
You know you make me sick
Yea, I'm your only son who ever cared which way you went? 

Your life of solitude, why don't you give it up? 
And take away all the messed up fear you hold within. 
You'll wanna be the same, you'll never be the same, I'll never be the same

They told me that the feelings wouldn't go away

I said you're trying to kill the pain
You said before, ""All I wanted was a friend""
Well, you never come in the sunlight cause the shadows are by
You are slowly dying from inside

You've been running from them way too long
Well, nothing matters in the end
Take their laughter as a grain of sand
'Cause nothing matters in the end
But you'll break away, into suicide

Take a backseat into the wind
Take the pills, they'll cure the pain
You will never live again, well never like before
TRUST ME, GET OUTSIDE, you'll see the beautiful life you'll leave
The only problem is, you'll burn for sure

[Chorus]
You've been running from them way too long
Well, nothing matters in the end.
Take their laughter as a grain of sand
'cause nothing matters in the end

And you'll run away, into suicide

Will you get to dream?
Will you get to breathe some day?
Well, I have felt the same before
You will heal again!

I'm sayin the facts 
I came back with some sicka stones

Like havin' a asthma attack 
When they see the plasma in back 
You dudes are wheezin' behind me 
My flow is like a coupe, breezin at 90 
That's the reason they signed me 
It's quick metaphors and hard punches on the cuts 
Feels somethin' like hard punches to the gut 
How I address the haters and under estimaters 
And ride up on them like they escalators 
They shook up and hooked up to respirators 
On they last breath talking to investigators 
I'm a breath of fresh air

Of a sunny morning, sunshine and dew

And help us find the love you know we need

In the evening, the wind can set you free 
There's a faith that grew, and stayed with me

It's those summer nights that I spent with you 
Can you hear the water splashing

We stood there laughing, like a child who loves to run 
And it's just begun, it's just begun, to set us free

Not so long ago, when I was just a child
I never realized the way I felt inside
And how much you meant to me
How much you meant to me
And I don't think I've ever told you so
And I thought you'd like to know
That now I see and I can understand
I understand

I was unkind, I must have been blind to your sorrow
And night after night, trying to live with your sorrow
And I was a bastard and I was wrong
And I was lost in things I've done
And I was stealing just for fun
And it was breaking your heart

I was unkind, I must've been blind to your sorrow
Night after night, tryin' to live with your sorrow
I was unsure, and lookin' for more, I was anxious
To be on my own, livin' at home I was restless

And I was lost in the things I'd done
And I was stealin' for fun
And it was breakin' your heart

They ask the spirit world

It seems like a silly thing I said
Seems like a silly thing I've done
But I was lost and all alone, completely alone
I couldn't take it anymore

And like a dream you came to me
And when no one else can see
You help me understand
Took me gently by the hand
Marjorie, your memory, is living, loving, everyday
But no one's strong when love goes wrong
It's over, if no one wants to stay
And I really feel I have to get away, get away

And yes it's sad to be alone
Gettin' drunk and gettin' stoned
First the whiskey, then the wine
Till I was losin' my mind
I couldn't take it anymore

And like a dream you came to me, oh

But I don't know, I don't ride no more

Those painted women that I adore

Where men are mean and the children are sore

You're so bad, you're the devil's door

Cause you're so bad (so bad)
Woman you make a fool out of me, yes you do

Response is just a motion
The pressure never ends baby
I hope it don't drive me crazy

It's so tough (so tough), there's nothin' left to try

Because you're too hot to handle

They told me all about you, that I'd better watch my step
I've had a lot of girlfriends, but no one like you yet
I wanna be the only one, you say that you want the same
But you're much too restless for me girl, I'm tired of playin' games

Seemingly related, it's complicated
It's understood now, it's up to me now
Everybody knows that it's over, you
Everybody knows that it's gonna break my heart in two

(without your love) without your love, it's wrong
(without your love) without you, I'm not that strong
(without your love) I got nothin' at all
It's such a long, long way to go, without your love

Needing you, needing anyone as much as I need you
Takin' the truth, takin' nothin' for granted
Reaching out in all directions, I'll have you to stay
Waiting for an invitation, to steal your heart away

It's such a long, long way to go, without your love

Seems now that I've mistaken you
Seems like now I could be losing you
What I feel, it's all illusion
What you feel, it's so confusing
So unreal that I'm still tryin' to steal your heart away

And there's no lies about tomorrow or yesterday
There's no place for being wrong in what we say

And there's nothin' in our way

With thoughts that words could never say

And with no strings attached our motives clear
You can feel the tension in the air

And we're not sayin' that it's right this time
We're just takin' it and feelin' fine

And that's all it ever will be

Night could bring

To drive a man insane

You play the same old games
You could always make it easy
But there was no way out
If you want, just say that you're sorry
But there's nothing you can do without

So give a little and take a little for nothing
Show a little and make it something exciting

I've been standing in one place too long
Listening to that same old song
And you know, baby I gotta go, yeah

Bright lights, comin' up real fast
All night, I gotta make this moment last
Headlights, pullin' up beside me
A man pulled me over, gets out of his car
And he said, you better slow down

Busy pumpin' of the feet
Bodies movin' in the heat all night, and that's alright
I'm lookin' at the way she moves
Cookin' up and turnin' grooves
As she does, could this be love

Bright lights, she's comin' up real close
All night, I gotta make the most of it
So nice, she's rubbin' up beside me
Then she pulls back a little, looks to me in the eye
To say, you better slow down

Drinkin' wine and movin' fast
I don't know if I'm gonna last the night, and that ain't right

Asked me if I want a toke
Hey what's this baby, you know that ain't right

All night, I'm goin' up and down
So I, stop right here, ain't botherin' me

No one can say, that crime doesn't pay, that never is true
It's supply and demand, with blood on your hands, nighmares come true
It's in all the headlines, you're the worst of a kind, a sinister breed
Such a contemptable way, to have your own say, you're poisoned with greed

I said oh no (no no no no), you're completely insane
I said oh no (no no no no no), you'd take a life for material gain
Blood money, you got blood on your hands
Blood money, but still you make your demands
Blood money, you can't get any colder
Blood money, but still you're thinkin' it over

You don't have to be smart, it don't take any heart, least of all, shame
Some turret stunt, open in the front, your motive is plain
And for those that contend, with the choice to condemn, I know that you care
For those left alone, when it's time to go home, and nobody's there

I said oh no (no no no no), you're completely insane
I said oh no (no no no no no), you'd take a life for material gain
Blood money, you got blood on your hands
Blood money, but still you make your demands
Blood money, you can't get any colder
Blood money, but still you're thinkin' it over

When you're out on the street, and you got nothin' to eat, it's easy to see
That you do what you can, still I don't understand, how wrong you can be
Though it's all very clear, that you bargain with fear, there's no justice at all
It's easy for some, they say the bigger they come, the harder they fall

I said oh no (no no no no), you're completely insane
I said oh no (no no no no), you'd take a life for material gain
Blood money, you got blood on your hands
Blood money, but still you make your demands
Blood money, you can't get any colder
Blood money, but still you're thinkin' it over

They call it the burnout factor, and only the good die young
Somebody's gonna take their life, just tryin' to have some fun
The paper's gonna say we're crazy, no matter what they say, yeah
You know I'm gonna rock all night, gonna rock all night and day

Whenever they quote you man, you'll be misunderstood
They're never gonna get it right, or tell it the way they should
Maybe we move too fast to put it all in a song
And if we keep pushin' ourselves we won't be around too long
If you wanna try it

Crash and burn, crash and burn
Crash and burn, crash and burn all night long

Some people like to take it easy and flow without a sound
Others like to play for keeps and spread themselves around
I don't wanna say it's right, but if that's where you wanna be
Life's too short to miss out on what you wanna see
If you wanna try it

Crash and burn, crash and burn
Crash and burn, crash and burn all night long

Come on now, honey, don't tell me the way I ought to be
You know I don't need nobody talkin' back to me
Hey, I'm gonna live my life the way I think I should
You know I wouldn't change a thing, even if I could
I tell it like it is

Or end up in a gallery, of faces with no names

Well the first thing I remember, was the way she smiled
And the way she looked at me, drivin' me wild
She was dressed to kill in her five inch heels, her painted on satin pants
She had the look of need, like, give it to me, I dedided I should take a chance

If you see kay, tell her I want her
If you see kay, tell her I need her
If you see kay, tell her I want her now

Her legs were long shapely, I could see her love was hot
And when it came together, she'd give you all she's got
She had the walk of a woman on fire, her eyes undressed my mind and soul
I woulda gladly bet my last ten buck, in love she'd lose control

If you see kay, tell her I want her
If you see kay, tell her I need her
If you see kay, tell her I want her now

I had her in my dreams, three times every night
Her love was so complete, her love was warm and right
When I wake up in the morning, with this achin' in my heart
You can bet the need I'm feelin', is only just a start
I felt the pressure risin', when I looked where she had been
By the time I gave up hope, she'd probably fall in love again

A prima donna or a debutante, you say
A first offender, you had your chance, and you threw it away
So why don't you just get on your pony
And ride out somewhere where you can be lonely
All by yourself, instead of tellin' me

Here we are, and we never get very far
Things are never as you say they are
And you'd rather be somewhere else in time
Anywhere, well you don't mind

The legal tender was the motive for your shame
You knew the truth, but never took the blame, you knew it was wrong
But never one to open your heart
You held it inside till it tore you apart
And you couldn't go on, and now you're tellin' me

Here we are, and we never get very far
Things are never as you say they are
And you'd rather be somewhere else in time
Anywhere, well you don't mind
Waiting on a miracle, waiting on a miracle
Waiting on a miracle, wasting all your time

Under pressure till it got the best of you
False images, silhouettes, the old and the new
Nothing ventured, there's nothing gained
You take your chance, it may never come again
Then throw it away, and don't go tellin' me

Someone's been hurt by a love that's gone wrong

Just between you and me
Baby I know our love will be
Just between you and me
Always I know our love will be
Just between you,
Just between you and me

Words are sometimes hard to find
The silence can be so unkind
You always help me find my way
The love that we share grows stronger each day

Just between you and me
Baby I know our love will be
Just between you and me
Always I know our love will be
Seulement entre toi et moi
Means that our love will always be
Just between you and me
Baby I know our love will be
Just between you,
Just between you and me

So many times I've loved you
And now I don't even know you
I'm just a victim for your love
And having my whole world fall down
And finding the strength to go on
Cause I'm just a victim for your love
And I'm not the one you're thinkin' of
I'm just a victim for your love

I thought our love was growin' strong
Growing each day, well I was wrong
Then having my whole world fall down
And finding the strength to go on
Cause I'm just a victim for your love
And I'm not the one you're thinkin' of
I'm just a victim for your love
And I'm not the one you're thinkin' of, no

I'm just a man with a broken heart, oh no
I'm just a man with no place to start, oh yeah

Don't break my heart, don't cause me pain
Comfort me love, hold back the rain, oh no
I'm just a man with a broken heart, oh no

Waiting for sun to be risen

I'll build you a paradise with these two hands. 
The top of your skin, makes my body go numb, 
I'm thinking to myself, if my dream come true, 
Or is it 'cause you never give me a chance to tell you 
How I feel, the moments we had were too precious to kill. 

When it is cloudy or windy, 
Please turn your face at me

Aqua,"Aquarius, was born the night
The shining stars, needed brighter shining light
Aquarius, was my savior
It came along, like a blast from out of sight

When I was weak, you came along
Enlightened me, covered the sun
You seduced me, I can never ever run

'Cause I, can only lose
When I'm, Aquarius
You're the power that I need
To make it all succeed, can you hear me call?

Aquarius, is the stardust
It kills the faith, and the only one I trust
It calls your name, and you listen
It steals your soul, and your hunger and your lust

For life, and being free (it's killing me, it's killing me)
It's dragging you, it's killing me (it's killing me, it's killing me)
You seduced me, I can never ever run

'Cause I, can only lose
When I'm, Aquarius
You're the power that I need
To make it all succeed, can you hear me call? Can you hear me call?

I wish the stars would turn you in, and leave me standing in the wind
I wish the devil gave you up, and all the snow would melt and stop

This is it, I can't run away
You're controlling my life, and I can hear me say

'Cause I, can only lose
When I'm, Aquarius

Aqua,"Howdy people? 
Here's a little story about an old friend of mine 
And to all you great folks out there 
This is hardcore 10-4 

Freaky Friday, things ain't going my way 
Everything is gone, my life is a country song 
Oh oh, 

I jumped out of my bed this morning 
Then I heard this crunchy sound 
From my left leg that was broken 
And a note was laying on the ground 

Baby, I'm leaving you this minute 
Took the car and the cats and dogs 
Got the boots and the rhinestone stetson 
Nothing's left but the note you got, ah you suck 

[Chorus]
Freaky Friday, things ain't going my way 
Everything is gone, my life is a country song 
Freaky Friday, go play on the highway 
Everything is wrong, what the heck is going on 

On my way through crosstown traffic 
I was hit by a giant truck 
I came late to work and got fired 
Then suddenly the thunder struck 
Oh oh 

Baby, I am leaving you this minute 
Took the car and the cats and dogs 
Got the boots and the rhinestone stetson 
Nothing's left but the note you got, ah you suck

Life's a country song, hardcore 10-4 
What the heck is wrong, yi-ha

Everything is gone, my life is a country song

Give me time to reason, 
give me time to think it through 
Passing through the season, 
where I cheated you 
I will always have a cross to wear, 
but the bolt reminds me I was there 
So give me strength, 
to face this test tonight 
If only I could turn back time, 
If only I had said what I still hide 
If only I could turn back time, 
I would stay for the night... for the night 
Claim your right to science, 
Claim your right to see the truth 
Though my pangs of conscience, 
Will drill a hole in you 
I've seen it coming like a thief in the night, 
I've seen it coming from the flesh of your light 
So give me strength, 
to face this test tonight 
If only I could turn back time, 
if only I had said what I still hide 
if only I could turn back time, 
I would stay.

Maybe that's your way of breaking up the silence

Reach for a hand to hold
Any wonder we need to find
A certain something certain

Turn out the light and what are you left with
Open up my hands and find out they're empty
Press my face to the ground , I've got to find a reason
Just scratching around for something to believe in
Something to believe in

You have too much
And spending all your time collecting and discovering
It's not enough and no matter how you try
You'll never find the one you want

Running out of chances, oh, I'm running out of time
All my life, all my love is there
Wish that love, love was all it took to get me home

All I needs a moments grace
So I just got to see your face, that's all
Pull my head between my knees
The earth might crack, the sky might freeze
That's all I'm asking for, just let me go

One way or the other, I will feel your touch again
I got disconnected but I still heard everything

And my last lover's playing with a new man now. It's only three weeks we've been apart. They sat together and he sent her flowers. Well he can fucking keep that fickle disco tart.

My mum wanted me home early so I said I'd better go home. 
His sister said she was going anyway so she could walk me some of the way. 
And she knew a shortcut through the woods. 
She had long black hair, green eyes. 
I wish my friends could have seen me. 
We seemed to get on well on the way, considering the age gap. 
She was nineteen and I was almost fifteen.

She stopped by the river, And asked me to go swimming. 
I was a bit embarrased. I said no. 
But she said she would anyway, stepped back, and stripped. 
The sun was beginning to set, as she slipped into the water. 
And when she was in she kept teasing me, so I gave in. 
But I kept my pants on. The water was warmer than I'd expected. 
We swam around and played. She would push me under the water. 
I could feel her legs against mine underneath. 
She'd hold my arm. We must've been in about an hour.

I got out first. 
I leaned against a tree and put my trousers back on 
And then she got out of the river and walked towards me. 
She put her hands on the tree above my head and 
Pushed herself against me, and leaned down and kissed me. 
I don't know how long it lasted. 
then she stepped back and bundled up her clothes and said 
""I'm sure you can find your own way from here"". 
I ran back along the path. I was late home and I gave my mum some excuse. 
She believed it. Then the next day at school when
My friend invited me round for dinner again I said 'No'.",Deeper

But there's still some things that I don't want to hear.

Arab Strap,"So that was the first big weekend of the summer... Starts Thursday as usual with a canteen quiz and again no-one wins the big cash prize. Later I do my sound bloke routine by approaching Gina's new boyfriend to say that he shouldn't feel that there's any animosity between us and then I even go and make peace with her. I shouldn't have bothered. Then on Friday night we went through to the Arches...

There was only one car going, so some of us had to get the train. We got through quite late. Then we went to a pub to take the gear. There was no problems getting in - we saw some others waiting down the front of the queue so we skipped in. It was a good night, everyone was nutted and I ended up dancing with some blonde girl. I thought she had been quite pretty until last night when Matthew informed me that she had, in fact, been a pig. When the club finished we wandered the streets for a while until we got to this 24-hour cafe but I didn't like the look of it so we left and got a taxi back to Morag's flat. I couldn't sleep, so I sat about drinking someone else's strawberry tonic wine and tried to keep everyone else up.

Then at ten o'clock in the morning we went downstairs to buy some drink. We had intended to watch the football in the afternoon but we'd passed out by then and slept right through it, awaking to find that England had won two-nil. Then we went to get the train home and had a few in the Station bar. We had some stuff left from the previous night's supplies so when we got home we decided to go down to John's indie disco. Same story as Friday - lots of hugging, lots of dancing etc. etc. I couldn't sleep again so went up the park to look at the tomb, taking a detour through the playpark. To get in we had to climb over a ten foot steel fence, which resulted in severe bruising of our hands, legs and groins, but we had a good laugh on the stuff, especially the tube-slide, which probably doubles up as a urinal for drunk teens. Then we walked through the woods to have a look at the tomb. It was a big disappointment, but the mist on the lake was cool.

Sunday afternoon we go up to John's with a lot of beer in time to watch the Simpsons. It was a really good episode about love always ending in tragedy except, of course, for Marge and Homer. It was quite moving at the end and to tell you the truth my eyes were a bit damp. Then we watched these young girls in swimsuits have a water fight in the street. ""Taping this, aye?"" We went up to the pub about ten. It was busy for a Sunday night, lots of people we know, including my first ever girlfriend who I still find very attractive, quite frankly, but I didn't really speak to her. She's probably still a bitch, anyway. Her friend Gillian was there, I had a chat with her, she was still quite pleasant. At the same time I watched Malcolm make some terrible attempt to try and chat up a girl we know called Jo. He made some remark about her skirt that was barely there the previous night or something.

But sometimes I envy my friends, sometimes I see a world of opportunity
And what if it stays out there anchored in the middle of nowhere
Maybe we should arrange to meet somewhere
You go out with yours, I'll go out with mine

You always thought the first time was on the boat
And you don't even like boats
When we got one on holiday all you could say was don't go out too far

The only benefit of drinking
The downside of what we take

Like I could always be awake

Have we ever met the host?
Just smile and keep talking
And get your can for a toast

But this is where we reign
Pull it tight to protect us

I've tried and tried to talk, but talking's never been your style

You say you think we'll still be friends, but we both know that we won't
And your mates all laugh and smile as if they know something I don't
And every night a taxi softly sneaks you up our street
You used to say you'd broke your phone, now you don't care if you're discreet

So why won't you just tell me who was there
There's a buzz about you now, there's something funny in the air

If there's no hope for us then there's no hope for anyone
What chance can they have, if even you and me just can't have fun
Was it so long ago our friends said we were disgraceful
But how could they ever know that we could be so unfaithful

You weren't wearing much of note
just hold-ups and your long grey coat
The electric fire lit up our skin as we whispered
cause your mum was in
And mind we went to use the phone
And let the pervert see how he could only hope to be

But that was in the haze of new romance
When we floated hand in hand right through its vague, deceitful trance

If there's no hope for us then there's no hope for anyone
What chance can they have, if even you and me just can't have fun
Was it so long ago our friends said we were disgraceful
How could they have ever known that we could be so unfaithful

That's me then, I'm all packed, you know I need some time to think
You just take what you think you'll need, I think we both might need a drink
And all the secrets that I keep, you know I keep because I care
But now there's no hope left for us, well darling let's just leave it there",(If There's) No Hope for Us
Arab Strap,"If we're having so much fun then why am I crying every Monday?
Is it just to cancel out the laughter from Thursday through to Sunday?
I spend the next two days in my bed and wonder what its all about.
And as soon as I feel ok I know it's time to go back out.

I've had the same look on my face for the past two lonely years.
24 months of bargain pills and cheeky lines and stolen beers.
In all the pictures that I took my eyes are so black and wide
That you don't have to look too hard to see there's not much life inside

A new home to hang my heart is what I thought I'd never find.
Fate has always intervened and now I've got a girl in mind.
And I'm meeting her next week when we get back to Glasgow.
That's if we ever make it and don't get buried in the Dutch snow.

And if my instincts are right I will fall in love and then
Have a laugh from time to time and you'll never see me there again.

When I get home in the morning Trisha's hosting a debate.
She says if you don't like the fish you're catching you've got to change the bait.","Chat in Amsterdam, Winter 2003"
Arab Strap,"I used to be so proud of thinking I was such a liar
In the covert world of romance, brother, I was just a try-er
Woman was the enemy and victory the point
Where I'd successfully knocked someone's heart out of joint

And it's hilarious to think I thought by now I'd have a wife
But I've always been so desperate to give away my life
Then I just get lazy, I've got everything assumed
Sometimes there's nothing sexier than knowing that you're doomed

And I bed you got a fright
When you took that girl to bed
It was only your first night
When she grabbed your head and said,
""Look at me. Hey, look at me
You don't love me, I can see.
You just want me for some fun
I might as well be anyone.""

I hope you'll reap the benefits of our ten years apart
But when I tell you not to give a fuck, don't take it to heart
Try and be a gentleman and always tell the truth
I'm not just a hypocrite, I'm jealous of your youth

And I can't give you a lecture on how to be a man
I've not much advice to offer, no solid, foolproof plan
But even though you're certain that it's just a bit of fun
You'll soon get sick of microwaving low-fat meals for one

So when you ignore her call
And you just delete her text
It might make you feel tall
As you make room for the next
But look at me, hey, look at me
You know I love you, obviously
And I don't want to spoil your fun
But you don't have to hurt someone.",Confessions of a Big Brother
Arab Strap,"You know I've felt like this before,
I know you have felt it too,
But maybe I don't want to dance,
'cause I've not had as much as you.

Our lives did not begin,
The very moment that we met.
I don't want to hold your hand,
There is so much that I'll forget.

You're no angel from above,
You're the last girl I will love.

And maybe I'm not very vocal,
'cause I've used it once before,
And the more they were repeated,
The more they were ignored.

But the ears my whispers fell on,
They weren't deaf, they were bang on,
Cause they knew I didn't mean it.
I just wanted to hang on.

But the world has changed, and how!
And I know I mean it.
So let's toast the last romance,
But just don't ask me to dance.



",Don't Ask Me to Dance
Arab Strap,"Give me your gibberish tonight and talk to me with your eyes shut
Make me giggle in your sleep, and I can dream that you're a slut
And when I wake up stiff, please just feel free to use me
Then go to work and let me wonder what it was that made you choose me

And now I love you more than that, and now I love you more than this
So just stay over on your side, and go to sleep and dream of piss
Tomorrow you can tell me all the things you've done with boys
Blushing as you recount tales to satisfy my see-through ploys

'Cause in my nightly dramas, you are still the biggest star
So keep the window open and I can dream we are in the car
And tonight we will be leaving, we can take the scenic route
To a windfarm by the sea while I'm dreaming that you're mute

There's no better journey than me on my way to you
Sitting there all smug, knowing what we might get up to
And one day we'll be idle, and we'll both be past our peak
So until then, all we can do is master a technique
Now let's sleep",Dream Sequence
Arab Strap,"Burn these sheets that we've just fucked in
My weekend beacon, I've been sucked in
Just one more time and then you'll get tucked in
I think you may still be my best

Come with me 'cause I need a thrill now
It's okay 'cause I'm on the pill now

We hardly spoke we just stood around looming
Then we slipped away while the party was booming
We've got so good now at just presuming
Why won't you let me rest?

Come with me now no-one will miss you
Do what you want, don't expect me to kiss you

It's your skin and your breath and your sweat and greasy hair
The empty cans and makeshift ashtrays everywhere
Strangers waking up in the Monday morning stink
Of course I feel sick, but it's not why you think

Come with me but this is the last time
Understand you're no more than a pastime

My sharp exit could not have been quicker
But my excuse could have been a bit slicker
Just be polite now and get down and lick her
I think it's time we both get dressed",Stink
Arab Strap,"Not everything must end
Not every romance must descend
Not every lover's pact decays
Not every sad mistake replays

If you can love my growing gut
My rotten teeth and greying hair
Then I can guarantee I'll do
The same as long as you can bear
If you love my little poofy hands
My skinny arms and reeking feet
The way I dance, the way I eat
If you love the morning spots I try
And squeeze before you're up to see
Each torn ankle, each weak knee

But still my moods must swing
To solitude I must still cling
And you won't love me every day
And suffer many a display

But plates may smash and doors may slam
My comments may be less than kind
But that won't mean I've changed my mind
I'm a huffy prick the best of times
I love to sulf and shout and squeal
But please don't doubt the way I feel
Cause when the Sun burns up the earth
Our progeny will raise a can
Here's to where it all began
And every day I hear the world
Is cracking up, the end is near
I hear we all should live in fear

Bullies, burglers, paedophiles
Bird flu and passive smoke 
(They're coming!)
Volcanoes, earthquakes, tidal waves
Heart disease and strokes
(They're coming!)
Terrorists with homemade bombs
And factions everywhere
(They're coming!)
They're drinking in the street 
And they could steal your home 
And I don't care!",There Is No Ending

Me quema, por estar sin ti
Y cada día se leja la ilusión
Se aleje por vivir sin ti

Casi recordé como es vivir
Casi te he arrancado para
Siempre de mi corazón

Casi no me duele al admitir
Que aprendí muy bien como mentir
Pues casi no es bastante
Y la verdad como me duele
Casi morir sin ti

Ya casi logro convencer
A mis amigos que estoy bien
Ya casi duermo suficiente

Y acaso olvido que tú y yo
Quien hizo que todo acabo
Ya casi logro convencerme
Que ya no me hace daño

Tanto daño, que no estés aquí
Que cada día que pasa
Nada pasa y es mejor así

No sé qué nos pasó
Tú coqueteas y te escondes
Sin dar explicación

A veces creo que me estás enamorando
Y luego que te pierdo
No sé si estás fingiendo

Todo te cojo de tu vida de tus ojos
De tu boca, de tu cuerpo
De tu alma, de tus sueños

Todo te entrego por alguno de tus besos
De sentir como tu aliento
Va quemándome por dentro

Quiero todo de ti, de ti

Y aquellos besos que me diste
Nos los puedo olvidar y a veces siento
Que me tocas aunque ya aquí no estás
A veces siento que yo sólo vivo un sueño
Pero no me despierto porque si estoy sin ti
Me desespero

There is nothing wrong 
Just a dry spell of the heart

You escaped me one more time

You ripped my world apart 
And leave me in the dark

I know how much you need your space 
It’s a lonely place to find what you’ve been looking for 
You strayed off the beaten path 
And making your way back is harder than it was before 
Somebody got the best of you and left behind the rest of you 
Who used up your heart and kept you in the dark

Let me get this straight 
The reason why I wait 
I know you’ve been through so much pain 
Baby do I wait in vain 
If I could shed more light on you 
Tell you what was right for you 
Your beauty blinds me sure enough 
But my heart knows when it’s love

Arcade,"I heard the news, they told me on a Sunday
Opened my eyes, the skies they turned to grey
I count the years, the roll so slowly by me
Wish I could see you again
Ohhh it's so lonely, there
Ohhh it's so lonely

When I was young my daddy always taught me
To speak the truth and never tell lies
Now that I'm old and no one ever told me
The life you live, the truth you can disguise
Ohhh it's so lonely, there
Ohhh it's so lonely

[Chorus:]
I always looked but never found a trace
I always saw a smile without a face
I knew in time that I would find a way
I should have started by settin' my soul free
I can't make the time, stand still
But I will survive, the treason
No reason, alive... To cry no more

I heard your life was filled with hurt and pain
I never saw the tears roll down your face
There was nothing left for you to say
The day had shocked all your dreams away
Ohhh it's so lonely, there
Ohhh it's so lonely

[Chorus]

Down and out, I need a friend
Who'll be there until the end
Wait for me, and make my dreams come true
Make them all come true
I can't make the time, stand still

No reason, alive... To cry no more

When you look back now it doesn't seem so bad
It's the same old story, never get a second chance
You should be so lucky somebody took a stand

When the nights get longer
And you're lying all alone
When the pain gets stronger
You gotta make it on your own

You better take it as it comes
'Cause it's never enough
When you got nothin' to lose
Gotta get it on the run, baby
When you ain't got nothin'
You got nothin' to lose

If you knew back then what you know right now
Well, it might of been easy, still you made it somehow
You fell head over heels, you were down and out
But you came back strong from a whisper to a shout

When the nights get longer
And you're lying all alone
When the pain gets stronger
You gotta make it on your own

You better take it as it comes
'Cause it's never enough
When you got nothin' to lose
Gotta get it on the run, baby
When you ain't got nothin'
You got nothin' to lose

Did you do it like you should?
'Cause it's never enough
When you got nothin' to lose
I know you gave it all you could, baby

Woooahh where would I go
If I go on my way without you
Woooahh where would I go

I'm having flashbacks
Let me relax my dome
My whole joints blown another soldier won't be coming home
Parkside is gonna miss you black foreva
Ties will never sever
You died tryin to live better
Did what you had to do and now you deceased
I hope you livin in peace don't even stress that beef
Go head and sleep count your blessings return to the essence
Everytime I see your fam word is bon I feel your presence
Its all over bearing witness like jehovah
Ain't nothing strange unless you watch your range like a rover
Follow me son, what's done is done, forgot it
God bless his soul while his bodys underground rotting
We won't forget you let a brother try to dis you
I swear to god he better have a blade and plus a pistol
Forever miss you got babies that want to kiss you
Shining like crystal, and at your wake I pass your ma a tissue

[Chorus x2]

He was only thirteen when he burst his splean
The shot was fatal
He died right there upon the kitchen table BLAOW
It happened all alone in his house
Not a creature was stirrin, not a roach or a mouse
And I was just with him, playin Sega
And buggin on the horn with some honeys like a couple of playas
And now he's gone
I'm speakin on my man K-Shawn
Forever on my mind mentally as I kick my song
 
He used to talk about the box in the closet
Where his pops kept a glock and all the safety deposits
Now he stressed, fiendin just to hold some heat
I guess it came from all the stories that he heard in the street
I can't explain it, its ill how we used to feel
I used to tell him stop playin wit that chrome-piece steel
He never listened, and now my man is missin in action
I blame it on the fools in the street that's always blastin

[Chorus x2]

Aiyyo my dreams are filled with terror
Shots gettin nearer
Paralyzed and right in front of my eyes its gettin clearer
A tragedy resulted from a brothers bad scratch
Tried to rob a deli but the gat he had was raggy
Bullets sprayed, ricocheted and automatically
Hit a bystander, young girl named Amanda
The slugs in her back by this cat buggin no crap
Another rugrat, somebody tell me where the loves at
Was only seven already on her way to heaven
She reached her day and now she won't see her wedding
Some might say that this was destined or something
But her parents only had one child and now they left with nothing
Book all that flix and when they daughter was six
Before they moved from the bricks and got caught up in the mix
They thought things would get better now they stressed forever
They last vision was image of a blood-soaked sweater

Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti

I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

But I'm beginning to have my doubts

The rain can't get you wet

Can pay the interest on your debt?

And here in my own skin I can finally begin
Let the century pass me by, standing under the night sky

I heard a song from a speaker of a passing car
Praying to a dying star, the memories fading
I can almost remember singing( La la, la la, la la la la)
(La la, la la, la la la la)

We watched the end of the century
Compressed on a tiny screen
A dead star collapsing and we could see
Something was ending
Are you through pretending?
We saw the signs in the suburbs

We've already lost

For what we've lost

I will never raise my voice
All the diamonds you have here
In this home which has no life

Since I was a little child
Pray to God I won't live to see
The death of everything that's wild, woo!

Though we knew this day would come
Still it took us by surprise

Wasted hours that you make new
And turn into a life that we could live

Some cities make you lose your head
In this suburb stretched out thin and dead
What was that line you said?
Wishing you were anywhere but here
You watched the life you're living disappear
and now I see, we're still kids in the buses longing to be free

Wasted hours before we new
Where to go and what to do
Wasted hours that you make new
Turn into a life that we could live",Wasted Hours
Arcade Fire,"I used to write
I used to write letters
I used to sign my name
I used to sleep at night
Before the flashing lights settled deep in my brain
But by the time we met
By the time we met
The times had already changed

So I never wrote a letter
I never took my true heart
I never wrote it down
So when the lights cut out
I was lost standing in the wilderness downtown

Now our lives are changing fast
Now our lives are changing fast
Hope that something pure can last
Hope that something pure can last

It seems strange
How we used to wait for letters to arrive
But what's stranger still
Is how something so small can keep you alive
We used to wait
We used to waste hours just walkin' around
We used to wait
All those wasted lives in the wilderness downtown

Ooooo we used to wait
Ooooo we used to wait
Ooooo we used to wait
Sometimes it never came (we used to wait)
Sometimes it never came (we used to wait)
Still moving through the pain

I'm gonna write a letter to my true love
I'm gonna sign my name
Like a patient on a table
I wanna walk again
Gonna move through the pain

Now our lives are changing fast
Now our lives are changing fast
Hope that something pure can last
Hope that something pure can last

Ooooo we used to wait
Ooooo we used to wait
Ooooo we used to wait
Sometimes it never came (we used to wait)
Sometimes it never came (we used to wait)

We used to wait for it
We used to wait for it
Now we're screaming

Arcadia,"Enter newborn players and gather
Weigh their innocence
Only the brightest shine
But not forever
Many lights die, many tears rain
When those tears run dry
On a mountain madness day
 
You were just in time
For a foolish deal ... a lover sold
I can't stand another howling day
Inside of this empty skin
 
While the beacons burn a flame
Please return from so far away
 
One life with the devil do I play
For so long el diablo is to blame
 
Oh el diablo, el diablo, won't you sell me back my soul?
Oh el diablo, el diablo, won't you sell me back my soul?
 
Weddings on the wind, will she blow my way?
He can dance and she can sing
She will tear your heart away
While the promise burns a flame
And will you return from so far away?
  
One life with the devil do I play
For so long, el diablo is to blame
One life with the devil do I play
For so long, el diablo is to blame
One life but the devil is in my way",El Diablo
Arcadia,"I could feel the breeze blowing chance
Blowing through my doorway
Warm and restless just as you walked by
Inside of smoky halls a circle drawn
And voices call
To raise some magic wind in my world
Strange coincidence each time you look my way
This sinking feeling scares me
Know my weakness call it dejavu
Never puy my trust in fate suprises do arrive so late
Why should I be surprised by you
 
Straight to the heart straight for this precious shining
How do you dare step into my flame
One from the heart, one for this precious shining
How can you steel my flame
 
Sometimes cards are drawn and the tables turn
The waiting game is over
Take this dealers hand and steal away the dawn
Don't give me any chance to wander back from this innocence
Don't give me any chances at all",The Flame
Arcadia,"Sometimes you have no choice
Sometimes you've got no voice to say
Say if you will the words
Say if your world is so gray
We can decide this
There'll be no tears
No tradgedy
Sure I wouldn't break and cry, if...
You walk away
Believe me

Hey, goodbye
Goodbye is forever
Hey, forever
Goodbye is forever
And ever...

Sometimes it makes no sense,
This side of cruel coincidence
Caught up in our own barbed wire
To set us free
Believe this

Hey, goodbye
Goodbye is forever
Hey, forever
Goodbye is forever
And ever...",Goodbye Is Forever
Arcadia,"When the evening's sunlight fingers
Stretch across the floor
Cover up your eyes with feathers
Softly close the door
Take me in your heavy lips
Take me where the shadows lye
I need your blind full secrets
Hunting fast and loose
The lacy intrigue of this weekend
Should not be abused

[Chorus:]
You could take me where you want
Could you take me all the time
Away yeah...wait a little longer
Don't go to far
I wouldn't like
I wouldn't like you keeping me in the dark
 
Tender is the truce I'm tasting
Watching you dictate
Heady nights of sleepless wasting
A face I can't escape
We could wave the world goodbye
To all of the boys cheerio
 
[Chorus]
 
Help me now I'm slipping deeper
Tell me what to say
When without words you call me closer
Each time you turn away
Something inside you cries
But is it something I'll never find
 
Away yeah...Wait a little longer
Don't go too far
I wouldn't like
I wouldn't like you keeping me in the dark
Away yeah...Wait a little longer 
Before we go too far
I wouldn't like
I wouldn't like to think you were
Keeping me in the dark",Keep Me in the Dark
Arcadia,"Lady Ice slips into her soul
Lady Ice leaves a house so cold
Lady Ice did you know that the world was lonely too?
 
Drifting snow
Searching flames and hide
Burning stones as she looks
For the heart somebody stole
 
She knows the violations
Lovers' arms without occasion
Who knows where to find a true heart
For Lady Ice
 
Mezmerized in the candle flame
Compromised by the cruel bands of steel around her breast
 
She knows the desolation
Lovers' arms, their isolation
Who knows where to find a true heart
For Lady Ice?
 
Lady's eyes slip away
From the part she plays in school
 
She knows of roles and hide-aways
Suppose she knows the time's away?
She knows where to find a true heart for Lady Ice...",Lady Ice
Arcadia,"And as I wander down to where you lay
The blood rushed up to meet the roses
In your hair
I thought I saw you smile
But now I don't see you anywhere
Whispering your love song in my ear
How can you touch me
When you're not really there?
 
Stumbling out I made my way towards the open door
Climbing fast the sun broad streaming
Laughter down into your empty gaze
Where can I find out
How I want to join in your games
I hear you calling
I hear you...calling calling calling calling
Whispering your love song in my ear
How can you touch me?
How do you really dare?",Missing
Arcadia,"Those tears on a gaping voice
Who's stretching arms match the hunger of mine
There lips will they never join
But always draw me closer and further entwined
 
With a promise dealer understand all freedoms fade away
To a point of view where many different pathways meet
And we're standing on this precipice with nothing much to gain save
But the deep blue screams of falling dreams with our next mov
 
Heaven hide your eyes
Heaven's eyes will never dry
 
The shades of a thousand steel
Come flashing by my face in the fury of war
In desolation and abandoned fields
The hungry make their stand when they'll stand for no more
 
Hear the passion in their voices see the heaven in their eyes
Their hopes and schemes are waiting dreams of less than paradise
And sometimes we make promises we never mean to keep
For blackmail is the only deal a promise dealer sees
 
Heaven hide your eyes
Heaven's eyes will never dry",The Promise

Hablarte, darte besitos en el oído 
Pa' sentir tus suspiros y sacarte gemidos

Tu corazón palpita mientras te doy mamita

ÚLtimamente en la calle me contaron que andas muy mal (Que andas muy mal) 
Llorando por ese idiota que no te deja ni respirar 
Y yo esperando la oportunidad, de cualquier día poderte besar 
Y te lo juro ya no aguanto más 

Imagínate, tu cuerpo junto al mío 
Tus labios junto a los míos bebé 
Baby imagínate dos locos haciendo el amor oh oh 
El amor oh oh

Tengo un vicio por ti 
Buscando que vuelvas a mi (N.I.C.K) 
No encuentro la manera de llegar a ti (Austin) 
Bendita noche, por ti viví mamita yo iré (Luian) 
Buscando una señal, no sé si estás igual
No me puedo controlar, sigo esperando a que vuelvas 

Pensándote, recordando todo tu cuerpo (hey) 
Cuando te acostabas en mi pecho 
Después de haber hecho el amor en exceso (ok) 

Pensándote, recordando todo tu cuerpo 
Cuando te acostabas en mi pecho 
Después de haber hecho el amor en exceso 

Haciéndote el amor yo me di cuenta 
Que el amor que siento por ti no está en venta 
Que tampoco me importa lo que diga la gente 
No se presta ni se renta 

Tu eras otra cosa mami 
Estaba para ti y tú siempre pa' mí 
Eramos Bonny and Clyde modernos 
Aunque nadie quería entendernos 

Y por eso me fui al más allá por ti 
Por tu piel y solo por ti 
Ando mal, más que mal o más que loco 
Patinando mal del coco, tú me tienes a mí 

Pensándote, recordando todo tu cuerpo 
Cuando te acostabas en mi pecho 
Después de haber hecho el amor en exceso 

Pensándote, recordando todo tu cuerpo 
Cuando te acostabas en mi pecho 
Después de haber hecho el amor en exceso 

Aquí te espero, si te acercas 
Ven donde mí, te siento cerca 
No te alejes
En la guerra del amor, me muero si no me proteges 

Cuídame, vélame, abrázame 
Bésame, tócame, siénteme 
Ya que ando mal, más que mal o más que loco

Aquí me tienes pensando en ti como siempre, 
Bajo la sombra de la duda 
Esperando inventar el pretexto más tonto 
Para salir a buscarte 
Y arrojar las palabras que me traigo 
Para confesarte la falta que me haces 
¿Quieres que te sea sincero? 
No sabía que decir y me metí a internet 
A buscar un mensaje bonito y te lo dediqué

Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

Face and body Frontenac, don't know how to act
Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Making a living off my brain, instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my momma put the whip in my own name now
Damn shit done changed now
Running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White

Check, check, yo, I know something you don't know
And I've got something to tell ya
You won't believe how many people straight doubted the flow
Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough
And I'm yelling: ""I can't help ya""
""But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?""
Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!

Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
Niggas want to know why: why I fly by
But yo, it's all good, Range Rover all wood
Do me like you should - fuck me good, suck me good
We be them stud niggas, 'wishing you was' niggas
Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Crissy, bubb' macking
Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends
So if shorty want to knock, we knocking to this
And if shorty want to rock, we rocking to this
And if shorty want to pop, we popping the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention
See the ice and the glist'; niggas staring or they diss
Honies looking all ""they wish"" - come on boo, gimme kiss

Archie Eversole,"Why me Lord, what have I ever done
To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth loving you
Or the kindness you've shown.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

Tell me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you.

Archie Shepp,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say 
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For what ever my man is 
I am his forever more",My Man

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

When that's where you left your heart
And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans",Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?

I guess I'll go through life

I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name

Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky

And you can get it if you try

Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Marre d'emprunter tes couloirs à la peinture écaillée 
Quand ta progéniture de chat les baptises
Elle scouate des halls marbrés
Et vit sous les ors
D'un huit-pièce aulyrique

It's an exploration, she's made of outer space
And her lips are like the galaxy's edge
And her kiss the colour of a constellation falling into place

My days end best when this sunset gets itself
Behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catching the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

As Arabella
As Arabella
Just might have tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

That's magic in a cheetah print coat
Just a slip underneath it I hope
Asking if I can have one of those
Organic cigarettes that she smokes
Wraps her lips round the Mexican coke
Makes you wish that you were the bottle
Takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like…

Arcturus,"From childhood's hour I have not been
As others were - I have not seen
As others saw - I could not bring
My passions from a common spring.

From the same source I have not taken
My sorrow; I could not awaken
My heart to joy at the same tone;
And all I loved, I loved alone.

Then - in my childhood - in the dawn
Of a most stormy life - was drawn
From every depth of good and ill
The mystery which binds me still:

From the torrent, or the fountain,
From the red cliff of the mountain,
From the sun that 'round me rolled
In it's autumn tint of gold 

From the lightning in the sky
As it passed me flying by
From the thunder and the storm,
And the cloud that took the form

Of a demon in my view.",Alone

Illuminated by an exquisite grimace,

He is profanity in sanctity's guise
An alias assumed I do recognize
In their eyes, his cause 
When enticing and cunning in impact

So look for him vainly, He,

Arrangements of magical nature
He turns unrecognizable even to the
Experienced eye.

You obsessively pursue him
Falling to see, that was why he came to be
One who annihilates with such impunity

He appears your friend, but
The Saint hides many Satan's
He's contemptuous, you know
Of your God given stupidities
He calls you in question which
Affected modesty and create
Of you an object of derision

You think him to be the pariah
Whom company does exclude
But in the midst of all frenzy
He is, feasting in a transitory mood

Passion is strict lord
He is also its humble slave
When bereft of common ways,
He strides before you on water
He makes clowns of kings,
Charms the guests, rides the ball 
Is the master of disguise

Which invites reason to demise,

But you dodge the truth like so many passing cars
Oh no - be wary of your heroes
Change the way the wind blows
Change the way the wind blows
So long",Change
Arcwelder,"And all you want to do is smile
And take it everywhere you've been
Advice like yours a moral play
I'd walk from hear to here you say
And death's not knowing that your dead
Never life or fear or trial
So you want happiness instead
All you got is just a smile

[chorus]
All you want to do is smile
All you got to do is smile

Can't help the helpless with your help
Can't be the selfless by yourself
Can't turn an inch into a mile
Can't make me happy with a smile

Stood in a forest for the fools
And said what no one wants to hear
A tree that falls without a sound
Take your smile I'll be around

[chorus]",Smile
Arcwelder,"(s macdonald)
Is it the same old, is it the same again
Or will I find something new
Throw on a blindfold, throw out my name at them
Throw out my pride with it too
Why do I do it, nobody wants to starve
Don't want to bury myself
I'm a conduit, and that's my heart you carve
Into the base for your wealth

[chorus]
What do I want, I want to know
What do I want, I want to know
What do I want, I want to know
What do I want, I want to know

Please let me stay free, sit on my butt all day
Just throw the cash right on in
I'll make you happy, I'll stay the hell away
You think I lose but I win
Don't brush me off now, you think you don't need me
There's probably no time to think
I am your cash cow, moronic fantasy
I am the whole kitchen sink
