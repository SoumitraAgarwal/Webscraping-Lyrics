Andy Williams,"Sleigh bells ring
Are you listening
In the lane
Snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He singing a song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say 'Are you married?'
We'll say 'No man'
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on
We'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland

Sleigh bells ring
Are you listening
In the lane
Snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a  love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

Sleigh bells ring",Winter Wonderland
Andy Williams,"Quiet nights of quiet stars
Quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us

Quiet nights and dreams
Quiet walks by quiet streams
And a window looking on the
Mountains and the sea, how lovely

This is where I want to be
Here with you so close to me
Till the final flicker of life's ember

I, who was lost and lonely
Believing life was only a bitter, tragic joke
Have found with you
The meaning of existence, oh, my love

This is where I want to be
Here with you so close to me
Till the final flicker of life's ember

I, who was lost and lonely
Believing life was only a tragic joke
Have found with you
The meaning of existence, oh, my love",Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars (Corcovado)
Andy Williams,"The days of wine and roses
Laugh and run away like a child at play
Through a meadow land toward a closing door
A door marked nevermore, that wasn't there before

The lonely night discloses
Just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you

(The lonely night discloses)

Just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you",Days of Wine and Roses [From Days of Wine and Roses]
Andy Williams,"(That baby doll) ooh
(Look out for her) baby doll
(Especially) hmm
(The amateur)

There's many a guy who'll sing you these blues
His dream was a lie, his heart's in his shoes
He wasn't so green, in ways he was smart
Till she hit the scene and she took him apart
He'll tell you as plain as day
Keep away from baby doll

(That baby doll)
(Look out for her)

You'll see in her eyes the warning you should
You oughta be ooh-eyed, she'll lose you but good
As long as she's warm, the livin' is sweet
Then she'll raise a storm, you're back on the street
You might as well know, my friend, that's the end
You're cooked, you're through
(My friend, you're through)
(You're cooked, you're through)

She was my baby doll and she'll do the same to you

Andy Williams,"Beyond the reef
Where the sea is dark and cold,
My love has gone,
And our dreams grow old.
There'll be no tears,
There'll be no regretting.
Will she remember me,
Will she forget?
I'll send a thousand flow'rs
When the trade winds blow.
I'll send my lonely heart,
For i love her so.
Someday i know
She'll come back again to me.
Till then my heart will be
Beyond the reef

Some day i know
She'll come back again to me
Till then my heart will be
Beyond the reef",Beyond the Reef
Andy Williams,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part",Canadian Sunset
Andy Williams,"I'm in Dreamsville, holding you
I'm dreaming you
Just we two alone in love in Dreamsville
Time is new, we're here to love
A-and we do

We can see the rest of the world below us from our pink cloud
There's no boundary to this magic light
As we go exploring hand-in-hand in dreamy Dreamsville
Far away 
And here we love
Here we'll stay",Dreamsville
Andy Williams,"This is the moment
I've waited for
I can hear my heart singing
Soon bells will be ringing

This is the moment
Of sweet aloha
I will love you longer than forever
Promise me that you will leave me never

Here and now dear
All my love
I vow dear
Promise me that you will leave me never
I will love you longer than forever

Now that we are one
Clouds won't hide the sun

On this, our wedding day
I do (I do) love you (love you) with all my heart",The Hawaiian Wedding Song

Andy Williams,"I tasted your sweet lips
Thrilled to my fingertips
Lips of wine, warm with fire, you are my one desire
Lips of wine, and they are mine

While tropic breezes play
While palm trees gently sway
Lips of wine, come to me, whisper low so tenderly
Lips of wine, and they are mine

Sweet Hawaiian miss, no more will I roam
I must have your kiss and I can't go home

You stole my heart from me
Pretty rose of Waikiki
Lips of wine, sweet and rare, tell me you will always care
Lips of wine, and they are mine

(Sweet lips, sweet and tasty lips)

Sweet Hawaiian miss, no more will I roam
I must have your kiss and I can't go home

Andy Williams,"Where's this place called lonely street?

I'm looking for that lonely street
I've got a sad, sad tale to tell
I need a place to go and weep
Where's this place called lonely street?

A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and mem'ries meet
Where's this place called lonely street?

Perhaps upon that lonely street
There's someone such as I
Who came to bury broken dreams
And watch an old love die

If I could find that lonely street
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and mem'ries meet
Where's this place called lonely street?

Where's this place called lonely street?",Lonely Street
Andy Williams,"Ah
I've traveled far, the land and the sea
Beautiful places I happened to be
One little town I'll never forget
Is Lourdes, the village of Saint Bernadette

Ave, ave, ave Maria
Ave, ave, ave Maria

There, like a dream, this wonderful night
I gazed at the grotto aglow in the light
A feeling divine swept over me there
I fell to my knees as I whispered the prayer

Ave, ave, ave Maria
Ave, ave, ave Maria

Now I am home, I'm happy to be
Telling of places I've traveled to see
One little town I'll never forget

Andy Williams,"If I am dreaming you've got your arms around me
Wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over
Not before

And if I'm dreaming that love at last has found me
Let me go on dreaming
Wake me when it's over and then let me go to sleep
Mmh, again

It's hard to believe, my dear, that you're here at all
Incredible, I pinch myself, you don't disappear at all
So if I'm hearing you tell some small-town justice, you will not forsake me
Takin' vows to make me yours, ever more
Then darling, wake me when it's over, and not before

Oh, wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over, and then back to sleep again

It's hard to believe, my dear, that you're here at all
Incredible, you don't disappear at all

Andy Williams,"Ah, ah
Walk hand in hand with me through all eternity
Have faith, believe in me, give me your hand
Love is a symphony of perfect harmony
When lovers such as we walk hand in hand

Be not afraid, for I am with you all the while
So lift your head up high and look toward the sky

Andy Williams,"Where do I begin
To tell the story of how great a love can be
The sweet love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me
Where do I start

With her first hello
She gave new meaning to this empty world of mine
There'd never be another love, another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart

She fills my heart with very special things
With angels' songs, with wild imaginings
She fills my soul with so much love
That anywhere I go I'm never lonely
With her around, who could be lonely
I reach for her hand, it's always there

How long does it last
Can love be measured by the hours in a day
I have no answers now but this much I can say
I know I'll need her 'till the stars all burn away
And she'll be there

How wonderful, wonderful our love will be
For you, for me

We're almost there where we will share
A warm caress, tenderness, a dream come true
For me, for you

Love has waited such a long time
Now we're a kiss apart

To let the kisses start

For you're almost mine and soon we'll find
Our paradise, paradise so rare

I'll find some crowded avenue
Though it will be empty without you

Can't get used to losin' you no matter what I try to do
Gonna live my whole life thorough loving you

Called up some girl I used to know
After I heard her say hello
Couldn't think of anything to say
Since you're gone it happens every day

Can't get used to losin' you no matter what I try to do
Gonna live my whole life through, loving you 

I'll find somebody, wait and see
Who am I kiddin', only me

This is the love I give to you alone
More than the simplest words I try to say
I only live to love you more each day

My life will be in your keeping, waking, sleeping, laughing, weeping
Longer than always is long, long time,

The Autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sunburned hand I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long

Andy Williams,"I was sleeping and right in the middle of a good dream
Like all at once I wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you (I think I love you)

This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room
I think I love you (I think I love you)

I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I got so much to think about

Hey, I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say I never felt this way

Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy and if you say ""hey go away"" I will
But I think better still I'd better stay around and love you
Do you think I have a case let me ask you to your face
Do you think you love me?

Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's no secret anymore

Andy Williams,"Strangers in the night exchanging glances
Wondering in the night
What were the chances wed be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in you smile was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night, two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello
Little did we know love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away and

Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right

Andy Williams,"Some children see him


Some children see him lily white,
The baby jesus born this night,
Some children see him lily white,
With tresses soft and fair.

Some children see him bronzed and brown,
The lord of heav'n to earth come down;
Some children see him bronzed and brown,
With dark and heavy hair.

Some children see him almond-eyed,
This savior whom we kneel beside,
Some children see him almond-eyed,
With skin of yellow hue.

Some children see him dark as they,
Sweet mary's son to whom we pray,
Some children see him dark as they,
And, ah! they love him, too!

The children in each diff'rent place
Will see the baby jesus' face
Like theirs, but bright with heav'nly grace,
And filled with holy light.

O lay aside each earthly thing,
And with thy heart as offering,
Come worship now the infant king.
'tis love that's born tonight!

Andy Williams,"What child is this laid to rest
While Mary's man is sleeping
Whom angles greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch their king

Why lies he in such lowly place
While cows and sheep are feeding

A silent word is pleading

This is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angles sing
Hast hast to bring him praise

So bring him incense, gold, and myrrh
Come peasant King to owe him
The king of kings salvation bring

Except for the few that were there in your eyes

Dear, as I held you close in my arms
Angels were singing a hymn to your charms
Two hearts gently beating, murmuring low
""Darling, I love you so""

The night seemed to fade into blossoming dawn
The sun shone anew but the dance lingered on
Could we but recall that sweet moment sublime
We'd find that our love is unaltered by time

Dear, as I held you close in my arms
Angels were singing a hymn to your charms
Two hearts gently beating, murmuring low
""Darling, I love you so""",Anniversary Song
Andy Williams,"Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning
This need that you and you alone create
Just fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams
The dreams that you inspire with ev'ry sweet desire
Be my love, and with your kisses set me burning
One kiss is all I need to seal my fate
And hand in hand, we'll find love's promised land
There'll be no one but you, for me eternally
If you will be my love

Andy Williams,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

 I was serenely independent and content before we met
 Surely I could always be that way again and yet
 I've grown accustomed to her looks, accustomed to her voice

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night

But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before

Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour out of every door?
No, it's just on the street where you live

And oh, the towering feeling just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling that any second you may suddenly appear

Can be here on the street where you live",On the Street Where You Live
Andy Williams,"Once upon a time a girl with moonlight in her eyes
Put her hand in mine and said she loved me so;
But that was once upon a time, very long ago.

Once upon a hill we sat beneath a willow tree
Counting all the stars and waiting for the dawn
But that was once upon a time, now the tree is gone.

How the breeze ruffled through her hair;
How we always laughed as though tomorrow wasn't there.

Everything was ours, how happy we were then!

I worry and wonder.
Your lips may be near,
but where is your heart?

It's always like this,
I worry and wonder.
You're close to me here,

It's a sad thing to realize 
that you've a heart that never melts.

pretending that I'm someone else?

You must break the spell,
this cloud that I'm under.
So please won't you tell, darling,
where is your heart?

That warm my heart and see my morning sun

When myself is feelin' low
Think about her face aglow and ease my mind

Sometimes I call her up at home knowing she's busy
And ask if she could get away and meet me and grab a bite to eat
Then she drops what she's doin' and hurries down to meet me
And I'm always late but she sits waitin' patiently
And smiles when she first sees me 'cause she's made that way

And if that's not lovin' me then all I've got to say

Andy Williams,"Where's this place called Lonely Street

I'm looking for that lonely street

I've got a sad, sad tale to tell
I need a place to go and weep
Where's this place called Lonely Street

A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and memories meet
Where's this place called Lonely Street

Perhaps upon that lonely street
There's someone such as I
Who came to bury broken dreams
And watch an old love die

If I could find that lonely street
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and memories meet
Where's this place called Lonely Street

For wives should always be lovers too

Day after day, there are girls at the office
And men will always be men
Don't send him off with your hair still in curlers
You may not see him again

For wives should always be lovers too
Run to his arms the moment he comes home to you

And dim all the lights, pour the wine
Start the music, time to get ready for love

Let him touch you and watch what happens
One someone who can look in your eyes

And see into your heart
Let him find you and watch what happens
Cold, no I won't believe your heart is cold
Maybe just afraid to be broken again

Let someone with a deep love to give
Give that deep love to you
And what magic you'll see
Let someone with a deep love to give

Give that deep love to you
And what magic you'll see
Let someone give his heart
Someone who cares like me

Cold, no, I can't believe your heart is cold
Maybe slow to warm from a long, lonely night

Andy Williams,"What now, my love
Now that you've left me
How can I live
Through another day
Watching my dreams
Turn into ashes
And my hopes
Into bits of clay
Once I could see
Once I could feel
Now I am numb
I've become unreal
I walk the night
Oh without a goal
Stripped of my heart
And my soul
What now, my love
Now that it's over
I feel the world
Closing in on me
Here come the stars
Tumbling around me
And there's the sky
Where the sea should be
What now, my love
Now that you're gone
I'd be a fool
To go on and on
No one would care
No one would cry
If I should live
If I should die
What now, my love
Now there is nothing
Only my last goodbye
Only my last
My last goodbye","What Now, My Love?"
Andy Williams,"When I look in your eyes
I see the wisdom of the world in your eyes
I see the sadness of a thousand goodbyes
When I look in your eyes
And it is no surprise
To see the softness of the moon in your eyes
The gentle sparkle of the stars in the skies
When I look in your eyes
In your eyes
I see the deepness of the sea
I see the deepness of the love
The love I feel you feel for me
Autumn comes, summer dies
I see the passing of the years in your eyes
And when we part there'll be not tears, no good-byes
I'll just look into your eyes
In your eyes
I see the deepness of the sea
I see the deepness of the love
The love I feel you feel for me
Autumn comes, summer dies
I see the passing of the years in your eyes
And when we part there'll be not tears, no good-byes
I'll just look into your eyes

How I love the world your eyes reveal",When I Look in Your Eyes
Andy Williams,"There will be many other nights like this
And I'll be standing here with someone new
There will be other songs to sing, another fall, another spring
But there will never be another you

There will be other lips that I may kiss
But they won't thrill me like yours used to do
Yes, I may dream a million dreams but how can they come true
If there will never ever be another you

There will be other lips that I may kiss
But they won't thrill me like yours used to do
Yes, I may dream a million dreams but how can they come true
If there will never ever be another you

Andy Williams,"Where do I begin
To tell the story of how great a love can be 
The sweet love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me? 
Where do I start? 

With her first hello
She gave a meaning to this empty world of mine
There’d never be another love, another time 
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart

She fills my heart with very special things
With angel songs, with wild imaginings
She fills my soul with so much love
That anywhere I go, I’m never lonely
With her along, who could be lonely? 
I reach for her hand, it’s always there

How long does it last? 
Can love be measured by the hours in a day? 
I have no answers now, but this much I can say
I know I’ll need her till the stars all burn away
And she’ll be there!",Where Do I Begin? (Love Story)
Andy Williams,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety two
Although it's been said many times many ways
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you",The Christmas Song [Live]
Andy Williams,"Quiet nights 'n quiet stars, quiet chords from my guitar 
Floating on the silence that surrounds us 
Quiet thoughts 'n quiet dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams 
Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together 

We will live eternally in this mood of reverie 
Away from all the earthly cares around us 
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it 
And all at once the happiness I knew, 
Became these quiet nights of loving you! 

We will live eternally in this mood of reverie

Andy Williams,"If ever I would leave you, it wouldn't be in summer
Seeing you in summer, I never would go
Your hair streaked with sunlight, your lips red as flame
Your face with a luster that puts gold to shame

But if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn
How I'd leave in autumn, I never will know
I've seen how you sparkle when fall nips the air
I know you in autumn and I must be there

And could I leave you running merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow

If ever I would leave you, how could it be in springtime
Knowing how in spring I'm bewitched by you so
Oh, no, not in springtime, summer, winter, or fall
No never could I leave you at all",If Ever I Would Leave You
Andy Williams,"There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon

I'm going to pick that rose 
And watch her as she grows in my garden

Andy Williams,"The summer wind came blowin' in
From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair 
And walk with me

All summer long
We sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than
The piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you to
The summer wind 

The autumn wind
And the winter wind
They have come and they have gone
And still the days
Those lonely days
Go on and on

And guess who sighs a lullaby
To nights that never end?

Mmm the summer wind

Andy Williams,"The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before it always leads me here
Leads me to your door

The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know the many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to you door

But still they lead me back to the long and winding road

How much I want you back again.

Andy Williams,"Can't we two go walkin' together out beyond the valley of trees?
Out where there's a hillside of heather curtseyin' gently in the breeze
That's what I'd like to do; see the heather but with you.
The mist of May is in the gloamin',and all the clouds are holdin' still
So take my hand and let's go roamin'through the heather on the hill.
The mornin' dew is blinkin' yonder,there's lazy music in the rill,
And all I want to do is wander through the heather on the hill.
There may be other days as rich and rare,
There may be other springs as full and fare,
But the won't be the same, they'll come and go
For this I know;
That when the mist is in gloamin'
And all the clouds are holdin' still,
If you're not there I won't go roamin' through the heather on the hill, 
The heather on the hill.
The mist of May is in the gloamin',and all the clouds are holdin' still

Alone, watching lovers passing by

When I am kissed, I want her lips to really kiss me
When we're apart, I want her heart to really miss me
I want to know she loves me so, her eyes been misty

Alone, just my lonely heart knows how
I want to be wanted, right now

Are passing fancies

And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud,
I can' t understand
I get misty, just holding your hand.
Walk my way,
And a thousand violins begin to play,
Or it might be the sound of your hello,
That music I hear,
I get misty, the moment you're near.
Can't you see that you're leading me on?
And it's just what I want you to do,
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you.
On my own,
When I wander through this wonderland alone,
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love.
Too misty,

I find I have the time of my life
Learning to enjoy at my leisure
All the simple pleasures
And so I happily concede
That this is all I ask
This is all I need

Beautiful girls, walk a little slower when you walk by me
Lingering sunsets, stay a little longer with the lonely sea
Children everywhere, when you shoot at bad men, shoot at me
Take me to that strange, enchanted land grown-ups seldom understand

Wandering rainbows, leave a bit of color for my heart to own
Stars in the sky, make my wish come true before the night has flown
And let the music play as long as there's a song to sing
And I will stay younger than Spring",This Is All I Ask

So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Andy Williams,"Touch me in the morning
Then just walk away
We don't have tomorrow
But we had yesterday

(Hey!)
Wasn't it me who said that
Nothing good's gonna last forever?
And wasn't it me who said
Let's just be glad for the time together?
It must've been hard to tell me
That you've given all you had to give
I can understand you're feeling that way
Everybody's got their life to live

Well, I can say goodbye in the cold morning light
But I can't watch love die in the warmth of the night
If I've got to be strong
Don't you know I need to have tonight when you're gone?
'Till you go I need to lie here and think about
The last time that you'll touch me in the morning
Then just close the door
Leave me as you found me, empty like before

(Hey!)
Wasn't it yesterday
We used to laugh at the wind behind us?
Didn't we run away and hope
That time wouldn't try to find us (Didn't we run)
Didn't we take each other
To a place where no one's ever been?
Yeah, I really need you near me tonight
'Cause you'll never take me there again
Let me watch you go
With the sun in my eyes
We've seen how love can grow
Now we'll see how it dies

If I've got to be strong
Don't you know I need to have tonight when you're gone?
'Till you go I need to hold you until the time
Your hands reach out and touch me in the morning
(Mornings where blue and gold and we could feel one another living)
Then just walk away
(We walked with a dream to hold and we could take what the world was giving)
We don't have tomorrow,
(There's no tomorrow here, there's only love and the time to chase it)
But we had yesterday
(But yesterday's gone my love, there's only now and it's time to face it)
Touch me in the morning...

Andy Williams,"Rows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons ev'rywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on ev'ryone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way
I've looked at clouds from both sides now

From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As ev'ry fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained
In living ev'ry day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all
I've looked at life from both sides now
From up and dawn, and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all",Both Sides Now

Andy Williams,"April gave us springtime and the promise of the flowers
And the feeling that we both shared and the love that we called ours
We had no time for sadness, that's a road we each had crossed
We were living a time meant for us, and even when it would rain
we would laugh it off.

I've got pieces of April, I keep them in a memory bouquet
I've got pieces of April, but it's a morning in May

We stood on the crest of summer, beneath an oak that blossemed green
Feeling as I did in April, not really knowing what it means
But it must be then that you stand beside me now to make me feel this way
Just as I did in April, but it's a morning in May.

And she touch'd me for a moment,
with a look that spoke to me of her sweet love.
Then the woman that she was drove her on with desperation,
and I saw as she went a most hopeless situation.
For Joanne, and the man, and the time that made them both wrong.
 
She was only a girl, I know that will, and still I could not see;
That the hold she had was much stronger than the love she had for me.
But staying with her, and my little bit of wisdom,
broke down her desires like a light thru a prism;
into yellows and blues and a tune that I could not have sung.
 
Tho' the essence is gone,
I have no tear to cry for her 
and my only tho't of her is kind.

The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring

Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you
When you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day

And if I could you know that I would

But friend it hasn't been too long, it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted, it was just a twig

And then the first snow came
And she ran out to brush the snow away so it wouldn't die
Came running in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself, I laughed till I cried

She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so
And I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago

And it would sure embarrass her
When I came home from working late 'cause I would know
That she'd been there a crying
Over some sad and silly late, late show

And honey, I miss you
And I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

She wrecked the car and she was sad
So afraid that I'd be mad but what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me and hugged my neck

I came home unexpectedly
Found her crying needlessly in the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and Robins sing, she went away

And honey, I miss you
And I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

Yes, one day while I was not at home
While she was there and all alone the angels came
Now all I have is memories
Of honey and I wake up nights and call her name

And now my life's an empty stage
Where honey lived and honey played and love grew up
A small cloud passes overhead
And cries down on the flower bed that honey loved

Yes, see the tree how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long, it wasn't big

Andy Williams,"Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only `cos you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

Andy Williams,"Softly I will leave you softly 
For my heart would break if you should wake and see me go
So I leave you softly long before you miss me

Andy Williams,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember

Andy Williams,"Yesterday when I was young,
The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue,
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game,
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame;
The thousand dreams I dreamed,
The splendid things I planned
I always built, alas,
On weak and shifting sand;
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
And only now I see how the years ran away

Yesterday, when I was young,
So many happy songs were waiting to be sung,
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see,

I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out,
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall concerned itself with me
And nothing else at all

Yesterday the moon was blue,
And every crazy day brought something new to do,
I used my magic age as if it were a wand,
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond;
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died;
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung,
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue,
The time has come for me to pay for Yesterday
When I was Young

Yesterday, when I was young,
So many happy songs were waiting to be sung,
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me

Won't ease my memory 
It's killing me now
And Lord how I need him here 
Just to feel him near 
And hear him breathing

Another lonely song I'm singing
Lord don't think bad of me 
Don't get mad at me you know I'm weak
And it couldn't cause a whole lot of harm 
To be in somebody's arms
Cause she's in his 
I know she is 
I know she is 
But God I love him
And though 
I shouldn't give a damn 
That's the way I am now
And Lord 
Guess I'll stay this way 
I can't play this way

we went so high we couldn't stop
we climbed the ladder leading us nowhere 
Two of us together building castles in the air 
We spun so fast we couldn't tell 
the gold ring from the carousel 
How could we know the right would turn-out bad
Everything we wanted, was everything we had
I miss the Hungry Years 
the once upon a time 
the lovely long ago 
we didn't a dime 
those days of me and you, 
we lost along the way 
how could I be so blind 
not to see the door 
closing on the World 
I now hunger for 
Looking through my tears, 
I miss the Hungry years
We shared our day dreams one by one 
Making plans was so much fun 
We set our goals and reached the highest star 
Things that we were after were much better from afar
Here we stand just me and you 
with everything and nothing too 
It wasn't worth the price we had to pay 
Honey take me home Let's go back to yesterday
I miss the Hungry Years 
the once upon a time the lovely long ago 
we didn't have a dime

Caught up in a world of uphill climbing

And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself, it's easy to pretend

Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere

And through the night, his sleepless nights

Andy Williams,"To dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go

To right the unrightable wrong
To love pure and chaste from afar
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star

This is my quest, to follow that star,
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far
To fight for the right without question or cause
To be willing to march into hell for a heavenly cause

And I know if I'll only be true to this glorious quest
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm when I'm laid to my rest

And the world will be better for this
That one man scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To fight the unbeatable foe, to reach the unreachable star",The Impossible Dream

And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
Sleepin' on the job
Those raindrops keep falling on my head, they keep falling

But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me, won't defeat me
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Crying's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'

Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me

Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten

May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

You whispered low

The midnight sun was shining too
No more is night a wild delight

Against a flaming sky and sea
And then I know, though I'm a fool to care

Andy Williams,"This is the moment I've waited for
I can hear my heart singing
Soon bells will be ringing
This is the moment of sweet aloha
I will love you longer than forever
Promise me that you will
Leave me never

All my love I vow, dear
Promise me that you will
Leave me never

Andy Williams,"One dream in my heart, one love to be living for,
One love to be living for, this nearly was mine.
One girl for my dream, one partner in paradise,
This promise of paradise, this nearly was mine.
Close to my heart she came, only to fly away,
Only to fly as day flies from moonlight.
Now, now I'm alone, still dreaming of paradise,
Still saying that paradise once nearly was mine.",This Nearly Was Mine
Andy Williams,"I've traveled far
The land and the sea
Beautiful places
I happened to be

One little town
I'll never forget
Is Lourdes
The village of St. Bernadette

Ave, ave, ave, Maria
Ave, ave, ave, Maria

There, like a dream
This wonderful night
I gazed at the grotto
Aglow in the light

A feeling divine
Swept over me there
I fell to my knees
As I whispered the prayer

Ave, ave, ave, Maria
Ave, ave, ave, Maria

Now I am home
I'm happy to be
Telling of places
I've traveled to see

One little town
I'll never forget
Is Lourdes

Andy Williams,"Tonight, tonight, won't be just any night, 
Tonight there will be no morning star
Tonight, tonight, I'll see my love tonight.
And for us, stars will stop where they are. 

Today the minutes seem like hours, 
The hours go so slowly, 
And still the sky is light 

Oh moon, grow bright, 
And make this endless day endless night! 
Tonight

Today, the world was just an address
A place for me to live in
No better than alright

But here you are, 
and what was just a world is a star

Andy Williams,"Heavenly shades of night are falling, it's twilight time
Out of the mist your voice is calling, it's twilight time
When purple-colored curtains mark the end of day
I'll hear you, my dear, at twilight time

Deepening shadows gather splendor as day is done
Fingers of night will soon surrender the setting sun
I count the moments darling 'til you're here with me
Together at last at twilight time

Here, in the afterglow of day
We keep our rendezvous beneath the blue
Here in the sweet and same old way 
I fall in love again as I did then

Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me like days of old
Lighting the spark of love that fills me with dreams untold
Each day I pray for evening just to be with you
Together at last at twilight time

Together at last at twilight time",Twilight Time
Andy Williams,"Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch a long, lonely time
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much

Are you still mine?
I need your love, I need your love
God speed your love to me

Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh, ""Wait for me, wait for me
I'll be coming home, wait for me""

Are you still mine?
I need your love, I need your love
God speed your love to me

Our meetings are few and over too soon!
We speak in a whisper afraid to be heard
When people are near, we speak not a word!

Alone in our secret together we sigh
For one smiling day to be free!

To kiss in the sunlight and say to the sky
Behold and believe what you see,
Behold how my lover loves me!

Andy Williams,"From ages to ages the poets and sages,
Of love glorious love always sing,
But ask any lover and you'll soon discover,
The heartaches that romance can bring,

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone",When Your Lover Has Gone
Andy Williams,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Andy Williams,"When you walk through a storm hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark.
At the end of a storm is a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of a lark.

Walk on through the rain,
Tho' your dreams be tossed and blown.
Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone,
You'll never walk alone.",You'll Never Walk Alone
Andy Williams,"Younger than springtime are you
Softer than starlight are you
Warmer than winds of June
Are the gentle lips you gave me

Gayer than laughter are you
Sweeter than music are you
Sunlight and moon beans
Heaven and earth
Are you to give me
And when your youth and joy
Invade my soul
And fill my heart

Gayer than laughter am I

The wonderful loneliness
Of the headphone silence
Feels like no one can see me

They see right through me
Cuts me off
From the rest of the world

The useless strangers
Sharing my time and space
They might hear my humming
My tapping of fingers anyway
At least I have my thoughts all to myself
My content and the view outside

I see a rainbow complete
Resting its feet on the hill and the ground
Works as an illustration to the sound
This is a whole in time

A couple of hours when the day is
More abstract than usually
I star in this movie
I play the part and unify

I could be anywhere

Which fills my head",Headphone Silence

Makes a difference between you and me

And tell lies you never knew weren't true

Ane Brun,"I look in the mirror and
I am weaker than my reflection
This image is all I seek
As I restlessly wonder up a peek

So I turn it off and on again
Just like the shifting lights
Of day and night in my doorway

And the memories of everything
That's ever said and done
It makes it easier to leave it on

Monotony makes me weary
Assurance awakes destructiveness
As I lie in my diary
To justify the choices I make

Don't ever let me go, I will fall to the ground

At the time that we met we were whole
Then we peeled off piece by piece of our souls
We were wrong to stay this long
Let me go, let me fall to the ground

I'm waiting for you to disarm me
I'll go off if you don't remove this weight off of me
Then you called I love you so

I'll leave all disturbants at home, the evening papers and the telephone
But I'll bring my memories, despite everything I hope life will miss me

That there is a place where everything is on hold

And then I spoke I counted all of the good things you are

And that list of charms was longer than my chain of broken hearts
And when the day was done I figured I had already lost
From the start, from the start

I was gonna love you till the end of all daytime
And I was gonna keep all our secret signs and our lullabies
I was made to believe that our love would grow old

We were gonna live in a tree house and make babies
And we were gonna bury our ex-lovers and their ghosts
Baby we were made of gold

So many times we drank fine wine in one swallow
And in those late nights we painted our walls bright yellow

And that list of charms was longer than my chain of broken hearts
And when the day was done I figured I had already lost

We get so little but what we get it tastes so much
We're always longing for more

Is this the end of the thread?

Over something that started with wonder

This just won't hold, hold, hold, hold

And fell into a never ending moment
And the whisper from your mouth through mine
With those words that gently filled my lungs

I forget how am I to being lonely
Living without you
Spend another day passing by you
Don't wanna know how it feels if I do

Glitter box of dreams
Inside lie bitter pills
You know I never wanted
To sing for your lover
But the angels sang of love
And outside the night was falling

fly - fiery angels kiss the sky
Won't you shine your light down on me
Fly - through the blazing cosmic eye
No, you'll never know if you won't go

eleven ways to lose your mind
Seven ways to shine
Four doors that may take you in
One that's closed behind
I should have seen you leaving
But I never thought you'd go
No, I never thought you'd walk away

it's getting dark, too dark to see
And angel's a long time gone
Too many things I can't combine
With logic reason
How can I tell the black from white
If all is black and blue?
God knows where I'm going
When the keeper waves me through...

In the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean. 
So greatan area of land, That from her western shores 
Those beautifulsailors journeyed 
To the South and the North Americas with ease,
In their ships with painted sails. 
To them East Africa was aneighbour, Across a short strait of sea miles. 
The great Egyptian age is But a remnant of 
The Atlantian culture.

All the Gods who playin the mythological dramas In all legends from all lands were from far Atlantis. Knowing her fate, Atlantis sent out ships toall corners of the Earth. 
On board were the Twelve: The poet, the physician, The farmer, the scientist, The magician and the other so-called Gods of our legends. Though Gods they were - And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind Let us rejoice sing -dance and ring in the new age Hail Atlantis!

Un, deux ou trois lapins,
Quidams ! Je suis magicien !
Si je change la peste
En petits bouts de pain,
Ri-gue-dam ! Je suis diablotin !
See'est en suivant l'étoile do berger
Sans me soucier des mages
Que j'ai appris à faire voler
Ce que j'avais en cage.
Si tu as des ailes,
Ajoute deux mandibules,
Ri-gue-dam ! Tu es libellule !
Et j'engage le ciel
En guise de vestibule,
Ri-gue-dam ! Tu es funambule !
De fil en aiguille tu brises tes chaînes,
Tu construis un empire !
Range ton coeur dans un bas de laine,
Ca peut toujours servir !
Si j'ai dans la tête
Grelots et tambourins,
Quidams ! Je suis baladin !
Si je pars en quête
D'un feuillet de quatrains,
Ri-gue-dam ! Je suis mandarin !
A chaval sur le vent, je pars sur la lune
Avec mon sac de noix !
Je sais qu'ici bas j'étais sans fortune,
Là-haut je serai Roi !

Je suis Grimaud le Fou
Vis depuis deux mille ans
Aux crochets du néant

Petit fils d'Aphrodite
Cortège d'algues marines
Pénètrent mes clarines

Je suis Flo l'Écureuil
Noisettes que je cueille
Iront égratigner
Les semailles oubliées

Au delà de mon délire s'en vient l'aurore
Des matins bleus
Aux écureuils immaculés
Qui donnent festin dans mes cheveux

Au delà de mon sourire éclate une huitre
Gonflée de perles
Fixant mon jardin à l'Eden
Par son collier miraculeux

Au delà de mes soupirs, je n'entends plus
Le vent du Nord
Mimant à l'envers du décor
Les marionnettes de mes aïeux

Au delà de mon délire
J'irai bouffer la terre nouvelle
J'irai gifler mes ancêtres
Pour que vestiges ne repoussent plus

Je suis Maître Godevin

Ange,"Ils étaient tous réunis, le curé de la famille
Avait flanqué sa bedaine au confluent des cieux
Fermez les yeux, ces jeux ne sont pas pour les bons Dieux

Le faisan était déchiré, plumes s'en étaient allées
Couronner les lieux secrets de la belle baronne
Fermez les yeux, ces jeux ne sont pas faits pour les bons Dieux

Le valet de coeur posa ses mains de velours
Sur la fine fleur d'une dame de cour

¡Courez, buvez, chantez, le roi est mort ce matin!

Comme des millions de feu follets, le vin dégueulait des pichets
Pour venir tacher des robes qui n'en étaient plus
Fermez les yeux, ces jeux ne sont pas faits pour les bons Dieux

Nonchalamment le petit page ouvrit son livre d'images
Sous le pieu flamboyant du chat noir qui miaulait
Fermez les yeux, ces jeux ne sont pas faits pour les bons Dieux

Viens butiner mon bréviaire, abeille hérétique
De la première prière au dernier cantique

¡Courez, buvez, chantez, le roi est mort ce matin!

Troubadours, quittez vos tréteaux, les chevaux s'emballent
Il y a feu au château, c'est la fin du bal

¡Courez, buvez, chantez, le roi est mort ce matin!

Tu sais parler de nos aïeux comme s'ils n'avaient jamais été vieux!

Tu ressembles à ces chercheurs d'or qui auraient un secret de plus

Ta bouche est sucrée de légendes que l'on déguste comme un festin
Un festin qui n'est pas à vendre, mais qui se donne comme un matin...

Et quand l'hiver trompe l'automne se prenant pour un faux printemps
Tu nous parles d'une anémone poussée au coeur de tes vingt ans!

Aux marécages de ton passé j'irai offrir mes pieds honteux
J'auréolerai de tes années celles qui feront de moi un vieux!

Puisse cette ode rester à Emile au plus grand maréchal-ferrant
Puisse cette ode rester à Emile au petit vieux de tous les temps

Angel,"Love is being a chair that a tired man can sit on
Love is being a shade from the sun and heat to rest in
Love is being a soldier fighting for what you believe in
And love is giving
Love is being a fountain in a desert for you to drink from
Love is seeing a storm and offering protection
Love is the giving of both hands to catch the tears in motion
And love is open

-Chorus-
Love is deep as is wide, and taller than tall
Love is stronger than steal
Still the bad through it all
It's everything
A wounded hearts wing
Love is, Love is, Love is
All of those things

Love is being a candle that will chase away the darkness
Love is being a strangle to someone that is defense less
Love is praying for those who are searching for forgiveness
And love, love is children

-Chorus-
Love is deep as is wide, and taller than tall
Love is stronger than steal
Still the bad through it all
Well It's everything
A wounded hearts wing
Love is, Love is, Love is
All of those things

Ohhh wooowwoo yeahhh

Love is deep as is wide, and taller than tall
Love is stronger than steal
Still the bad through it all
Well It's everything

Angel,"Once upon a time you were mine
Haven't I heard this story
All these sugar sweet fairytales
Never come true and they bore me

I'm like goldilocks like it hot not too cold
Boy, I'm starving
Wake me with a kiss, make a wish
You can be my prince charming

Now is the time, I need you
Once upon my time, once upon your time
Once upon our time, this ain't no fairytale

You're good enough, I'll have you
Once upon my time, once upon your time
Once upon our time, this ain't no fairytale

Oh oh this ain't. No fairy tale hey, hey, hey, this ain't no fairy tale

Not so long ago, I was lost feeling like Cinderella
Just like little red riding hood
What a big tale I tell ya
I'm not snowy white, do me right
Give me that poison apple
Seven little men, make it ten!!

Round and round, round we go the story's end
You never get to it

We argue constantly bout how it's supposed to be
You say I'm paranoid and you put all the blame on me and it's the

Same old thing we're going over again and now I'm 
Starting to wonder if it's worth all the pain

I'll make it fancy with some wine and candlelight
And maybe, with the food
You're gonna find the mood
You'll see what it's all about
And g g g g get it out

But if you still don't say it 
Then you won't get my reprieve
I'm gonna have to pack my 
Bags and get up and leave

I didn't know it meant so much 
Well baby what a surprise

Here's whatcha gotta do,
Here's whatcha gotta say

Sitting by the door alone
She's left me once again,
Cheap wigs and long black hose.
It's an every night affair,
With someone new she says
I've lost my taste for toys
I bring joys to little boys.

She puts on her brand new face
Her baby blues and long white lace
She turns to hug and hold me tight
Whatever soothes me in my fright.
She's gonna soon be leaving town,
With some other man she's found
She tells me I'm a big boy now,
And just be a little, little proud.

Mother can't you hear when I plead??

Broken hearts and broken dreams,
Are what I've made my life it seems

So that's what I'm taught and told
I can't explain the pains I hide
No matter how I try and try
Everything I do seems wrong,
Ever since the day I was born.

Mother can't you see what I need??
Mother can't you hear when I plead??

Wipe the tears away from my face,
As I turned and walked from that place
Leave my past behind without a trace

Seems I might have cried too loud
It took too long to see

I tell myself that things will change.

But you see, when I wake up from my dreaming,

It's still the same, I can't believe you've gone away.

I look for words to bring you back.

Can't you see, it won't let go of me,

Got to learn, it's easy to forget you.

Words won't stop the pains I have inside,

Got to change the feelings that I hide.

And now the only thing left to do, is to tell ya, the only way I ever knew, now listen man...

And still I haven't a date.
Waiting by the moon,
Sipping Whiskey sours.
I'll think I'll wait here 'till noon.
It really could be days,
'Til I find some flowers,
So I'll send you a bouquet.

Chorus 1:
Uptown, run around, hear the sound, of the city streets below,
And people in a rush everywhere.
No rain, sugar cane, just a grain,
In my champagne glass, you know.
You put that magic touch in the air.

So they say, it's closing time again,
Funny how time passes,
Through a bottle of Champagne.
The only sound I hear, is that of rattling glasses,
And people laughing in my ear.
You've taken far too much, since you left for Paris,
You've got that magic touch.

Uptown, run around, hear the sound, of the city streets below,
And the people rush everywhere.

I only hear my radio.
I look around me,

Though I just can't tell,
So I'll start another book.
Seems I've read them all,
I guess I'll make a call,
Or tune to the news.

Chorus:
People runnin' 'round they ask to talk awhile
They say you're lookin' fine but you just smile
You may be fooling someone but you're not fooling me.

Everything's the same,
Seems I need a change,
I'm slipping back into a daydream.
By my window,
I catch the falling snow,
But then watch the late-late show.

you show the world your broken heart.

how I got to feeling like I do.

For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay
There's always one reason
To feel not good enough
And it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction
Oh, beautiful release
Memory seeps from my veins
Let me be empty
And weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

In the arms of an angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort there

So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
And the storm keeps on twisting
You keep on building the lie
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference
Escaping one last time
It's easier to believe, in this sweet madness, oh
This glorious sadness, that brings me to my knees

In the arms of an angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort there

You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

I pulled myself right out of bed.
Right outside my window,
The rain was fallin' hot as lead.
So I drank a pint of rum,
'Till rushed up to the top of my head.
Then lookin' kinda pale,
I drank a glass of ale again.

Lift a toast to the past,
Drink to the future at last.
Then fill another glass,
'Cause it's comin' up much too fast.

Now runnin' through the streets,
Lookin' for some hospitality.
I found the nearest inn,
Asn I had a fifth of gin sent to me.
When I saw a small dispute,
Over girls of ill repute, naturally.
Then the lights went out,
And I took a subtle hint to leave.

Encourages their evil deeds

I feel my mind
Is leaving me
I will follow into eternity

A light shines on me
I feel the sun arise
Fire will banish my fear
My dreadful
Black dreams
No longer they'll
Scare me
Until the night returns

How long can I stand
The return of
The eternal curse
Deliver me of all the pain
The fear of the dusk
Paralyzes me

I feel my mind
Is leaving me
I will follow into eternity

A light shines on me
I feel the sun arise
Fire will banish my fear
My dreadful
Black dreams
No longer they'll
Scare me
Until the night returns

Black is the jail of my soul
In my haunted nights

Fire will banish my fear

Angel Dust,"For me and I
Live seems so hard at all
Not even worth a dime
Need to do some kind of crime

I'm looking up
To a high command
But watching you tears me in two
To sell myself I got to do

There's no return now
If I want to go my way
To leave this life of a dying man
I would sell my soul to anyone

Here I am, an eternal slave
I will do what you like
I will be at your side, I'm alright
I would die to be your friend

Fly away to the other side
Fly away to the point of entry
Fly away to what's so high above
Will you establish me

In your company?
Oh please
I'll be forever yours
Seems I am none, but I'm sure I'll be one

There's a place for me too
Just tell me what to do",Fly Away
Angel Dust,"I need you
I'll lead you
I'll thrill you
I'll kill you

I'll lead you out of the night
That once has fallen upon us
Revenge for the stab with a dagger
Right into our shieldless back

Do you agree when I say expulsion?
Do you agree to wipe them out?
Do you mind the voice of the world?
Or will you follow each command?

One heart, one soul
One man to lead you into your
Salvation, domination,
We can rule the world forever

I need you - like the air I'm breathing day by day
I'll lead you - my lambkins, my dear children
I'll thrill you - I'm the twilight of the gods
I kill you - as I will die for you

Now you believe every word I say
Now you're puppets in my hands
Do you remember, I'd asked you once
If you will follow me even into death

Now, here's your ultimate chance
To take your oath, you've sworn on me
Don't pray to God for he is dead
A new Messiah has caputred your minds

One folk, one lord
One man to lead you into your
Salvation, extermination
We will change the world forever

I'm your leadeer, I'm your lord
Am I human or divine?",I Need You
Angel Dust,"It's a tragedy, that's coming near
Hatred chains our thoughts, born in fear
Makes our children be martyrs of vanity
Sacrifice in another gods name

We speak of love and mercy 
While only bullets answering every thrown stone
We praise our lord in heaven
But all our deeds are by blood and pain

Let's lay down our swords now
And let the blood dry now
It's not our destiny to be enemies
There can be a tomorrow
So let the blood dry now
No war can last forever

Time of killing lasts for so many years
Life lights burn so fast, all that's left are tears
Do you really believe our gods want us to kill?
Not one word of our belief tells this is out lords will

Time runs fast for you and me
But still our souls can be saved by the glory of love
Take the hand that reaches out for you
Let's end the madness before it's too late, too late

Solitary sister, is there still a part of you that wants to give

Your walk, your talk, even your smile
Keepin' my attention focused just on you
I wonder if you're here alone
Or if you have a girl at home
Tell me I just wanna know
Then you turned around
And gestured to your boys
Like you were rollin' out
So I said

Hey you, hey you, hey you
I don't know your name
But I'd really like to know
Hey you, hey you, hey you
I don't know your name
But wouldn't you like to go

Somewhere to grab a bite to eat
So we can talk in privacy
And learn a bit about your personality
The huntress captured by the game
Cause my intentions weren't the same
No I'm not tryin' to take you home
So as you walk out
Say your name again
It's so hard to pronounce
So I said

Hey you, hey you, hey you
I don't know your name
But I'd really like to know
Hey you, hey you, hey you
I don't know your name
But wouldn't you like to go

Out to see a movie
I think that that would be real groovy
I know I'm sounding kinda loony
Cause that's what I like
Cause I like people watchin'
Here I go again
I see something I like
So I say

Hey you, hey you, hey you
I don't know your name

Hey you, hey you, hey you
I don't know your name
But wouldn't you like to go",Hey You
Angel Grant,"There was a time
When I knew nothing about love
A silly little girl
Masking her feelings from the world
You bring me so much joy
And I thank God from up above
Right now I know that what I'm feeling is true love
I love you
I love you

[Chorus]
I never thought that I could feel this way
I never thought that we would go all the way
I never thought that I could form my lips to say
I love you
I love you
I love you

Since you've gone away the days are long
And my love grows stranger
I can't hide these tears
And yet my heart it grows fonder
The love I feel for you is like a child on Christmas day
You taught me how to love and just how to communicate
That's why I sing this song to you and to only you
I love you
I love you

[Chorus]

Love that brings me joy
It feels so natural
Innocent and pure so unconditional
So emotional

And the sun shines
And the trees rock side to side
And the rain begins to fall
It's cause you're not here

When the night falls
And there's darkness
And the stars light up the sky
'Cause the moor refuses to shine
It's cause you're not here

There'll be no reason for you and I
How I wish that I could fly
And be free as a butterfly

Here's tomorrow without promise
Just another day gone by
There's no hope for you and I
It's cause you're not here
When I'm lonely and I'm crying
Feelin' sorry for myself
I don't want nobody else

Holes in head, hands, feet, and weep for me.

On top of that green like grass ass
That’s over y'all head like snapbacks
I get it where I fit in, put up then I put in
Tryna find an ass I can put my fucking foot in
Run this shit no I run this shit
Don’t give one fuck bitch I done this shit
I did what I say I did
Did not fabricate one bit
I have been the fucking realest since my exit near the clit'
That’s where I was born fuck what you on
All about me bitch fuck what you doin'
Round of applause bitches happy with some garbage
Show my whole fucking ass like a fat bitch in chaps
But I’ll be running that shit like a motherfuckin' tracker
Like I run on sense like a motherfuckin' chopper
Like a cheetah in the jungle but I’m motherfucking faster
Like a pre-teen boy in the church with a pastor
Hold up I’m not serious I’m just playin' psych
Fuck your opinion bitch I mean it when I’m sayin' that

Money and more money is the only shit I’m after
You can cut the fake shit
I’m not a motherfuckin' actor
I’m on top of my green like a motherfucking tractor
You niggas you ‘bout to be bitches you bitches 'bout to be Casper

I’ll be on that other shit got that from my other bitch
She come from an island or a desert or some tundra shit
I am multi-faceted, bitch I do a ton of shit
Like I’m diarrhea or whatever sitting under it
I’m nasty, I’m insane, I’m too much, I spit grains
I came from the fuckin’ bottom
I’m top now, I shift lanes,

Like no shit, like oh shit

My tongue is the fucking rapture, bitch
I be at my peak, I am not the one to be mastered
I’m the one to be after, I’m sweeping you while I’m dusting
I just popped up out the blue, I’m spontaneously combusting
Spit a little different, give me just a minute
Beat the beat down bitch, fresh it then I kill it
We are not the same but they don’t really get it
Tell ‘em do the math, hoe, fraction, division
Sick flow sick ho, drop me in the clinic
Eat 'em 'til the end 'til they back at the beginning
Cause I ki-ki-ki-kill it ‘til it’s flat dead
And never pass a rock like a motherfucking crackhead

See this is for the moments when ya alone and with emotion
So fucking bold leaves you mentally frozen
When ya cold and alone heart open and broken
When that loves outta sight and your hearts into focus
When ya floating in oceans hopeless soaking in misery
Headphones on you link yourself with the synergy
When you watch your mind and ya lost in a song, be strong
You are not alone, I just want you to know you are not alone

There's angels in the airwaves tonight
And I've been running all of my life
And I need you to stay, I need you to stay
Angels in the airwaves tonight

This for all the moments when your weakness is your cloak
And people you love most just beat you to a pulp
When you cut open your wrist looking for loving in the slits
But find nothing but self hate cause nothing exists
See this for all the moments when they don't understand
And they ain't where you stand
And they can't comprehend
They just staring from the outside
And then they judging your in, when they
Kick you and beat you and hurt you then leave you
Laying on the ground like you half of they equal
Gladly defeat you then laugh to your face
When you feel all alone, when ya so outta place
They can't relate to this pain
They don't feel how I feel

When the guy you like adds you to his fucking collection
When you all dressed in black
And they whisper and snicker
And they make you feel wrong for being so different
This for everybody who knows what it is
To feel like nothing but a memory that won't be relived
That distant fucking shit that everyone forgets
The words on the tip of tongues that gets swallowed with the spit
See I know how it feels
I've been there before
I had head in my hands and my heart on the floor
I've been worthless and shattered
I've been nothing to people
I know what it is to have to force them to see you

So don't get lost tonight
Never let the ignorance cost ya life
You can make it, keep ya fingers crossed tonight

Dead skin on the flesh of your halo
Drunk love on the breath of an angel
Time frozen in the ash from your blunt
And you breathe like you had life trapped in your lungs
And you wanted escape, and I wanted to take
Every thought from your mind and just throw it away
As I've watered you've grown
I've deflowered your soul
You a seed that I planted with a thought of a rose
And I thought I'd impose if I ever had the energy
And I would save somebody if I ever had the memory
I cleared up some space and invited you in
You were brown and I tried to make you violet again
And I brought out the sun and the violence of wind
And I tore off your thorns and they died in my skin
Yeah
And I watched you, become beautiful
It's funny what the dirt does, when it's suitable

I don't mind being April's fool
The flowers came when the rain made you
Honest hours having spent with few
But I'll be April's fool for you and

I'm April's fool
And a rose grew from the concrete with a heartbeat
And I took you to the grass and made its bed
Then I bathed you in my love until it sprouted
And I'll never get the thought out of my head
I'm April's fool

Yo
Freeze frame cause the view is so cinematic
And the opening to you was so hemorrhagic
But my first mistake was thinkin it was easy
And that you'd love me if I really let you see me
Deep thoughts in the abyss of your brain cells
One shot to wherever your pain's held
And it became something I'd never seen before
And now my heart too small to beat for anything but yours
Though my perception's is varied as your shade change
And the burdens gettin heavier than weight gain
And we kept swallowing the sun until the shade came
And kept on knockin on the clouds until we made rain
All the flowers in the garden share the same range
And a rose by any color share the same name
But I love you in a way that will not cease
'Cause you're hideous in ways I cannot see

I don't mind being April's fool
The flowers came when the rain made you
Honest hours having spent with few
But I'll be April's fool for you and

I'm April's fool
If we take the flowers stem and walk into the rainbow
Remember to water them and watch how quickly they grow
But as quick as clouds come in and drown them in the rain so
We can take the potters and anoint them with the same ho
And a rose grew from the concrete with a heartbeat

Then all of a sudden it's like spontaneous combustion
And I'm all up in your face yellin', ""Bitch, you can't tell me nothin'""
'Cause I came from the bottom, now everybody's watchin'
I said it was my time, now I'm who everybody's glockin'
And I'm just out here sprintin', I'm runnin' right through my vision
I'm trying to outrun my past, but still trying to defeat my limits
'Cause you only get one moment in this life to be great
And you give it your all despite what it takes
And you never let 'em kill you, you take everything they give you
And throw it right fuckin' at 'em and tell 'em it doesn't build you
And no it don't ever break you, and no it can't overtake you
Life's like a bed of roses, you take the thorns and you make do
Sometimes you have to hurt for the 'cause to be reached
But one day you'll be stronger then all that you beat
And you can say

Money cannot buy
All the love that's here tonight
All the love that's here tonight
Ooh ooh
There's just you and I
So lift your hands toward the sky
Lift your hands toward the sky
Ooh ooh

I woke up one Sunday morning, stopped believing in Jesus
Stopped believing in churches, I stopped believing in preachers
I realized I was a teacher, not just one of the heathens
I'm born to destroy the fallacies, stop creating believers
Start creating the leaders, tell 'em who they should follow
Nobody but themselves, especially if they hollow
Especially when they empty and death reserves for fulfillment
You the only person alive who holds the key to your healin'
So you take it and you run with it
And keep going even when your suns hidden
Because the time we spend in darkness when the rain comes
Is where we often find the light soon as the pain's done
There ain't material things in the world
That can change the fact that you feel lonely
Despite the fact that it gets hard, you take it all and you still go
Take the sun and you still grow, lose the light and you still glow
I been there, I'm still here and I know how you feel, so

Money cannot buy
All the love that's here tonight
All the love that's here tonight
Ooh ooh
There's just you and I
So lift your hands toward the sky
Lift your hands toward the sky
Ooh ooh

We don't wanna fight
So sing with me our battle cry
Sing with me our battle cry
Ooh ooh
Money cannot buy
All the love that's here tonight
All the love that's here tonight
Ooh ooh

It's hard to explain my way of living to people who never lived it
A minute in my position filled with my opposition
That anybody not different fighting to stay the same
I got lives in my hands and I'm fighting to make 'em change
Couldn't accept responsibility, find somebody to blame
The emotions that I'm harboring 'bout to drive me insane
Tried to say fuck everything, but I ain't have the heart to
Rarely had the heart to do a lot of things I ought to
So now I spit it for people who say their cords missing
Inspire life into anybody that's forfeiting
'Cause it's easy to keep pretending that there's nothing wrong
But it's harder to keep their head up and be fucking strong
So, now they telling me ""go, Haze, they can't stop you
Heavyweight flow, if they can't lift you then they can't drop you
The pinnacle, if they can't reach you then they can't top you
Man, they can't do anything that you're about to""

Money cannot buy
All the love that's here tonight
All the love that's here tonight
Ooh ooh
There's just you and I
So lift your hands toward the sky
Lift your hands toward the sky
Ooh ooh

We don't wanna fight
So sing with me our battle cry
Sing with me our battle cry
Ooh ooh
Money cannot buy
All the love that's here tonight

Angel Haze,"You should write a song where the concept is…
You’re basically writing like a love letter, or like a piece of advice
To your mother, when she was your age

I don’t know
Maybe I would write you a happy ending
I would rearrange the pieces to your sad beginning
I would put you far away from the decaying roots that bore you
And let you experience all the ways that happiness could bloom before you
Or maybe I’m naïve…
Maybe I’m just a kid who thought that if she could plant a seed
It would somehow grow inside you

Spent so much of my time wishing you were different
But reality is that with life can't never be provision
But if I could wish for one thing, I’d go back and I’d fix it
I’d tackle all your obstacles and kill 'em with precision
And better the intentions of every single person
Who'd play a part in you learning exactly what your worth is
I’d shower you with purpose, I’d wipe hate off the surface
I’d reshape all your pain and make it fucking worth it
No more feeling worthless, no more fucking searching
No more of that fraud shit, nobody else could hurt you
Yeah, said nobody else could hurt you
And if they ever tried too I’d wipe 'em from the Earth too
Cuz I know that you hurting baby, I know that you tired too
I know that you been running from everything that’s behind you
I know you’ve been burying everything deep inside you
I can see it killing you, wish that I could revive you
But I’m stuck sitting in this time frame
Struggling with my demons and playing these stupid mind game
One day it could get better, maybe it could get better
Maybe we could change shit, no more inclement weather
Know you hated your mom, know it went through your mind
You were just like me, wish that you had more time
To see life from a different angle, wrestle with a different angel
Wouldn’t lose your wings and fall from heaven like a cliffhanger

Everything is different now, nothing is the same
And nowadays I swear it feels like you don’t know my name
But I look at the mirror and I see you every day
I’m you in every way, every hue and every shade
And maybe you should know, it’s the last thing that I wanted
Cuz what I hate about you makes me feel like I’m haunted
And I don’t wanna spend the rest of my time on the run and-
So I’m just gonna confront it, yeah I’m just gonna confront it
And tell you that I love you for everything you made me
And that you need to hear this even if it makes you angry
God lives inside you, you’ve already found him
The Devil lives in memories and you just let him hound you
And I despise your church for every fucking thing they taught you
It’s just a fucking stain that I wish I could wipe off you
That I wish I could wipe off you
And I forgive you for doing everything that it cost you
Everything that it caused price I wish it didn’t cost you
Losing a part of me that would follow you to Hell
Follow you to hatred, or follow you to jail
Followed you to patterns that I could never get out of
Now I realize that I could never make it with that love
Now I realize that shit is the alternative outcome
Never wanted you to save me, I just wish I count some
I just wish that you grew up with someone you could count on
I wish you knew that you could never make it without love
For your goddamn self, and that you never ever find it in anybody else
Cuz I would help you find you
And if I saw it killing you I swear I would revive you
And if that meant the end of me
I’d do it all for you so you could have your happy end in peace

Because, you are such a special thing
You’re not just my mom, but you’re the reason I exist
And the best life that you could’ve had for yourself without making a mistake
Would have meant I woulda had a nicer childhood
And even though my childhood wasn’t perfect and I still love you
I just want you to know that if I could go back and do one thing for you
Or be one person for you
I would make sure, not just for my sake, but so that you could’ve had a nicer life
And a nicer childhood, that you know
You would not have made the mistakes that put us all in this bad situation
And not have the strength to leave
But just so that you would have been happier and stronger
Even if I didn’t exist, even it meant that I was never born
That’s what I would have wanted for you

Yeah, and if that meant the end of me
I’d do it all for you so you could have your happy ending
Cuz I know that you hurting baby, I know that you tired too
I know you’ve been running from everything that’s behind you
I know that you’ve been burying everything deep inside you
I can see it killing you, wish that I could revive you
And if that meant the end of me
I’d do it all for you so you could have your happy ending
And if that meant the end of me
I’d do it all for you so you could have your happy ending
And if that meant the end of me
I’d do it all for you so you could have your happy ending

I don’t know
Maybe I would write you a happy ending
I would rearrange the pieces to your sad beginning
I would put you far away from the decaying roots that bore you
And let you experience all the ways that happiness could bloom before you
Or maybe I’m naïve…
Maybe I’m just a kid who thought that if she could plant a seed
It would somehow grow inside you
And that I could hide you from the rain
So that it could be easier for happiness to find you
Or maybe I’m still a kid who’s caught in a dream
I’m the heir to the throne of a princess who’s still trying to be queen
Or maybe we’re all just caught in the winds of a massacre

Angel Haze,"""And the light, the lighAnnotatet can make everything feel beautiful. It can make it feel safe, so safe that, like, in the night, we spend all of our time running away from our truths. And then we meet someone who tells us, 'God will always love you, no matter what you do. The only thing that will never stop loving you is God.' And because of all of our darkness—which at night I still run from, which at night we all still run from, we get stuck chasing light. That's a Black Synagogue.""

""And God said that the meek shall inhabit the Earth! But there shall be masses, I said masses!, of bloodshed first!

Save me from the pain
I'm falling down
Don't you hear me calling?
I need you now
Fill me 'til I'm whole with your holy light
Give me sanction
Can you bring me back to life?

Save me from the pain
I'm falling down
Don't you hear me calling?
I need you now
Fill me 'til I'm whole with your holy light
Give me sanction
Can you bring me back to life?

I been running from the pain in my brain
Got stains on my scene while I search for the real me
Search for the real me, lost in the night
Only talk to angels when I'm lost in a height
I don't really wanna get lost in my mind
So I pray until I feel I'm getting lost in the vibe
Then I took the bottle up and I drink it to my what?
Yep, drink it to my fucking soul's lost in my eyes
But I don't really wanna drown no, 'cuz I'm not that trusting
But I'ma keep coming 'round though, till I'm sure that I found something
And when I tell you what it is, you better talk to God, remember
No feelings, no thoughts allowed
And if pain's a trapdoor then I need God
And so send someone to come walk me out
But don't think, don't talk about it
Wait, don't sing, don't tell nobody
Wait, don't drink, don't fail your body
Wait, don't scream, no, fucking shout it
See, these voices in my head are the fucking loudest
So belligerent, so fucking rowdy
And my tunnel vision's so fucking clouded
And I don't really have a motherfucking outlet
So, I talk to God, but I don't really know if He can hear me
But you know Him well, and I think that you could bring Him near me
So I keep praying, every word that I keep saying
Every part of me that I needed shield from
Every part of me that needs saving

Save me from the pain
I'm falling down
Don't you hear me calling?
I need you now
Fill me 'til I'm whole with your holy light
Give me sanction
Can you bring me back to life?

None of this's real, when it calls you
Thought I found you, now I'm lost too
I've been listening to service sermons
A lotta redefining, a lot of words reworded
A lotta thoughts detected and thoughts suggested
A lotta stuff that resonates with certain persons
I've been searching for the truth but it's embedded in lies
Read every single verse until I'm red in my eyes
And God'll only hear you when you offering ties
And protection is the truth
But when the Devil's a lie
But what am I to do when the Devil is I?
And everything I touch seems to shrivel and die?
My mama always said I was a rebel inside
But now I'm looking for some peace and a benevolent I
And how it feels to need that, some humbling pie
And how long it will take when it comes from the sky
Means I'll probably be waiting until I crumble and die
And just wrestling with Satan while I'm struggling by
So, I think, I talk about it
Wait, I drink, I tell somebody
Wait, I sink, I fail my body
Wait, I scream, I'm fucking shouting
Cause these voices in my head are the fucking loudest
So belligerent, so fucking rowdy
And my tunnel vision's so fucking clouded
And I don't really have a motherfucking outlet
So, I talk to God, but I don't really know if He can hear me
And you know him well, and I think that you could bring him near me
So I keep praying, everything that I keep saying
Every part of me that I needed shield from
Every part of me that needs saving

Save me from the pain
I'm falling down
Don't you hear me calling?
I need you now
Fill me 'til I'm whole with your holy light
Give me sanction
Can you bring me back to life?

Did he die on the cross for this?
Do you have any fucking proof?
Everything here is man-made
And I'm just searching for some fucking truth
Cause everything they ever told me not to do
Has always made me question what freedom is
Why listen to the words when they not from you?
And why feel judged when I freely live?
Now I know what the fucking root of evil is
And why peace is dead, but evil lives
Everybody thinking they can talk to you
And what they believe in they hearts are true
Now they feel that they had the right to persecute
Judge, doom to hell and come first to you
Now I don't really know who wrote the Bible
But nothing under the sun goes unrecycled
Take every shot you have with a fucking rifle
Cause you rarely ever get a chance for revival
So, just think, just talk about it
Wait, just think, just tell somebody
Wait, don't blink, don't fail your body
Wait, just scream, just fucking shout it
So the voices in your head fall abruptly silent
And the blood in your veins flows rough and violent
And you see everything with your lifted eyelids
And every burden you carry is eventually lighted
And you talk to God, even when you ain't sure he hears you
And you give it to Him, tell Him, He can keep the pain and fears too
And you keep praying, only now you don't repeat sayings
Cuz you know when you let it go, then you receive Satan

""How many people here look for Jesus to solve their problems? Lots of people. And how many of those people are fixed? None of them know fucking about shit, they're all fucking fucked up. Anything to help you escape. It takes it, it takes something to just say, 'Fuck it! This is reality, I'm gonna deal with it!' But do we ever really deal with it? Deal with it, stop running, stop trying to find these substitutes? Stop trying to find Jesus in strangers, and Jesus in church, and God, and find God in yourself. Powerful thing, yeah?""",Black Synagogue

Brave covered in pity
Lights smother this city
I pray he doesn't forget me
I pray he doesn't forget me that lonely night in november
When we fell into the hands of the coldest day in december
Then became the product of the trust that we had lost and found
Got you deep in the emotion just to watch you drown
And I had never left the land’s sand
'Cause I was busy building castles for a dead man
Shouldn't have taken my eyes of you
I shouldn't have straddled the lines crossed too
And now I've been searching but can't find you
Hence me being lost since you're the one I'm entwined to
So; is love the picture that we’ve tainted now?
No; Am I still with you when I ain't around?
Am I the subject you tip-toe or walk around?
And if this love is on the ledge I’m trying to talk it down

So, instead of sailing I live like a human parachute
The more I'm falling the further I am compared to you
It's like I'm stuck in the air while you're pale and blue
Chasing clouds and hoping they lead a trail to you
See, we were deep sea divers
And I was focused on survival
And death does you part when you're focused on its rival
Defibrillator love, I'm just focused on revival
You could, you could put your hands in mine
And we'll walk through the sand, in the sands of time
Until we paint the end of this love scene
Until I'm laid to rest in your blood stream
Until I hear the strings of your heart playing
Until I hear the things you are not saying
Until I find out what it really means
And hopefully it's everything it really seems

Angel Haze,"Take a breath, say you love me
We both know that everything changes

Keep in mind that none of this is fiction
This is just a glimpse into the head of a menace
We were two different children
But we born of the same moon
Blowing entire opposite
We were brought up the same too
I used to hate you because they celebrate you
And you made them notice every single thing I can’t do
But really I honestly wanted to be you
And I just hope my desire to wasn’t that see through
I never took into account the things that you were hiding
I even understood your rage when I see you get violent
I guess the height of all my envy was leaving me blinded
Until you sat me down and told me how crazy your life is
You said to run and never look back
And if I did, to never lose track of all the hurdles I was jumping
That lead me to my current goal

Don’t sell your soul baby you are dirty gold
Don’t sell your soul baby you are dirty gold
Don’t sell your soul baby you are dirty gold

Took a chance, said you’d love me
We both know that everything changes

You found me when I was dying and unappreciated
You broke me down into a science that I completely hated
You told impeccable talent didn’t make me less average
But how I use it to my advantage determined my passion
It took some time to understand and manage
But then I learned this passion was the method to my madness
And I never got to thank you, at least not in the way I planned
But I had to learn before I did that, I hope you understand
It takes a lot for me to bury hatchets but consider them cremated
All the ashes burned to ashes
And I’m dusting off my vocal box and finally saying thank you
And even though you ain’t my fan, you did the shit they ain’t do
So disregard my temper and the times I fucking hate you
Because despite all my ignorance I’m really fucking grateful
Never forget the importance of the sparks you hold

Don’t sell your soul baby you are dirty gold
Don’t sell your soul baby you are dirty gold
Don’t sell your soul baby you are dirty gold

Took a glance, towards the mirror
Now I know that everything changes

I used to hate me, I swore my life was too painful
Let my demons overtake me before I fight with my angels
There was constantly a struggle to see my life at an angle
That provided understanding of how much drama could change you
I used to cut myself open just to feel like I was living
But when living is just dying then there’s no longer a difference
There’s no longer existence, and there’s no longer persistence
And there’s no longer a drive there existing on only division
And I thought, if nobody ever loved me
This vacancy inside me must be really called a bloodstream
Then I looked into the world and saw a million people like me
Probably never know your stories, but you’re the reason I’m fighting
You’re the reason I’m writing; music
Could be so reviving
And if ever you tend to forget, I’m right here to remind you:
Don’t ever give into the hurt you hold

Don’t sell your soul baby you are dirty gold
Don’t sell your soul baby you are dirty gold",Dirty Gold

Don’t try to fix me when you know you’re just as broken
Don’t tell me that I’ll be okay

Using messages bottled to the pits of my womb
And I thought that in the midst of me dyin' you found a cure for me
And magnetize your vibrance and finally had a pull on me
I pictured you running to everywhere you would need to go
I’m up in the air, still running from everything below
Yo, I’m not sure what this is but I’ve got jet fuel in my soul

Swallowed my secrets like a bitter pill
Repeat the same mistakes so wounds will never heal
You know the reason I can’t look you in your eyes
But I want your guilty body like you love my dirty mind

We’ll fly
And I would never see you wrong so try
And when everything is gone then I
Will be wherever you reside
With my eyes full of passion
Desire running behind it
I don’t know what that means
But I’m sure we’ll find out together
When the good feels bad and the tunnel feels like forever
And hearts slow sink like a birds’s lost feather
The end all, be all, the pulling to a lever

Keep running baby here you can be what you like
Keep running baby til you find yourself tonight
Keep running baby: spread your wings and fly

Planes fly
Bewind the skies like faded faith
And I’ve tried to live my life at my own pace
But we lose so much time here on the ground
So it’s now
Take your flight or burn it down

Planes fly
High enough to take us anywhere
And we’ll go
We'll hear no, breathe no, see no fear
And I know
Trouble will find wherever we are
Keep wishing easy baby

I got all the scars, I can show it
Never been exempt, but the funny thing is, never really had friends
Just a bunch of down bitches only down for the moment
All of this shit don't end
I lost so much just to win
And that how it goes? Lord knows, I got holes in my soul

But I dreamt of the top, of the sky, dreams of gettin' high
Now everything I say, they gon' feel it
Every words I lay, they gon' hear it
Every single word, they gon' get it
(Let me make sure they remember me)
I tried, it was hard, but I did it
Couple more scars, but I'm livin'
Soon they'll never forget it, never ever forget it, never forget it
(Let me make sure they remember me)
All just survival of the fittest
All just to rhyme for the critics
Everything I want, Imma get it

Angel Haze,"""I remember being asked a lot, by a lot of different writers, zines, and shit, like, 'Why don't you incorporate your race, your ethnicity, where you've grown up, into your music?' I don't identify with that shit, like, my identity is the music, everything you need to know about me is in the music: my home, it's where I originate, it's where I fall apart, it's where I come to life.""

Back in the booth let the tragedy in
Switched up the team, let the magic begin
Told all you haters, I'm in it to win
Way back when them losers wasn't letting me in
All of these bitches is mad at me, so?
Money appeared now they magically foe
Honestly really can't pay it no mind
Because spending that time means I'd rather be broke
I'm out here living my passions and more
Witnessing peace as it pass through my soul
Nothing can irritate masses like literally showing them stagnance can turn into growth
Haters gon hate when you winning this shit
Done for these bitches, they tend to forget
I'm out here yelling 'bitch, look at me now!'
I was underground, now I'm stuck in the clouds
14 whole hours, a trip out to Spain
High in the clouds, bitch I'm gulping the rain
Just a year later still fucking these haters
While facing my fears, no more running from pain
Head is on straight so I'm gunning with aim
No more fucking with bitches who stunting for fame
You can catch me out roofless in something deranged
Ain't it funny how suddenly something can change?

You gotta make a decision to be the one difference in your life
And turn it around
Turn it around, turn it around
Even when you feel you dumbing it down

You gotta make a decision to be the one difference in your life
And turn it around
Turn it around, turn it around
Even when you feel you dumbing it down

Back when the preacher said change is to come
All nonbelievers prepare to be sonned
Not talking Jesus but honest to God
I bet I reach my prime before air leaves my lungs
Switched it up bitches, adjusted my flow
Go against me and get wrecked from the go
All of you bitches keep taking your shots
But if one come at me, then it's straight for your throat
Harder than nipples on bitches aroused
Deity swag and omnipotent style
Don't fuck with my bread and don't fuck with my head
Cause if it get to that point then I'm seriously vile
Promise you people that evil's alive
Wish you could see what I see with my eyes
All of the demons that be in mind
So I burned all my bridges and cut all my ties
Said I would do this back when I was 9
Said I would do this before I got signed
Said I would give all these lost kids and doubters
A reason and purpose to question their lives
Look where I am and then look where I've been
Tell me that I ain't destined to win
Never give power to none of you cowards
To tell me what you think my destiny is

You gotta make a decision to be the one difference in your life
And turn it around
Turn it around, turn it around
Even when you feel you dumbing it down

You gotta make a decision to be the one difference in your life
And turn it around
Turn it around, turn it around
Even when you feel you dumbing it down

Gone for a minute but back on my grind
Promise you you are no match for my mind
Took all my doubt, whipped it into submission
And forced my ambition to step into line
I know that they do not want me to shine
I know that they do not want me to climb
I know inside that being a boss means making these bitches get back on their jobs
Can anyone fuck with me now? No
How do these bitches respond? Don't
Looking behind to seeing me now
What do they think I'm beyond? Dope
I've just be taking my time, slow
Being alone in my mind, flow
Putting the contents of all that's inside me into this shit I'm designed for
Crossover, pivot, I'm back in the game
NASCAR on bitches, I'm tracking my lane
Focused on bridging the gap
And showing the youth all the ways to accomplish their dreams
Know how it feels when they kicking you down
And it's getting you down
You gotta make the decision to be the one difference in your life and turn it around

Turn it around, turn it around
Even when you feel you dumbing it down
I know it's hard to be adamant, too
When you stand out like a sore thumb in the crowd
No niggas and bitches and quitters aloud
Ball inside you until the survival of your dreams
Until you are living them out
Turn it around, turn it around
Even when you feel you dumbing it down
You gotta make a decision to be the one difference in your life
And turn it around
Turn it around, turn it around
Even when you feel you dumbing it down
You gotta make a decision to be the one difference in your life
And turn it around",A  Tribe Called Red

It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard

Pulling your puzzles apart

No me puedo imaginar mi amor 
lo tonto y  lo cruel que fui
Poseo lo de tu corazón

In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing

Out of the sky, I close my eyes

Angel Olsen,"My watch is blurry when I look down at my hands
I'm just another, alive with impossible plans
I turn the lights low but we both know where we are
And when it's over, what becomes of your pure heart?

A love that never seems to curse or to confine
Will be forever never lost or too defined
To lose the feeling of an endless searching through
How to have made what is never about me or you
That is the kind of love I'd always dreamed to be
However painful, let it break down all of me

From the sleeping life I lead
All the colors I have seen

The brighter one in front of me
Oh, the truth I thought I learned
And then it finally came along
Turned around and then it's there

I want to follow
My heart down that wild road

Everywhere I go
I can see your face
Alive and gone at once
Hey, that's the way I see this place
And though this blessing was a curse
Before I opened up my heart
You learn to take it as it comes
You fall together, fall apart

I want to show you
I want to be there

Angel Parra,"Volver a los diecisiete
Después de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete
Los convirtió el querubín",Volver A Los Diecisiete
Angel Rattay,"She knew she was different
When she was nine years old
She had a little trouble
Doing what she was told
Strong-willed, spirit-filled, innocent, wild
Not your typical yes ma'am, no ma'am child
It was her life and she was gonna live it
And if it took her heart and soul
She was gonna give it

She was young enough to question
Old enough to know
There's no place in this world she couldn't go
And if the road runs out
She's gonna build a bridge

That's just how she is, she is, she is, she is

The day she turned eighteen
She instinctively knew
Love is the teacher
Life is the school
And she figured it out one fateful day
That if she played it safe she would never play
And in that moment hearts dream about
A girl walked in and a woman walked out

She was young enough to question
Old enough to know
There's no place in this world she couldn't go
And if the road runs out
She's gonna build a bridge
To the other side
That's just how she is
That's just how she is, she is, she is, she is

Burning deep inside

I'd murder that son of a gun in the first degree

That ain't that I don't smoke myself 
And I don't reckon they'll injure your health
I've smoked 'em all my life and I ain't dead yet
But nicotine slaves are all the same 
At a pheasant party or a poker game
Everything's gotta stop when they have that cigarette

Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette

And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate 
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette

Ol' Dame Forson wasn't doin' me right
Them kings and queens just kept on comin' round
Well I got a full and I bet it high 
But my plug didn't work on a certain guy
He just kept a risin' and a layin' that money down
He's raise me and I'd raise him 
I sweated blood I had to sink or swim
He finally called and he didn't raise the bet

The cutest gal in the fifty states
A high bred uptown social little dame
She said she loved me and it seemed to me 
That things were like they ought a be
So hand in hand we strolled down Lover's Lane
She was oh so far from a chunk of ice 
And our smoochin' party was a goin' real nice
So help and I think I'd of been there yet
But I give her a hug and a little squeeze 
And she said ""Willie excuse me please

I don't give a damn what happens in there
Now I'm through, what a life
Because now I'm a freeman

As I look around I couldn't remember my old home
Now there's a tower block in its way
I remember all my friends and my wife
They don't want to know me anymore
They wouldn't listen, they didn't understand
They accused me of crime I didn't commit
It was some other guy, but it wasn't me
They wouldn't give in, they wouldn't believe me

Of a thousand years ago
The laughter of the gorgon
A female that brings doom

Don't look her in the eyes
Or you'll turn to stone
Don't let her deceive you
If you sense her don't look ‘round

Or you'll find that she will lead you
And you'll be buried in the ground
You may gaze at her reflection
In still waters of the lake

But don't look at her directly
Or death will be your fate
Beware of her at all times
Her serpents of hypnosis

More evil than the devil
Can kill you with her eyes
You have to get rid of her
The only way I know

Creep up behind with an axe
And decapitate with one blow
I can see you're all confused
And you feel you're being used

And now your heart is broken
So I watched as he set out
And without a doubt
He did as I advised him

That he killed the one that he loved",Gorgon

Angel y Khriz,"Siéntate hijo mío y escúchame 
Se que eres chico y quiero que empieces a entender 
No quiero que juegues jamás con mi guitarra 
Es juego de manos que después te llega al alma 
Yo la abrace mas tiempo a ella de lo que abrace a tu madre 
Es por eso que te pido no trates de acostumbrarte 

Te dolerá el corazón
Cuando quieras desahogarte con ella en una canción 
Por la que quiso engañarte

Sentirás que es tu mejor compañera 
En un momento de tristeza 
Con ella te desahogaras
Y nunca trates de olvidar algún amor con una copa 
Porque mas la recordaras 

Siéntate hijo mío y escúchame 
(Y nunca, nunca trates de ser como yo, te aconsejo por que te quiero 
es por eso es que te digo hijo escúchame) 

Siéntate hijo mío y escúchame 
Voy enseñarte a respetar a una mujer 
Si algún día te enamoras y ella tiene un feo pasado 
Solo tienes que preocuparte como se porte a tu lado 

Trata de nunca fijarte en mujeres que no están solas 
Yo sé que eso tiene un gustito tentador, pero hay otras

Algunas buscan amar 
Otras buscan aventuras 
Y muchas miraran solamente tu postura 
Serás seguramente un buen amante 
Ninguna podrá atraparte 
De esas que quieren lastimar

Serás un hombre echo y derecho 
pero para mí siempre serás

Para ustedes 

Yo, que todo te lo di 
Que por quererte a ti 
Perdí mi tiempo 
Y ahora estoy perdiendo 
Hasta las ganas de vivir 
No me pagues así 
No es justo que yo 
Que todo te lo di 
Que por quererte a ti 
Perdí mi tiempo 
Y ahora estoy perdiendo 
Hasta las ganas de vivir 
No me pagues así 
No es justo que yo 

Yo fui el hombre de tu vida 
Quien te enseño a amar 
El primero que, sin duda 
Te hizo temblar 
Para mí una fantasía hecha realidad 
Pero fui solo un juguete 
Para ti, uno más 
Acabaste en un minuto 
Lo que habíamos forjado 
El futuro que una vez tú y yo dibujamos 
Todo era maravilloso en nuestra relación 
Y como si no fuera nada, destrozaste mi corazón 

Yo, que todo te lo di 
Que por quererte a ti 
Perdí mi tiempo 
Y ahora estoy perdiendo 
Hasta las ganas de vivir 
No me pagues así 
No es justo que yo 
Que todo te lo di 
Que por quererte a ti 
Perdí mi tiempo 
Y ahora estoy perdiendo 
Hasta las ganas de vivir 
No me pagues así 
No es justo que yo 

Que por amarte tanto viva yo esta agonía 
Que por cuidarte tanto se muera mi alegría 
Por ti me ahogo en llanto, me duele tu rechazo 
Y sigo pensando que no es justo que yo, mujer 
Que por amarte tanto viva yo esta agonía 
Que por cuidarte tanto se muera mi alegría 
Por ti me ahogo en llanto, me duele tu rechazo 
Y sigo pensando que no es justo que yo, mujer 
Pase por esta tormenta de color 
De tus manos en mi piel todavía siento ardor 
Para mencionar tu nombre necesito valor 
Y aunque fuiste la desgracia, no te guardo rencor 
Minuto a minuto, he aprendido a superarlo 
La vida me va bien, ya paso el tiempo amargo 
Y aunque sea difícil aceptarlo 
Todavía no comprendo porque tu engaño, si 

Yo, que todo te lo di 
Que por quererte a ti 
Perdí mi tiempo 
Y ahora estoy perdiendo 
Hasta las ganas de vivir 
No me pagues así 
No es justo que yo 
Que todo te lo di 
Que por quererte a ti 
Perdí mi tiempo 
Y ahora estoy perdiendo 
Hasta las ganas de vivir 
No me pagues así 
No es justo que yo

En un transcurso de vida hasta el sol de hoy 
Me he caído y mi ego me levanto 
Me he jodído pa' ser quien soy y no me voy 
Entre medio de tripeos y de pichaera 
Yo luchaba por un sueño y ayudar mi vieja 
Echarle pa'l de chelitos en la cartera 
Y demostrarle a la gente quien Christian Colón era 
Un chamaquito que quería superar to' los atrasos 
Sufriendo de pobresa y a la vez de rechazo 
Y dicho sea de paso nunca me arrepiento del pasado 
Por el a fin de cuenta he madurado y he aprendido 
A ser agradecido con quien me ha ayudado 
A superarme y dar por hecho mi sueño dorado 
Muchas cicatrices llevo por lo que he resbalado 
Pero en exito y progreso me han recompensado 
Ahora río por lo que he llorado 
Y to'as las noches de rodilla Dios es alabado 
En la esquinita de la cama que tanto sufrí 
Porque me lo he ganado, ahora es que me toca a mi

Buscando plata pa' comer, y no pa' un bling bling 
Trabajando fuerte para poder subsistir 
Y mi desahogo era sentarme a escribir 
Y rimar de lo bueno que la vida era 
Del jangueo' y de to'a la jerga callejera 
Si hacia rimas de mi alacena 
Serian pocas porque no habia avena 
Y en el closet mucho menos ropa 
Inspirandome en la vida de otras personas 
Yo siendo material pa' la portada del ""Primera Hora"" 
Escribiendo lo que vi descubrí un talento 
Que aunque fuera en vano despejaba mi mente de este infierno
Pero en la calle ya la gente decía 
Que el que en la esquina vendía un gran futuro tendría 
Que si seguía como iba daban un vastagazo 
Y si volvia al callejon cogería un balaso 
Decidi cambiar y no dejar llevarme 
Buscar trabajo y en la universidad matricularme

Tenía una flor en el pelo
Todo un sueño
Y una mirada llena de bondad
Ella era as?
Bella como el sol y el mar
Así así
Imposible de olvidar
Ella era así
Bella como el sol y el mar

Algo me esta sucediendo
Te lo puedo describir
Al amor le estaba huyendo

Mami no te asombre
Desde que te vi
Mi corazón tiene tu nombre
Y de ti tengo hambre
Toda la noche me imagino contigo
Nada más yo de pasarla a tu cuerpo
Le di calambre
Es una sensación bien rara
De ti me gusta todo tu pelo y tu cara
Esa tu pista bronceada
Fueron muchos los factores que yo te amara
Algo me esta sucediendo

Quiero llevarte
Quisiera navegar la pasión
En un avión
Cual fuera la tentación
Por la vía del cariño en el tren del amor
Que el destino final sea mi corazón
Eres hecha
Para mi eres de mi
Y yo te quiero
Eres la mis bella en el mundo entero
Si que tu piensas en joyel
En tus ojos lo veo
Hay cupido me pego una aplicación bien feo

Angel y Khriz,"Hola que tal, como estas? Que te trae por aquí?
Tanto que el me hablo de ti, y es verdad
Todo lo que me dijo es asi
Pero se le olvido decir

Que eres la mas hermosa, de todas las mujeres
Que eres casi perfecta, pero que no lo quieres
Que no sientes lo mismo y aun que herirlo no debes
Solo que del cariño de una pasion que muere

Yo se que el es mi amigo
Por eso nunca te hable
Pero hoy tengo que decirte que

Me enamoré, sin querer, sin razón, sin motivos
No se como fue, pero me enamoré
Tal vez fue todo lo que me dijo 
Tal vez no este bien

Pero me enamoré sin querer, sin razón, sin motivos
No se como fue, pero me enamoré
Tal vez fue todo lo que me dijo 
Tal vez no este bien
Pero me enamoré

Dime quien manda en el corazón 
Herirlo no es mi intencion
Pero quien va a entender que su alegría es mi perdición 
Sentire la presion y el efecto 
De fallarle a un amigo por mis defectos
Y a la vez conocer el amor perfecto para mi esto no hay pretextos

Se atento no valgo nada, no se como no darle cara
Perdóneme amigo que respetaba
Hoy tu cara soy bestia

Me enamoré, sin querer, sin razón, sin motivos
No se como fue, pero me enamoré
Tal vez fue todo lo que me dijo 
Tal vez no este bien

Pero me enamoré sin querer, sin razón, sin motivos
No se como fue, pero me enamoré
Tal vez fue todo lo que me dijo 
Tal vez no este bien
Pero me enamoré

Pa ser como por arte de magia
Me enamoré de todo lo que el decia
De tu cara, tus ojos, tu boca, tu piel
Y cada amanecer muy bella te veía
Y dime que puedo hacer
Si eres la mujer que me eriza la piel

Se que es un error quererla a usted
Pero en mi lado la quiero tener y
Fue creciendo poco a poco 
Este amor tan fuerte que siento por ti
Las noches son tan amargas por que no te tengo aqui
Fue creciendo el sentimiento 
Y sin darme cuenta diciéndote a ti
Sin ti no puedo vivir

Me enamoré, sin querer, sin razón, sin motivos
No se como fue, pero me enamoré
Tal vez fue todo lo que me dijo
Tal vez no este bien

Pero me enamoré sin querer, sin razón, sin motivos
No se como fue, pero me enamoré
Tal vez fue todo lo que me dijo
Tal vez no este bien
Pero me enamoré

Mi amor que te puedo decir
Me enamoré de ti
En el libro de los sentimientos nada esta escrito
Y en el lenguaje del amor 
No existe el jamas y el por siempre
Que el corazón decida

Voy buscando un corazón 
Que en el verano se perdió
Y no hay más indicios, que alguien dijo 
Que en otra cama durmió

Sigo el rastro desolado
De un amor desesperado 
Que no dijo adiós, es más dijo
Vendría con el alba y no volvió
Desapareció, ni huella dejó

Y lo busqué, hasta debajo de la cama 
Y encontré, pedazos de mi alma desangrándose
No le importó buscar doctor o alguna curación
Pa' que no muriera de amor
De pena murió

I'm happy when I'm sad 
Through all the times we shared 
I never felt alone 
Now, I still can smell your skin 
I still can taste your kiss 
And that I'll always miss 
And everything we've ever been 

Now I'm broken...without you 
I'm broken,...broken without you 
I'm broken,...broken without you 

I cannot fall asleep 
Lying in my bed 
Spinning in my head 
Thinking how it used to be 

Now I'm broken...without you 
I'm broken,...broken without you 
I'm broken,...broken without you 

I'm sick of crying it's all I do 
Been counting days to just get through 
I'm trying to be strong but it's just no use 

I'm broken over you 
I'm broken,...broken without you

Angela Ammons,"Every time I need you
You're never there
So I go, so tell me what did I do
To keep you from holding on

I've cried the tears but that's not enough
To show you everything I'm missing
And you ask why did you leave me
Oh, why don't you believe me when I say

You never tried to stop the walls from tumbling down
You never tried to pick me up when no one was around
If I could break through, if I could be strong
If I could let go, I could stop the echo of you

So, I'm running as fast as I can, here I go
You're everything I don't want
But you have what I need, you come back
You're everywhere I go

I feel you all around me and you ask, what did I do
What to keep me from you and I say

You never tried to stop the walls from tumbling down
You never tried to pick me up when no one was around
If I could break through, if I could be strong
If I could let go, I could stop the echo

So many times I walked away, without leaving
Oh, but this time I'm going away believing, oh, oh

We should rewind and listen
To everything you've told me
So say goodbye to all your promises
While I promise you goodbye

You never tried to stop the walls from tumbling down
You never tried to pick me up when no one was around
If I could break through, if I could be strong
If I could be right but I could be wrong

If I could break through, if I could be strong
If I could let go, I could stop the echo of you
",Echo
Angela Ammons,"I believed in once upon a times
Happy ever after fairy tales
I believed a love I thought was mine
Never thought this heart could be so frail

All the shades you are have been shown
When somebody sees them, you will be alone

Will anybody know who I am
When I fall in love?
Will he be my best friend
Does anybody really know who you are

Or do they sometimes pretend they do?
Does love pretend too?

Silver futures that I'm searching for
Is love lucky or is it blind?
Round and round the seasons pass you by
The same thing happens time and time again, I'm asking why

Will anybody know who I am
When I fall in love?
Will he be my best friend?
Does anybody really know who you are

Or do they sometimes pretend they do?
Does love pretend too?

The tears have helped release the fears inside
They tell me I will find a love
And now I'm in a place where all the shades you are have been shown
And still here I am all alone

Does anybody really know who you are
Or do they sometimes pretend they do?
Does love pretend too?
",Pretend

And asked me for a smile
I pretended to for a while
I said I'd do anything
To always be with you

But it could never be too soon
And I, I always feel you near me
Tell me you can hear me
'Cause baby I still hear you...ohhh

And I know that nothing lasts forever
And baby, I will never, ever leave this feeling
Of loving you

When I hear your voice
I swear, I hear you breathe
Your body next to mine holding me

And just when I believed
It never has to end
Good bye will never come again
Ohhhh, but it always comes again

[Chorus: ]

And I know that nothing lasts forever
And baby I will never, ever leave this feeling
Of loving you

Baby I have faith that someday destiny will take its place
If I could just hold on, to someday soon

But it could never be too soon

Just seeing where we've been
Can't find no direction though we try hard to pretend
That we're not walking backwards but we are again and again

Is it too late to change?

Teenage grownups passing on their painted legacies

False religions being crowned
Politicians tied and bound
We have to make a stand today, the time has come for us to change

Of western Kentucky

In pastures of green 
The sun on your withers 
The wind in your mane

And it's run for the roses 
As fast as you can

Your moment's at hand 
It's the chance of a lifetime 
In a lifetime of chance 
And it's high time you joined
In the dance 
It's high time you joined

From sire to sire 
It's born in the blood
The fire of a mare 
And the strength of a stud 
It's breeding and it's training
And it's something unknown
That drives you 
And carries you home 
 
And it's run for the roses

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland

In a phrase how I feel

Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.

No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,

I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Angela Kaset,"First time he laid eyes on her he kissed his heart goodbye
He nearly drove right off the road, all she did was smile
But when she burned up their first dinner and lay cryin' on the couch
That's the moment that he fell in love from the inside out

She loved the way he always brought flowers to the door
He took her to new places that she'd never been before
When he lost his job and he lost his pride and his heart was filled with doubt
That's when she knew how much she loved that man from the inside out

From the inside love is stronger
Than the outside lookin' in
When the tears flow you learn what love's about
From the inside out

She has watched her raven hair slowly turn to gray
Since the day that he retired he just gets in the way
Well they ain't much to look at, two old faces in the crowd
But they could write the book of love from the inside out

From the inside love is stronger
Than the outside lookin' in
And as the years go you learn what love's about
From the inside out

Angela Kaset,"When you think you've reached the end of the line
Walls that once blocked your way
Come tumbling down
And you'll find the answers were there all the time

When we turn out the lights and we sit in the dark
Is the mountain too high to climb?
Halfway to heaven
When you're flat on your back you can still see the stars
Guiding you through the night
Halfway to paradise

Tin Gods plan
Life's doors Siam
To hold you back
When you're born on the wrong side of the track
Don't take no
Take hold
Don't leave it to chance

When we turn out the lights and we sit in the dark
Is the mountain too high to climb?
Halfway to heaven
When you're flat on your back you can still see the stars
Guiding you through the night
Halfway to paradise

You let the world roll by
You're trying to hang yourself without a rope
Mister dream - take control
I am the means to reach your goal

When we turn out the lights and we sit in the dark
Is the mountain too high to climb?
Halfway to heaven
When you're flat on your back you can still see the stars
Guiding you through the night

And the lightning comes streaming in our home
But oh a summer of our own
It's been done
It's been done
And I'm so proud of loving, again

It's been done

Wishing I was yours forever
Can we rely on love?
I was lost, cut underneath by another
And the feeling that crept into our home
But oh a winter of our own
It's been done
It's been done
And oh I'm so proud of living, again

Crossing your heart and hope to die
The skin I'm touching will never lie

Can't keep listening to what you say
What you say, what you say

I know it makes my insides crawl
Think, you think, you know it all
Know it all, know it all

Oh God, you're reading Albert Camus
And there's not much things you can't do
Can't you see they're laughin' at you

Oh dear, I'm getting weary
Of the same show every night
It wouldn't be so hard if you weren't so right

I've gotta talk to you today
Can't keep listening to what you say
What you say, what you say

I know you can't get over yourself
It's so hard to listen to someone else

Oh dear, I'm getting weary
Of the same show every night
It wouldn't be so hard if you weren't so right

Feel like you're well-meaning
It's not your fault, I know
You're on medication
It's helping you to grow
Oh no

Of the same show every night

Long live I

Would you hover and caress me?
Would you hang me from the Christmas tree?

Angela McCluskey,"Love, love, love
Love, love, love

Me and my friend we're walking in the cold light of mourning
Tears may blind the eyes but the soul is not deceived
In this world even winter ain't what it seems

Here come the blue skies, here comes springtime
When the rivers run high and the tears run dry
When everything that dies shall rise

Love, love, love
Is stronger than death
Love, love, love
Is stronger than death

In our lives we hunger for things we cannot touch
All the thoughts unuttered all the feelings unexpressed
Play upon our hearts like the mist upon our breath
But awoken by grief, our spirits speak

How could you believe that the life within the seed
That grew arms that reached and a heart that beat
And lips that smiled and eyes that cried could ever die?

Here come the blue skies, here comes springtime
When the rivers run high and the tears run dry
When everything that dies shall rise

Love, love, love
Is stronger than death
Love, love, love
Is stronger than death
Love, love, love
Is so much stronger than death

The spade and the shovel

Or we could make a garden here

Don't the birds move slow
Their wings get frozen here

Mas vou duvidar

Já quer se entregar

Aviso, cobrança
Você vai por mim

Lá vou na esperança

Quem sabe até meu destino
Amor sem espinhos
Sou mel da sua boca, calor dos abraços
E tantos beijinhos

Se o sonho acabou
Não sei meu amor
Nem quero saber
Só sei que ontem à noite
Sorrindo acordada
Sonhei com você

Às vezes até na vida é melhor
Ficar bem sozinho

De um simples carinho

Te sinto no ar
Na brisa do mar

For us to share this love

But love is not a selfish need
Why if I take it must I bleed?
Or is that how it's meant to be
If only we could live inside my dreams

Then I could love you every night
Hold you until the morning light
No one to say what's wrong or right
The way it has to be

Wish I could love you every night
Hold you until the morning light
No one to say what's wrong or right
Oh, how I wish, I wish we could be free

Every night I wanna be with you
Doing all the things we wanna do
(Oh, baby)
A place for only you and me
To unleash these fantasies

Oh, how I wish I could be free with you
To do all the things I've dreamed to do, baby
I would give you all the love you could need
Oh, how I wish we could be free

Then I could love you every night
Hold you until the morning light
(My love)
No one to say what's wrong or right
(What's wrong or right)
The way it has to be
(The way it has to be)

Wish I could love you every night

Don't underestimate the things that I will do.

Throw your soul through every open door,
Count your blessings to find what you look for.
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold,
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown.

Why voy de aqui a alla.

Recorro la ciudad
Camino sin parar
Why ya no se que hacer
Ni a donde mirar

Que es lo que me pasa
Esto no es normal

Tu sentada en un sillon
Yo en la esquina del bar
Nos miramos sin parar
No puedo disimular

Algo me hare pensar
Que tu eres para mi
No puedo resistir
Ni un momento mas

Quiero why no puedo
Seguir tu juego

You can't help the things she's learned in school
Like how she walks and who she knows 'cause it's too late

Just last night you saw her as an angel
Just last night she saw you as a man
You can love her
You can love her

Solo como antes mi amor.

Me gusta estar contigo asi serca de

Al besar tu boca why al mirar tus lindos
Ojos me parece estar soñando al besar
Tus labios rojos. Cuando estoy contigo
Me gusta estarte mirando porque 
Tienes una cara tan linda, divina why con
Esa sonrisa eres un amor.

Que ella dejo de quererte

De haber perdido el tiempo

Que se tuvo que ir y muy lejos

Y ahora si la vez
Ni le preguntes
Que si te quiere
Ya no te quiere

Te quiso mucho
Cuanto te quiso
Y hoy al que ama
Contigo tiene un parecido

Pero distintos en sentimientos
Porque él es bueno
Y tú sigues siendo el mismo

Te quiso como a nadie
Y jamás lo ha negado

Pero ahora es muy distinto
Otra vez se ha enamorado
El ya sabe que te quiso
Y también que te ha olvidado

Que sufrió para olvidar tus besos
Que se tuvo que ir y muy lejos

Le enseño también a perdonarte
Y a quererlo, como lo quiere

Te quiso mucho cuanto te quiso
Que hoy al que ama
Contigo tiene un parecido

As I lay beside you 
With a quivered look on my face 
Was this real or was I fooling myself? 
Did I make a mistake? 

As you gently sleep 
All I can do is stare 
When the sun breaks through, what will you do? 

Over and over you tell me how much you care for me 
And over and over you hold me like lovers do 
Now over and over I wonder when the morning comes 
Will you still be here? 

When you wake, will you still feel the same? 
Please don't make me feel like this was all in vain 
'Cause I've given you my precious love 
I gave you all I had 

Over and over you tell me how much you care for me 
And over and over you hold me like lovers do 
Now over and over I wonder when the morning comes 
Will you still be here? 

Will you still be here?",Over and Over

Tears are falling from my eyes, 
And I can't find the reasons why. 
Tears are falling from my eyes, 
My eyes, tears are falling. 

Tears are falling from my eyes, 
And I can't find the reasons why. 
Tears are falling from my eyes, my eyes, my eyes. 

I ask myself how could this be that you walked out on me? 
Now here I am, 
Alone again, 'cause you abandoned me. 
I'll never show it. 
I smile all day to try to hide the pain. 
Seems like I'm happy and that I wouldn't have it any other way. 

Chorus 

And what about the love we shared 
And all the memories? 
With innocence, 
I thought you'd love me for eternity. 
I should've seen it, 
I can't believe you played me with your selfish game. 

My heart is healin' so now 
You better know I won't be fooled again. 

Chorus 

En segiendote, este dolor nunca imagine. 
Why lastimandome, recuerdos que nunca olvidare. 
Sueno en tus brazos why en despertar, 
Empiezo a llorar. 
Pero voy descubriendo que tengo fuerzo en mi why soy mejor sin ti.

May I have your attention, please? 
Are your nostrils aquiver and tingling as well 
At that delicate, luscious ambrosial smell? 
Yes they are, I can tell

Well, ladies and gentlemen

Is like nothing compared to its succulent source
As the gourmets among you will tell you, of course

You can't imagine the rapture in store
Just inside of this door! 

There you'll sample

Throw the old woman out!

What's my secret? 
Frankly, dear — forgive my candor 
Family secret
All to do with herbs
Things like being 
Careful with your coriander
That's what makes the gravy grander

Eat them slow and 
Feel the crust, how thin I (she) rolled it! 
Eat them slow, 'cos 
Every one's a prize! 
Eat them slow, 'cos 
That's the lot and now we've sold it! 
Come again tomorrow

Hold it
Bless my eyes 
Fresh supplies! 

How about it, dearie? 
Be here in a twinkling! 
Just confirms my theory

God watches over us
Didn't have an inkling

The morning rain clouds up my window, and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be grey, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay, my head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today, I'm late for work again
And even if I'm there, they'll all imply that I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad, it's not so bad and

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life
Push the door, I'm home at last and I'm soaking through and through
Then you handed me a towel and all I see is you
And even if my house falls down now, I wouldn't have a clue
Because you're near me and

Angelina,"On the day I was born, 
said my father, said he,
I've an elegant legacy 
waiting for ye.
Tis a rhyme for your lips 
and a song for your heart,
To sing whenever the world falls apart.

Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow it over the hill and stream.
Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.

'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child.
Oh, the lure of that song 
Kept her feet running wild.
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill.

So, I bundled me heart and I roamed the world free.
To the east with the lark
Tow the west with the sea.
And I searched all the world and I scanned all the skies.
But I found it at last in my own true love's eyes.",Look to the Rainbow

There's only one song worth singin',
They may try and sell ya,
'Cause it hangs them up to see someone like you.
But you've gotta make your own music
Sing your own special song,
Make your own kind of music even if nobody else sings along.
You're gonna be knowing
The loneliest kind of lonely,
It may be rough goin',
Just to do your thing's the hardest thing to do.
But you've gotta make your own music
Sing your own special song,
Make your own kind of music even if nobody else sings along.
So if you cannot take my hand,
And if you must be goin',

This is not a film
This is my song
Now pick up your shovel and
Dig
I don't want to bring your Gods down babe
I don't want to bring your Gods down babe
Their flesh and blood for you too real
The wine that flows from their nostrils
Too red
Their master strokes too fundamental
Their saint soaked cathedrals too done
I don't want to bring your Gods down babe
I don't want to bring your Gods down babe
The ferocity of their cat claws too steel
And we the weak kneed weeds of their
Weaker breed never paused to feel
We're not the masters of the land we survey
But I guess you'd come to that conclusion
When you're ready in your own time anyway
I don't want to bring your Gods down babe
I don't want to bring your Gods down babe
Because their armour and their crest cuts too deep
And the cold landcliffs where they rest are far too steep
But I just wanna say to you that like your
Gods, your guilt and your beliefs I too wanna be
With you 'til the very end babe

So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
The storm keeps on twisting
Keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference

It's easier to believe in this sweet madness oh
This glorious sadness that brings me to my knees

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

My hands are tied to worlds alone,
And this I know.
Your breath's like wine,
And just like clouds, my skin crawls.
It's so divine, the sky it glows with fields of light.

Did you know that I love you?
Come and lay with me.
I love you.
And honestly, I will love you.
You make me feel alive,
And I'll love you
Until the end of time.

My hands shake clasped with fear as you come near
To say goodnight, just like a dove.
A peaceful sign.
To help us by as you come in.
Let this begin.
Stars fall like dust, our lips will touch.
We speak too much.

It's always hard, when you're around me
But here right now, there's interest in your eyes

I recommend such a setting site
And the thousands of stars come out thousands of times
And we can go, only if you believe.

Only if you believe.

Do you feel like you've lost everything you can lose?
This is it, can you hear me?
When you cry do your fears ever Chill up the room?
Calling out in a moment of need.
Do you ever lay awake with a look in the eye?
Asking god if a wish is too big to deny?
I will offer a line. And it is ready for use.
Let me know are you ready for me?

I'd like to say, that you're my only fear.
And when I dream, it slowly disappears.
And when I wake. I'm right here by your side
To feel your heart, beat in and out of time.

When the storm brings rain, snow, fate of all kinds,
You can feel almost anything.
When the day seems to melt, fall flat into night,
You can feel almost anything.
When you can't go on, you got to get up and try.
This is it, can you feel me?
And when the bombs come down. We will make it alive.
But only if you want to believe.

In a small brown house in suburban streets
With a skateboard and my shit guitar,
I dreamed all day that they would get me far.
My dad would ask me about my grades,
The asshole sports that I never played.
And then I'd ask about the girls he'd date,
Behind our back when mom had stayed up late.
It was near when I turned sixteen,
Got kicked out of school and so it seemed,
Things were closing in and ready to blow.
My dad moved out about that year or so.
It took an hour to start a punk rock band,
To upset my fucked up family land.
And as I held my mum would start to cry,
I swore ourselves, a better life

If I had a chance for another try,
I wouldn't change a thing
This made me all on who I am inside
And if I could thank God
That I am here, and that I am alive
And everyday I wake
I tell myself a little harmless lie
The whole wide world is mine

The summers gone, the years have passed,
My friends have changed, a few did last,
The smallest dreams got pushed aside,
The largest ones that changed my life,
And all I wish for was come to past
From rock and roll, to love and cash
It's all success if it's what you need
Do what you like and do it honestly

If I had a chance for another try,

Cause we're all asleep at the wheel
Asleep and so surrounded by
What we feel

A bad dream

On a rope and pulled through an ocean
With my heart, I'm lost out at sea
And every kind of thought screams misery

So lonely

Im a johnny come lately
But I will not give up
And the words they escape me
But I'm full of dumb luck
And the world is an oyster
With a poisonous shell
And the look in my eye
Is a look that can kill

And Dream a bit

I am not, without emotion
I have ran, from the pain of my will
From the mess of a hunt and a catch, and the thrill

And I'm ill

I am known, in the circles of envy
I'd thank God, but then what is he for
Cause I left a few hard calls at his front door

I'll leave more

Come a little bit closer now

To a little light fire now

The current, the pilot, antennas and sirens
Like college, like thieves that, can eat with the wolfpack

Cause I have all the time
To take it slow and easy
Sure let the devil in my mind
Decide too fast
Once upon a time
You got to make sure gotta tolerate
The devil in my mind
To think you'll live from your past

They said it's a mistake
That I'm afraid to keep it
They don't want heartaches
To be an adolescence
But then my mind said
Right from wrong
But I'll just have to wait
For love to come along

Cause I have all the time
To take it slow and easy
Don't let the devil in my mind
Decide too fast
Once upon a time
Got to make sure gotta tolerate
The devil in my mind
To think you'll live from your past

Though it is hard
I try to hold back
But I'm falling for you
The feeling that I can't undo
I breathe and shake it
Live each moment
Once upon a time

Vous font croire à l'enfer jusqu'à perdre la flamme
L'amour peut aller jusqu'à défaire
Ce qu'il avait bâtit de ses larmes
Et l'incendie qui détruit les archives
Fait s'effacer le passé en nous tout à fait
On ne voit plus une seule âme qui vive, un cœur à réchauffer

Et sans plus attendre du chaud, du tendre
Fais moi danser sur les cendres
Dis moi de me rendre sans me défendre
En plein décembre, nos cœurs se fendent
À se répendre, sur les cendres

J'ai vu les feux éphémères des passions
Qu'on sacrifie sur le bûcher des vanités
J'ai vu se calciner les émotions
Et ne même plus chanter

Et sans plus attendre du chaud, du tendre
Fais moi danser sur les cendres
Dis moi de me rendre sans me défendre
En plein décembre
Nos cœurs se fendre à se répendre

Près de toi viendra l'envers de l'oubli

And I'm spinning around like a satellite
With daze in my head I can't abide

To show how much you mean to me
I'd give up my gravity
I'd walk the surface of the sea

Breathe in water

Somehow I feel so lost with a homeless heart
I've nowhere to run I've nowhere to hide
When I am missing you

But I chase the dark clouds from my eyes
Send them away like butterflies
When I think about you

To show how much you mean to me

Somehow the heat of the sun's not as strong
As the warmth I knew and could only belong
To the sky of my home
No other than from my home

Thought I've been gone
Painting lines of destiny on my own
Tasting water from the sea of unknown
But whenever the wind blows
The winter's here in my soul

Some things can't be erased
From a paper
Blood cannot be replaced
By water
Dreams that I have embraced
Can't cover the trace of my home
Of my home

I don't know when
I can go back and start over again
Will I be a stranger will they be friends
Doubts are pouring like the rain
Hoping they can understand

Some things can't be erased
From a paper
Blood cannot be replaced
By water
Dreams that I have embraced
Can't cover the trace of my home

Can you see on my face ?
Come closer
This love cannot be disgraced
By anger

Can't cover the trace of my home

Cause when you young, you don't see how life can pass you by 
You don't even really care if you gon' starve or not 
This go back to ninety-three when I got the job at Hot 
I used to answer the phones for Flex, do overnight spurts 
Back then, I was like, ""Hey who knows? It might work"" 
I wasn't satisfied, but it would just begin 
Cause in ninety-five, I was every day, six to ten 
I put in a lot of work so I could bring in my listeners 
I secured a fanbase, although some of them dissed us 
I was new at my thang, but I was doin my thang 
And I would never let nobody try to ruin my thang 
But of course, there were people couldn't stand where I was 
Cause although know I'm in, I wasn't made what I was 
Through the heat, kept it movin, throw the haters a smile 
What would they do if they knew her heart was fragile? 
[Chorus]

Angela.. (uh-huh) Angela.. (hahahah) 
Angela.. (wooh!) Angela.. (uhh, uhh) 
[Angie Martinez] 
Overall, it's a rough business, it could stop even you 
There's people that's gonna say things that's not even true 
Like the one about me not bein down for my women 
And I hated the lesbian rumors that went around for a minute 
How bout the one that goes, 'Yeah, she goes with him. 
He bought her the car, the ice, the clothes and rims.' 
And I'm sure you all heard she caught one dead in the face 
It'd been different if she said what she said to my face 
As for men, who knows where my story will start 
I went through a relationship that nearly tore me apart 
So I'm chillin for now, it's all about me for the moment 
cause there's things that I wouldn't allow 
But I'ma be aight though, keep comin with tight flow 
Try to stay on the low while I'm watchin your hype grow 
Playin the role like nobody can cramp your style 
But I know, like you know, that you're fragile

Reverse in the hearse, another body bring me the nurse 
Make you react first

Ask me, we floss fancy, me and Angie

Funk Flex blastin' with it, I'm masterin' it 
Linda Carter of the rap game 
With gold bangles on my wrists, latin' chicks on the map mayn 
Man the game plan's arran-gin 
A house on the hills of the main-land, get on board 
Step inside, arrest my eyes, I don't sleep 
Confess sometimes I roll deep 
Underestimating mine is to not know me 
I, analyze, every situation 
And I rise to any occasion 
And I, stays in, do me mode then I'm 
Runnin' the streets, in do me clothes with a 
Sweatsuit and a fresh pair of sneakers
