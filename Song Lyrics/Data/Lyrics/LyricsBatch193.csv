Jesus Jones,"Who am I? Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?

Have you ever felt that it's someone else living your life?
The image of you only better, it's true at the outside

Who am I? Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?
Who am I? Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?

Is there nothing I've done that was truly begun by the real me?
Have I stood to the side aware of the tide that drags me out to the sea

Who am I? Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?
Who am I? Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?

Who am I? Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?
Who am I? Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?
Who am I? Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?
Who am I? Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?
",Who? Where? Why?
Jesus Jones,"I think I know what you mean
And although it sounds obscene
I will always do my best to understand
You have so many words
And your voice is always heard
But who can say they really understand?
Real, real, real
Do you feel real?
And if so I'd like to know
How to feel real real
Do you feel real?
And if so I'd like to know
Well you say you have a big love
And it really sounds like fun
If I knew what it was
Then I'm sure I'd like to have one
Give me a sign that you
Feel some emotion
Real, real, real
Do you feel real?
And if so I'd like to know
How to feel real real
Do you feel real?
And if so I'd like to know
Say what you like you know that no-one
Really minds
And if there's nothing to say, then
Why don't we all go away?
Do you real-
Do you real-
Do you really feel real? (??)
Real, real, real
Do you feel real?
And if so I'd like to know
How to feel real real
Do you feel real?
And if so I'd like to know
But if there's nothing to say, then
Why don't we all go away?
Real, real, real
Do you feel real?
And if so I'd like to know
How to feel real real
Do you feel real?
And if so I'd like to know
Do you real-
Do you real-
Do you really feel real?

Jesus Jones,"A life to call our own
That is ours alone
Is as hard as hell to come by these days
Time that I took what's mine, took it now

Things aren't what they where, they're what they are
There's no time of our own

And the devil you know is the only one
And the devil you know is the only one

Is time too fast for us to grasp something of our own?
The ghost of the past has its arms around me
It moves everywhere in all I hear and see

And the devil you know is the only one
And the devil you know is the only one

Look at you now, look at you then, see how you will be
All of your life belongs to me

Things aren't what they where, they're what they are
There's no time of our own

And the devil you know is the only one
",The Devil You Know
Jesus Jones,"You came at the right time, filled the right space
And ever since then I've never seen your true face
You and me, what do we know of each other?

You're a cartoon, the butt of bad jokes
Every picture of you seems out of focus
You're evil personified come to avenge
Our perfect enemy out for revenge
You and me, what do we know of each other?

I, I, I don't believe it
I don't believe it
I, I, I don't believe it
There's nothing here that seems to fit

There no doubt what you did was wrong
You'll get no excuse in this song
But an eye for an eye makes no sense to me
The state of us now is this how it'll always be?
You and me, what do we know of each other?

I, I, I don't believe it
I don't believe it
I, I, I don't believe it
There's nothing here that seems to fit

Who does it serve
To believe every word you heard
To hear without listening
Look without seeing

You came at the right time, filled the right space
And ever since then I've never seen your true face
You and me, what do we know of each other?

I, I, I don't believe it
I don't believe it
I, I, I don't believe it
There's nothing here that seems to fit",Don't Believe It
Jesus Jones,"If I hold you to the light
Should I see right through you?
If I question what you are will it bring me any closer to you?
From Love to War
What we aim for is to keep the illusion
You can take your conscience for a lover
And satisfied there is no other
You can dream
Any doubts we had
Had better not show
What good would they do us
Leaving us nowhere to go?
From Love to War
What we aim for is to keep the illusion
Taking a stand for the benefit of man
And angry with pride because God is on our side
I could do with some sleep
'Cause the rubbish I talk is getting deep
And if I don't believe in you
Then there's nothing I can do
But throw myself at the walls 
And love no-one at all
From Love to War
What we aim for is to keep the illusion
You can take your conscience for a lover
And satisfied there is no other
You can dream",From Love to War
Jesus Jones,"Oh we had some magic and used it all
There's a tinge of regret but not what you'd call real sorrow
Didn't think much, if at all
Whatever the cost We'll pay it all tomorrow
But I'd rather be damned than let you go
And I'd rather be damned ''cause I know
You've gotta get a good thing when you see it
We let our lives slip, just for a while
It took all we had but it made you smile too
And I'd rather be damned than let you go
And I'd rather be damned 'cause I know
You've gotta get a good thing when you see it 
But I'd rather be damned than let you go
And I'd rather be damned 'cause I know
You've gotta get a good thing when you see it",Get a Good Thing
Jesus Jones,"I played with the fire
Stared at the light, screamed at the pain
Pushed to the centre
Took no advice, waited in vain
I questioned it too
Thought about me, thought about you
The corruption between us
The power and lies, dreams come true
I don't know if I care
I can't feel, I can't speak, I can't think
Caught in an idiot stare
I won't let it go
Hold it to me, it's mine to the end
A shadow that hugs me
My black dog, my enemy friend
I don't know if I care
I can't feel, I can't speak, I can't think
Caught in an idiot stare",Idiot Stare
Jesus Jones,"All the things I read come from magazines
My concentration never was what it might have been
And I know that I'm impatient but there isn't really time
To have all these ideas going through my mind
Magazine
For your survival
Magazine
There's no modern rival
Magazine
Choose what I want to read so I'm never bored
All the time I save I use to read more
Magazine
It's just like the real thing
Magazine
But better looking
Magazine
From the absurd to the obscene
Uncovered here in
Magazine
All of life in fun size
Magazine
And you can win this great prize
Magazine.",Magazine
Jesus Jones,"Compromise and confusion tears away... 
Well they say ignorance is bliss
Unless something is amiss
How 'bout that?
And the problem with success
Is you become what you detest
How 'bout that?
How 'bout that?
So who do you believe
And who do you trust
Well it may as well be you
Cause it seems 
That no one else has got a clue
Get it wrong get it right
You can try as hard as you like
But there's no such thing 
In the world as the right decision
It's okay to get a smile
Just as long as it's not dumb 
How 'bout that?
And two wrongs don't make a right
But thereUs a conflict they just might
How 'bout that?
How 'bout that?
Suspend your trust
Reserve our belief
And did all I could do
In the hope that I might pick up any clue
Get it wrong get it right
You can try it as hard as you might
But there's no such thing
In the world as the right decision
It's our soul that we protect
Because we may just break our neck
How 'bout that?
And for every question why
There's a answer on the sly
If you will look in the eye... 
Get it wrong get it right
You can try as hard as you like
But there's no such thing
In the world as the right decision
Get it wrong get it right
You can try as hard as you like
But there's no such thing
In the world as the right decision",The Right Decision
Jesus Jones,"In my life there's a right time and a right place
There is order
There is method well, you know where
There is routine, nothing spare
Catch the light in a different way
And all the bullshit falls away and I
Stare, into a heart of darkness
There is no good, no evil, only me
There is no love, not anymore
I don't think there ever was
As for me, I feel no hate
I may believe in luck
But not in fate
Stare, into a heart of darkness
There is no good, no evil, only me
Stare, into a heart of darkness
There is no good, no evil, only me
On the wall there is a red light
When I close my eyes
I see spirals.",Spiral
Jesus Jones,"I'm trapped in words
Held hostage by my friends
Tripped up by meaning
Taking a road just to get to it`s end
Tongue Tied
It's killing me
I want to see things for the first time
Show you things that are brighter, darker, sharper, softer
But I'm struck dumb and dead
Thoughts like paper over fire
There's a hole in my world
That makes me talk like a liar
Over there I see a fist fight
A woman in a care full of toys smokes a cigarette
Conversations twist and turn
I get the feeling I am learning more than ever before
This is the first time
Tongue Tied
It's killing me",Tongue Tied
Jesus Jones,"There is a line between good and evil
That separates light from dark
But a colour now spells our end
And everywhere I see its mark, it's
Yellow Brown
In the city air, in all our seas
You can see every other colour bleed into
Yellow Brown
There is no time to spend
Concerned that this is just a trend
To lay the blame everywhere
When it's yours that is the lion's share of
Yellow Brown
And I won't do
'Cause you won't do
'Cause we know there's nothing they will do about
Yellow Brown
There's nothing to save us from ourselves
But the world keeps turning
The world keeps turning",Yellow Brown
Jesus Jones,"Include me out
You dig your own grave
You build your own walls
I don't believe enough to believe in you
Oh no, not me, I'm not part of your crusade
Don't need your approval
Your safety in numbers
You stay in your team
I don't care enough to share your dream
Oh no, not me, I'm not part of your crusade
I don't need someone like you
Expecting me to share your views
'Cause I don't expect that what you see has anything to do with me
Oh no, not me, I'm not part of your crusade",Your Crusade
Jesus Jones,"Across the world the message flies
Information, truth and lies
It's all yours and it's all mine
You just have to find the time
We're all the same, we share the blame, we play the games
If it's yes or no the decision is easy, it's easy
Zeroes and ones will take us there.
Zeroes and ones will take us there.

This time the revolution will be computerised
You'll know it as you do it
In real time before your eyes
Slip between realities
There's more to this than anything that you or I can see
The world is mine the world is yours and here's the cause
Zeroes and ones will take us there.
Zeroes and ones will take us there.

I've stared into the heart of it all
Seen the pictures on the wall
The beat of a heart
The oceans part and the patterns in my mind

This time, we've split the world once more
There's those that have and that don't in information wars
Wer'e not alone 'cos all is known and it's everywhere, it's everywhere

Zeroes and ones will take us there.
Zeroes and ones will take us there.

Jesus Jones,"It's addiction, it's obsession, it's a need to be me
It's addiction, it's obsession, so I can feel that I'm free

Born in a time that sanctions all desire
I fight my instincts all the way
Drawn to a storm of things I have to have
With patience like other virtues still in the way

I get enough of things to need them more
Like love and destruction to name but two
It's getting harder telling good from bad
With you senses asking was it good for you

It's addiction, it's obsession, it's a need to be me

There's so much I feel I have to have","Addiction, Obsession & Me"
Jesus Jones,"Free for a moment, high above.
Just for a moment I am in the arms of love.

If I could be all that I want to be,
The greats of ths world would hang their heads in despair.
If you could hear what I want you to hear
You'd think you couldn't breathe without that sound.

And there's always something more that I should tell you;
More lost that I am found.
So I'm trying to clear my head so I'll be...

If I could say all that I want to say,
I'd hide in shame for years when I was done.

But there's always something more that I should tell you;
More lost than I am found.
So I'm trying to clear my head so I'll be...

And there's the rub in being human;
It'll get in the way of all your dreaming.",For a Moment
Jesus Jones,"It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
Stand back; look out tomorrow,
Here comes a man without sorrow.

I guess it's okay if today's unlike the rest,
And it's okay that I'm not quite at my best.
But if you're looking at me to set your mind at ease,
Well, then there's no way, let's just give it all a rest.

I know you and all you're thinking;
You know me; you know I'm sinking.

Stand back; look out tomorrow,
Here comes a man without sorrow.
Good thing looks are deceiving.
Quick smile, then I should be leaving.

And, so, it's okay that I shouldn't say a word.
And it's okay that what I think is never heard.
But I'm looking at you to help me understand why it is okay
That I hide behind these words.

I know you and all you're thinking;
You know me; you know I'm sinking.

But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.",Look Out Tomorrow
Jesus Jones,"I never wrote a book like the ones I like to read
'Cause aiming for the stars, well, it brings me to my knees
I thought I handled sin when it was sin that handled me
When I thought I saw the light
I couldn't see the wood for the trees

There's a man on the moon
And he says that he's not coming down
But he's thinking of you every time the world spins around

I could never eat enough so I bit the hand that fed
Always talked too much but most was left unsaid

I lost friends and influenced no one
Announced the ending before it was over
Fought accusations that I was jaded
But I look at the stars and know their lights already faded",Man on the Moon [*]
Jesus Jones,"Reason you look for are reasons you find.
For climbing a mountain, for taking a gamble,
To leave it all behind.

Motion takes me.
I have to have motion; I get release in motion.
If I move I'll be fine.
I've got to hit the right speed to shake off what I don't need;
Be free from my mind.

Reasons you look for are reasons you find.

If I move I'll be fine.",Motion
Jesus Jones,"The next big thing
Life can be so calm
The next big thing
So calm without you

I am waiting for the next big thing
Bring it on quick time to me
I tap my fingers to the same old thing
And dream of better things to see

I couldn't tell you what path it comes by
I couldn't tell you if it's plain to see
I couldn't tell you if it's gonna change the world
But I hope to hell it's gonna change me

I am waiting for the next big thing
I'm scared of all that's behind me
All my faith is in the next big thing
It's where I'll hide what you don't see

I couldn't tell you what clothes it wears
I couldn't tell yo if it's black or white
I couldn't tell you if it's gonna change the world
But any change at all would be alright

Jesus Jones,"You live your life like it's on rails.
No choice where you go, you're on rails.

We stumble through
And I think I am linked up to you,
'Cause I can never think of you without this sorrow.

What can you do
In the face of all your dreams,
When your destination's never where it seemed, where it seemed.

We like to think that we choose our fortune,
Like spinning a wheel,
But with leaves on the track you tell me:
How does it feel?",Rails
Jesus Jones,"Don't look up too quick;
You'll see the sky is falling down on you,
And when you run on empty
The ground will wait to swallow you.

I have a dream returning every night.
The goal is out of reach but still in sight.
I'm getting thin but grinning every day.
I run on empty too much; it's just my way.

And in all your dreams, doesn't it seem
That you're wearing lead boots, growing tree roots, caught in quicksand?
I can see ahead; the end of the line.
This is some kind of meltdown, just in time.
I see declining empires fade away.
The games were getting ugly anyway.",Run on Empty
Jesus Jones,"He doesn't have a friend, just some occupations.
Staring at the sky or at computer screens.
It gets you in the neck, all this looking skywards.
But every martyr knows that you suffer in belief.

But if only you could see the things that he has seen!
'Cause he knows that he can tell you just what all this means.

He knows, it's true, that they're out there.
He knows, it's true, that they're out there.
And there's very little faith left in this world.

There's so much in the sky, it must be hiding something.
He thinks that he's prepared, and he's counting down the days.

And if only you could see the things that he has seen!
'Cause he's sure that he could tell you just what all this means.

It's so easy when we sneer,
And mock the faith that he holds dear,
But just like us, he's chasing dreams.

If you look hard enough then you'll see it clearly.
There's something that we need, always coming from the sky.

And there's very little faith left in this world.",They're Out There

I have to blind myself with the light
I have to get too close
To the things that hurt me the most

When I'm pushed and pulled without ever knowing...
Why does it seem
I'm falling apart
Just tell me where to start
Show me how we'll be
Together, together

If you fail at so much
Would it hurt to fail again?
And if you've lost your touch

I know
That you're going to save me in the end, in the end

Sail up the stream; travel so far,
But always get out of the boat.
Sail up the stream; travel far,
But always leave the boat.

Here in my hands; all that I could wish for.
Timebombed; stick around; see it all go up in smoke.
With these very hands I'll pull it all apart.
I know in the end it'll sound like some sad joke.

Jet by Day,"It's like the sick leading the blind, a trail leading kids to cliffs,
An infecting sound that won't comply, and a strangled girl who's losing feeling. 
The world around is basking her in baths of misdirected hurt. 
She never seems to fight her pain, as it seeps into the picture's frame. 
Passages read day and night, a holy focus not her sight. 
These people shelter,(language faults) and move with calculated tact,
But she keeps thinking the worst is coming.
The only problem with colder weather is the fatigue it leaves until spring. 
A tired face, with tired eyes complete with tired desires for any more fires to take the burn away. The damage has won, moreover she's gone. 
The past has marred her sweet heart.
Home's a place to go when people cross you, 
But home's a place too cold, where the road seems too long.
She's only dreaming in black and gray. 
Summer's past and with it her hopes. 
Anchors aren't lifting! Is nothing sacred,
Or needed? Chemicals turned catalysts. 
Her fears are choking her. Please girl wake up!
Where's your desire to fight this? The never-ending fever defeats her.",Framed
Jet Harris,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
Jet Harris,"There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon

I'm going to pick that rose 
And watch her as she grows in my garden
I'm going to pick that rose 
And watch her as she grows in my garden

(There is a rose in Spanish Harlem)
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la

Jet Lag Gemini,"I cannot take you
And you cannot take me
What am I to do
Without you under me
Outside it's cloudy and it smells like rain

...And I miss you!

Don't leave me hanging on
I will you save you from when it rains, when it snows

I do not feel home
When I'm not in your arms
I just feel alone
On the floor by your shoes
Outside it's cloudy and it smells like rain

...And I miss you!

Don't leave me hanging on
I will you save you from when it rains, when it snows

It rains",Don't Leave Me Hanging
Jet Lag Gemini,"It's twelve a.m.
This moment breaks my heart
And so I stitch my lips
From lip to lip so I can keep from you
There's not enough time, not enough
To find the cure, there is no cure
I know that she's not an option

I swear there's no emotion
I swear you've got the last shot
I swear there's no emotion
I know she is not an option

It's three a.m.
Your blood is thin, the aspirin's just setting in
And you can't feel and you can't feel and you can't
There is no cure for the fact I care
I know she's not an option

I swear there's no emotion
I swear you've got the last shot
I swear there's no emotion
I know she is not an option

I swear there's no emotion
I swear you've got the last shot

Jet Lag Gemini,"The thing I hate the most
About being a ghost is that no one believes in me
When I say ""death is near!""
And no one else can hear...
It's so frustrating to watch you go, don't you know

You're one of us now
You're one of us now

Look down and button up your shirt
Because no one's looking in your direction
Sometimes the world makes it hurt
But that's okay because you're geared for action
You're geared for action yeah!

All you want is more, so much more
Time before you have to leave this medium
And watch today just fade away...
Tomorrow comes to take its place
Everyday",Geared for Action
Jet Lag Gemini,"Why did I leave my room I'll never know
Be cool be strong be fun I guess it shows
Its useless to lie
I know its not right
Caught with red-eyes-wide-open when you feel like dancing...feel like dancing

Forever and ever we all had to wait
For something or nothing that you had to say
Dad lets keep this between us
Just take me home with you
And don't tell mom because she'll yell
Lets just keep this between us
Just take me home with you

If you would just shut up I can explain
You know that everybody makes mistakes
Its useless to lie
I'll pay with my life
Caught with red-eyes-wide-open when you feel like dancing...feel like dancing

I guess you were right
I should have listened better
Here is my message in a black-marked letter
Saying It's the end
Goodbye to all my friends
You know I hated them","Ready, Set, No"
Jet Lag Gemini,"You've got nothing to live for, you're a plague
A filthy fucking drain on the world and everything it holds
So I stopped talking to myself, it's getting old
I'm getting old like this song
So fall in line or fall apart and die

Just go, give up hope
Sink your boat along with you
So what you gonna do?

Oh, is it me or is your status sold at the mall
Or in your favorite store?
Where adolescent hypocrites would go to get clothed
And then get laid, as they creep their way
Into some girl that would feel vain if she said

Go, give up hope
Sink your boat along with you

Go, give up hope
Sink your boat along with you
So what you gonna do?

When you lose control
You'll get it when you lose it all
You'll get it, get it

Just go, give up hope
Sink your boat along with you

Go, give up hope
Sink your boat along with you
So what you gonna do?",The Bad Apples
Jet Lag Gemini,"Even though you want it
You really shouldn't think about it
Treason is a tar pit
It's so tacky to preserve alone

Can you live like a crow? There's your answer
As you pick at my bones with your friends and
Their barren tongues won't fill your lungs

Love tends to dry
(And you can find it in a heartbeat)
In hands that don't try
(And leave it tangled in the bed sheets)

Love tends to dry
(You burn your bridges in the backseat)
In hands that don't try
(And show up widowed on the high street)

Come on, say you've done it
Though we don't have to talk about it
The stains left on the carpet
Scream loud enough for all to know

Do your legs fail the floor? There's your answer
A mistake with a sword needs a ransom
But you've got no jazz to have the cash

Love tends to dry
(And you can find it in a heartbeat)
In hands that don't try

In hands that don't try

In a coat for assault, desperate and bleak
Oh, so bittersweet

Jet Lag Gemini,"I think I'm in need of a savior

The pennies of a dead man's eyes

Sly fox, you really tricked me
Now you've got me on a leash
Throw me a bone, just drive me home
Or give me something good to read

I am a nail stuck in a wall without a string
Around my neck tied to a frame
Vacant with no war to wage
Can't teach a boy what he don't wanna learn

Without a shoe pressing the pavement

Motherly it gently sings
In my headphones whispering
Making sure that I am not alone

Won't you take this with you to the end
When all your weapons fail
And there's no crew left to sail

Just climb the mast
And bring your best disguise, screaming
We won't surrender, we won't surrender
We won't surrender here, we have no fear

And when all of your dreams
Go belly up
It seems that you, you took a hit
And it's time to cash in all your chips

So keep your fingers crossed
And linger on, screaming
We won't surrender, we won't surrender
We won't surrender here, we have no fear

There's no hope

I'm so miserable without them
It's almost like they are here
I guess I picked the wrong week to start storming out

As seconds turn too blue for my blood
I can see it on your face
It's almost like I've displaced every single nerve
Pinches to unearth, those rotten words

Like winding roads to beaches
And every word I send your way
You feed it to the leeches

Why don't you just get it?
Can't you get it?
Call your bluff, I've had enough
Don't give up

I'm married to my work and there's no place
For a hungry heart like yours
And a temper I never quite tamed
Like sugar our bonds once pure now have dissolved

I can't dance, took a chance

Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep

They think it's a bear
People rave and they crave

With freezing rains melting and no trains running
And sad eyes passing in windows flimsy
And my seat rocking from legs not quite matching
Got passport, credit cards, a plane that I'm catching
Black Sunday falls one day too soon

The taxi that takes me will be moving so quickly
My suitcases simply too full for the closing
Of pants, shirts and kisses all packed in a hurry
Two best-selling paperbacks chosen at random
No sign of sales persons to whom I might hand them
Black Sunday falls one day too soon

And down at the airport are probably waiting
A few thousand passengers, overbooked seating
Time long suspended in transit lounge traumas
Connections broken and Special Branch watching
Conspicuously standing in holiday clothing
Black Sunday falls one day too soon

Pick up my feet and kick off my lethargy
Down to the gate with the old mood upon me
Get out and chase the small immortality
Born in the minute of my next returning
Impatient feet tapping and cigarette burning
Homecoming one day too soon

Back at the house there's a gray sky a-tumbling
Milk bottles piling on door steps a-crumbling
Curtains all drawn and cold water plumbing
Notepaper scribbles I read unbelieving
Saying how sorry, how sad was the leaving
One day too soon

Tomorrow is the one day I would change for a Monday

To set the white man free

""And so I'm dead"", the young man said 
Over the hill (not a wish away). 
My friends (as one) all stand aligned 
Although their taxis came too late. 
There was a rush along the Fulham Road. 
There was a hush in the Passion Play. 

Such a sense of glowing in the aftermath 
Ripe with rich attainments all imagined 
Sad misdeeds in disarray 
The sore thumb screams aloud, 
Echoing out of the Passion Play. 
All the old familiar choruses come crowding in a different key: 
Melodies decaying in sweet dissonance. 
There was a rush along the Fulham Road 
Into the Ever-passion Play. 

And who comes here to wish me well? 
A sweetly-scented angel fell. 
She laid her head upon my disbelief 
And bathed me with her ever-smile. 
And with a howl across the sand 
I go escorted by a band of gentlemen in leather bound 
NO-ONE (but someone to be found). 

All along the icy wastes there are faces smiling in the gloom. 
Roll up roll down, Feeling unwound? Step into the viewing room. 
The cameras were all around. We've got you taped; you're in the play. 
Here's your I.D. (Ideal for identifying one and all.) 
Invest your life in the memory bank; ours the interest and we thank you. 
The ice-cream lady wets her drawers, to see you in the passion play. 

Take the prize for instant pleasure, captain of the cricket team 
Public speaking in all weathers, a knighthood from a queen. 

All of your best friends' telephones never cooled from the heat of your hand. 
From your hand
There's a line in a front-page story, 13 horses that also-ran. 
Also ran
Climb in your old umbrella. Does it have a nasty tear in the dome? 
In the dome
But the rain only gets in sometimes and the sun never leaves you alone, 
You alone
You alone
You alone
You alone

Lover of the black and white it's your first night. 
The Passion Play, goes all the way, spoils your insight. 
Tell me how the baby's made, how the lady's laid, 
Why the old dog howls in sadness. 

And your little sister's immaculate virginity wings away 
On the bony shoulders of a young horse named George 
Who stole surreptitiously into her geography revision. 
(The examining body examined her body.) 

Actor of the low-high Q, let's hear your view. 
Peek at the lines upon your sleeves since your memory won't do. 
Tell me: how the baby's graded, how the lady's faded, 
Why the old dogs howl with madness.

The Story Of The Hare Who Lost His Spectacles
This is the story of the hare who lost his spectacles. 

Owl loved to rest quietly whilst no one was watching. 
Sitting on a fence one day, he was surprised when suddenly a kangaroo ran close by. 
Now this may not seem strange, but when Owl overheard Kangaroo whisper to no one in particular, 
""The hare has lost his spectacles,"" well, he began to wonder. 

Presently, the moon appeared from behind a cloud and there, lying on the grass was hare. 
In the stream that flowed by the grass a newt. 
And sitting astride a twig of a bush a bee. 

Ostensibly motionless, the hare was trembling with excitement, 
For without his spectacles he appeared completely helpless. 
Where were his spectacles? Could 
Someone have stolen them? Had he mislaid them? What was he to do? 

Bee wanted to help, and thinking he had the answer began: 
""You probably ate them thinking they were a carrot."" 
""No!"" interrupted Owl, who was wise. 
""I have good eye-sight, insight, and foresight. 
How could an intelligent hare make such a silly mistake?"" 
But all this time, Owl had been sitting on the fence, scowling! 

A Kangaroo were hopping mad at this sort of talk. 
She thought herself far superior in intelligence to the others. 
She was their leader, their guru. She had the answer: 
""Hare, you must go in search of the optician."" 
But then she realized that Hare was completely helpless without his spectacles. 
And so, Kangaroo loudly proclaimed, ""I can't send Hare in search of anything!"" 
""You can guru, you can!"" shouted Newt. 
""You can send him with Owl."" 
But Owl had gone to sleep. 
Newt knew too much to be stopped by so small a problem 
""You can take him in your pouch."" 
But alas, Hare was much too big to fit into Kangaroo's pouch. 

All this time, it had been quite plain to hare that the others knew nothing about spectacles. 
As for all their tempting ideas, well Hare didn't care. 
The lost spectacles were his own affair. 
And after all, Hare did have a spare a-pair. 
A-pair. 
 
The end
We sleep by the ever-bright hole in the door, 
Eat in the corner, talk to the floor, 
Cheating the spiders who come to say ""Please"", 
(politely). They bend at the knees. 
Well, I'll go to the foot of our stairs. 
Old gentlemen talk of when they were young 
Of ladies lost, of erring sons. 
Lace-covered dandies revel (with friends) 
Pure as the truth, tied at both ends. 
Well I'll go to the foot of our stairs. 
Scented cathedral spire pointed down. 
We pray for souls in Kentish Town. 
A delicate hush the gods, floating by 
Wishing us well, pie in the sky.

Of love-hungry pilgrims (no bodies to feed). 
Show me a good man and I'll show you the door. 
The last hymn is sung and the devil cries ""More."" 

Well, I'm all for leaving and that being done, 
I've put in a request to take up my turn 
In that forsaken paradise that calls itself ""Hell"" 
Where no-one has nothing and nothing is- well -meaning fool, 
Pick up thy bed and rise up from your gloom smiling. 
Give me your hate and do as the loving heathen do. 

Colours I've none dark or light, red, white or blue. 
Cold is my touch (freezing). 

Summoned by name - I am the overseer over you. 
Given this command to watch o'er our miserable sphere. 
Fallen from grace, called on to bring sun or rain. 
Occasional corn from my oversight grew. 
Fell with mine angels from a far better place, 
Offering services for the saving of face. 
Now you're here, you may as well admire 
All whom living has retired from the benign reconciliation. 
Legends were born surrounding mysterious lights 
Seen in the sky (flashing). 
I just lit a fag then took my leave in the blink of an eye.

(primitive rite) (wrongly). 
Summoned by name I am the overseer over you. 

Flee the icy Lucifer. Oh he's an awful fellow! 
What a mistake! I didn't take a feather from his pillow. 
Here's the everlasting rub: neither am I good or bad. 
I'd give up my halo for a horn and the horn for the hat I once had. 
I'm only breathing. There's life on my ceiling. 
The flies there are sleeping quietly. 
Twist my right arm in the dark. 
I would give two or three for 
One of those days that never made 
Impressions on the old score. 
I would gladly be a dog barking up the wrong tree. 
Everyone's saved we're in the grave. 
See you there for afternoon tea. 
Time for awaking the tea lady's making 
A brew-up and baking new bread. 
Pick me up at half past none 
There's not a moment to lose. 
There is the train on which I came. 
On the platform are my old shoes. 
Station master rings his bell. 
Whistles blow and flags wave. 
A little of what you fancy does you good (Or so it should). 
I thank everybody 
For making me welcome. 
I'd stay but my wings have just dropped off. 

Hail! Son of kings make the ever-dying sign 
Cross your fingers in the sky for those about to BE. 
There am I waiting along the sand. 

Cast your sweet spell upon the land and sea. 
Magus Perde, take your hand from off the chain. 
Loose a wish to still, the rain, the storm about to BE. 
Here am I (voyager into life). 
Tough are the soles that tread the knife's edge. 
Break the circle,stretch the line, call upon the devil. 
Bring the gods, the gods' own fire. 
In the conflict revel. 
The passengers upon the ferry crossing, waiting to be born, 
Renew the pledge of life's long song rise to the reveille horn. 
Animals queueing at the gate that stands upon the shore 
Breathe the ever-burning fire that guards the ever-door. 

Man, son of man, buy the flame of ever-life 
(yours to breathe and breath the pain of living): living BE! 
Here am I! Roll the stone away 
From the dark into ever-day.

Jethro Tull,"Through northern lights on back streets 
I told the coachman, ""Just drive me on,
It's the same old destination
But a different world to sing upon.''
So he threw back his head and he counted.
I jumped out about five to nine.

And I waved at the stage door-keeper 
Said, ""Mister, get me to the stage on time.''
Oh, but the rain wasn't made of water
And the snow didn't have a place in the sun
So I slipped behind a rainbow
And waited till the show had done.

I packed my ammunition.
Inside the crowd was shouting, ""Encore'',

But I had a most funny feeling 
It wasn't me they were shouting for.
So when the tall dark lady smiled at me
I said, ""Oh, baby let us go for a ride.''
And we came upon two drinks or four
And popped them oh so neatly inside.

Oh, but the rain wasn't made of water
And the snow didn't have a place in the sun
So we slipped behind a rainbow
And lay there until we had done.

Jethro Tull,"Well, I saw a bird today
Flying from a bush
And the wind blew it away.
And the black-eyed mother sun
Scorched the butterfly at play
Velvet veined. I saw it burn.
With a wintry storm-blown sigh,
A silver cloud blew right on by.
And, taking in the morning, I sang
O Requiem.

Well, my lady told me, ""Stay.""
I looked aside and walked away
Along the strand.
But I didn't say a word,
As the train time-table blurred
Close behind the taxi stand.
Saw her face in the tear-drop black cab window.
Fading into the traffic; watched her go.
And taking in the morning,
Heard myself singing 
O Requiem.
Here I go again.
It's the same old story.

But you'd only drift right back 
To your Rock Island.

In your pomp and all your glory you're a poorer man than me,

Jethro Tull,"Wondering aloud 
How we feel today
Last night sipped the sunset 
My hand in her hair
We are our own saviours
As we start both our hearts beating life 
Into each other

Wondering aloud 
Will the years treat us well
As she floats in the kitchen,
I'm tasting the smell
Of toast as the butter runs
Then she comes, spilling crumbs on the bed

With their God tucked underneath my arm
Their half-assed smiles and the book of rules

Supporting their farflung illusion, the national curse,
And those with no sandwiches please get off the bus.

And the brainwashing government lackeys would have us say

The natural resources are dwinding and no one grows old
And those with no homes to go to, please pick yourself holes.

Searched for the last pigeon, slate gray I've been told.
Stumbled on a daffodil which she crushed in the rush,
Heard it sigh and left it to die.

Held its poor broken head in her hands, dropped soft tears in the snow
And it's only the taking that makes you what you are.

You were kissed by a witch one night in the wood,
And later insisted your feelings were true.

The witches promise was coming,
Believing he listened while laughing you flew.

Leaves falling, red, yellow, brown, all look the same,
And the love you had found lay outside in the rain,
Washed clean by the water but nursing its pain.
The witches promise was coming,
And you're looking elsewhere for your own selfish gain.

Keep looking, keep looking for somewhere to be,
Well, you're wasting your time, they not stupid like he is.
Meanwhile leaves are still falling, you're too blind to see.
You won't find it easy now, it's only fair.

Jethro Tull,"Really don't mind if you sit this one out
My word's but a whisper your deafness a shout
I may make you feel but I can't make you think
Your sperm's in the gutter your love's in the sink
So you ride yourselves over the fields
And you make all your animal deals
And your wise men don't know how it feels
To be thick as a brick

And the sandcastle virtues are all swept away
In the tidal destruction the moral melee
The elastic retreat rings the close of play
As the last wave uncovers the newfangled way
But your new shoes are worn at the heels
And your suntan does rapidly peel
And your wise men don't know how it feels
To be thick as a brick
And the love that I feel is so far away:
I'm a bad dream that I just had today
And you shake your head
And said it's a shame

Spin me back down the years and the days of my youth
Draw the lace and black curtains and shut out the whole truth
Spin me down the long ages, let them sing the song

See there, a son is born and we pronounce him fit to fight
There are blackheads on his shoulders, and he pees himself in the night
We'll make a man of him, put him to trade
Teach him to play Monopoly and how to sing in the rain

The poet and the painter casting shadows on the water
As the sun plays on the infantry returning from the sea
The do-er and the thinker, no allowance for the other
As the failing light illuminates the mercenary's creed
The home fire burning, the kettle almost boiling
But the master of the house is far away
The horses stamping, their warm breath clouding
In the sharp and frosty morning of the day
And the poet lifts his pen while the soldier sheaths his sword
And the youngest of the family is moving with authority
Building castles by the sea, he dares the tardy tide to wash them all aside

The cattle quietly grazing at the grass down by the river
Where the swelling mountain water moves onward to the sea:
The builder of the castles renews the age-old purpose
And contemplates the milking girl whose offer is his need
The young men of the household have all gone into service
And are not to be expected for a year
The innocent young master, thoughts moving ever faster
Has formed the plan to change the man he seems
And the poet sheaths his pen while the soldier lifts his sword
And the oldest of the family is moving with authority
Coming from across the sea, he challenges the son
Who puts him to the run

What do you do when the old man's gone, ddo you want to be him?
And your real self sings the song, do you want to free him?
No one to help you get up steam
And the whirlpool turns you way off-beam

I've come down from the upper class to mend your rotten ways
My father was a man of power whom everyone obeyed
So come on all you criminals! I've got to put you straight
Just like I did with my old man twenty years too late

Your bread and water's going cold, your hair is short and neat
I'll judge you all and make damn sure that no-one judges me

You curl your toes in fun as you smile at everyone
You meet the stares, you're unaware that your doings aren't done
And you laugh most ruthlessly as you tell us what not to be
But how are we supposed to see where we should run?

Of your love and the cut of the knife

The pavements ar empty, the gutters run red while the fool toasts his god in the sky

And join your voices in a hellish chorus
Mark the precise nature of your fear

Let me help you pick up your dead
As the sins of the father are fed
With the blood of the fools and the thoughts of the wise
And from the pan under your bed
Well, let me make you a present of song
As the wise man breaks wind and is gone
While the fool with the hour-glass is cooking his goose and the nursery rhyme winds along

So come all ye young men who are building castles
Kindly state the time of the year
And join your voices in a hellish chorus
Mark the precise nature of your fear
See the summer lightning casts its bolts upon you
And the hour of judgement draweth near
Would you be the fool stood in his suit of armour or the wiser man who rushes clear?

And you place your final burden
On your hard-pressed next of kin:
Send the chamber-pot back down the line
To be filled up again.

And the hard-headed miracle worker
Who bathes his hands in blood,
Will welcome you to the final ""nod""
And cover you with mud.
And he'll say, ""You really should make the deal,""
As he offers round the hat.
""Well, you'd better lick two fingers clean
He'll thank you all for that.""
As you slip on the greasy platform,
And you land upon your back,
You make a wish and you wipe your nose
Upon the railway track.
While the high-strung locomotive,
With furnace burning bright,
Lumbers on you wave goodbye
And the sparks fade into night.

And as you join the Good Ship Earth,
And you mingle with the dust,
You'd better leave your underpants
With someone you can trust.
And when the Old Man with the telescope
Cuts the final strand
You'd better lick two fingers clean,
Before you shake his hand.",Two Fingers

Jethro Tull,"Come, let me play with you, black satin dancer.
In all your giving, given is the answer.
Tearing life from limb and looking sweeter
than the brightest flower in my garden.
Begging your pardon shedding right unreason.
Over sensation fly the fleeting seasons.
Thin wind whispering on broken mandolin.
Bending the minutes the hours ever turning
on that old gold story of mercy:
desperate breathing, tongue nipple-teasing.
Your fast river flowing your northern fire fed.
Come, black satin dancer, come softly to bed.",Black Satin Dancer
Jethro Tull,"Really don't mind if you sit this one out.
My words but a whisper -- your deafness a shout.
I may make you feel but I can't make you think.
Your sperm's in the gutter -- your love's in the sink.
So you ride yourselves over the fields and
You make all your animal deals and
Your wise men don't know how it feels to be thick as a brick.
And the sand-castle virtues are all swept away in
The tidal destruction
The moral melee.
The elastic retreat rings the close of play as the last wave uncovers
The newfangled way.
But your new shoes are worn at the heels and
Your suntan does rapidly peel and
Your wise men don't know how it feels to be thick as a brick.
And the love that I feel is so far away:
I'm a bad dream that I just had today -- and you
Shake your head and
Say it's a shame.
Spin me back down the years and the days of my youth.
Draw the lace and black curtains and shut out the whole truth.
Spin me down the long ages: let them sing the song.
See there! a son is born -- and we pronounce him fit to fight.
There are black-heads on his shoulders, and he pees himself in the night.
We'll
Make a man of him
Put him to trade
Teach him
To play monopoly and
To sing in the rain.
The poet and the painter casting shadows on the water --
As the sun plays on the infantry returning from the sea.
The do-er and the thinker: no allowance for the other --
As the failing light illuminates the mercenary's creed.
The home fire burning: the kettle almost boiling --
But the master of the house is far away.
The horses stamping -- their warm breath clouding
In the sharp and frosty morning of the day.
And the poet lifts his pen while the soldier sheaths his sword.
And the youngest of the family is moving with authority.
Building castles by the sea, he dares the tardy tide to wash them all aside.
The cattle quietly grazing at the grass down by the river
Where the swelling mountain water moves onward to the sea:
The builder of the castles renews the age-old purpose
And contemplates the milking girl whose offer is his need.
The young men of the household have
All gone into service and
Are not to be expected for a year.
The innocent young master -- thoughts moving ever faster --
Has formed the plan to change the man he seems.
And the poet sheaths his pen while the soldier lifts his sword.
And the oldest of the family is moving with authority.
Coming from across the sea, he challenges the son who puts him to the run.
What do you do when
The old man's gone -- do you want to be him? and
Your real self sings the song.
Do you want to free him? 
No one to help you get up steam --
And the whirlpool turns you `way off-beam.
Later.
I've come down from the upper class to mend your rotten ways.
My father was a man-of-power whom everyone obeyed.
So come on all you criminals!
I've got to put you straight just like I did with my old man --
Twenty years too late.
Your bread and water's going cold.
Your hair is too short and neat.
I'll judge you all and make damn sure that no-one judges me.
You curl your toes in fun as you smile at everyone -- you meet the stares.
You're unaware that your doings aren't done.
And you laugh most ruthlessly as you tell us what not to be.
But how are we supposed to see where we should run? 
I see you shuffle in the courtroom with
Your rings upon your fingers and
Your downy little sidies and
Your silver-buckle shoes.
Playing at the hard case, you follow the example of the comic-paper idol
Who lets you bend the rules.
So!
Come on ye childhood heroes!
Won't you rise up from the pages of your comic-books
Your super crooks
And show us all the way.
Well! make your will and testament. won't you? 
Join your local government.
We'll have superman for president
Let robin save the day.
You put your bet on number one and it comes up every time.
The other kids have all backed down and they put you first in line.
And so you finally ask yourself just how big you are --
And take your place in a wiser world of bigger motor cars.
And you wonder who to call on.
So! where the hell was biggles when you needed him last saturday? 
And where were all the sportsmen who always pulled you though? 
They're all resting down in cornwall --
Writing up their memoirs for a paper-back edition
Of the boy scout manual.
Later.
See there! a man born -- and we pronounce him fit for peace.
There's a load lifted from his shoulders with the discovery of his disease.
We'll
Take the child from him
Put it to the test
Teach it
To be a wise man
How to fool the rest.

Later
In the clear white circles of morning wonder,
I take my place with the lord of the hills.
And the blue-eyed soldiers stand slightly discoloured (in neat little rows)
Sporting canvas frills.
With their jock-straps pinching, they slouch to attention,
While queueing for sarnies at the office canteen.
Saying -- how's your granny and
Good old ernie: he coughed up a tenner on a premium bond win.
The legends (worded in the ancient tribal hymn) lie cradled
In the seagull's call.
And all the promises they made are ground beneath the sadist's fall.
The poet and the wise man stand behind the gun,
And signal for the crack of dawn.
Light the sun.
Do you believe in the day? do you? 
Believe in the day! the dawn creation of the kings has begun.
Soft venus (lonely maiden) brings the ageless one.
Do you believe in the day? 
The fading hero has returned to the night -- and fully pregnant with the day,
Wise men endorse the poet's sight.
Do you believe in the day? do you? believe in the day!
Let me tell you the tales of your life of
Your love and the cut of the knife
The tireless oppression
The wisdom instilled
The desire to kill or be killed.
Let me sing of the losers who lie in the street as the last bus goes by.
The pavements are empty: the gutters run red -- while the fool
Toasts his God in the sky.
So come all ye young men who are building castles!
Kindly state the time of the year and join your voices in a hellish chorus.
Mark the precise nature of your fear.
Let me help you pick up your dead as the sins of the father are fed
With
The blood of the fools and
The thoughts of the wise and
From the pan under your bed.
Let me make you a present of song as
The wise man breaks wind and is gone while
The fool with the hour-glass is cooking his goose and
The nursery rhyme winds along.
So! come all ye young men who are building castles!
Kindly state the time of the year and join your voices in a hellish chorus.
Mark the precise nature of your fear.
See! the summer lightning casts it's bolts upon you
And the hour of judgement draweth near.
Would you be
The fool stood in his suit of armour or
The wiser man who rushes clear.
So! come on ye childhood heroes!
Won't your rise up from the pages of your comic-books
Your super-crooks and
Show us all the way.
Well! make your will and testament.
Won't you? join your local government.

And doted on the daughter in the ministry of youth?
Thrust your head between the breasts of the fertile innocent.
And taken up the cause of love, for the sake of argument.
Or while the kisses drop like a fall of shot
From soft lips in the rain 
Come a beltane.

Happy old new year to you and yours.
The sun's up for one more day, to be sure.
Play it out gladly, for your card's marked again.

Have you walked around your parks and towns so knife-edged orderly?
While the fires are burned on the hills upturned
In far-off wild country.
And felt the chill on your window sill
As the green man comes around.
With his walking cane of sweet hazel brings it crashing down.
Sends your knuckles white as the thin stick bites.

And August's rare delight may be April's fool.

Jethro Tull,"Meanwhile back in the year One,
When you belonged to no-one,
You didn't stand a chance son,
If your pants were undone.
'Cause you were bred for humanity 
And sold to society 
One day you'll wake up
In the Present Day 
A million generations removed from expectations of being who you really want to be.
Skating away, skating away,
Skating away on the thin ice of the New Day.

So as you push off from the shore,
Won't you turn your head once more
And make your peace with everyone?
For those who choose to stay,
Will live just one more day 
To do the things they should have done.
And as you cross the wilderness,
Spinning in your emptiness:
You feel you have to pray.
Looking for a sign that the Universal Mind has written you into the Passion Play.
Skating away, skating away,
Skating away on the thin ice of the New Day.

And as you cross the circle line,
The ice-wall creaks behind 
You're a rabbit on the run.
And the silver splinters fly
In the corner of your eye 
Shining in the setting sun.
Well, do you ever get the feeling that the story's too damn real and in the present tense?
Or that everybody's on the stage, and it seems like you're the only person
Sitting in the audience?
Skating away, skating away,
Skating away on the thin ice of the New Day.

In all good places
Under black mountains
In open spaces.
By deep brown rivers
That slither darkly
Through far marches
Where the blue hare races.

Come with me to the Winged Isle
Northern father's western child.
Where the dance of ages is playing still
Through far marches of acres wild.

In narrow side streets
With shuttered windows,
Crumbling chimneys.

On concrete marches of acres wild.

Jethro Tull,"Muscled, black with steel green eye
Swishing through the rye grass
With thoughts of mouse and apple pie
Tail balancing at half-mast

And the mouse police never sleeps
Lying in the cherry tree
Savage bed foot warmer
Of purest feline ancestry

Look out, little furry folk
He's the all night working cat
Eats but one in every ten
Leaves the others on the mat

And the mouse police never sleeps
Waiting by the cellar door
Window-box town crier
Birth and death registrar

With claws that rake a furrow red
Licensed to mutilate
From warm milk on a lazy day
To dawn patrol on hungry hate

No, the mouse police never sleeps
Climbing on the ivy
Windy roof top weathercock
Warm blooded night on a cold tile

Battlefield allotments. Fresh open sores.

Like a faithful dog with master
Sleeping in the draught beside the carriage door.

Cold supper nearing with each station stop.
Frosty flakes on empty platforms
Fireside slippers waiting. Flip. Flop.

Too late to stop for tea at Gerard's Cross
And hear the soft shoes on the footbridge shuffle
As the wheels turn biting on the midnight frost.

Stares.

At the cocktail party with a Bucks Fizz in my hand
I feel him watching me watching the girls go by.
And they move so smooth without even trying.
He's still watching me watching you
Watching the trains go by.

And the crowd thins and he moves up close but he doesn't speak.
I have to look the other way.
But curiosity gets the better part of me and I peek:
Got two drinks in his hand see his lips move 
What the hell's he trying to say?

He's watching me watching you watching him watching me.
I'm watching you watching him watching me watching.

Jethro Tull,"Sailing round the true-blue sphere
Is it too late to bale out of here?
Well, there has to be some better way
To turn back the night,
Spin on to yesterday.

The old man and his crew
After all these years,
It's apogee.
Pilot training and remorse
Spirit friends fly too,
At apogee.
Apogee...solar bright.
Apogee...through the night.
Apogee...overground.
Don't think I'll be coming down.

Screened for a stable mate
With nerves of ice we flew,
At apogee.
No creativity allowed
To pass through stainless veins of steel,
At apogee.
Apogee...put the kettle on.
Tight-lipped...soldier on.
High point...communicate.
Don't forget to urinate.

So glad they put this window in.
How to explain, how to begin?
See! Tennyson and Wordsworth there
Waiting for me in the cold, thin air.

Beware a host of unearthly daffodils
Drifting golden, turned up loud.
Tell the boys back home,
I'm gonna get some.

The wrong stuff's loose in here 
I'm climbing up the walls,
At apogee.
So hoist the skull and bones 
Death and glory's free,
At apogee.

A stranger wind, a solar breeze 
I'm walking out upon the starry seas.
See pyramids, see standing stones 
Pink cotton undies and blue telephones.

Sit back, relax and count the stars.",Apogee

In red-light claustrophobia.
I slip the shackles, cut the rope 
Stand naked with a telescope
As the cat walks alone
Under a big sky.
Against the dark so thin and white 
Gonna be a big sky night.

Miss Galileo, come with me
And view the new Astronomy.
Black hole dressing on salad plate
Quasar at the kissing gate
Now the cat, he walks alone
Under a big sky.
Umbrella dome pin-pricked in lights 
Gonna be a big sky night.

My spectacles, my white lab coat 
My coffee, thermos and my notes.
I pat my pockets. I got the keys
To the secrets of the observatory.
And closing the door,
I feel a new dawn
As the darker slides align 
You to yours and me to mine.

And now you stand, assisting me 
I can touch what I can see, see, see.
I look in wonder, I feel no shame 
See the consequences of the game.
Expand the universe.

Reach for my switch and shout 
Gonna turn the big sky out.

You make all your animal deals and

The tidal destruction
The moral melee.
The elastic retreat rings the close of play
As the last wave uncovers

Your suntan does rapidly peel and

Maybe a student of the agricultural plan
Hey Moscow, what's your name? If you don't wanna say, don't worry
It would probably be hard for me to make it scan

With her phrase book in her silk soft hand
She spoke in riddles while the vodka listened
I said, ""Let me look up love, if I might be so bold''

She was the nearest thing to rock and roll
That side of the velvet curtain
That separates eastern steel from western gold

Hey Miss Moscow, what's your story?
You needn't speak aloud, just whisper
Am I just the closest thing to an Englishman?
You've seen me in your magazines, or maybe on state television
I'm your Pepsi Cola but you won't take me out the can

She said she was a dancer, so she did

She said she was a dancer, if I believed it, it was my business
It felt like a merry dance that I was being led

And mealy-mouthed
Through corridors of power on tip-toe creep.

Families screaming line the streets
And put the windows through
In corner shops

A deathly distant rumble
To Titanic-breaking children lost
In melting crystal tears.

Capturing black pieces
In a glass-fronted museum
The white queen rolls
On the chessboard of the dawn

Squeezing through the valleys
Pausing briefly in the corries
The Ice-Mother mates
And a new age is born.

Driving all before her
Un-stoppable, un-straining
Her cold creaking mass
Follows reindeer down.

Thin spreading fingers seek
To embrace the sill-warm bundles
That huddle on the doorsteps
Of a white London Town.

Oh, sunshine take me now away from here
I'm a needle on a spiral in a groove.
And the turntable spins
As the last waltz begins

And the weather-man says
Something's on the move.",Something's on the Move
Jethro Tull,"I remember when we had a lot of things to do 
Impressed by all the words we read 
And the heroes that we knew. 
Climb on your your dream, a dream of our own making 
To find a place that we could later lose 
To whatever time would bring. 

We were seventeen and the cakeman was affecting you
Moving you to greater things (in a lesser way) 
You had to prove. 
The clock struck summertime. You were going round in circles now. 
Wishing you were seventeen. At twenty-one, it was a long time gone. 
And now here you are. You're locked in your own excuse. 
The circle's getting smaller every day. 
You're busy planning the next fifty years. 
So stay the way you are and keep your head down to the same old ground. 
Just paint your picture boy until you find 
A closed circle's better than an open line. 

Yes stay the way you are. I got a circle that's the same as yours. 
It may be bigger, but I've more to lose.

And called the new year in
While are the phantoms of three thousand years
Rise as the dead leaves spin?
There's a snap in the grass behind your feet
And a tap upon your shoulder,
And the thin wind crawls along your neck;
It's just the old gods getting older.
And the Kestral drops like a far-off shot
From a red cloud hanging high.

Of the old elastic truth,
And doted on the daughter

For the sake of [???].
While the kisses drop like a far-off shot
From soft lips in the rain.

And you're the sons of for one more day

Have you walked around your parks and town
So [nice and?] orderly,
While the fires are burned on the hills upturned
In far-off wild country,
And felt the chill on your windowsill
As the green man comes around
With his walking cane of sweet hazel
Brings it crashing down,
Sends your knuckles white as the thin stick bites?
But its just your groaning pains.

Mayhem in the high degree.

The blacksmith chased us all to ground.
They searched all night --- we were never found.
The tinker boys and the sheriff's men
Shaking the tallest tree.
And we sat and watched the women hide.
Laughed so much we split our sides.
Scattered horses that they would ride ---
Mayhem in the high degree.

We crossed through fields of midnight green
Often heard but seldom seen.
Tore along hedges,stripping leaves ---
No-one could quite agree
Whether we came from north or south.
We stole the screams from out their mouths
And go where no man would allow
Mayhem in the high degree.

Like scaly carp and feathered swan
To nature's world we do belong.

And set dark spirits free.
We terrify the mare and foal.

Got some lead-free in my tank.

I'm bound for the mainland.

Island in the city, cut by a cold sea.
People moving on an ocean. 
Groundswell of humanity.
Now the sum breaks through rain 
As I climb Glen Shiel
On the trail of those old cattlemen 
Who drove their bargain south again.
And in the eyes of those five, 
Five sisters of Kintail
There's a wink of seduction from the mainland.

Storm-lashed on the high-rise,

Blown like silent laughter.

Take my heart and take my brawn.
Take by stealth or take by storm
Set my brain to cruise.
I can see the glow of the suburb lights.
I'm fresh from the out-world
Singing the mainland blues.

There was a girl where I came from.
Seems a long time, long time, long time gone by.
Wears the west wind in her hair.
She calls from the hill, yeah, 
She calls in my mainland blues.

There's a coast road that winds 
To heaven's door
Where a fat ferry floats 
On muted diesel roar.
And there's a light on the hillside 
And there's a flame in her eyes,
But how cold the lights burn on the mainland.

Like a telegraph line.

Pouring heavy water on me, heavy water.

She was a southern girl. 
We stared man to man.
I move like a stranger
In this strange land.
She was a round hole, 
I was a square peg.
I watched the little black specks 
Running down her leg.
Didn't seem to mind 
That dirty rain coming down
Shirt hanging open. 
She was wet and brown.
Thumping in my heart, 
And it's hurting me to see.

Shall I make us both feel good? 
And would a dollar do?
But in your streets, I have no credit rating
And it might not take a lot to be alone just like you.

Find a landing strip.

Cold-eyed march towards the dawn behind hard-weather hoods a-hiding.

From pilots in the fast lane.

Talk in confidential terms, share a dark unspoken fear.

It made a perfect window to her heart.
I could have moved among her waterfalls:

Felt like I was taking her to market now
To be sold as the last lot of the day.

I could have warmed them, but the moment wasn't right.
Obvious, she was headed nowhere special:
Yes, well it was even obvious to me.
I was doing some, some watching, some waiting:
She'd been here before, most definitely.
There was the promise of early bed-time.
There was the promise of heaven on earth.
Think I was sending out low-voltage electricity:
Played it right down for what it was worth.

When you can sing the song to make me glad.
So when you look into the sun
And see the words you could have sung:
It's not too late, only begun,
We can still make summer.
Yes, summer always comes anyway.

Jethro Tull,"A one, two, three.
There's a haze on the skyline, to wish me on my way -
And there's a note on the telephone - some roses on a tray.
And the motorway's stretching right out to us all, as I pull on my old
Wings - one white duck on your wall.
Isn't it just too damn real? one white duck on your wall.
One duck on your wall.

I'll catch a ride on your violin - strung upon your bow.
And I'll float on your melody - sing your chorus soft and low.
There's a picture-view postcard to say that I called.
You can see from the fireplace, one white duck on your wall.
Isn't it just too damn real? one white duck on your wall.
One duck on your wall.

So fly away peter and fly away Paul - from the finger-tip ledge of contentment.
The long restless rustle of high heel boots calls.
And I'm probably bound to deceive you after all.
Something must be wrong with me and my brain - if I'm so patently unrewarding.
But my dreams are for dreaming and best left that way - and my zero to your
Power of ten equals nothing at all.

There's no double-lock defense; there's no chain on my door.
And I'm available for consultation,
But remember your way in is also my way out, and love's four-letter word is
No compensation.

Well, I'm the black ace dog handler: I'm a waiter on skates - so don't you

Because I'm up to my deaf ears in cold breakfast trays 
To be cleared before I can dine on your sweet Sunday lunch confusion.",One White Duck

That's not what I'm chasing. I was a rich man before yesterday.
Now all I have got is a cheque and a pickup truck.
I left my farm on the freeway.

Silicon chip factory on the east.
And the big road's pushing through along the valley floor.
Hot machine pouring six lanes at the very least.

Now all I have left is a broken-down pickup truck.

Closed down for the winter and whispered names.

That this is not love.
No, this is not love.

Empty drugstore postcards freeze
Sunburst images of summers gone.
Think I see us in these promenade days
Before we learned October's song.
Out on the headland, one gale-whipped tree;
Curious, head bent to see.
And how come you know better than me
That this is not love.

How come you know better than me
How come you know better than me

Counting all his money.
Sister's sitting by the mirror 
She thinks her hair looks funny.

And here am I thinking to myself
Just wondering what things to do.

I think I enjoyed all my problems
Where didn't I get nothing for free.
Oh, I'm going back to the family 
Doing nothing is bothering me.

I'll get a train back to the city

There's more fun away from the family

With freezing rains melting and no trains running
And sad eyes passing in windows flimsy
And my seat rocking from legs not quite matching,
Got passport, credit cards, a plane that I'm catching
Black Sunday falls one day too soon.

The taxi that takes me will be moving too quickly
My suitcases simply too full for the closing
Of pants, shirts and kisses all packed in a hurry,
Two best-selling paper backs chosen at random 
No sign of sales-persons to whom I might hand them.
Black Sunday falls one day too soon.

And down at the airport are probably waiting
A few thousand passengers, overbooked seating
Time long suspended in transit-lounge traumas
Connections broken and Special Branch waiting
Conspicuously standing in holiday clothing.
Black Sunday falls one day too soon.

Pick up my feet and kick off my lethargy,
Down to the gate with the old mood upon me,
Get out and chase the small immortality
Born in the minute of my next returning
Impatient feet tapping and cigarette burning.
Homecoming one day too soon.

And back at the house there's a grey sky a-tumbling,
Milk bottles piling on door steps a-crumbling,
Curtains all drawn and cold water plumbing
Notepaper scribbles I read unbelieving
Saying how sorry, how sad was the leaving one day too soon.

Jethro Tull,"I think she was a middle-distance runner...
(The translation wasn't clear).
Could be a budding stately hero.
International competition in a year.
She was a good enough reason for a party...
(Well, you couldn't keep up on a hard track mile)
While she ran a perfect circle.
And she wore a perfect smile
In Budapest... hot night in Budapest.

We had to cozzy up in the old gymnasium...
Dusting off the mandolins and checking on the gear.
She was helping out at the back-stage...
Stopping hearts and chilling beer.
Yes, and her legs went on for ever.
Like staring up at infinity
Through a wisp of cotton panty
Along a skin of satin sea.
Hot night in Budapest.

You could cut the heat, peel it back with the wrong side of a knife.
Feel it blowing from the sidefills. Feel like you were playing for your life
(If not the money).
Hot night in Budapest.

She bent down to fill the ice box
And stuffed some more warm white wine in
Like some weird unearthly vision
Wearing only T-shirt, pants and skin.
You know, it rippled, just a hint of muscle.
But the boys and me were heading west
So we left her to the late crew
And a hot night in Budapest.
It was a hot night in Budapest.

She didn't speak much English language...
(She didn't speak much anyway).
She wouldn't make love, but she could make good sandwich
And she poured sweet wine before we played.

Hey, Budapest, cha, cha, cha. Let's watch her now.

I thought I saw her at the late night restaurant.
She would have sent blue shivers down the wall.
But she didn't grace our table.
In fact, she wasn't there at all.
Yes, and her legs went on forever.
Like staring up at infinity.
Her heart was spinning to the west-lands

Jethro Tull,"Walking through forests of palm tree apartments
Scoff at the monkeys who live in their dark tents
Down by the waterhole
Drunk every Friday
Eating their nuts
Saving their raisins for Sunday.
Lions and tigers
Who wait in the shadows
They're fast but they're lazy, and sleep in green meadows

Let's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me
I'm a tiger when I want love
But I'm a snake if we disagree

Just say a word and the boys will be right there
With claws at your back to send a chill through the night air
Is it so frightening to have me at your shoulder?
Thunder and lightning couldn't be bolder
I'll write on your tombstone,I thank you for dinner
This game that we animals play is a winner

Let's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me
I'm a tiger when I want love
But I'm a snake if we disagree

The rivers are full of crocodile nastiest
And He who made kittens put snakes in the grass
He's a lover of life but a player of pawns
Yes, the King on His sunset lies waiting for dawn
To light up His Jungle as play is resumed
The monkeys seem willing to strike up the tune

An October's day, towards evening,
Sweat embossed veins standing proud to the plough,
Salt on a deep chest seasoning.
Last of the line at an honest day's toil,
Turning the deep sod under,
Flint at the fetlock, chasing the bone,
Flies at the nostrils plunder.

With the Shire on his feathers floating.
Hauling soft timber into the dusk
To bed on a warm straw coating.

To keep the old line going.
And we'll stand you abreast at the back of the wood
Behind the young trees growing.
To hide you from eyes that mock at your girth,
And your eighteen hands at the shoulder.
And one day when the oil barons have all dripped dry
And the nights are seen to draw colder
They'll beg for your strength, your gentle power
Your noble grace and your bearing.
And you'll strain once again to the sound of the gulls
In the wake of the deep plough, sharing.

Standing like tanks on the brow of the hill
Up into the cold wind facing
In stiff battle harness, chained to the world
Against the low sun racing.
Bring me a wheel of oaken wood
A rein of polished leather
A Heavy Horse and a tumbling sky
Brewing heavy weather.

Bring a song for the evening
Clean brass to flash the dawn
Across these acres glistening
Like dew on a carpet lawn.
In these dark towns folk lie sleeping
As the heavy horses thunder by
To wake the dying city
With the living horseman's cry.
At once the old hands quicken,
Bring pick and wisp and curry comb,
Thrill to the sound of all
The heavy horses coming home.",Heavy Horses

Gonna give away my car.
I'd take you along with me,
But you would not go so far.
Don't see what I do not want to see,
You don't hear what I don't say.
Won't be what I don't want to be,
I continue in my way.

Don't see, see, see where I'm goin',
Don't see, see, see where I'm goin',

Jethro Tull,"Let me bring you songs from the wood:
To make you feel much better than you could know.
Dust you down from tip to toe.
Show you how the garden grows.

Hold you steady as you go.
Join the chorus if you can:
It'll make of you an honest man.
Let me bring you love from the field:

Poppies red and roses filled with summer rain.
To heal the wound and still the pain,
That threatens again and again,
As you drag down every lover's lane.

Life's long celebration's here.
I'll toast you all in penny cheer.
Let me bring you all things refined:
Galliards and lute songs served in chilling ale.

Greetings well met fellow, hail!
I am the wind to fill your sail.
I am the cross to take your nail:
A singer of these ageless times,

With kitchen prose and gutter rhymes.
Songs from the wood make you feel much better.",Songs from the Wood
Jethro Tull,"Hello you straight-laced lady,
Dressed in white but your shoes aren't clean.
Painted them up with polish
In the hope we can't see where you've been.
The smiling face that you've worn
To greet me rising at morning --
Sent me out to work for my score.
Please me and say what it's for.
Give me the straight-laced promise
And not the pathetic lie.

Tie me down with your ribbons
And sulk when I ask you why.
Your Sunday paper voice cries
Demanding truths I deny.
The bitter-sweet kiss you pretended
Is offered, our affair mended.
Sossity: You're a woman.
Society: You're a woman.

All of the tears you're wasting
Are for yourself and not for me.
It's sad to know you're aging
Sadder still to admit I'm free.
Your immature physical toy has grown,
Too young to enjoy at last your straight-laced agreement:
Woman, you were too old for me.
Sossity: You're a woman.
Society: You're a woman.","Sossity, You're a Woman"

Staked a claim in your heartlands, put grain in your store.

Jethro Tull,"Well the dawn was coming,
Heard him ringing on my bell.
He said, ""My name's the teacher,
That is what I call myself.
And I have a lesson
That I must impart to you.
It's an old expression
But I must insist it's true.

Jump up, look around,
Find yourself some fun,
No sense in sitting there hating everyone.
No man's an island and his castle isn't home,
The nest is for nothing when the bird has flown.""

So I took a journey,
Threw my world into the sea.
With me went the teacher
Who found fun instead of me.

Hey man, what's the plan, what was that you said?
Sun-tanned, drink in hand, lying there in bed.
I try to socialize but I can't seem to find
What I was looking for, got something on my mind.

Then the teacher told me
It had been a lot of fun.
Thanked me for his ticket
And all that I had done.

Try to find new words to say,

Nights of winter turn me cold

We ran the race and the race was won
By running slowly.

Could be soon we'll cease to sound,
Slowly upstairs, faster down.
Then to revisit stony grounds,
We used to know.

Remembering mornings, shillings spent,
Made no sense to leave the bed.
The bad old days they came and went
Giving way to fruitful years.

Saving up the birds in hand
While in the bush the others land.
Take what we can before the man
Says it's time to go.

Each to his own way I'll go mine.
Best of luck in what you find.

Jethro Tull,"This is the story of the hare who lost his spectacles.

Owl loved to rest quietly whilst no one was watching. 
Sitting on a fence one day,
He was surprised  when suddenly a kangaroo ran close by. 
Now this may not seem strange, but when Owl overheard Kangaroo whisper  to no one in
Particular, 
""The hare has lost his spectacles,"" well, he began to wonder.
Presently, the moon appeared from behind a cloud and there, lying on the grass was hare. 
In the stream that flowed by the grass a newt. 
And sitting astride a twig of a bush a bee. Ostensibly motionless, the hare was trembling with
Excitement, for without his spectacles he was completely helpless. 
Where were his spectacles? 
Could someone have stolen them? 
Had he mislaid them? 
What was he to do? 
Bee wanted to help, and thinking he had the answer began:
""You probably ate them thinking they were a carrot.""  
""No!"" interrupted Owl, who was wise. 
""I have good eye-sight, insight, and foresight. How could an intelligent hare make such a silly mistake?"" 
But all this time, Owl had been sitting on the fence, scowling! 
Kangaroo were hopping mad at this sort of talk.
She thought herself far superior in intelligence to the others. 
She was their leader, their guru. 
She had the answer: ""Hare, you must go in search of the optician.""
But then she realized that Hare was completely helpless without his spectacles.
And so, Kangaroo loudly proclaimed, ""I can't send Hare in search of anything!""
""You can guru, you can!"" shouted Newt. 
""You can send him with Owl."" 
But Owl had gone to sleep.  
Newt knew too much to be stopped by so small a problem
""You can take him in your pouch.""
But alas, Hare was much too big to fit into
Kangaroo's pouch. 
All this time, it had been quite plain to hare that the others knew nothing about spectacles.

As for all their tempting ideas, well Hare didn't care. 
The lost spectacles were his own affair. 
And after all, Hare did have a spare a-pair. A-pair.",Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles [Video Track][Multimedia Trac

And on the master raced: behind the hunters chased to where the path was barred.
One fine young lady's horse refused the fence to clear.
I unlocked the gate but she did wait until the pack had disappeared.

Crop handle carved in bone; sat high upon a throne of finest English leather.
The queen of all the pack, this joker raised his hat and talked about the weather.
All should be warned about this high born Hunting Girl.
She took this simple man's downfall in hand; I raised the flag that she unfurled.
Boot leather flashing and spurnecks the size of my thumb.
This highborn hunter had tastes as strange as they come.
Unbridled passion: I took the bit in my teeth.
Her standing over me on my knees underneath.

My lady, be discreet. I must get to my feet and go back to the farm.

I think she ran alone.
Later, she had early warning from

She might have been

Earlier, we had had a drink or four
In some Kensington hotel.
Hard -- It was hard to keep my mind

We took a cab --

Later, in the wee small hours
There was heavy traffic on the radio.

She sighs and shifts on the pillow.
And across her face dancing, the first shadows fly

In a sad voice nobody hears.
She waits in her castle of make-believe
For her white knight to appear.

Runs from the train. Hear her typewriter humming,

Or to fish the Spey, spinning the first run of Spring
Or to die for a cause somewhere.

Wore his trouser cuffs too tight.
Unfashionable to the end --- drank his ale too light.
Death's head belt buckle --- yesterday's dreams ---
The transport caf' prophet of doom.
Ringing no change in his double-sewn seams
In his post-war-babe gloom.

Now he's too old to Rock'n'Roll but he's too young to die.

He once owned a Harley Davidson and a Triumph Bonneville.
Counted his friends in burned-out spark plugs
And prays that he always will.
But he's the last of the blue blood greaser boys
All of his mates are doing time:
Married with three kids up by the ring road
Sold their souls straight down the line.
And some of them own little sports cars
And meet at the tennis club do's.
For drinks on a Sunday --- work on Monday.
They've thrown away their blue suede shoes.

Now they're too old to Rock'n'Roll and they're too young to die.

So the old Rocker gets out his bike
To make a ton before he takes his leave.
Up on the A1 by Scotch Corner
Just like it used to be.
And as he flies --- tears in his eyes ---
His wind-whipped words echo the final take
And he hits the trunk road doing around 120
With no room left to brake.

magnified.

On October's day, towards evening
Sweat embossed veins standing proud to the plough
Salt on a deep chest, seasoning

Last of the line at an honest day's toil
Turning the deep sod under
Flint at the fetlock, chasing the bone
Flies at the nostrils plunder

The Suffolk, the Clydesdale, the Percheron vie
With the Shire on his feathers floating
Hauling soft timber into the dusk
To bed on a warm straw coating

Heavy horses, move the land under me
Behind the plough gliding, slipping and sliding free
And now you're down to the few, and there's no work to do
The tractor's on its way

Let me find you a filly for your proud stallion seed
To keep the old line going
And we'll stand you abreast at the back of the woods
Behind the young trees growing

To hide you from eyes that mock at your girth
Your eighteen hands at the shoulder
And one day when the oil barons have all dripped dry
And the nights are seen to draw colder

They'll beg for your strength, your gentle power
Your noble grace and your bearing
And you'll strain once again to the sound of the gulls
In the wake of the deep plough, sharing

Heavy horses, move the land under me
Behind the plough gliding, slipping and sliding free
And now you're down to the few, and there's no work to do

Wore his trouser cuffs too tight
Unfashionable to the end drank his ale too light

Death's head belts buckle, yesterday's dreams
The transport caf' prophet of doom
Ringing no change in his double sewn seams
In his post-war babe gloom

Now he's too old to rock 'n' roll
But he's too young to die
Yes, he's too old to rock 'n' roll
But he's too young to die

He once owned a Harley Davidson
And a triumph Bonneville
Counted his friends in burned out spark plugs
And prays that he always will

But he's the last of the blue blood greasers boys
And all of his mates are doing time
Married with three kids up by the ring road
Sold their souls straight down the line

And some of them own little sports cars
And meet at the tennis club do's
For drinks on a Sunday, work on Monday

Now they're too old to rock 'n' roll
And they're too young to die
And they're too old to rock 'n' roll
And they're too young to die

To make a ton before he takes his leave
Up on the A1 by Scotch Corner
Just like it used to be

And as he flies, tears in his eyes
His wind-whipped words echo the final take
And he hits the trunk road doing around a 120
With no room left to brake

Jack do you never sleep - does the green still run deep in your heart?
Or will these changing times, motorways, power lines, keep us apart?

I will give you good cheer.

Suffers the long day

Spins the room, you struggle on your way,
Well, don't you sigh, don't you cry, 
Lick the dust from your eye.
We'll meet in the sweet light of dawn.

As the Baker Street train spills your pain 
All over your new dress
And the symphony sounds underground 
Puts you under duress,

Well, don't you squeal as the heel 
Grinds you under the weels.

Jethro Tull,"Got a birthday card at Christmas... it made me think of Jesus Christ.
It said, ""I love you"" in small letters. I simply had to read it twice.
Wood smoke curled from blackened chimneys. The smell of frost was in the air.
Pole star hovered in the blackness. I looked again... it wasn't there.

People have showered me with presents. While their minds were fixed on other things.
Sleigh bells, bearded red suit uncles. Pointy trees and angel wings.
I am the shadow in your Christmas. I am the corner of your smile.
Perfunctory in celebration. You offer content but no style.

That little baby Jesus... he got a birthday card or three.
Gold trinkets and cheap frankincense. Some penny baubles for his tree.
Have some time off for good behaviour. Forty days, give or take a few.
Hey there, sweet baby Jesus
Let's share a birthday card with you.",Birthday Card at Christmas
Jethro Tull,"I flew in on the evening plane.
Is it such a good idea that I am here again?
And I could cut my cold breath with a knife.
And taste the winter of another life.

A yellow cab from JFK, the long way round.
I didn't mind: gave me thinking time before I ran aground
On rocky memories and choking tears.
I believe it only rained round here in thirty years.

Now, it's the first snow on Brooklyn and my cold feet are drumming.
You don't see me in the shadows from your cozy window frame.
And last night, who was in your parlour wrapping presents in the late hour
To place upon your pillow as the morning came?

Thin wind stings my face: pull collar up.
I could murder coffee in a grande cup.
No welcome deli; there's no Starbucks here.
A dime for a quick phone call could cost me dear.

And the first snow on Brooklyn paints a Christmas card upon the pavement.
The cab leaves a disappearing trace and then it's gone.
And the snow covers my footprints, deep regrets and heavy heartbeats.
When you wake you'll never see the spot that I was standing on.

Some things are best forgotten: some are better half-remembered.
I just thought that I might be there on your, on your Christmas night.
And the first snow on Brooklyn makes a lonely road to travel â??
Cold crunch steps that echo as the blizzard bites.

Your suntan does rapidly peel and
Your wise men don't know how it feels to be thick as a brick.

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

Jetty Rae,"Used to be one of them
Prayer in heart and bible in hand
Standing in the crowd screaming aloud
He touched my hand don’t you understand

I used to believe a lot of things
Thought that if you did those things
That you were far away from any angel’s wings
And closer to hell then I’ll ever tell

But I am not better
I’m just a beggar like you
And I’m no healer
I’m no savior, just looking for the truth

Love is not something you understand
But I’m learning to love the holes in your hands
The holes in your clothes, the hurt nobody knows
I’m learning to love you all over again

I love you but I sure I hate the bottle
I love you but I could do without the E
It’s not easy for you I can see
It’s not so easy for you I can see

But I’m not better
I’m just beggar like you
And I’m no healer
I’m no savior, just looking for the truth

He knew what He was talking about 
When He said I do all the things that I wish not
I’d feed you but I’m so hungry you see
I’d clothe you but we’re all swimming in the same naked sea
I’d lead you, but I just want to be led
And I’d love you, and that’s enough said",Beggar
Jetty Rae,"Sterile, empty, nothing
Faces, freezing, rush toward me
Bananas and monkeys, pull hair strands and heart strings
A silent song, a foreign song I have to sing

'Cause I will never be the same
But I did not want to change
And I will never be the same
Now that I’ve seen your pain

Forsaken, lonely, nobody
Your hands reaching for me
Praise songs and dessert cement a bond I’ll never forget
I don’t know why your mother left you, but I hope she regrets

'Cause I will never be the same
But I did not want to change
And I will never be the same
Now that I’ve seen your pain

200 million, lot’s of you

I had love but I know that I wasn't more special then you

'Cause I will never be the same
But I did not want to change
And I will never be the same
Now that I’ve seen your pain

I can see the little faces with smiles
If you’ve got love then your embracing this child
The very ones that the racist profile
Could teach us all  about some patience through trials
These type of babies come in thousands of styles
Check your neighborhood or travel thousands of miles
From the back blocks to alleys
Reach em young before they reach the crack rock in Cali
The side effects of being sexually abused
 Will leave your heart numb and mentally confused
So let’s turn these penitentiary blues into heavenly news
Rise up little baby, rise up, rise up little baby, rise up
I’ll take you by my right hand, with my mic in the left
One on my back, we’ll face the mountain top and ride to the death
Surely to collide with opposition as daddy provides us with the nutrition
To hop clouds and walk on water, chasing rainbows
Til every broken memory and pain goes
Marked with halo’s perfectly fitted spiritual kangos
We share the same foes being from the same family tree
I’ve summoned the first world to come and take a stand with me
Rise up little baby rise up, put your eyes up, rise up

'Cause I will never be the same
But I did not want to change
And I will never be the same
Now that I’ve seen your pain",Blessed Child

For the day I say I do to you
I am waiting to be caught up in you

I am waiting for a fairytale and I might as well kiss it goodbye

That I’d have to cry

I hope this time I get it right, I hope this time it’s worth the fight
I hope this time I get it right, I hope this time it’s worth the fight

I am living for today
Vanishing in moments words that you say
I am longing for your embrace so sorry for the other mistakes
I am loving oh sweetly now, so sweetly now as I lay me down
You are fading you’re anticipating so tired of waiting
Well here I am

I hope this time I get it right, I hope this time it’s worth the fight
I hope this time I get it right, I hope this time it’s worth the fight

We’ve been friendly for quite awhile
Know every inch of your face, your precious smile
I thank heaven as I look above for such a glorious thing as being in love
Some may wonder and I do too if you can see my heart when I look at you

She sowed a vest while I tried to save her
She washed her clothes in the ocean
While I had, a different kind of notion

She brought her guitar but no one really cares
Slim Jim thought he could win so he started a fight
Slim Jim went home with a black eye that night

Jetty Rae,"Are you in this hole that I’m climbing out of?
Been here for weeks was I even thought of?
Sat here for days thinking how the world had wronged me
Well if I blamed your face it was the devil who told me

Are you in the clouds where my head has been lately?
If I take a leap will you reach out and save me?
If I take too long, will you give up on me?
If I lose myself will you come and find me?

'Cause I’ve been dancing without you too long
And I’ve been dreaming nothing much since you’ve been gone
I’ve been waiting for you here in this hole
If it was your hand that saved me I didn’t know

Are you in this heart that feels so empty?
If you are would you come and show me?
Are you in this place that’s so quick to forget you?
If we saw your face we wouldn’t even know you
Are you in my cries for mercy and love?
I’ve got what I need but it’s just never enough
Are you at home sitting all by yourself?
Your best love letter sitting on the shelf

I was dead wrong thinking I was head strong
Lyrically complacent in a spiritual basement to say the least
Influential with the potential to stay fresh as a crease
I put the rest in the peace, he put the death to the beast
So I could rise on up out of Saigon, becoming trial strong
Although this last miles long, I choose to smile on
And carry these torches back into my fortress
To expose these holes that feel like blows to the nose
My present condition of brokenness keeps me searching for hope in this
Is it hopelessness? Sometimes it feels like I’m fighting me
Soul searching for light in me, All I gots a mic and me 
Not really trying to justify these actions
Just trying to rekindle the passion that set my heart apart
So help me find that spark that set my heart apart",Holes

Blue sky a blanket of blue sky
Out my paint chipped window

Lilacs and daffodils smell so good that I could cry
And all the cherry blossoms bloom for miles and miles

It's springtime, springtime, springtime in Michigan

Beaches great lake beaches
My joyful feet in your sand

Sunshine I sail with sunshine
And a touch of wind

Marshmallows sticky marshmallows
I roast in the flame

Shooting stars I watch shooting stars
From the quilt where I lay

It's summer time, summer time, summer time in Michigan

Apples, juicy red apples
In bushels everywhere

Pencils a bouquet of pencils
Patiently wait on my desk

Trees shed their leaves like feathers from a dove
Piled up like pillows for everyone to jump

It's fall time, fall time, fall time in Michigan

Hill tops we sled down hill tops
As fast as we can go

Snow man we built a snow man
When came the first snow

Hot chocolate we sip, hot chocolate let it warm our soul
All the lakes are frozen over so ice fishing we go

It's winter time, winter time, winter time in Michigan",Michigan
Jetty Rae,"Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee

Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff
And brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff. Oh

Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee

Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail
Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail
Noble kings and princes would bow whenever they came
Pirate ships would lower their flags when Puff roared out his name. Oh

Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee

A dragon lives forever but not so little boys
Painted wings and giant rings make way for other toys
One grey night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more
And Puff that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar

His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rai
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane
Without his life-long friend, Puff could not be brave
So Puff that mighty dragon sadly slipped into his cave. Oh

Jetty Rae,"I woke up to a gray, gray sky
And I wished I could turn gray to blue
Pitter patter exclaimed the raindrops
As I pulled on my yellow rain boots

Grabbed my umbrella
And went on my way
Singing rain, rain, rain, oh go away

La, la, la, la, la, la

Skip, skip, skip, oh skip to my Lou
I danced through the puddles like a caribou
Use my umbrella as if it were a cane
I'm the king of the world; I'm the queen of the rain

All the grass is greener and the gardens grow
The lakes do rise, and the rivers flow

La, la, la, la, la, la ,la ,la ,la

Patty, patty cake, oh bakers man
Won't you send away this rain as fast as you can?
Angry dark clouds won't you blow away
And come back again another day

Or I'm bound to sing my rainy, rainy day song
Singing rain, rain go away all day long

La, la, la, la, la, la

Stuck my hand out held the last raindrop
This rain parade had decided to stop
Thanks for all the green and thanks for the wet

Jetty Rae,"I saw the sun rise in your eyes
Than it went behind a cloud
Hail and snow of disbelief came raining down
I saw the sun set in your eyes
Filled me with wonder and surprise
Never knew I loved a chocolate sunrise til I saw your eyes

I saw the glory of the risen Lord
Faithfully across the shore
I've been in this boat before
So far, so far away from shore

I saw a million reasons to love
But only could stand on one
Because you loved me
Because you loved me first

But if I'm gonna stand in the pouring rain
I'm gonna make sure that your there holding my hand
And If I'm gonna stand in the darkest valley
I'm gonna need you to shine your light for me
And if I'm gonna fall into a hole
I'll give you the rope so you can pull
And If I'm gonna jump to a land of new heights
I'm gonna bring you up to see all the sights
And If I'm gonna play a game of hide and seek
You be the hide and I'll be the seek
And If I'm gonna give my bread to the hungry
I'm gonna need you to give your bread with me

I saw a darkness I never want to face
It's covered with light when I kiss your face
I saw a light consuming me, reflections of love
Cut soul deep
I saw a yellow butterfly
This time I won't mistake the signs
I saw a vision of you and me
Holding tightly the way it should be

But if I'm gonna grow old and wrinkly
I'm gonna want you there turning grey with me
And if I'm gonna leave a legacy
I'm gonna want your name written next to mine in history
If I'm gonna go out with a bang
You be the trigger and I'll the be bang
And if I'm gonna have to die eventually
I'm gonna want you there waiting for me
And if I've got a song in heaven to sing
I'm gonna need some one to harmonize with my melody

You love me when I'm angry, you love me when I am mad

You are the kindest soul that I have ever known
Oh baby in your arms, that's where I am home

If you can stand all my pretending
If you can stand all my spending
If you can stand all my drama
Then I guess I can stand your mama

You are the most handsome man that I have ever seen
I could travel back a thousand years, search through all of history

You are the smartest man that I have ever met
All our babies will be smart as you, Oh I'm all set

You are the bravest soul that I have ever known
After all you're marrying me, it's not to late to say no

I can stand all your technology
Just know that it's not in my biology
I can stand the way you eat cereal

A traveler’s soul wanting to come in from the cold
It's so cold

We run this map like a band of thieves
We take all we want, never what we need
What do we need?

Ashes ashes we all fall down
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
Dust to dust, blow on these dry bones
Pick me up, carry me home

You have searched every broken road
Longing to restore the travelers soul to your
Make me whole

I’m a sunless sky got no alibi for what’s become of me
I’m a heat-less flame everyday is the same, don’t expect nothing from me
I’m a loaded gun but I’m stuck in the mud of this troubled philosophy

I handed you my freedom just like that
you pushed me to my grave with a pat on the back

Give me my freedom back
Cuz I won’t be caught standing still, wasting time
Waiting until you, give me my freedom back
Cuz the sun won’t shine if these words of mine, get laid to rest in me

I was a silent voice, but it was my choice to deceive myself to be
I was a clueless victim whose only conviction was living in apathy
I was a mold fitting, whose stories unwritten I’m stopping this mockery
I was another sob story ‘til I saw the glory of what it means to be free

I handed you my freedom just like that
You pushed me to my grave with a pat on the back

I’m walking in freedom now
You held my hand like a ball in chain
You stole my heart like a thief with no shame
I’m walking in freedom now

Jetty Rae,"What if I told you my heart was black, blacker than black
Showed you all my dirty laundry in a neat and filthy stack
Would you wash my clothes in your river divine
Then set my shame free and hang them out to dry on salvation's line
Would you, would you?

I’ve been called a lot of things, but never have I been pure
Love has always come with dirty deeds, and my heart has always longed for more
I’m pulling back these darkened shades, treading these bleak streets no more

Cuz when the sun shines on me, for the first time
I feel alive, ohhhh

Said I never felt like this before
But now I feel it, I’m so sure
I’m in love, I’m in love, I’m in love
I’m in love, love with you

What you have done for me I will try to repay
There is no payment for freedom in full and bleeding out this soul of pain
What kind of lover covers me up, when I am laying in shame?
Oh I’ve got myself, I’ve only ever had myself to blame, oh I blame

Cuz when the sun shines on me, for the first time
I feel alive, ohhhh

Jetty Rae,"More than anything I wish I could produce a smile
That is genuine, I've gotta stay genuine
More than life itself, I wish that life itself
Would pick me up by the belt
And sing me a happy song
'Cause it seems like those never last very long
And I get tired of people asking me what's wrong
More than anything I wish that I could make a cheerful toast
And mean it, and mean it
Wish that I could sing someone to sleep with lullabies
But I would only be singing them lies

So tell me, why is life so pleasant in the movies?
The girl gets the guy, the guy learns how to fly
And they fly off to the moon
Well I'm just wondering if that ships sailing soon
'Cause I've never, no I've never been to the moon

More than anything I wish I could speak my mind
And have it be nice, no but I won't be nice
More than a pack of new strings, I wish the songs that I would sing
Wouldn't reek of the blues and the minors
All the melancholy confiners
More than most I wish that most could see
That nothing comes from romantic fantasy
And I don't want hypocrisy I just want someone to want me for me
So I'll wait another day
In this state
Could slate the whole thing against me I'm sure, I'm sure
And I'll laugh and I'll cry on those lonely nights

Windows without any screens

As nice as you’d like to believe

Behind this green screen
And pretend that I do not see

I know that sounds so silly
So crazy, so crazy of me
But my imagination can’t help
But make you a little more scary 
Than you ought to be, than you ought to be to me

I’m knitting my fibers to your being
We are one in the same, you’re all I’ve ever needed

I’m a wretch, without your love
I am needy
And I was naked, until you wrapped me
In your banner of love

We’re sailing the seven seas together
Come hell or high water if we live or if we perish
It’s forever

We’ll climb our highest mountain and stand in wonder
Our love will manifest in a powerful symphony of thunder

I’ve locked me up a stubborn jailer in a cell
But I’m brave enough to never ever, call for help
When stones are thrown I want to throw them back
I never want to be the bigger man, I never pass the test

But I try, I try

I wound myself with your imaginary words
Convince my ears and heart they’re sure of what
They’ve never even heard
Maintaining space and my sense of dignity have kept me
Far away from the arms of real transparency

Forgive me, forgive

You are like a snowflake that fell to the ground
Here for a moment but life melted you down
Melted you down, melted you down
And I am just a poor man holding out my hands
Counting the sheep until I sleep and see you again
See you again, see you again, see you again

Hold on darling one more day you’ll wake up, wake up, wake up

Where the light lends itself to soft repose

You could hurt me using the sharp end of what you say

Break me, take me
Just let me feel your love again

Things just haven't been the same 'round here
And people talk
And people stare
Oh, Adrian, come out and play

An unfortunate accident in a canoe
Doctor said, ""I'm sorry, not much I can do""
And the air was so still
And his eyes, they did not blink
Oh, Adrian, come out and play

Little Mary Epperson liked him
She vowed always to watch after him
But still he did not move
And the doctor said it's no use
Oh, Adrian, come out and play

She sat by his side, and watched the years fly by
He looked so fragile, he looked so small
And she wondered why he was still alive at all

Everyone in town had that ""I'm so sorry"" look
They talked in a whispered hush, said
""I'd turn the machines off""
But still she sat by his side
She said, ""Life, he won't be denied""
Oh Adrian, come out and play

Yellow flowers decorate his bedroom
Sign above his door says ""Welcome Home""
But he just sits and stares
He's awake but still not there
Oh, Adrian, come out and play

She sat by his side, and watched the years fly by
He looked so fragile, he looked so small
And she wondered why he was still alive at all

And little Mary Epperson grew up lovely
And she still comes to visit him on Sundays
He's like an unused toy
He's got big hands but the mind of a little boy

And burns dry thoughts like leaves

And the rest must wait to be saved

Always felt I was outside, looking in on you.
You're always the mysterious one with
Dark eyes and careless hair,

But too cool to care.
You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather

Well in case you failed to notice,
In case you failed to see,
This is my heart bleeding before you,
This is me down on my knees

And these foolish games are tearing me apart,
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

You're always brilliant in the morning,
Smoking your cigarettes and talking over coffee
Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar

You'd teach me of honest things,
Things that were daring, things that were clean
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean
I hid my soiled hands behind my back
Somewhere along the line, I must have gone off track with you

Excuse me, guess I've mistaken you for somebody else,
Somebody who gave a damn,
Somebody more like myself

And these foolish games are tearing me,
Your tearing me, your tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart

Just to disprove all the things that you say
It doesn't take a talent to be mean
Your words can crush things that are unseen

So please be careful with me, I'm sensitive
And I'd like to stay that way

You always tell me that it's impossible
To be respected, and be a girl
Why's it gotta be so complicated
Why you gotta tell me if I'm hated

Oh please be careful with me, I'm sensitive
And I'd like to stay that way

When I was thinking, that it might do some good
If we robbed the cynics and took all their food
That way what they believe will have taken place
And we can give it to everybody who have some faith

So please be careful with me, I'm sensitive
And I'd like to stay that way

I have this theory, that if we're told we're bad
Then that's the only idea we'll ever have
But maybe if we are surrounded in beauty
Someday we will become what we see
'Cause anyone can start a conflict
It's harder yet to disregard it
I'd rather see the world from another angle
We are everyday angels

Knock knock knockin' on his door

'Cause so many times you've come to me cry crying
Trying to stop, you said it hurts so bad
But please don't let you
Go back for more

My little sister is a zombie in a body
With no soul, a role she has learned to play
In a world today where nothing else matters
But it matters, we gotta start feeding our souls
Not our addictions or afflictions of pain
To avoid the same questions we must
Ask ourselves to get any answers
We gotta start feeding our souls
Have been lost to the millions with lots
Who feed on addiction selling pills and what's hot
And I wish I could save her from all their delusions
All the confusion hey hey

Of a nation that starve us for salvation
But clothing is the closest approximation
To God and He only knows that drugs
Are all we know of love

Every day we starve while we eat white bread
And beer instead of a handshake or hug
We spill the pills and sweep them
Under the rug, hey

My little sister is a Zombie in a body
With no soul, a role she has learned to play

It's you that I adore,
I'm gonna give you some more

We'll sit on the front porch, the sun can warm my feet
You can drink your coffee with sugar and cream
I'll drink my decaf herbal tea
Pretend we're perfect strangers and that we never met,
My, you remind me of a man I used to sleep with
That's a face I'd never forget
And you can be Henry Miller and I'll be Anais Nin
Except this time it'll be even better,
We'll stay together in the end
Come on darlin', let's go back to bed

Jewel,"Please don't say I love you,
Those words touch me much too deeply.
They make my core tremble.
Don't think you realize the effect you have over me.
And please don't look at me like that,
It just makes me want to make you near me always.
And please don't kiss me so sweet.
It makes me crave a thousand kisses to follow.
And please touch me like that.
Makes every other embrace seem pale and' shallow.
And please don't come so close.
It just makes me want to make you near me always.

Please don't bring me flowers,
They only whisper the sweet things you say.
And don't try to understand me,
Your hands already know too much anyways.
Makes me want to make you near me always.

And when you look in my eyes,
Please know my heart is in your hands.
It's nothing that I understand,
But in your arms you have complete power over me.
So be gently if you please.
'Cause your hands are in my hair,
But my heart is in your teeth babe,
And it makes me want to make you near me always,
Your hands are in my hair,
But my heart is in your teeth babe,
And it makes me want to make you near me always,
Want to be near you always.
Want to be near you always.

Jewel,"Eighty years, an old lady now, sitting on the front porch
Watching the clouds roll by
They remind her of her lover, how he left her, and of times long ago,
When she used color carelessly, painted his portrait
A thousand times, or maybe just his smile,
Her and her canvas would follow him wherever he would go

'Cause they were painters and they were painting themselves
A lovely world

Oil streaked daisies covered the living room walls
He put water colored roses in her hair
He said, ""Love, I love you,
I want to give you the mountains, the sunshine,
The sunset too
I want to give you a world as beautiful as you are to me""

'Cause I'm a painter and I want to paint you
A lovely way

So they sat down and made a drawing of their love,
They made it an art to live by
They painted every passion, every home, created every beautiful child
In the winter they were weavers of warmth,
In the summer they were carpenters of love
They thought blue prints were too sad so they made them yellow

And they were painters and they had painted themselves
A lovely world

Until one day the rain fell as thick as black oil
And in her heart she knew something was wrong
She went running through the orchard screaming,
""No God, don't take him from me!""
But by the time she got there, she feared he already had gone
She got to where he lay, water colored roses in his hands for her
She threw them down screaming, ""Damn you man, don't leave me
With nothing left behind but these cold paintings, these cold portraits
To remind me!""

He said, ""Love I only leave a little, try to understand
I put my soul in this life we've created with these four hands
Love, I leave, but only a little, this world holds me still
My body may die now, but these paintings are real""
La li lai la li lai la li lai

So many seasons came and many seasons went
And many times she saw her love's face watering the flowers,
Talking to the trees and singing to his children,
And when the wind blew, she knew he was listening,
And how he seemed to laugh along, and how he seemed to hold her
When she was crying

'Cause they were painters and they had painted themselves
A lovely world

Eighty years, an old lady now, sitting on the front porch
Watching the clouds roll by
They remind her of her lover, how he left her, and of times long ago,
When she used color carelessly, painted his portrait
A thousand times, or maybe just his smile,
Her and her canvas would follow him wherever he would go
Yes, she and her canvas still follow

Say it's been swell, sweetheart, but it was just one of those things
Those flings, those strings you've got to cut

Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't want to talk
So I picked up a paper, it was more bad news

Same old story, not much to say
Hearts are broken every day

I brush my teeth and put the cap back on
I know you hate it, when I leave the light on
I pick up a book, and turn the sheets down
And take a deep breath and a good look around

Said, ""angel, I'm tired and I'm lonely
And i need somebody by my side""

It's a long road that stretched from Vegas to nowhere
But it'd been an even longer time
Since he found some piece of mind
And he lived off of bubblegum and cigarettes
And got his nourishment from all-night stores
Thought he'd just keep driving
Til he out drove his sorrow

He said, ""angel, oh do you want a ride?""
Said ""angel, I'm tired and I'm lonely
And i need somebody by my side""

Her feet were warm and tired
But as determined as a soul
She left with no regrets
But also no possessions did she own
Her heart was as fragile as her thin, loving arms
She's praying to god to take away her lonely
When he pulled on aside of the road

And he said, ""angel, oh do you want a ride?""
Said, ""angel, I'm tired and I'm lonely
And i need somebody by my side""

The highway goes on forever
I've seen a thousand men like him before
And I've seen a thousand angels that
Got into the car
They're just a couple of lost souls
Looking to rekindle some sort of forgotten dream
I hope they find what they're looking for
In the solace of the road

They said, ""angel, do you want a ride?""
Said, ""angel, I'm tired and I'm lonely

Where the winds all blew
The churches don't have windows
But the graveyards do
Me and my shadow
Are wrestling again
Look out stranger
There's a dark cloud moving in

But if you could hear
The voice in my heart
It would tell you
I'm afraid I am alone

Wont somebody please
Hold me, release me
Show me the meaning of mercy
Let me loose
Fly, let me fly
Let me fly

I'm blending, I'm blurring
I'm bleeding
Into the scenery

Is so much easier
But I hold myself hostage
In the mirror

The voice in my heart
It would tell you
Im tired of feeling this way

God, wont you please
Hold me, release me
Show me the meaning of mercy
Let me loose
Let me fly
Let me fly
Let me fly

I wont be held back

Oh, oh be still my little heart
Oh, oh love is a flame neither timid nor tame
Take these stars from my crown
Let the years fall down
Lay me out in firelight
Let my skin feel the night
Fasten me to your side
And say it will be soon

Could swallow the moon

Let's all fall away
That's not crucial now
I want a brave love, one that makes me weak in the knees
I want a crazy, crazy love
One that makes me come undone at the seams

Cause I'm tired of all these pilgrims, these puritans, these thieves 
Of all these unbelievers who whittle love down at the knees 
Let these swift roads destroy themselves 
Let the world fall into it's sleep 
For we shall be spared 
We shall be left standing 
To face what's left of concrete and honey

Let's run with the hunted, the untamed
Kiss the flame
Embrace the faceless, the unnamed

There are nightmares on these sidewalks
There are jokes on TV
There are people selling thoughtlessness
With such casualty
But wherefore art thou Romeo
Where have all the brave men gone
Show me one man who knows his own heart
To him I shall belong

Your hands are icy cold
Your eyes burn bright against the frost-bit sky
You never seemed more lovely than you do tonight

Pale on the horizon
Like leaves frozen in the snow

Will time stand still if it's pierced with cold

The more I know

It haunts me when you're gone
Mend me to your side and never let go
Say time knows nothing, we'll never grow cold

Jewel,"Inside my skin there is this space
It twists and turns
It bleeds and aches
Inside my heart there's an empty room
It's waiting for lightning
It's waiting for you
And I am wanting
And I am needing you here
Inside the absence of fear

Muscle and sinew
Velvet and stone
This vessel is haunted
It creaks and moans
My bones call to you
In their separate skin
I make myself translucent
To let you in, for
I am wanting
And I am needing of you here
Inside the absence of fear

There is this hunger
This restlessness inside of me
And it knows that you're no stranger
You're my gravity

My hands will adore you through all darkness aim
They will lay you out in moonlight
And reinvent your name
For I am wanting you
And I am needing you here
I need you near
Inside the absence of fear",Absence of Fear
Jewel,"There's a little bird, 
Somebody sent
Down to the earth to
Live on the wind.
Blowing on the wind, 
She sleeps on the wind,
This little bird,
Little bird.

Light and fragile
And feathered sky-blue.
Thin and graceful,
The sun shining through.
She flies so high,
Up in the sky, 
Way out of reach
Of human eyes.

Light and fragile,
And feathered sky-blue.
Thin and graceful,
The sun shining through.
She flies so high,
Up in the sky,
Way out of reach
Of human eyes. 

Light and fragile,
She's feathered sky-blue.
Thin and graceful,
The sun shining through.

She touches ground

Jewel,"People living their lives for you on TV 
They say they're better than you and you agree 
Another burger, another hot dog, some fries 
A wish in the well, hope your health don't go to hell, well 
Another doctors bill, another lawyer's bill 
Another cute cheap thrill 
You know you love him if you put him in your will 

[Chorus]
Who will save your soul when it comes to the flower 
Who will save your soul after all the lies that you told, boy 
Who will save your soul if you won't save your own? 

We try to hustle them, try to bustle them, try to cuss them 
The cops want someone to bust down on Orleans Avenue 
Another day, another dollar, another war, another tower 
Went up where the homeless had their homes 
So we pray to as many different gods as there are flowers 
We call religion our friend 
We're so worried about saving our souls 
Afraid that God will take his toll 
That we forget to begin 

[Chorus]

Some are walking, some are talking, some are stalking their kill 
You got social security, but that don't pay your bills 
There are addictions to feed and there are mouths to pay 
So you bargain with the Devil, say you're okay for today 
You say you love them take your money and run 
Say it's been swell, sweetheart, but it was just one of those things 
Those flings, those strings you've got to cut 
So get out on the streets, girls, and bust your butts

Jewel,"Fat boy goes to the pool
Sees his reflection, doesn't know what to do
He feels little inside and filled with pride

Oh, fragile flame
No one sees the same

Trying to think of funny things to say

Like, ""this is just a game I play.""
And, ""I like me this way.""
Oh, fragile flame
When no one feels the same

Hush, sleep, don't think, just eat
Your daddy's little boy
Your mama's pride and joy
You know they love ya
But not because they hold ya

If I could melt myself like ice
Or outrun my skin and just be pure wind.""

Sometimes I feel the same",Fat Boy [Live]
Jewel,"I was thinking that I might fly today
Just to disprove all the things that you say
It doesn't take a talent to be mean
You words can crush things that are unseen

[Chorus]
So please be careful with me, I'm sensitive
And I'd like to stay that way

You always tell me that it's impossible
To be respected, and be a girl
Why's it gotta be so complicated
Why you gotta tell me if I'm hated

[Chorus]

When I was thinking, that it might do some good
If we robbed the cynics and took all their food
That way what they believe will have taken place
And we can give it people who have some faith

[Chorus]

I have this theory, that if we're told we're bad
Then that's the only idea we'll ever have
But maybe if we are surrounded in beauty
Someday we will become what we see
Cause anyone can start a conflict
It's harder yet to disregard it
I'd rather see the world from another angle
We are everyday angels
Be careful with me 'cause I'd like to stay that way",I'm Sensitive [Live]

In silence I feared my heart
Would remain words unheard

It would be that we're all ok
And not to worry because worry is wasteful
And useless in times like these
I will not be made useless
I won't be idled with despair
I will gather myself around my faith
For light does the darkness most fear

My hands are small, I know,
But they're not yours they are my own
But they're not yours they are my own
And I am never broken

Poverty stole your golden shoes
But it didn't steal your laughter
And heartache came to visit me
But i knew it wasn't ever after

We will fight, not out of spite
For someone must stand up for what's right
Cause where there's a man who has no voice
There ours shall go singing

In the end only kindness matters
In the end only kindness matters

I will get down on my knees and I will pray
I will get down on my knees and I will pray
I will get down on my knees and I will pray

My hands are small, I know,
But they're not yours they are my own
But they're not yours they are my own
And I am never broken

My hands are small, i know,
But they're not yours they are my own
But they're not yours they are my own

For poor on'ry people like you and like I;
I wonder as I wander out under the sky

When Mary birthed Jesus 'twas in a cow's stall
With wise men and farmers and shepherds and all
But high from God's heaven, a star's light did fall
And the promise of ages it then did recall.

A star in the sky or a bird on the wing
Or all of God's Angels in heaven to sing
He surely could have it, 'cause he was the King",I Wonder as I Wander

She said ""Now baby, you don't look that bad"" 

[Chorus]
Cause everybody needs someone sometime 
Everybody needs someone, can't you see? 
Everybody needs someone sometime 

Spivy Leaks was a drip of a man 
He looked like a potato shoved into jeans 
He recollects it wasn't that long ago 
That he could walk by 
Make the young girls scream 
But he thought he'd just let it all slide 
Let it all pass 
Cause he thought love was best on the run 
He said ""Now baby, it don't seem that fun"" 

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Hey there honeybee 
Will you give me, sugar? 
And if you shake real cute 
I might give you some sugar 
I was doing alright on my own 
Now I might just take you home sugar 

Sister Mary used to be a nun 
She thought that she'd retire and have her some fun 
Mr. Joe of the Philadelphia Joes 
Well he walked in the post office one night 
He said ""Hey sweetheart, you know you look alright"" 

[Chorus]",Everybody Needs Someone Sometime
Jewel,"Hate you, I love you
Leave, please
Don't go away

I like your face
Or if I wish

You're malicious
You're sweet but
Don't remember my name
And heads you win
And tails I'm lost
And love equals pain

I am drifting
Without an anchor
Through your ambiguous region
A strange continent
Immune to all reason
And I'm flattered by
Your gray matter

Inside my skin
I feel your tongue
Telling me I'm dirty
And licking my bones
A surge against silence
A knife across a plate
Makes the sound
Of need on hate

And I do not understand
Why a woman can't
Just love a man

You're amusing
You're a real cool show
With your meat hooks

You got mothballs in your soul
From too many false teeth
And greasy flash bulbs

Jewel,"A lonely street lamp
I'm out on the street walking home
A small pale blur
Leaving trails like a snail
I move so slow
Time can bruise
Violent indigo 
Rush home to your arms
You soothe my weary soul 

[Chorus]
Wrong or right
Be mine tonight
Harsh world be damned
We'll make a stand
Love can bind
But mine is blind
Others stray but I won't
Walk away
Walk away

The clubs are full
Of couples resisting being one
They wear their youth
Like badges that tarnish all too soon
We'll be a team
Our two will be one
Love will be our fortress
When all else comes undone

Sometimes the world don't make sense
Small children filled with violence
Let our light shine through the night",I Won't Walk Away
Jewel,"They say that Jesus loves you
What about me?
They say that money breaks you
I still wanna see
They say you're only half alive
Till you give extra whitening a try

Well I wanna see, I wanna see 
What can you do for me?

Showing ta-tas on the TV is OK
I wanna be OK,too
Having my picture in a magazine makes me special
How special are you?
They say if I donate, even I
Can buy a lot in heaven before I die

Well I wanna see, I wanna see

Gonna get get someone else to pull the punch

Gonna pay a priest for a,

Jewel,"I saw you standing there
Pride in your pocket
You combed barbed wire
Through your hair
You thought I didn't notice
The skin on
Your teeth had a tear
To make me notice
You started to shout
Then you and all your midgets
Started flapping your
Tiny arms all about
They said
You were a wise man
When did they teach
A wise man to pout?
It's not your little boy hands
It's not your little boy name
It's those big boy hands
That are the ones to blame
I tried to be unlovable
Why couldn't you do the same?
What's the matter?
Does your love need a home?
All right then, love me
Just leave me alone
Your mother was a wolf bite
Your daddy was a cigarette
Your brother was a rose bud
Crossbreed with a car wreck
Your sister was a stockbroker
But you ain't nothing
But a turtleneck
And you were hypnotized
Just standing there
In the middle of the street
You had iron butterflies as kisses
You had gold dust in your teeth
You used one eye as a hostage
The other one to stab your meat
I tried to forget you but
You tied bells to your name
And they'd jingle every time
I thought of you
Without shame
Your arms are like corset strings
I tried to be unlovable
Why couldn't you do the same?
What's the matter
Does your leave need a home?
All right then, love me
Just leave me alone
It's not your little boys hands
It's not your little boys name
It's those big boy hands

Does your love need a home?

Jewel,"You see the ghost of the buffalo moving both fierce and slow
Like glittering prophesies on the edge of the horizon
As you drive glittering highways and beaten-up byways
That straddle and girdle our great and many-faced nation
You see the lambs in the ghettos who worship their Gepettos
Believing in, never seeing, the strings they think bind them
So we write to our congressmen with bleeding pens of the sorrow within
And in return, they just send tickets to the latest Tom Hanks show 

[Chorus]
Welcome to the new wild west
Each man for himself
A nation of civilized steeples
And lonely people
Welcome to the new wild west

There are so many factions and cue-card reactions
It's hard to keep clear the possibilities here 'cause there's no force to unite them
Privilege has ruled for thousands of years
Wars have been fought with bibles and tears
Yet liberation can't deny the temptation and soon becomes the oppressor
Show me a leader who's fit to lead
Who don't sow his seed in anything wounded enough to breed
Because after all, what fun is power if you can't act like a rock star?

[Chorus]

As for me, I've been petty
Oh, and unkind, but I know my own mind
And since it seems clear there's no one leading us here
The only thing left it appears is to task ourselves to be better each time, than those before us
We'll be an army of thieves, of self-freed slaves, of mild-mannered maids
We'll fight with whispers and blades
So get ready, a new day is dawning",The New Wild West

Try to keep it clear, but I'm losing it here
To the twilight

There's a burning bush to my right
You aren't in sight
You aren't in sight

Do you want me
Like I want you
Or am I standing still
Beneath a darkened sky
Or am I standing still
With the scenery flying by
Or am I standing still
Out of the corner of my eye
Was that you passing me by

Mothers on the stoop
Boys in souped-up coupes
On this hot summer night
Between fight and flight
Is the blind man's sight
And a choice that's right
I roll the window down
Feel like I'm gonna drown in this strange town
Feel broken down
Feel broken down

Do you need me
Like I need you
Or am I standing still
Beneath a darkened sky
Or am I standing still

I'm headed out
With all my friends

About the way
I've been spending my time
Trying my guts out
For every dime
Working in an
Office building tall
You don't know
Who's next to you at all
But being out here
The blood, the guts, the beer
Is a test
Only time will tell
It brings you close, man
Closer than hell

Can't recall
Where are we been
I guess we'll just go
Go till we're too old

I talked to Lou
He quit back in 92
Says he misses it bad
Those were the best time
He ever had
He said
""Give it hell to the end
'Cause once you quit
You can't get it back again""

And sh*tty food
Washed down
With cancelled flights

It's a long slow slide
It's a long slow slide
Down

Once the neon is gone
There's still that golden splinter at your side
His manners are charming
But who are you fooling
You're still nobody's bride
And Bukowski's widow
Haunts each empty seat on the Ferris wheel
As ghoulish lovers collide in a collage of kisses that they steal

[Chorus]

And outside your window you can see the circus it's lurching
with rings of smoke
You laugh halfheartedly at the punchline
Not realizing they've made you the joke
And inside you're heart a war is raging
A region still untamed
The worst fear I can imagine is for the mystery to be named
Is for the mystery to be named

Look at the sky
From upside down
There's nobody we have 2 be
Let's live fast and see where it leads

In love like wine
Let kisses quench
This thirst of mine
Let me feel the weight of your skin

Jewel,"If you want my heart
you have to promise not to tear it apart
'Cause my heart
Has been hurt a lot
And it always seems
Love is not sweet, like in dreams
Something falls through
But I don't want that to happen to me and you

[Chorus]
So be
Careful, warning
Fragile heart

Last Saturday
We ate dinner at your parents' place
Last Saturday, you said
How you feel will not go away
Well, all the fishes in the sea
Could not be happier than me

[Chorus]

Only fools believe that
Nothing changes, nothing leaves
But I need to believe that we at least
Will have some dignity
'Cause everything changes
Nothing stays the same
But that's no excuse to be casual
Or to place the blame
you have to be careful with me

[Chorus]",Fragile Heart
Jewel,"I will come to you
In the still of the night
And I will crush you
With the burden of sight
And you will understand
The shadows in my heart
The fury of my conviction
Will cause your heart to quicken
And then, my dear
You will see you want me here

[Chorus]
And when you wake up
You will see yourself through my eyes
And when you break up
You'll understand
Why it is I cry

Let me speak quietly
So your heart can hear
I will hypnotize and mesmerize you
With the sound of your own fear

[Chorus]

I just want to get along
This is your song
I wrote it in my head
But the melody's all wrong
And it's driving me crazy
Not having you, baby
To keep me company
In my own private world
You're my one true girl
And I won't be stoppin' Just 'cause your knees are knockin'
When I decide 2 drop in
So don't make a sound
Cause there's no one around
To come between us now
I'm gonna haunt you, girl",Haunted

Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean

I've been together, but felt alone.
I've made love without love being shown.
I've seen sorrow in a pair of dice,
All things that came in two's made me cry
Until tonight.

[Chorus]

Can't stop, won't stop.
Love is all we've got
Know how much I love ya
When I put my arms around you
Can't stop, won't stop
You are all I want

So I drive to you tonight
I was blind, now I have sight.
I could not leave you even if I tried.
You're heart beats inside of me.
Like a star in the dark of night,
Like birds lost in flight.
The clouds in the sky are blue, yea
The clouds in the sky are blue",Drive to You
Jewel,"I said to myself:
Self,
Why are you awake again?
It's one a.m.
Standin' with the fridge wide open, starin'
Such a sight, fluorescent light
The stars are bright
Might make a wish
If I believed in that shit
But as it is I might watch T.V.
Cause it's nice to see
That people can be more messed up more me

I say to myself
As I smile at the wall
Just let myself fall

[Chorus] 
It's gonna be all right
No matter what they say
It's gonna be a good day
Just wait and see
It's gonna be all right
Cause I'm all right with me
It's gonna be, it's gonna be
It's gotta be

I shiver, shut the door
Can't think standin' here no more
I'm alone, my mind's racing heart breaking
Can you be everything I need you to be?
Can you protect me like a daughter?
Love me like a father?
Can you drink me like water?
Say I'm like the desert
Just way hotter

The point of it all
Is that if I should fall
It's still your name I call

[Chorus] 

As long as we

Laugh out loud
Laugh like we are mad
Cause this crazy mixed up beauty is all that we have
Because what's love
But an itch we can't scratch,
A joke we can't scratch?
God, but we still laugh.

Get back in bed
Turn off the T.V.
You say it'll be all right, baby
Just wait and see

[Chorus] 

I'm awake again
It's one a.m.
Staring
Such a sight
Well, at least the stars are bright",Good Day
Jewel,"It's four in the afternoon
I'm on a flight leaving L.A.
Trying to think about my life
My youth scattered along the highway

Hotel rooms and headlines
I've made a living with a song
Just a guitar as my companion
Wanting desperately to belong

Fame is filled with spoiled children
They grow fat on fantasy
I guess that's why I'm leaving
I crave reality

So goodbye Alice in Wonderland
Goodbye yellow brick road
There is a difference between dreaming and pretending
I did not find paradise
It was only a reflection of my lonely mind searching
For what was missing in my life

I'm embarrassed to say the rest is a rock and roll cliche
I hit the bottom when I reached the top
I never knew it was you who was breaking my heart
I thought you had to love me
You did not

Yes a heart can hallucinate
If it's completely starved for love
Can even make monsters seem like
Angels from above

You forged my love like a weapon
And turned it against me like a knife
You broke my last heart-string
But you opened up my eyes

So goodbye Alice in Wonderland
Goodbye yellow brick road
There is a difference between dreaming and pretending
That was not love in your eyes
It was only a reflection of my lonely mind wanting
What was missing in my life

Dreaming is a good thing cause it brings new things to life
Pretending is an ending that perpetuates a lie
Forgetting what you are
Seeing for what you've been told
And growing up is not the absence of dreaming
It's being able to understand the difference between the ones you can hold
And the ones that you've been sold

Well, truth is stranger than fiction
And this is my chance to get it right
Life is much better without all of your pretty lies

So Goodbye Alice in Wonderland
You can keep your yellow brick road
Cause there is a difference between dreaming and pretending
That was not love in your eyes
It was only a reflection of my lonely mind wanting
It was only a reflection of my lonely mind wishing
That you were what was missing from my life",Goodbye Alice in Wonderland
Jewel,"Your lungs fill up with concrete
Her voice is all you can hear
Red lips and a screwdriver
Wrapped around some mink-clad smear
And you know that she's a diamond
In this damn jukebox hell
'Cause fools gold only fools fools
In two-bit hotels.
But she's cooler than all that
She's a real high-class cat
She's queen of the last dance rodeo.

But under the gas lamp
The air is thick and velvety
Your bones filled with hunger
Your heart filled with longing
You're no longer human
You're an insatiable hole.
You wanna bury your face forever
In the navel of her soul
'Cause you know 

All you need is a heart to call home
All you need is a heart to call home
That's all.

Light bulbs, and nylons
And plastic chandeliers
Objects are only objects,
They can't feel when you're near
And tangerine lips
And lily-white breasts
These things are eternal
Inside them humanity rests.
The skin is like a seashell
You listen to the soul
Like an old-time radio show.

But under the gas lamp

'Cause you know

All you need is a heart to call home
That's all.

But don't wander too far
On one constant star
Darkness exists, except where you are
Your feet are filled with wandering
They follow your own
'Cause everywhere you are
Feels like home.
So search all you miners
You hunters of dreams
Look in the alleyways
For what you know is not what it seems
And fame, all you maidens,
It don't exist too long
But at least look behind you
And see your own shadow's gone
Don't you know it's the last rodeo
You gotta find yourself a cowboy
Or someone to keep you
Warm when it snows

But under the gas lamp
The air is thick and velvety
Your bones filled with hunger
Your heart filled with longing
You're no longer human
You're an insatiable hole.
You wanna bury your face forever
In the navel of her soul
'Cause you know

Jewel,"Lights are bright in the circus
The geeks and the freaks all light cigarettes and laugh at your misery
While the white of the curtain closing crushes your heart
The inertia of loneliness tears your flesh apart

It's a long slow slide
It's a long slow slide
Down

Once the neon is gone
There's still that golden splinter at your side
His manners are charming
But who are you fooling
You're still nobody's bride
And Bukowski's widow
Haunts each empty seat on the Ferris wheel
As ghoulish lovers collide in a collage of kisses that they steal

[Chorus]

And outside your window you can see the circus it's lurching
with rings of smoke
You laugh halfheartedly at the punchline
Not realizing they've made you the joke
And inside you're heart a war is raging
A region still untamed
The worst fear I can imagine is for the mystery to be named
Is for the mystery to be named

Fixing their hairdos with PC, chemical-free hairspray

I'm too far from home, all alone on the road
Trying to figure out who I am now the the stardust has turned to sand

And I moved his ex-old lady's things out of the closet
The same closet I had to move my things back in

Trying to make the world make sense out of me
Trying to be loved completely, trying to love honestly
Trying to find a decent high noon cup of tea
In another hotel
I'm trying to listen to the leaves speak
Trying to steal secrets from fishes in the creek
Trying to figure out who I am
a pretty mediocre cook, an even worse mathematician, maybe a mother someday
What will it be?

I'm trying to figure out who I am

Attempts to speak
My pen is present but
Courage left via the sink

From behind

And I'm sorry that
Jesus died for my sins
And I swear to God
It won't happen again

Tempted you to sway

You quite understand""

To explain it like this

By the old olive tree

Ruined your day

Rang unheard in the air

That you didn't care

Her neon lamp
Kissed Neptune

On a stamp

Could get across

And tiptoed upstairs

And swaddled in bliss

With its silver tongue

But I have just one

Thinking about us maybe
Taking a break was a good thing

That love is a garden if you let it go
It fades away before you know

Come on, baby, let's make up for what we've been missing

Jewel,"Oh the night draws on and on
Now that you're gone
Now that you're far away
My thoughts seem to stray

I sit alone and stare
Even though you're not there
Even though you're not mine
Forever I'll pine

[Chorus]
You may call me foolish
Oh I try and you know it'll be true
But I don't wanna be loved
By anybody but you
No, I don't want to be loved
By anybody but you

Sit alone all day
Hours pass that way
Wishing you were here
Holding me dear

[Chorus]

At night when I'm home
I listen for the phone
Waiting for it to ring
At night in my bed
Thoughts go wonderin'
If you feel the same

[Chorus]",Loved by You (Cowboy Waltz)
Jewel,"The doorway frames you
A picture perfect silhouette,
Blue sky of regret
Enough to hang you
Your legs seem to tremble
At least I imagine that they do
Then again, it's probably easy for you

[Chorus]
But please, don't open your mouth, my dear
I can read all the signs
I can take it from here
There's no need to explain,
It's perfectly clear

Yellow wallpaper peels makes
A strange halo around your head
It's funny how I notice
These stupid things instead
You say something awkward
But I wish that you wouldn't
A whole life of You wish you coulds
But just couldn't

[Chorus]

So I try not to think to much
It only just makes me mad,
Spent half my life loving you
Think of all the love that I could've had

Five years worth of kisses
Are packed in your bags
This tiny moment fits
All the big things we ever had
And I can't quite pinpoint
When it left or what for
Love always steps lightly
Away from the door

Please, don't open your mouth, my dear
I can read all the signs,
I can take it from here
There's no need to explain,
No, there's no need to explain,
It's perfectly clear",Perfectly Clear
Jewel,"Mick came home late last night
He drank enough beer to take the edge off a knife
And she opened the door, looking older than before

He said, ""Rosey, you're too good a girl""
She let him in, he lifted up her dress
Like an apology began to kiss her neck
And he felt much relieved as the ceiling fan tapped out a broken melody

And she said, ""Do you remember when we were younger and angry words were said,
Making up was always your favorite part
Well, I ain't young no more
And I'm sorry will not mend a broken heart.""

He came home threw his things on the floor
She worked up the courage to say what she never had before
But the words got lost inside
He got that look in his eye as the sun went shining on

And she said, ""Do you remember when we were younger and angry words were said,
Making up was always your favorite part
Well, I ain't young no more
And I'm sorry will not mend a broken heart.""

Well the judge knew well Mick was a violent man
She got a few headlines, she got a slap on the hand
And there ain't no villains and there ain't no heroes
People on both sides of the tracks trying to add up a whole bunch of zeros
And time marches on until it's all gone

And she said, ""Do you remember when we were younger and angry words were said,
Making up was always your favorite part
Well, I ain't young no more
And I'm sorry will not mend a broken heart.""",Rosey and Mick
Jewel,"I guess you could say I'm one of those girls
That's always been with one of those guys
You know the type
Like right now, he sleeps while I write
But it's better than crying
I'm worn out from trying
From loving a man who always makes it clear
I'm not welcome here
Just till he's horny and hungry
or needs something cleaned
And you know what I mean

But not tonight
'Cause come the morning light, oh
I'm gonna love myself more than anyone else
Believe in me, even if someone can't see
The stronger woman in me

I'm going to be my own best friend
Stick with me till the end
Won't lose myself again, never, no,
'Cause there's a stronger woman,
A stronger woman in me

Light bulbs buzz,
I get up
And head to my drawer
I wish there was more
I could say
Another fairytale fades to gray
I've lived on hope
Just like a child
Walking that mile
Faking that smile
All the while
Wishing my heart had wings

Well tonight, I'm going to be
The kind of woman I'd want my daughter to be, oh

I'm gonna love myself more than anyone else
Believe in me, even if someone can't see
There's a stronger woman in me
I'm gonna be my own best friend
Stick with me till the end
I won't lose myself again, never, no
'Cause there's a stronger woman,
A stronger woman

This is me, packing up my bags
And this is me, headed for the door
And this is me, the best you ever had
I'm going to love myself

More than anyone else
Believe in me even if someone cannot see
There's a stronger woman in me
I'm going to be my own best friend
Stay with me till the end
Won't lose myself again, never, no

There's a stronger woman,
A stronger woman in me",Stonger Woman
Jewel,"This feeling in my heart
Can't start to describe what you mean to me
Sweet mystery
When I'm lying in my bed
The thoughts that fill my head
Well, they're ecstasy
Baby can't you see

[Chorus]
I think I will,
I think I might let go
Let myself fall
It does not really matter
If we speak at all
'Cause in the darkness
I swear, I hear the language of your heart
And it says, ""Thump Thump,
Let's jump,
Let's fall in love""

Well this house is not home
If I'm left alone
Without you in my bed
I roll around like a marble instead
And you're holding me tight
All through the night,
I miss you by my side
No, it's not right

[Chorus]

Melodies appear
Every time your near
The scent of your skin
Moves me, oh, sin
Your skin, well it does me in
So get yourself over here

Because it does not matter
If we speak at all
'Cause in the darkness
I swear, I hear
The language of your heart
And it says, ""Thump Thump""
And it says, ""Thump Thump""
And it says, it says ""Thump Thump""

Let's fall in love""","Thump, Thump"
Jewel,"Call me soon as your plane gets in
I'll tell you where to take the cab
Can't talk now in the middle of this crowd
But baby, I miss you so bad

I got a bottle of wine
Some stolen time
Key to a room where you can be all mine

[Chorus]
Till it feels like cheating
Till it feels that good
Nobody's leaving
So let's get it understood
Oh you could be a stranger
It's been that long
There's something 'bout the danger of feeling like we're doing something wrong

Let's make the love that we needed
Till it feels like cheating

Don't say a word when you walk in
We ain't got time for that
Kiss me hard like we're about to sin
And there ain't no going back

For a while we'll be free, just you and me
Making promises life won't let us keep

[Chorus]

Let's make the love that we needed
Till it feels like cheating

Keeping the spark going is an everyday fight
So I sent the kids to your mama
And baby, we got all night

Let's make the love that we needed
Till it feels like cheating
Oh yeah, baby
Let's make the love that we needed
Till it feels like cheating",Till It Feels Like Cheating
Jewel,"I watch you while you're sleeping
Messy hair, chest bare
Moonlight on your skin
I wanna breathe you in
In the silence words come easy
I can tell you now just how simple it's been
To let you in
Don't move this mood is a painting
We'll never find the same thing

[Chorus]
Love do not make a sound
Melt into me now
Two become one

Love is so close to hurting
With a shake we could wake
From our own dreaming
We must make a vow
'Cause I have waited a lifetime
Now is the right time

[Chorus]

Like a bird owns it's wings
Like song belongs to melody
You belong to me
I fold your arms around me
Let you flesh, your breath, your love surround me
Oh you feel like home

Oh let's make time stand still
Let this moment last until

Agree you and me
Should be a team

And they walk on parade
Say that we were made
To be a team

And my heart flutters
When you're near
Oh longing to hear you call me dear

And all the rainbows
Say that they know
We're a perfect pair

And the clouds up in the sky
Say they can see it from way up high
We're a perfect pair

And my ways weaken beneath your will
And before you I am trembling and still

All the birds know it
One and one is two
All the bees see it
Tell me why don't you

And all the light of the sun
Doesn't help me out none
'Cause you still can't see me.",All the Animals
Jewel,"Lullaby, and good night, in the skies stars are bright
May the moon, silvery beams, bring you with dreams
Close you eyes, now and rest, may these hours be blessed
Till the sky's bright with dawn, when you wake with a yawn

Lullaby, and good night, you are mother's delight
I'll protect you from harm, and you'll wake in my arms

Sleepyhead, close your eyes, for I'm right beside you
Guardian angels are near, so sleep without fear
Lullaby, and good night, with roses be-dight
Lilies o'er head, lay thee down in thy bed

Lullaby, and good night, you are mother's delight
I'll protect you from harm, and you'll wake in my arms

Lullaby, and sleep tight, my darling sleeping
On sheets white as cream, with the head full of dreams
Sleepyhead, close your eyes, I'm right beside you
Lay thee down now and rest, may you slumber the best

Go to sleep, little one, think of puppies and kittens.
Go to sleep, little one, think of butterflies in spring.
Go to sleep, little one, think of sunny bright mornings.
Hush, darling one, sleep through the night
Sleep through the night
Sleep through the night",Brahms' Lullaby
Jewel,"If you see me speak without words
Know that I am speaking of the wind
And if you see my words like wind
Know that soft tongues cut through stone
And if you see my tongue like stone
Know it's wisdom lies in silence
And if you see my wisdom in silence
Then with you I will always be

And if you doubt my true love is true
Just see how you have no chains upon your hands
And if you see you wear no chains
You are free like poor men
And if you see your freedom in being poor
Pleased you'll be with the treasure of your mind
And if you're pleased with the treasure of your mind
Then with you I will always be

So come closer my love, to me
You are closer than you can ever see
You live in my heart
That's where you'll always be

And if you wonder how it is that I love
Just watch the sun set slip away
And as you watch that sun slip away
Know some things are better left unseen
And if you know some things go unseen
Then night shall carry you in her arms
And if you feel I carry you in my arms
Then with you I will always be
With you I will always be.",Circle Song

Sweet sweet angel
Come to me to swiftly
This night is so still

For dawn does come swiftly

But it's face is so lovely
It keeps my faith strong

My hands are unsteady
I'm so far from home
But just tell me angel
I'm never alone

Lay with me angel
And speak not a word

I'll be with you angel

Where love will go
Beyond today?""

How long am I gonna cry feel like I'm gonna die 
Trying to forget 
Is this as bad as it gets?

Tonight tell me I've 
Seen the worst of this jagged knife 
Deep inside my broken heart 
He'll only leave a scar

Is this as bad as it gets? 
Is this as hard as it seems?

Is this the way it feels with a dagger through your heart 
When you're falling to your knees ripped and torn apart 
How long am I gonna cry feel like I'm gonna die 
Trying to forget 
Is this as bad as it gets?

I close my eyes 
So I can't see you leaving",Bad as It Gets
Jewel,"It's Walmart, the bathroom
I'm staring in the mirror
Florescent lights are bright
It makes the lines clearer
Where did the Angel go?
Cigarette smoke's all that's left
I've traded my wings in for a string of pearls
And a string is all I've left

The lighbulbs burn
Someone's in the stall
Big whites, brick wall
Makes me feel small
And I take my shirt off
Looking for a glimpse of flesh
Peel back the concrete
Hope there's something that true left

'Cause I am fading
I am fading
I am fading away
I am fading just like fairytales
And a hero loses faith
I am fading

The air smells like urine
It's gettin' hard to breathe
I could walk out that door
But no one ever really leaves
And I take my clothing off
Trying not to forget
Stupid things like the color of rain
And the smell of stone when it's wet

I am fading
I am fading
I am fading away
I am fading just like fairytales
And a hero loses faith

And I am naked in the mirror
With a feather in my hand
A lady comes out of the bathroom screaming
""Oh Jesus!""
She couldn't understand
But I ask her, ""Hey, what happens to us when we get old and in the way?""
I guess she answered me
Cause they, they took me away

And I am fading
I am fading
I am fading away
I am fading just like fairytales
And a hero loses faith

And I don't know how
And I don't know when
Don't know when I forgot
Hope I'll remember again
I am fading away
I am fading",Fading
Jewel,"You and I walking slowly
Hand in hand
Footprints in the sand
Watch the wind as it plays
Throwing shadows across your face
The sky was so blue
Your eyes so green
The air glittering
So sudden, so swift
Love came to us
Just like a gift
I lived here, you lived far away
Our lives called us back, no we could not stay
With a sad sort of smile you took my hand
Said while we're apart you hope I understand that

You'll be holding me
And I'll be holding you
Through those long nights
My love will be pulling you through
When you see the stars
Pretend they're my arms
When you feel the air
That is me kissing you there
Say you love me
And I will say I love you
No distance could ever make that untrue
When I'm far away
I'll reach through time and space
When you hear the wind
You'll hear me saying
I love you forever

Fast forward our love story
I still remember that day
Her small precious face
You stared into her eyes
Hypnotized by her smile
But your job meant you had to travel
But we weren't ready for you to go
You held our daughter with a sad sort of smile
Said while we're apart I want you to know that

You'll be holding me
And I'll be holding you
Through those long nights
My love will be pulling you through
When you see the stars
Pretend they're my arms
When you feel the air
That is me kissing you there
Say you love me
And I will say I love you
No distance could ever make that untrue
When I'm far away
I'll reach through time and space
When you hear the wind
You'll hear me saying
I love you forever

God forbid there'll come a day
When the light in my eyes fades away
But from your heart I will not go
No bounds shall my spirit know, cause

You'll be holding me
And I'll be holding you
Through those long nights
My love will be pulling you through
When you see the stars
Pretend they're my arms
When you feel the air
That is me kissing you there
Say you love me
And I will say I love you
No distance could ever make that untrue
When I'm far away
I'll reach through time and space
When you hear the wind
You'll hear me saying
I love you forever

You'll be holding me
And I'll be holding you
Through those long nights
My love will be pulling you through
When you see the stars
Pretend they're my arms
When you feel the air
That is me kissing you there
Say you love me
And I will say I love you
No distance could ever make that untrue
When I'm far away
I'll reach through time and space
When you hear the wind
You'll hear me saying
I love you forever",I Love You Forever
Jewel,"Shut up sweetheart, there's something I need you to hear
I can no longer love the same thing I fear
I won't stay close
To the one thing that hurts the most
I won't kiss the thorn
Hearts don't need to bleed to know what they're for

There'll be no more heartaches
No more heartaches for me
Can't you see

I take back my sweetness
It's overlooked by your lust
And my sorrows are unseen
Cause your touch is too tough
You can't adore
The subtlety of me anymore
I'll unfasten myself from your side
And slip away, quiet as a sigh

And I gotta tell ya
I think the whole world's goin' crazy
Everytime I turn around someone is selling somethin' new
It's gettin so bad, I don't believe anything anyone tells me
But baby you have the most honest eyes
Maybe you're the peice I'm missing in my life

[Chorus]
I'm lookin' for one true thing
One true thing that I can believe in
Searchin' for one real love
All my life I have been waitin'
For one thing that's true
Could it be you?

Seems like everytime that I'm walking' down the street
No one even looks me in the eye
Everyone's got an angle
Everyone's got agendas and a secret to keep
And that is the one thing on which you can rely
But when you look at me I think I see somethin' new
Tell me baby, can I put my faith in you?

[Chorus]

So tell me before I go too far
Tell me now before I give you my heart
I'm lookin' for one real love, all my life
I have been waitin'

Jewel,"You take your coat off and throw it on the floor
Night delivers you to my arms once more
You feel so familiar as you get into bed
Cigarette smoke halo around you head
You lean over and kiss me so sweet
Nobody wake me if this is a dream

I'm gonna build myself a summer home
Build myself a summer home in your arms

I kiss you with the languid adoration of slumber
Landin' random as lotto numbers
One on each eye
And, oops, one on your nose
And ten for each of your cute little toes
You lean over and kiss me so sweet
Nobody wake me if this is a dream

I'm gonna build myself a summer home
Build myself a summer home in your arms

Some people build with wood and brick
Some people build with stone and stick
I'm gonna build mine kiss by kiss

I'm gonna build myself a summer home
Build myself a summer home in your arms

I'm a bit of a mess and I'm gone too much
But when I'm away it's you I long to touch
And certain things remind me it's such a special treat
As these little things that bring you to me
Like when you lean over and kiss me so sweet
Nobody wake me if this is a dream

I'm gonna build myself a summer home
Build myself a summer home in your arms

Built with all your charms",Summer Home in Your Arms
Jewel,"Whoever said that love is easy, must've never been in love,
Sometimes its a landmine, one wrong step and it blows up,
A word, a look, lights a hidden fuse.

It's hard to see just what you have, when you're seeing red,
And easy to do something that you know you will regret,
Better stop, think, count to ten before I leave.

One, I still wanna hate you,
Two, three, I still wanna leave,
Four, searching for that door,
Five, then I look into your eyes,
Six, take a deep breathe,
Seven, take a step back,
Eight, nine, I don't know why we even started this fight,
By the time I get to ten, I'm right back in your arms again.

Words thrown so callously like weapons when we fight,
But when they cut too deep, I wanna leave it all behind,
I have to count to ten, before I cross that line.

One, I still wanna hate you,
Two, three, I still wanna leave,
Four, I'm searching for that door,
Five, then I look into your eyes,
Six, take a deep breathe,
Seven, take a step back,
Eight, nine, I don't know why, we even started this fight,
By the time I get to ten, I'm right back in your arms again.

You can lose what you're not thankful for,
I don't want that to happen to you and me,
Better count my blessings.

One, you still move me,
Two, three, you send chills right through me,
Four, you keep me wanting more,
Five, when I look into your eye,
Six, you're my best friend,
Seven, that'll never end,
Eight, nine, I don't know why, but thank God it happens every time,
By the time I get to ten,
By the time I get to ten,
I can see how blessed I've been.

I choose you all over again.",Ten
Jewel,"I'm driving around town
Kinda bored with the windows rolled down
See a girl on the bus stop bench
Dressed to draw attention

Hoping everyone will stare
If she don't stand out she thinks she'll disappear
Wish I could hold her, tell her, show her
What she wants is already there

A star is a star
It doesn't have to try to shine
Water will fall
A bird just knows how to fly

You don't have to tell a flower how to bloom
Or light how to fill up a room
You already are what you are
And what you are is beautiful

Heard a story the other day
Took place at the local VA
A father talking to his dying son
This was his conversation

""It's not supposed to be like this
You can't go first I can't handle it.""
The boy said ""Dad now don't you cry,
Remember when I was a child what you used to tell me when I'd ask why?""

You'd say gravity is gravity
It doesn't try to pull you down
Stone is stone
It can't help but hold it's ground

The wind just blows, though you can't see
It's everywhere like I'll always be
You already are what you are
And what you are is strong enough

Look in the mirror
Now that's another story to tell
I give love to others
But I give myself hell

I'd have to tell myself
""In every scene there's a perfect plan""
Everything I hoped to be
I already am

A flower is a flower
It doesn't have to try to bloom
And light is light
Just knows how to fill a room

And dark is dark
So the stars have a place to shine
The tide goes out
So it can come back another time

Goodbye makes a love so sweet
And love is love so it can teach us
We already are what we are
And what we are is beautiful

And strong enough
And good enough
And bright enough",What You Are

Yes I too was just like you,
Finding comfort in a strangers face,
In some darkened place where no one knew my name

And I was sad to see that I would never be the same
But without you by my side I'd go insane,

Set down you chains, until only faith remains

No longer lent your strength to that

Fill you lives with love and bravery

But if praying were enough it would have come to be

Let your words enslave no one and the heavens will hush themselves

With sounds of freedom

Come on you unbelievers, move out of the way
There is a new army coming and we are armed with faith
To live, we must give

He sings to him sweetly and calls him Sam 
He's happy 
So happy 

And do you see the lady with the long black beard 
Its her pride and joy 
She's been growing it for years 
She's happy 
So happy 

So may I caution you and say beware 
Before you dare judge and stare 

'Cause everybody has to be something 
Its a lot better than just being nothing 
Everybody has to be something

We all know Mary she has fifty cats 
And all day long she is giving them baths 
It makes her happy

Arnold is a hermit
He gets lots of weird looks 
Because all of his friends 
Well, they live inside of books 
But they make him happy

You never know what it takes 
For someone to be glad in their own way 

'Cause everybody has to be something 
Its a lot better than just being nothing 
Everybody has to be something 
Whatever makes 'em happy 

We can see pieces of our self
In the reflection of everyone else 
So judging them is like judging yourself 
Instead of just being happy 

I know a lady 
Who dances on her bed 
Only she can hear the music 
'Cause it's in her head 
But she's happy
So happy 

So be as different as you want 
It's even more fun than you thought

Its a lot better than just being nothing

Jewel,"I wanna say welcome to a wonderland 
An amusement park full of delights and 
The best part is they have one in every town 
its your local market where you ride a cart around 

They have stacks of candy in every isle 
And every kind of cereal that goes on for miles 
Flour and milk that can be made 
Into brown gravy for supper Sunday 

They got 50 pound bags of chicken nuggets 
They got yummy yogurt by the bucket. 
Shelves and shelves of home made stuffin’ 
Oh what a treat 

That's what I love about the grocery store 
They have everything that you could want and so much more 
Its so hard to keep my hands inside the cart 
But I better try or mom won't bring me back no more 

They got sweet and sour stir fried rice 
They got Alaskan salmon sitting on ice
They got blue corn chips and bagel bites 
Coconut in a can 

And if your from the south you'll be really pleased 
They have black eyed peas and collared greens 
And if you're from the North there's stuff just for you
Like king crab legs and Eskimo pie, too 

They have lots of veggies so you'll grow up tall 
Beef and chicken so you'll be strong and all 
The dairy to help build unbreakable bones 
Hey, ice cream counts, at least I think so 

They have chocolate chip cookies and pecan snookies 
And pop corn snacks where its says on the back 
You get a toy surprise like x-ray glasses for your eyes
There's croissant rolls, jelly rolls, soda fountains overflow
If I don't get my snow cone my head will explode 

They got barbecue chicken with all the fixings
Sweet buttermilk for buttermilk biscuits
Brownies in a box, just water and mix em’
Oh oh, um um good

Yes, its so hard to keep my hands inside the cart 
But I better try or mom won't bring me back no more

From loving a man who always makes it clear

Or needs something cleaned

I'm gonna love myself, more than anyone else

A stronger woman in me

Head to my drawer
I wish there was more

Faking that smile

Wishing my heart had wings

Stick with me till the end
Won't lose myself again, never, no
'Cause there's a stronger woman,
A stronger woman

This is me, packing up my bags
And this is me, headed for the door
This is me, the best you ever had.

I'm going to love myself
More than anyone else
Believe in me even if someone cannot see
The stronger woman in me
I'm going to be my own best friend
Stay with me till the end
Won't lose myself again, no, no

Jewel,"You're the ship, I'm the wreck
You're the bomb, I'm a tick
You're the pause before the fall
I'm a crash that follows it all

We are one, we are whole
We are one whole dying soul
We're the crash, the burn,
The dream that turns from ecstasy to aching,
We-e-e-e-e are the sound of two hearts breaking

You're the blink, I'm the eye
You're the shiver, I'm the knife
You're the crutch, I'm the break
You're the emptiness I make

We are one, we are whole
We are one whole dying soul
We're the crash, the burn,
The dream that turns from ecstasy to aching,
We-e-e-e-e are the sound of two hearts breaking

And drying big tears from crying all these years
And I know this is your nightmare come true
I never wanted this for you
But I'm the teeth, you're the heart
Together we're the start of the inhale and a scream
You're the not waking,
I'm the not dreaming

We are

We are one, we are whole
We are one whole dying soul
We're the crash, the burn,
The dream that turns from ecstasy to aching,

Jewel,"I hear the clock, it's six a.m.
I feel so far away from where I've been
I got my eggs, I got my pancakes too
I got maple syrup, everything but you
I break the yolks and make a smiley face
I kinda like it in my brand new place
Wipe the spots off of the mirror
Don't leave the keys in the door
I never put wet towels on the floor anymore 'cause

Dreams last for so long, even after you're gone
I know, you love me
And soon you will see, you were meant for me
And I was meant for you

I called my momma, she was out for a walk
Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't want to talk
So I picked up a paper, it was more bad news
More hearts being broken or people being used
Put on my coat in the pouring rain
I saw a movie it just wasn't the same 'cause
It was happy, I was sad
It made me miss you oh so bad 'cause

Dreams last so long, even after you're gone
I know, you love me
And soon you will see, you were meant for me
And I was meant for you

I go about my business, I'm doing fine
Besides, what would I say if I had you on the line
Same old story, not much to say
Hearts are broken every day

I brush my teeth I put the cap back on
I know you hate it, when I leave the light on
I pick a book up, and turn the sheets down
And take a deep breath and a good look around

Put on my pj's and hop into bed
I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead
I try and tell myself it'll be all right
I shouldn't think anymore tonight 'cause

Dreams last so long, even after you're gone
I know, you love me
And soon I know you will see, you were meant for me
And I was meant for you, yeah

Jewel,"Oh, the weather outside is frightful 
But the fire is so delightful 
And since we've no place to go 
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Jewel,"She stepped off of the boat to see flowers in his hands
The man she would marry was as hard as the mountains
She had his children in a log cabin
Soon I'd be another star in this family's constellation
In the land of the midnight sun
Searching for gold
I am my father's daughter
He has his mother's eyes
I am the product of her sacrifice
I am the accumulation of the dreams of generations
And their stories live in me like holy water
I am my father's daughter

My father raised me in an old log cabin
And he sang for me the songs his mother sang to him
In honky-tonks, and empty bars, just me and him
And that old guitar
He passed on a legacy wrapped up in a melody
And I carry on
Searching for gold

I am my father's daughter
I have his eyes
I am the product of his sacrifice
I am the accumulation of the dreams of generations
And their stories live in me like holy water
I am my father's daughter

And every time I step on stage

And the music finds me

I don't need gold to remind me

I am my father's daughter
I have my Grandma's eyes
I am the product of such sacrifice

I am the accumulation of the dreams of generations
And their stories live in me like holy water
I am my father's daughter
Oh, I am my father's daughter",My Father’s Daughter
Jewel,"So much space can fit in a sigh
More than words can say
I'm left here with my hands all awkward
Trying to mend space

I used to know you
But not anymore
Your substance has been subtracted
Word by word

Silence in my ears
Where once you offered your conviction
Your promises are dried beats
They're cracked with nostalgia

But that's all right 
That's okay
Had no business
Giving myself to you anyway
Be careful next time for sure
And I'll
I'll never trust my pink fleshy heart
I'll never trust my pink fleshy heart
To a carnivore
Carnivore

Your soul is an ink stain
Your perfection is amend
You're as fragile as your thoughtlessness
As strong as you can bend

You could only believe in embryos
Held all your high hopes through a telescope
Lavender haunted you
So I could own your life in yellow 

You have a fire down in genius, subtlety
And you slip through the fingers of ambiguity

Well, that's all right 
That's okay
Had no business
Giving myself to you anyway
Be careful next time for sure
And I'll

But I won't do it again
This time I'll be my own best friend
And I'll take back my song and my poetry 
This time i won't be so easy to read

Jewel,"Mama, I see your face now in the mirror
It's getting clearer
Daddy, all those things I said I wouldn't do
I've been drawn to 'cause I looked up to you
And I've loved you through this tangled legacy
Tracing the twisted roots of our family tree

I stayed strong like you did
I moved on like you did
And I wound up tough as stone like you did
If I don't learn to bend I know I'm going to break
Like you did

Lover, I must forgive you
I confused you with what I couldn't see inside of me
Dark things pulling, not evolving
It made a puppet out of me
And you came with your own history
Both caught in the branches of our family tree

I stayed strong like you did
I moved on like you did
And I wound up all alone like you did
If I don't learn to bend, I know I'm gonna break just like you did

I love you but I need to look at who we've been
Take the fruit but choose the seeds I scatter in the wind
That's the job of the kid: to do better than our parents did

So I'll stay strong like you did
And I'll move on like you did
But I won't hide from the truth like you did
I'm learning to bend so I won't break
And you can bet I'll teach my child 
that love will always find a way just like you did",Family Tree
Jewel,"It doesn't hurt right now
I can breathe again
There's change in the air I can see and hear
It doesn't hurt right now
And I can talk about it
The worst of the shape is the least of my fears

Could you ever see
Just you and me
Alone in this room
Or does he make it three?
I'm sorry sounds so small
Compared to what's true
I lied to myself
When I lied to you

It doesn't hurt right now
I can hear what you had to say
I can forgive but forget not yet
It doesn't hurt right now
But we both know it will again
Ghosts of the past based on regret

Needs are like rivers
You can't stop their will
A heart that goes hungry
Demands to be filled
I see that now
I was lonely and I took the bait
But I long to be filled by you, it's never too late

It doesn't hurt right now
So what does that say about me
I learned to be known a long time ago
To soften the blow
It doesn't hurt right now

I hurt right now

And I know what you want from me

Oh, won't you give it to me

And though we're through,
My first lonely nights without you.

From this darkness on all your nights will be this way

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

Gotta get this paper, get this cake up
Gotta do my hair, gotta put on makeup
Gotta act like I care about this fake stuff
Straight up what a waste of my day
If I had it my way I'd roll out of bed
Say bout 2:30 mid day
Hit the blunt then, hit you up to come over to my place
You show up right away
We make love then and then we fuck
And then you'd give me my space
Hey

What I am trying to say is
The love is ours to make so we should make it
Everything else can wait
The time is ours to take so we should take it

Wake up, wake up, bake up
Gotta heat the vape up
Lets get faded
Gotta call your job tell em' you won't make it
Ain't nobody here baby lets get wasted
We should just get naked
'Cause I be working hard and I know you be on that same shit
Every other day's a different game that you just can't win
I just want to ease your mind and make you feel all right
So go head tell your baby mama you gon be with me tonight
Right

What I am trying to say is
The love is ours to make, so we should make it
Everything else can wait
The time is ours to take so we should take it

It's not love, but it's pretty close
Hot fudge and a little smoke
I didn't mean it means nothing to you
Hands locked on my black couch with nothing to do
Can't stop on cloud 20
Buried in the drugs, but the feels keeps coming
Finally stop crying, but your nose is still running
Wipe it on my shirt, haha I need sleep
You tell me that you wanna do it big
I love it when you say ""guess what?"" (What? What?)
Reading stories to some other nigga kid
And I wonder why I'm all messed up (up up up up)
'Cause we gotta be responsible sometimes
Being a class act nevermind my alumni
I don't wanna be a round a baby so dumb high
I don't see the beauty of a momma on insides
Curled up with my head on your chest
It's the best remedy for the pain and the stress
If the world doesn't change then we'll never get dressed
It will be like this to the kiss of the death
Of my soul, bowl of the blue dream, no
Not a good team, once soul, two halves
No joke, who laughs?
Just us (Just us, just us)

Okay, got this OJ and Jose
Mixed it up with that Rose
We gon' do this our own way
Alright, okay
What is it that your smoking?
Piece it up with this peace and love
And this peace and love like the old days

What I am trying to say is
The love is ours to make so we should make it
Everything else can wait
The time is ours to take so we should take it

We should lay right here

Any other instant
Here in this dimension
You and I are meant to be
I have waited lifetimes to find you
Now that you're here
I can remind you
Of the things you've been dreamin'
Times two
I promise you
If you just give me 24
Man, all I need is 24 hours
I promise you'll want plenty more
You'll probably be with it forever
So how does it sound
Us on the ground
Giving you my love?
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
You gotta stay ready
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
That's why I stay ready

Tell me find your spot with the warning that I might slip
And when you climb on top that's the ultimate road trip
Ride on my like your Pac got me thinkin' it's 96'
I can rap on some nineties shit, wrap your leggings around my hip
I'm so hip to it tourists want to come speculate
But if I stay monogamous promise this kiss will always taste like candy
And yea, it's obvious momma now probably can't stand me
I'm sure they're tired of this look that you have when you're antsy
We gon' fuck around (Mm) we gon' fuck around
And triple through triplets of babies right now
And that might break the record and no, that don't mean you're fertile
That means we're fucking reckless, plus we don't use protection
I find myself reading old text messages when I'm bored
We find ourselves sexting 'til that connection is restored
I know that sounds immature, but if we never grow up
Then I wish you good luck on the seas that's inside this wall

Come to me
Come, come to me
Look at what you've done to me
You put a gun to me
Then you brought the sun to me

Shine like blood diamonds
Learning to have patience
Only cause you are timeless
The universe energy doesn't lie
And this chemistry is infinity at a million
Times
I wrote a million rhymes to scrabble your
Star power
Now the 24 bars, you get 24 hours

There's no better time than now
You gotta stay ready
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now

But I be on my shit man
I decided
That what you give
Is what you're given

I been doin' like
Whatever gets me through the night

What a life

I'm steady always on the go
You steady always on the go
We steady losin' all control

What a life

They say
The truth ain't pretty
But comin' from that pretty mouth
The truth is fitting
'Cause you ain't never talkin' loud
And you know plenty
Yea you know what I'm talkin' bout
'Cause you just get me
Yeah you so pretty

If everything is dipped in gold
Then baby it will never grow
Everything sweet ain't sugar coated

Rollin' in my ride
So I gotta take it slow

Up, up and away we go
Racing to the sky

Can save us
And take us
And make us believe
That we are free

The falling from the sky
Just remind of the days when you was crying for attention
I ignored it as a phase until you couldn't
Take the tension
Now I wish you would have stayed
Walking through the smoke and mirrors
I'm burdened, you burning bridges
Memories fading, faded it help you to not remember
The trials and tribulations
Eyes red from crying
The perfect way to disguise it you was
Blinded by our fate
Please don't rain on my parade because this
Float was built for you
Kinda hard to chase you down when you
Floating through the room
All you wanted was the truth and all I wanted was my way

See I just lost my smile

If that is fine with you, it's fine with me
Definitely love

Infinite love, yeah
I've been wrong before
But this time I am for sure
It's you
Something you did made me feel it deep in my core

Jhené Aiko,"She was born in limbo
With the need to be as simple
As her makers and the made up things she dreamed
Falling from high buildings 'til she
Was numb to the feeling really
She would never be quite what she seemed
She was just as hollow as a
Earth opened up, swallowing her
Off the grid and into paradise, her whole life on a ride
Her whole life was on a ride, on a ride, life was on a ride

Sailing through the cosmic seas
Her celestial frequency was needed
To fulfill the prophecy
She was too real to believe in
Though if they would, she could free them
From the truth that they've been told a lie, their whole life
On a ride, yeah whole life was on a ride, on a ride
Life is on a ride, your whole life is on a ride
Your whole life is on a ride

Your whole life is on a ride, always wondered why
Use to be so different you were not this type of guy
Always set aside all your extra pride
Then you started trippin' different bitches on the side
And I am not surprised, no I am not surprised
You always demanded things that I could not supply
And I could not survive
If you don't have survival then I cannot take that ride
Your whole life is on a ride, your whole life is on a ride

The city heard, the sounds of a pretty bird
Yelling from Slauson to 53rd
What happens if you holla and can't be heard?
For the birds and the drama, I paint these words
They say through the pain is how we learn
You landed on the window of pain, simple and plain
It's hard for you to fly in the rain
The way love goes is not the way that it came
Come fly, un-die, be born again
I've seen the strongest of them be torn from men
Ripped apart and get put back together
Them the ones with the most beautiful feathers
Lets, flock together, rock together, Nirvana
A birds persona to be free and honor

Unafraid of the unknown and now we know why

[Chorus]
We ride Big Big cars on them Big Big rims
And we rock Big clothes with them Big Big timbs
Got big cribs 'cause we got big crib
Imma real big kid 'cause we do it real big

Flow so hot
V.V.S. diamonds in my big big watch you know I got it on lock
Keep a chick on my arm more than a watch
She started lookin' at my fingers maybe 'cause of the rocks
And now the G's on the block shock like the watch
It's like a car show when I open up my garage
Vipers Maserati's Lamborghini drop tops
Cuty Cuty hydraulics once we drop it like it's hot
It's all on tape matter fact you all are fake
So that four will make ya head alternate
'Cause while I'm stabbin' and jabbin' you get to rappin' and actin'
And try to make it a habit but tricks ain't for silly rabbits
Flawless style will make you shake
Girls cry me a river like Timberlake
That's like the music that's trapped in a stereo wrapped in
A Gift that you rap so you ain't hearin' jack then

[Chorus: x2]

Pull up in a whip
They wanna see the T.I.P. of my clip think I betta' get a grip
My money like the Olympics I gotta make a flip
I never recall fallin' but I got to take a trip
I'm livin' on cribs while u dreamin' in ya cribs
So all you big babies can keep on ya bibs
Stayin' on tour while my album gettin' shipped
Tryin' to get four picks plain bus car ships
So give it a break and still call Jibbs the great
You need to chill wit ya grill sayin' Jibbs a fake
Cause while you be grillin' ya boy Jibbs be chillin'
I'm tryin' to make me some millions put chandeliers in da ceiling
Do it big I'm tryin' to get more on my plate
While you goin' half crazy I put half on a lake
So sixteen's I spit for sixteen you get
By sixteen I'm livin' like sixteen was millions

[Chorus: x2]

Doin' big things rock big clothes
Wit them big big chains and we fly big planes
Copter so fly so we flyin' through the rain
Young Jibbs switching lanes while you dudes being lame
So you know that is hot and can flow like this
Ride in the back of the range and rove like this
Stay iced out let it show like this
I bet you ain't chorus that'll go like this

Gone give it a test 'cause you could do it the best
Just be like Mitchell and Ness, and throw it back, girl

Get wit it have ball and hit with it, trying to get with the crew
Just thought that I?d mention it
Cause I been with it in fact I'm a throw a hit with it
Tried to blow ma mind when she turned around and spent with it

So we could take it on back to the floor ma
If you ain't dancing than you looking at the door ma
And she'll fall if she do a little more ma
Next thing she saw was the Lamborghini doors ha

don't get it twisted I ain't saying you could leave boo
Gone bring it back and you could show me what that thing do
Don't get it twisted I ain't saying you could leave boo
Put it in reverse, [Incomprehensible]

Lets get it on the floor and do what you do

I'm 'bout to start of shopping, you know them tags we popping
Only the freshest I'm rocking, I'm grabbing new fits
It kind of hard to fall but it?s so easy to ball
When I be hitting the mall to grab a new chick

Steady going telling 'bout the party I'm throwing
I'm already knowing that she feeling the way that I'm flowing
Take the girl from her and I'm a bring her out the Lew
Letting her see the palm trees, showing her how Cali do

From burning one to doing the bounce then we hitting the crunk
As soon as we open them and any doors the party gone jump
As soon as we turn up the music the speakers go bump
And any body sitting down we gone tell ?em get up

Now I think it's just time for you to move
It's time for you to hit a home run like a bat girl
I know you heard this before but I'm a tell you some more
So listen carefully while I put it in fast forward

And the way I spit on records, I'm firr as a flame
So you know I keep a chick that's firr az that thang

Four bottom, white gold with them iced out thangs
Make that charger sound almost like a train
Cruising to the hood on the highway

And we switching lanes
I stay fresh, I stay fly in the best clothes
Like the best bowls, wrist gets tech low

A funny guy I'm all the girls? heartthrob
Smoke never rocking square pants like sponge bob
I'm sick with the flow 'cause I'm the hottest
Get to my door and I ain't speaking when they knocking

It?s just about my time to shine
So don't get your eyes wet
'Cause my shine will blind

Comin' up in da hood where the streets are cold
Either you gon? stretch or either you gon? fold
Either you gon? ride or get rolled on
Which one is it or they pay you a visit?

What you gon? do? You gon? ride? You gon? roll?
You gon? stretch? You gon? fold? You gon? keep yo family po?
Comin' up in da hood watchin' my homies take the pressure
That's why I chose to be a mic-checka

What you gon? do? You gon? ball? You gon? fall?
Let 'em knock you into walls? Leave you dead in a hall
Or you gon? keep hanging in the streets with your crew
Don't ask me 'cause I know what I'm a do

But what you gon? do?
Buy the solos with the dodo?s and nogo?s, and fofo?s
In choke holds after getting chased by the po po?s
You gon? ride solo or is you gon? group it?
Or is you gon? think before you start being stupid

Now what chu gon? do? You gon? rob? You gon? kill?
Buy the drugs or you gon? deal or go out and chase a mil
Or on the other hand get a deal like me
And go and write 48 bars to a beat

Tell me what you gon? do? Be another family failure
Disrespectin' all your elders, go livin' in a shelter
Or you gon? get killed put in jail or be a doctor
And own a big house on the roof a helicopter

Whatchu gon? do?
Stay in the same city, same hood, same block
Same homies changing clothes, wearin' each others socks
Or do you wanna go somewhere a life to try to live
And see about a hundred making money, taking trips

Comin' up in da hood where the streets are cold
Either you gon? stretch or either you gon? fold
Either you gon? ride or get rolled on
Which one is it or they pay you a visit?

What you gon? do? Be a fed, be a star, do the dance, hit the bar
Be a face nigga, sharp or go and shop, and stuff
Hit the mall, pop tags, start stuff
Get me red, white and blue like the flag

Jibbs what you gon? do? Gettin' money, stay off the streets
They frontin' man, it ain't funny, I ain't runnin'
Hopin' from place to place like a bunny kinda sunny
Phone on my waist vibrate 'cause it?s comin'
Stay in shape, last in the game is music business funny

For the sake that my hood cats hungry
Tryin' to get a mil deal, bread and bologna

Jibbs,"You a gold digging, I ain't messin' wit
'Cause I'm a rhino, I'm a rhino
And I ain't no, you can go find yo
And tryin' those, and sign no

Go? on and throw the digits or I ain't messin' with no
'Cause I'm a rhino, I'm a rhino
And I ain't no to go find no
And tryin' those and sign no

Ah, my name is Jibbs but they call me mighty trump
The kid down a house with an outer space flow
Stay waved up, poking madden with a flow
Jag chillin' in the back with girls holla at a chump

Who you know gotta sea with a 3 in double beat
I write my own stuff never will I need a ghost
Spit so cold that you prolly need a coat
And I keep bread 'til I bring about a house

Clownin' on stage but Jibbs is no hoe
Lil? Lewis got ?em hangin' from a rope
All my diamonds real, no gold or glass coat
If you all washed up, don't drop the soap

Beastaz the music don't bang that low
It bring ya feet where you can't feel yo toes
And I'm the hottest, come on keep it on the low
And they mad 'cause I riot and I fly like a crow

You a gold digging, I ain't messin' wit
'Cause I'm a rhino, I'm a rhino
And I ain't no, you can go find yo
And tryin' those, and sign no

Go? on and throw the digits or I ain't messin' with no
'Cause I'm a rhino, I'm a rhino
And I ain't no to go find no
And tryin' those and sign no

Spit one?s rhymes one to me is like fire
That's because I gotta spread around like a high
Jibbs and the whole lil' lewis is a try
And we keep goin' higher 'til we see ourselves fly

Spit punch lines, we hit you in ya ear
When I'm at a concert girls be drawin' tears
Move ?em in the dark no havin' no fears
And callin' me a space ship the way I'm switchin' gears

If you a gold digger, I'm platinum plus
Diamond out bizzle, don't let the platinum rust
Boy perfect timing but I ain't gon' speak with glocks
All up in your speakers, they call me speaker box

You a gold digging, I ain't messin' wit
'Cause I'm a rhino, I'm a rhino
And I ain't no, you can go find yo
And tryin' those, and sign no

Go? on and throw the digits or I ain't messin' with no
'Cause I'm a rhino, I'm a rhino
And I ain't no to go find no
And tryin' those and sign no

People when I see themselves, that Jibbs is a beast
One of me is like 5, so move more than 3
Back for I gotta make my money increase
And 5 is the reason why they lock my the key

So if you ain't throwin' then you need to catch a chorus
Keep switchin' timbs, keep trees like a forest
Deal with the rhymes like my sign is a Taurus
And I'm all about mine, you can keep mindin' yours

Now speak for yourself, I'ma keep goin' high
I'm so above average I don't think you wanna try
I?ma tell the truth that I don't have to lie
And I'm beastin' my peer I don't think you wanna try

You can mess with Jibbs, man, I think you won't know
'Cause this rap thing, I been doin long
So you need to sit down with the thing
'Cause I?ma just make your head spin

You a gold digging, I ain't messin' wit
'Cause I'm a rhino, I'm a rhino
And I ain't no, you can go find yo
And tryin' those, and sign no

Go? on and throw the digits or I ain't messin' with no
'Cause I'm a rhino, I'm a rhino
And I ain't no to go find no
And tryin' those and sign no

You a gold digging, I ain't messin' wit
'Cause I'm a rhino, I'm a rhino
And I ain't no, you can go find yo
And tryin' those, and sign no

Go? on and throw the digits or I ain't messin' with no

And the wheels look flat, trunk so heavy in the back
Got the speakers in the front, they be sitting on my lap
Got a bumper to the back, with the trunk weighing it down
Look they think it's a lowrider when they come from my town
That's a King Kong, in the trunk, that's the gorillas behind me

Deep inside you know the truth 
He don't really love you 
Baby, you've gotta face the truth 
You know I'ma keep it real with you 
Let's be real 

I was December in the Chi 
When I saw you walking by 
With the tears in your eyes 
And I walked up to your side 
So I asked you how you feel 
Girl is everything alright 
I want you to keep it real 
Girl you ain't got to lie 
See that dude is a mark 
A predator and a shark 
And I knew that from the start 
He wanted to break your heart 
You ain't got to think twice 
Cause I ain't that type of guy 
I'd rather see you happy 
I don't want to see you cry 
Let's be real, come on now 
Let's be real, he got no love 
Like I have for you, really feeling bad for you 
Out of all of this time he never had love I have for you 

[Chorus]

He disrespect ya, he don't protect ya 
I know it hurts but you got to keep your head up 
He doesn't love ya, but I can treat you better 
That's why I think me and you should be together 
He doesn't need ya, bet I can please ya 
He doesn't trust ya, forever triny to treat ya 
He doesn't look at ya texture 
You should tell him that he really got you messed 
Tell him to beat it, me in your life you need it 

I'm willing to do whatever, you really can't beat it 
I'm your keeper, my words you need to keep it 
Fresher, I could be the reason why you breathing 

[Chorus]

He disrespect ya, he don't protect ya 
When you in need he don't hurry to catch ya 
Hurt and neglect ya, certain to stress ya 
I ain't your daddy girl, you can do whatever 
Let's be for real, come on now, Let's be for real, you know what's 
Up Let's be real, come on now, let's be real, forever ma 

It's best you let him go, or you will never know 
What we could be, why can't you see 
What we could be, why can't you see

Goodbye to Martha's Vineyard
You in a rougher spot here
Reflect on how you got there
The law had you in crosshair
Stop and frisk your kids playing street hockey in lacrosse gear
Son was barely even selling, but when he returns the whole suburb would brand him as a felon
Can't get no job, he can't vote
Family name's ashamed, though he was targeted, we force him to take the blame
As all the blacks just walk past with their yoga mats
Eating their kale like all's well in the cul-de-sac

Last week of the month, they seeking the young, sweeping them up in the wagon
And in the subway, everyday, white girls arrested at random
Cops looking for pills, mother be poppin' so many she never gaggin'
Her life is lagging, wifey has been quite antagonistic
Titties saggin', kids are naggin', acting like some bitches
Do some dishes or something
Husband used to do them, yeah, but he's rarely there
Got various business affairs, busy with affairs
And she's got her would be career
Percocets are near, some dry gin or Vicodin
She could have predicted that the Feds would come for her just like for him
But she was addicted, the biggest fiends today are white women
Middle aged, middle class as you know
‘Twas the same when they blazed opium back in Jim Crow
Okie doke, smokie smoke
And she need that dopie dope, just to cope
But they'd rather see her in those orange clothes

They surround your house
They caught you while you were knocked, down for the count
And now they coming for ya, make sure you hide your daughter
Her skin is light, her eyes are bluer plus her hair is blonder
They known for killing those children, and they'll just get acquitted
Claiming the girl is armed, though they know damn well she isn't
That's why some girls are picking up the heat
And that leads to all the white-on-white crime flooding the streets
Suddenly there's a

“Columbia Police search warrant!

“Kick it open”
They kick in the door, knocking over your golf clubs
Poppin' your dog up in the mug, spilling your Napa Valley
Wine all over all your Persian rugs, now her blood is boiling
They rush her while she flushing all her drugs down the toilet

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,

Spittin' like I don't care
My hair look like I ain't come it, shit a damn near year
So I burn, zig-zag, I leave the next man with his heels up
Brain dead, and be reincarnated at a speed bump
When we done we stay hard, so you don't land shit
Suck Skam's dick, off of what a dead man spit
Yo that's it, I don't plan shit, you know how we go down
They need to slow down, and take a look who the hoe now
At every industry party, gettin' so damn drunk
Can't remember the lass ass you kissed, or dick you sucked
Remind me of my ex, in the street got me veck
Tryin' to roll up on Miami, leavin' with a broke neck
Oh shit, lethal lyric equal land mind
I be stackin' up white rappers like im throwin' gas signs
And I'm, buck wild exposi''n the plain truth
You couldn't mess with me, fuckin' shit up in the same room
Hey you, I don't know you but fuck it, let me get a dollar

You know you're spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your puke is turnin' to yellowish-orange mucus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genius, too extreme for the weak and squeamish
Burn you alive till you screamin' to be extinguished
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 burstin'
You gettin' spun backwards like every word of obscene cursin
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stoppin your short life while you're still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergancy surgery
To try to stop the blood from your ruptured sternum iternally
I'll take it back before we knew each other's name
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mothers frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to Lovers' lane, to the night you were thought of, and
Cock-block your father's game
I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout
I'ma throw a head-butt so hard, I'll knock us both out

Even when I'm feelin' blue 
That I will never ever quit loving you

And crazy times like these (oh woa woa woa)
There's nothing like your love to put my soul at ease
Cause every time you choose to come around
This whole world seems to slow on down

I feel about you
anymore. Mm hm.
I can't hold the hurt inside,
keep the pain out of my eyes
anymore. Mm hm.

My tears no longer waiting.
My resistance ain't that strong.
My mind keeps recreating
a love with you alone
And I'm tired of pretending
I don't love you anymore.

Let me make one last appeal
to show you how I feel
about you.  Mm hm.
'Cause there's no one else I swear
holds a candle anywhere
next to you.  Mm hm

My heart can't take the beating
not having you to hold.
A small voice keeps repeating
deep inside my soul.
It says I can't keep pretending
I don't love you anymore.

I've got to take the chance
or let it pass by
if I expect to get on with my life.

My tears no longer waiting.
Oh my resistance ain't that strong.
Oh my mind keeps recreating
a love with you alone.
And I'm tired of pretending
I don't love you anymore.

Home from work down 31, past Franklin High
She can see the stadium lights, she can hear the band
A thousand crazy high school kids screamin' in the stands
Quarterback and homeoming queen
Love too young to know what it means
She goes back in time, oh in her mind, it's like a dream.

The son she never knew
It hurt so much to give him up
But what else could she do
He would be sixteen

A child should have a home, she knows her folks were right
She never heard the couple's name, just that they were nice
She wonders if he's taller than his father was
Does he drive a car by now, has he been in love
She shakes back to reality 
She knows things turn out the way they should be
But she just can't help but ask herself 
?Does he know about me'?

Sundays haven't been the same
There's not much to explain
I miss the sugarcane
I miss your love

The subway's such a lonely place
I keep looking for your face
The passengers can see my pain
'Cause you're not here

I remember all the good reasons
I had when I was leaving
Now they don't make no sense at all

Call me when the night is cold
Like the summer sun in the snow
I'll warm you like Mexico
Drive until you find me here
We'll have pillow fights, movie nights
A fire just for you, inside

Hide in my kaleidoscope tonight

I wear your sweaters into bed
I end the book you read
I think I'll read it once again
The chapter never ends

I got a nice room with a view
It's waiting just for you
I hope that you've been waiting too
Don't let go

I remember all the good reasons
I had when I was leaving
Now they don't make no sense at all

Call me when the night is cold
Like the summer sun in the snow
I'll warm you like Mexico
Drive until you find me here
We'll have pillow fights, movie nights
A fire just for you, inside

Hide in my kaleidoscope tonight

And all of the colors
That I'm seein' spin around are you
And all of the colors
That I'm seein' all around are you

Call me when the night is cold

Jill Holly,"I need a sign to let me know you're here
All of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere
I need to know that things are gonna look up
'Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup

When there is no place safe and no safe place to put my head
When you feel the world shake from the words that are said

I need a sign to let me know you're here
'Cause my TV set just keeps it all from being clear
I want a reason for the way things have to be
I need a hand to help build up some kind of hope inside of me

And I'm calling all angels
I'm calling all you angels

When children have to play inside so they don't disappear
And private eyes solve marriage lies cause we don't talk for years
And football teams are kissing Queens
And losing sight of having dreams
In a world that what we want is only what we want until it's ours

I'm calling all you angels",Calling All Angels

So all the words you heard were bouncing, bouncing off of you
And all the lines drawn in to save you were just getting in the way of love
And did you ever believe what we were saying? And can I blame you?
'Cause how transparent was I, were you looking at me?

Katie-Lynn, you've always had those dancing gypsy eyes
And a spirit that longed to try its wings
Petite ouseau, you flew into a clouded sky
How could you see your good intentions wouldn't get you by

But you could rise upon the wings of the eagles
If you would only choose to leave the empty way you live
And could you see, could you see, you don't have to prove yourself to me
Let it go, let your pain finally slide off your back down at His feet

'Cause all the love he shows is just bouncing
And all the hands we're reaching out are just getting in the way
And if it's gonna take more to hold you, to show you're loved in spite of you
How transparent am I when you're looking at me?

So you can see I know you've chosen your own way
And it's hard but it's the road you've traveled on
And I pray my life more than these words
Will clearly say that Jesus loves you, He's loved you all along

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Oh, gently lay your head upon my chest
And I will comfort you like a mother while you rest",I Am
Jill Phillips,"What can be said for what's in your head 
Where do your thoughts meet with your actions 
Don't tell me lies or give me advice 
About what to do with my life 
I know where you are, you're not very far 
From the edge of a point where you can't turn back 
And all that you see, all you believe
Is how you can meet all your needs 

[Chorus]
Is this what you wanted from your life 
Or would you say your expectations have changed 
It's a sure sign of a wrong turn 
But then you don't pay attention anymore (anyway) 

Spiraling down you plunge to the ground 
Waited by all the baggage you are holding 
Clutching it tight with all of your might 
You don't even realize that you are falling 
Gone is the glow we all used to know 
Your eyes seem to focus on a point beyond me 
The words are rehearsed and neatly versed 
To dutifully further your facade 

[Chorus]

What can I say to make you listen 
The words are flying through your ears and out your head 
It's wasting time and wasting breath 
Cause ""I'll do what I want"" you once said 
And you'll do what you want like you said 

So show me the place, the very first trace 
Of love in your life- as you now call it 
You would have been ashamed but you've changed your name 
And I guess you've changed your mind 
I guess you've changed your mind 

Oh, you've changed, you've changed",Is This What You Wanted
Jill Phillips,"I don't see why I don't see what bothers me 
And I don't know why I don't know what won't let me go 
I should have listened to myself when I had it down 
This dose of my own medicine is too big to swallow now 
This is the time when I find what's inside of me 
This is the time when I decide what I believe 

[Chorus]
If I want to be real in this world 
The I have to realize 
If I am going to live by the sword 
I'm gonna have to die by the sword 

It's easy to be calm when there's no crashing tide 
It's easy to be quiet when it's loud outside 
It's easy to be humble when you're glorified 
But now I'm out here on my own and screaming from inside 

This is the time when I find what's inside of me 
This is the time when I decide what I believe 

[Chorus]

You stripped me down to basics 
You left my heart exposed 
There is no pride in times like this 
No one said it was easy 
No one said it was fair 
But nobody's happy when it is 

Lord, I need your loving arms to carry me 
When I look in the mirror and don't like what I see 
I know you know what I desire to do 
So help me follow even when it's not easy to 

[Chorus]",Live by the Sword
Jill Phillips,"You are the only road that leads me home
But I only take you when I'm lost
You are the only one who loves me in my weaknesses
But I only love you when I'm strong

You are the only water giving life
But I only drink you when I thirst
Now that iv taken all these things for granted all this time
You'd think I get what I deserve

But you cared so much for me 
That you gave your only son
And you'd do it all again
If I was the only one

I know I don't deserve your love for me
And I know its something I can't earn
You are the only one whose love does not depend upon
What I give you in return

But you cared so much for me 
That you gave your only son
And you'd do it all again
If I was the only one

You alone created every star in every galaxy
You also made these lines upon my hands
How could someone so great have such deep concern for only me

You, oh you
You'd do it all again
If I was the only one

But you cared so much for me 
That you gave your only son
And you'd do it all again
If I was the only one",Only One
Jill Phillips,"So this is how it feels at the rock bottom of despair 
When the house I built comes crashing down 
And this is how it feels when I know the man that I say I am 
Is not the man that I am when no one's around 
This is how it feels to come alive again 
And start fighting back to gain control 
And this is how it feels to let freedom in 
And break these chains that enslave my soul 

[Chorus]
I refuse to be locked up in here like a prison cell 
Where all I ever get is a meal and four walls 
I used to be just fine in here but not anymore 
Gonna break through these steel bars 

So tell me how it feels when the tables start to turn 
And you find yourself at the losing end 
Tell me how it feels, you're not welcome here 
'Cause I'm tired of pain and I'm tired of sin 

[Chorus]

I won't let you win 
I have no doubt 
I don't want you in 
So get out, get out 

[Chorus]

I refuse to be locked up in here like a prison cell 
Where all I ever get is a meal and four walls 
I used to be just fine in here but not anymore 
Gonna break through these steel bars",Steel Bars
Jill Phillips,"Well you came just like they said you would 
Like you always have from what I've seen and heard 
And you took our dreams and future plans 
Crushed them all like grains of sand 

Even still, even still 
You have no power, you never will 
And even still, even still 
You have no power and you never will 

Easy to say, but it's hard to live 
When life itself is near the end 
Because that fear resides in every soul 
When it shows its face, it's good to know 

So when the hourglass is empty 
And there's knocking at my door 
I don't want my fear to grip me 
So I'll sing this 'till I'm sure",Even Still
Jill Phillips,"When you start to doubt if you exist 
God believes in you 
Confounded by the evidence 
God believes in you 

When your light burns so dim 
When your chances seem so slim 
And you swear you don't believe in Him 

God believes in you 
When you rise up just to fall again 
God believes in you 
Deserted by your closest friends 
God believes in you 

When you're betrayed with a kiss 
And you turn your cheek to another fist 
It doesn't have to end like this 
God believes in you 

Everything matters if anything matters at all 
Everything matters no matter how big 
No matter how small 
God believes in you 

Oh God believes in you 
When you're so ashamed that you could die 
God believes in you 
And you can't to right even though you try 
God believes in you 

Blessed are the ones who grieve 
The ones who mourn and the ones who bleed 
In sorrow you sow but in joy you'll reap 
God believes in you 

Oh blessed are the ones who grieve 
The ones who mourn and the ones who grieve 
In sorrow you sow but in joy you'll reap 
God believes in you 
Oh God believes in you",God Believes in You
Jill Phillips,"All the weary, tired souls full of hunger 
Needing something that fills 
All the thirsty that heard about living water 

Need a way to the well 
It's a strange crowd 
But still somehow 
The lost have been found 
By the One in whose Name we come 

Grace and peace to you through our Lord Jesus 
Times like these we need that kind of love 
To take these things coming in between us 
And wash us clean with the body and the blood 
Early that night just before he was taken 

He broke of the bread 
So we could taste that He has died, He is risen 
He is coming again 
And it's much more 
Than we could ask for 
To be made pure 
By the One in whose Name we come",Grace and Peace
Jill Phillips,"I knew it all along that this day was coming 
Even though I knew it doesn't hurt any less 
But somehow the suffering draws me to You 
I could start running in anger 
But then what's the point of a Savior 

I feel the pain but it still doesn't change who You are 
Nothing I feel is outside of the reach of Your arms 
My whole world could crumble but all of the pieces remain 
In Your hands that are waiting to put them together again 

Just like I know You will in Your own time, in Your own wisdom 
One day I'll look back and see the grand design 
Maybe it will make sense then, these questions I have 

But with it all here front and center 
Sometimes it's hard to remember 
I could start running in anger 
But then what's the point of a Savior",Grand Design
Jill Phillips,"The weight I fastened on trying to make my world run 
Almost pinned me to the floor 

I could not orchestrate one solitary day 
And the more I worked I found my efforts all in vain 
I believe that I need to let go of these things 

To be free 
So help me stop this hanging on 
All my worry got was more of what I did not want 
A love of power and control 

Every hour running kept me in my starting place 
When I finally rested I began to win this race 
There is only so much I can do with these two hands 
Precious is the freedom when I finally understand 
That I need to let go of these things",Hanging On
Jill Phillips,"I've got so much on my mind
I have to get it off my chest
Have to open up my mouth and speak the truth
I let the little words out right
But leave the biggest stone unturned
It's like I'm trying to keep the light from taking root

But I'm never gonna' clean this slate
At the rate I'm going
Have to dig in to find the strength
To follow through
I've shown forgiving myself is something I can't do
So I'll leave it up, leave it up to you
I'll leave it up to you

'Cause if it were up to me
To pull myself out of this place
A failure's what I'd be without your grace

'Cause it's never gonna' wash me clean
This muddy water
Your river is the only thing
To make me new
I've shown forgiving myself is something I can't do
So I'll leave it up, leave it up to you
I'll leave it up to you 

The God of a million second chances
'Cause the chances are
That I'll return and take the wheel
A million times or more",Leave It Up to You
Jill Phillips,"It's the cliched writing on the wall 
Funny how it's been there all along 
And all the while you've listened to 
Anyone who had a point of view on what you should do 

The liars in your head are growing loud 
They say you're in too deep to turn back now 
And answers seem so hard to find 
You wonder if you still can change your mind change your mind 

There's something to be said for patience 
So hold on to what you know is sacred 
Don't let your only dream be taken 
And cashed in for everything you've hated 

You have something there that can't be sold 
A lifetime full of secrets to be told 
And it is not too late to choose 
The narrow winding way that few men do so few men do",Sacred
Jill Phillips,"When the storm clouds dark and gray threaten to rain 
Still is my soul, 
Still is my soul 
When the waves come crashing in to wash me away 
Still is my soul, 
Still is my soul 
When the winter wind starts blowing in 

Freezing over every stream 
There's a peace that passes understanding 
Flowing like a current beneath 
Still is my soul, 
Still is my soul, 
Still is my soul 
Even when the whole world turns against me 
And there's nowhere to hide 

Still is my soul, 
Still is my soul 
I know the greatest treasures aren't found in this life 
Still is my soul, 
Still is my soul 
When the trials of this world rise against me 
I will face them all unafraid 
There's a peace that passes understanding 
Coursing through the blood in my veins 
Still is my soul, 
Still is my soul, 
Still is my soul 

When these lungs take in their last breath it won't be goodbye 
Still is my soul, Still is my soul 
Though my time on earth is over my love is alive

Jill Phillips,"The water rose above my head 
The next thing I remember I was carried down the stream 
Left me washed up on that shore 
But the power of the flood still burned inside of me 

It's the way of the fire 
It's the way of the fire 
I took the first step without fear 
I didn't see the danger of what the stream could do 

Then I felt the undertow 
Of all the things I asked for coming true 
It's the way of the fire 
(Just one step into the flame) 
It's the way of the fire 
(He starts consuming everything) 
And it's all gonna' burn 
(I'm refined and strengthened by) 
The way of the fire 

I don't know how long I have been 
Lying in the stillness staring up at blue 
But I hear the voice within 

Say ""Come back in the water"", and I do 
And the river's rise is a scary thing 
But it always runs downstream 
The way of the fire",The Way of the Fire
Jill Phillips,"Humble yourself before the Almighty 
That's where you find true wisdom 
Make it your first step, make it your last thought 
Lying in bed when the day's done 

Hear it calling out your name 
In the busy streets in the center of town 
Who will turn their face to truth and then live it out 

Wisdom is greater than any fleeting 
Pleasure that money brings you 
Answers will come to those who pursue 
The pathway to life that few choose 

Hear it calling out your name 
In the busy streets in the center of town 
Who will turn their face to truth and then live it out 

Knowledge awaits you filling your arms 
With more than they ever could grasp 
Blessed are you who hunger for truth 
And keep your eyes fixed on what lasts 

Hear it calling out your name 
In the busy streets in the center of town 
Who will turn their face to truth and then live it out",Wisdom
Jill Phillips,"Just when my tears were falling deep enough to drown
Down in the valley of the shadow of a doubt
When I gave up that's when 
He came to lift me out and set me high

When I saw it as a gift of matchless worth
I started thinking it was something I deserved
He pulled the rug from underneath 
Without a word and left me dry

Piece together these little mysteries
It isn't hard to see the writing on the wall
Triumph and tragedy, only God can be
Both the builder and the wrecking ball

He gave them freedom and a fertile promise land
They took for granted their deliverance at hand
Thirty-nine years later 
They're still walking through that sand

Wondering why
And He builds it up
And He knocks it down
Just to build it up even stronger",Wrecking Ball

Mmm, this morning my man exclusively introduced me 
To some good extra loving 
He was licking, and sucking on everything, just the way he should 
This morning's extra loving was good 
We lay there sweaty, sex funky, happy as we want to be 
Loving exclusively, my man and me all night all morning 
So our stomachs were growling, hungrily 
So I jumped up and rushed to the store 
In hopes of coming back and getting a little more of 
This morning's good extra loving

At the market the people were pushing and shoving 
Trying to be the next in line, the turn was mine 
The new girl at the counter was cute, but not as fine as me 
Was this some kind of woman's intuition, some kind of insecurity 
Nah, 'cause my man is happy at home loving me exclusively 
So I shook my head, ""whats up?""
""Hello,""she smiled as she rung me up 

Orange juice $3.29, Croissants $4.85

Jill Scott,"Love rain down on me, on me, down on me
Love rain down on me, on me, down on me
Love rain down on me, on me, down on me
Love rain down on me, on me, down on me

Met him on a Thursday, sunny afternoon
Cumulus clouds, eighty-four degrees
He was brown, deep
Said he wanted to talk about my mission
Listen to my past lives (Word?)
Took me on long walks to places where butterflies rest easy
Talked about Moses and Mumia
Reparations, blue colors, memories of shell-topped Adidas

He was fresh like summer peaches
Sweet on my mind like block parties and penny candy
Us was nice and warm, no jacket, no umbrella, just warm
At night we would watch the stars
And he would physically give me each and every one
I felt like cayenne pepper, red, hot, spicy
I felt dizzy and so near the heavens and miles between my thighs
Better than love, we made delicious
He me had, had me he
He had me tongue-tied
I could hear his rhythm in my thoughts
I was his sharp, his horn section
His boom and his bip
And he was my love

Love rain down on me, on me, down on me

The rain was fallin' and, and slowly and sweetly and stinging my eyes
And I could not see that he became my voodoo priest
And I was his faithful concubine
Wide open, wide, loose like bowels after collard greens
The mistake was made
Love slipped from my lips
Dripped down my chin and landed in his lap
And us became new
Now me non-clairvoyant and in love
Made the coochie easy and the obvious, invisible

The rain was falling
And I couldn't see the season changing
And the vibe slipping off its axis
Our beautiful melody became wildly staccato
The rain was falling and I could not see
That I was to be plowed and sowed and fertilized
And left to drown in his sunny afternoon
Cumulus clouds, eighty-four degrees, melody

Love rain down on me, on me, down on me
Love rain down on me, on me, down on me

Wide open, wide loose
The mistake was made
Love slipped from my lips, my chin, and landed in his lap
And us became new, me non clairvoyant and in love me
Me the fool
You were never true
If you didn't want me, ah, you should have let me know
All you was make a mockery of something so incredible and beautiful
I honestly in love

Love rain down on me, on me, down on me",Love Rain

If you want it to happen baby
Hold fast and believe
You can make it happen baby

Then try once again
Then try a few more times
Then try after then

When I was a little girl
Raised on N. Philly streets
I'd hear my people say
Ghetto's all they'd be
But my mommy would hold me
Quietly give me peace
She'd look me in my eyes and she'd say to me

As a teenager I dreamed to see the world
But how could I do this me a poor black girl
And just when my will was lost
And all hope seemed set free
I'd remember my mama's face and her tellin' me

Try try try
Try try try
Try try try
Try and try again [repeat]

Now as a grown woman I still stumble and fall
But wit a lot of faith and the same amount of effort
I can withstand it all

How and where and with whom I make my money

But is he nice for you

He's a High Post Brotha
With money in his pocket
He got every-thing a girl could want
Think maybe he don't

Wit money in his pocket
He got everything a girl could want

Some sistas want tha balla

Dumbfounded by out the ghetto conversations
His mentality's oh so so small
Get the cream
Get the hoes
Get the cars
He wants to go far
But how far is too far

Come here love (chickka) love 
Let me holla at you

But you my girl 
And I can tell that its bothering you
This motherahh must think that he a father to you
You got vision but boys blockin the view
I know he payin yo tuition
Payin to get the car fixin
He got Juice or is he Pulp Fiction
Heard he be strip clubs
Flippin duhs like he got big buhs
Is it his image
Or him that you in love with
You on some shit but you was never superficial

When rent's due is trip what a chick do
You don't like his mind
The way he looks 
And you said that his breath stinks
But all of that added up 
Doesn't equal a fresh mink

Jill Scott,"Love rain down on me, on me, down on me

Met him on a Thursday, sunny afternoon
Cumulus clouds, 84 degrees
He was brown, deep
Said he wanted to talk about my mission
Listen to my past lives (Word?)
Took me on long walks to places where butterflies rest easy
Talked about Moses and Mumia
Reparations, blue colors, memories of shell top adidas
He was fresh, like summer peaches
Sweet on my mind like block parties and penny candy
Us was nice and warm, no jacket, no umbrella, just warm
At night we would watch the stars
And he would physically give me each and every one
I felt like cayenne pepper, red, hot, spicy
I felt Dizzy and Sonia, heaven and Miles between my
Thighs
Better than love, we made delicious
He me had, had me he
He had me tongue tied
I could hear his rhythm in my thoughts
I was his sharp, his horn section
His boom and his bop
And he was my love

Love rain down on me, on me, down on me

The rain was fallin and,and slowly and sweetly and stinging 
My
Eyes
And I could not see that he became my voodoo priest
And I was his faithful concubine
Wide open, wide, loose like bowels after collard greens
The mistake was made
Love slipped from my lips
Dripped down my chin and landed in his lap
And us became new
Now me non-clairvoyant and in love
Made the coochie easy and the obvious invisible
The rain was falling
And I couldn't see the season changing
And the vibe slipping off its axis
Our beautiful melody became wildly staccato
The rain was falling and I could not see
That I was to be plowed and sowed and fertilized
And left to drown in his sunny afternoon
Cumulus clouds, 84 degrees, melody

Love rain down on me, on me, down on me (2x)

Wide open wide loose
The mistake was made
Love slipped from my lips
Dripped down my chin and 
Landed in his lap
And us became new
Me not clairvoyant and in love 
Made me the fool
You were never true
If you didn't want me
Ah you should have let me know
All you did was make a mockery of 
Of something so incredible, beautiful

I honestly did love you so.....

Love rain down on me, on me, down on me

(Mos Def:)

I stretch my arms towards the sky like blades of tall grass,
The sun beat between my shoulders like carnival drums.
I sat still and hoped it would help my wings grow
So then I could really be fly.
And then she arrived.
Like daybreak inside a railway tunnel,
Like the new moon,
Like a diamond in the mines,
Like high noon to a junker,
Sudden...
She made my heart beat in the now, now time signature,
Her skin a canvas for ultra violet brush strokes.
She was the sun's painting,
She was a deep cognac color,
Her eyes fall for that lights along the new city,
Her lips purse as if her breath was too sweet and full for her mouth to hold.
I said:
""You are the beautiful distress of mathematics,""
I said:
""For you, I will peal open the clouds like new fruit,
And give you lightning and thunder as a dowry,
I will make the sky shed all of its stars like rain,
And I will cast the constellations across your waste,
And I will make the heavens your keep.
And they will be pleased to cover you,
They will be pleased to cover you,
May I please... cover you...

...please...",Love Rain (Suite)

Run the extra mile

Baby I'm getting so frustrated 
Aggravated
Because it seems that you're hiding something from me 
And that ain't the way I swing
I'm loving you 
But I get confused 
And what makes me fear
When your personality is unclear
I make things up in my mind
You're right next to me
But sometimes I feel like you walk away
And you just don't have a thing to say
But I fear for you

Jill Scott,"You pulled some tricks out your sleeve last night
Everything I fantasize about
You had me climbing up a wall
How many ways was God called

You represented in the fashion of the truly gifted
You put it down last night
Knocked me out then had me dreaming 'bout waking up, alright
Do you want some money baby

How about some chicken wings
Do you want some fish and grits
I'll hurry and go get it
Whatever

We made a groove last night
A poignant rocking forth and back alright
Anything I can do for you
Just ask sometimes you won't have to

I'll be happy just to make you happy
And that's true
Oh
We made powerful

Love last night
Never knew passion could taste so sweet alright
I made a vow to you
Everything I do for you is a joy and a gift
You got my whole life lifted",Whatever
Jill Scott,"I can pay my own light bill, baby
Put my own gas in my own car
I can buy my own shoe collection
I've been blessed thus far

I can kill the spider above my bed
Although it's hard because I'm scared
I can even stain and poly your bane
But some things just don't change

I need you, yeah
Sometimes so hard to say, uh
I need you
Some things remain

I can buy my own groceries, baby
Get my hair dyed, my nails fly
I can floss my own bling-bling
Write the words to the songs I sing

I can even raise a child well-made
Make sure he's loved and knows what God gave, uh huh
I can teach him how to walk and stand
But he needs you to help him be a man

Umm

We need you
So hard to say
We need you
Some things don't change

I can be a Congress woman or a garbage woman
A police officer or a carpenter
I can be doctor and a lawyer and a mother and a good goddess
Woman, what you done to me?
Good lover I can be
I can be a computer on a list
The queen with the nappy hair raising the fist
Or 
I can be much more and a myriad of this
Hot as the summer
Sweet as the first kiss

And even though I can do all these things
I need you
And even though I can do all these things
We need you
We need you, we need you
And even though I can do all these things by my damn self
I need you
I do, I do, I do, I do
And though I can do all these here things
I need you, we need you
I do",The Fact Is (I Need You) [Live in Paris]
Jill Scott,"[Chorus]
The little rain drops fallin' down on me
But I can't seem to feel it, feel it
Feel it coming over me

The rain gon' come through the window; pain will come
Black, white, rich, poor; it's the same old drum
Rainy days like the war, use wisdom as a weapon
Hold your head up, dry your clothes and keep steppin'
Let the children feel the rain, 'cause if they feel the rain
From the wetness, they stand to gain
I came into the game; it felt like the middle of June
Music was warm; artists, like flowers: they bloom
Then boom; I shook the room, many felt the thunder
My time to shine; did it like summer
I wondered if the sun would shine forever
Pops said, 'rain gon' come.' to him I said, 'never'
Cheddar in the genes, face on screens
Got a benz wit' the sheen, but what did it all mean?
I earned money and burned money, credit cards smokin'
Platinum, Grammys, famous, but still broke and
Not having cash put me in check
Yo, the road to the riches is slippery when wet
Amongst the fall is where you truly find yourself
Ever since then, the rain I never felt
Deal wit' it

[Chorus]

At age seventeen, the worst pain: a hurricane
Her first name still conjures the rain
Vowed to never let nobody ever get me wet
Lest we forget, love is a four season concept
Many say the rain they can't stand
Never let the weather determine the man
God has a plan; from it I never ran
Follow my heart through the storm, my umbrella in hand
I'm Noah, life's my arc
Forty days and forty nights; still can't take my heart
Seen the fallen man
To dope and liquor brands
The devil'll dance to make it rain
Bringing the pain
Walk through the puddles of struggle on flooded streets
Soakin' wet, but mastered the art of peace
Through grey skies I grew wise, on bended knees I knelt
Since then, the rain I never felt 
What's wit' it?

[Chorus]

Sometimes I sit in my room, stuff on my mind
Stress, can't rest, so I open the blinds
See kids in the streets, runnin' around
It wasn't touchin' 'em, but the rain was comin' down
I wondered how, with my mouth wide
Reminisce of the key, said I want to go outside
In the rain, to see if the same would happen to me
'Bout that time God started rappin' to me
He said, 'pain is the mother of change, the rain must flow 
So the seeds of joy might grow
Don't be afraid, find shelter in me
The road to greatness through the valley of adversity.'
I felt the light as He proceeded to drop the gem
These little children; the world we must receive like them
I just smiled, and thanked Him for the cards He dealt
And since then, the rain I never felt
What's wit' it?

Would it even matter, you'd still be mad at me
If I could find in all this a dozen roses
Which I would give to you, you'd still be miserable

Watching as he took the holder off his shoulder
Fire in his eyes,hands getting bolder
Quiet,quiet
Growing excited
Dug him for his bank account,but really for
his private
Damn about a mindset
Really wasn't into that
Needed me some pleasing,jon looking real fat
Laidback was his foreplay
All that was needed,needed was some of that
Started simple
Massaging on my temple
Pinching on my mountain peaks
That a sisters into
I responded,'Mmmmm.'
You like the sound,I like makin'it more
I fell for the rock and shore
Enough,he brought it close so I could really see
Up close he slid between my breast
Sweaty with lust and sweat

Rode Mt.Saint Scott 'til ooooo
Creamy lava landed on my skin and neck
Blended with my all day Chanel scent
This freaking was incredulent,decadent
Flip side,stomach meets sheets
He plows inside as if he's making beats
As if this year's harvest depended on it
Bendin'on it
Back on my back old fashioned is renewed
Red toenail polish on whitewalls
Documenting this freaking,ahhhhh
I must'

Moving with my back and my hips
Like my ancestors did

I've been talking to this man
He's been saying what I like and
He makes me smile,
When I'm down,so down

He says sweet things in my ear
All the things that I needed to hear
But that's as far as it's gone
I promise,I promise

But I enjoy it,I love it so
Cause it seems like I'm always alone
You're at arms reach
But baby,
Where are you?
Where are you?
Cause I got this fire
Sweet and true
But I'm cold as ice around you

Cause I'm lonely
Whenever you're around
Cause I'm lonely

we had
It seems like you're missing in action

And I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun for another overload
I hear you singin' in the wire
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line

I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line",Imagination/Crown Royal Suite [*]

It just flows and flows
Pull it from my left side,right brain
Grab it from my neck,my toes
I feel the music sink into me
Go through me,move me,move me
It's a pleasure to be live and thinkin'
It's a pleasure to be in this zone

[Chorus:]
I just let it go
Don't stop this feeling
Chop this feeling
I just let it go
Don't stop this feeling
Chop,chop,no

When I sing the rightness,tightness
It just goes and goes
Pull it from my people's legacy
Way down in my soul
I let the spirit move right to me
Come through me,move me,whoa

Of day to day sorrow and pain

And helps me breathe again

Again, I'm scared again (1, 2)
Oh oh oh

You got that ocean of soul
Baby you super thick
And I'm the man of steel with skills
Call me Super Dick
I got that technique that keeps you comin' back to back
And I know you feel it all in your stomach whenever you arch your back
I'm a pull yo hair; I know you love that
When I maneuver this tongue, your eyes roll back
I work them side angles; I'm a Kama Sutra pro
Kitchen table down to the flo
Ass in the air while you biting that pillow
Girl you know how I chop and screw
That's what a diamond chip dick do

Why does my body ignore what my mind says?

It was fun.
I had stars in my eyes.
Oh my God, he was witty and sweet,
Relaxed and comfortable.
Conversation was nice and easy,
Steady moving, (sense of humor), smart.
There was a kind of dignitary vibe
Like an original hip hop melody break dance, if that makes sense, Soul Train.

Deceptively hiding, waiting to spill his venom on my ass.
He could be cold blooded
With another woman behind another door
Another couple of kids, three or four
He could be lying about his money
Ain't got nothing to show
He could be be a lotta things, a lotta things

I gotta keep moving

Can't stop thinking, reminiscing.
Can't stop. Can't let go.
Ohh ohhh

But when I wake up,
And one day I will do it,
I have let you go
And everything I went through was beautiful
I have let you go
And everything I went through was beautiful

Maybe I, right now, can't see the forest for the trees
So lost behind hurt
But I'm trying everyday exponentially
To move forward
Do you know how it feels to be lost?

She wanted the life that only money could bring

Would do anything, to get that life
Didn't talk down to her, didn't make her cry

Want me to be what they want me to be

And put some funk in the kitchen

You make me feel like I'm here
Not lost in the atmosphere, somewhere, boy

I adore you
Completely, so deeply
It's true, boy
I adore you
So sweetly baby, you know that it's true

And all I want to do is give my life to you
And share the things that make us happy
And all I ever dreamed of is coming true
Oh, it's you",I Adore You [Vault Recording] [#] [#]
Jill Scott,"Pieces of me were scattered
Blowing in the cold
In different directions, hm
Truth, truth, truth be told
But then I looked into your eyes
Everything felt like it could be alright
You went and put me back together
Back together again

Going through heartache, aw
You know I think I lost my mind for a time
And couldn't get better
Couldn't get no better
No matter, no matter how hard I tried
Then I, I looked into your eyes
And everything felt like it could be alright
You went and put me back together
You went and put me back together
Back together again

Somebody sang

Put me back together again
Somebody sing, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey yeah
Put me back together again
Surely did oh

Now I'm walking in my sunshine
And everything feels so right
You went and put me right back together
Put me right back together
Baby look at what you did
Oh, eh
You did it
Back together again
Back together again
Back together oo, again

And I feel like I'm walking on air, baby
Thank you",Back Together
Jill Scott,"Fireflies are lighting up the night air
Our dance to a new moon's tune
The scent of your cologne, won't leave me alone
Eight phases to a lunar cycle
This is the time, this is the night to

Make beautiful love
Beautiful love, mmm
Couldn't be more perfect if we planned it
Hand in hand we walk, so romantic

Aw baby, there's no place I'd rather be
Than your chocolate covered coated honey d
And baby, making love, just ain't making love to me, no

Couldn't be more perfect if we planned it
Wouldn't change a thing, this is magic

Make beautiful love
(Make beautiful) beautiful love
Baby, I just love your beautiful
Couldn't be more perfect if we planned it
Wouldn't change a thing (this is magic)

Tonight I feel the glow
Two universes under one love, feels so spiritual
What you are to me is all time
Oh, and we both know

Couldn't be more perfect if we planned it
Wouldn't change a thing (this is magic)
(Magic)
Baby, I just love your beautiful
Couldn't be more perfect if we planned it
Wouldn't change a thing (this is magic)

Tonight I feel the glow
Make beautiful love
Feels so spiritual
Oh and we both know
Couldn't be more perfect (perfect, perfect)
Perfact",Beautiful Love
