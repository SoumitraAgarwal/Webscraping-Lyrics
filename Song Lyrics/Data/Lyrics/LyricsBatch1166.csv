Silvio Rodríguez,"A veces siento deseos de amor 
Y a menudo no puedo beber 
Para esa hora busque una canción 
Con la que me entretengo la sed 

Tiene delirios de la tradición 
Y otras hierbas que suelo rumiar 
Ya te las voy a cantar

Yo soy como soy 
Y a casi todo el mundo le pedí prestado 
Yo soy como soy 
Y a casi todo el mundo yo le tiendo mano 
Y a casi todo el mundo yo le tiendo mano 
Y a casi todo el mundo yo le tiendo 

Dime que pena te puedo sanar 
Yo quisiera también ser doctor 
Solo deseo que para tu mal 
Tenga alivio mi vieja canción 
Lo que te doy de mortal a mortal 
Se desprende gustoso de mi 
El resto espera por ti 

Yo soy como soy

Se que hay amores que no curara 
Ni la mas esmerada canción 
En todo caso te invito a llenar 
De optimismo este buen corazón 
Vale la pena dejar de llorar 
Y hacer cita con el porvenir 
Vale la pena vivir 

Yo soy como soy",Yo Soy Como Soy
Silvio Rodríguez,"Yo te quiero libre, libre y con amor
Libre de la sombra, pero no del sol
Yo te quiero libre, como te viví
Libre de otras penas, y libre de mi

La libertad tiene alma clara
Y solo canta cuando va batiendo alas
Vuela y canta, libertad
La libertad nació sin dueño
Y yo quien soy para robarle cada sueno

Yo te quiero libre y con buena fe
Para que conduzcas tu preciosa sed
Yo te quiero libre, libre de verdad
Libre como el sueno de la libertad

La libertad, nació sin dueño
Y yo quien soy para robarle cada sueno

Yo te quiero libre como te viví
Libre de otras penas, y libre de mi",Yo Te Quiero Libre
Silvio Rodríguez,"Hoy viene a mí­ 
La damisela soledad 
Con pamela, 
Impertinentes y botón 
De amapola en el oleaje 
De sus vuelos 
Hoy la voluble 
Señorita es amistad 
Y acaricia finalmente 
El corazón,
Con su más delgado 
Pétalo de hielo 

Por eso hoy, 
Gentilmente 
Te convido a pasear 
Por el patio, 
Hasta el florido pabellón 
De aquel árbol 
Que plantaron los abuelos 
Hoy el ensueño es 
Como el musgo en el brocal, 
Dibujando los abismos 
De un amor 
Melancólico, sutil, 
Pálido cielo 

Viene a mí­, avanza, 
Viene tan despacio, 
Viene en una danza 
Leve del espacio 
Cedo, me hago lacio 
Y ya vuelo, ave 
Se mece la nave 
Lenta, como el tul 
En la brisa suave, 
Niña del azul 

Oh melancolí­a, 
Novia silenciosa, 
Í­ntima pareja del ayer; 
Oh melancolí­a, 
Amante dichosa, 
Siempre me arrebata 
Tu placer; 
Oh melancolí­a, 
Señora del tiempo, 
Beso que retorna 
Como el mar; 
Oh melancolí­a, 
Rosa del aliento, 
Dime quién me puede amar

Silvio Rodríguez,"Si te dijera, amor mío, 
Que temoa a la madrugada, 
No sé qué estrellas son estas 
Que hieren como amenazas, 
Ni sé qué sangra la luna 
Al filo de su guadaña. 
Presiento que tras la noche 
Vendrá la noche más larga, 
Quiero que no me abandones 
Amor mío, al alba. 
Los hijos que no tuvimos 
Se esconden en las cloacas, 
Comen las últimas flores, 
Parece que adivinaran 
Que el día que se avecina 
Viene con hambre atrasada. 
Presiento que tras la noche

Miles de buitres callados 
Van extendiendo sus alas, 
No te destroza, amor mío, 
Esta silenciosa danza, 
Maldito baile de muertos, 
Pólvora de la mañana. 
Presiento que tras la noche",Al Alba
Silvio Rodríguez,"Anda, 
quítate el vestido 
las flores y las trampas, 
ponte la desnuda 
violencia que recatas 
y ven a mis brazos, 
dejemos los datos, 
seamos un cuerpo enamorado. 

Anda, 
deja que descubra 
los montes de tu mapa, 
la concupiscencia 
secreta de tu alma 
y ven a mis brazos, 
dejemos los datos, 
seamos un cuerpo enamorado. 

Anda, 
pídeme que viole 
las leyes que te encarnan, 
que no quede intacto 
ni un poro en la batalla, 
y ven a mis brazos, 
dejemos los datos, 
seamos un cuerpo enamorado. 

Anda, 
dime lo que sientes, 
no temas si me mata, 
que yo sólo entiendo 
tus labios como espadas, 
y ven a mis brazos, 
dejemos los datos, 
seamos un cuerpo enamorado",Anda
Silvio Rodríguez,"Enemigo de la guerra
Y su reverso, la medalla
No propuse otra batalla
Que librar al corazón
De ponerse cuerpo a tierra
Bajo el paso de una historia
Que iba a alzar hasta la gloria
El poder de la razón
Y ahora que ya no hay trincheras
El combate es la escalera
Y el que trepe a lo mas alto
Pondrá a salvo su cabeza
Aunque se hunda en el asfalto
La belleza

Míralos, como reptiles
Al acecho de la presa
Negociando en cada mesa
Maquillajes de ocasión
Siguen todos los raíles
Que conduzcan a la cumbre
Locos por que nos deslumbre
Su parásita ambición
Antes iban de profetas
Y ahora el éxito es su meta
Mercaderes, traficantes
Mas que nausea dan tristeza
No rozaron ni un instante
La belleza

Y me hablaron de futuros
Fraternales, solidarios
Donde todo lo falsario
Acabaría en el pilón
Y ahora que se cae el muro
Ya no somos tan iguales
Tanto vendes, tanto vales
¡viva la revolución!
Reivindico el espejismo
De intentar ser uno mismo
Ese viaje hacia la nada
Que consiste en la certeza
De encontrar en tu mirada
La belleza…",La Belleza
Silvio Rodríguez,"Tu sed transubstancia mi sudor 
en vino que bebemos en cada beso 

Tus pies no se hunden 
en los lagos de mis lágrimas. 

Tu saliva siembra la luz 
en la noche de mis ojos. 

Tu voz resucita mis músculos dormidos 
mis latidos sepultados. 

Tus manos, cuando me tocan, curan 
mis heridas más invisibles. 

Tu hambre fecunda peces 
que se multiplican como deseos de humedad 
en el múltiple pan de mi cuerpo. 

cada vez que me amas, 
es un milagro.",Cada Vez Que Me Amas
Silvio Rodríguez,"Fue en ese cine, te acuerdas, 
en una mañana al este del edén, 
James Dean tiraba piedras 
a una casa blanca, entonces te besé. 

Aquella fue la primera 
vez, tus labios parecían de papel, 
y a la salida en la puerta 
nos pidió un triste inspector nuestros carnets. 
Luego volví a la academia 
para no faltar a clases de francés, 
tú me esperaste hora y media 
en esta misma mesa, yo me retrasé. 

Quieres helado de fresa 
o prefieres que te pida ya el café. 
Cuéntame cómo te encuentras 
aunque se que me responderás: muy bien. 
Ten, esta foto es muy fea, 
el más pequeño acababa de nacer 
oiga, me trae la cuenta, 
calla, que fui yo quién te invitó a comer. 
No te demores, no sea 
que no llegues a la hora al almacén. 
Llámame el día que puedas, 
date prisa que ya son las cuatro y diez",Las Cuatro y Diez
Silvio Rodríguez,"De alguna manera 
tendré que olvidarte, 
por mucho que quiera 
no es fácil, ya sabes, 
me faltan las fuerzas, 
ha sido muy tarde, 
y nada más, y nada más, 
apenas nada más. 

Las noches te acercan 
y enredas el aire, 
mis labios se secan 
e intento besarte, 
qué fría es la cera 
de un beso de nadie 
y nada más, y nada más, 
apenas nada más. 

Las horas de piedra 
parecen cansarse 
y el tiempo se peina 
con gesto de amante, 
de alguna manera 
tendré que olvidarte 
y nada más, y nada más, 
apenas nada más.",De Alguna Manera
Silvio Rodríguez,"Si me dijeran pide un deseo
Preferiría un rabo de nube
Un torbellino en el suelo 
Y una gran ira que sube
Un barredor de tristezas
Un aguacero en venganza 
Que cuando escampe parezca 
Nuestra esperanza

Si me dijeran pide un deseo
Preferiría un rabo de nube
Que se llevara lo feo 
Y nos dejara el querube
Un barredor de tristezas
Un aguacero en venganza 
Que cuando escampe parezca 
Nuestra esperanza",Rabo de Nube
Silvio Rodríguez,"Hay algunos que dicen
que todos los caminos conducen a Roma
why es verdad porque el mío
me lleva cada noche al hueco que te nombra
why le hablo why le suelto
una sonrisa, una blasfemia why dos derrotas;
luego apago tus ojos
why duermo con tu nombre besando mi boca.

Ay, amor mío,
qué terriblemente absurdo
es estar vivo
sin el alma de tu cuerpo,
sin tu latido.

Que el final de esta historia,
enésima autobiografía de un fracaso,
no te sirva de ejemplo,
hay quien afirma que el amor es un milagro
que no hay mal que no cure
pero tampoco bien que le dure cien años;
eso casi lo salva,
lo malo son las noches que mojan mi mano.

Aunque todo ya es nada,
no sé por qué te escondes why huyes de mi encuentro.
Por saber de tu vida
no creo que vulnere ningún mandamiento;
tan terrible es el odio
que ni te atreves a mostrarme tu desprecio,
pero no me hagas caso,
lo que me pasa es que este mundo no lo entiendo.",Sin Tu Latido
Silvio Rodríguez,"Como gasto papeles recordándote 
Como me haces hablar en el silencio 
Como no te me quitas de las ganas 
Aunque nadie me ve nunca contigo 
Y como pasa el tiempo que de pronto son años 
Sin pasar tú por mi, detenida 

Te doy una canción 
Si abro una puerta 
Y de las sombras sales tú
Te doy una canción de madrugada 
Cuando mas quiero tu luz
Te doy una canción 
Cuando apareces 
El misterio del amor 
Y si no no apareces 
No me importa 
Yo te doy una canción

Si miro un poco afuera me detengo 
La ciudad se derrumba 
Y yo cantando 
La gente que me odia y que me quiere 
No me va ha perdonar 
Que me distraiga
Creen que lo digo todo 
Que me juego la vida 
Porque no te conocen 
Ni te sienten

Te doy una canción y hago un discurso 
Sobre mi derecho ha hablar
Te doy una canción 
Con mis dos manos 
Con las mismas de matar
Te doy una canción 
Y digo patria 
Y sigo hablando para ti
Te doy una canción 
Como un disparo 
Como un libro 
Una palabra 
Una guerrilla
Como doy el amor",Te Doy Una Cancion
Silvio Rodríguez,"De tres hermanos el más grande se fue
Por la vereda a descubrir y a fundar
Y para nunca equivocarse o errar
Iba despierto y bien atento
A cuando iba a pisar
De tanto en esta posición caminar
Ya nunca el cuello se le enderezó
Y anduvo esclavo ya de la precaución
Y se hizo viejo queriendo ir lejos
Con su corta visión

Je, je, je, je, je, je
Ojo que no mira más allá, no ayuda al pie
Ju, ju, ju, ju, ju, ju
Óyeme esto y dime, dime lo que piensas tú
De tres hermanos el del medio se fue
Por la vereda a descubrir y a fundar
Y para nunca equivocarse o errar
Iba despierto y bien atento
Al horizonte igual
Pero este chico listo no podía ver
La piedra, el hoyo que vencía a su pie
Y revolcado siempre se la pasó
Y se hizo viejo queriendo ir lejos
A dónde no llegó
Je, je, je, je, je, je
Ojo que no mira más acá tampoco fue
Ju, ju, ju, ju, ju, ju

Óyeme esto y dime, dime lo que piensas tú
De tres hermanos el pequeño partió
Por la vereda a descubrir y a fundar
Y para nunca equivocarse o errar
Una pupila llevaba arriba
Y la otra en el andar
Y caminó vereda adentro el que más
Ojo en camino y ojo en lo porvenir
Y cuando vino el tiempo de resumir
Ya su mirada estaba extraviada
Entre el start y el in

Je, je , je, je, je, je
Ojo puesto en todo, ya ni sabe lo que ve
Ju, ju, ju , ju, ju, ju
Óyeme esto y dime, dime lo que piensas tú
Je, je , je, je, je, je
Ojo puesto en todo, ya ni sabe lo que ve
Ju, ju, ju , ju, ju, ju
Óyeme esto y dime, dime lo que piensas tú
Je, je , je, je, je, je
Ojo puesto en todo, ya ni sabe lo que ve
Ju, ju, ju , ju, ju, ju
Óyeme esto y dime, dime lo que piensas tú",Fabula de los Tres Hermanos
Silvio Rodríguez,"Imagínate
Que desde muy niño
Te llevaba flores
Te daba mi abrigo
Imagínate

Que soy el amigo
De tu mismo grado
Que lleva tus libros
Imagínate

Que soy de tu calle
Que siempre pasé
Por donde miraste
Imagínate

Que hasta mi perro
Me busca en tu puerta
Cuando me le pierdo
Imagínate

Que eres mi dama
Mi último sueño
Mi más roja flama
Imagínate

Que somos nosotros
Tú y yo para siempre
Que no eres de otro",Imaginate
Silvio Rodríguez,"Te amaré, te amaré como al mundo
Te amaré aunque tenga final
Te amaré, te amaré en lo profundo
Te amaré como tengo que amar

Te amaré, te amaré como pueda
Te amaré aunque no sea la paz
Te amaré, te amaré lo que queda
Te amaré cuando acabe de amar

Te amaré, te amaré si estoy muerto
Te amaré al día siguiente además
Te amaré, Te amaré como siento
Te amaré con adiós, con jamás

Te amaré, Te amaré junto al viento
Te amaré como único ser
Te amaré hasta el fin de los tiempos
Te amaré y después te amaré",Te Amare
Silvio Rodríguez,"Vamos a andar
En verso why vida tintos
Levantando el recinto
Del pan why la verdad

Vamos a andar
Matando el egoísmo
Para que por lo mismo
Reviva la amistad

Vamos a andar
Hundiendo al poderoso
Alzando al perezoso
Sumando a los demás

Vamos a andar
Con todas las banderas
Trenzadas de manera
Que no haya soledad

Vamos a andar
Para llegar
A la vida




",Vamos a Andar
Silvio Rodríguez,"Como una gota fui de la marea la playa me hizo grano de la arena
Fui punto en multitud por donde fui nadie me detectó y así aprendí
Cuando creí colmada la tarea volví mi corazón a Casiopea

Cumplí celosamente nuestro plan: por un millón de años esperar
Hoy llevo el doble dando coordenadas pero nadie contesta mi llamada
¿Qué puede haber pasado a mi señal? 
¿Será que me he quedado sin hogar? 

Hoy sobrevivo apenas a mi suerte lejano de mi estrella de mi gente
El trance me ha mostrado otra lección
el mundo propio siempre es el mejor
Me voy debilitando lentamente 
Quizás ya no sea yo cuando me encuentren",Casiopea
Silvio Rodríguez,"¿Por qué la tierra es mi casa? 
¿Por qué la noche es oscura? 
¿Por qué la luna es blancura 
Que engorda como adelgaza? 
¿Por qué una estrella se enlaza 
Con otra, como un dibujo? 
Y ¿por qué el escaramujo 
Es de la rosa y el mar? 
Yo vivo de preguntar
Saber no puede ser lujo

El agua hirviente en puchero 
Suelta un ánima que sube 
A disolverse en la nube 
Que luego será aguacero
Niño soy tan preguntero
Tan comilón del acervo
Que marchito si le pierdo 
Una contesta a mi pecho
Si saber no es un derecho
Seguro será un izquierdo

Yo vine para preguntar 
Flor y reflujo
Soy de la rosa y de la mar
Como el escaramujo

Soy aria, endecha, tonada
Soy Mahoma, soy Lao-Tsé
Soy Jesucristo y Yahvéh
Soy la serpiente emplumada
Soy la pupila asombrada 
Que descubre como apunta
Soy todo lo que se junta 
Para vivir y soñar
Soy el destino del mar
Soy un niño que pregunta

Yo vine para preguntar 
Flor y reflujo
Soy de la rosa y de la mar
Como el escaramujo",Escaramujo
Silvio Rodríguez,"Es día de frío 
Y llegas a casa. 
Llegas de la tarde 
Cansada de un jueves. 
Los muebles, tu perro 
Y millones de ojos 
Están, como siempre, 
Esperando tu vuelta, 
En la que presientes 
Que nada ha cambiado 
Te espera lo mismo, 
El sueño pasado. 

Recoges tu pelo 
Tan libre en la tarde 
Quizás porque alguien 
Nunca lo vio preso. 
Te sientas y cenas 
Y todas las culpas 
Te dan con un peso 
Mayor que tus fuerzas 
Y pon altos ojos 
Y esta tarde loca 
Hasta que eres débil 
Y tapas tu boca. 

Cuando todo pasa 
Te crees segura 
Mientras con tus horas 
Revuelves cenizas 
Presientes muy dentro 
Pasiones prohibidas 
No importa mentirse 
Para ser felices 
Hasta que un deseo 
Se meta en tu lecho 
Mas, qué estás pensando?
Te tapas el pecho. 

Pero necesitas 
Quedar bien con todo 
Todo que no sea 
Bien contigo misma. 
La angustia es el precio 
De ser uno mismo. 
Mejor ser felices 
Como nuestros padres 
Y hacer de la lástima 
Amores eternos 
Hasta que, a la larga, 
Te tape el invierno.",Cancion de Invierno
Silvio Rodríguez,"Me veo claramente 
Mascando un pedazo de hierba mojada
Me veo claramente 
Muy sucio y feliz

Me veo descubriendo 
Descalzo un buen rio de plantas ahogadas
Me veo claramente 
Lejano de aquí

Me veo claramente 
Haciendo preguntas que ya conocía 
Con indiferencia ante el 'ya crecerás'

Me veo claramente 
Tan aventurero hecho un asesino 
De azúcar y pan
Me veo claramente, me veo claramente
Si miro detrás

Me veo claramente 
En la mano una noche lugar de aprenderme 
Con miedo y paciencia 
Lo que era el amor

Me veo apretado 
Al calor de unas piernas, tragando del aire 
Un planeta tras otro 
Bañado en sudor

Me veo semi alzado 
En la luz de esa hora, riéndole al techo
Riéndole a ella, riéndome a mi

Me veo claramente 
Tan digno de amantes y breves países 
De felicidad
Me veo claramente, me veo claramente
Si miro detrás

Me veo claramente 
Marchando a campañas de guerra entre todos 
Y yendo a otras guerras 
Privadas también

Me veo claramente 
La primera noche, con una guitarra 
Tan pálidamente como cuando fuera 
La primera mujer

Me veo tan atento 
A los ruidos internos, feliz tristemente 
Queriendo de veras ser mucho mejor

Me veo claramente 
Buscando palabras que sepan dar vida 
Y dar muerte al amor
Me veo claramente, me veo claramente
Me veo si miro a mi alrededor",Me Veo Claramente (Introduction)
Silvio Rodríguez,"Conozco un vagabundo de espacio
Recorre el universo en su asteroide
Sin órbita, ni puerto, ni partida
Tapa la soledad con todo el frio
De su vida

Un día llegó un pájaro a su isla
Dentro de un pomo que cabía en su mano
Daba tristeza verlo allí encogido
Cantándole al silencio sin respuesta
Sin sentido

El vagabundo nunca oyó a su pájaro
Y lo veía cantar tras los cristales
Hasta que un dia pudo más su sueño
Y lo libró de la escafandra blanca 
De animales

El pájaro flotó hasta congelarse
Como las lá, grimas del vagabundo 
Entonces metió al pájaro en la jaula
Y lo soltó a la suerte con que vino
Sin comprender jamás 
Lo sucedido",El Vagabundo
Silvio Rodríguez,"Una mujer 
Por despecho (o por placer) 
Enterró en un jardín 
Un coco seco mojado en carmín
Luego un rival
Narcotraficando el mal
Escupía con ron 
Y alfilereaba un feliz corazón
Yo no sé 

Cómo hay quien malversa la vida 
Cómo hay quien invoca una herida 
Como pueden gastar el amor
Yo no sé 
Como si no faltaran cadenas
Como si nos sobraran las cenas 
Como si diera dicha el dolor
Yo no sé 

Si el mal tiempo trae mala fe
Si la desesperación hace blanco 
Y se cierran los laicos colegios
Si se vuelve al sortilegio 
Y aprendices de delfín 
Creen llegar a merlín
Yo no sé 

Si el mal tiempo trae mala fe
Pero a mí lo que me embruja es volar 
Y hechizarme con tus sortilegios
Soy brillante en tu colegio
Subo nota en el amor
Vuelo allí 
Como al sol 
Un colibrí

Abracadabra
Curandera mi palabra
Todo mal pone bien
Sana del odio y vacuna también

Silvio Rodríguez,"La guitarra del joven soldado 
Es pecosa y discreta. 
Es tan tímida que sólo canta 
Pasadas las diez. 

Cuando tocan silencio ella espera una hora 
Y se escurre de puntas, los pies, 
Y en el monte, debajo de un árbol, 
Suelta al viento su amor y su fe. 
Es recluta también 

La guitarra del joven soldado 
Revela secretos, 
Se desata por una mirada 
En arpegio de amor. 

Cada instante le pide tonadas y sones, 
Canciones que nunca escuchó, 
Y buscándolas siempre amanece 
Procurando un acorde mejor. 

La guitarra del joven soldado 
Hoy tampoco durmió. 

La guitarra del joven soldado 
Es la celosa amante que lo ha de seguir 
En la dicha y también en el llanto, 
Pero siempre ayudando a vivir.

Es su mejor fusil; 
Es su mejor fusil, 
Es su mejor fusil.",La Guitarra del Joven Soldado
Silvio Rodríguez,"De quererte cantar sufro disnea 
Bastante más allá de los pulmones
Tu sombra brilla hoy en la pelea 
Mayor de la conciencia y las razones
Por ti canto de pecho
Como el sueño en que giro 
Y leve, como aún respiro
Por ti adelanto trecho 
A lo que falta en tono 
Y canto lo que no perdono

Hombre, hombre y amigo
Aún queda para estar contigo
Hombre, hombre sin templo 
Desciende a mi ciudad tu ejemplo

Supiste cabalgar contra quien odia 
Desde su torre de odio y exterminio
Pero, en mi parecer, te dio más gloria 
El alma que tallaste a tu dominio
La medicina escasa
La más insuficiente 
Es la de remediar la mente
Y la locura pasa 
Risueña cuando engaña
Cual odio de la propia entraña

Hombre sin apellido
Un poco de piedad te pido
Hombre, ay, todavía
Que un tanto más allá está el día
De la melena inculta a la calvicie
Del número inicial a lo incontable
Desde la tumba hasta la superficie
Tras breve veinte tan multiplicable 
Me llega un canto alado 
De fiebres de la infancia
Me brota la invención del ansia 
Y entero y mutilado
Furiosamente a besos
Te doy mi corazón travieso

Hombre, hombre sin muerte
La noche respiró tu suerte
Hombre de buen destino
Y hay luces puestas en camino",Hombre
Silvio Rodríguez,"Soy ciudadano del amor
Llevo dogal de belleza
Entre la hombrera y la cabeza
Entre rodilla y cinturón

Haciendo crítica social
Me perfumé de valiente
Creyeron que era disidente
Y no era más que natural

Martí me habló de la amistad
Y creo en él cada día
Aunque la cruda economía
Ha dado luz a otra verdad

El mundo tiene la razón
Puesta en el pan, en el diario
Ese señor rudimentario
Que nos dará la absolución

Ciega
La vida nueva es
Como un verso al revés
Como un amor por descifrar
Como un dios en edad de jugar
Trino
Vete al destino, al punto que será final
Juega a lo que no jugué
Y canta que aunque sin rey mago
Sigo en pie

Seguro estoy requete mal
Debo sufrir algo extraño
Pues ni la hiel ni el desengaño
Me dan canción de funeral

El fin de siglo trae la sien
Cebada de podredumbre
Como invitándome a una lumbre
Que prenderá quien ame bien

Bendito el tiempo que me dio
Una canción sin permiso
Bendito sea el paraíso
Algo infernal que me parió

No quiero estar tras la puerta
Sino soñando bien alerta
Donde esté a salvo de perdón",Juego Que Me Regaló un 6 de Enero
Silvio Rodríguez,"Favor, no se molesten
Que pronto me estoy yendo
No vine a perturbarles 
Y menos a ofenderlos

Y oí voces cantando 
Y, sin querer, ya estaba tocando
Yo también me alegraba 
Entre amigos y cuerdas
Con licores y damas
Mas ¿de eso quien se acuerda? 
Una vez fui famoso
Siempre andaba viajando
Aquí traigo una foto
Actuando

Me recordaron tiempos 
De sueños e ilusiones
Perdonen a este viejo
Perdonen

Ya casi me olvidaba 
Pero, para mañana
Van a dar buen pescado
Hoy nos llegaron papas 
Y verduras en latas 
Al puesto del mercado
En cuanto llegue y coma 
Me voy para la zona
Por lo de la basura
Como la noche avanza 
Los dejo con la danza
El canto y la cultura

Disculpen la molestia
Ya me llevo mi boca
A mi edad la cabeza 
A veces se trastoca
En la alegría de ustedes 
Distinguí mis promesas 
Y todo me parece 
Que empieza
Favor, no se molesten
Que casi me estoy yendo
No quise perturbarles 
Y menos ofenderlos
Vi luz en las ventanas 
Y oí voces cantando 
Y, sin querer, ya estaba soñando
Vivo en la vieja casa 
De la bombilla verde
Si por allí pasaran
Recuerden",Monologo
Silvio Rodríguez,"Hoy a mi puerta un pájaro trinó
Pero abrí y una sombra se echó a volar

Hoy recordé a edgardo, aquel señor 
Fumador de ampolas, que era juglar

Hoy haré una página celeste
Trovadicta, trova ardiente
Hoy, cantando solo con la luna
Ya que se hizo puta la fortuna
Hoy me trovaré para alegrarme
Como edgardo, sin alarde

Silvio Rodríguez,"Siempre hay quien quisiera ser distinto
Nadie está conforme con lo que le tocó
El de edad quisiera ser un niño 
Y el rapaz se raspa sus pelusas en flor
Los que tienen nada quieren algo
Los que tienen algo quieren todavía más
Para pretender el mundo es largo
Para conformarse se a inventado el jamás

Un señor quisiera ser mujer 
Y una chica quiere ser señor
Hasta dios sueña que es un poder
Y mariana quiere ser canción

La tolerancia es la pasión de los inquisidores
El buen ladrón quisiera no tener que robar
Le deben al silencio la voz los ruiseñores
La eternidad no es más que un truco 
Para continuar

La libertad sólo es visible para quien la labra 
Y en lo prohibido brilla astuta la tentación
Nacer a veces mata y ser feliz desgarra
¿a quién acusaremos cuando triunfe el amor? 

Un señor quisiera ser mujer 
Y una chica quiere ser señor
Hasta dios sueña que es un poder
Y mariana quiere ser canción",Y Mariana
Silvio Rodríguez,"Ya te estoy recordando, Rosana,
Aunque no te hayas ido,
El lucero que brilla mañana
Es lo que te he querido.
Ya te estoy recordando, elegida,
Como un reo en la sombra
Resucita el color de la vida,
Lo acaricia why lo nombra.

Ni un centavo te cuesta este beso,
Pues mi alma lo paga.
Sólo espero lo mismo por eso,
Hasta el fin de la saga.
Cuando escriban la vida los buenos,
Al final vencedores,
Se sabrá que no usamos veneno
Como aroma de flores.

Brotará de la sangre ternura,
Inocencia why espejos
Donde irán a correr travesuras
Nuevos niños why viejos.
Servirá de señal cada huella
De las horas felices.
Se sabrá tanto de las estrellas
Como de cicatrices.

why el camino que emprendas, Rosana,
Será mejor a veces,
Porque en otros momentos, cubana,
Tu llorarás con creces.
Ya te vas. Yo no me quedo why no atino
A saber qué ha pasado.
Sólo sé que, por causa o destino,
Ya no estás a mi lado.
",Rosana
Silvio Rodríguez,"Hoy viene a ser como la
Cuarta vez que espero
Desde que se que no vendrás mas nunca
He vuelto a ser aquel cantor del aguacero
Que hizo casi legal su abrazo a tu cintura
Y tu apareces, en mi ventana
Suave y pequeña, con alas blancas
Yo ni te miro, para que duermas
Y no te vayas

Que maneras mas curiosas
De recordar tiene uno
Que maneras mas curiosas
Hoy recuerdo mariposas
Que ayer solo fueron humo
Mariposas, mariposas
Que emergieron de lo oscuro
Bailarinas, silenciosas

Tu tiempo es ahora una mariposa
Navecita blanca, delgada, nerviosa
Siglos atrás inundaron un segundo
Debajo del cielo, encima del mundo
Así eras tu en aquella tarde, divertida
Así eras tu de furibunda compañera
Eras como esos días en que eres la vida
Y todo lo que tocas se hace primavera
Ay mariposa!, tu eres el alma
De los guerreros que aman y cantan
Y eres el nuevo ser, que hoy se asoma
Por mi garganta

Silvio Rodríguez,"Olivia despertó por la mañana 
Como suele hacer la gente 
Mas o menos con el sol 
Era un sábado mas en su ventana 
Era una invitación para la suerte 
Era una semejanza del amor 
Mientras trenzaba hijas y calor 
Con la soledad 
Era soledad, salia el sol 

Olivia en su península poblada 
Por la lentitud del día 
Por el tiempo sin hacer 
Sobre su condicio iba clavada 
Como una diosa de la luna fría 
Que a las estrellas quiere conocer 
Y dio a una piedra errante de comer 
Con su soledad 
Era la soledad y vio llover 

Olivia no sabia que la noche 
Tiene puentes de aguacero 
Para llegar a su umbral 
Olivia no sabia que hay un coche 
Y un precipicio al borde del cohero 
Y oyó decir que un astro hinchaba el mar 
Y salio de su isla a caminar 
Sin la soledad 
Era la soledad, oyó cantar",Olivia
Silvio Rodríguez,"Con polvo del Arauco 
Con piedra del Azteca 
Con sangre del esclavo 
Es la resurrección 
Que enciende mariposas 
Why las arroja al viento, 
Que dá al volcán su toca 
Why al trueno su canción. 
El sol ha sido izado 
Por sus primeros sueños, 
Que aullan despertando 
Por la convocación. 

El polvo con el polvo, 
La piedra con la piedra 
Se juntan como rostros 
Why surge la ciudad. 
La antigua cordillera 
Dibuja el sortilegio 
Why al viento vá, afilando 
Cantando libertad. 
Retornan los guerreros 
Al grito de la tierra. 
De nuevo la leyenda 
Se hare realidad. 

De polvo sin mentiras, 
De piedras con entrañas 
Sabiendo que la vida 
Es dura como es, 
Los muertos no equivocan 
Su cita con el alba: 
Los muertos tienen bocas 
Why corazón why pies. 
Los muertos han llegado 
El tiempo los convoca. 
Los muertos son estrellas 
Que no tienen revés.
",La Resurreccion
Silvio Rodríguez,"Viajamos entre la tormenta,
Después de la explosión de Dios.
Cada relámpago nos muestra
Fantasmagóricos de amor.
A cada paso se hunde el lodo,
Salta un reptil, acechan diez.
Cada segundo es como el cobro
De lo que resultamos ser.

A bordo de esta expedición
Va un loco, un albañil,
Un nigromante, un ruiseñor
Why un beso espadachín.
Nos falta un día, un niño, un don
Para sobrevivir.

Primero fuimos los heraldos
Llevando buenas del Señor,
Pero excedimos su mandato
Cargando el peso del dolor.
Hoy somos ángeles caídos
Junto al que fuimos a curar.
Temen que a nuestros propios hijos
Les enseñemos a volar.

Silvio Rodríguez,"Al borde de una laguna 
Tres brujas montan caldero 
Y baten un mundo espeso

Una le pone la luna
Otra sangre de cordero
Y otra los últimos besos

De camelot vuelan señales 
En los dragones y los cuernos 
Y hay un silencio de animales 
Mientras se anuncian los infiernos

El odio al otro es nuestra suerte 
La sangre ajena es nuestra viña 
Cuando profanen y den muerte
Seremos aves de rapiña

Los contrahechos del norte 
Y un enano de alcahuete 
Sádicos abominables

Reclutan tribus y cortes 
Para gestión de grilletes 
Y corazones de sables

Y una vez más como tragedia 
Ronda el olor a carne rota 
De calabozo de edad media 
Donde callaban al ilota 

Y una vez más contra el impulso 
De besar y abrazar a gentes 
Ceder al último recurso 
Ojo por ojo, y diente a diente",Camelot
Silvio Rodríguez,"Desde los tiempos más remotos
Vuelan los ángeles guardianes
Siempre celosos de sus votos
Contra atropellos y desmanes
Junto a las cunas infantiles
Junto los tristes moribundos
Cuentan que velan los gentiles
Seres con alas de otro mundo

Cuando este ángel surca el cielo
No hay nada que se le asemeje
El fin de su apurado vuelo
Es la sentencia de un hereje
No se distraiga ni demore
Todo es ahora inoportuno
Va rumbo al campo de las flores
Donde la hoguera espera a bruno

Se lanza un ángel de la altura
Caída libre que da frío
La orden de su jefatura
Es descender hasta dos ríos
Es 19 y también mayo
Monte de espuma y madre sierra
Cuando otro ángel a caballo
Cae “con los pobres de la tierra”

Dicen que al filo de la una
Un angelote compasivo
Pasó delante de la luna
Sobrevolando los olivos
Y cuentan que con mala maña
Fue tiroteado su abanico
Justo a la hora que en españa
Se nos mataba a federico

Un bello arcángel aletea
Junto a un gran pájaro de hierro
Procura que un hombre lo vea
Para ahuyentar cien mil destierros
Pero el arcángel se sofoca
Y un ala azul se le lastima
Y el ave negra abre la boca
Cuando atraviesan hiroshima

Dejando un surco luminoso
Por sobre Memphis, Tennesse
Pasó volando presuroso
Un ser alado en frenesí
Iba vistiéndose de luto
Iba llorando el querubín
E iba contando los minutos
De dios y Martín Luther King

El ángel pasa bajo un puente
Después rodea un rascacielos
Parque central, lleno de gente
No se da cuenta de su vuelo
Cuánta utopía será rota
Y cuánta imaginación
Cuando a la puerta del Dakota
Las balas derriben a John

Septiembre aúlla todavía
Su doble saldo escalofriante
Todo sucede un mismo día
Gracias a un odio semejante
Y el mismo ángel que allá en chile
Vio bombardear al presidente
Ve las dos torres con sus miles
Cayendo inolvidablemente

Desesperados, los querubes
Toman los cielos de la tierra
Y con sus lápices de nubes
Pintan adioses a las guerras
El mundo llena los balcones
Y exclama al fin: esta es mi lucha
Pero el señor de los cañones
No mira al cielo ni lo escucha

Pobres los ángeles urgentes
Que nunca llegan a salvarnos
¿será que son incompetentes
O que no hay forma de ayudarnos?
Para evitarles más dolores
Y cuentas del sicoanalista
Seamos un tilín mejores
Y mucho menos egoístas",Cita con Ángeles
Silvio Rodríguez,"Como tiernas babosas de la campiña 
Ella y el se enroscaron humedamente humedamente 
Y el dejo de ser hombre como ella niña 
Para ser uno solo completamente completamente 

Desde todos los puntos que los juntaban 
Se saborearon tanto y con tal delicia 
Que las horas de vida que les quedaban 
Decidieron pasarlas en la caricia 

A menos de un suspiro del tibio abrazo 
El resto de la historia se debatía 
En átomos, galaxias y otros acasos 
Encontraron certezas justo aquel día 
Encontraron certezas justo aquel día

Por la luminosidad

Mi casa ha sido tomada por las flores
Traigan copas, traigan vasos
Al derrame de colores
Mi casa ha sido tomada por las flores
Vengan almas y retazos

De las leyendas que fueron manas 
Pasa la sombra infeliz de aladino 
Sin una lampara para el camino 
Y sin el secreto de alibabá

Alguien debiera hacer estallar 
El hongo de los derechos civiles 
De los fantasmas que pueblan

De sheresada en su lecho nupcial

De la cultura, la carne, la mente

Mil una noche de intimidación

Silvio Rodríguez,"Un buen día quizás un barquero 
Se lanzó tras el mar del recuerdo. 
Era un barco pequeño en el tiempo 
Pero había fe, 
Pero había un raro esplendor en sus ojos, 
Pero había un místico afán de por qué, 
Pero había fe. 

Una dársena es sólo una entraña; 
Mar de invierno es tal vez la mañana; 
Barco chico es quizás alma clara; 
Why aunque haya fe, 
Why aunque haya flujo de amor en mi frente, 
Tanto se hunde mi rostro en la gente, 
Que ya no sé. 

Ya me canso de tanto hablar, 
Si está dicho todo hasta el fin, 
Qué más ruido que el de escuchar 
De la vida, todo el trajín. 
Tanto espacio entre mi voz 
Why el oído que ha de esperar. 
Nada tengo que decir yo. 
Miren todo why me escucharán. 

Un buen día quizás un barquero 
Se lanzó tras el mar del recuerdo. 
De su barco, entre grito why silencio, 
Aún no se sabe 
Cuál de las tantas ha sido su suerte: 
Si halló la vida o se fue con la muerte, 
O simplemente se perdió. 

",El Barquero
Silvio Rodríguez,"Aunque las cosas cambien de color, 
No importa pase el tiempo, 
Las cosas suelen transformarse 
Siempre al caminar. 
Pero tras la guitarra siempre habrá una voz 
Más vista o más perdida por la incomprensión 
De ser uno que siente, como en otro tiempo 
Fue también. 

Hay también corazones que hoy se sienten detenidos. 
Aunque sean otros tiempos hoy, 
Why mañana será también: 
Se sigue conversando con el mar. 

Aunque las cosas cambien de color, 
No importa pase el tiempo, 
No importa la palabra 
Que se diga para amar, 
Pues siempre que se cante con el corazón 
Habrá un sentido atento para la emoción de ver 
Que la guitarra es la guitarra 
Sin envejecer. 

",La Canción de La Trova
Silvio Rodríguez,"¿Qué silencio es culpable de la muerte de un hombre? 
¿Qué silencio en nosotros ha colgado inocentes? 
¿Qué silencio maldito ha cegado algún nombre? 
¿Cuántas veces al día merecemos la muerte? 

No busquen más alrededor
Ustedes son
No busquen más, no es el de atrás
ustedes son

No es el de al lado, no
Eres tú mismo, sí

El que sabe callar

Solo en la soledad de su cabeza
Solo en la soledad de las butacas

Se mira entonces la guitarra y se le guiña un ojo 
Qué no sabrán del abandono la guitarras

Después que canta, el hombre queda solo
Pues cada uno regresa a sus pisadas
Le dejan las palabras en la alfombra
La hora de la palabra fue la escena
Sabe que ahora, de pronto, se hace luego
Aunque después que cante quede ciego

Después que canta, el hombre queda solo

Tu junto a la ventana como a contraluz 
Echada en el lecho queriendo mirar 
Los ojos profundos del sol 
Detrás de tu cuerpo feliz 
Desnudo , desnudo y ya es
El día en que voy a partir

No te muevas, si puede estar quieta la felicidad 
Si puede volverse de piedra el amor 
Convierte en estatuas los días y el mar 
Quizás te comprenda mejor 
O al menos conforme ya este 
Repleto de piedras sin sed
El día en que voy a partir

No te muevas, y dime si es hora de irse a dormir

Que un beso muy frío será

Del día en que voy a partir",El Día en Que Voy a Partir
Silvio Rodríguez,"Ayer mataron a un lobo en la puerta de mi casa 
Con la cabeza vencida sobre la acera soñaba 
Observaba la bodega donde peleaba y dormía 
Con la pupila vidriosa mira pasar el día 
Y los niños de su mundo hablaban en voz muy baja 
De su mirada

Para el resto de la tierra, allí había un perro muerto 
Un perro que en unas horas estaría descompuesto 
Había que limpiar la acera de aquella mancha oscura
Para el resto de la tierra un perro muerto es basura
Pero los niños jugaban y volvían a su lado 
Siempre callados

Lobo yo si te recuerdo echado al camino 
Con el sol curándote el lomo desecho 
De andar a la noche batallando con tus enemigos

Lobo yo si te recuerdo, yo también sabía 
Donde, como y cuando dormías tu sueño
Para esos asuntos no he crecido mucho todavía

Como no iba a recordarte si estás ahí desde mi niñez 
En un paisaje diferente pero igual, si a todos nos paso una vez
Como no iba a recordarte si tu misterio es más feliz 
Que muchas cosas que tenemos que contar a costa de una cicatriz
Como de un hierro caliente 
Que deja la memoria ardiente 
Sin la nobleza de tu muerte 
Y sin un peso, con más suerte 
Que no sea la de maldecir",Discurso Fúnebre

Decorando el Congreso Cultural

Quieren esas cosas
Que para verlas tengo que cerrar los ojos

Que coincidía cada noche
Una suerte de sueños que hacían cuadrilla
Unos buenos muchachos riendo juntos
Érase que se era una vez

Por esa época se amaba tanto, qué sé yo
¡Qué época tanta de amores!
Desfilábamos juntos, se hacían poemas
Y las calles que buenos gustos tenían
Érase que se era una vez

De uno en fondo pasábamos 
Por la misma canción
Era uno, eran dos, eran tantos qué sé yo
Pero era bonito mirarnos, vernos sufrir
Érase que se era una vez

Era imposible pasar un sólo día sin morir
Sin gritar, sin reír, sin comprender, sin amar
Qué desastre de gente que no podía estar en paz
Érase que se era una vez

Yo no sé si fue el tiempo que lo vuela todo
O si fuimos nosotros detonando el tiempo
Pero nos fragmentamos como una granada
Érase que se era una vez

Cada esquirla en el sitio en que haya caído
Si hay guardada una tarde común en el tiempo

Arañando el silencio con tus ojos 
Tratando de decir algo que las palabras 
Nunca hubieran dicho mejor
Aquella mirada 
Era el resumen de la noche posado en tus ojos 
Con su lluvia, su viento y tu miedo al mar 
Y aquel sueño que te conté

No puedo dejarte de ver 
Describiendo una estrella descubierta por mí 
En tu erótica constelación 
Que no cabe en los mapas del cielo
Tu mano dibujando en el aire 
Era capaz de ponerle colores 
Al espacio vacío que se llenaba 
Con la luz de la estrella brillante

Cuida bien tus estrellas, mujer 
Cuida bien tus estrellas
Cuida bien tus estrellas, mujer 
Cuida bien tus estrellas
Cuida bien tus estrellas, mujer

No puedo dejar de decir 
Que hay idiomas perfectos por descubrir 
Y que son olvidados frecuentemente 
En el tedio del tiempo 
Y hay que buscarlos, 
Porque los barcos y las piedras 
Tienen abecedarios mejores 
Para demostrar que son bellos sencillamente 
Sin palabras o esquemas

No puedo dejar de decir 
Que esta triste canción a tu lado oscurece 
Que quizás este sea el último misterio 
Que mirarán tus ojos nacer de mis manos
Pues es tarde quizás para mí 
Y caín me ha marcado sobre la frente 
Pero quiero alertarte de un gran peligro 
Y quisiera encenderte esta frase en la mente

Cuida bien tus estrellas, mujer 
Cuida bien tus estrellas 
Cuida bien tus estrellas, mujer

De un raro mineral

Y muchas animal

Se confunde el deseo 
De calentar la piel 
Con rugidos lejanos 
Que recuerdan mujer

Y en una playa angosta caen del cielo 
Esas reminiscencias de veneno
Yo no sé, pero hay días sin reposo 
Que lo que tenga cerca lo destrozo 
Muy primitivamente, casi salvajemente
Con odio, con desprecio, con rencor
Con palabras hirientes, con garras y con dientes
Con rabia, con violencia, con horror

Le he cantado a la muerte como nadie con vida
Mas yo dijera siempre: querida
Junto a cada palabra hay cuerpos de millones 
Y los maté yo mismo
Perdonen

A veces se me borra 
Que mato por vivir 
Y olvido los entierros 
Y no quiero dormir

El día que me acusen 
No me defenderé
Esta culpa es muy vieja
De todos la heredé

Y en una playa angosta caen del cielo 
Esas reminiscencias de veneno
Yo no sé, pero hay días sin reposo 
Que lo que tenga cerca lo destrozo 
Muy primitivamente, casi salvajemente
Con odio, con desprecio, con rencor
Con palabras hirientes, con garras y con dientes
Con rabia, con violencia, con horror",El Matador
Silvio Rodríguez,"Una mujer, una mujer
Una mujer con cristales de mar 
Vieja dentro de mí 
Coloreando mi sangre 
Quitando el carbón 
Que ha tapado mi buen corazón
Que ha tapado mi buen corazón

Una mujer, una mujer
Una mujer que no es celestial 
Sobre un potro partió 
Hacia todos los pueblos 
Que habitan en mi 
Y ha tenido un camino feliz
Y ha tenido un camino feliz

Pobre de mí, pobre de ti
Pobre de todos que amen así 
Sobre un potro que vuela 
Ignorando barrancos 
Tan cercanos que lucen mortajas 
De blanco

Pobre de mí, pobre de ti
Pobre montura que cuelga al amor 
Sobre tanto desastres 
Y canciones sin mangos 
Sobre tanta cansada emoción 
Que dejaste

Una mujer, una mujer
Una mujer no esperada por mí 
Cabalgando llegó 
A cavar en mi tierra 
Su nombre y canción 
Y a soltar bajo fianza el amor
Y a soltar bajo fianza el amor",Una Mujer

Silvio Rodríguez,"Nunca he creido que alguien me odia
Aunque me hallan querido matar
Tras mis asesinos se esconde otra fuerza 
Que si es mi enemiga mortal

Todos los tipos de muerte hacen cola 
Ante mi puerta esperando su hora
El instrumento es quien cambia de rostro 
Pero yo se que hay un unico odio

Se que todas las palabras 
Con que le canto a la vida 
Vienen con muerte tambien
Se que el pasado me odia 
Y que no va a perdonarme 
Mi amor con el porvenir

Por eso manda verdugos 
Con todos los uniformes
Mi asesino es el pasado
Aunque con mano de hombre

Siempre que un hombre le pega a otro hombre 
No es al cuerpo al que le quiere dar
En ese puño va el odio a una idea 
Que lo agrede, que lo hace cambiar

Cuando lo quieto se siente movido 
Todo cambia de sentido
Y en la medida en que todo acelera 
Sigue cambiando la esfera

Siempre tendre un enemigo 
Con el semblante arrugado 
Y mas cansado que yo
Los que a lo largo de su sombra 
Quieren cortar la medida 
De toda revolucion

Y ya se dijo que es mas grande
Que el mas grande de nosotros
Y ya se dijo que se hace para otros",Nunca He Creído Que Alguien Me Odia
Silvio Rodríguez,"A los 27 días de mayo 
Del año 70 un hombre se sube 
Sobre sus derrotas 
Pide la palabra momentos antes de 
Volverse loco 
No es un hombre, es un malabarista 
De una generación 
No es un hombre quizás un objeto 
De la diversión 
Un juguete común de la historia 
Como un monograma que dice bufón 
Ese hombre soy yo, ese hombre soy yo 

Pero debo decir que me toco nacer 
En el pasado y que no volveré 
Es por eso que un día me vi en el presente 
Con un pie allá donde vive la muerte 
Y otro pie suspendido en el aire 
Buscando un lugar, reclamando tierra del futuro 
Para descansar 
Así estamos yo y mis hermanos 
Como un precipicio en el equilibrio 
Y como ojos de vidrio
Y como ojos de vidrio

Ahora quiero hablar de poetas muertos y poetas vivos 
De tantos muchachos hijos de esta fiesta 
Y de las torturas de ser ellos mismos 
Porque hay que decir 
Que hay quien muere sobre su papel 
Pues vivirle a la vida su talla tiene que doler 
Nuestra vida es tan alta, tan alta 
Que para tocarla casi hay que morir 
Para luego vivir, para luego vivir 

Yo no reniego de lo que me toca 
Yo no me arrepiento pues no tengo culpas 
Pero hubiera querido poderme jugar 
Toda la muerte allá en el pasado 
O toda la vida en el porvenir que no puedo alcanzar 
Y con esto no quiero 
Decir que me ponga a llorar
Se que hay que seguir navegando 
Sigan exigiéndome cada vez mas 
Hasta poder seguir, hasta poder seguir
Reventar",Oda a Mi Generación
Silvio Rodríguez,"Cuando se ande descalzo
Paso a paso de viento
Cuando venga del polvo la ciudad destruida
Que alguien cante una estrofa a las manos de un muerto
Que alguien diga algún verso a su espacio de vida

Puede ser 
Que sus restos no se distingan en la ciudad 
Que la perfección de la piedra no luzca piel
Puede ser que su sangre no mueva una astronave
Puede ser que sus huesos no sirvan para torres
Puede ser que una estrella brille mas que su voz
Ha pasado que el llanto se convierte en palabras
Ha pasado que sangre se convierte en palabras
Ha pasado que un hombre se convierte en palabras
Palabras, palabras, palabras a granel

Cuando la muerte sea inalcanzable y rara
Cuando un mohoso grillete repose en la vitrina
Que se dé a cada hijo una flor y una bala
Que se sepa que el mundo va sembrado de vidas

Se sabrá que este ir y venir de piedras no se quedó
Que una lluvia lejana fue a mojar la ciudad
Fijaremos con clavos las ventanas
Los sueños, los pedazos de tierra
La limpieza y el lodo, las guitarras
Las sillas, las piedras y el amor
Porque ha pasado que el llanto 
Se convierte en palabras
Ha pasado que sangre 
Se convierte en palabras
Ha pasado que un hombre
Se convierte en palabras
Ha pasado que historia 
Se convierte en palabras
Ha pasado que el mundo 
Se convierte en palabras
Ha pasado que todo se convierte en palabras

Dinero de aguardiente, 
De ""El Sol de Cuba"", 
De la cerveza,

Why maldiciones 
A tus muchachos. 
Eras el personaje 
De los trajines 
De tu pueblo: 
Eras para la gracia, 
Eras un viejo, 
Eras negro. 

Una noche el respeto 
Bajó why te puso 
Bella corona: 
Respeto de mortales 
Que, muerto, al fin 
Te hizo persona. 
Pobre del que pensó

De tu existencia 
Fue el de tu muerte.

Silvio Rodríguez,"Por muchos lugares pasaba la historia
Tú leías a whitman, con estilo triste
Tus alrededores ya estaban poblando 
De sed las palabras que usaste esta tarde
Entonces ya estaban previstos tus gustos
Cada vieja fecha posee estas artes

Por eso no es raro que muchos no entiendan
Pues muchos supimos de los mismos rumbos
Por eso no es raro que nadie domine 
Las riendas de todos sus mundos

Por muchos lugares pasaba la historia
El antigua egipto ya nos condenaba
Todos conspiraron para reprimirnos 
Y como las lluvias vinieron las guerras
Y el tiempo ha llorado detrás de las estructuras
Pues nada se salva del orden perfecto

Por muchos lugares pasaba la historia
Ya cada palabra era una duda 
Y elegir la clave de cada conciencia
Y a ti, tan pequeña y resumen del mundo
Todo te tenía que arder cuando viste 
Moros en las costas de cada palabra

Por muchos lugares pasaba la historia
El mundo era un vasto sembrado de huesos 
Y las hortalizas un día crecieron 
Nutridas del jugo vital de los cuerpos
Y supe que escombros regados por tierra 
Pueden fecundarle mañana la entraña",Por Muchos Lugares

¿Qué quiere de nosotros nuestra sombra?

Con agua de lluvia y sin sacudirse 
Del polvo nocturno remonta el camino 
Que hizo la muerte que fue la primera 
Que abriera una trocha en la selva

En el fondo y en la superficie está más solo 
Que un simple muerto, quizás más colores 
Que busca los halle en las alas de un ángel 
O con los demonios o en otro universo mejor 
Su pobre arco iris tiene dos colores 
El negro y el blanco y es triste la lluvia pintada con grises
Qué cosa más triste
Qué cosa más triste
Qué cosa más triste
Qué triste y qué cosa

El seguidor ha cargado los hijos ajenos 
Sobre sus rodillas gastadas pasando 
Quien siembre semillas tendrá que velarlas 
Cuando lo recuerda vacía sus bolsillos al suelo
Bota los papeles, el polvo, la hoja de afeitarse
Aunque son solo escombros que halla rodando en cunetas 
De cualquier camino
De cualquier camino
De cualquier camino
Qué miedo a quedarse

El seguidor de arco iris siempre se despide 
Nadie lo conoce a mitad del saludo 
Es un vagabundo lleno de recuerdos 
Que será olvidado por ser tan ligero 
Por no usar corbata ni polvo en el ceño 
Por irse a llorar donde lloran los perros al fondo de un patio

Con la muerte com&utilde;n

Los que no tienen nada que perder
Ni siquiera la muerte

Menos mal que existen 
Los que no miden qué palabra echar
Ni siquiera la última

Se arriman a la noche y al día 
Y sudan si hay calor 
Y si hay frío se mudan

Pues viven

Conocer el delirio y el polvo
Se ha perdido esta bella locura
Su breve cintura debajo de mí
Se ha perdido mi forma de amar
Se ha perdido mi huella en su mar

Veo una luz que vacila
Y promete dejarnos a oscuras
Veo un perro ladrando a la luna
Con otra figura que recuerda a mí
Veo más: veo que no me halló
Veo más: veo que se perdió

La cobardía es asunto
De los hombres, no de los amantes
Los amores cobardes no llegan a amores
Ni a historias, se quedan allí
Ni el recuerdo los puede salvar
Ni el mejor orador conjugar

Huye como una gaviota
Y yo rápido seco mis botas
Blasfemo una nota y apago el reloj

I really wanna see ya
Omobolasire
Hang on because I'm on my way

She is my lover
From the heart of Africa
Like no other
Princess of Nigeria
I was delirious
Ya that sun was beating down
Lady mysterious
Like an oasis that I found

And then she smiled
And then she came
And when she spoke
She told me her name

Omobolasire
I really wanna see ya
Omobolasire
Hang on because I'm on my way

Short cut through Lagos
Through the market place together
Was getting serious
I could have stayed that way forever

As fate dictated
I had to go back home to London
My heart vibrated
Because I knew I had to get to you

Omobolasire
I really wanna see ya
Omobolasire
Hang on because I'm on my way

Then came that sad day
A flight from Heathrow back to Lagos
Desperate to see ya
But they would not let me through

What can I do?

And everyday
My letters will say

And the words that you write
Came and filled up my night with your tenderness

Simon & Garfunkel,"The last train is nearly due
The underground is closing soon
And in the dark deserted station
Restless in anticipation
A man waits in the shadows

His restless eyes leap and scratch
At all that they can touch or catch
And hidden deep within his pocket
Safe within its silent socket
He holds a colored crayon

Now from the tunnel's stony womb
The carriage rides to meet the groom
And opens wide and welcome doors
But he hesitates, then withdraws
Deeper in the shadows

And the train is gone suddenly
On wheels clicking silently
Like a gently tapping litany
And he holds his crayon rosary
Tighter in his hand

Now from his pocket quick he flashes
The crayon on the wall he slashes
Deep upon the advertising
A single-worded poem comprised of four letters

And his heart is laughing, screaming, pounding
The poem across the tracks rebounding
Shadowed by the exit light
His legs take their ascending flight
To seek the breast of darkness and be suckled by the night, ooh",A Poem on the Underground Wall [Demo]

He was singin' on his knees
An angry mob trailed along
They shot my brother dead
Because he hated what was wrong

I've walked around Soho for the last night or so.
Ah, but it doesn't matter, no.

Blessed is the land and the kingdom.
Blessed is the man whose soul belongs to.
Blessed are the meth drinkers, Pot sellers, Illusion dwellers.
O Lord, Why have you forsaken me?

That I have no intention to heal.

Simon & Garfunkel,"Through the corridors of sleep
Past shadows dark and deep
My mind dances and leaps in confusion
I don't know what is real
I can't touch what I feel
And I hide behind the shield of my illusion

So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end
And flowers never bend
With the rainfall

The mirror on my wall
Casts an image dark and small
But I'm not sure at all it's my reflection
I am blinded by the light
Of God and truth and right
And I wander in the night without direction

So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end
And flowers never bend
With the rainfall

No matter if you're born
To play the King or pawn
For the line is thinly drawn 'tween joy and sorrow
So my fantasy
Becomes reality
And I must be what I must be and face tomorrow

So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end
And flowers never bend
With the rainfall",Flowers Never Bend with the Rainfall
Simon & Garfunkel,"A winter's day
In a deep and dark
December
I am alone
Gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock
I am an island

I've built walls
A fortress deep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship, friendship causes pain
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain
I am a rock
I am an island

Don't talk of love
But I've heard the words before
It's sleeping in my memory
I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died
If I never loved I never would have cried
I am a rock
I am an island

I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room, safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me
I am a rock
I am an island

And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries",I Am a Rock
Simon & Garfunkel,"The night sets softly with the hush of falling leaves
Casting shivering shadows on the houses through the trees
And the light from a street lamp paints a pattern on my wall
Like the pieces of a puzzle or a child's uneven scrawl

Up a narrow flight of stairs in a narrow little room
As I lie upon my bed in the early evening gloom
Impaled on my wall, my eyes can dimly see
The pattern of my life and the puzzle that is me

From the moment of my birth to the instant of my death
There are patterns I must follow just as I must breathe each breath
Like a rat in a maze, the path before me lies
And the pattern never alters until the rat dies

And the pattern still remains on the wall where darkness fell
And it's fitting that it should, for in darkness I must dwell
Like the color of my skin or the day that I grow old
My life is made of patterns that can scarcely be controlled

",Patterns [#][*][Demo Version]
Simon & Garfunkel,"It was in the merry month of May
When green bugs were a-swelling
Sweet William on his death bed lay
For the love of Barbriallen

He sent his servant to the town
The place where she'd been dwelling
Say master dear has sent me here
If your name be Barbriallen

And slowly, slowly she got up
And slowly she went to him
And all she said when she got there
""Young man, I think you are dying""

Oh, don't you remember the other day
When we where in a tavern?
You drank, your health to the ladies there
And you slided Barbriallen

He turned his face unto the wall
He turned his back upon her
Adieu, adieu to all my friends
Be kind to Barbriallen

She looked to the east, she looked to the west
She saw his corpse a-coming
""Oh, put him down for me"", she cried
""That I may gaze upon him""

The more she looked, the more she grieved
She busted out in crying
Oh, pick me up and carry me home
For I feel like I am dying

They buried sweet Willy in the old church yard
And Barbara in the new one
From Willy's grave there grew a rose
From Barbara's a green briar

They grew and they grew on the old church wall
And could not grow no higher
And there they tied in a true love's knot
The rose bush and the briar",Barbriallen [#][*][Demo Version]

Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums

Just a puppet on a lonely string

Simon & Garfunkel,"Cloudy
The sky is gray and white and cloudy,
Sometimes I think it's hanging down on me
And it's a hitchhike a hundred miles
I'm a rag-a-muffin child
Pointed finger-painted smile
I left my shadow waiting down the road for me a while

Cloudy
My thoughts are scattered and they're cloudy,
They have no borders, no boundaries
They echo and they swell
From Tolstoy to Tinker Bell
Down from Berkeley to Carmel
Got some pictures in my pocket and a lot of time to kill

Hey sunshine
I haven't seen you in a long time
Why don't you show your face and bend my mind?
These clouds stick to the sky
Like floating questions, why?
And they linger there to die
They don't know where they are going, and, my friend, neither do I

Simon & Garfunkel,"It's a still life watercolor
Of a now-late afternoon
As the sun shines through the curtained lace
And shadows wash the room

And we sit and drink our coffee
Couched in our indifference, like shells upon the shore
You can hear the ocean roar

In the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs
The borders of our lives

And you read your Emily Dickinson
And I my Robert Frost
And we note our place with book markers
That measure what we've lost

Like a poem poorly written
We are verses out of rhythm
Couplets out of rhyme
In syncopated time

And the dangled conversation
And the superficial sighs
Are the borders of our lives

Yes, we speak of things that matter
With words that must be said
""Can analysis be worthwhile?""
""Is the theater really dead?""

And how the room is softly faded
And I only kiss your shadow, I cannot feel your hand
You're a stranger now unto me

Lost in the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs
In the borders of our lives",The Dangling Conversation
Simon & Garfunkel,"When she goes, she's gone.
If she stays, she stays here.
The girl does what she wants to do.
She knows what she wants to do.
And I know I'm fakin' it,
I'm not really makin' it.

I'm such a dubious soul,
And a walk in the garden
Wears me down.
Tangled in the fallen vines,
Pickin' up the punch lines,
I've just been fakin' it,
Not really makin' it.

Is there any danger?
No, not not really.
Just lean on me.
Takin' time to treat
Your friendly neighbors honestly.
I've just been fakin' it,
I'm not really makin' it.
This feeling of fakin' it
I still haven't shaken it.

Prior to this lifetime
I surely was a tailor
I own the tailor's face and hands.

Simon & Garfunkel,"What a dream I had
Pressed in organdy
Clothed in crinoline of smoky Burgundy
Softer than the rain

I wandered empty streets down
Past the shop displays
I heard cathedral bells
Tripping down the alleyways
As I walked on

And when you ran to me, your
Cheeks flushed with the night
We walked on frosted fields of juniper and lamplight
I held your hand

And when I awoke and felt you warm and near
I kissed your honey hair with my grateful tears
Oh, I love you, girl
Oh, I love you","For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her"

Simon & Garfunkel,"I hear the drizzle of the rain
Like a memory it falls
Soft and warm continuing
Tapping on my roof and walls

And from the shelter of my mind
Through the window of my eyes
I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets
To England where my heart lies

My mind's distracted and diffused
My thoughts are many miles away
They lie with you when you're asleep
And kiss you when you start your day

And a song I was writing is left undone
I don't know why I spend my time
Writing songs I can't believe
With words that tear and strain to rhyme

And so you see I have come to doubt
All that I once held as true
I stand alone without beliefs
The only truth I know is you

And as I watch the drops of rain
Weave their weary paths and die
I know that I am like the rain
There but for the grace of you go I",Kathy's Song
Simon & Garfunkel,"Last night I had the strangest dream
 I ever dreamed before
 I dreamed the world had all agreed
 To put an end to war
 I dreamed I saw a mighty room
 The room was filled with men
 And the paper they were signing said
 They'd never fight again

 And when the papers all were signed
 And a million copies made
 They all joined hands end bowed their heeds
 And grateful prayers were prayed
 And the people in the streets below
 Were dancing round and round
 And guns and swords and uniforms
 Were scattered on the ground

 I dreamed the world had all agreed
 To put an end to war",Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream

I held her close, but she faded in the night
Like a poem I meant to write.
And the leaves that are green turn to brown,

I threw a pebble in a brook
And watched the ripples run away
And they never made a sound.

He lived all alone within a house,
Within a room, within himself,
A most peculiar man.

He had no friends, he seldom spoke
And no one in turn ever spoke to him,
'Cause he wasn't friendly and he didn't care
And he wasn't like them.
Oh, no! he was a most peculiar man.

He died last Saturday.
He turned on the gas and he went to sleep
With the windows closed so he'd never wake up

Lost in their overcoats, waiting for the sunset
The sounds of the city sifting through trees
Settles like dust on the shoulders of the old friends

Simon & Garfunkel,"The night sets softly
With the hush of falling leaves
Casting shivering shadows
On the houses through the trees
And the light from a street lamp
Paints a pattern on my wall
Like the pieces of a puzzle
Or a child's uneven scrawl

Up a narrow flight of stairs
In a narrow little room
As I lie upon my bed
In the early evening gloom
Impaled on my wall
My eyes can dimly see
The pattern of my life
And the puzzle that is me

From the moment of my birth
To the instant of my death
There are patterns I must follow
Just as I must breathe each breath
Like a rat in a maze
The path before me lies
And the pattern never alters
Until the rat dies

And the pattern still remains
On the wall where darkness fell
And it's fitting that it should
For in darkness I must dwell
Like the color of my skin
Or the day that I grow old
My life is made of patterns
That can scarcely be controlled",Patterns

Simon & Garfunkel,"The last train is nearly due
The underground is closing soon
And in the dark deserted station
Restless in anticipation
A man waits in the shadows

His restless eyes leap and scratch
At all that they can touch or catch
And hidden deep within his pocket
Safe within its silent socket
He holds a colored crayon

Now from the tunnel's stony womb
The carriage rides to meet the groom
And opens wide and welcome doors
But he hesitates, then withdraws
Deeper in the shadows

And the train is gone suddenly
On wheels clicking silently
Like a gently tapping litany
And he holds his crayon rosary
Tighter in his hand

Now from his pocket quick he flashes
The crayon on the wall he slashes
Deep upon the advertising
A single-worded poem comprised of four letters

And his heart is laughing, screaming, pounding
The poem across the tracks rebounding
Shadowed by the exit light
His legs take their ascending flight
To seek the breast of darkness and be suckled by the night, ooh",A Poem on the Underground Wall

With political connections to spread his wealth around.

He had everything a man could want: power, grace, and style.

And I curse my poverty
And I wish that I could be,
Oh, I wish that I could be,

Oh, he surely must be happy with everything he's got.

And I curse the life I'm living
And I curse my poverty

You got to make the morning last
Just kicking down the cobblestones
Looking for fun and feeling groovy

Hello lamppost, what'cha knowing
I've come to watch your flowers growin'
Ain't cha got no rhymes for me?
Doo-ait-n-doo-doo, feeling groovy

Simon & Garfunkel,"Someone told me it's all happening at the zoo

I do believe it
I do believe it's true

It's a light and tumble journey
From the East Side to the park
Just a fine and fancy ramble
To the zoo

But you can take the crosstown bus
If it's raining or it's cold
And the animals will love it if you do
If you do, now

Somethin' tells me it's all happening at the zoo

I do believe it
I do believe it's true

The monkeys stand for honesty
Giraffes are insincere
And the elephants are kindly but they're dumb
Orangutans are skeptical
Of changes in their cages
And the zookeeper is very fond of rum

Zebras are reactionaries
Antelopes are missionaries
Pigeons plot in secrecy
And hamsters turn on frequently
What a gas, you gotta come and see

Got a ticket to my destination
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand
And every stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band
Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home where my thought's escaping
Home where my music's playing
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me

Every day's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines
And each town looks the same to me the movies and the factories
And every stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be

Home where my thought's escaping
Home where my music's playing

Sat on their parkbench like bookends
A newspaper blown through the grass
Falls on the round toes
of the high shoes of the old friends

Old friends, winter companions, the old men
Lost in their overcoats, waiting for the sun
The sounds of the city sifting through trees
Settles like dust on the shoulders of the old friends

Can you imagine us years from today,
Sharing a parkbench quietly
How terribly strange to be seventy

Old friends, memory brushes the same years,
Silently sharing the same fears","Old Friends, Bookends Theme"

Ask me and I will play
So sweetly, I'll make you smile

This is my tune for the taking
Take it, don't turn away

Thinking it over, I'd be more than glad
To change my ways for the asking

Ask me and I will play

Simon & Garfunkel,"I can hear the soft breathing
Of the girl that I love,
As she lies here beside me
Asleep with the night,
And her hair, in a fine mist
Floats on my pillow,
Reflecting the glow
Of the winter moonlight.
She is soft, she is warm,
But my heart remains heavy,
And I watch as her breasts
Gently rise, gently fall,
For I know with the first light of dawn
I'll be leaving,
And tonight will be
All I have left to recall.
Oh, what have I done,
Why have I done it,
I've committed a crime,
I've broken the law.
For twenty-five dollars
And pieces of silver,
I held up and robbed
A hard liquor store.
My life seems unreal,
My crime an illusion,
A scene badly written
In which I must play.
Yet I know as I gaze
At my young love beside me,
The morning is just a few hours away.","Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M."

Simon & Garfunkel,"What a dream I had 
Pressed in organdy 
Clothed in crinoline 
Of smoky burgundy 
Softer than the rain 
I wandered empty streets 
Down past the shop displays 
I heard cathedral bells 
Tripping down the alleyways 
As I walked on 
And when you ran to me 

Your cheeks flushed with the night 
We walked on frosted fields 
Of juniper and lamplight 
I held your hand 
And when I woke 
And felt you warm and near 
I kissed your honey hair 
With my grateful tears 
Oh I love you girl 
Oh I love you","For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her [Live]"
Simon & Garfunkel,"Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together
I've got some real estate here in my bag
So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner's pies
And we walked off to look for America

Michigan seems like a dream to me now
It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
I've gone to look for America

Laughing on the bus, playing games with the faces
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
I said, be careful, his bowtie is really a camera
Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat
We smoked the last one an hour ago
So I looked at the scenery
She read her magazine
And the moon rose over an open field

And I'm empty and aching and I don't know why

Simon & Garfunkel,"The sun is burning in the sky
Strands of clouds go slowly drifting by
In the park the lazy breeze
Are joining in the flowers, among the trees
And the sun burns in the sky

Now the sun is in the West
Little kids go home to take their rest
And the couples in the park
Are holdin' hands and waitin' for the dark
And the sun is in the West

Now the sun is sinking low
Children playin' know it's time to go
High above a spot appears
A little blossom blooms and then draws near
And the sun is sinking low

Now the sun has come to Earth
Shrouded in a mushroom cloud of death
Death comes in a blinding flash
Of hellish heat and leaves a smear of ash
And the sun has come to Earth

Now the sun has disappeared
All is darkness, anger, pain and fear
Twisted, sightless wrecks of men
Go groping on their knees and cry in pain
And the sun has disappeared",The Sun Is Burning [Alt. Take 12] [Alternate Take][#][*]
Simon & Garfunkel,"I'm sitting in the railway station. 
Got a ticket to my destination. 
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand. 
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band. 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Ev'ry day's an endless stream 
Of cigarettes and magazines. 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories 
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,

Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting

I'll play the game and pretend. 
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity 
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.

It's a wonder I can think at all
Though my lack of education hasn't hurt me much
I can read the writings on the walls

Kodachrome, they give us those nice bright colors
They give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day, oh yeah
I got a Nikon camera, I love to take a photograph
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away

If you took all the girls I knew when I was single
Brought 'em all together for one night
I know they'd never match my sweet imagination

Simon & Garfunkel,"A church is burning
The flames rise higher
Like hands that are praying a-glow in the sky
Like hands that are praying the fire is saying, 
""You can burn down my churches but I shall be free.""

Three hooded men through the back road did creep
Torches in their hands while the village lies asleep
Down to the church where just hours before
Voices were singing and hands were beating
And saying I won't be a slave any more.

And a church is burning
The flames rise higher
Like hands that are praying a-glow in the sky
Like hands that are praying the fire is saying,
""You can burn down my churches but I shall be free.""

Three hooded men, their hands lit the spark
Then they faded in the night and they vanished in the dark
And in the cold light of morning there's nothing that remains 
But the ashes of a bible and can of kerosene.

And a church is burning
The flames rise higher
Like hands that are praying a-glow in the sky
Like hands that are praying the fire is saying,
""You can burn down my churches but I shall be free.""

A church is more than just timber and stone
And freedom is a dark road when you're walking it alone
But the future is now, and it's time to take a stand
So the lost bells of freedom can ring out in my land.

Simon & Garfunkel,"I hear the drizzle of the rain
Like a memory it falls
Soft and warm continuing
Tapping on my roof and walls

And from the shelter of my mind
Through the window of my eyes
I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets
To England where my heart lies

My mind's distracted and diffused
My thoughts are many miles away
They lie with you when you're asleep
Kiss you when you start your day

And a song I was writing is left undone
I don't know why I spend my time
Writing songs I can't believe
With words that tear and strain to rhyme

So you see I have come to doubt
All that I once held as true
I stand alone without beliefs
The only truth I know is you

And as I watch the drops of rain
Weave their weary paths and die
I know that I am like the rain
There before the grace of you go I

And the leaves that are green turn to brown,
And they wither with the wind,
And they crumble in your hand.

Once my heart was filled with the love of a girl.
I held her close, but she faded in the night
Like a poem I meant to write.
And the leaves that are green turn to brown,
And they wither with the wind,
And they crumble in your hand.

I threw a pebble in a brook
And watched the ripples run away
And they never made a sound.
And the leaves that are green turned to brown,
And they wither with the wind,
And they crumble in your hand.

Simon & Garfunkel,"He was a most peculiar man.
That's what Mrs. Riordan said and she should know;
She lived upstairs from him
She said he was a most peculiar man.

He was a most peculiar man.
He lived all alone within a house,
Within a room, within himself,
A most peculiar man.

He had no friends, he seldom spoke
And no one in turn ever spoke to him,
'Cause he wasn't friendly and he didn't care
And he wasn't like them.
Oh, no! he was a most peculiar man.

He died last Saturday.
He turned on the gas and he went to sleep
With the windows closed so he'd never wake up
To his silent world and his tiny room;
And Mrs. Riordan says he has a brother somewhere
Who should be notified soon.
And all the people said, ""What a shame that he's dead,
But wasn't he a most peculiar man?""",A Most Peculiar Man [Live]

Sitting on the windowsill
Near the flowers.

We might as well be apart.
It hardly matters,
We sleep separately.

And drop a smile passing in the hall
But there's no laughs left
'Cause we laughed them all.
And we laughed them all
In a very short time.

Is tapping on my forehead,
Hanging from my mirror,
Rattling the teacups,
And I wonder,
How long can I delay?

Simon & Garfunkel,"The last train is nearly due
The underground is closing soon
And in the dark deserted station
Restless in anticipation
A man waits in the shadows

His restless eyes leap and scratch
At all that they can touch or catch
Hidden deep within his pocket
Safe within it’s silent socket
He holds a colored crayon

Now from the tunnel’s stony womb
The carriage rides to meet the groom
And opens wide and welcome doors
But he hesitates, then withdraws
Deeper in the shadows

And the train is gone suddenly
On wheels clicking silently
Like a gently tapping litany
And he holds his crayon rosary
Tighter in his hand

Now from his pocket quick he flashes
The crayon on the wall he slashes
Deep upon the advertising
A single worded poem comprised
Of four letters

And his heart is laughing, screaming, pounding
The poem across the tracks rebounding
Shadowed by the exit light
His legs take their ascending flight
To seek the breast of darkness and be suckled by the night

Simon & Garfunkel,"Time, time time, see what's become of me
While I looked around for my possibilities

I was so hard to please
Don't look around
The leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Hear the Salvation Army band
Down by the riverside's, there's bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned

Carry your cup in your hand
And look around
Leaves are brown, now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Hang on to your hopes, my friend
That's an easy thing to say
But if your hopes should pass away
Simply pretend that you can build them again
Look around
The grass is high
The fields are ripe
It's the springtime of my life

Seasons change with the scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me
At any convenient time?
Funny how my memory skips while looking over manuscripts
Of unpublished rhyme
Drinking my vodka and lime
I look around
Leaves are brown, now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground

Simon & Garfunkel,"A winter's day, in a deep and dark December
I am alone, gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock, I am an island

I've built walls, a fortress deep and mighty that none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship, friendship causes pain
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain
I am a rock, I am an island

Don't talk of love well I've heard the words before
It's sleeping in my memory
And I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died
If I never loved I never would have cried
I am a rock, I am an island

I have my books and my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor, hiding in my room, safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me

Home is where I want to be

Simon & Garfunkel,"What I dream I had:
Pressed in organdy;
Clothed in crinoline of smoky Burgundy;
Softer than the rain.

I wandered empty streets
Down past the shop displays.
I heard cathedral bells
Tripping down the alley ways,
As I walked on.

And when you ran to me
Your cheeks flushed with the night.
We walked on frosted fields of juniper and lamplight,
I held your hand.

And when I awoke and felt you warm and near,
I kissed your honey hair with my grateful tears.
Oh I love you, girl.
Oh, I love you.","For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her [In Concert]"
Simon & Garfunkel,"Old friends
Old friends
Sat on their park bench like bookends
Newspaper blowin' through the grass
Falls on the round toes
Of the high shoes
Of the old friends

Old friends
Winter companions the old men
Lost in their overcoats
Waiting for the sunset
The sounds of the city sifting through trees
Settle like dust
On the shoulders of the old friends

Can you imagine us years from today
Sharing a park bench quietly?
How terribly strange to be seventy

Old friends
Memory brushes the same years
Silently sharing the same fear
A time it was
It was a time
A time of innocence
A time of confidences

Long ago it must be
I have a photograph
Preserve your memories
They're all that's left you",Old Firends
Simon & Garfunkel,"In a vine covered
Shack in the mountains
Bravely fighting
The battle of time
There's a dear one
Who's wept
Through life's sorrows
It's that silver
Haired daddy of mine

If I could recall
All the heartaches
Dear ole daddy
I've caused you to bear
If I could erase
Those lines from your face
And bring back
The gold to your hair
If God would but
Grant me the power
Just to turn back
The pages of time
I would give all
I own just to put a tone
To that silver
Haired daddy of mine",That Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine
Simon & Garfunkel,"The last train is nearly due
The underground is closing soon
And in the dark deserted station
Restless in anticipation
A man waits in the shadows

His restless eyes leap and scratch
At all that they can touch or catch
And hidden deep within his pocket
Safe within its silent socket
He holds a colored crayon

Now from the tunnel's stony womb
The carriage rides to meet the groom
And open wide and welcome doors
But he hesitates, and then withdraws
Deeper in the shadows

And the train is gone suddenly
On wheels clicking silently
Like a gently tapping litany
And he holds his crayon rosary
Tighter in his hand

Now from his pocket quick he flashes
The crayon on the wall he slashes
Deep upon the advertising
A single worded poem consisting
Of four letters

And his heart is laughing, screaming, pounding
The poem across the tracks rebounding
Shadowed by the exit light
His legs take their ascending flight
To seek the breast of darkness and be suckled by the night",A Poem of the Underground Wall [Live]
Simon & Garfunkel,"I'm sitting in the railway station.
Got a ticket to my destination.
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand.
And every stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band.
Homeward bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping,
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.

Every day's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines.
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories
And every stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,
Homeward bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping,
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.

Tonight I'll sing my songs again,
I'll play the game and pretend.
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.
Homeward bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping,
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.

Simon Dawes,"Seven men in a dust bin congress
Standing in a row for final harvest
There's a swinging motion to their shadows
As if the sun above was a pocket watch

Sparrows diving in the whirlwinds arriving
Playing games with floating dead flowers revolving
Those little white darlings like the hard snow falling
On someone just standing over what they've caught

There's always been a deep six waiting right below you
Every time you thought you had tomorrow to wake up to
Now you shut your eyes, don't hold your tears back
As your head gets a hold of what they're giving you
And your legs start folding in twelve different places

And up and down your back you feel the spectators' faces
Hear your slow counting in three slow paces
And your brain shows you pictures of wide open spaces
Where you once shot the rifle your grandfather gave you
At a brand new white wooden water tower

But don't come to me and cry 'May Day'
'Cause it doesn't work that way
But don't come to me and cry  'May Day'
'Cause it doesn't work that way

I'm sure you didn't get a chance to see it
But those scruffy boys from our country pockets
Had a mean case of jitters that could
Shake the name off God above

And this is where you learn to talk in secrets
Where the guilt's so dry and the sweat is helpless
When they say, ""You know this is for what he did""
But it just isn't good enough

Well, I've seen karma and his ball dropping
I've seen life and its clever ways of stopping
I've seen people chase dreams until the dream's forgotten
And I've seen a killer with a heavy heart

When the trigger can just be made of plastic
And the blood can just be something that ruined the fabric
On the uniform that you could just burn with matches
But your eyes fall shut as reality disquiets

And you finally know that what has happened today
Is going to be a part of you
And this better be a big pay day
But it doesn't look that way

Simon Dunmore,"You say you're lonely
Don't care anymore
Emptiness abounds
and love surrounds
the hole besides your heart

You're feeling so sad,
And it's never been this bad..before
Don't wanna change the world
But I'm gonna change your mind
I'll only say that if you stay
Love is what you'll find
But you're gone, 'cause love takes so long

You say you're empty
Don't feel anymore
Loneliness abounds
And the music pounds around and around and around

You're moving way too fast
Like nothing ever lasts
Just keep on, pushing
Could be anything you want
Could do anything you feel
Love is all around you
But you don't believe it's real
Just be fearless
Baby be fearless

Do it now
Do it now
Do it now
Do it now

All my life
I sit and wonder
Why you put yourself down
What's so bad, what's so bad, what's so bad, what's so bad
About what we have now?
Raise your hands, in the twilight
Raise your hands, to the sky

And say I love you
No fear anymore
Happiness is found
Let love come down
and shine inside your heart
You're beautiful inside
I'm in love with your mind and your heart and your soul and your eyes
Could be anything you want
Could do anything you feel
Love is all around you
But you don't believe it's real
Open up your mind
Listen to your heart
Leave loneliness behind
Come on, come on, come on

Or troubled by some foolish game

She's around me now

And if I'm well you can tell she's been with me now
She's been with me now quite a long, long time
And I feel fine

And I find myself careening
In places where I should not let me go
She has the power to go where no one else can find me
Yes and silently remind me
The happiness and the good times that I know, but as I had got to know them

It isn't what she's got to say
But how she thinks and where she's been
To me, the words are nice, the way they sound
I like to hear them best that way
It doesn't much matter what they mean
What she says them mostly just to calm me down

And I feel fine anytime she's around me now

Like I was a distant city 

Winter came and swept away 
The birds nest from my chimney 
The cold air marched right through the walls 
And settled her in my belly 
But her memory keeps me tossing 
Those letters into the fire 
And the flames they're twitching

Now New York is not a place I'd choose 
To have my body buried 
But Omaha has got the trains to take

Simon Nicol,"When I was young I spoke like a child, and I saw with a child's eyes
And an open door was to a girl like the stars are to the sky
It's funny how the world lives up to all your expectations
With adventures for the stout of heart, and the lure of the open spaces

There's 2 lanes running down this road, whichever side you're on
Accounts for where you want to go, or what you're running from
Back when darkness overtook me on a blind man's curve

I relied upon the moon, I relied upon the moon
I relied upon the moon and Saint Christopher
Now I've paid my dues cuz I have owed them, but I've paid a price sometimes
For being such a stubborn woman in such stubborn times

Now I've paid my dues cuz I have owed them, but I've paid a price sometimes
For being such a stubborn woman in such stubborn times
Now I have run from the arms of lovers, I've run from the eyes of friends
I have run from the hands of kindness, I've run just because I can

But now I'm grown and I speak like a woman and I see with a woman's eyes
And an open door is to me now like the saddest of goodbyes
It's too late for turning back, I pray for the heart and the nerve

And I rely upon the moon, I rely upon the moon

Simon Petit,"Le sommeil s’achève
La lumière se faufile jusqu’à mes yeux
Et soudain je me rappelle
Que la vie comme hier ne va pas mieux

Et tout le reste s'enchaîne
Les défaites, la solitude dans mon lit
La mémoire est cruelle
Elle devrait supprimer tous les ennuis

Ohhh...

La journée se fait longue
Comme les autres d‘ailleurs depuis quelque temps
J’aimerais te dire que je me rappelle
Que des moments les plus éclatants

Mais tout le reste s'emmêle
Les pleurs reviennent me hanter dans mes nuits
La mémoire est cruelle
Elle devrait ne garder que les sourires

Ohhh....

Ne t’en fais pas je resterai seul encore un peu
J’aurai épuisé ma haine
J’aurai compris alors
Que j’ai perdu mon temps...
Que j’ai perdu mon temps...

Something isn't there,

Someone to make my life an adventurous dream
Oh, what wouldn't I give for 
Someone who'd take my life 
And make it seem gay as they say it ought to be.
Why can't I have love like that brought to me?

Simon Raymonde,"It's 4 o'clock in the morning
I've seen the man in the moon
I've seen things, I couldn't have dreamed of
I wished that you would come soon
And I know, when rainbow clouds open
I'll be the one on the moon
It's a kind of curious assumption
To think I understand you

[Chorus]
Should I stand back and watch
As you continue to argue all night
Maybe this is my role in life
But don't you worry yourself cause it's alright
If I knew what to say
Just like today when we were discussing the weather
I could want her amour
More of those days when we could be laughing together

It's time for quiet contemplation
Just like those men on the moon
No sense in thinking it over
Cause one and one should make
It's a kind of curious assumption
To think I understand you

If I kissed you like this
I know god exists
And what I was hoping to find here
Hold that thought in your head
If something I said
Could give you the wrong impression

Simon Says,"You let your guard down once again
I took advantage, broke the skin
I watched it fall apart
I witnessed it all decay

You'll beg to be a part of it
You'll cry when you can't handle it
You'll make the same mistake
They all made one day

I know
Bring that to me
Shut your mouth

You wear the scars and bruises well
When will the cuts and scratches heal?
When does the price you pay to play outweigh the play?
Before your finger points to me

Remember ""Who inspired me""
And shove your fucking borrowed selfish identity
You think it's all just a game
Try not to lose to his face

But have you ever seen what it can do?
You'll fill it up till it bursts
It starves the sick but still hurts
You think that your life means something to me?

I know
Bring that to me
Shut your mouth

Your life means nothing at all to me
I'll break your innocent smile at the seam
You think there is never a price to pay
You've already made the same mistake

This is my life
This is my life
So here we are

You though you'd enjoy all the fame
But now we're laughing
You'll never be, no, you'll never be the same
You think it's all just a game

Try not to lose to his face
But have you ever seen what it can do?
You'll fill it up till it bursts
It starves the sick but still hurts
You think that your life means something?

I know
Bring that to me
Fuck you all

Your life means nothing at all to me
I'll break your innocent smile at the seam
You think there is never a price to pay

Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting

And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories
And every stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,

Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.

Why did I leave her alone tonight?

There in the breakers I saw her near;
Reached for my darlin', held her to me,
Stole her away from the angry sea.

Will you screw up in the process of
Addiction to you
All the words being spoken
I've said them all before
Staring into my eyes I realize
I'm not here anymore- cause
There's addiction- there's addiction
In all you do
There's addiction- there's addiction
In all those things we do
But I'm through
How many times will I break the bottle
In addiction to you
How many nights
Will I say things I don't want to
In affliction for you
And how many hearts will be broken
By using you- using you
And how many heads
Will you screw up in the process of
Addiction to you
All the lines I've spoken
For I ain't said the last
Staring up at my face
I'll leave not a trace
Of powder on the glass
There's addiction
You are my heroine
You always let me in
You are a sweet red wine
So call me cause I can't give up
I'm shooting in the dark
I'm running and I can't give up
I'm wet you're wet go get
There's addiction in all you do",Addiction
Simon Townshend,"There's on line
That each time said will capture you
As I pine in my wine
I may feel it's true
Said so easily but meant casually
At one time I said I'm in love with you
It's a fine way
To treat a lady I've just meet
Feeling is written in her eyes
With me just desperate
So sad as I plea but still running free
I might say that I may be in love with you
Maybe it's rough
But I'm feeling rough
I'm sorry for the plans you made
I'm sorry I just had you laid
I said sorry but I do think
Everything that you think
But I'm not the kind to stay
So I must say
Sorry for the hurt in you
I'm sorry for what I must do
I said sorry if I knew how
Everything would turn out
Sorry for those things I said
Just to get you in my bed
I'm so sorry I'm so sorry
And to you I gave every drop I had
I woo you as you chew through
Hours ending sad
But in my way I'll mean it when I say
The one line that each time said
Will capture you
And I know it may seem tough
But I'm full of stuff
I said sorry for the plans you made
I'm sorry I just had you laid
I said sorry but I do think
Everything that you think
But I'm not the kind to stay
So I must say
Sorry for the hurt in you
So sorry for what I must do
I say sorry my burning loads me
Sorry my guilt explodes me
Sorry my heart erodes me
I'm sorry for those things I said
Just to get you in my bed
I'm sorry I'm sorry

Simon Townshend,"Looking in the mirror, what do I see but me?
Trying to forget her it was never meant to be
And that's not clever, cause she didn't mean a thing
The morning after what do I see, tell me what do I see
No wonder I feel wasted, I did it to myself
No wonder I've been losing sleep
With the company I keep
Looking in the mirror eyes blood shot and sore
Trying to remember was it me or was it her
Sitting in the traffic feeling such a fake
And all this panic cause I made a mistake, tell me what can I say
No wonder I feel cheated, I did it to myself
No wonder I've been losing sleep
No wonder I feel wasted
I did it to myself
No wonder I've been losing sleep with the company I keep
Oh, gonna make you see, need your company
Oh, gonna make you see, need your company
Oh, gonna make you see, need your company
Need your company
Saw my reflection in the window of a store,
Got no price tag, I've been used and worn
And that's not clever 'cause she wasn't worth a damn
Now only my conscience knows who I am

Simon Webbe,"Sometimes life can be a burden
Tryna stay one step ahead
I feel the world upon my shoulders each time
I'm standing out on the edge
And my hopes have all deserted me
Like they washed away in the sand

But I know I stand a chance

When you lay your hands, oh yeah
'Cause it's the only thing I have
That still makes sense

(Oh baby, when I'm calling out)
Give me love and affection
Keep telling me, show me the way

Lift me up from the shadows
Will you take me away to a better place
(And when I'm in my darkest hour)
You're by my side to turn the tide
Until the suffering fades
When life is getting me down, getting me down
I'm close to defeat
Come and lay your hands on me

Feel this road is getting longer now
And I'm too far away from home
Still I gotta keep on moving on
But I can't do it on my own

Baby, keep my head above water
Help me swim for my life
'Cause the game is getting harder
The strain is getting stronger
And I can only face the fight

When you lay your hands, oh yeah

No sign of healing, it's all right
She's loving him still, after all this time.

Oh yeah

Trying to push the past away
Still waiting for the lights to change
Try, try for the sake of it
Learning to barely feel the pain
Thicker the skin the less the strain
And though it's really hurting
She ain't breaking, breaking, breaking
Coz she's loving him still, after all this time

Now he knows his weakness shows
Selfish soul, never changing
That's fine, because she's loving him still
After all this time

And to the outside eye
You see you found a different guy
And it all seems perfect, and that's how she wants it
Coz she's loving him still, after all this time.

Trying to push the past away
Still waiting for the lights to change
Try, try for the sake of it
Learning to barely feel the pain
Thicker the skin the less the strain
And though it's really hurting
She ain't breaking, breaking, breaking
Coz she's loving him still, after all this time

After all this time
After all, after all, after all this time

Bones have to grow, and age it shows
Though we try and hide it
Inside, she's loving him still
After all this time
And behind his tired eyes, she sees the boy with his arms wide

Who made her feel like an angel
Oh that's why she's loving him still
For the rest of her life, she's loving him still
For the last of many miles
She's loving him still

So many people hurting

To make everything okay

How we got here
But I reach inside
And the answer's clear

It can right the wrong
Can take the blame

Nothin' more we need
Cause it's all inside

Til everybody knows
Only love can understand
Only love can bring us together again

and it seems since time began
That people just been fightin'
And it ain't just black or white
And it ain't just wrong or right
And I get so overwhelmed
So disconnected
Til you reach out to me
You know just what I need

as long as I
Can hold you near
It's gonna be alright
Won't have no fear

I pray for peace to shine on you and me
I pray for strength, hope and faith
For love to lead the way

Something you got put it on me
Guess I ain't going anywhere

well we could talk a little
Laugh a while and maybe
Talk a little more

No, no, that ain't gonna bother me,

Cold cash, got you like a sedative,

While somehow, I'm sleeping with the enemy,

You'll get none of that money making lies,
You can't bare to do better thinking twice,
If you're taking me on, you're doing it all wrong yeah,
And where d'ya get that attitude from?

I thought that I was seeing something else,
Something sweeter, nothing like the rest,
But you were trouble dressed as tenderness,
'cause this deception that you played on me,
Has left you where you didn't wanna be,
But don't come knockin' here for sympathy,

Yours were the words that I won't forget,
Mine are the ones that I won't regret,
Made me feel good and I told you that,

This is not like you, it's not the friend I'm used to, so we're gonna get you through oh

Let memories touch your soul, of all your deepest hopes, oh

Though you say you're just the same, well you know it ain't so
Oh deny it all you can, but you don't wanna be that man

Nobody's to blame, just like when leaves fall
Scattered dry and left to wonder the reason for it all

In time we all get older wiser learning as we go
Where's the friend I knew, the one I used to turn to, here's what you gotta do oh

(That man) who's letting life go by through an empty glass

Simon Webbe,"GO TO SLEEP

The light is fading it's the end of the day, she's lying awake,
Wondering if tomorrow's gonna be her friend,
She's too young to understand but knows something's wrong,
Now mama has gone, and daddy's doing all that he can to recompense,

BRIDGE 1
And out of these lonely days, she's trying to make the most,
This unfamiliar place, she's trying to make it home,
She's working hard to get the kind of love her mama gave, oh


(Go to sleep my little baby)
Go to sleep my little baby,
(Go to sleep my little baby)
Go to sleep my little baby,
Your mama's gone away and your daddy's gonna stay,
Don't leave nobody but the babe,


She takes the pressure and she hides it away,
Still wakes everyday, and always sets the table for an extra place,

BRIDGE 2
This ain't what she chose, this is what she's got,
Hope that when she grows old, no one needs to pay the cost,
She's working hard to be the kind of girl her mama was, oh

In a world that doesn't sleep at all
You give me (grace)
It's a place I've never been before
You give me (grace)
And in all of the confusion you're the peace in my soul
That's why I will never really be alone

Suddenly, I'm up on the surface now where I can see
And picture the person who I need to be
And I know, yes I know I can make it
See me now, I'm slowly rising up

Well yeah, these are difficult times
These are difficult days
But I know we can face it

I know for certain you're the one, yeh
So close I get, still no cigar

I can't stop the rain from falling down on me, oh no no
I know I'm not what you want
I'm hoping in time you'll see how
My soul pleads for you

Not every time you meet someone and
You both just click in a minute
Baby it's the eye contact, smile like that
Click click and you're rolling
Can't stop calling you, I don't know what to do
Baby you're making me break down all of my rules, yeh

I can't stop the river from running, (I can't stop the river from running)
I can't stop the rain from falling down on me, oh no no

Oh it's the way it seems, I can't keep you out my dreams
Oh I get chills baby, when I can't talk to you
I'm in pain and I hope you feel the way I do

Simon Webbe,"Seventeen, I was living life
Chasing dreams and my hopes were high
Trying to get around my fear of
When and where do I go from here

I asked somebody close to me
Who could see a lot further than a boy could see
Oh, oh, oh and he said

Oh my, oh my, oh my these days are flying by
I still feel seventeen inside, not one day over
Don't let the trials of life, change who you are tonight
Stay seventeen each time you get one year older

I said you're at that time of life when your heart is strong
Your future's bright, you can do no wrong
And don't you let those feelings out of sight
Keep a hold of them as the years go rolling by

These words have always stuck with me
But now I'm only getting what it all appears to mean
Oh, oh, oh and he said

Oh my, oh my, oh my these days are flying by
I still feel seventeen inside, not one day over
Don't let the trials of life, change who you are tonight
Stay seventeen each time you get one year older

He said, my years have come and gone, in oh such little time
And I hope you live your life the way that I lived mine
Stay young at heart, stay young in mind

So I said

Oh my, oh my, oh my these days are flying by
I'm still seventeen inside, not one day over
I won't let the trials of life, change who I am tonight

Simon Webbe,"It's one of those time, when you know what to stay

I just know, gotta get, from my heart to my head, got the words on my breath right now

A love like that, a love like that

Everybody's searching, trying so hard to find
Some kind of an angel, who can share their whole lives

I didn't make enough cheese
I couldn't figure out my wrongs and I found it hard to breathe

Feels like my world is coming down

Simon Webbe,"(Na na na na na na...)

Some day's I don't know how I got here
It's been a journey through the dark
I've lived the live that and no answers
The truth was always in my heart
I've spent a coin to make decisions
And still I always got it wrong
Try to AVOID HELD ON collision
The Jeans WAS DEEP AND NOW IT'S GONE

So I say uh uh uh
That's the way it goes
I've lived to find another day
And I...uh uh uh uh uh
That's the way it goes
Life Is a game we have to play
Play on...

It's like a book that has no ending
It's like a story never told
It's like a night when your own fire
Why Goes the morning feel so cold?
Feels like I'm trapped inside a circle
AND though I plan my great escape
IT'S like come back AT where I've started
The only thing I have is space

Play on...

Oh, you know we have to play

Simone,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love but there's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me

Simone White,"They're always writing songs about a summer love
That never seems to last beyond the fall
But I've a different reason for crying this season
A reason that can hurt you most of all

I didn't have any summer romance
Nobody bothered to break my heart in two
While others were fooled by the sweet words
Someone vowed I was the one who made company a crowd

I didn't walk down the beach in a trance
Or listened to little white lies that sounded true
And no one could be as blue as I was in the fall
'Cause I didn't have any summer romance at all

And no one could be as blue as I was in the fall
'Cause I didn't have any summer romance at all

",I Didn't Have Any Summer Romance

I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye

 Get your own lingo, make up your own jingle 
 Ten years later you be bitin my single

 Catch the vibe like a tribal dance

 Tell him, 'Step off, I'm doin the Hump'

 I say it's my world, and I won't stop 
 and if you stand in my way you bound to get dropped 
 Some wish that I was gone cause they know I'ma win 
 In a minute I 'll be makin six G's times ten 
 I'm the computer, printin out data take notes 
 then analyze the information and press send 
 Freaky like porno, Ron Jeremy saw no 
 obstacle or pussy to stop him from bonin a hoe

 Chicks look at us like twins, all lovable and huggable 
 Prognosis, on the, mic I choke out 
 Had the same effects from coughin blowin smoke out 
 Architect, rap technician, man listen 
 It's no doubt you gonna pump this in your system 
 My skills ill, and all of that above 
 Confidence, I'm not worried bout a street buzz 
 I'm O.C., who you? I never heard of ya 
 Get out my face 'fore I turn into a motherfuckin murderer 
 I want the green like indo, a mansion, a car 
 A wife who's never been a bimbo 
 Too much to ask well to me that's simple 
 want to retire on a yacht called the S. S. Minnow 
 I say it's my world, and I won't stop 
 And if you stand in my way, you bound to get dropped 
 (repeat 4X) 
 Top choice, this here nigga got poise 
 Ain't a man alive who could stop my noise 
 I snatch a star from the sky, spark up your lye 
 You stand astounded wonderin how I did it 
 Now you're star struck, like I truck gold 
 Treatin me like a nigga havin a million records sold 
 Now a starchild, phenmonen like the X-Files 
 Rappers know I'm comin so they go in exile 
 Czar in this rap shit, comin on your mattress 
 Microphone fiend I make beats do backflips 
 Fear me like genocide, serious 
 How I do it through your stereo, mysterious 
 O.C. do demolition, nil competition 
 Like robot Kong on a destroy mission 
 A matter of life and death you try to fight for breath 
 I snatch your heart from a slice through your chest 
 Who the best, from New York to Bogota 
 Who got face thinkin they scare me with a scar, shit 
 What I be bringin is a terrible sight 
 A performance never again performed on the mic 
 I say it's my world, and I won't stop 
 And if you stand in my way, you bound to get dropped

Don't want to speak to no fool

For I've got to find the jewels
I have some precious momements
Into the night I stare
To dream of something special
Ooh Another sad affair

When all your trust
Turns to dust
And you're lost for words to say
You've got so much more to see before
You turn to walk away
Listen to a world of your own
You've got to leave me alone.

Simple Minds,"Chased you out of this world, didn't mean to stop
I turned around and suddenly you where gone
Like some bird from paradise, the fire and ice
We turned around and suddenly you where gone, gone, gone
And now summer burns a hole inside and years are golden once again
My thoughts return to you my dear young friend

Oh come this way
Will you look down this way
I go down on the street
Where the wild wind's blowing
Here comes a hurricane

I say come down this way
Will you look down this way
I need you tonight
I need you around me

I'm looking through the windows
And my mind goes in a whirl
Well there's a multitude of candles
Burning in the windows of this world
I'm looking at the colours
Checking out the straights
I'm counting out the numbers
Will tomorrow never change?

Still I hear you and I love you
And I'll follow you elsewhere
And I'll remember this occasion
I'll remember being aware

'Cause we've got panic in the evening
We've got fall-out in the streets
And I hear you and I follow you
And I'll call out and I'll say
That I can hear your sister call out
And I hear her call your name
They're calling sweet surrender
And things won't be the same
And don't you think that I don't care
And don't you think that I don't know
And don't you hear them calling out
In a place not far from here

And I hear big wheels are turning
Some things are not to fear
They say this is the time and place
They call street fighting years

And I hear great wheels are turning
And I tell you not to fear
They say this is the time and place
They call street fighting years

And I love you, I look for you
And I walk to you, I walk to you
And I hear big wheels are turning
Is there no way out of here?
They'll be calling out tomorrow

Don't you know it's rumoured all around
Says you know it's come to town
Come on and take a step back to the middle of the track

You come and never blink an eye

Don't tell me it's a bad dream
Don't tell me it's not what it seems

Building mansions on the hillside next to you
In the city souls awaken bodies shaking

And to the hungry in the gutter
We've deprived them bread and butter

It's the devil with his chainsaw
And I'll be running through the ghettos
Through the townships of Soweto

They've got worries they've got troubles on their mind
And when you hear them reaching out
They're reaching out for something they can't find

Oh I believe one great day the rain will come
And wash this mess away
Oh I believe one great day the rain will come

They've got silver and diamonds
They've got paradise around them
They've got blue skies so clear
They've got their prisoner in a wagon
While the children chase the dragon
And the free bird files so clear
It files away
Fly fly fly away
Fly away
Oh you fly away

And may your sweet lips sing to me
Let the bells ring wherever freedom be
One babe is born and another one dies
There's people making love tonight
People making love tonight

In France a skinny man
Died of a big disease with a litte name
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle
And soon she did the same
At homethere are seventeen-year-old boys
And their idea of fun
Is being in a gang called The Disciples
High on crack, totin' a machine gun

Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling off a church
And killed everyone inside
You turn on the telly and every other story
Is tellin' you somebody died

And we're sending people to the moon
In September my cousin tried Reefer for the very first time
Now he's doing Horse, it's June

And everybody still wants to fly

Will anybody see the dawn

",Love Song [Extended]
Simple Minds,"Ever felt that you've been lied and somehow you just can't provide the proof
Ever felt you've cast aside and sheltered from the universal truth
Ever find when trouble calls you're first in line and stick your finger in
Everybody's talking about 7 deadly sins

Number one says drop the gun there's nothnig out there that's worth dying for 
And number two, that's me and you, I'm green inside and jealous to the core 
Number three fidelity, I've lost the path and I'd better start again
This thing's got a strange mystique, the 7 deadly sins
This thing's got the whole world beat, 7 deadly sins

I can hear them calling out, I can hear them screaming out
Blood is sweet like a deep river and where it goes I don't know
You make me sweat and you make me shiver, where it goes I don't know

If you've got sticky fingers, you got dreams that linger running through your 
brain
Well vanity's the flying ""V"", desire is the one who gets the blame
If you're looking for a goldmine when all around you seems to be tin
I'm not superstitious about 7 deadly sins
I can hear them calling out, I can hear them screaming out
Blood is sweet like a deep river and where it goes I don't know
You make me sweat and you make me shiver, where it goes I don't know

Everybody's calling out 7 deadly sins
Everybody's dreaming about 7 deadly sins
",7 Deadly Sins
Simple Minds,"Sweetest angel came down
Took me by the hand
Said I've got things to offer you
Help you understand
If the bombs don't get you
I'll roll with you tonight
All these things inside your head
You've got to get it right
And the band played on

Spirits of the city
Were calling out my name
When jealous guys break down and cry
They got themselves to blame
If the bombs don't get you
Take courage in the night
All those dreams inside your head
You've got to get it right

Still the band played on
And the band played on

The room was getting hotter
And someone hit the light
There was power in the darkness
There was violence in the night
And the golden sons and daughters
They were coming up for air
You were standing with your back to me
And a halo round your hair

And the questions there were many
Like how can you survive
When it's the moment
You've been waiting for
This is the moment of your life

So every dreamer pass me by
With a fix me Jesus stare in his eyes
I was born to live
I was born to die
With the queen of soul
And the king of light
All the power in the land
Pull me through to the shadowland
I was driven by some hidden hand
It's the greatest gift of all

And the band played on

Shake the ghost within you
Get up, meet up, the rising sun
'cause the old days they're the dying days
And the new day's just begun
At the end of every party
Hear the singer sing his song
May his heart stay young forever
And the dream still lingers on

I want to die
I want to live again
I want to keep on keeping on
They say a coward dies a thousand times
But the brave they die just once

So walk to me, talk to me
Hold me now spectre of love
There's a coolness under fire
And a universal love

And the band played on
Played on, played on

Simple Minds,"I look for the answer
I look for the light
I walk on every highway
Still I need you tonight

So let it be love
Lonely love
Let it be love
It's a criminal world

It hits like a bullet
It screams and it hurts
Is it my fascination
Or does love come inspired

Don't hand me down, don't push me down
Don't leave me lying on the frozen ground
You can shelter me with your sweet action
This world is splitting up and it's a chain reaction

It's a criminal world

You move like a vampire
Risen from dust
Is it my fascination

Don't hand me down, don't push me down
Don't leave me lying on the frozen ground
You can shelter me with your sweet action
This world is splitting up and it's a chain reaction
And when you point me to another place
I can turn my back upon this wilderness
And I'll step inside
Step inside
And find you waiting on the other side

It's a criminal world",Criminal World
Simple Minds,"I jumped up like Apollo
Crash landed on my feet
The sun shot like a laser through my brain
A little death had woken up
And put a curse on me
But I knew that that I'd be coming back again
Inspiration, across the nation
There's a poverty of expectation
All I got to do was move ahead 
It's a blue sky
It's a while cloud
It's a flame
It's a blue sky
White cloud
Burning flame 
I shot back to the mirror
There was nothing left to see
But a phantom with his heartbeat deep inside
I could feel the dust of ages
They were blowing back at me
But I knew that I was born to get it right 
Everybody take the great leap forward
Everybody knows the mysteries at hand
If you've been praying all those sweet days for this
Don't you know there is a whole different plan
Sometimes I hear the madman calling
He talks about some dark eternal place
I've been waiting all my lifetime for this moment
And now I've got to find some other ways 
One touch ignites this eagle
One kiss for heavens view
I need the flame so I can feel alive
You can tell my little brother
No requiem for me
I knew that I was born to make this flight 
Inspiration across the nation
There's a poverty of expectation
All I got to do was move ahead
",Great Leap Forward
Simple Minds,"I can feel it in the darkness, getting closer in the night
Like a sacred song, you linger on, you give me the wings of flight
And I love your sense of power, every hour, every need
When the red light shows, your arms enclose like the pillars of destiny

With one step forward, I know I can leave this behind
Never look backward, I want to move through space through time
I want to get to it seek and you'll find check the world do it
It's my life
There's a star, shines over you and I
It's my life I'm just
Keeping my soul alive

There's talk of revolution, there's no solution to our plight
A red guitar can get you far but you still know how to fight
They say all roads come together, every shoulder to the the wheel
Solid gold future unfolds when you give me the hands that heal

With one step forward, I know I can leave this behind
Never look backward, I want to move through space through time
I want to get to it seek and you'll find check the world do it
It's my life
There's a star, shines over you and I
It's my life I'm just
Keeping my soul alive

I'm looking out and I call your name I go running in a circle
But I can't get back again and I'm calling I need you here
My whole life took a tumble and I'm so filled up with fear
My life feels like a runaway train I'm leading through a tunnel
And I can't get back again

It's my life 
With one step forward, I know I can leave this behind
Never look backward, I want to move through space through time

Simple Minds,"Can you here the lone night music coming in so near
When I hear the lone night music
Every nightmare crumbles and they disappear
And you hear the echoes calling, speaking in verse
When I hear the lone night music
Everything gets stronger and I lose this curse

Help me break the chains that hold me from the truth
I want to feel the hands that raise me from a low down level
To the highest roof, woh oh
Night music, I hear it now night music

I want to catch the rock that's falling, roll it back up hill
When I hear the strange night music
The whole world's turning and I'm still standing 
Still I feel it growing deep inside me, still I'm at a loss
When I hear the lone night music
It's a warning signal there's a bridge to cross

(The time and place to cure your bitter heart)
Feels like running water, water of the soul
Spinning like a spinning wheel, way beyond control
Spinning like a spinning wheel, way beyond control

Can you hear the lone night music coming in so far 
When I hear the lone night music
It's a lonely planet, it's a burning star
I want to swin the widest ocean, diving in so deep
When I hear the lone night music
I can get so blue that I just can't sleep
Sing to me, oh night music, coming in so near

There's something you should know
I just found my new direction
And I hope you like the key
Like the air that led me to it
She's like the wind that sucked me through it
She's a river and she's turning there in front of me

Stand back, get back
She'll paint your blue skies black
She gives bullet proof protection

So take me on that freedom ride

Meet me on the staircase
Outside a darkened room
Light me like a naked flame
The voice of mother nature states
All things must pass
And nothing can remain
They say that every heaven's got a thousand rooms
So take me on that freedom ride

You raise me like a building to the very top
Rush me to the end of time

And we're changing our ways, taking different roads

About our faith and love
I see it in your faces thin as shadow
See me as I figure in your late night plan
See me as I'm cocooned up in badland
The side effects of cruising at the speed of life
The side effects of living in temptation
When only one star is waiting up on all of us

And do I get to see the light of day

I need somewhere to go
I need you

Fighting all night

Well be just fine this time

Without you I go through the motions
Without you its just not quite the same
Without you I don't want to go out
I just want to say

I'll let you be right

For every lesson that you have to learn.

I'll make you a career in the business I'm in.
I'll make you rich, I'll make you a toy,
I'll make you turn over into my little boy.
Y'see I'm going somewhere.
I don't know what I'm gonna do when I get there.

I know money's a thing - your only inspiration
And your only meaning.
You must think that all I do
Is spend my time making pretty pictures of you.
You can fall when I will climb,
But I'll be falling over just by having you in mind.

Mend that fight - oh listen to them
Kickin' up a ball inside a Jericho wall.
Mend that fight - it's all twisted through them.
If you ain't rich then you won't go to the ball.

Having mercy and licking up love,
And moving through your ocean like I've never had enough.
Y'see you ain't all I want,
You're everything and more that I have ever hoped for.
You must think that all I do
Is spend my time making pretty pictures of you.
You can fall when I will climb,
But I'll be falling over just by having you in mind.

Mend that fight - oh listen to them
Kickin' up a ball inside a Jericho wall.
Mend that fight - it's all twisted through them.

You won't go to the ball.
You won't go, you won't go,
You won't go to the ball.
You won't go to the ball.
You won't go to the ball.
You won't go, you won't go,
You won't go to the ball.

You must think that all I do
Is spend my time making pretty pictures of you.
You can fall when I will climb,
But I'll be falling over just by having you in mind.

Mend that fight - oh listen to them
Kickin' up a ball inside a No.10 wall.
Mend that fight - it's all twisted through them.
I'm rich, you ain't, so you won't go to the ball
No more!

You won't go to the ball.
You won't go to the ball.
You won't go, you won't go,
You won't go to the ball.
 
Yeah, if you ain't got nothing
You'll never go there
Yeah, if you ain't got nothing
You'll never go there
I tried to make you see
I tell you, I'd had enough.

Money was a thing that I believed in.

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Something Got Me Started (Live at Bournemouth Bic 7/11/05)

Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

Beg you for relief when it's my turn
Help me to help you help me learn

But don't blame me if your life sheds a tear

The feverish time we spend alone it soothes me
But too many days spent apart alone they just confuse me
Part of being a lady you love it when I miss you more
And without pontificating its you I'm adorin'

Tienes todo lo que el alma necesita, 
Sin tu Luna llena que me justifica, me hundo.

Como me haré falta tu pensamiento, 
Cuando una noche larga me tiene preso, 
Cuando en la madrugada me siento lejos, 
Tu cuerpo me salva del frío del alba. 
Toda la magia que quiero encontrar en tu cuerpo yo siempre la encuentro, 
Toda la luz que ilumina mis días proviene de tus sentimientos, 
Toda la fe que me salva y el amor que da la calma, 
Todos los caminos que me acercan a mi alma.

Nadie que me mira, como miras tu 
Nadie que me llene de tanta quietud 
Nadie que me prenda fuego que haga de la vida un juego 
Lleno de sonrisas nadie como tu 
Eres la única manera de sobrevivir 
Eres el camino que quiero seguir 
Llevas en tus manos lo que me haré marchar 
Ya no extraño ni me engaño si tu estas aquí 

Women are the magic in the world,(si estas aqui) 
Women have the magic in the world,(por converti en alegri todo su dolor)

Para llenar mi corazón es suficiente con tu voz,
Todo lo que hay en tu interior, yo lo quiero.

Todo lo que me das, me haré amarte más

Que se da de pronto
En forma natural
Lleno de fuego

De cine de romances solo falsas ilusiones

Millones de habitantes que van día con día
Ignorándose hacia delante
Y después no sé porqué
Porqué, quién sabe cómo
Después no sé porqué
Porqué quien sabe cómo
Dos almas de repente se generan un destino
Palacios, ruido, smog son como un jardín divino
Personas entregadas intercambian un anillo
En un departamento que sera como un castillo

Que no podré aguantar
Si clavas tu mirada
Que me hiela el cuerpo
Me a pasado antes
Que no puedo hablar

Tal vez pienses que estoy loco
Y es verdad un poco
Tengo que aceptar
Pero si no te explico
Lo que siento dentro
No vas a entender
Cuando me veas llorar

Nunca me sentí tan solo
Como cuando ayer
De pronto lo entendí
Mientras callaba
La vida me dijo a gritos
Que nunca te tuve y nunca te perdí
Y me explicaba que
El amor es una cosa
Que se da de pronto
En forma natural
Lleno de fuego
Si lo fuerzas se marchita
Sin tener principio
Llega a su final.

Ahora tal vez lo puedas entender
Que si me tocas se quema mi piel
Ahora tal vez lo puedas entender
Y no te vuelvas si no quieres ver

Que lloro por ti
Que lloro sin ti
Que ya lo entendí
Que no eres para mí
Y lloro

Nunca me sentí tan solo
Como cuando ayer
De pronto lo entendí
Mientras callaba
La vida me dijo a gritos
Que nunca te tuve y nunca te perdí
Y me explicaba que
El amor es una cosa
Que se da de pronto
En forma natural
Lleno de fuego
Si lo fuerzas se marchita
Sin tener principio
Llega a su final.

Ahora tal vez lo puedas entiender
Que si me tocas se quema mi piel
Ahora tal vez lo puedas entender
Y no te vuelvas si no quieres ver

Que lloro por ti
Que lloro sin ti
Que ya lo entendí
Que no eres para mí
Y lloro

Que lloro por ti
Que lloro sin ti
Que ya lo entendí
Que no eres para mí
Y lloro",Que Lloro [Stereo 2.0][Multimedia Track]
Sin Bandera,"(Junto a ti, la palabra imposible no existe en mi vida,Vico see, Sin Bandera)

Junto a ti, yo quiero estar contigo
Quiero ser, un poco más que amigo
Despertar, contigo en la mañana
Tú en mí, why el mar en la ventana.

Eres tú, como la noche bella
En tu piel, habitan las estrellas
Navegar, tu boca cada tarde
De pensar, nada más, mi cuerpo ya me arde.

Quiero encontrarme contigo el camino que lleva al hotel del amor,
Ya sé lo que soy, ya sé donde voy
Quiero cenar cada noche contigo mirando la luna brillar
Why quiero cantar why al ritmo de las olas bailar.

Junto a ti yo soy
Lo mejor que uno puede ser.
Junto a ti yo estoy
No me puedo perder.
Escuché tu voz 
Ahora sé donde quiero estar
Al caer el sol
Volveré a ese lugar.

Eres dulce, mi barca en el océano.
Junto a ti, que bueno es ser humano.
Déjame, vivir en tu cariño 
Para ser, de nuevo como un niño.

Quiero encontrarme contigo el camino que lleva al hotel del amor,
Ya sé lo que soy, ya sé donde voy
Quiero cenar cada noche contigo mirando la luna brillar
Why quiero cantar why al ritmo de las olas bailar.

Junto a ti yo soy,
Lo mejor que uno puede ser.
Junto a ti yo estoy,
No me puedo perder.
Escuché tu voz,
Ahora sé donde quiero estar
Al caer el sol,
Volveré a ese lugar... why es que eres tú...

(Vico C)
En mi caminar no existen barreras,
Desde que tú estas aquí.
Que se lleven hasta el aire why la primavera,
Pero jamás a ti.
Porque me puedo morir,
Lo que me das es mucho más que vivir.
Porque me puedo extinguir,
Eternamente sólo quiero existir... junto a ti.

(Sin Bandera) Junto a ti yo soy...

(Vico C) Ni la bebida ni el deporte ni las cartas
Pueden brindarme toda esa cosa que me da tu amor.
Ya ni el oxígeno a mi vida le hare falta,
Why con tu fuego mucho menos me hare falta el sol.
Si la belleza se encontrara en tu camino,
Se marcharía avergonzada por tu resplandor.
Ya tú eres parte de mi ser why mi destino,
Ya tú eres agua why el sustento de mi corazón.

(Sin Bandera) Junto a ti yo estoy
Volveré a ese lugar.........

(Vico C) Junto a ti la maldad es inofensiva
Me conviertes en un niño con el alma viva.
Junto a ti puedo hacerlo todo en esta vida
Eres consuelo, eres placer, eres más que amiga.......

(Sin Bandera) A ese lugar... volveré a ese lugar.....
A ese lugar.....
Junto a ti, soñar soñar,volvere a ese lugar
",Junto a Tí
Sin Bandera,"Yo soñé que te olvide, porque al fin no te lloraba
Yo crei que escaparia de tu piel
Yo logré mas de una vez olvidarte por un tiempo

why sentí que poco a poco me cure
Luché con el alma why con el corazón
Di mi sentimiento why mi emoción todo lo que soy para olvidarte

Pero no, sigo pensando en ti
Por mas que intento no consigo domir de noche sin tu abrigo
Pero no, sigues estando aqui
En los mas ondo de mi vida sin allar una salida, sigo aqui sin ti

Yo sentí que naufragué cuando me dejaste solo
Pero pude manter viva mi fe
Why aun sin ti yo imagine que algo bueno me esperaba

why busque la forma de ir dejandote
Luche con el alma why con el corazón
Di mi sentimiento why mi emocion
Todo lo que soy para olvidarte

Pero no, sigo pensando en ti
Por mas que intento no consigo dormir de noche sin tu abrigo
Pero no, sigues estando aqui
En lo mas hondo de mi vida sin allar una salida, sigo aqui sin ti

Pero no, sigo pensando en ti
Por mas que intente no consigo dormir de noche sin tu abrigo
Pero no, sigues estando aqui
En lo mas hondo de mi vida sin allar una salida, sigo aqui sin ti

Y ahora tu regresas y borras de un beso toda tranquilidad
Y ahora tu me besas y aunque lo intento ya no puedo parar

Tienes poder sobre mi 
Si me miras ya no sé como salir
Si suspiras no me puedo resistir 
Y decirte no
Tienes poder sobre mi 
Si me miras y me puedes controlar

Y decir que no

Si hubiera sabido que eras un caso perdido, sin dudarlo hubiera huido de ti
Nunca fui cobarde pero es demasiado tarde, tu cadera se apodera de mi

Y ahora tu regresas y borras de un beso toda tranquilidad
Y ahora tu me besas y aunque lo intento ya no puedo parar

Cuando regresas ya yo estoy bien preparado 
Aquí sentado siempre arreglado y perfumado 
Y aunque se que harás pedazos de mi vida 
Con esa locomotora no me quito de la vida 
Se que esta mal y no me subo a la banqueta 
Aunque me arrolles con tu linda camioneta 
Te ves buena, mira mi amor que valió la pena 
Por donde con besitos tu serás la cena
