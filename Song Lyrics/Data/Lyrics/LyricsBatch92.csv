Elvis Presley,"Softly I will leave you softly 
For my heart would break if you should wake and see me go
So I leave you softly long before you miss me
Long before your arms can beg me to stay
For one more hour or one more day
After all the years I can't bear the tears to fall so 
Softly, as I leave you there
 
Softly I will leave you softly 
For my heart would break if you should wake and see me go
So I leave you softly long before you miss me
Long before your arms can beg me to stay
For one more hour or one more day
After all the years I can't bear the tears to fall so 
Softly, as I leave you there

Elvis Presley,"We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

So, if an old friend I know
Drops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?

Here we go again
Asking where I've been
You can't see these tears are real
I'm crying

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

Oh, let our love survive
Or dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die

When, honey, you know
I've never lied to you
Mmm, yeah, yeah

For just one hour
If we could find a way to get inside
Each other's mind

Instead of your ego
I believe you'd be, I believe you'd be surprised to see
That you've been blind

Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Yeah, before you abuse, criticize, and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes

Now there are people on reservations
And out in the ghetto
And, brother, there, but for the grace of God
Go you and I

If I only had the wings
Of a little angel
Don't you know I'd fly to the top of a mountain
And then I'd cry, cry, cry?

Elvis Presley,"Born in the heat of the desert
My mother died givin' me life
Deprived of the love of a father
Blamed for the loss of his wife
You know Lord I've been in a prison
For something that I've never done
It's been one hill after another
And I've climbed them all one by one

Oh but this time Lord you gave me a mountain,
A mountain you know I may never climb
It isn't just a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time

My woman got tired of the heartaches
Tired of the grief and the strife,
So tired of working for nothing
Just tired of being my wife
She took my one ray of sunshine
She took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for living
She took my small baby boy

Yeah but this time Lord you gave me a mountain, 
A mountain I may never climb
It isn't a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time
Yeah Lord, You gave me a mountain
Don't you know 
You gave me a mountain this time",You Gave Me a Mountain [Master][Live][#]
Elvis Presley,"My baby's long and tall,
She's like a cannonball
Say, everytime she loves me,
Lordly, you can hear me squall
She cried, Ooo-wee
I believe I'll change my mind
She said, ""I'm so glad I'm living""
I cried, ""I'm so glad you're mine""

My baby knows just how
To treat me right
Gives me plenty loving
Morning, noon, and night
She cried, Ooo-wee
I believe I'll change my mind
She said, ""I'm so glad I'm living""
I cried, ""I'm so glad you're mine""

I climb the highest mountain,
Dive in the deepest sea

I believe I'll change my mind
She said, ""I'm so glad I'm living""
I cried, ""I'm so glad you're mine""

And sweet like wine,
And when she kisses me,
I get high every time

I believe I'll change my mind.
She said, ""I'm so glad I'm living""
I cried, ""I'm so glad you're mine""",So Glad You're Mine

I don't want to hear another word you have to say
I've been waiting for so long
I just found out there's something wrong
And there's nothing what get better if I stay

There's no need to explain anymore
I tried my best to love you, now I'm walking out the door
You used me, you deceived me,
And you never seemed to need me
But I'll bet you won't forget me when I go

Seems I've been lost in a dream
Pretending that you care
But now I've opened up my eyes
And found it's all been just a great big fairytale

I've been lovin' you so long

But now the way that things have been
I think I'm better off alone

My, it's been a long, long time
How am I doin'?
Oh, well, I guess I'm doin' fine
It's been so long now and it seems that
It was only yesterday
Mmm, ain't it funny how time slips away?

How's your new love?
I hope that he's doin' fine
Heard you told him, yes, baby
That you'd love him till the end of time
Well, you know, that's the same thing
That you told me
Well, it seems like just the other day
Mmm, ain't it funny how time slips away

Yeah, baby
Yeah

I gotta go now
Guess I'll see you hanging round
Don't know when though, oh, no
Never know when I'll be back in town

Elvis Presley,"Well, I quit my job down at the car wash,
Left my mama a goodbye note,
By sundown I'd left Kingston,
With my guitar under my coat,
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis,
Got a room at the YMCA,
For the next three weeks I went huntin' them nights,
Just lookin' for a place to play,
Well, I thought my pickin' would set 'em on fire,
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man.
Well, I nearly 'bout starved to death down in Memphis,
I run outta money and luck,
So I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia,
On a overloaded poultry truck,
I thumbed on down to Panama City,
Started pickin' out some o' them all night bars,
Hopin' I could make myself a dollar,
Makin' music on my guitar,
I got the same old story at them all night piers,
There ain't no room around here for a guitar man
We don't need a guitar man, son
So I slept in the hobo jungles,
Roamed a thousand miles of track,
Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama,
At a club they call Big Jack's,
A little four-piece band was jammin',
So I took my guitar and I sat in,
I showed 'em what a band would sound like,
With a swingin' little guitar man.
Show 'em, son
If you ever take a trip down to the ocean,
Find yourself down around Mobile,
Make it on out to a club called Jack's,
If you got a little time to kill,
Just follow that crowd of people,
You'll wind up out on his dance floor,
Diggin' the finest little five-piece group,
Up and down the Gulf of Mexico,
Guess who's leadin' that five-piece band,
Well, wouldn't ya know, it's that swingin' little guitar man.",Guitar Man [Remake][#]
Elvis Presley,"Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone.
Let's pretend that we're together, all alone.
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low,
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go.

Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true,
Or is he holding you the way I do?
Tho' love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know,
Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go?

You can't say the words I want to hear
While you're with another man,
If you want me, answer ""yes"" or ""no,""
Darling, I will understand.

Elvis Presley,"I got over Charlotte Thompson, Goldie Johnson,
Lord they done me wrong
I took it hard with Peggy Harper
She hurt me bad, but not for long
There's just one I remember
Makes me feel funny down inside
I'd trade 'em all for just one hour
Of Susan when she tried

No there's never been a woman
Who could make me weak inside
And give me what I needed
Like Susan when she tried

It gets worse in the summer
When the nights are hot and long
And it's bad in December
When they play those Christmas songs

Left my mama a goodbye note
By sundown I'd left Kingston
With my guitar under my coat
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis
Got a room at the YMCA
For the next three weeks I went huntin' them nights
Just lookin' for a place to play
Well, I thought my pickin' would set 'em on fire
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man

Well, I nearly 'bout starved to death down in Memphis
I run outta money and luck
So I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia
On a overloaded poultry truck
I thumbed on down to Panama City
Started pickin' out some o' them all night bars
Hopin' I could make myself a dollar
Makin' music on my guitar
I got the same old story at them all night piers
There ain't no room around here for a guitar man
We don't need a guitar man, son

So I slept in the hobo jungles
Roamed a thousand miles of track
Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama
At a club they call Big Jack's
A little four-piece band was jammin'
So I took my guitar and I sat in
I showed 'em what a band would sound like
With a swingin' little guitar man
Show 'em, son

If you ever take a trip down to the ocean
Find yourself down around Mobile
Make it on out to a club called Jack's
If you got a little time to kill
Just follow that crowd of people
You'll wind up out on his dance floor

For something that I've never done
It's been one hill after another
And I've climbed them all one by one

Oh but this time Lord you gave me a mountain,
A mountain you know I may never climb
It isn't just a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time

Tired of the grief and the strife,
So tired of working for nothing
Just tired of being my wife

She took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for living
She took my small baby boy

And a dozen towns ago
I reached out one night 
And you were gone
Don't know why you'd run, 
What you're running to or from
All I know is I want to bring you home

So I'm walking in the rain, 
Thumbing for a ride
On this lonely Kentucky back road
I've loved you much too long
And my love's too strong
To let you go, never knowing
What went wrong
Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town
That I'll go walking through

With the rain in my shoes,
Searchin' for you
In the cold Kentucky rain,
In the cold Kentucky rain
Showed your photograph
To some old gray bearded man

Sitting on a bench
Outside a gen'ral store
They said ""Yes, she's been here""
But their memory wasn't clear

Was it yesterday,
No, wait the day before
So I fin'ly got a ride
With a preacher man who asked
""Where you bound on such a cold dark afternoon?""

As he listened I explained
And he left me with a prayer
That I'd find you",Kentucky Rain [Take 9]

Through all the winter rain

Can burn from afar
And nothing can light the dark of the night

Like the stars they fade away
Leaving me to spend my lonely nights
With dreams of yesterday

Laughing at each other in the rain
Made some faces at some people in the park
Didn't bother to explain

Going nowhere special really fast
But we've yet to taste the icing on the cake
That we've been baking with the past

And the next step is love
So what are we waiting for?

Changes are coming, but together
We can make it through somehow

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exception

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed, and cried
I've had my fill; my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And, may I say, not in a shy way
No, oh, no, not me

Elvis Presley,"And now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exception

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed, and cried
I've had my fill; my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And, may I say, not in a shy way
No, oh, no, not me
I did it my way

For what is a man? What has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught

Will belong to the memory of the love that we knew before
Please, come back to my arms--we belong together
Come to me; let's be sweethearts again and then let us part no moree

I walk the night, oh, without a goal
Stripped of my heart, my soul
What now, my love, now that it's over?
I feel the world closing in on me
Here comes the stars tumbling around me
And there's the sky where the sea should be

What now, my love, now that you're gone?

Of the love that he just found
And Marie's the name of his latest flame

He talked and talked and I heard him say
That she had the longest blackest hair
The prettiest green eyes anywhere
And Marie's the name of his latest flame

Though I smiled the tears inside were a-burnin
I wished him luck and then he said goodbye
He was gone but still his words kept returnin
What else was there for me to do but cry

Would you believe that yesterday
This girl was in my arms and swore to me
She'd be mine eternally
And Marie's the name of his latest flame

Though I smiled the tears inside were a-burnin

Please ride her on home

Look good going down?

Get along with you

Elvis Presley,"I've been traveling over mountains 
Even through the valleys too 
I've been traveling night and day 
I've been running all the way 
Baby, trying to get to you

Ever since I read your letter 
Where you said you loved me true 
I've been traveling night and day 
I've been running all the way 
Baby, trying to get to you 

When I read your loving letter 
Then my heart began to sing 
There were many miles between us
But they didn't mean a thing

I just had to reach you, baby
In spite of all that I've been through
I kept traveling night and day
I kept running all the way
Baby, trying to get to you

Well, if I had to do it over 
That's exactly what I'd do
I would travel night and day
And I'd still run all the way
Baby, trying to get to you

Well, there's nothing that could hold me 
Or that could keep me away from you 
When your loving letter told me 
That you really loved me true 

Lord above me knows I love you 
It was He who brought me through
When my way was dark as night
He would shine His brightest light
When I was trying to get to you",Trying to Get to You [Black Leather Sit-Down Show #1]

We almost seem like strangers

Of times we thought we cared for each other

And pick up all the pieces left behind us
And maybe someday, somewhere along the way

Why her mom and dad are not together
The tears that she will cry when I have to say goodbye

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Medley: Mystery Train/Tiger Man

For listening to his same old lies

Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here

You can have her
I don't want her
She didn't love me anyway
She only wanted
Someone to play with
All I wanted was love to stay

But confession is
Good for the soul
I'd rather have love
That I can cling to
Than have the world
And all of its gold

If you get the wrong woman
There's only one thing
That you can do
Just dig a hole

Put luggage in my hand
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the golden state
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
He would set us at the terminal gate

Swing low chariot come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone

Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia
Tidewater four ten o nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy is on the line

Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray to a brighter sunny day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage
And each must play a part.
Fate had me playing in love you as my sweet heart.
Act one was when we met, I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two, you seemed to change and you acted strange
And why I'll never know.
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you.
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than go on living without you.
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down.

You give me hope and consolation
You give me strength to carry on

And you're always there
To lend a hand in everything I do
That's the wonder, the wonder of you

It's you that I am thinking of
As I read the lines that to me were so sweet
I remember our faded love
I miss you darling more and more every day
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you
And remember our faded love
As I think of the past and all the pleasures we had
As I watch the mating of the dove
It was in the springtime when you said goodbye

And remember our faded love",Faded Love [Country version] [Version]

You ain't even proud

I threw them all away
And now you tell me, you dare to tell me

My problems haven't started

Tomorrow for old England she sails
Far away from your land of endless sunshine
To my land full of rainy skies and gales
And I shall be aboard that ship tomorrow
Though my heart is full of tears at this farewell

For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

I've heard there's a wicked war a-blazing
And the taste of war I know so very well
Even now I see the foreign flag a-raising
Their guns on fire as we sail into hell
I have no fear of death, it brings no sorrow
But how bitter will be this last farewell

For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

Though death and darkness gather all about me
My ship be torn apart upon the seas
I shall smell again the fragrance of these islands
And the heaving waves that brought me once to thee
And should I return home safe again to England
I shall watch the English mist roll through the dale

For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell",The Last Farewell [Take 2] [Take]
Elvis Presley,"In the twilight glow, I see her
Blue eyes crying in the rain
As we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again

Love is like a dying ember
Only memories remain
Through the ages, I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Now my hair has turned to silver
All my life I've loved in vain
I can see her star in heaven
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Someday when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no parting

I am at the movies, now I'm in a bar

Elymar Santos,"Tudo era apenas uma brincadeira
E foi crescendo, crescendo, me absorvendo
E de repente eu me vi assim completamente seu

Vi a minha força amarrada no seu passo
Vi que sem você não há caminho, eu não me acho
Vi um grande amor gritar dentro de mim
Como eu sonhei um dia

Quando o meu mundo era mais mundo
E todo mundo admitia
Uma mudança muito estranha
Mais pureza, mais carinho mais calma, mais alegria
No meu jeito de me dar

Quando a canção se fez mais clara e mais sentida
Quando a poesia realmente fez folia em minha vida
Você veio me falar dessa paixão inesperada
Por outra pessoa

Mas não tem revolta não
Eu só quero que você se encontre
Saudade até que é bom
É melhor que caminhar vazio
A esperança é um dom
Que eu tenho em mim, eu tenho sim
Não tem desespero não
Você me ensinou milhões de coisas
Tenho um sonho em minhas mãos
Amanhã será um novo dia
Certamente eu vou ser mais feliz",Sonhos
Elyse O'Connor,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon
Elysian Fields,"Round, round, and around
Surrounding my planet
Arousing my planet

Round, round, and around
Surrounding my planet
Arousing my planet

My heart beats madly like a drum
Beaten chamber, almost numb
It's beating faster and faster
Slow down dear, slow down

Round, round, and around
Flying me forward
Thrusting me far
Round, round, and around
You caught me a star

You can make me if you try
Gently like a lullaby
You dig me deeper and deeper
Go down dear, go down

You are the ink, drawing me
You are the mouth, gnawing me
Yours in the voice, calling me
Star, star

You can make me if you try
Gently like a lullaby
Hold me tight inside your arms
Make me feel just like a star
Like a star

You can find me if you try
Slip into the needles eye
Fold me, hold me like a charm
Make me feel just like a star
Like a star, like a star
Like a star, like a star

Elysium,"In the middle of the night I am still alone
In silent journeys to hidden stars
I steal their light
And fly into an open sky
Where I shall find
All that is mine

You take me there
Where pain slowly leaves my body
Caress my hand
The dawn will never come
A lonely wolf I am
With your light I awake
You are my sister moon
Shinning so bright

In the middle of the night
I am still alive
In silent journeys to hidden worlds
I steal your light
And sail across the starlit heavens
Where I shall find
All that is mine

You take me there
Where pain slowly leaves my body
Caress my hand
The dawn will never come
A lonely wolf I am
With your light I awake
You are my sister moon
Shinning on me

You are the sweetest promise
Of an October night
Carrying me to the places
Nobody ever dared to kiss
As I'm falling breathless into your ocean
In velvet rain I touch eternity",Sister Moon

I'm sorry Steven and Andrew

You never been on a plane
Schizophrenia rules the brain
Aliens coming to take you away
You're still my favorite

Gimme the places I'll give you the names
Wasted away alone on the plains
What's it like to be small-town and gay?
Fuck it baby I know you'll never change

So hold me down but I got it
Quick hit to the face
Soft blow to the mouth
On Christmas morning

You're bleeding from the fingertips
You rubbed me raw you rubbed me wrong
And I heave when I think of you

Oh! California

Now you've corrupted us all
With your sexuality
Tried to tell me love was free
Tried to tell me love was free
Us and them baby

Love in the form of tragedy
Love so much so real so fucked it's 5150

What does failure taste like?
To me it tastes like dirt
And I'm beggin you please to look away

Emage,"[Chorus:]
If I go on my way without you
Woooahh where would I go
If I go on my way without you
Woooahh where would I go
A :
I'm having flashbacks
Let me relax my dome
My whole joints blown another soldier won't be coming home
Parkside is gonna miss you black foreva
Ties will never sever
You died tryin to live better
Did what you had to do and now you deceased
I hope you livin in peace don't even stress that beef
Go head and sleep count your blessings return to the essence
Everytime I see your fam word is bon I feel your presence
Its all over bearing witness like jehovah
ain't nothing strange unless you watch your range like a rover
Follow me son, what's done is done, forgot it
God bless his soul while his bodys underground rotting
We won't forget you let a brother try to dis you
I swear to god he better have a blade and plus a pistol
Forever miss you got babies that want to kiss you
Shining like crystal, and at your wake I pass your ma a tissue
[Chorus 2X]
He was only thirteen when he burst his splean
The shot was fatal
He died right there upon the kitchen table BLAOW
It happened all alone in his house
Not a creature was stirrin, not a roach or a mouse
And I was just with him, playin Sega
And buggin on the horn with some honeys like a couple of playas
And now he's gone
I'm speakin on my man K-Shawn
Forever on my mind mentally as I kick my song
 
He used to talk about the box in the closet
Where his pops kept a glock and all the safety deposits
Now he stressed, fiendin just to hold some heat
I guess it came from all the stories that he heard in the street
I can't explain it, its ill how we used to feel
I used to tell him stop playin wit that chrome-piece steel
He never listened, and now my man is missin in action
I blame it on the fools in the street that's always blastin
[Chorus 2X]
Aiyyo my dreams are filled with terror
Shots gettin nearer
Paralyzed and right in front of my eyes its gettin clearer
A tragedy resulted from a brothers bad scratch
Tried to rob a deli but the gat he had was raggy
Bullets sprayed, ricocheted and automatically
Hit a bystander, young girl named Amanda
The slugs in her back by this cat buggin no crap
Another rugrat, somebody tell me where the loves at
Was only seven already on her way to heaven
She reached her day and now she won't see her wedding
Some might say that this was destined or something
But her parents only had one child and now they left with nothing
Book all that flix and when they daughter was six
Before they moved from the bricks and got caught up in the mix
They thought things would get better now they stressed forever
They last vision was image of a blood-soaked sweater

Emanuel,"I watched the cars collide. 
It shattered glass and stopped time.
Stealing my sight. Blinding my eyes.
Our bodies disconnect. 
Struggle you are trapped there.
Gasping for air. 
Abused.
These hearts are lead and sinking down.
Under the ground.
Tonight, we are all in.
Let go. This is the end.
Tonight we are all in. 
Tell me you're there.
Brighter than aircraft lights cutting into the night.
Climbing so high. In the blank sky.

Consumed.

Had a tattoo on her neck and a ring in her tongue and some tight leather pants.
After the song she pulled me in the bathroom and locked it and turned off the lights,
Then when I turned them back on she was gone, but it wasn't the end of the night.

And at twelve forty five, that's when my homies arrived,
At a quarter to two everyone jumped in the pool,

Said that'd I'd go back to sleep but then I got a text from a girl that I like,
She told me to go get a couple of friends and that she had a couple of friends,
And we in the car on the way to the party about to go do it again

Lay under the palm trees to get shade
Damn, you got a perfect tan
People on the mainland wouldn't understand

You aren't the first to hit and run away from me

And everything will work out in the end
You realise the world is not your friend
There's nothing that you've broken you cant mend

On this new Day
I found my feet
You know you better look before you leap again
On this new day
I found my place
You know you better look before you leap again

Stop before you rush
Before you try to make that final push
Now your prayers will never be enough
It's nothing you cant change

And I was simply watching as you chased
Knowing that as fools go all away
Saying you should leave it all to fate

It's up to you on this new day
All the seeds youve sewn
You shouldn't throw away
Nothing would grow
You're in the shade
And you will stay there alone

On this new Day
I found my feet
You know you better look before you leap again
On this new day
I found my place
You know you better look before you leap again

You've gotta make them see it
You've gotta make then need it
Youve gotta make them see it
See you mean it
Break these feelings

Just keep on weeping
You gotta break this feeling

Keep on weeping
You gotta fight these feelings
You gotta see a meaning",This New Day

Embrace,"Well sometimes I see an end disguised as a beginning
And sometimes I feel the force of the blow
And every day I take my toe and I dip it in the water
Every day it almost freezes me whole
It looks like I'm off the team, a survivor on the screen
Like I've got nothing left with nothing to show
And there's no reason to pretend your middle name's forgiving
I can see you've got a party to throw

(Oh oh oh) I'm gonna follow you home
(Oh oh oh) I'm gonna follow you home
(Oh oh oh) I'm gonna follow you home (Oh oh oh)

I won't quit while you're ahead, I won't pay for what I said
You're gonna have to take it out of my nose
'Cause every word just makes me choke, makes me sorry that I spoke
That's what I get for talking back I suppose
I've been queueing up for this, now my name's not on the list
And I missed who to call to get to the show
Well I don't mean to rush you on, I was stood here all along
And I've been waiting for a lifetime or so

(Oh oh oh) I'm gonna follow you home
(Oh oh oh) I'm gonna follow you

(Oh oh oh) I'm gonna follow you home
(Oh oh oh) I'm gonna follow you home
(Oh oh oh) I'm gonna follow you home (Oh oh oh)

You smashed the glass and set me free
But you don't want no more from me
Your final kiss jammed in the final piece
So I could see
I wrote you letters, sang you songs
But nothing works on you no more
I know it's much too late but I can't let go
Is there still hope?

(Oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh)

(Oh oh oh) I'm gonna follow you home
(Oh oh oh) I'm gonna follow you home
(Oh oh oh) I'm gonna follow you home
(Oh oh oh) I'm gonna follow you

The words that I wasted were bad adverts
All cut and pasted and nothing works
The songs that I sang you just made it worse
With melodies you don't follow
It said on your wall that you're over me
Your image an outline that burns my screen
But I'm not your stalker it's just my need
I said it to see if you'd follow me",Follow You Home

Regrets painted across star filled skies. Never knowing when our time would end. As the moonlight shines on hollow eyes. A frightful image grows. Life goes on without you.

De algún cómic total
Sin argumento y sin final

Donde a la orilla de la luna
He encontrado mi hogar
Y ya no puedo regresar

A los quince la vida
Es un sueño fugaz
Siempre en una cornisa
Sin poder parar

No soy Alicia y nunca fui Peter Pan
No estoy perdida y no la paso tan mal
Mi corazón no es wonderland
No soy Alicia y nunca fui Peter Pan
Este es mi mundo y no lo quiero cambiar
Mi corazón no es wonderland

En este juego tan intenso
El amor es fugaz
Un beso siempre es opcional

Por eso voy sin equipaje
Hacia el nunca jamás
Sin importarme el que dirán

A los quince la vida
Es un sueño fugaz
Siempre en una cornisa
Sin poder parar

No soy Alicia y nunca fui Peter Pan
No estoy perdida y no la paso tan mal
Mi corazón no es wonderland
No soy Alicia y nunca fui Peter Pan
Este es mi mundo y no lo quiero cambiar

Y aunque de vez en cuando caigo
Siempre me puedo reinventar

Silence only sticks around
'Til someone in the room decides to speak

And luck runs out and hearts go cold
We're only young until we're old
And summer leaves us wondering where it went
The friends you have can disappear
The whole world can change within a year
And money only lasts until it's spent

But you, you, you last a lifetime (you last a lifetime)
You last a lifetime

Truth will change and time will fly
The party lasts until the wine's gone
This time next week the radio
Will change it's mind and play a different song

We stay in touch 'til we forget
And beauty fades, the kiss will end
And fame will love and leave you just as fast
You'll have it all until it's gone
The books gets burnt, the statues fall
Sometimes feels like nothing will ever last

But you, you, you last a lifetime

Hey, love, I feel much better

Couldn't keep hands off each other

And silence in the black

And all the signs seem to say love is lost
But I don't wanna give up what we've got

Maybe you could stay a bit longer
I could try a bit harder
We could make this work
But maybe we should stop pretending
We both know we're hurting
Maybe it's time to go

We broke up last Sunday night
Keep on thinking 'bout the fight
Rest my head against the wall
Your bags are by the door

Then your key turns in the lock
You see me on the stairs and stop
Have you had a change of heart?
Can we go back to the start?
But all the signs seem to say love is lost
But I don't wanna give up yet because

Maybe you could stay a bit longer
I could try a bit harder
We could make this work

We both know we're hurting

High up in the sky the little stars climb

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

He smiled at me and he says, says he: That's the gem of Irelands crown
Young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann, she's the star of the County Down

At the harvest fair she'll be surely there, so I'll dress in my Sunday clothes
With my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked right, for a smile from my nut-brown rose

Till a smiling bride by my own fireside, sits the star of the County Down

Inside this dream come true
I'm so gone so far
Lost in your arms in you
Here we are again
Between the darkness and the light
Hoping this moment
Could be frozen in time

I don't want this night to slip away
I just want to lie in your embrace
Never see the sun come up
Stay lost in your love
I want to feel you brush against my skin
I don't want this feeling to end
want to see the moon dance on your face
I could lie here forever
And never see the light of day

I feel her hair slap in my face
It makes me smile
She slides her arms around my waist
Tighter every mile
Her lips are against my ear
I grab the clutch and find a higher gear

She said, Don't look back
I gotcha covered
Forget the past, we've got each other
And as I left the life before her far behind
She rode a little closer
Looking over my shoulder

I check the mirror and catch her eye
She blows me a kiss
A round photograph reflecting
Just how right this is
I shouted I'm the king of the world
And I'll be yours forever girl

Over and over

If you were my girl
My feet would never touch the ground
If you were my girl
My heart would shout your name out loud
I could conquer the world if you were my girl.

The flame that burns inside me all the time

My feet would never touch the ground
If you were my girl
My heart would shout your name out loud

Said let's go someplace the weather is hot
Buy two plane tickets and call the yellow cab

Wasn't it cool, acting like fools
With nothing in our way
Picture in a frame, deep blue sky

Baby, why'd we have to change?

Did we get older, too grown up
To do anything, just because
Just because we just don't give a damn?
Oh, when did we get so serious
What happened to that part of us
Baby can you help me, I just don't understand

In the heart of Chinatown 
And we'd hang out and stay up all night long

A drowning man in an ocean of pain
When you gave me your heart to hold onto

Then the rain tapped on my window, if reminding me
To make out a list of every single gift
That you give me everyday

It's the wonder in your eyes
It's the magic in your touch
Every star and every wish
I wake each day and live
A life that's filled with simple miracles

Sometimes in the madness, I tend to forget
And I take your love for granted
I should hold you close instead

Emerson Drive,"Kick my countrified soul

Well, I heard it on the radio, they're comin' back to town
Playin' at the Wilson County Fair
Put in my forty and some overtime, I think I'm overdue
You can bet your party boots that I'll be there

For some red-hot, real fast, chicken-pickin' turbo-grass
Aerosmith or Cotton Eyed Joe
A little starlight, moonshine, down home, party time
Turn it loose and let it go and kick my countrified soul

The band is a pumpin', the singer's got the crowd
Crazy and dancin' in the aisles
There ain't nobody sittin' got their hands up in the air
There's a couple shakin' like the girl's gone wild

For some red-hot, real fast, chicken-pickin' turbo-grass
Aerosmith or Cotton Eyed Joe
A little starlight, moonshine, down home, party time
Turn it loose and let it go and kick my countrified

Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough
Mama's tuned in to the radio
Everybody's in the backyard, what do you know
Singin' 'Walk This Way' to the 'Cotton Eyed Joe'

New York City, Cleveland, Boston, Carolina, L.A., Austin
Doesn't matter where you're from, everybody needs
A little starlight, moonshine, down home, party time
Turn it loose and let it go and kick my countrified

Turn it loose and let it go, kick my countrified soul

Kick, kick my countrified soul",Countrified Soul
Emerson Drive,"The Devil went down to Georgia
He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind
And he was willin' to make a deal

When he came across this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the Devil jumped up on a hickory stump
And said, ?Boy, let me tell you what?

?I guess you didn't know it, boy
I'm a fiddle player too
And if you'd care to take a dare
Well, I'll make a bet with you?

?Now you play pretty good fiddle, boy
But give the Devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you?

The boy said, ?My name's Johnny
And it just might be a sin
But I'll take this bet, you're gonna regret
I'm the best that's ever been?

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
Hell broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals his cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
And if you lose, the Devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And he said, ?I'll start this show?
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

When he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded somethin' like this, here we go

When the Devil finished
Johnny said, ?Well, you're pretty good, old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done?

Fire on the mountain, run, boys, run
The devil's in the House of the Rising Sun
Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no

Well, the Devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet

Johnny said, ?Devil, come on back
If you ever want to try again
Well, I told you once, you son of a gun
I'm the best that's ever been?

Fire on the mountain, run, boys, run
The Devil's in the House of the Rising Sun
Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no

But I wouldn't turn a lottery down
I just need a little green in my pocket
So I can buy my buddies a round

All I want is a place to lay my head
With the woman I love lyin' in my bed
Kind of understated
My dreams aren't that complicated

I wanna be the one
When all is said and done
Who lived a good life, loved a good wife
And always helped someone in trouble

On the day they lay me down
I want everyone to gather 'round
And say, 'He was a father, brother, neighbor and a friend
He was a good man'

Used to dream of being a rock star
And seein' the world in style
Used to dream of havin' a fast car
And driving that miracle mile

But I've heard tell those streets aren't paved in gold
They're full of pot holes and empty souls
Who never learn
Love is something you gotta earn

I wanna be the one
When all is said and done
Who lived a good life, loved a good wife
And always helped someone in trouble

On the day they lay me down
Want everyone to gather 'round
And say, 'He was a father, brother, neighbor and a friend

When I'm gone, I wanna leave a legacy
Of love and laughs and honesty behind me, behind me

Want everyone to gather 'round

Emerson Drive,"I was coming to the end of a long, long walk
When a man crawled out of a cardboard box
Under the E. Street Bridge
Followed me on to it
I went out halfway across
With that homeless shadow tagging along
So I dug for some change
Wouldn't need it anyway
He took it lookin' just a bit ashamed
He said, 'you know, I haven't always been this way.'

I've had my moments, days in the sun
Moments I was second to none
Moments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't do
Like that plane ride coming home from the war
That summer my son was born
And memories like a coat so warm
A cold wind can't get through
Lookin' at me now, you might not know it
But I've had my moments

I stood there tryin' to find my nerve
Wondering if a single soul on earth
Would care at all
Miss me when I'm gone
That old man just kept hanging around
Lookin' at me, lookin' down
I think he recognized
That look in my eyes
Standing with him there, I felt ashamed
I said, 'you know, I haven't always been this way.'

I've had my moments, days in the sun
Moments I was second to none
Moments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't do
Like the day I walked away from the wine
For a woman who became my wife
And a love that, when it was right
Could always see me through
Lookin' at me now, you might not know it
But I've had my moments

I know somewhere 'round a trashcan fire tonight
That old man tells his story one more time
He says

I've had my moments, days in the sun
Moments I was second to none
Moments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't do
Like that cool night on the E. Street Bridge
When a young man almost ended it
I was right there, wasn't scared a bit
And I helped to pull him through
Lookin' at me now, you might not know it
Oh, lookin' at me now, you might not know it
But I've had my moments, I've had my moments, I've had my moments, I've had my moments",Moments

Emerson Hart,"Big blue skies and an open field
My right hand on a steering wheel
Two young lovers runnin' wild

We bought string and a brand new kite
We couldn't wait to watch it fly
But it flew too high, it flew too high

But here comes the wind, let your string unwind
Run as fast as you can in your mind
Back to a place that you never forgot
Before everything was lost

I don't remember when we ran out of rope
But when we did we lost all hope
We just stood there cryin'
That’s what we learned about flyin'

So I took your hand and you took mine
And we waltzed together in time
But looking back I guess I didn't know
That I was in love and you were letting go

It's funny how your mind plays tricks on you
Seemed like the higher and higher we flew
You took off and I was made of stone
I was made of stone

But here comes the wind, let your string unwind
Run as fast as you can in your mind
Back to a place that you never forgot
Before everything was lost

I don't remember when we ran out of rope
But when we did we lost all hope
We just stood there cryin'
That’s what we learned about flyin'

But here comes the wind, let your string unwind

Emerson Hart,"You'd never admit you played a part
In rippin' us both in two

That got to you
Was it a waste of time to pull the line again
Now that it's gone

And I know, yes, I know, yes, I know
Yes, I know, yes, I know that you want this
Yes, I know, yes, I know, yes, I know
Yes, I know, yes, I know that you still care

It's never enough, it's never done

It's easy to walk when you run from all the years
They stole from you
Was it a waste of time to pull the line again

And I know, yes, I know, yes, I know
Yes, I know, yes, I know that you want this
Yes, I know, yes, I know, yes, I know
Yes, I know, yes, I know that you still care

But when will you learn to make this over
‘Cause there's no harder life that I could lead
Than when I am with you

So you're looking at your past through a broken glass
Puzzle of mistakes that you made

And I know, yes, I know, yes, I know
Yes, I know, yes, I know that you want this
Yes, I know, yes, I know, yes, I know
Yes, I know, yes, I know that you still care

But when will you learn to make this over
‘Cause there's no harder life that I could lead
Than when I am with you

When will you learn to make this over
‘Cause it's alright, it's okay
Just don't say that you love me

Have you ever prayed the sun wouldn't come up
?Cause you know it would be just another morning

Not one that's spacious and wide.
A house that rings with joy and laughter

And all the streets were dark and bare
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair

And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there,

You're doin' somethin' drastic - chasin' the fantastic... 
To dine with tigers in the sky 
But did you ever stop to wonder why? 
Man - living in a can - skippin' with a suit-case 
Frail - living in a gale - slipping on a blue face 
Claws - are scratching at the doors - Pause: If you don't lose your oars 
You're trippin' on a shoe lace - racin' to each new place... 
To screw your shadow in the sky 
But did you ever stop to wonder why? 
Sun - help me when I run - bleedin' from the moonlight 
Nurse - help me with a verse - I need to sing the tune right 
Days - I wasted in the maze - Raise your eyes above the ways 
To keep a silver spoon bright - fly up to balloon height... 
To ride the spotlight in the sky 
But did you ever stop to wonder why?

A chosen word, but it took too long

Some will think I'm strange

Keep searchin' you can't give in

A truth we cannot comprehend

Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I am not the one to ever disappear, but it's over now (over now)
Say it for the last time, one last time
I want to let go of this world for you

When did you know you’d forget that once you tried to fight
(And you claim that this is not your responsibility)
We grow older in this skin, We grow older in this skin
(For the ones that you placed here)
But the day you say you know your own way

The world through eyes
But they were never meant for me

It was placed just right, to catch the eyes
we waited completely naked
But never underestimate the lie, that kind
that breaks it, the whole life that you tasted

I thought I heard her say
I don't want to go
But the words hurt more than I thought through
And nothing leaves you quite as cold
As my father's back turned on me
When you take someone down the garden path
You take someone for all they have

And death
Was only a word
But to a jealous heart that has made its plans
It was the soil that gave it birth
And the sun it’s light there on me
Shone through the clouds and upon my feet
To the ground that we chose as a door to leave

Die for one man
I was so in love, I was just so young and so in love
How could I say no to the hand that was built for me
I saw it so clear, like the first day you laughed or said my name
I couldn't say no, but we both know, we both know

We would have been changed like the days of our lives
(The illusion was ours, it was joy it was rapture)
Oh this place is a hell with its death and goodbyes

And you can't stop yourself when you’re dreaming of days
But these pieces will fade until there's only this place
.
In this world that’s to come, it's only the fear

Was there ever a moment, just a moment the truth could touch our lips
Would it have mattered, the harvest will come

If I would have chosen another, it would have meant I loved him more than you",The Beginning
Emery,"I thought I was the sun and all its light
Shining in the dark, your vengeance my guide
I wanted to take this world back for you
Tearing skin and voice let the light breakthrough

I can’t see a thing
I want this more than anything

The headlight stopped my feet from moving and 
My eyelids could not close or move away
From the echo of the voice that buckled both 
My knees and flung me to the ground beneath the weight
The earth and road seemed like they were not 
There at all but there it was and everything in place
But I was changed, I was not the same

But now I confess, here in my own flesh is the familiar and the intimate

7 words, 7 words have severed into me
7 words, 7 words have brought me to my knees

Count your blessings that you’ve never seen 
The things the simple things were ours to take
But the questions danced around our innocence 
And now the innocence is nothing more than faith
Gather towards the door your things
Come quickly now, the morning gives the light away
Open your heart, to the very worst parts and let them depart

I cut my teeth on the flesh of the liars
I made my words into stones and then broke all the bones
I never saw the blade that ripped up my rib cage
My eyes glazed over and the world moved on
How dare we speak of future and boast of legacy",Go Wrong Young Man
Emery,"I sat there while you plead your case
for confidence and secrets to be erased
I was riddled by your words
I bet that you could hardly wait to send the cavalry
for me, your subtly replaced

With spoils

Of your work
(Don’t forget who you are, when you’re one step from death 
you’ll still have your north star)
The things I
(My strength deceived me, I thought I’d own the world )
I know my worth isn’t
But this fool I’ve become can’t see straight to forget her)

The loneliness of loving someone can steal your eyes
and spill the hope you had and you’re left to spin the why’s 
by yourself and no one else, no one else
The trust you handed over, the people that you hurt
But you could never stop yourself, an addict for the worst
What you felt, were lies they’d sell and nothing else

So I sit here making my big plans
Like they could rescue me but now I see
The answer through my window
That nothing can replace
Those memories my father gave me
Are all that’s left but I’m ready
To escape this life

The loneliness of loving someone can steal your eyes
and spill the hope you had and you’re left to spin the why’s

What you felt, were lies they’d sell and nothing else

I’m sorry for the words I couldn’t say
I’m sorry that your efforts were in vain
You were promised so much more than I have gave
I’m not a honest man I was born for the grave
This city stole the faith you had in me
This mistress stole the life I hadn’t seen
But this face is the last thing they’ll see
I want to feel the sun and sky on my face as I die!

Emery,"You ever catch yourself just thinking of a way to get out?
It’s like a reflex motion
The words slip in and leave a taste that you 
Let linger for days, inside your heart

We fell asleep, just like before, there under trees
I can’t do this anymore

Make this all something that’s behind us
For me, for you, this is not the end but i’m scared

Color your words in a soft subtle sequence
But you force this on us like we shouldn’t care
The fields that they will find us in are marked and now
The end, the end, the end is here

We fell asleep, just like before
You said I can’t do this anymore

You better run, you best not stay
They catch you here this all goes away
This all goes away

Just give me a chance to change your mind
Speak with the others you will see
The place that you now hope to find
Your peace will cut pieces right out from me

You could make this all go away

Years swept by us like seas
And we slept by ourselves to see
We hid hope in our sleeves
And all the world knew we believed

This life took me by the hand
God knows where you’ll find yourself in the end

You better run, you best not stay
They catch you here this all goes away
This all goes away.

The less you say the more i’m can’t shake
The reason you would leave is the reason you could stay",The Less You Say
Emery,"This town ain’t big enough for both of us
So don’t sleep on the things that my hands have done
The flora and the fire keep lighting up the distance
Careful with your mouth don’t let it run

Out of sight, out of mind
Dug my heels into the earth
It was safe, it was mine, but this is where the way turns

Take it while you get it, toss this and forget it
As you swallow your seat and son
You’re plagued with pride of fathers
Long since dead behind you
Careful with your feet don’t let them run
To question yourself the cursed will stay away

You can camouflage, you can lock up and you can stow away
But it is to question one’s self in a hideout to leave the cover
The cursed will stay away
And in my hard heart I tried to block out
And to blot out, and obstruct the clouds
But the shroud, the bell, the blanket and the envelope will eclipse them now

Forget what you left, this part is never easy

Standing where the water meets the shore you feel the sun
Touch your face and leave its mark with nowhere left to run
To hide your shaking hands and words that swore this was the day
You never feel as weak as when the answers go away

I was caught in the current, it’s a lesson and i’ve learned it
The teacher left scars on our fists
I’m the worst, i’m the worst, just please leave me here
There’s pain we never speak of, second guess the ones that we love
And the last thing you want is for your last words to sound so scared
But you find yourself here, alone and scared
Will they leave you here, will you leave me here

The best part of that
Is I want it back
The best things to say
I want to say
That all this time I was wrong
The water’s deep
As they find their sleep
And I begged for less
But I second guessed
That you would come
After me

(from the hands of my mother to the hands of a girl
From the hands of my mother to the hands of the world
From the hands of my mother to the hands I see before me
Could I part this deep
I never wanted to say but I had to
And i’ll take your blame but it was always you
We left after morning as you called to your name)

The past still waits
It’s the pain we never speak of
To catch my eye
Second guess the ones that we love
And I never stopped
All the words and our confessions
To question
I never thought that I should question
To question why",Pink Slip
Emery,"You pushed my head under the water
I lost my breath, but the skyline called my name

The wilds the wilds the wilds they pull you in
These miles we’ve walked and miles we talked have been
The first time I am not alone in my head
By itself, oneself, can’t find where it began

The dust you’ll find beneath my feet
Reminds me of the simpler things
When it was only you and me
But now I see, now I see

So we all fall asleep
So we laugh and play
So we drink and eat

So we count our time
So we know our keep
But it floats away,
Nothing seems to stay these days
Fragile and weak
It’s been years and now
I get a moment to speak

And all I think about
Is what to say
When you’re face to face with nothing
And nothing will escape your lips

The clouds, the clouds, the clouds
They take their shape
We dream that in their billows
Are answers to this place
You ask me to surrender
You’re sure it’s what I’ll take
We broke our bread together
And cursed it at the gates

I’m a son of a father
My mother’s oldest one
You make your trade with your brothers
Sister you’re not the only one

Head to toe I’m drowning
I told you not to speak
Frail and fragile weak dim
The light down on the street.

But the light still lingers

In my eyes

I’m a son of a father
My mother’s oldest one
You make your trade with your brothers
Sister you’re not the only one","Rock, Pebble, Stone"
Emery,"Take my hands and lead me carry me the distance
Leave me at the place where, the
work is done

I don’t want to sound like a broken record
but please bear with me, this is more than I can take
I’m shaking with sweat and asking for a friend 
but somewhere in the end they’ve left my side

Did pretense make you weak your legs can’t even stand 
the promise of the dead is that they won’t be back again
Darkness Darkness found me, here like a common thief
You guard the exits captain, but choices are never free
Take my hands lead me on
I don’t want to give you answers
That you’d throw right back in to my face
I’m exhausted from being myself
But your voice, is the voice here and always

Inside, inside follow
Control that you swallow
You’ve got the numbers on your side
To bury me

It’s just as you said, in those words, I am identified

Let’s get this started right now
The endless excuses
We’re all to watch me try
Now to die

Did pretense make you weak your legs can’t even stand 
the promise of the dead is that they won’t be back again

This favor cast on me, but in this regard I disagree
The life you take is the only thing I have here to my name
The only thing I have is now taken away

The mystery of iniquity the weight of secrets brought to a rest
Blood and bone have been my home, but in the eyes I see
Why it took me",Salvatore Wryhta
Emery,"And I wanted to see it, the crease and the curve of the skin
Four words got me in again and again again
But my friend, it was the light just behind us, I knew we never could keep up
The beds we make, the steps we take, are graves we fill everyday

Roof top views of city buildings gathered
Where the sun sets on them steals the eye
Touch the streets with feet in hurried measure
Our discretion means we never lie

We never have to lie

You stole my eyes, so you I will take
You are the test of our grace
Threads become lines, we cross till they break
And they break from the seams to the bodies of men

The illusion was ours, it was joy and it was rapture
I would have settled for capture, but a lost life found my bed
And all the wages of another and the secret is no longer mine
Warm the body like so many others
Your discretion means we never lie

We never have to lie

You stole my eyes, so you I will take
You are the test of our grace
Threads become lines, we cross till they break
and They break from the seams to the bodies of men

(We will lie we will take
Withered and Crushed the fire and the fate
You will die for our sake
We will see the world in the blood)

Time says we are meant to suffer slink back to the retch
I called him home
I never wanted them to wither or be crushed by the weight
The choice was all his own
How could I have known
The simple answers that hold people to the fire and their fate

Wait and see for yourself it's in the blood
it’s in the blood, the whole world is in the blood

I'd rather tell you how I ruled the world and never stopped
But this heart mine is shaking like a spinning top
And as it slows all my sins have caught the last of me

That reflection in the water tells a story true
But it's the last thing you want staring back at you
And wrinkled hands weak from plunder barely stir this away

There were years where our faces stayed in front us
There were moments we forgot what this really was
But the death of a memory, is the death we carry

We're desperate and dead set, we carry reasons in our chests
We reset and forget, the songs we sing are for the blessed
Don't take this personally, your quiet exit stole the show
The regrets are all said
Kings and kingdoms come and go",Taken For a Bath
Emery,"Align yourself
With the freed men
How can you deny this ground
You sold your flesh

Tell yourself that you’re a free man
Tear your vestments the slave becomes the crown

The thirst filled us the worst years of
Birth and death were held by threads

The turning set about the pages saw escape
The filth of years beneath our fingers washed away
Then gold within our ears drew figures and erased
The wretched lost their way, they’re standing here today

Resist with wounded eyes, wide awake but dead inside

You’re breaking my heart, You’re breaking my heart
Standing here the audience will tear me all apart
The hardened answers you planned fell apart
So blanket me, so you can see, you’ve broken my heart

So I will tell you one last thing, intertwine us for history
It will seal our fates, but I take my place

Your rigid throats proclaim the righteous written word
But you cut out the veins and now you sleep with her
It’s dripping from your mouths, It’s pouring from your skin
The lust of power takes you and the stench has settled in
You have ground your teeth craving control

I see what’s waiting for me, and it’s beautiful so beautiful
I can’t stop these words they all just rush to me
But I guess I’ve lost my senses there’s just so much to see
Many times in my life I doubted your words
But here I am and everything I’ve heard is true
And it’s you, so beautiful

The sky is falling in stones of water, the river’s now in sight
I have thought this all my life, but wondered if you’d try
I was half asleep when my bride’s words awakened me

We were always sure that the pages would be written
Not from our hands but the words you left inside of us
We were filling pools with ourselves and ambition
And here we are drowning out from our lives

To the deep, to the deep

The square of forty and I sit here listening in my head
The voice of angels or am I crazy, these places that were said
Would build a family but nothing from her could ever grow my name
Oh what lies we will believe but I’ll find my own promises to keep

I set my feet on the ground I put my back to this place
(The death here, I feel all around us)
I used the words in my mouth and felt the sun on my face
(Could we leave and never return)
We will all weigh the cost and the friends that we’ve lost
(It’s safe here but destiny’s unknowable)
But for us I fear, these words I hear

I said I would and I meant I’d try but with a wealth of doubts came a mouth full of lies

I sank my teeth in the kingdom come and spit out my years and held back my tongue
(And all that I heard, from the foot of my bed this was just the beginning)

Make this your business what I am about to say
The last touch between us took this all the way

Don’t believe for once that I could let this go away

That simple men of simple means
Can hold the heavens in their hands

The upper case is yours not mine

From Mexico to San Delight
I saw her on a top floor bar
That glows flourescent from afar

I have a place for my feelings
Beneath purple colored ceilings
And when I wanted to be free
I says to her to leave me be

She left alone
And she think that tomorrow holds
Things she remembered from the past
Everything she wants
She gets everything she needs
She smiles, she sighs, and she bleeds

I saw her on a railway station
As I pass a faded destination
I saw her smiling in a crowd
When we played some far off distant land

I felt so alone
And she thought you were taking risks
The chances you took would never last
Everything she wants
She gets everything she needs
She smiles, she sighs, and she bleeds

She's real to me
I saw her in an alleyway
Streetlights dim with frustration
She comes at night when I pray
And brings a moment of elation

I see her distant coming near
I almost want her to be here
But when she comes she disappears

I'd wait if I was patient
And you don't know what cages are

Don't look down you might fall

And now we just feel like energy
New York city will never sleep
And now we just feel like synergy
New York city it's the place to be

I'm gonna win
I'm gonna lose
I'm gonna chase it till the end
And if you're walking in my shoes
You're gonna make it or pretend

Whatever's clever
Whatever's clever will have to wait

And now we just feel like energy
New York city will never sleep
And now we just feel like synergy

Emile Barnes,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary
Emile Barnes,"I'm confessin' that I love you,
Tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confessin' that I need you,
Honest I do, need you every moment.
In your eyes I read such strange things,
But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,
Saying ""can't we still be friends""
If you go, you know you'll grieve me,
All in life on you depends.
Am I guessin' that you love me,
Dreaming dreams of you in vain,
I'm confessin' that I love you, over again.",I'm Confessin'
Emile Barnes,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side

When you make me tell you I love you

They told me, ""Be sensible with your new love
Don't be fooled thinking this is the last you'll find""
But they never stood in the dark with you, love
When you take me in your arms
and drive me slowly out of my mind

I know that you will miss me, miss me

Give me a kiss before you leave me and my 
Imagination will feed my hungry heart

Emile Ford,"Mona lisa, mona lisa, men have named you
Youre so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause youre lonely they have blamed you? 
For that mona lisa strangeness in your smile? 

Do you smile to tempt a lover, mona lisa? 
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart? 
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there
Are you warm, are you real, mona lisa? 
Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?

Emile Ford,"You know I peeked in to say goodnight,
When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair.

And her lucky 13 on her wrist

Hoping that she drifts my way
All those waves drown her sorrow

But I swear I know, that her heart can grow
Beyond that lonely little life that she fears

For all of your life
Never got it quite right

Or you just lose control

Don't you know you'll forever be too weak (Too weak)
To ever get the chance to run away

Just a sad, sad tale,
Of another man calling, another man calling, another man calling
In a mad, mad world
Of a little girl love, little girl love, little girl love
Open up your eyes and see the truth
Nobody believes you, nobody believes you
Nobody believes you, nobody believes you

So I re-read all your poems
Thank the Lord that I'm alone
Such a low I thought that's in your tone
To wonder that you figured out your phone

Don't you know that I'd never be so numb (So numb)
To ever wanna come back again
Don't you know you'll forever be too dumb (Too dumb)
To start to figure out what's happening

Just a sad, sad tale,
Of another man calling, another man calling, another man calling
In a mad, mad world
Of a little girl love, little girl love, little girl love
Open up your eyes and see the truth
Nobody believes you, nobody believes you
Nobody believes you, nobody believes you

Oh, you're not the only one to blame
It takes two to play the game
Thought I'd play what I was dealt
Just turns out I play it myself
Dumb to down I was a clown
I slept sound and you slept around
Anyone, anyone can see it now!

Just a sad, sad tale,
Of another man calling, another man calling, another man calling
In a mad, mad world
Of a little girl love, little girl love, little girl love
Just a sad, sad tale,
Of another man calling, another man calling, another man calling
In a mad, mad world
Of a little girl love, little girl love, little girl love
Open up your eyes and see the truth
Nobody believes you, nobody believes you
Nobody believes you, nobody believes you
Nobody believes you",Nobody Believes You

When you know that all I want is to make your money grow?

I feel you eyeing me, you keep it on the low (on the low, on the low)
But I can't let you in
And I can't keep you out

But it never comes around

And the twilight sings a sad song
All the day, you're gone
You told me the game
Well baby you should do next
So please don't go round
Acting like you're new to the town
Just when it all falls down
Well that's just a game
And baby you should be next to crazy

Oh, time moves on
You've been cold for far too long
See this little girl chasing fame, chasing fame
Till the old washed up in the morning
Got no one to blame

And now you did stay home
Too much time to think
When you're all alone
Remember how it all went wrong
Driving you crazy, you go out every night
And lately you be smart
You can only see your beauty
When it's in a man's eyes
And here you're at, you're fine
Playing at games, so crazy need to slow down
So baby

Oh, the time moves on
You've been cold for far too long
See this little girl chasing fame, chasing fame

And don't know who to blame (Looking for someone to blame)

It's a dice of little life, I know
Will I find out all your secrets
Your lies and all your weakness
Would be no tomorrow

I'm sorry darling, this can't go on just like that
You're gone
I don't play that game, baby told you don't act so crazy

Oh, time stumbles on

Maybe I'm to blame, blame
I fall down that hole every time

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Of paradise, where roses grew

Emile Pandolfi,"If ever I would leave you, it wouldn't be in summer.
Seeing you in summer I never would go.
Your hair streaked with sun-light, your lips red as flame, your face with a luster.
That puts gold to shame.

But if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn.
How I'd leave in autumn I never will know.
I've seen how you sparkle, when fall nips the air.
I know you in autumn, and I must be there.

And could I leave you running merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow

If ever I would leave you, how could it be in spring-time
Knowing how in spring I'm bewitched by you so
Oh, no! not in spring-time.

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

Emile Pandolfi,"My life has been a tapestry of rich and royal hue,
An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view.
A wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold
A tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold.

Once, amid the soft, silver sadness in the sky,
There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by.
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide,
And a coat of many colors, yellow, green on either side.

He moved with some uncertainty, as if he didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go.
Once he reached for something golden, hanging from a tree,
And his hand came down empty.

Soon within my tapestry, along the rutted road,
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad.
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell,
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well.

As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure, gray and ghostly, beneath a flowing beard.
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black.
Now my tapestry's unraveling; he's come to take me back.
He's come to take me back.

Figures dancing gracefully across my memories

Oh, my baby
Wanna be my baby

Baby, when I think of you
My whole world seems, seems so blue
You make me wanna fly, wanna fly
Like a great, big balloon

But honey, I've got a question for you
Do you know the color of my soul
Please get to know me

And I'm hoping that maybe
Do you wanna be my baby
And if you do want me so much
You gotta have that special touch

And I'm hoping that maybe
You wanna be my baby
And if you do want me so much
You gotta have that special touch
And maybe, maybe, baby

And maybe if we're lucky, we can see
A star fall from above
I know what I want, I think you know what

Oh, baby that it will be you and me
Taking this walk tomorrow
'Cause it's you that I like

And I'm hoping that maybe
Do you wanna be my baby
And if you do want me so much
You gotta have that special touch

Well, if you're a tree, I'm a leaf
And if you're Adam, I am Eve
Like champagne has it's bubbles
That's how you belong to me

Oh, maybe baby
Do you wanna be my baby
And if you do want me so much
You gotta have that special touch

Emilia,"When he touches you
Heaven opens up
It feels like magic
And you don't want it to stop
The need goes on and on forever
Until he is gone

The one that you hold close
You treat with great respect
Give me all your love
And I will give you so much back
But trust can hurt,hurt so bad
If you let me down

[Chorus]
I thought that you and me
That we were Adam and Eve
Together as one, joined for ever
I thought that you and me
That we were Adam & Eve
Felt like you were the one
But I was wrong,I was wrong, so wrong

Like a loving friend
He gave me life and joy
That's why I opened up
In body, mind and soul
But with a lie he ruined all(yes he did)
A lie called love

[Chorus]

Take my hand, take my soul
Take my whole life
Cause I don't want it, no, no
You might as well take it all
Just take it all
Cause I want it, no, no

Emiliana Torrini,"Let's get drunk on Saturday
Walk up Primrose Hill until we lose our way
We'll get sunburned on the grass
Playing silly buggers 'till I make a pass
And you laugh at my face

[Chorus]
Unemployed in summertime
I've only just turned 21, I'll be OK
Unemployed in summertime
Don't need money 'cause we're young
I'll just stay awake till the morning
With make up all over my face

Sorry don't get mad at me
I just did the sex quiz from your magazine
You're my best friend in the world
Just like me you don't do anything you're told

[Chorus]

On a mission for my summer kiss
I close my eyes and wet my lips
But then I miss
And you laugh at my face

Unemployed in summertime
I've only just turned 21, I'll be OK",Unemployed in Summertime

Emiliana Torrini,"I thought I saw you on the train
I hid behind some men
I had never seen you look so good
I'm glad you're doing well

I went out for a walk today
To think of things unsaid
Of course I found I'd said too much
So I laid all that to rest

And when the day falls
I guess it was love
And when the day falls
At least it was

You thought of the name to call me
I guess that's how it goes
I know a few with the same name
Yes, I'm sad I'm one of those

Ungraceful as I am in loving
And leaving I'm the same
It's way too late to say I'm sorry
But I'll say it anyway

And when the day forwards
I guess it was love
And when the day forwards
At least it was

Dumb dumb dumb dumb",At Least It Was
Emiliana Torrini,"I'm pretending to be a good fisherman's woman
Just like Anna Ingunn's mom
The gladiator of all fisherman's wives
Makes it a lot easier thinking of you
On the sea where you have to be a month at a time
Working hard in the day

Your hands cracking from the cold and the salt
In the night when you go to bed
You try to sleep by listening to the boat breathing
The boat breathing
And the only thing 

The only thing you can think of is me
Waiting for you by the window
With the brightest red lipstick on my lips
Just like Anna waits for her man
How will I learn
I'll wait",Fisherman's Woman
Emiliana Torrini,"You said I began 
This messy state of love affair
And I drink too much and smoke too fast
And this city's cleared my innocence

Coffee is pouring out my ears
It's the only thing they have in here
And my heart stops beating 

And when it stops it stops
My heart stopped beating
And when it stops it stops
My heart stopped beating

Number tree still on my plate
I heard the trains are running late
And I laugh out loud
My life is a mess
I have gone too far
In my lifelessness

Another coffee it's on the house
The poor girl look is on the owners spouse
And my heart stopped beating

And when it stops it stops
My heart stopped beating
And when it stops it stops
My heart stopped beating

Outside your house
To make a scene
In my head you grabbed me passionately
But the lights are out 
And in an hour I walked on home
In the pouring shower
Lost my keys in front of me 
My neighbor's smile he's handing me
The blackest coffee you will ever see

And my hearts stopped beating

And when it stops it stops
My heart stopped beating
And when it stops it stops
My heart stopped beating",Heartstopper
Emiliana Torrini,"You are true honeymoon child
Conceived on an island in the sun
Heals dug in the white sand
Loved and adored from day one

Raised in a wild space
Between two hearts
With the vines climb trees towards the light
Running naked, dragging a kite
Or your dress on a string

You bring up the soft side in everyone
We gather like ravens
On a rusty scythe
Just to watch
Such a little dove
Just to watch
Such a little dove
Fly away

He said you changed but he wouldn't say how
Well it can always turn

And it's funny how your cause makes no sense at all

Emiliana Torrini,"Then came question and it was about time
The answer came back and it was long
The house it was built by so men in rhyme
But whatever came of his talented son

Who wrote me a dialogue set a tune
Always you told me of being alone
Except for the stories about God and you
And do you still live there, in Buffalo

They put up the walls, no more to say
Nobody stopped to ask why it was done
The stream was too far and the rains to high
So into the city the river did run
Because of the architect the buildings fell down
Smothered and drowned all the seeds that you sowed
I wish I was somewhere but not in this town
Maybe the ocean next time around

I seem to remember the face and the name
But if it's not you I don't care
I know of changes, but nothing would change you
To Theo the sailor who sings in his lair

Then I'll turn and he won't be there,
Dusty black windows to light the dark stair
Candles will nod in the musty air
Oh, with the flames for as many as the years",Next Time Around

Nothing brings me down
Full of wine, unsteady
Nothing brings me down

Nothing brings me down

Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

The windows are open, the flies are in
Nothing brings me down
The phones are off the music's on

Picturesque in its stance

Moonlight shadows start to dance

Engraved in the light

On the cloud within the sky beneath the dawn

Emiliana Torrini,"You won't believe what I just found out
She's getting married on the fifth time 'round
Leaning on my favorite side
And I wondered where you are and realize
Something is painted in the snow that you'd like

want to tell you something
We last for long
Well we've sometimes gone astray
But I can't care for nothing, no way

Never had those kids
I loved too many

The unbearable color of things

Without you here the seasons pass me by

That loved like me and you
All the same I miss you
Today has been OK

The preacher lost his son
He's known by all in town
He found him with another son of God
Feeding on the prayer
Never mind what God said
But love had lost its cause
And I thought today had been OK

The lovely air so thin
The salty water's underneath your feet

Mama say eventually this hurting will end
But the shock waves on my bones will linger
Like the ghost of you here in my bed

When I was lost you thought me a beautiful find
Sometimes I think of you sleeping, so sleep for a while
I find myself asking who'd do this to love
And the white shouldered mountains they pointed above

Lord you just dropped me here by the side of this road
Out here's too cold and I don't want to walk it alone
I've got a bottle of your blood inside me
And an old beggar's prayer on the tip of my tongue

Mama say eventually this hurting will end",Beggar's Prayer

'Cause the world keeps dancing with the paper man.
I love you never talk in dreams,
But now it's here your happiness is real.

Oh make some big jumps, big jumps,
You're afraid to break some bones.
Come on make some big jumps, big jumps,
Life is yours alone.
You hold your head up, your head up high, like you think I do.

Sometimes I feel so confused,
I'm under the illusion that I have to choose.
I love you always know the way,
The way back home always is the same.

Oh make some big jumps, big jumps,
You're afraid to break some bones.
Come on make some big jumps, big jumps,
Life is yours alone.
You hold your head up, your head up high, like you think I do.

Tick-tock, this clockwork will stop,
You're the key for winding up my heart.
Brick-brack, if you don't wind me up,
The sky will lie upon me like a passed-out drunk.

Without you I would never rise again.
Without you I would never rise.

Hey there sunshine lift my heart,
I know life is long but it goes so fast.
I love you never feeling old,
You never bought the rubbish that they sold.

Oh make some big jumps, big jumps,
You're afraid to break some bones.
Come on make some big jumps, big jumps,
Life is yours alone.
You hold your head up, your head up high, like you think I do.

Emiliana Torrini,"Let's stay awake and listen to the dark.
Before the birds, before they all wake up.
It's the ending of a play and soon begins another.
Hear the leaves applaud the wind.

See the sun come rising and white-wings start to fly.
Like strings of pearls in the firey sky.
I don't want to close my eyes, don't want to leave the stage now,
As the leaves applaud our stay.

Lend me yours wings and teach me how to fly.
Show me when it rains, the place you go to hide.
And the curtains draw again and bow - another day ends.
The leaves applaud the wind.",Birds

Park your head upon my pillow
Naked trees they dress in crows
Greet the horses coming nearer

Lay with me
Closer to my body

When things go wrong
You find you're a bleeder
