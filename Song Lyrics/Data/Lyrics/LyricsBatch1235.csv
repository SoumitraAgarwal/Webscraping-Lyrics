The Pharcyde,"Yeah, bam, bam, bam, hey ya, what's up, yeah
We was like that you know
Yeah, and I bet you got laid back
Yeah, I'mma uh, I'm a just sit in here for a couple of hours
Man, don't sweat it, yo, we gonna catch some stuff, dude
Oh no, I'm kinda tired
Nah, we got a basket, we're gonna fill this basket before we go, yo
Alright, bro
'Cause there are otha fish

It took a second to register up in my branium
My dome, my head, my skull, my cranium
My eyes have had enough, it was time to do some talking
I had to creep through the hound-dogs that were stalking
This slimmy caught me peeping, this means she wasn't sleeping
On who I was, so she crept in like a hawk
In a minute's time, we adjourned to the floor
Ooh! I hit a high note 'cause of the way that she was walking
We got into the groove, I didn't bust no, uh, hip-hop moves
I just kept it nice and smooth
Next thing you know, we got together, word, I thought we'd be forever
Didn't have an um-ber-ella, now I'm soaked in stormy weather
Whether two birds of a feather fly or fall it'll be together
Never symping, and leave your love life limp
There'll be no suicide attempts for this slim-trim kid
'Cause you know there's otha fish in the sea, that is, in the sea
In the sea that is

(In the sea) 
You know there's otha fish in the sea that is 

(In the sea) 
You know there's otha fish in the sea that is 

(In the sea) 
You know there's otha fish in the sea that is 

I reminisce, try to clear up all the myths
For an imaginary kiss with you again
Not even friends, though I wish that I could mend
Like a tailor and be Olive Oyl's number one sailor
I ams what I am, still I falls like an anvil
She's heavy on the mind sometimes it's more than I can handle
But men aren't supposed to tumble into the den be	
Macho, but I hancho like Pancho will give in
Family oriented, but not Oriental
A dame is supposed to claim ya even if you drive a Pinto
A hero is a sandwich, and a Manwich is a meal
A marriage is a paper, are they faking or for real?
What's the deal dabbers?  Will you go tumbling after
Your man and take a stand or will you help him roll faster?
The reason why I ask you is because I'm sick of this
Bitch licking drip drip from a niggas benefits
He doesn't even suit ya and he's surely not ya size
I'm surprised that you slept on a heart that's worldwide
And when ya open up ya eyes, babe, my mate, I really wish
That ya don't bruise a limb, as ya swim with otha fish in the sea
In the sea that is

(In the sea) 
You know there's otha fish in the sea that is 

(In the sea) 
You know there's otha fish in the sea that is 

(In the sea) 
You know there's otha fish in the sea that is 

Now, if there ain't no mountain high enough
Why ain't you climbing up?
My hand has been extended every since the day I lent it to ya
I thought I knew ya, but I didn't even know ya
Bro, you're stupid, 'cause ya thought you'd catch a Cupid
And you found that love ain't two wiffs of shit
So I resign or quit
It ain't even about the hips, or the lips or the tits or
Even the pussy whip, Elizabeth, this is it
Because I slipped and I tripped into a shoe that didn't fit
And now the next man is stealing my heart away
I'd charge him like a bull, but his pull never fades me
The kid is going crazy, they stepping with my lady
They working on a baby, I'm pushing up the daisies, but
Hey diddle diddle, I won't play second fiddle
To no man and stand firm on this
And seal up on the bliss with a big juicy kiss
Just call me Big Gibraltar miss
No, I won't diss, I'm just like on to otha fish in the sea
In the sea that is",Otha Fish
The Pharcyde,"Now in my younger days I used to sport a shag
When I went to school I carried lunch in a bag
With an apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss
Always got mad when the class was dismissed
But when it was in session, I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and
Help me with my problem, it was never much
Just a trick, to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug
His name was Lee, he drove a Z
He'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock
I was on her jock, yes indeedy I wrote graffiti on the bus
First I'd write her name then carve a plus
With my name last, on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass

She keeps on passing me by

When I dream of fairy tales I think of me and Shelly
See shes my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasing and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad, and I could be her
All I can do is stare
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare
Now shes more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated
Not at all over-rated, I think I need a prayer
To get in her boots and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although shes crazy stepping, I'll try to stop her stride
'Cause I won't have no more of this passing me by

Time for me to voice my opinion, can't be pretending she didn't have me
Strung like a chicken, chasin' my tail like a doggie
She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan
Dude, she looked good, down side, she had a man
He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop
She told me soon your little birdies gonna fly the coop
She was a flake like corn, and I was born not to understand
By letting her pass I had proved to be a better man

She keeps on passing me by

Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian
And now the world around me be get's moving in slow motion
Whenever she happens to walk by, why does the apple of my eye
Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?
Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence
And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence
From a distance I desired, secretly admired her
Wired her a letter to get her, and it went
My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I know you very well
Now let me tell you about the feelings I have for you
When I try, or make some sort of attempt, I symp
Damn I wish I wasn't such a wimp
'Cause then I would let you know that I love you so
And if I was your man then I would be true
The only lying I would do is in the bed with you
Then I signed sincerely the one who loves you dearly, PS love me tender
The letter came back three days later, return to sender
Damn

She keeps on passing me by",Passin' Me By

The Pharcyde,"People hint and wonder and they want to know how and why
But let me first introduce myself I'm tagging name Romye
I'm 20 years of age I ran across some bullshit
People promise you bowl of cherries but don't forget there are pits
No hints, it's quicks, it's like the water and grits
They got another boy who can rhyme and do the fly flips
And that’s I, Hi, I better get by because my ally
About to flip that crazy shit while I go look for some Thai

I need some zig-zags, zig-zags 
I need some zig-zags, zig-zags
I need some zig-zags, zig-zags
How I love to get high

Oh what the heck
Niggas just wanna get wrecked to the track
It's brand new and heavy as a Chevy and in fact
The Pharcyde is coming and I hope we're not wack
But at this point there's no turning back
But to be exact, I've got more flavors than a bucket full of fruit
In 92 we take cash 93 we take loot
'Cause the vinyl is delicious
I'm the nigga who's ambitious
Michael Ross is the genie he's giving our wishes
One I wanna just jam with your band (Two two two)
You gotta play it all across the land (Three three three)
The plan is grab the ducats and say fuck it to the critics hey now
I was walkin' down the street, belly to the beat
Phat beats in my head, tennis shoes on my feet
Nigga tried to flex but he had to be smoked
So I shot him in the ass on the downstroke

Shot him in the ass on the downstroke
What?
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke
Yep
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke 
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke

Shot him in the ass on the downstroke
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke 
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke

Souped on the beat like a bowl of chicken noodles
I love Spanish dishes but no I'm not Menudo
I can dig Kung-Fu I flip hoes like Judo
Never date a chick who has a mom named Bruno
A anna bonanna bananafanafuno
Yeah you know Shafino
Met her in a trio
Souped up my glass, jet flew her ass to Rio
I'm somewhat Creole
Don't like the man of steel
I'm not your carbon copy but your first draft jalopy for real
I used to deal but the fuzz popped me
I had the hydros but they repo'd my crops and steel
I chills like scotch on the rocks
'Cause I just gets paid for them hard-core props
You know?

How long can you freak the funk? 
How long can you freak the funk? 
I separate the good stuff from the junk
How long can you freak the funk
Yeah, freak the funk
All right, freak the funk
Freak the funk
Freak the funk
Freak the funk
Freak the funk

I want the farmer man. Farmer man
I want the farmer man. You want the farmer man?
Yeah, I want the farmer man. You don't want no farmer man
Give me the farmer man. Once again it's the farmer man

I go from skip-skop to hip-hop to be-bop to P-funk
Cutting enough bullshit to turn a tree into a tree trunk
'Cause we've sunk ships from the Pacific to the Atlantic
I dig dips who've got the hips that are gigantic 'cause I'm frantic
Take you in a frenzy
Takin' you out is easier than pullin' a pull-out out of a Benzie
Box well I rocks the orthodox styles to make you squirm
Yes I come from Cali no I do not have a perm
I stand firm on the mic device when I gets nice
Don't roll the dice if you can't pay the price
I got more flavor than 7-11 Slurpees

The Pharcyde,"Yo man, you gotta be, you know
You gotta be on to die, man, what's up with that?
Yo bro-shot
Yeah, word up bro-shot
Uh, we need some brothers to be, uh, like dropping knowledge and writin' good stuff
Ay man, why don't you quit talkin' all the stuff and do something about it?
You know what I'm sayin?
Oh, you talking about, kick some, uh, knowledge
Yeah, well you do that like right now
And some wisdom for the people
What's up with that?
Okay, I got it

Your mom is so fat (How fat is she?)
Your mama is so big and fat that she can get busy
With twenty-two burritos, but times are rough
I seen her in the back of Taco Bell with handcuffs
The sad fact (what?) ya mama smokes crack (What?)
She got a burning yearning and there's no turning back
Her knuckles drag down to the ground when she walk
Spit comes out that bitch mouth when she talk

Naked on a mountain top, tootin' on a flizoot
Ridin' on a horse drinking whisky out a bizoot
She's got the wings and teeth of a African bat
Her middle name is Mudbone and on top of all that
Your mama got a glass eye with the fish in it
(Your mama got a glass eye with the fish in it)
Your mama got a glass eye with the fish in it
Ya mama, ya mama, ya mama

Your mama look like she's been in the dryer with some rocks
With the big bust nose sucking dirt out of socks
Held up the ice cream truck with a slingshot
She grabbed a bag of Cheese Corn and a soda pop
Your mama root'n'toot and stole my loot and my suit
She may have the muscles, but no, she's not cute
She's not pretty, oh what a pity, got the glass titty
Filled up with Kool-aid, just for the kiddies

On a cliff butt naked, tootin' on a flute
Ridin' on a horse drinkin' whisky out a boot
She's got the teeth and the wings of a African bat
Her middle name is Mudbone and on top of all that
Your mama got the wooden legs with real feet
(Your mama got the wooden legs with real feet) 
 I said your mama got the wooden legs with real feet 
Ya mama, ya mama, ya mama

Watch out, I'm thinkin' about your mother to a funky beat
I went to your house, and she licked me on the cheek
I said excuse me lady, but I remember seeing you at the Palladium
Way back in September
'Cause you was beatboxin' for Lou Rawls
In some bright red boxer drawers
You said ya moms was pretty and young
But she's old as dirt and got hair on her tongue

Ya moms, ya moms, she uses Brut
And I saw her ridin' a horse drinkin' whisky out a boot
She's got the wings and teeth of an African bat
Her middle name is Mudbone, and on top of all that
Your mama's got a peg leg with a kickstand
(Your mama's got a peg leg with a kickstand)
I said your mama's got a peg leg with a kickstand
Ya mama, ya mama, ya mama

Aww, ya mom is so fat (How fat is she?)
We rode up on her back to get some burgers from Wendy's
And her skates went flat, I got stuck in her butt crack
They thought I was lost but I was caught by the G-strap
Heaven forbid a giant fart would give way
'Cause that would blow me 'round the world in a day
We drove to the drive-in and she didn't have to pay
Because we dressed her up to look just like a Chevrolet

Naked on a mountain top tootin' on a flizoot
Ridin' on a horse drinkin' whisky out a bizoot
With the wings and the teeth of an African bat, ba-aa-aa-at
Her middle name is Mudbone and on top of all that
Your mama's got an Afro, with a chin strap
(Your mama's got an Afro, with a chin strap)
I said your mama's got an Afro, with a chin strap
Ya mama, ya mama, ya mama

Your mama got snake skin teeth
Your mama wears coat hangers for earrings, dude she looks like
Your mama was making sex threats to Ricky Bell and shit
Your mama jacked the Kool-aid man for a sip, nigga
Your mama was walking down on Sunset with a 99 cent sign on her back
(You're a sellout) Your mama's a sellout nigga your mama
Nigga your mama did a pop tune nigga
Your mama's glasses are so thick she look into a map
And see people wavin' at her
Your mother got an Ouija board on her back
Sidney with EQ and everything what he be sayin'
His mother be hooked, fishin' with a hook and reel at the frozen food section
Tre's mama got Playdough teeth
Your mother be eatin' Daytons like Now and Laters and shit
Your mama's an extra on the Simpsons and shit
Your mama's so fat you can't even see her legs
It just looks like she's just gliding across the floor",Ya Mama

Over such and such ends that such and such owes

The Pharcyde,"[Chorus]
This ain't nothin' but the end 
So follow me into the sun and let your soul be free 
The E N D The E N D The E N The E N The E N D 

Now everyday I wake up I take out time 
To give thanks that I'm still existing 
Still insisting 
That my people open up their eyes up 

And wise up so we all can rise up 
WAY ABOVE the rim of the muck 
But we can't if we're stuck 
And I don't give a fuck 

And lost in a daze Lost in a maze 
Trapped in amazement 
And hard as cement is the head 
And that why soon everything'll be dead 

And red is the color of the blood that's spilling 
And hell of amounts is the totals of the killing 
I'm tellin' ya is the sky is falling 
But all you're worried about is sky bailing 

You're failing way outta control 
And you ain't doing nothing but losing ya soul 

[Chorus]
Well I suppose that time is coming to a close 
I got no need for jewels cars and clothes 
Need to slow my roll but can't grab control 
It's unpredictable when we will go 

I don't really know but it seems it's coming soon 
The way that niggaz actin we headed 
For our doom but we assume that we immune 
To death while niggaz 

Drippin sweat tryin to hold their breath 
But aah! they slept while the time just crept 
Now they tryin to awake but it ain't much left 
Sometimes I think we blind either 

No hope or faith my people can't wake up 
We sleepin through the day 
Think it's all great but to me it really ain't 
When its time to face reality we turn to a drank 

Or some dank then we can't think straight lets 
Try to make a change for its gets too late 'cause 

[Chorus]

Now everyday I wake up, I be rolling down the street 
Bumping my beat but they try to defeat, My cause, but I'm a rebel 
So I can't pause, But all these laws (All these laws) 
Why, up is where I try to keep, But shit still gets deep (deep) 

How deep?, Deeper than a 6ft grave 
And it's about that time I be more than a slave

I was standing one of the cast of many 
I would give anything to swing hand in hand 
With her but it was just a blur 
I couldn't blame her  why give up fortune and the fame 
For a nigga who can barely afford his name 
So the dame kept aim at the stars 
I'm often thinking about her 
When I'm waiting on calls across the border 
Made sure my rhymes in order cause 
That moment could be near and it was 
Now my attorney is tellin' me to sign here 
So I appear and perform international 
The time came she stepped to me I thought rational 
But she knew I wanted it 
She walked around and flaunted it like a peacock 
I knocked the Reebok Now she jock 
Blowin up the Pactel and the doorbell 
Had to check myself as well love boat won't sail 
Cause I'm not captain let them know from the start 
I let you break me off but I won't let you 
Break my heart

So I'm surrounded by bitchery now this is 
The most incredible shit in Slim Kid history 
So watch if you will the moment some good 
Shit pops and they be fogging up ya grill 
Overly thrilled to get you in ya ass like Massin Gil 
Still burning shit now and I'm still learning how not to fuck 
With ya baby or make ya my old lady 
You just overcasting ya ass is shady trying to block 
The sunlight with all of that hype and now I'm discontinue 'nd 
All of this pipe that I've been laying as long as you keep 
Swaying to another crew's tempo I gotta let you go and that's 
Simple so get it through ya two temples because I'm

[Fat Lip]
She was my high school sweetheart down from start 
When all I had was high hopes my health and my art 
But when I got fame she became unsure 
If I could still feel the same when I came off tour 
I said ""for sure"" 'cause what God gave us, girl, I'm grateful 
No need to be insecure baby your nigga's faithful 
So now I'm off doin' dates in a gang of states 
And as my status elevates I see the baddest eights 
At the backstage gate lookin' great straight 
Waiting for a nigga so now I figure 
""Hey I only live once I'm goin' all out today"" 
Made a call out to L.A. to say what had to say,
Now I get back the very next week only to learn 
The tables turned like a technique twelve hundred 
Last thing in the world that I wanted was my girl goin' out every 
Night getting blunted 
And zooted with a clique of well known 
Reputed groupie hos from all the hip hop shows 
Backstage with her little backpack trying to get chose 
By another nigga with talent wealth and fame 
Oh I suppose I guess I got myself to blame for turning 
Her out into a hip hop freak Now I seek counseling 
From a therapist twice a week

So let me speak about the freak So let me speak about the freak 
Instantly she made another selection 
Because he was in the lime plus had 
The money connection ""correction"" 
""way more paid"" is why she laid and played 
A charade in the game of deception 
This Miss-mysterious mistress is just an actress 
Of the mattress 'cause she's a want to be mack-tress

Offsets them mentally so they're trapped in behind

We was chilling on the bed bumping some Isley thought I was
About to spread the thighs but she surprised me when she
Said ""oh like that? You know I don't get down"" I know my

This is how I put it down, this is my earth, my turf
The worth of my birth is a billion, and you know what time it is
I'm going to make a million",Drop [Extended Vocal]
The Pharcyde,"I guess everybody needs somebody to love you can't
Leave love lonely cause being naive to it you can just
Lose it like that See kisses for bruises don't make it
Heal back it be'z the sex appeal that's from the next
And not necessarily the sex and one might appeal to
The intellect having a greater affect on how they feelin'
Stimulation breakin' down their shields for the real and
As it stands mysteriously curiosity it kills the cat and
Offsets them mentally so they're trapped in behind
These fantasies with no action searchin' for a remedy
Now she loves her man but there is just a different type
Of chemistry that flairs when her desires on fire quick
Is the fuse another loves for hire

[Repeat: x2]
And she said
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish

I was high like the vocal tone of my nigga Bootie Brown
Decided to take a ride to see what's really goin' down up on
The northside of town Of course I bought a quarter pound
Of bomb hemp feelin' aight like Johnny Kemp on a Friday
Night Lookin' right cause' my shit is tight blazin' blunts to city
Lights on Sunset and Crescent Heights Bounce to the House
Of Blues then I slid in free wit tennis shoes, sweatshirt, jeans
And no ID. Soon as I step inside the plizace I recognize the
Fizace of an epp wit an izass more amazin' than grace So
I waste no time to kick my little I say ""How ya doin'"" she say
""I'm doin' fine"" so I commence to mackin' to baby to see
What's crackin' So maybe I get her back at the cabin and
Start attackin' Threw back a shot of yack and started jabber
And jibben fibbin' and adibin' just to get her to my crib then
We was chilling on the bed bumpin' some Isley thought I was
About to spread the thighs but she surprised me when she
Said ""oh like that? You know I don't get down"" I know my
Homies gonna clown cause I let her stick around when

She said,
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish

Now Daddy's home but she's been waitin' all night so we
Could be all alone This is an everyday thing so we hang out
By the phone tryin' to build something real Working tips to
The bone so much loves gone astray that it won't be comin'
Home no time soon So I dance with the silhouette beneath
The moon and she said if satisfactions guaranteed nothin'
Else could come between the flight of a new love babe Yeah
Maybe we could be cool instead of sharin' this here ship
With the fools, you know ? (that) , Right now, right now
Right now, right now, baby, Right now, right now...
Right now, baby, and she said

It I'll give you the world if you need it baby",Runnin' [Jay Dee Remix]

The Pharcyde,"Yo, inhale, exhale
Been a long time coming, still a long way to go
Evolution of manhood
Evolution, revolution

Born with sight but became sightless
Rehabilitated visions from being frightened
In the dark, just bits of light when
Lightning sparks, thunder rumbled 

Chasing courage from the heart
Searching for solitude without a solitary card
Knees bleeding but proceeding to pray to God
Forever humble but before a man boys stumble

Before there was peace vast lands had crumbled
Apart, from the truth a great distance
Met with many guides to provide assistance
To shorten that distance with me and the Maker

The mind was overthrown by the Undertaker
The Devil's a faker, see he lied to me
Singing sweet sad songs to mesmerize
But my eyes have seen four dimensions

Now gather your strength for all these bad intentions

That you seem to get when you get a little older
Days a lot colder, used to cry upon my mama's shoulder
Til pop finalized it, I analyzed it, can fantasize
With your manhood, make your plan good
With the back up, unfortunately niggas act up
Seems to be no solution, too many facing execution
Then I know many ready to leave the revolution
On their evolution to manhood, manhood

When a boy becomes a man
Takes time to understand
The ways of the world today

Step by step, day by day
Don't let the negative vibes lead the 'Cyde astray
We keep the positive vibes till everything is okay
On the evolution to manhood, to manhood

We realized it then re-devised it then exercised it
Got connected and we checked and it's correct
That the soul extends far beyond this fleshy existence
The rest is still trapped in ignorance, giving resistance
From a distance, interference from far away
But neither Tim nor Anfernee had a harder way
On getting here, I'm spitting clear
Connecting with the energies from near and far away
Karma, karma come back like a ricochet
To hit ya so I'm coming with the scripture
For the fixture, get the picture?

No time to relax, nowhere to run
Living on the frontline (x2)

[Slimkid3]
Who could believe in you if what you say isn't true
If he's deceiving me then what's he see for you
When they raise the flag who do I pledge allegiance to
Life in paper bags, sometimes they fall through
Best love I ever had was this world when it was new
Back in nineteen-seventy all the way to eighty-two
Things were heavenly around the town where I grew
Family love was the sound that I knew, or ran home to
Don't it make your brown eyes blue?
When somebody loves you just for you
With no competition testing you
What's the proposition of our disposition unable
You said that I'm a finish, my style won't replenish
You reckon I'll diminish, fuck a demolition
I'm steady on a mission with no intermission
Cramped up in rough conditions like a Cessna in a hurricane
I get my best nuts standing on virgin stages
Feeling timeless and ageless
Seen those like embryos in our invasion
It's universal, God is amazing

[ImaniCitizen Strange]
They mad cause my rhymes even sound fresh a capella
Hella fellas is hella jealous, had me feeling uncomfortable
Cause they're unacceptable while we're the exceptional
Here to let you know they're influenced by the phenomenal
While you're unable cause you're too unstable
All of your progress is minimal and that's the inescapable fact
Verbal rhyme visionaries equipped with stacks of wax
Rhythm that varies and carries like the wind
Travelling and elevating towards unattainable heights
Exercising my rights and just trying to do what I feel is right

[Chorus x2]

You used to ride up high on your green steed 
Usually after they come down,

Well accustomed to being unwelcome.
Exclamation, no comma, 
More drama from your common
Or regrets that keeps coming back like 
Shadows at sunset.
Some sweat while we move,

With weak stories and frail ass tales.

Ruthless, movements won? do it, 
So don? do it, 
Your envy is hungry like the wolf and duran duran 
And your plan is see through like seranne, 
Dried in the Sudan,

Your loneliness was the cause of all of this behold 
It was no real reason for all that to be told
Your brain is twitching, stop bitching, 
Intertwining mine like stitchin
You and your uncontrollable, gullible, emotional conditions. . .

Got you anticipating the arrival of the Cyde

Bring yuh gal to de show mi posse may tek her
Then cake her, how we're flipping thoughts skipping

Take her somewhere remote, got her open like a cargo pod

You and your whole cartoon platoon
Gets eradicated, y'all barely made it
Listen to the words of the man, now I'm hella faded
Now I'm elevated, and now I'm here to state it
Your entire empire is tired, why'all need to retire
Like an old player cause your flavor is now expired!

Resurrect em like they're holy, holding blessed communion
Redesign laws of union in a revolution
Connect the eyes to energize cause evil lurks in lies
Steals your breath and then you die, no one heard you cry
Now he's off to the next man's urging eye
Our excursion eliminates those folks that's purging
Like virgin we be conquering, reconstruct with surgery

Cover your ears, your clothes, your eyes then look alive
The most high, draw swift out the holster
Rude boy ragamuffin, roots and culture
It gets deep, I scuba dive beneath the street
Then rise through concrete with new and improved beats
And kick emcees in they teeth with steel cleats
Extreme like war and peace but none the least

We retract it, then the bullshit got subtracted
Then you got attacked and attracted to this matter it's

Have you screaming yelling, crew bail in

Rub me down like lubriderm, we the cure and you're the germ
Embalm you with the fluid, make you do it like sherm

And acquire that state of being all desires seen

Too long or too fast, gotta spend lots of cash
Break fast, brakes then mash, gotta make it on time

Rush, through my veins I can feel the blood gush
Gushing, adrenaline rushing, increased heart beating
Pulsating, no time for debating, no waiting, rush
Like getting busted, butt-naked fucking
Rushing to have sex, rushing death, that's suicide
Pharcyde give you a rush like holding a gun on nitrous oxide
Or like rolling up on me, man, looking right in my eyes
How women feel when the tongue slides up and down her thigh
Ever tried bungee jumping? I had a real surprise
Try flying high in the skies then jumping out and parachuting
The way a man feels prior to an execution, rush
Eyes bulge, face flushed, scared of heights?
Try being stuck in an elevator falling a thousand flights

Look out for the, rush
Everybody's in a, rush

Under pressure we hold it steady
Nothing will be delivered before it's ready
(Rush) If so? It's okay, later they'll pay
Rushing to do nothing, rushing trapped in traffic
Gridlocked, speeding up corners
Stay stressed but they cannot rush
Rushing to flush the rest of the evidence
A pure rush like turbulence
They want to hurry me, they try to worry me
But they can't hurry me unless it's an emergency
And if it ain't, huh, then please stand by
Imani needs to take time to plan mine
But if I gotta do it on the fly I'll do it on the fly
But why, why? Rush, rush, rush, rush..

Smoking blunts, driving ninety racing on the Pasadena 110
First drop on the colossus, it settles in over shadows
Engraved in the eyes when a real emcee battles
With his opponent, I use it as one component
Linked to the drive when the beat is dropped
I wanted the force to move but rush turns your brain to mush

In grip with my controls to wheel and deal this
Chinks upon my jugular vein
Tryin' to kill this immaculate state of harmony

He gave me the impression that he was making real strides
Thinkin' of real progression
But only spoke on worthless earthly possessions
Brainless, dealing with the strainless
Needin' a correction for this infection
A Brand Nubian direction that left me in true shock
Like when 2Pac got shot

I drop my secrete scripts of the uncanny

See I don't think you value what you got
See look in your hands
I'm just tryin' to be I hate to spoil your plains
We from separate destinies and separate trails in the sand
Even when we walk together side by side, hand in hand
You need a ride? Hey, are (are) you going my way?
Now we can kick it for while don't know how long I'll stay
But the key is to love you for that day
Can't control what we found or what's around the way

Runnin' low on the resources
Heinie missions, future conditions
Don't look bright for the next generation
Temperature's rising
So are the prices
You strung out on the vices
$2 million dollar ad to entice us
We live to want sometimes forgetting what we need
Overwhelmed with greed
The creed is so misleadin'
The plan seems to work and we're right on time
Got us like crabs in a bucket, all tryin' to climb

We lookin' for those critical signs in these pivotal times
Where it is not time for at-ease

On the attack, a contact with the sack to ease the pain
Completely fall victim to a game
In debt to retain
Balance always ricochet to regain

Biting our sound like sandwiches

Freak the peak of this lick, ghetto chic over fresh beats

When you was expectant it the crew and I connected
Keep it collective from first to last
Is it banging is the question that they ask

Impressed with the wrong impression
About this rap shit, it's more than my profession
It's heartfelt, this life dealt a deadly hand
Life's lessons, hard times made a deadly man
Out of the soft, stressing, I fall down to my knees
For my blessings, push my wants aside for a minute
Cause greed had me testing my own fate
My own self-worth and how it goes to waste
All these things that I'm supposed to face
It gets scary on my planet sometimes
My intuition in the back of my mind
Tells me right from wrong
Giving me strength to write this song
I might not be here long
So I take it serious and stop chasing a dream
Cause it made me delirious

I keep my mind a ghost
Follow my heart the most
Don't play fools too close
Sleep with my eyes at post
So Diablo won't be hostin the game of life

And blows death straight through the lungs

But we ain't smart, they got the girls by the hearts

To receive some crumbs from the pie

I was po', black and broke
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
Ass-out, wide open waitin for my shit to come on out
Speakin about the time before I got signed
I was coolin behind Coolio in the County Line
My big brother used to say I was an asshole
Didn't graduate, couldn't handle the hassle
Of high school, why fool
Wit' foolish rules and guidelines
Fuck the cap and tassels
Said forget the trade and tried rhymes
Hooked up with J-Swift, got with 2-4-2
Me and my nigga L.A. Jay back at S.C.U
I grab the MIC one-time
Check it, 1-2, we in
Freakin' major flavors with my fellow Nubians

The Pharcyde,"I guess everybody needs somebody to love
You can't leave love lonely
'Cause being naive to it you can just lose it like that
See kisses for bruises don't make it heal back
It be's the sex appeal that's from the next and not necessarily the sex and
One might appeal to the intellect having a greater affect on how they feelin'
Stimulation breaking down their shields for the real and
As it stands mysteriously curiosity it kills the cat and
Offsets them mentally so they're trapped in behind
These fantasies with no action searching for a remedy
Now she loves her man but there is just a different type of chemistry
That flairs when her desires on fire
Quick is the fuse, another loves for hire

And she said
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish

And she said

So I granted her wish

I was high like the vocal tone of my nigga Bootie Brown
Decided to take a ride to see what's really going down
Up on the North side of town
Of course I brought the quarter pound
Of bomb hemp, feeling alright like Johnny Kemp
On a Friday night
Looking right 'cause my shit is tight
Blazing blunts to city lights on Sunset and Crescent Heights
Bounce to the House of Blues then I slid in free
With tennis shoes, sweatshirt, jeans, and no ID
Soon as I step inside the plizace I recognize the fizace
Of an epp with an iz-ass more amazing than grace
So I waste no time to kick my line
I say, ""How ya doing?"" She say, ""Hey. I'm doin' fine""
So I commence to macking to baby to see what's cracking
So maybe I get her back at the cabin and start attacking
Threw back a shot of yack and started jabbering
Jibbing, fibbin', and ad libbing just to get her to my crib then
We was chilling on the bed, bumping some Isley
Thought I was about to spread the thighs but she surprised me
When she said, ""Oh like that? You know I don't get down.""
I know my homies gonna clown 'cause I let her stick around when

When she said
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish

And she said
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish

Now Daddy's home
But she's been waitin all night so we could be all alone
This is an everyday thing so we hang out by the phone
Trying to build something real, working fingertips to the bone
Too much love's gone astray that it won't be coming home
No time soon
So I dance with the silhouette beneath the moon
And she said, if satisfaction's guaranteed
Nothing else could come between the flight of a new love baby

And she said
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish

And she said
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish

The Pharcyde,"And I still, gotta ask
You could've told me

[Chorus: x3]
And I thought that I knew you
Better than that, better than that
Better than that, better than that

So, so, so
From the beginning it was known
Had a brother here, but now he's gone (real gone)
He's not six deep, find him on 6th Street
His mind now mince meat, sleeping on concrete
Can tell when she went to sleep, she's still weak
About a big bro, overdid it one day
Decide to hit her, no boos, no drugs, no playas
No thugs, no love no hugs
When she caught me, found the stash in the coffee?
Call me from the payphone speaking real softly
That I've broken the seal of trust
On her way to her momma's house
On the bus, it was old for us, don't make a fuss
She said, as the tears shed, explained that she felt
Mislead, she couldn't take the pain if I was jailed
Or found dead, or if I'd went onside her head
I tried to convince her, only happens to a few
How could I question, after all she'd been through
She said she felt bad, but there was nothin' I could do
I thought I knew, I thought I knew

[Chorus: x2]

Yeah, me and my man's go back way before the music
I'd never thought that he would lose it and do that
All year he used to be in my house, but now I can't wait to
Smack the taste out of his mouth
They say that money is the root of all evil, but not having money
Is the root of all evil, chilling, talking, walking with my people
Talking the walk about how shit goin' be, we gonna rock under
Any circumstances, when I'm on the microphone
You know we advancin', with or without you, can't fuck with you
We try to forget you, cause we're trying to get richer

I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and
Help me with my problem, it was never much
Just a trick, to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug
His name was lee, he drove a z
He'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock
I was on her jock, yes indeedy I wrote graffiti on the bus
First Id write her name then carve a plus
With my name last, on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass

She keeps on passing me by

When I dream of fairy tales I think of me and Shelly
See shes my type of hype and I cant stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasing and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad, and I could be her 
But, all I can do is stare
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare
Now shes more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated
Not at all over-rated, I think I need a prayer
To get in her boots and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although shes crazy stepping, Ill try to stop her stride

And I must voice my opinion of not even pretending she didn't have me
Strung like a chicken, chase my tail like a doggie
She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan
Dude, she looked good, down side, she had a man
He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop
She told me soon your little birdies gonna fly the coop
She was a flake like corn, and I was born not to understand
By letting her pass I had proved to be a better man

She keeps on passing me by 

Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian

Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?

Never play

The Philosopher Kings,"I saw a foreign movie
At my girlfriend's place last night
Through smooth pictures in a
Dream of black and white

Saw this girl with the clean soul
Of a maharani queen
She reminded me of someone
I know

The lines she was reading
Seemed to reach just this man
Though her painted lips hung
Words I couldn't understand

And a I turned out the station
Swear she spoke to me alone
She said 'please, ain't it time you
Come home'

For the doorway I started
Light headed and heavyhearted
Can't move on, can't get through
I just can't get my mind around you

I could feel myself falling,
It's my spirit that's been cut
Torn through shattered muscle to
Put the ginger in my blood

Now my baby calls me,
And my name falls down like rain
'Cause I'm back in your soft
Smile again

With your nerve gas and your
Mortar

I'm tangled up inside your net
I can't get out
Coughed up my life
I changed it all by loving you

The Piano Tribute Players,"She couldn't take one more day
Home was more her prison now
Independence called out
She had to get it 

A fight was all she needed 
To give her reason
She slammed the door with no goodbye
And knew that it was time

Now she's driving to fast
She didn't care to glance behind
And through her tears she laughed
It's time to kiss the past goodbye

I'm finally on my own
Don't try to tell me no
There's so much more for me
Just watch what I will be

She walked away
Couldn't say why she was leaving
She walked away
She left all she had believed in

Not a day goes by
For the ones she's left behind
They're always asking ""why?""
And thoughts of her consume her mind

God please let her know
The love we tried to show
We'd promise anything
If you'd just bring her home

Tell her she's wanted

Clutching tightly not one has fallen.
So many years Ive shaped each one 
Reflecting my heart, showing who I am.

Cant open my hand; cant let go
Does it matter?
Should I show you? 
Cant you let me go?

You whisper gently
You say I will be free
I know but cant you see

Say you have a plan for me
And that you want the best for my life.
Told me the world has yet to see
What you can do with one
That's committed to your call.

That I cant hold these dreams forever.
But if I give them now to you
Will you take them
Away forever?
Or can I dream again?",Surrender

From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Out in West Virginia
Is a little college
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

All the student body
Only cared for football
Never mind the knowledge
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

Never mind the sheepskin
They preferred the pigskin
Seemed to have it in their bones
Yeah, they knew all about it

Couldn't do without it
All except a certain Mr. Jamboree Jones
And he played the clarinet with all his might
He studied night and day, he practiced day and night

No runnin' up the field for Mr. Jones
He'd rather run up the scale and down the scale,
What tones.
Even though his buddies

Always cut their studies
To attend the rallies
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
While they all were rootin'

You could hear him tootin'
""What's become of Sally""
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
How they used to hate him

Co-eds wouldn't date him
Thought he was an awful bore
Oh, but he liked his rhythm
More than being with `em

So he'd only turn in
For to practice some more
And meanwhile the team marched on to greater fame
Till they were asked to play that famous Rose Bowl game

And on that day of days the students beamed
What did they do when the team marched on the scene
I want to tell you ladies and you gentlemen, they screamed.
Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah

Biff-boom-bah, bah-bah-dee-addle-oh
Yea-ho, watch `em go
Startin' from the kick-off,
They pulled every trick off

But they couldn't win it
(No, no, no)
Instead of goin' forwards
They were goin' backwards

`Bout a mile a minute
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Seein' their position
They called intermission

And they heard the referee say
Hey, seventeen to nothin'
Ain't exactly nothin'
And you've only got about a minute to play

And then from the stand there came a distant wail
And it was Jamboree a-swingin' ""Hold `em Yale""
(Bula, bula, bula)
And then the students all began to yell

And down the field, pell mell.

Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this

Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town

Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye

I'd love you and end though, for your love

A guy like me, said I just might kill you

Oh lady, I'd fill a mountain, I'm covered in lotion, for your love
I said lady, I'd swim 'cross the ocean,

When you cry it smells like soup,

Stretched out on a long white table so cold so pale so fair

Bermuda, triangle, erupting on Ryzarector tracks

Mines combine the modus click 
Enterprise like German spies, keep my eyes on Soviets 
Stay Russian my direction I'm wettin' like a leaf bone 
Freak poems, seek thrones, to call home where freaks bone 
To each his own, chrome zones, be cloned like chromosomes 
So the chrome, the golden toned champ whip rollin' bones 
Fire's on, blazin' hot trails at night, barren ville

Generate a mil, Killa Bee law, kill or be killed

Go to the dungeon I could lead a hundred men, with a golden pen 
Forced to intercept with the click from Shaolin

She doesn't see, that she is bordering on arrogance
When will she learn, to come back to the middle

He is, a young black man, grew up without his father
And now it falls into his hands, to protect his mother
Cause if he doesn't, well then who will, his older brother lives in fear
Of everything, especially, trying to fill his father's shoes

Respectively, they go to extremes, of masculine and feminine
Chasing dreams, but they keep on falling
Cause they don't know no balance
When will they learn, to come back to the middle

You must take the good with the bad, and you might hit the wall
Sometimes you'll fly and sometimes you'll fall
There isn't any way, to avoid the pain
But it's getting burned, that's how you will learn
To come back to the middle

Needing to protect your self now that is just a part of life
If you let your fears keep you from flying, you will never reach your height
To get to the top you must come back to the middle
When will we learn, to come back to the middle

Come back to the middle, Come back to the middle
Don't make no mind about falling down
Cause it's when you're in that valley
You can see both sides more clearly

Come back to the middle",Back to the Middle

Are you giving back what you take

Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.

You're so good to me
I know but I can't change
Tried to tell you
But you look at me like maybe
I'm an angel underneath
Innocent and sweet
Yesterday I cried
Must have been relieved to see
The softer side
I can understand how you'd be so confused
I don't envy you
I'm a little bit of everything
All rolled into one

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

So take me as I am
This may mean
You'll have to be a stronger man
Rest assured that
When I start to make you nervous
And I'm going to extremes
Tomorrow I will change
And today won't mean a thing

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

Just when you think, you got me figured out
The season's already changing
I think it's cool, you do what you do
And don't try to save me

I'm a child, I'm a mother

I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell, I'm your dream

Uh huh sure you know you look kinda familiar.

Yeah you do to, but I just wanted to know do you know somebody named?
Oh you know his name.

Oh yeah definitely I know his name.

Well i just want to let you that he's mine.

Huh no no he's mine!

You need to give it up

I'm sorry that you
seem to be confused
He belongs to me

Think its time we got this straight
Sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man are you insane

But see I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But your blind if you can't see
That his love is holding me

See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make it
Through the day, Ain't that a shame

But maybe you misunderstood
Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good

You need to know its me not you
And if you didn't know it's cause it's true

I think that you should realize
And try to understand why
He is apart of my life
I know its killing you inside

You can say what you wanna say
What we have you can't take
From the truth you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake

When will you get the picture
Your the past I'm the future
Get away it's my time to shine
If you didn't know the boy is mine

You need to give it up

Your silly games I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel

What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special place that's in my heart
He was my love right from the start

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see

Till everybody knowing
That twelve o'clock the roof will be blowing
Drinks on me, up the cups, and
Midnight coming full thrust, and
Dick Clark holding it down, and
The second hand rolling around (Na, na, na, na)
Hundred thousands deep, world wide press
Hate to be the man that gotta clean this mess
Same resolution, get the money
Ain't where we've been, it's where we gonna be
Get ready to hum Auld Lang Syne
Cause a person that know the words is hard to find
First soul train line of the year

When the clock struck twelve in the year two g
Medianoche finally near
This will be that anthem amongst the cheers
Just the man to usher it in
Big Will bringing the heat
K-Ci bringing the plan
Ringing it in, waiting for the ball to drop
That 2000 vault we breaking the lock
Let hip-hop keep blazing the charts
May the past keep a warm spot in your heart
May the future hold more joy then pain
Hands in the air waiting for confetti to rain

Saw her walking all around the school

Are you still looking for a fight?
You know you're mum is not that mean?

Then you should see what my friends do

We could talk about lies
He said we could talk about rumours
We could do whatever I like

Don't trouble your pretty head, your pretty head

Why not get right to the point, its not that often we are left alone

No-one ever told you then, but conversations in my head helped me to pass the time

To have my fortune read
I didn't what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head

Said she'd take a look at my palm
Said ""Son, do you feel kind of warm?""
And she looked into her crystal ball
Said ""You're in love""

Said it could not be so
Not with all the girls I know
Said when the next one arrives
Looking into her eyes

I left there in a hurry
Much to my big surprise

Nothing ever happened that could bring me down
Thinking that the good times were always gonna stay
But it's been a long time since I've seen a sunny day
Living in the burb's, waiting for the repo man
To take away my car due to insufficiant funds
I got nowhere to go, and my wife just ran away,
With my lawyer and my credit cards, but that's ok,
They never worked anyway
Growing up I listened to my parents as they said:
'Go to school get a job, and then you've got it made'
Maybe that formula worked back in their day,
But I can tell you brother that a lot of things have changed
Looking through the window on to the driveway,
Watching for the repo man 24 hours a day,
Stepping outside, I raise my .45
Giving up the future for today
It never worked anyway, I' m wating for the repo man

The Planet Smashers,"Question marks in the dark
Making hard to start- always never knowing
Suddenly, I can see how the path lies for me,
It's time to get going
I perceive your concern and I try to relate
You say I should be staying
You resist and insist telling me to beware
Like you've already been there
CHORUS:
No matter what you say, I'm on my way
No matter what you say I'll do it anyway
I say to each his own when all's told- it is wrong not to recognize this
I'm aware of your advice I really do understand
I hear what you're saying
*CHORUS* (""I'm on my way"" 3x, ""I'll do it anyway"" once)
No more misunderstanding
I won't be caught demanding
For your reassurance cause it has no consequence
*CHORUS* (""I'm on my way"" 3x, ""I'll do it anyway"" once, ""no matter what you say"" until end)



",No Matter What You Say
The Planet Smashers,"How can I feel the way I do
Each time I get this close to you
The part of me that won't let go
Making me keep my self control
Save it for the right time
When we'll start again
Tomorrow's just around the bend
Softly crawl into my shell and wait it out till everything is well
What makes me act the way I do
The earth the stars the sky the moons,
Life memories silver and goal,
What makes good times so hard to hold
Save it for the right time when we'll start again
There's no reason to pretend wandering around the world
Trying to find myself
You can never walk away from where you are
But right here at home, next to you so all alone,
Is no know one that you've ever known
Silently, sorry
Why save it for the right time
When that's just pretend we can't never have this day again
Love is waiting on the shelf
While I'm too scared to be a friend
Wandering around the world trying to find myself
I turn around one day and there you are...
Don't save it cause the right time is the one we're in
So no more waiting to begin open my heart going to let it sing
Each grain of sand is everything
The truth is never quite
So far we can never walk away from where we are...

The cool video store's too far away
It's raining out so I'll have to put on with Blockbuster one more day
And sit through another plot
Chopped up letterboxed on my twelve inches screen

I wish my life was effort free
Whinning for what I want
Cause trying is just too hard
Trying is just too hard, whinning for what I want...
I can't get the record I want the indie shop's too far away
My brother lives in the city,
He says he's going to tape it for me someday
In the meantime, I'll listen to myself complain,
Tomorrow I'll continue with the same thing again
And what ain't right if you ask me,
The best things in life you should come more easily

A little Nash Rambler was following me, about one-third my size.
The guy must have wanted it to pass me up
As he kept on tooting his horn. Beep! Beep!
I'll show him that a Cadillac is not a car to scorn.

Refrain:
Beep, beep. (Beep, beep.)
Beep, beep. (Beep, beep.)
His horn went, beep, beep, beep. (Beep! Beep!).

I pushed my foot down to the floor to give the guy the shake,
But the little Nash Rambler stayed right behind; he still had on his brake.
He must have thought his car had more guts
As he kept on tooting his horn. Beep! Beep!
I'll show him that a Cadillac is not a car to scorn.

Beep, beep. (Beep, beep.)
Beep, beep. (Beep, beep.)
His horn went, beep, beep, beep. (Beep! Beep!).

My car went into passing gear and we took off with dust.
And soon we were doin' ninety, must have left him in the dust.
When I peeked in the mirror of my car,
I couldn't believe my eyes.
The little Nash Rambler was right behind, you'd think that guy could fly.

Beep, beep. (Beep, beep.)
Beep, beep. (Beep, beep.)
His horn went, beep, beep, beep. (Beep! Beep!).

Now we're doing a hundred and ten, it certainly was a race.
For a Rambler to pass a Caddy would be a big disgrace.

With spyglass in his hand;
There's a whale, there's a whale,
And a whalefish he cried
And she blows at every span, brave boys

The captain stood on the quarter deck,
The ice was in his eye;
Overhaul, overhaul! Let your gibsheets fall,
And you'll put your boats to sea, brave boys
And you'll put your boats to sea.

Our harpoon struck and the line played out,
With a single flourish of his tail,
He capsized the boat and we lost five men,
And we did not catch the whale, brave boys,
And we did not catch the whale.

The losing of those five jolly men,
It grieved the captain sore,
But the losing of that fine whalefish
Now it grieved him ten times more, brave boys

It isn't the wind in the well

Out of that hole in the wall

Out of hell

When you wake up and scream
The cold things that follow you
Down the boreen
They live in the small ring of trees on the hill
Up at the top of the field

And they dance on the rain
And they dance on the wind
They tap on the window
When no-one is in
And if ever you see them

Pretend that you're dead
Or they'll bite off your head
They'll rip out your liver

Then we drank tequila

And the song that he'd sing was of ganders and all

Who came from a time before aeroplanes flew
He'd sit in a corner and mule quite a few

And never was known to put a foot wrong

The furnace blazed, the wheels they rolled

When I was older, I drank in bars
When I was young, well, I chewed the leaves

She left me drunk in New Orleans
So cold and lonely, so all alone
I wished my heart was made of stone

I took the cold bright needle
I used it as a sword
My eyes have seen the glory of
The coming of the Lord

I burned across the Delta
I swam across the Ford
My eyes have seen the glory of
The coming of the Lord

When I was a young man, standing on this road
My empty belly, an aching hole
An old man said to me, ""Kid don't you know?""
That it's the same wherever you go

I gambled in two graveyards
I won against the odds
With the saints and with the saviors
With the maggots and the Gods

I cursed the things they showed me
I could never see again
And the howling of the wind at night
I wrote upon the rain

I found the thing for which I prayed
And came back home to the USA
With a heart of stone, so now I know
That it's the same wherever you go

Wherever you go
Wherever you go

Wherever you go
Wherever you go

Come, come here we come
Come, come here we come

The Pogues,"Alligators snap at your ankles
And branches snap at your brain
If I ever get through this swamp alive
I'll nevermore pray for rain

This must be the place
And still it somehow don't seem right
Something in the moon could change
These endless days to lonely nights

I take a stroll down by the sea
And walk along the pier
Then I slip and hit my head
Now's the time to fear

I see the surface, see the rocks
See my past fly swiftly by
I feel the water in my lungs
And wake up screaming for my life

In my blue heaven
There's a bottle of Pontchartrain
Chalmette by moonlight
To take away the pain

Card sharks and blue harps
And dolphins who leap
In my blue heaven
Where I can laugh and I can weep

Black shapes zip into corners
The big lads start to crawl
To holes of their own making
In the cracks within the wall

Snakes and rats and spiders
I know that they're still there
I pray to God that I may sleep
Without a hope, without a care

In my blue heaven
There's a bottle of Pontchartrain
Chalmette by moonlight
To take away the pain

Felines and sea lions
And rain on the beach
In my blue heaven
With angels who aren't out of reach

In my blue heaven
There's a bottle of Pontchartrain
Chalmette by moonlight
To take away the pain

Nightingales sing
And the bells they will ring
In my blue heaven
The bells of Hell
Go ding a ling a ling

The Pogues,"POGUES - LORELEI 

You told me tales of love and glory
Same old sad songs, same old story
The sirens sing no lullaby
And no-one knows but Lorelei.

By castles out of fairytales
Timbers shivered where once there sailed
The lovesick men who caught her eye
And no-one knew but Lorelei.

River, river have mercy
Take me down to the sea
For if I perish on these rocks
My love no more I'll see...

I've thought of you in far-off places
I've puzzled over lipstick traces
So help me god, I will not cry
And then I think of Lorelei.

I travel far and wander wide
No photograph of you beside me
Ol' man river's not so shy
And he remembers Lorelei.

River, river have mercy
Take me down to the sea
For if I perish on these rocks
My love no more I'll see.

If I should float upon this stream
And see you in my madman's dream
I'd sink into your troubled eyes
And none would know 'cept Lorelei.

River, river have mercy
Take me down to the sea
For if I perish on these rocks
My love no more I'll see.

But if my ship, which sails tomorrow
Should crash against these rocks,
My sorrows I will drown before I die

The Pogues,"I dreamt we were standing
By the banks of the Thames
Where the cold grey waters ripple
In the misty morning light
Held a match to your cigarette
Watched the smoke curl in the mist
Your eyes, blue as the ocean between us
Smiling at me

I awoke so cold and lonely
In a faraway place
The sun fell cold upon my face
The cracks in the ceiling spelt hell
Turned to the wall
Pulled the sheets around my head
Tried to sleep, and dream my way
Back to you again

Slowly passing by
Step on a plane
And fly away
I'll see you then

On a cold and misty morning

And a short for Father Loyola

And God can't help the state I'm in

There's a Tesco on the sacred ground
Where I pulled her knickers down
While Judas took his measly price
As Saint Anthony gazed in awe at Christ

I gave my love a goodnight kiss
I tried to take a late-night piss
But the toiled moved, so again I missed

I sat on the floor and watched TV
Thanking Christ for the BBC

You left me on the deck

And threw his arms around my neck
For all these years I've had him on my back

I dreamt I met with Behan
I shook him by the hand and we passed the time of day
When questioned on his views
On the crux of life's philosophies
He had but these few clear and simple words to say

I am going, I am going
Any which way the wind may be blowing
I am going, I am going
Where streams of whiskey are flowing

I have cursed, bled and sworn
Jumped bail and landed up in jail
Life has often tried to stretch me
But the rope always was slack
And now that I've a pile
I'll go down to the Chelsea
I'll walk in on my feet
But I'll leave there on my back

Because I am going, I am going
Any which way the wind may be blowing
I am going, I am going
Where streams of whiskey are flowing

Oh the words that he spoke
Seemed the wisest of philosophies
There's nothing ever gained
By a wet thing called a tear
When the world is too dark
And I need the light inside of me
I'll walk into a bar
And drink fifteen pints of beer

I am going, I am going
Any which way the wind may be blowing
I am going, I am going

He played it from the night time to the peaceful early morn
He soothed the souls of psychos and the men who had the horn
And they all looked very happy in the morning

But Jimmy didn't like his place in this world of ours
Where the elephant man broke strong men's necks when he'd had too many pours
So sad to see the grieving and the people that I'm leaving
And he took the road for god knows in the morning

We kissed him as we put him on the train
And we sang him a song of times long gone

I learned to love the virtues of sweet Sally Maclennane
I took the jeers and drank the beers and crawled back home at dawn
And ended up a barman in the morning

I played the pump and took the hump and watered whiskey down
I talked of whores and horses to the men who drank the brown
I heard them say that Jimmy's making money far away
And some people left for heaven without warning

The earth moves below me

It's the middle of summer and i'm chilled to the bone
There's holes in my shoes where the rain comes in
I'm sitting on top of the world

Walking in the shadows of empty office blocks
I was talking to a stranger and he's on the rocks
Down on the pavement living in a box

It's been a bad day and i want a little peace

Oh no won't you please help me

There's poison in the air the water and the soil

And dream a world for you and me
Beyond the walls, a city breathes
In this room one heart beats
The stars, they shine for you and me

On the street, ten floors below
The city lights are all aglow
The corner girls, they come and go
Dreaming of a ticket home
The stars, they shine for you and me

I'll have a drink and then we'll see
If the spirit conjures your genie
To lie beside me in my dreams
The wind is blowing a melody

Close the door and turn the key
And now that you're alone with me
We'll sit up late and watch TV

The Pogues,"The shaman came a calling
He was howling at the moon
He offered me a vision
On the end of a silver spoon
He said he'd give me dreams
That all were in his powers
If only i would follow him
The universe was ours

Walked a thin white line to the coffin club
Downstairs from the devils den
Had a large double Jesus
Chased down with a shot of zen

Was lying in the tank
And when i came around again
Everything was blank

Floating high above the world
Out on the astral plane

I met god on primrose hill
That's where he came to me
He stepped out of his saucer
I got down on my knees
From his lips came just one word
He left me all aglow
I sat down and had a smoke
And watched the flowers grow

The bats are in the belfry
And the bubbles in the bong
The secret of the universe
Is hidden in this song

The shaman left a crawling
As the dawn broke the gloom
Talking in some other tongue
And laughing like a loon
The early morning sunlight
Splashed colours on the wall
And i don't know if it ever
Really happened at all

It was raining worse than anything that I have ever seen
I drank ten pints of beer and I cursed all the people there
And I wish that all this raining would stop falling down on me

And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink
And mother, wake me early in the morning

At the time, I was working for a landlord
And he was the meanest bastard that you have ever seen
And to lose a single penny would grieve him awful sore
And he was a miserable bollocks and a bitch's bastard's whore

And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink
And mother, wake me early in the morning

I recall we took care of him one Sunday
We got him out the back and we broke his fucking balls
And maybe that was dreaming and maybe that was real
But all I know is I left that place without a penny or fuck all

And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink
And mother, wake me early in the morning

But now I've the most charming of verandahs
I sit and watch the junkies, the drunks, the pimps, the whores

I wish to Christ, I wish to Christ that I had fifteen more

We'll eat your frigging entrails and we won't give a damn

My brother earned his medals at Mai Lei in Vietnam

The Pogues,"As I walked down by the riverside
One evening in the spring
Heard a long gone song
From days gone by
Blown in on the great North wind

Though there is no lonesome corncrake's cry
Of sorrow and delight
You can hear the cars
And the shouts from bars
And the laughter and the fights

May the ghosts that howled
Round the house at night
Never keep you from your sleep
May they all sleep tight
Down in hell tonight
Or wherever they may be

As I walked on with a heavy heart
Then a stone danced on the tide
And the song went on
Though the lights were gone

And the North wind gently sighed
And an evening breeze coming from the East
That kissed the riverside
So I pray now child that you sleep tonight

When you hear this lullaby
May the wind that blows from haunted graves
Never bring you misery
May the angels bright

Watch you tonight
And keep you while you sleep",Lullaby of London
The Pogues,"Have you ever walked the lonesome hills and heard the curlews cry?
Or seen the raven black as night upon a windswept sky?
To walk the purple heather and hear the westwind cry
To know that's where the rapparee must die

Since Cromwell pushed us westward to live our lowly lives
Some of us have deemed to fight from Tipperary mountains high
Noble men with wills of iron who are not afraid to die
And who'll fight with Gaelic honor held on high

A curse upon you Oliver Cromwell, you who raped our Motherland
I hope you're rotting down in hell for the horrors that you sent
To our misfortunate forefathers whom you robbed of their birthright
""To hell or Connaught"" may you burn in hell tonight

Of one such man I'd like to speak a rapparee by name and deed
His family dispossessed and slaughtered they put a price upon his head
His name is known in song and story and his deeds are legends still
And murdered for blood money was young Ned of the hill

And you've robbed our homes and fortunes, even drove us from the land
You tried to break our spirit but you'll never understand
The love of dear old Ireland that will forge an iron will
As long as there are gallant men like young Ned of the hill

A curse upon you Oliver Cromwell, you who raped our Motherland
I hope you're rotting down in hell for the horrors that you sent
To our misfortunate forefathers whom you robbed of their birthright
""To hell or Connaught"" may you burn in hell tonight",Young Ned of the Hill

Purple mad pain

The circus is over
Exit the clowns
Nobody's laughing
Down in Oretown

The ship's in the harbor
Cargo's been pawned
Barrooms spilling sailors
All shipwrecked at dawn

Smelling of salt and rust
Uniform's torn
Came looking for flowers
Only found thorns

Dreaming of mermaids
In pearly white gowns
Captain is sleeping
Down in Oretown

There's a man down on mainstreet
Eyes all aflame
Laughing in the thunder
Of the Number 9 train

Selling old postcards in rusty frames
A thousand views of Oretown
And they all look the same

Dressed up in sandals
A barbed wire crown
A lot of people lost their minds
Down in Oretown

Lock up the lawman
Let go the thief
Round up the grey men
Nail them to a tree

This town was a palace
This town was aglow
Well, the sky burned orange
And the iron river flowed

The night stank of diesel
A stranger came to town
The night folded over
Down in Oretown

The Pogues,"Tosspint rises early
Sprung from a nightmare's claw
Thrice crows the dawn cock
The mist is on the moor

Tosspint cries from croaking gills
Thank God I'm not forsaken
From the hellish depths of sleep
At last I am awakened

Tosspint flushed his kidneys
Rained a golden shower
Pleased to piss a good pot full
He shat upon the hour

Tosspint filled his belly
With tripe and ox's tongue
Sucking pig stuffed with figs
Into his guts he flung

Full belly and the dance is merry
Where hunger reigns no strength obtains
The wheel spins, the gurdy hums
Ring the bells and beat the drum

Tosspint drinks lustily
And pees against the sun
All around the hoary oak
The laughing maidens run

Tosspint warms his codpiece
To the flour adds the yeast
In the field by Tanner's Mill
He plays to two-backed beast

Twist the spigot, close the hole
Stoke the fire and blow the coal
The wheel spins, the gurdy hums
Ring the bells and beat the drum

[Incomprehensible]
Where hunger reigns no strength obtains
The wheel spins, the gurdy hums
Ring the bells and beat the drum

Tosspint fell foul of dogma
And slipped into a schism
The trial was quick, the sky grew dark
They led him from the prison

Tied him to a stake of oak
Lit a fire of wood and coke
The crowd sang out ""His bacon's smoked!""
The bells rang out ""Tosspint's croaked!""

Tosspint under flaming sky
Walks through the fires of Hell
Where bestial demons threw the damned
Screaming as they fell

Into the pits of burning coals
Tosspint throws up his last bowl
Mingled with the soup
His soul

Tosspint rises early
Sprung from a nightmare's claw
Thrice crows the dawn cock
The mist is on the moor

Twist the spigot, close the hole
Stoke the fire and blow the coal
The wheel spins, the gurdy hums
Ring the bells and beat the drum

And all our love's together
Must I recall again
Joy would always follow
After pain

Hands holding hands
Let us stand face to face
While underneath the bridge
Of our arms entwined slow race
Eternal gazes flowing
At waves pace

Let night fall, let the hours go by
The days pass on and here stand I

Love runs away
Like running water flows
Love flows away
But oh, how slow life goes
How violent is hope
Love only knows

Let night fall, let the hours go by
The days pass on and here stand I

The days flow ever on
The weeks pass by in vain
Time never will return
Nor our loves burn again

The Pogues,"When I was a young man I carried my pack
And I lived the free life of a rover
From the murrays green basin to the dusty outback
I waltzed my matilda all over
Then in nineteen fifteen my country said son
It's time to stop rambling 'cause there's work to be
Done
So they gave me a tin hat and they gave me a gun
And they sent me away to the war
And the band played Waltzing Matilda
As we sailed away from the quay
And amidst all the tears and the shouts and the
Cheers
We sailed off to Gallipoli

How well I remember that terrible day
When the blood stained the sand and the water
And how in that hell that they called suvla bay
We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter
Johnny Turk he was ready, he primed himself well
He showered us with bullets, he rained us with
Shells
And in five minutes flat he'd blown us all to hell
Nearly blew us right back to Australia
But the band played waltzing Matilda
As we stopped to bury our slain
And we buried ours and the Turks buried theirs
Then it started all over again

Now those who were living did their best to survive
In that mad world of blood, death and fire
And for seven long weeks I kept myself alive
While the corpses around me piled higher
Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over tit
And when I woke up in my hospital bed
And saw what it had done, Christ I wished I was
Dead
Never knew there were worse things than dying
And no more I'll go waltzing Matilda
To the green bushes so far and near
For to hump tent and pegs, a man needs two legs
No more waltzing Matilda for me

So they collected the cripples, the wounded and
Maimed
And they shipped us back home to Australia
The legless, the armless, the blind and insane
Those proud wounded heroes of suvla
And as our ship pulled into circular quay
I looked at the place where me legs used to be
And thank Christ there was nobody waiting for me
To grieve and to mourn and to pity
And the band played Waltzing Matilda
As they carried us down the gangway
But nobody cheered, they just stood and stared
And they turned all their faces away

And now every April I sit on my porch
And I watch the parade pass before me
I see my old comrades, how proudly they march
Reliving the or their dreams of past glory
i see the old men, all twisted and torn
The forgotten heroes of a forgotten war
And the young people ask me, ""what are they
Marching for?""
And I ask myself the same question
And the band plays Waltzing Matilda
And the old men still answer to the call
But year after year their numbers get fewer
Some day no one will march there at all

Where the water lilies grow
And on the jukebox johnny sang

About a thing called love
And it's how are you kid and what's your name
And how would you bloody know?
In blood and death 'neath a screaming sky

I lay down on the ground
And the arms and legs of other men
Were scattered all around
Some cursed, some prayed, some prayed then cursed

Then prayed and bled some more
And the only thing that I could see
Was a pair of brown eyes that was looking at me
But when we got back, labeled parts one to three
There was no pair of brown eyes waiting for me

And a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go
For a pair of brown eyes

I looked at him he looked at me
All I could do was hate him
While ray and Philomena sang
Of my elusive dream

I saw the streams, the rolling hills
Where his brown eyes were waiting
And I thought about a pair of brown eyes
That waited once for me

So drunk to hell I left the place
Sometimes crawling sometimes walking
A hungry sound came across the breeze
So I gave the walls a talking

And I heard the sounds of long ago
From the old canal
And the birds were whistling in the trees
Where the wind was gently laughing

Where the cold grey waters ripple
In the misty morning light
Held a match to your cigarette
Watched the smoke curl in the mist

In a faraway place
The sun fell cold upon my face
The cracks in the ceiling spelt hell
Turned to the wall
Pulled the sheets around my head
Tried to sleep, and dream my way

The Pogues,"Jesse James we understand
Has killed many a man
He robbed the union trains
He stole from the rich
And gave to the poor
He'd a hand and a heart
And a brain

Now Jesse had a wife
Lived a lady all her life
And children they were brave
But history does record
That Bob and Charlie ford
Have laid poor Jesse in his grave

They robbed the Glendale train

It was those outlays

Lived a lady all her life
And children they were brave

Those dirty little cowards
I wonder how they feel
For they ate of Jesse's bread
And they slept in Jesse's bed
And they laid poor Jesse in his grave

They wondered how he came to fall

The Pogues,"One summer evening drunk to hell
I stood there nearly lifeless
An old man in the corner sang
Where the water lilies grow
And on the jukebox johnny sang
About a thing called love
And its how are you kid and whats your name
And how would you bloody know?
In blood and death neath a screaming sky
I lay down on the ground
And the arms and legs of other men
Were scattered all around
Some cursed, some prayed, some prayed then cursed
Then prayed and bled some more
And the only thing that I could see
Was a pair of brown eyes that was looking at me
But when we got back, labeled parts one to three
There was no pair of brown eyes waiting for me

And a rovin a rovin a rovin Ill go
For a pair of brown eyes

I looked at him he looked at me
All I could do was hate him
While ray and philomena sang
Of my elusive dream
I saw the streams, the rolling hills
Where his brown eyes were waiting
And I thought about a pair of brown eyes
That waited once for me
So drunk to hell I left the place
Sometimes crawling sometimes walking
A hungry sound came across the breeze
So I gave the walls a talking
And I heard the sounds of long ago
From the old canal
And the birds were whistling in the trees
Where the wind was gently laughing

And a rovin a rovin a rovin Ill go
For a pair of brown eyes",A Pair of Brown Eyes
The Pogues,"Of all the money that e'er I spent
I've spent it in good company
And all the harm that ever I did
Alas, it was to none but me

And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all

If I had money enough to spend
And leisure to sit awhile
There is a fair maid in the town
That sorely has my heart beguiled

Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips
I own she has my heart enthralled
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all

Oh, all the comrades that e'er I had
They're sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They'd wish me one more day to stay

But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and softly call
Good night and joy be with you all

The Pogues,"I've been loving you a long time
Down all the years, down all the days
And I've cried for all your troubles
Smiled at your funny little ways

We watched our friends grow up together
And we saw them as they fell
Some of them fell into Heaven
Some of them fell into Hell

I took shelter from a shower
And I stepped into your arms
On a rainy night in Soho
The wind was whistling all its charms

I sang you all my sorrows
You told me all your joys
Whatever happened to that old song
To all those little girls and boys

Sometimes I wake up in the morning
The ginger lady by my bed
Covered in a cloak of silence
I hear you talking in my head

I'm not singing for the future
I'm not dreaming of the past
I'm not talking of the first time
I never think about the last

And memory fades as the years pass you by
Sometimes the truth's got up, lay down and died

Sometimes I try to pretend it's alright

Still in the morning I run and I hide
'cause I can't forget all the tears that I cried

But I'll get fooled like the last time
Oh how these eyes are sore
They'll cry again just like before

Lonely the track I decided to take
Lost from the start all the friendships I make
Single fares only the trails only I ride

Too much reminiscing is bad for the soul
It screws up your life and it makes you feel old
Don't want to remember what I can't abide

We got him out the back and we broke his fucking balls

To lie and faint within your silken bosom
Within your silken bosom as that does now.
Or would I were a little burnish'd apple
For you to pluck me, gliding by so cold
While sun and shade you robe of lawn will dapple
Your robe of lawn, and you hair's spun gold.

Yeah, would to God I were among the roses
That lean to kiss you as you float between
While on the lowest branch a bud uncloses
A bud uncloses, to touch you, queen.

Might press me going even unto death.",Danny Boy [BBC John Peel Show]

The Pogues,"It was 1962 
I was two years out of school 
When I got on board a boat 
That was bound for Liverpool 
The day I went away 
I remember it so well 
Said goodbye to the North Wall 
And bid a fond farewell 

When I got down to the smoke 
It was 1963 
I got a job doing meals on wheels 
Round NW3 
I was terrorising grannies
For ten lousy bob a week
I was smashed and blacked
And drunk and yawning in NW3 

In the filth and piss they lived in 
They would sometimes hum an air 
Or talk in tongues of madness 
Keeping time upon a chair 
And for their wrists a numbered tab 
In Westminster morgue 
On a cold hard slab 
When I was still a young man 
In NW3 

Now I'm spent of love and rage
And I'm going home again
Never did nobody wrong
Never earned a decent wage
So thanks for sweet fuck all
Once more look at the North Wall
Say goodbye to all of that
And bid a fond farewell

At the top of the Pentonville Road 
I watched the sun setting 
The town spread out before me 
Looked beautiful to me 
Away from all the sighing
The suffering and the dying
I dreamed of the future 
Of the young and the free 

But the years they went by quickly 
Now I swear I won't return here 
Where each day just bring me closer 
To the final misery

Down among the pigs, played some hearty rigs
Danced some hearty jigs, the water round me bubblin'

I just want to tell you nothing
You don't want to hear

The Pogues,"I've been loving you a long time
Down all the years, down all the days
And I've cried for all your troubles
Smiled at your funny little ways

We watched our friends grow up together
And we saw them as they fell
Some of them fell into Heaven
Some of them fell into Hell

I took shelter from a shower
And I stepped into your arms
On a rainy night in Soho
The wind was whistling all its charms

I sang you all my sorrows
You told me all your joys
Whatever happened to that old song
To all those little girls and boys?

Now, the song is nearly over
We may never find out what it means
But there's a light I hold before me
And you're the measure of my dreams, the measure of my dreams

Sometimes I'd wake up in the morning
The ginger lady by my bed
Covered in a cloak of silence
I'd hear you talking in my head

I'm not singing for the future
I'm not dreaming of the past
I'm not talking of the first times
I never think about the last

Now, the song is nearly over
We may never find out what it means
Still, there's a light I hold before me
You're the measure of my dreams, the measure of my dreams",Rainy Night in Soho
The Pointed Sticks,"On big alley stands a lady waiting
For awhile
Acting out an untold story like a 
Wounded child
But the mystery of the circumstance
Won't hide
She believes true love survives
True love survives

Waiting for her long lost lover
Returning from the war
Though I know she knew the truth
She also knew much more
And the answer that she gave to all of us
Whispered low saying
True love survives
True love survives

Is she dreaming does she know
A secret I can't see
Maybe there's a trace of truth
In all that she believes

For one day I took a look deep down inside
A voice cried saying true love's alive
True love survives

Only love will last forever true love will survive
Only love will last forever true love will survive

True is love is never-ending
It's giving all and not pretending
It's holding on although your heart 
Feels dead

A quarter of a century of years 
Have gone by
Still the dream of this peculiar 
Lady's kept alive
So I'm holding tight to one who I desired
A burning fire saying true love survives
True love survives

Only love will last forever
Only love will last forever",True Love
The Pointer Sisters,"Yeah, it's just more drama, it's kinda funny, 
Things you go through in your lifetime, 
Sometimes you just can't explain it, well, 
Do women do what men do, if you don't think 
So, explain this to me, keep it real

Tell me where you were last night
I caught you in another lie
See you been creepin' for so long
You see I had this feeling (feelin')
That you ain't never been true
Shit you said you did not do
Confessions goin' down tonight (down tonight)
See you won't get a chance to me no more lies

You know you ain't right
Been livin' double lives
Creepin' on the low

You know you ain't right
Been livin' double lives
Creepin' on the low
You thought I wouldn't know
But I know babe

See you mistake me for a fool
Thought you could walk on me like a shoe (oh no)
Steady carryin' dirt through this house
I gotta call that you were seein' across town
I never thought you stoop so low, never, never
This far I thought you'd never go, never, never
But like a card game you played yourself
Now play the game with someone else
Because you ain't right

[Chorus]

I know about the jeep with the chromed out rims
I know about the club and the late night meals
I know about the conversation on the phone
I know about the nights that you didn't come home

Cause you been livin'
And you've been givin'
And you've been creepin'
On the low, on the low
And I gotta let you know
It's all right, it's all right
It's OK, it's OK

The Pointer Sisters,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Old Songs: That's a Plenty/Bei Mir Bist du Shoen
The Pointer Sisters,"I'm feelin' mighty lonesome 
Haven't slept a wink 
I walk the floor from nine to four 
In between I drink

In this weekday rue 

I'm talkin to the shadow 
One o'clock till four 
And Lord, how slow the moments go 
And all I do is pour 
Black coffee 
Since the blues caught my eye 
I'm hangin' out on Monday 
My Sunday dreams to dry 

Now man was born to go a lovin' 
But was a woman born to weep and fret
And stay at home and tend her oven 
And down her past regrets 
In coffee and cigarettes 

I'm moonin' all the mornin' 
Moanin' all the night 
And in between it's nicotine 
And not much heart to fight

Might maybe come around 
Come around",Black Coffee

The Pointer Sisters,"Kept the dream alive
Just why I don't know
You kept me hangin' on
If you really loved me
You'd have let me go
There's no time for regret
'Cause darling I know

Someday we'll be together
Someday, some time in the future
You will turn around
See it's nowhere to be found
And you'll come running back
To me
Someday we'll be together

You played your part so well
You really had me fooled 
That big breakdown scene
But think about it now
Oh it was cruel
And it was mean
Oh, but when I think of 
When I think of, of how it could've been

Someday we'll be together
Someday, some time in the future
You will turn around
See it's nowhere to be found
And you'll come running back
To me
Someday we'll be together

When each love burns out
And it will without a doubt
You'll come running back
Back to me, oh
Yes you will, you'll see, yeah

Someday we'll be together
Someday, some time in the future
You will turn around
See it's nowhere to be found
And you'll come running back

Someday we'll be together

The Pointer Sisters,"Thanks to houtvanmark@hotmail.com for these lyrics.
 I'll pack up all my things and walk away,
 I don't want to hear another word you have to say
 I've been waiting for so long,
 And just found out there's something wrong
 Nothing will get better if I stay
 There's no need to explain anymore
 I tried my best to love you,
 Now I'm walkin' out the door
 (Walkin' out the door)
 You used me, you deceived me,
 And you never seem to need me
 But I bet, you won't forget me when I go
 Oh no, no, no
 Seems I've been lost in a dream
 Pretending that you care
 But now I've opened up my eyes
 And found it's all been just a great big fairytale
 I've been lovin' you so long
 Don't think I even know how to forget you
 But now the way that things have been
 I think I'm better off alone than to be with you
 You don't love me it's plain to see
 There's no need to explain anymore
 I tried my best to love you,
 Now I'm walkin' out the door
 (Walkin' out the dor)
 Ahh, you used me, you deceived me,
 And you never seem to need me
 But I'll bet you won't forget me when I go
 Oh no, no, no
 Seems I've been lost in a dream
 Pretending you were mine
 Someday you'll open up your eyes
 And realize that a good woman's hard to find
 Yes I've been lost in a dream
 Pretending that you care
 But now I've opened up my eyes
 And found it's all been just a great big fairytale",Fairytale [Single Version]
The Pointer Sisters,"When I first saw him standin' there
I longed to speak but did not care
Something inside whispered to me
You'd better move in carefully

And then he smiled and turned away
That told me all he could not say
That's when I knew
He wanted me too
But I had to do some breakin' through

He's so shy
He's so shy
That sweet little boy who caught my eye
He's so shy
He's so shy
And he's much too good to let get by, oh yes he is

Now holding him gently through the night
Nothin' has ever felt so right
And I'm so glad I took the time
That I had to take to make him mine

He can still do things to my heart
Just like he did right from the start
Each time I see
That quality
That never stops attracting me

He's so shy (so good looking)
He's so shy (he really got me going)
That sweet little boy who caught my eye
He's so shy (I'm so glad I got to know him)
He's so shy ('cause he's one in a million)
And I'll love him until the day I die
Oh, yes I will

He's so shy (that's why I love my baby)
He's so shy (you know he's driving me crazy)
That sweet little boy who caught my eye
He's so shy (I've got a long time to know him)
He's so shy (I'm so glad I got to show him)

Your camera looks through me with it's X-ray visions

My legs too weak to stand
I go from sadness to exhilaration

Flowers arrive
Who else would think of that but my guy
He's all heart and all mine
Ooh, and I don't have to be Miss Perfect One
For him to love what he sees
I can feel it in the little things he does
What I found he's every woman's dream

My baby he's a goldmine
Ooh, what he does just keeps my heart in love
My baby he's a goldmine
Ooh, all he does just keeps me here in love

Five times a day
He calls me up to say, ""How ya doin' babe?""
He's just that way
Leaves me little notes by my coffee cup
The sweetest poetry to me
Ooh, and every night he tells me with his touch
The way he moves just makes me want to scream

His eyer were fire, my heart was cold
My arms were ready for new love to hold
He makes me feel something that I've never known
When you find someone like him, you don't let go

Girl's got a goldmine and he's so fine
Girl's got a goldmine and he's all mine
Baby's got a goldmine, treats me so kind
Loves me rain or shine, my baby's divine

I can feel the little things that he does
What I found is every woman's dream

The Pointer Sisters,"Now's the time for all good men
To get together with one another.
We got to iron out our problems
And iron out our quarrels
And try to live as brothers.
And try to find a piece of land
Without stepping on one another.
And do respect the women of the world.
Remember you all have mothers.
We got to make this land a better land
Than the world in which we live.
And we got to help each man be a better man
With the kindness that we give.
I know we can make it.
I know darn well we can work it out.
Oh yes we can, I know we can can
Yes we can can, why can't we?
If we wanna get together we can work it out.

And we gotta take care of all the children,
The little children of the world.
'Cause they're our strongest hope for the future,
The little bitty boys and girls.

I was blue and lonely,
I couldn't sleep a wink
And I could only get unconscious
If I'd had to much to drink

There was somehow, something wrong somewhere,
And each day seemed grey and dead
The seeds of desperation
Were growing in me head

I needed inspiration,
A brand new start in life,
Somewhere to place affection,
But I didn't want a wife

And then by lucky chance I saw
In a special magazine
An ad that was unusual,
The like I'd never seen,

""Experience something different
With our new imported toy,
She's loving, warm, inflatable
And a guarantee of joy""

She came all wrapped in cardboard,
All pink and shriveled down
A breath of air was all she needed
To make her lose that frown

I took her to the bedroom
And pumped her with some life,
And later in a moment
That girl became my wife

And so I sit her in the corner
And sometimes stroke her hair
And when I'm feeling naughty
I blow her up with air

She's cuddly and she's bouncy,
She's like a rubber ball,
I bounce her in the kitchen
And I bounce her in the hall

And now my life is different
Since Sally came my way
I wake up in the morning
And have her on a tray

She's everything they say she was
And I wear a permanent grin,
And I only have to worry
In case my girl wears thin

Won't you be my girl

By killing everybody in the human race

There really isn't any need for bloodshed

And anybody else you find a bore

You will make some sense of this
And when you've made your secret journey
You will find this love you miss

I strained to understand him

Grandmother screaming at the wall
We have to shout above the din of our rice crispies
We can't hear anything at all

Mother chants her litany of boredom and frustration
But we know all her suicides are fake
Daddy only stares into the distance
There's only so much more that he can take
Many miles away something crawls from the slime
At the bottom of a dark Scottish lake

Another industrial ugly morning
The factory belches filth into the sky
He walks unhindered through the picket lines today,
He doesn't think to wonder why

The secretaries pout and preen like cheap tarts in a red light street,
But all he ever thinks to do is watch,
And every single meeting with his so-called superior
Is a humiliating kick in the crotch
Many miles away something crawls to the surface
Of a dark Scottish loch

Another working day has ended
Only the rush hour hell to face
Packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes
Contestants in a suicidal race

Daddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distance
He knows that something somewhere has to break
He sees the family home now, looming in his headlights
The pain upstairs that makes his eyeballs ache
Many miles away there's a shadow on the door
Of a cottage on the shore

And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads

Grandmother screaming at the wall
We have to shout above the din of our rice crispies
We can't hear anything at all

Mother chants her litany of boredom and frustration
But we know all her suicides are fake
Daddy only stares into the distance
There's only so much more that he can take
Many miles away something crawls from the slime
At the bottom of a dark Scottish lake

Another industrial ugly morning
The factory belches filth into the sky
He walks unhindered through the picket lines today,
He doesn't think to wonder why

The secretaries pout and preen like cheap tarts in a red light street,
But all he ever thinks to do is watch,
And every single meeting with his so-called superior
Is a humiliating kick in the crotch
Many miles away something crawls to the surface
Of a dark Scottish loch

Another working day has ended
Only the rush hour hell to face
Packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes
Contestants in a suicidal race

Daddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distance
He knows that something somewhere has to break
He sees the family home now, looming in his headlights
The pain upstairs that makes his eyeballs ache

Of a cottage on the shore
Of a dark Scottish lake

This girl's an open page
Book marking she's so close now
This girl is half his age

Don't stand to close to me
Her friends are so jealous
You know how bad girls get
Sometimes it's not so easy
To be the teacher's pet
Temptation, frustration
So bad it makes him cry
Wet bus stop, she's waiting
His car is warm and dry

Don't stand so close to me
Loose talk in the classroom
To hurt they try and try
Strong words in the staffroom
The accusations fly
It's no use
He sees her
He starts to shake he starts to cough
Just like the old man in
That book by Nabokov

Is a humiliating kick in the crotch.

Packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes.

So many mothers sighing
News had just come over
We had five years left to sigh in

News guy wept and squarely told us
Earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet
Then I knew he was not lying

I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and TVs
My brain hurt like a warehouse, had no room to spare
I had to cram so much everything in there

All the fat-skinny people
And all the tall-short people
And all the nobody people
And all the somebody people
Never thought I'd need so many people

A girl my age went off her head
Hit some tiny children
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off
I think she would have killed them

A soldier with a broken arm
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that

And I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour
Drinking milk shakes, cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Don't think you knew you were in this song

And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race, the way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got

We've got five years stuck on my eyes

She bends her knees and tries to scream and says its time to go.

'Cause when you shook me, took me outta my world, I woke up
Suddenly I just woke up to the happening
When you find that you left the future behind
'Cause when you got a tender love you don't take care of
Then you better beware of

One day you're up, when you turn around
You find your world is tumbling down
It happened to me and it can happen to you

I was sure, I felt secure until love took a detour
Yeah!  Riding high on top of the world, it happened
Suddenly it just happened
I saw my dreams torn apart
When love walked away from my heart
And when you lose a precious love you need to guide you
Something happens inside you

Now I see life for what it is
It's not of dreams, it's not of bliss
It happened to me and it can happen to you
And then it happened

Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.

Saturday is close behind
Then you sleep in Sunday morning
Monday back out on the line

You're not to blame 'cause you were never
Made aware

(that) it all comes back
In good time and that's a fact
It's all right--at least for now

A healthy dose of deep depression
Keeps you comfertably smug

Once you had your own direction
And all your thoughts were clean and clear
Now gazing at your own reflection
Makes you want to smash the mirror
You can never listen but I know that
You can hear

You can always think that you're wrong
But never say you're sorry
For something that you've never (x2) done

The Posies,"Well I've felt worse and I have felt
Better than this
I've made a pacifier
Out of my fist

Well I don't care when bones are bare
The mind can't interfere
And what I've said outside my head
Anyone can hear

Maybe I praise you 'cause I cannot praise myself
Won't you just take
A compliment from me?

Perhaps they're understated
And a little overmasked
If they were hand delivered
It would be more than I could ask

Forwardness ain't my business
But you can fish for compliments
While I beg for forgiveness

I'd like to reap the flatteries I sow
But I really cast seeds of doubt
Looks like you take them from everyone
And everyone hands them out

Self mutilation just ain't my trip
But now this is worth the trouble
Cut me open with your laughter
I bleed complementary colors

Tender seedlings trampled
And overwatered boughs
Won't you just take
A compliment from me?

Perhaps they're overstated
And a little undermasked
If they were what I really meant
It would be more than I could ask

Forwardness should be my business
But you can fish for compliments
While I beg for forgiveness

Well I have tried every approach
And they always leave me empty
But each one has it's special way
Of making everyone contempt me

It seems rather selfish to want to be loved
Or to love and expect you to care
But my batteries don't run on flattery
And it just gets me nowhere

Oh when was I ever promised
I'd get back all that I gave?
But I wouldn't care if you'd take
A compliment from me

Perhaps it's too late
Or too much to expect
But compliments that come no strings attached
Well, they're certainly the best
Thing for me, I adore you
But you can fish for compliments
And I won't be there to bore you

Then ignore me at the party

Perhaps you'd reveal that you actually like me
Did you ever think that I'd just bow out quietly
All I wish is sometimes you would sit down next to me

And if you would like me too (x2)

Well maybe I can't force you to
Stand up and obey my will
I doubt you'll ever touch me or
Love me which is bettter still
I deified you once but
Now I'm standing on your hill
I see you eye to eye
And you're shrinking out of my sight
So before you have passed my line
Let's lower ourselves to each other

Thinly tie me to myself though you
Remain so free
I've tried in vain to demonstrate how you're
Tied as well to me
But you'll come around eventually


Practice makes perfect and you practice perfection
But it's just a stage and I hope that some day when you're done

And in your times of trouble
I could keep you alive

Chorus
You're really not that different
You're just like everyone
You go under easy when you get overdone

I've seen your situation
Happen before
And if you say you'll listen
I will tell you more
But I get the impression that you don't want to hear it
That whatever I say will not make a difference
None of my words will ever
Make you realize
And on you own you'll never
Learn to compromise

Chorus (we all go under easy...)

Under all of us is the same ground
It's so easy to get knocked off of your feet
In spite of everything you let yourself down
'cause on your feet you only stand to be corrected
Well in reality that's to be expected
It's something you should have expected a long time ago

Well it's really no excuse and aren't you self abuse
Are you really seeking savation (I've tried to explain)
Moutains have been moved and theories have been proved
All within the duration (all you do is complain)
So when your show is over and all is said and done
I think it fair of me to say that you're not the only one
Who's acted like you had until their world has blown asunder
Either swim for your life or I'll watch you go under

You think that you're exceptional, you're just like everyone
We all go under easy

(repeat under all of us...corrected)
And you can argue that you've been misdirected
Well in reality that's to be expected
It's something you should have accepted (x3)
A long time ago

Can cause you to to blind more than twice

The wounds you never bled
Just aggravate your head until they've gone

You will verify and vocalize

From which everyone moves away, everyone moves away

Etched upon your memory, like the way that we were raised
In our backyard we were left no time to think
The blood that turned to ink splelled neglect
Now there's no sun and the grass is overgrown
The sacred seed they've sown is utterly alone and scared to death
But you will free yourself
You will cut the cord and cauterize

Education wasn't fun, but now that school is done
Higher learning's just begun
(Chorus)
You're gonna watch what you say for a long time
You're gonna suffer the guilt forever
You're gonna get in the way at the wrong time
You're gonna mess up things you thought you would never
Disappointment breeds contempt, it make you feel inept
Never thought you'd feel alone (at home)
His and hers forever more, throw your freedom out of the door
Before you find out what it's for
(Chorus)
Four weeks seemed like a long time then - but nine months is longer now
But even if you never speak again - you've already made the wedding vow
(Chorus)
Honeymoons will never start, bonds will blow apart
Just as fast as they were made
Men and women please beware : don't pretend you care
Nothing lasts when nothing's there
(Repeat Chorus)",Golden Blunders
The Posies,"When we met we still had innocence
And we did things 'cause they made sense
Without trying hard I made it final
And we conceived our children on backseat vinyl
Though we didn't have a lot
(But) one was quickly bought
Then we buit upon this ground something we thought was sound
But in reality was silence
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I only picked up your story knowing you were lying
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help yourself
When I look back now I plainly see
The misery I'm sure you don't agree
And all the products of those peaceful years
The broken plates and glasses and the shouting hurt my ears
Sometimes I wish I was asleep
And you were just another sheep
And when we finally fell apart
You were left holding the cart
Though you thought I'd said I'd push it
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I keep dropping those hints but they never touched the ground
I'm useless to you now
You'll have to learn yourself to help yourself
I had never planned on this being so complicated
You had never planned on us being so separated
The spiteful words will heal with time
Eventually they rhyme
You can forget but not forgive the fact that I still live
And never wanted you to give... in
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
You weren't satisfied I was only superhuman
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help...
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
Well I could only stand sitting here so long
You don't need my help
You'll have to learn to help yourself

The Posies,"The lines across your face are drawn with hate
Cause I'm drawn to someone else
(looks like you could use a little sleep)
I had some I didn't mention
You caught me coming late (framed by the door)
Onto a floor that's freshly waxed
And hides my tracks and raises
Some important questions

I ask you to be nice - it has no effect
And I suspect that you suspect
But didn't I say feelings are the last things to make themselves felt? 

Don't make me explain myself - you don't need to know
What's going on in my big head right now
It could appear that I should have a statement prepared, but
Don't make me open my big mouth

The words come quickly I feel sick
I use that for an excuse to exit
Looks like you don't buy it
And I'm trying your patience
But what I leave unsaid sticks in my head
The guilt puts me in a spotlight
Looks like I might reveal
You're not my sole engagement

I ask you to shut up - it's as I didn't
Know myself I wish you didn't
Know that I can't turn back, but I didn't plan to tell you that

Don't make me explain myself - you don't need to know
What's going on in my big head right now
It could appear that I could want to defend me, but
Don't make me open my big mouth

You tell me to get out - I can't get out of it
And I wish that we both could split
But splitting doesn't mean the end of the backlash that I couldn't defend

Don't make me explain myself - you wouldn't like what you find
Inside my, inside my big head
It could appear that I would want to reassure your doubts
Don't make me open my big mouth

Don't make me, don't make me,
Don't make me, don't make me,
Don't make me open my big mouth

The Posies,"Isn't it nice how things resolve
To test your will would take the skill of crazy ants
You fit your mind into smaller and smaller jars
You find them clutching the last straw
As if it's worth the worse for wear and tear you look
But why try to understand someone that you don't even know
Even though he brought you up, beat you up,
Shut you up when you cried ?
And now you avoid parties
Because they remind you
Of someone who you used to know
Pretty soon you'll want to avoid yourself
A popular phrase from the same year
Would draw no tears save for the fears of looking back
You find you hide for weaker and weaker reasons
The battle you lost in the mirror
Earned you no thanks but wooden planks were soon withdrawn
And you couldn't run away even if you tried
And you tried and you cried 'cause you knew that laying flat
In your parents' car
And now you avoid father
Because they remind you
Of someone who you used to know
Pretty soon you'll want to avoid your own
And now you're finally on your own
You draw your choices from the voices you despise
You find you're drawn to tighter and tighter circles
Flashbacks, flashes forward
You are insane though you have gained such wide appeal
And all the car rides, cheap insides, laughter at the right people
At the right time at the right line in the right frame of mind
And now you avoid thinking
Because it reminds you of someone you used to know
Pretty soon you'll only think about yourself

Then why are we making apologies?
If we're in tune with harmony from melody
Then why are we still saying don't invite me?

The smartest people are victims
And everyone's entangled to their own opinions
I've had a few good senses of humor
But nothing's good humor til you have sense
Some were too under cautious
And the writer's left us nauseous so let's ?

Like a favor, like a glance, please return it, please return it

Hour of our trials, ours too sickening to live
Please return it
Put it back, I take it back, I can burn it

You didn't do it completely but you were discreet
Like the year I spent comparing me to you, please return it
Like a servant, like a sewer, please return it, please return it

Talking on the phone at night
You never tell me why
When it all goes down
And you know shit gets around
And rumors are true
I'll never have a friend quite as lovely again
And I'm not responsible for the ending that I know is inevitable
Yes, I understand you're happy now
And I understand your hand-me-down towel
Yes, I understand you're happy now
Better to be happy than to never know
Well it pins me to
An exaggerated view --
Correct me if I'm wrong
And it's man's best friend
And the tin's empty again
Degrade yourself now
I never took a pill wasn't guaranteed to thrill
And I ought to know you standing up sober
I ought to know your black & white look
I ought to know just like your dad told you
I ought to know mistakes you mis... took
You can paint it black
You can use thickest shellac
And still be see-through
And with everything I say
I mean it in the best way
To have it be true
And it's not impossible
For a friend to heed the slack behind the pull
Yes, I understand you're happy now
And I understand your hand-me-down towel
Yes, I understand you're happy now
Better to be happy
And I ought to know you standing up sober
I ought to know your black and white look

The Posies,"I remember giving up the gory details
And it left me tongue-tied (such an elementary sickness)
Now I don't want to think and I don't want to feel
I wasn't aware that this was part of the deal
When I put my finger on a greater expectation
But just my luck, I lack the patience of a statesman
And all of my language will fail to convey
That I'm terribly twisted around what I say
And the message I threw away

I don't have it now
I don't have it now
I don't have it now
I don't have it now

So I keep hiding and it only grows to hurt me
But time is wasting and I'm watching it desert me
I'm digging a hole and I'm making it deep
And I'm starting to question the hours that I keep
And the answer that I put to sleep

I don't have it now
I don't have it now
I don't have it now
I don't have it now

And so I'm writing with the hope that someone's reading
For all to likely runs the risk of me repeating
But I don't have the guts to prevent the decay
And I'm terribly twisted around what I say
And the courage that I threw away

I don't have it now

where everything was exactly how it seemed
where there was never any mystery
of who shot John F Kennedy
It was just a man with something to prove,
slightly bored and severely confused
He steadied his rifle with his target in the center
and became famous on that day in November

Don't wake me, I plan on sleeping in
Don't wake me, I plan on sleeping in
Don't wake me, I plan on sleeping in

Again last night I had that strange dream
where everything was exactly how it seemed
concerns about the world getting warmer
people thought that they were just being rewarded
for treating others as they'd like to be treated
for obeying stop signs and curing diseases
for mailing letters with the address of the sender
Now we can swim any day in November

Don't wake me, I plan on sleeping in (Now we can swim any day in November)

Yeah, she runs so she'll be free.
And of all the friends and enemies she's made along the way,
They are nowhere in her thoughts as she dives beneath the waves.

And he's the one that you've seen sometimes on TV,
And his shirt is on the ground while he's tackled by police.
And the parcel that he throws across the bridge into the creek,
It'll flow towards the sea, it will meet with her tomorrow.

No place, sometime.
We'll clear our eyes.
And when, you're down,
I'll come around.

And all, the places that she's been along the way.
Flames are licking at their walls. Night glows with their remains.
From far away the animals come gather round to see.
But she knows not how they feel and she knows not what it means.

When she was young we'd ask her what she'd like to be.
And she'd close her eyes and dream
Now we're nowhere in her thoughts as she dives beneath the waves.

No place, sometime.

Little plane tossed 'round by a southerly
And when I stepped outside the streets were clean

But I know deep down lies undiscovered
Past the bone foundations of a town corrupted
Under creaking piers, under iron cover
Past the concrete crime of a million lovers
Past strutting and swagger, under coldest rubble
Past torn down shanties of forgotten troubles
Through its ills and evils, past rants and ravings

Through fears and fervour, past lies and secrets
Of ink stained, panic-stricken 5 star heathens
Under storms of hell, through tropical fevers
Excitement of the first days of bushfire seasons
All those planning disasters, monuments to the masters
And the dog dark dealings of its backroom bastards
Every long lost dream, every failed endeavour
Every ice beer trail of a rum rebellion

Now I, huddle these feelings of pity
Watching new years colours rain down on the city
Where our beautiful beaches suffer photo ops
To watch schizophrenic tourists get shot by cops
Generation of kids with the toughest teeth
Still haunted by the visions of shocking ink
Where little old ladies die afraid and alone

Put some clothes on and call me

It was incredible

Slim, relax,
Fine wine at the (QFC)
On a snowy Saturday night
Black pearls and I swear you were drinkin' beer
You were the redhead behind the counter there
I'm the one who fell off his chair there
You had your dry-cleaning and I think you're dreaming

I saw you
It was incredible
Mumbled these words at you

The Presidents of the United States of America,"Get down
Let me tell you about a friend of mine
His name's Boll Weevil, check him out
Spends all day on his big butt
And he don't ever, ever get outside
I come to visit, I bring some sunshine
And I just spread it all over the fire
He's stuck on his big couch, stuck in his big shell
He looks at the TV and he's all right
I come from the Drug Lord, the local drug store
Bug is a fly, baby he's never uptight
And I wonder:
Boll Weevil, why don't you get out of your home?
He said, I'm comfortable here, I don't wanna move, I don't wanna leave
I said, Boll Weevil get right out of your home
Good bye, I gotta stay, I'll move some other day bye bye, gotta go to sleep
And let the tube shine, let the tube shine
Let the tube shine, let the tube shine
Now I would tell you about Boll Weevil, but that bug is just too scary
He's sittin there all alone, I try to coach him out, with chocolate pie
But he would not move a muscle, and I tried
To make him see that the sun is shining outside
Make him see that the sun is shining outside
Make him see that the sun is shining outside
Make him see that the sun is shining outside
Make him see that the sun is shining outside
Check it out

Make him see that the sun is shining outside

I didn't let that kind of shit go on too long

Had no idea it would cause so much trouble
When Greg tried to throw it back in the ocean

Don't ask me how, but the tiki found Bobby
He thought the idol was some Hawaiian hobby
Turned out the god was mean and vicious
Didn't respond to Bobby's 3 wishes
He had a Tiki God... saves him... he had a Tiki God

Your life's in danger and you can hear the shots
Your head is spinning and you're fading fast
How long do you think the kind of fun can last
Your luck will change with a simple motion

Splits the clouds and divides the sea
And shows those evil guys how nasty those tiki gods can be

When a man I did not know showed me the door
And told me I had to go
Well, that kind of humiliation never happens on farm
That's why city living does the psyche such harm
And I said...

Fire escapes don't work until there's a fire
You gotta sleep on the floor
Live in the mud
There's no need to go higher
Once you taste a brick, you won't want more
Saving sanity is no trick when your livin' outdoors

Well, it did not take me long to realize my mistake
When garbage trucks messed up my dreams, I knew my dreams were fake
Don't know how people gonna live like this
Pigeons might enjoy it but I can't live in this mess, and I said...

Fire escapes don't work until there's a fire
You gotta sleep on the floor
Live in the mud
There's no need to go higher
Once you taste a brick, you can't chew and talk
Saving sanity is no trick when your livin' in a room the size of a shoe box

So, finally, all the wires and plastic got to me
Ideas and realizations were passing right through me
I did not take a train, a plane, or bus with wings
Man wasn't meant to fly
Besides, walking does the same thing: gets me outta here

Fire escapes don't work until there's a fire
You gotta sleep on the floor
Live in the mud
There's no need to go higher
Once you taste a brick, you won't want more
Saving sanity is a trick when you're livin' on someone else's floor

Cooling effect she uses to smooth her temper

Where I've never been
I've been thinking 'bout finding out
How to find the end

And I've been thinking 'bout freaking out
If I can just find the time
And these ideas are leaking out
So put a plug in my mind

Now I'm thinking 'bout sneaking out
With nowhere to go
I'm considering dropping out
Stepping out of the flow

Off all these radar scopes
To a place far below
And I'm finally finding out
How to lighten my load
I'm considering dropping out

I've been thinking 'bout crawling out
From underneath
I've been thinking 'bout heading out

But I've got a sin to confess

Tore my heart in two
And I had to lay him eight feet under ground

Now all I need is someone to save me
'Cause I am going down
And what I need is someone to save me
'Cause I am going down
All the way down

Well hey there father there is just one other thing,
I have a simple request,
I hear you know god could you give him a nod in my direction,
I would be in your debt, perhaps
There is something that we could work out,
I noticed your breathing has started to change,
We could go in the back behind all
These stacks of bibles and get out of this cage

Tore my heart in two

Now all I need is someone to save me
'Cause I am going down

All the way down

I didn't wanna do it father but I caught him
With another woman in the bed I made
And so I put him in the grave
And now there's no one left around
To get me off when I want its a drag
The next day on the television they identified him
By the circumcision that I made
And now I'm on the run but wait
Why did I have to go and kill him
When he was the best I ever had

Dear boy what are you running from?
Everyone has got to be saved
I have heard a voice
If it came down to make a choice
I would be the one to play

Time keeps rolling on (I need my)
Time keeps rolling on (I need my absolution)

Run boy, be a man
With legs too weak to make a stand
We're all crucified in the end
Can you hear a voice to separate through all this noise?
You'll be left with nothing again

Time keeps rolling on (I need my)
Time keeps rolling on (I need my absolution)
Time keeps rolling on (I need my absolution)
Time keeps rolling on (I need my absolution)

Breathing out the cracks just to stay alive
Earthquake, body shake, joke is all on me
I remember when, I remember the time
Didn't have to take just to feel alive

Blame all your life on me
Blame all your life on me
I give it all for free
Blame all your life on me
On me, oh

Everything I wanted was in my hand
I gave it all up for a better man
Beat me down but on the ground I stand
Sitting in the back, baby how do you lie?
If I'm about to crack, keep the pedal in drive
All this time the joke was all on me

Blame all your life on me
Just blame all your life on me
I give it all for free
Blame all your life on me

Hear me with the wind again
Hear me with the wind I hope
I have lost a friend again
I have lost a friend I hope, how the story goes

Follow me down through the trees

Nights avoiding things unholy
Your hand slips across my skin
I go down on you so slowly
Don't confess none of your sins

These are a few of the things I find joy.
Bracelets of fingers since I was a boy.
Fly to the moon and I'll get there quite soon.

The hour's late and not a soul on the street,
As I stood alone there, at the edge of the night.

With all your wisdom, you had gone to bed early
I hesitated and just think what it cost me
Just like a victim in the sights it doesn't feel right

I had the backbone but then, I heard it cracking.
I faced the terror but I found myself lacking

Have passed through these arms on their way to the sea
They leave me tokens of love and affection

Living alone when there's no-one alive
Out in the night she swallows her pride

Down at the labour and there's nothing for me
He has a cabin, and he's safe at sea

The guilt is safely locked away

With lips drawn pale and thin
She offered up love like a sacrifice
And he was closing in.

With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming

You have technicians here, making noise.

The Primettes,"Well
Yes you did

You know I talk 
To my baby
I talk to her
Late last night

And she said
That she's still waiting
She said that if I hurry home
Everything gonna be alright
She said ""I don't mind waiting 'cause I never can get enough of your love""

So I went to the train station
And bought a one way ticket back home
You see, I realized what I was missing
Because I heard it, I heard it in the little
That little girl's voice

She said ""I don't mind waiting 'cause I never can get enough of your love""
Oh that's what she said
Never get enough of your love
She said I never, never, never, never get enough of your love

Now I don't know
If you've had this problem
But if you did
You better take my, take my advice
You better stay, stay at home
And never leave, never leave the little girl alone
Or you may never hear her say

""I don't mind waiting 'cause I never can get enough of your love""
She said ""I don't mind waiting 'cause I never can get enough of your love""

And you don't know how good it made me feel
When I heard her say never
Never get enough of my love
You don't know how good it made me feel
Oh no I never, never get enough
Never get enough
She said ""I never""",Never Get Enough of Your Love
The Primitives,"Now if you feel that you can't go on 
Because all of your hope is gone,
And your life is filled with much confusion 
Until happiness is just an illusion,
And your world around is crumblin' down;  
Darling, reach out (come on girl, reach on out for me) 
Reach out (reach out for me.)
I'll be there, with a love that  will shelter you.
I'll be there, with a love that will see you through.
I'll be there to always see you through.
 
When you feel lost and about to give up 
'Cause your best just ain't good enough
And you feel the world has grown cold, 
And you're drifting out all on your own, 
And you need a hand to hold:
Darling, reach out (come on girl, reach out for me) 
Reach out (reach out for me.)
I'll be there, to love and comfort you, 
And I'll be there, to cherish and care for you.
I'll be there to love and comfort you.
 
I can tell the way you hang your head,
You're without love and now you're afraid
And through your tears you look around, 
But there's no peace of mind to be found.
I know what you're thinkin', 
You're alone now, no love of your own, 
But darling, reach out (come on girl, reach out for me) 
Reach out (reach out for me.)
Just look over your shoulder
I'll be there, to give you all the love you need, 
And I'll be there, you can always depend on me.","Gira, Gira (Reach Out, I'll Be There)"
The Primitives,"Here you go
Way too fast
Don't slow down
Gonna crash
You should watch
Watch your step
Don't lookout
Gonna break your neck

So shut shut your mouth
'Cause I'm not listening anyhow
I've had enough enough of you
You know to last a lifetime through

So what do you want of me
Got no words of sympathy
And if I go around with you
You know that I'll get messed up too with you
With you

Nana nana na nana nana naaaaa
Nana nana na nana nana naaaaa

Here you go
Way too fast
Don't slowdown
Gonna crash
You don't know
What's been going down
You've been running
Allover town

So shut shut your mouth
'Cause I'm not listening anyhow
I've had enough enough of you
You know to last a lifetime through

So what do you want of me
Got no cure for misery
And if I go about with you
You know that I'll get messed up too with you
With you

The Primitives,"i just had the strangest dream
walking barefoot on the beach
sun filled valley and grass so green
sky and sea were out of reach
out of reach
out of reach
out of reach
out of reach

someone said we were all dead 
lifes worth nothing at all
that's not true
i'm here with you
and i've been here before

then i found a four leaf clover
in a field where I lay
fear of dying passed right over
hope they get it right someday

i want to stay, i want to say
i want to stay, i want to say

out of reach
out of reach
out of reach
out of reach

i just has the strangest dream
no more thunder only peace
sun filled valley and grass so green
sky and sea were out of reach
