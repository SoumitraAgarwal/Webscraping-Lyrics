Johnny Cash,"The chimes of time ring out the news, another day is through
Someone slipped and fell, was that someone you?
You may have longed for added strength, your courage to renew
Do not be discouraged, for I have news for you

It is no secret what God can do
What He's done for others, He'll do for you
With arms wide open, He'll pardon you
It is no secret what God can do

There is no night for in His light we'll never walk alone
Always feel at home, wherever you may roam
There is no power can conquer you while God is on your side
Just take Him at His promise, don't run away and hide

It is no secret what God can do
What He's done for others, He'll do for you
With arms wide open, He'll pardon you
It is no secret what God can do
It is no secret what God can do",It Is No Secret (What God Can Do) [#]
Johnny Cash,"Well, the bible tells us about a man
Who ruled Babylon and all its land. 
Around the city, he built a wall
And declared that Babylon would never fall. 
He had concubines and wives, 
He called his Babylon ""Paradise."" 
On his throne he drank and ate, 
But for Belshazzar it was gettin' late. 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand. 
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His houses were built upon the sand. 

Well, the people feasted and drank their wine
And praised the false gods of his time. 
All holy things they scorned and mocked, 
But suddenly all their mocking stopped. 
For on the wall, there appeared a hand, 
Nothin' else, there was no man. 
In blood the hand began to write, 
And Belshazzar couldn't hide his fright. 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand. 
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His houses were built upon the sand. 

Well, no one around could understand
What was written by the mystic hand. 
Belshazzar tried, but couldn't find
A man who could give him peace of mind. 
But Daniel, the prophet, a man of God, 
He saw the writing on the wall in blood. 
Belshazzar asked him what it said, 
And Daniel turned to the wall and read: 

""My friend, you're weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
Your kingdom is divided, it can't stand. 
You're weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
Your houses are built upon the sand.""",Belshazzar [DVD]
Johnny Cash,"I'm just an old chunk of coal
But I'm gonna be a diamond some day
I'm gonna grow and glow
'Til I'm so blue pure perfect
I'm gonna put a smile on everybody's face
But I'm gonna kneel and pray everyday
Lest I should become vain along the way
I'm just an old chunk of coal, now Lord
But I'm gonna be a diamond some day

I'm gonna learn the right way to talk
I'm gonna search and find a better way to walk
I'm gonna spit and polish my old rough-edged self
'Til I get rid of every single flaw
I'm gonna be the world's best friend
I'm gonna go around shaking everybody's hand
I'm gonna be the cotton-pickin' Rage of the Age
Yes I'm gonna be a diamond some day 

I said I'm just an old chunk of coal now Lord
But I'm gonna be a diamond some day",I'm Just an Old Chunk of Coal [DVD]
Johnny Cash,"Oh well, I'm tired and so weary
But I must go alone
Till the lord comes and calls, calls me away, oh yes
Well the morning's so bright
And the lamp is alight
And the night, night is as black as the sea, oh yes

There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
No trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me, for me

Well the bear will be gentle
And the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes
And the beasts from the wild
Shall be lit by a child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh yes

There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
No trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me, for me",Peace in the Valley [DVD]
Johnny Cash,"One day near Christmas when I was just a child
Mama called us together and mama tried to smile
She said you know the cotton crop hadn't been too good this year
There's not a lot of spending money and well at least we're all here

I hope you won't expect a lot of Christmas presents
Just be thankful that there is plenty to eat
That'll make things a little more pleasant
And us kids got to thinking how really blessed we were
At least we were all healthy and most of all we had her

Roy cut down a pine oak tree and we drug it home Jack and me
Daddy killed a squirrel and Louise made the bread
Reba decorated the tree with popcorn strings before we went to bed
Mama and daddy sacrificed because this Christmas was kind of lean
After all there was the babies Tom and Joanne
And babies need a few things

I whittled a whistle for my brother Jack
And though we disagreed now and then
When I gave Jack that whistle he knew I thought the world of him
Mama made the girl's dresses out of flower sacks
And when she ironed them down
You couldn't tell that they hadn't come from town

A sharecropper family across the road didn't have it as good as us
They didn't even have a light and it was way past dusk
And mama said, ""Well I bet they don't even have coal oil
Let alone apples and oranges and such""

Me and Jack took a jar of coal oil nd some hickernuts we'd found
We walked to the sharecropper's porch and set 'em down
A poor old ragged lady eased open the door
She picked up the coal oil and hickernuts and said
""I sure do thank you"" and quickly closed the door

We started back home me and Jack
And about halfway we stopped looked back
And in the sharecropper's window at last was a light
So for one of the neighbors and for us it was a good Christmas night

Christmas came and Christmas went
Christmas that year was heaven sent
And my daddy put on his rubber boots
And paced the floor waiting for the thaw
Back home in Dyess Arkansas",Christmas as I Knew It [DVD]
Johnny Cash,"I hear the train a comin'
It's rollin' 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine
Since, I don't know when

I'm stuck in Folsom Prison
And time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a-rollin'
On down to San Antone

When I was just a baby
My Mama told me, ""Son
Always be a good boy
Don't ever play with guns""

But I shot a man in Reno
Just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin'
I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eatin'
From a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee
And smokin' big cigars

Well, I know I had it comin'
I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me

Well, if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it all a little
Farther down the line

Far from Folsom Prison
That's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle
Blow my blues away",Folsom Prison Blues [Mono Version]
Johnny Cash,"So blue Lonesome too But still true
Rosie haunts me Makes me think of you
You're the one rose that's left in my heart, 
Dear I love you, adore you, I do
Each night in dreamland we wander along
Telling love stories anew
When from a blue sky a black cloud came rolling
Breaking my heart in two
Oh we ought not to part
I have said from the start
You're the one rose that's left in my heart

Oh we ought not to part
I have said from the start
You're the one rose that's left in my heart",The One Rose (That's Left in My Heart) [Mono Version]
Johnny Cash,"Well, now I looked over Jordan and what did I see
Comin' for to carry me home
There was a band of angels a comin' after me
Comin' for to carry me home

Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home

Well, I'm sometimes up and I'm sometimes down
Comin' for to carry me home
But I know my soul is heavenly bound
Comin' for to carry me home

Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home

Well, now if you get there before I do
Comin' for to carry me home
Tell all of my friends that I'm a comin' too
Comin' for to carry me home

Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Well, now they're comin' for to carry me home","Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"
Johnny Cash,"I keep a close watch on this heart of mine. 
I keep my eyes wide open all the time. 
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds. 
Because you're mine, I walk the line.

I find it very, very easy to be true. 
I find myself alone when each day is through. 
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you. 
Because you're mine, I walk the line.

As sure as night is dark and day is light. 
I keep you on my mind both day and night. 
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line.

You've got a way to keep me on your side. 
You give me cause for love that I can't hide. 
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide. 
Because you're mine, I walk the line.",Walk the Line [Mono Version]
Johnny Cash,"I mushed from Port Barrol through a blizzard of snow
Been out prospecting for two years or so
Pulled into Fairbanks, the city was a boon
So I took a little stroll to the Red Dog Saloon

When I walked in the door, the music was clear
Prettiest voice I had heard in two years
The song she kept singing would make a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska, it's forty below

It was red headed Louie that was singing so sweet
I reached down and took the snow packs off of my feet
I reached for the gal that was singing the tune
We did the Eskimo hop all around the saloon

Where the caribou crawl and the grizzly bear hug
We did our dance on a Kodiak rug
The song she kept singing would make a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska, it's forty below

Well, I was as innocent as I could be
I didn't know that Louie was big Ed's wife to be
He took out his knife and he gave it a throw
When it's springtime in Alaska, I'll be six feet below",When It's Springtime in Alaska (It's Forty Below) [Mono Version]
Johnny Cash,"I remember when I was a lad
Times were hard and things were bad
But there's a silver linin' behind ev'ry cloud
Just four people that 's all we were
Tryin' to make a livin' out of black-land dirt
But we'd get together in a family circle singin' loud

Daddy sang bass (mama sang tenor)
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singin' seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm gonna join the family circle at the throne

Though the circle won't be broken
By and by, Lord, by and by
Daddy sang bass (mama sang tenor)
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Now I remember after work mama would call in all of us
You could hear us singin' for a country mile
Now little brother has done gone on
But I'll rejoin him in a song
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while

Johnny Cash,"The warden led a prisoner down the hallway to his doom
And I stood up to say goodbye like all the rest
And I heard him tell the warden just before he reached my cell
""Let my guitar friend do my request""

Let him sing me back home with a song I
And make my old memories come alive
And take me away and turn back the years
Sing me back home before I die

I recall last Sunday morning a choir from off the streets
Came in to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers, ""There's a song my mama sang
Could I hear it once before you move along?""

Let him sing me back home, with the song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing me back home before I die

Johnny Cash,"I once held her in my arms
She said she would always stay
But I was cruel
I treated her like a fool
I threw it all away

Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
And rivers that ran through every day
I must have been mad
I never knew what I had
Until I threw it all away

Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round
Love and only love, it can't be denied
No matter what you think about it
You just won't be able to do without it
Take a tip from one who's tried

So if you find someone that gives you all of her love
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
For one thing that's certain
You will surely be a-hurtin'
If you throw it all away
If you throw it all away",I Threw It All Away
Johnny Cash,"She was called a scarlet woman by the people
Who would go to church but left me in the street
With no parents of my own,I never had a home
And an eighteen year old boy has got to eat
           
She found me outside one Sunday morning
Taking money from a man I didn't know
She took me in and wiped away my childhood
A woman of the streets this Lady Rose
           
[Chorus]
This bed of roses that I lay on
Where I was taught to be a man
This bed of roses where I'm living
Is the only kind of love I understand
           
She was a handsome woman just thirty-four
Who was spoken to in town by very few
She managed a late evening business
Like most of the town wished they could do
           
And I learned all the things that a man should know
From a woman not approved of I suppose
But she died knowing that I really loved her
Off life's bramble bush,I picked a rose",Bed of Roses [DVD]
Johnny Cash,"Hey little girl, with tears in your eyes
Don't waste your time now, askin' me why
I don't know, I know I'll just be movin' along
You'd say that home is where my love is at
I say that home is where I hang my hat
The time has come to sing a travelin' song

You own a house and a lot of close friends
I love the feel of my back to the wind
The two won't match, you know the caves so wild would be wrong
You want your friends and love, a child and a home
You can't buy love on a twenty year loan
The time has come to sing a travelin' song

Someday where we sat on that old porch swing
A tamer man might offer you a ring
A man that wants his friends and neighbors, a child and a home
Don't waste your tears on dreams that never can be
What's right for others is not right for me
The time has come to sing a travelin' song

The time has come to sing a travelin' song

I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right

I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
But goodbye's too good a word, gal

Johnny Cash,"Wings in the morning and license to fly
Straight to the portals of never more die
Never more pain in them old aching bones
Wings in the morning to carry us home

My grandfather lived by the book all his life
On rich bottom land with twelve kids and a wife
He never saw TV, nor rode a jet plane
But he knew that heaven was holding his claim

The salt of the earth, yet with faith in the Lord
They all got together in that one accord
And what could be greater than God's guarantee
That we can have heaven for eternity?

Rocks in the road and we stumble and fall
Lights getting low, so we don't see at all
But I promise you, on that getting up day
Wings in the morning, we'll fly away

Johnny Cash,"I studied at the feet of a master
Gamaliel we called him, the beauty of the law
I was born of the Tribe of Benjamin, I was a Pharisee
And I could quote from memory the Holy Torah

That day that the Nazarene was brought to trial
It was on a Sabbath eve, there was a earthquake when He died
Just another passing preacher who came up from Galilee
Blaspheming trouble-maker, we let Him be crucified

Then I thought that I would hear no more about him
But his friends found his tomb empty
Claimed that he rose from the dead
Then they said he walked among them
With the nail wounds in his hands
That King upon a donkey with a thorn crown on his head

His followers kept growing in great number
And the one that they call Caiaphas mocked us in the judgment hall
And with the Greek name Stephen, we knew the gentiles had come in
I cast my vote against him, he was stoned I saw him fall

Then the friends of the Nazarene became united
And I became enraged then led a slaughter zealously
I found their secret places, they were beaten, they were chained
But some of them were scattered, justified in fearing me

Then the Man in White, appeared to me
In such a blinding light it struck me down
With it's brilliance, took away my sight, then the Man in White
In gentle loving tone spoke to me
And I was blinded so that I might see, the Man in White

But like the wind that blows the scattered sea
From Alexandria to Antioch their congregation grew
I went to the high priest for letters of permission
To go to other cities, to see my mission through

Six days on the hot road to the masters
And just outside the city in the middle of the day
A great unearthly light struck and overpowered me
Prostrate on the hot road, I was blinded were I laid

Then I thought I heard the rushing of great water
And a multitude of angels singing sweet and heavenly
And through the sound of wind, came a voice so soft and kind
Meant for only me to hear, ""Saul, why do you persecute me?""

As I lay there on the ground, in my blindness
He asked me once again, and suddenly the voice I knew
So finally I managed, a trembling response
Who are you Lord? I asked him, but I already knew

I am Jesus of Nazareth the voice answered
Arise go to Damascus on the street called Straight will be
A place where you will wait for my servant Ananias
He will open up your eyes, you'll be a witness unto me

So now I live to serve my master
As zealous in his service as I once was as his foe
And keeping his commandments given on Damascus road
I go to all the world, and I let the whole world know

Then the Man in White, appeared to me
In such a blinding light it struck me down
With it's brilliance, took away my sight, then the Man in White
In gentle loving tone spoke to me
And I was blinded so that I might see, the Man in White
And I was blinded so that I might see, the Man in White

Johnny Cash,"Six foot six he stood on the ground
He weighed two hundred and thirty-five pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down
To his knees by love

He was the kind of man that would gamble on luck
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup
Because of love

You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
But like the wind it covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man
This thing called love
It can lift you up never let you down
Take your world and turn it around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found
That's stronger than love

Most men are like me, they struggle and doubt
They trouble their minds day in and day out
Too busy with livin' to worry about
A little word like love

But when I see a mother's tenderness
As she holds her young close to her breast
Then I think god that the world's been blessed
With a thing called love

You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
But like the wind it covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man
This thing called love
It can lift you up never let you down
Take your world and turn it around

That an Old Account was standin' for sins yet unforgiven

His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and he sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change

Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear

Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams

And so was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston

With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line",I Walk the Line [From the Johnny Cash TV Show]

Johnny Cash,"(Praises sing to Christ the King and peace to men on earth) 
On Christmas Eve I dreamed I traveled all around the earth 
And in my dream I saw and heard the ways the different people hail the king 
Whose star shone in the east and what a dream it was 
In London Town I walked around Piccadilly Circus 
A mass of people movin' here and there I wandered where 
On every face at every place was hurry up I'm late 
But a kind old man at a chestnut stand said merry Christmas mate 
And I felt the Christmas spirit 

In a little town nestled down in Bavaria Germany 
I walked along to see what the feeling there would be 
And here again was the busy din the rushin' the yellin' 
But some kind boy said Frohliche Weihnachten 
Not undesratnding the words but gettin' the buyin' and sellin' 
I felt the Christmas spirit 

In Bethlehem I heard a hymn some distant choir sang 
And with other tourists I walked along to a church as its bells rang 
Then I heard someone tell someone there's where Christ was born 
I wonder if he looked like our baby looked on that first morn 
And then I really felt the Christmas spirit 
From a businessman in the Holy Land as a sidewalk souvenirshop 
I bought a little Bible since I'd hardly stopped 
And it was in Paris France somehow by chance that I took the Bible out 
And as I flipped the pages I saw these words and I knew what it was all about 
For I read fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy 
Which shall be to all people 
For unto you he was born this day in the City of David a Saviour 
Which is Christ the Lord 

Then I took the little Holy Book held it close and tight 
I closed my eyes and visualized the glory of that night 
So suddenly it came to me for when I awoke on Christmas Day 
I felt the Christmas spirit down deep inside to stay 
(O little town of Bethlehem how still we see Thee lie 
Above Thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by 
Yet in Thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light 
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in Thee tonight)",The Christmas Spirit [DVD]
Johnny Cash,"I heard the bells on Christmas Day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

I thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along unbroken song
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth I said
For hate is strong that mocks the song
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor doubt He sleeps
The wrong shall fail the right prevail
With peace on earth goodwill to men

Till ringin' singin' on its way
The world revolve from night to day
A voice a chime a chance so blind
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor doubt He sleeps
The wrong shall fail the right prevail
With peace on earth goodwill to men",I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day [DVD]
Johnny Cash,"Goodbye little darlin', we're parted
Parting don't always mean goodbye
Although we had to part you're always in my heart

Miss you like the stars would miss the sky
I hate to see you go, I'm gonna miss you

Will you dream a dream of me wherever you may be

Johnny Cash,"Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die

I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl
Then I heard my dream was back downstream Cavortin' in Davenport
And I followed you, Big River, when you called

Then you took me to St. Louis later on down the river
A freighter said she's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone
I found her trail in Memphis but she just walked up the block
Raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone

Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans
Go on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the gulf

Johnny Cash,"I hear the train a comin', it's rollin' 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck at Folsom Prison and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby, my mama told me, ""Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns""
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folk eatin' in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smokin' big cigars
But I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free
But those people keep a movin', and that's what tortures me

Well, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
Bet I'd move on over a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away",Folsom Prison Blues [Pete Rock Remix]

Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
Yes a jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine 
It'll shake all the troubles from your worried mind,
Get rhythm when you get the blues.

Little shoeshine boy never get slow down
But he's gt the dirtiest job in town
Bendin' low at the peoples' feet
On the windy corner of the dirty street
Well, I asked him while he shined my shoes
How'd he keep from gettin' the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said.

Get rhythm when you get the blues
Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
It only costs a dime, just a nickel a shoe
Does a million dollars worth of good for you
Get rhythm when you get thee blues.

Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy
And I thought I was gonna jump for joy
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
I said you're a mighty little boy to be-a workin' that way
He said I like it with a big wide grin
Kept on a poppin' and he said again

Get rhythm when you get the blues

Get taps on your toes and get gone

Down the street that losers use
If you can wade in through the teardrops

Keeps time with the drag of my shoes
The sun never shines through this window of mine
It's dark at the Home of the Blues

Mem'ries so sweet that I cry
Dreams that I've had left me feeling so bad

And it seems there's no good way to choose
Come along with me, misery loves company

Each star's a pool of water, cool water 
But with the dawn I'll wake and yawn 
And carry on to water, cool, clear, water  
The shadows sway and seem to say 

Tonight we pray for water, cool, water 
And way up there He'll hear our prayer 
And show us where there's water, cool, clear, water

Who ruled Babylon and all its land. 
Around the city, he built a wall
And declared that Babylon would never fall. 
He had concubines and wives, 
He called his Babylon ""Paradise."" 
On his throne he drank and ate, 
But for Belshazzar it was gettin' late. 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand. 
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His houses were built upon the sand. 

Well, the people feasted and drank their wine
And praised the false gods of his time. 
All holy things they scorned and mocked, 
But suddenly all their mocking stopped. 
For on the wall, there appeared a hand, 
Nothin' else, there was no man. 
In blood the hand began to write, 
And Belshazzar couldn't hide his fright. 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting,

Johnny Cash,"Well, you wonder why I always dress in black,
Why you never see bright colors on my back,
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone.
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on.

I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down,
Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town,
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime,
But is there because he's a victim of the times.

I wear the black for those who never read,
Or listened to the words that Jesus said,
About the road to happiness through love and charity,
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me.

Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose,
In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes,
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back,
Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black.

I wear it for the sick and lonely old,
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold,
I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been,
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men.

And, I wear it for the thousands who have died,
Believen' that the Lord was on their side,
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died,
Believen' that we all were on their side.

Well, there's things that never will be right I know,
And things need changin' everywhere you go,
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right,
You'll never see me wear a suit of white.

And tell the world that everything's OK,

Heading south from Caroline
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

Got in trouble, had to roam
Left my gal an' left my home
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

Just a kid, acting smart
I went and broke my darling's heart
I guess I was too young to know

They took me off the Georgia Main
Locked me to a ball and chain
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

All alone, I bear the shame
I'm a number, not a name
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

All I do is sit an' cry
When the evening train goes by
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

I'll be locked here in this cell
'Till my body's just a shell
An' my hair turns whiter than snow

I'll never see that gal of mine

But still true
Rosie haunts me
Makes me think of you

Dear, I love you
Adore you, I do

Telling love stories anew
When from a blue sky a black cloud came rolling
Breaking my heart in two

Oh, we ought not to part
I have said from the start
You're the one rose
That's left in my heart

Oh, we ought not to part
I have said from the start
You're the one rose

Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues

Get rhythm when you get the blues

Little shoeshine boy never gets low down
But he's got the dirtiest job in town
Bendin' low at the peoples' feet
On the windy corner of the dirty street

How'd he keep from gettin' the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said

Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
It only costs a dime, just a nickel a shoe
Does a million dollars worth of good for you
Get rhythm when you get the blues

And I thought I was gonna jump for joy
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight

Johnny Cash,"An old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A-plowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yippie yi ooh
Yippie yi yay
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on hear their cry

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the devil's herd, across these endless skies

Johnny Cash,"Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head.

Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico.

Laid in the hot joint takin' the pill
In walked a sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down.

I said yes sir my name is Willie Lee
If you've got a warrant just read it to me
Shot her down cause she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more.

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
I had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in the county jail.

Got up next morning about a half past nine
I spied a sheriff comin' down the line
Coughed and coughed as he cleared his throat
He said come on you dirty hack into that district court

Into the court room my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about.

In about five minutes in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
I hollered Lordy Lordy have mercy on me

The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety nine years in the Folsom pen
Ninety nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot my woman down
Come on you gotta listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be",Cocaine Blues [#]

Johnny Cash,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head, that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad,
So I had one more for dessert.
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt.
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day.

I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and the songs I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playin' with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's fryin' chicken
And it took me back to somethin'
That I'd lost somewhere, somehow along the way.

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone.
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of a sleepin' city sidewalk
And Sunday mornin' comin' down.

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughin' little girl who he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singin'
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed thru the canyon 
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday.

Johnny Cash,"In a little cabaret in a South Texas border town,
Sat a boy and his guitar, and the people came from miles around.
And all the girls from there to Austin,
Were slipping away from home and putting jewelery in hock.
To take the trip, to go and listen,
To the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

And he would play,

Well, he couldn't ride or wrangle, and he never cared to make a dime.
But give him his guitar, and he'd be happy all the time.
And all the girls from nine to ninety,
Were snapping fingers, tapping toes, and begging him: ""Don't stop.""
And hypnotized and fascinated,
By the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

And he would play,

Then one day he was gone, and no one ever saw him 'round,
He'd vanished like the breeze, they forgot him in the little town.
But all the girls still dreamed about him.
And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked.
And then one day on the Hit Parade,
Was a little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

I dig that ditch

I gat a gal back home that's sweet and kind and she's been waitin' a long long time 
I just told her to forget my name I won't ever live down to shame

Johnny Cash,"I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, 
I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, 
I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, 
I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, 
I walk the line",I Walk the Line [Nezlobim] [Live]
Johnny Cash,"I was on my way to you and I was worried
I was all torn up and nervous 'cause I knew that you'd be gone
I knocked and crossed my fingers while I waited
And I couldn't hold the teardrops when I walked away alone

It's all over, it's all over, my heart echoed (it's all over)
Every minute that you cry for her is wasted don't you know
It's all over, it's all over, so forget her (it's all over)
Stop your cryin' turn around and let her go

I was runnin' 'round in circles like a baby
I was in a daze because I loved you so, I couldn't see
I was broken in a million little pieces
When I saw enough to realize, you didn't care for me

It's all over, it's all over, my heart echoed, it's all over
Every minute that you cry for her is wasted don't you know
It's all over, it's all over, so forget her (it's all over)
Stop your cryin' turn around and let her go",It's All Over
Johnny Cash,"I do my best to hide this lowdown feelin' 
I try to make believe there's nothing wrong
But they're always asking me about you darling
And it hurts me so to tell 'em that you're gone
If they ask me I guess I'd be denyin' 
That I've been unhappy all alone
But if they heard my heart they'd hear it cryin'
Where's my darling, when's she coming home

I ask myself a million times what's right for me to do
To try to lose my blues alone or hang around for you
But I make it pretty good until that moon comes shining through
And then I get so doggone lonesome

Time stands still when you're a waitin' 
Sometimes I think my heart is stoppin' too
One lonely hour seems forever 
Sixty minutes more to wait for you
But I guess I'll keep waitin' 'til you're with me
'Cause I believe that loving you is right
But I don't care if the sun don't rise tomorrow 
If I can't have you with me tonight

Well I know I'll keep on loving you 
'Cause true love can't be killed
I ought to get you off of my mind 
But I guess I never will
I could have a dozen others 
But I know I'd love you still
'Cause I get so doggone lonesome",So Doggone Lomesome
Johnny Cash,"Come out of the darkness
Don't hide in the night
Come out in the sunshine
And we'll be alright

Life's too long to worry
And it's too short to cry
And it's too deep to measure
And it's too stories wide

There's your side and my side
Which side do you need?
Both sides make you lonely
And make your heart bleed

With an engineer that's brave
We must make the run successful
From the cradle to the grave

Heed the curves and watch the tunnels
Never falter, never fail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail

Blessed Savior, Thou will guide us
Till we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us
In that train forevermore

Kind of rubbed me the wrong way

When they crowned your sister County Queen

On family reunion day
Didn't we all look funny

Your brother drank more than enough
Your mom wore penny loafers
With runners in her hose

Far into September
But I had no one to give the flowers to
I needed the celebration
of September coronation
And I admitted to myself I needed you

I've watched the gentle winds change
The colored shades of meadows
I've seen the dillon flowers
That had no name
But I let my vase stay empty
Like my old and empty heart
Picking flowers for yourself is not the same

Don't you think its come our time to be together
Lets gather up our scattered words of love
And make them rhyme

Lets go pick some flowers and fill our empty vases

Don't you think its come our time?

Would you take the small bouquet that leaves a fragrance on my fingers
And the feeling that your love is close at hand

Thank you for the flowers
Now lets walk through the meadows
To the road where our divines caress the sand

Don't you think its come our time to be together
Lets gather up our scattered words of love
And make them rhyme

Lets go pick some flowers now and fill our empty vases

I cried out for help and I felt a warm comforter there

I came to believe that I needed help to get by
In childlike faith I gave in and gave him a try
And I came to believe in a power much higher than I

Nothing worked out when I handled it all on my own
And each time I failed it made me feel twice as alone
Then I cried, ""Lord there must be a sure and easier way
For it just cannot be that a man should lose hope every day.""

She waved her fans and headed for her car

She said, you're kind of cute fellar, wanna mess around?
When we got to my room just the people lied
I said sure wish I could've heard you sing tonight

That he lets the old man run out in the street

And a dog that won't even bark at a firefly

And there's a tire that swings in the air
Ten feet or more
There's a church I can't seem to find
On Sunday mornin'
But I sure found the place that I belong in

And big green beans
Spend the summertime naturally high
By chopping wood, the next one or five
Saving our money for the county fair

We got forty acres of corn in the ground

Proud as we can be

I know you love that sweet little gal of mine
You and her could talk about babies
Make some home made apple pie
While me and dad could take a walk

Gently break the news that you don't love me
And give my best regards to your good old dad

I always liked your family
We got along just splendidly
Though your brother
Kind of rubbed me the wrong way
I remember that your eyes turned green
When they crowned your sister County Queen
Though she couldn't hold a candle
To your beauty any day

When you get a chance
Would you please call your mother
And thank her for the good years that we had?
Gently break the news that you don't love me
And give my best regards to your good old dad

Back when we could laugh and play
On family reunion day
Didn't we all look funny
In our 1950s clothes?
Your daddy wore that greasy stuff
Your brother drank more than enough
Your mom wore penny loafers
With runners in her hose

When you get a chance
Would you please call your mother
And thank her for the good years that we had?
O gently break the news that you don't love me
And give my best regards to your good old dad.

Johnny Cash,"I have picked wild roses
Far into september
But I had no one to give the flowers to
I needed a celebration
A September coronation
And I admitted to myself I needed you

I've watched the gentle winds change
The colors shades of meadows
Ive seen the dew on flowers that had no name
But I let my vase stay empty like my lonely empty heart
Picking flowers for yourself is not the same

Don't you think its come our time to be together
Lets gather up our scattered words of love and make them rhyme
Let's go pick some flowers and fill our empty vases
Don't you think its come out time

Would you take this small bouquet that leaves a fragrance on my fingers
And a feeling that your love is close at hand
Thank you for the flowers, now lets walk through the meadows
Through the brook where our demands caress the sand",Don't You Think It's Come Our Time
Johnny Cash,"She gave me my walking papers
And ran off with someone new
'Cause he bought her things
My wages couldn't buy
So I turned to ups and downers
And everything between
Still I can't get her good lovin'
Off my mind

Well today I bought a Cadillac
The kind she's always wanted
I called and asked her
If she'd like to ride
She said this is our last date
I said that's alright with me
Cause tonight I'm driving her
Out of my mind

Yeah I'll take her on a scenic cruise
Right off of Lookout Mountain
'Cause she said I never took her out
When she was mine
She'll see all seven states
As we drive to the pearly gates
Tonight when I drive her
Out of my mind

All the papers will read ""Lovers leap
Again off Lookout Mountain""
'Cause I wrote a note
That called it suicide
But my epitaph will say
""he killed his pain yesterday
When he finally drove that woman
Off his mind""

Well now here she comes to greet me
Dressed to kill and so am I
Hope she asks me if this
Cadillac will fly
And I know that I'll die laughin'
When I show her that it will
When I drive that woman
Right out of my mind

Hell I'll take her on a scenic cruise
Right off of Lookout Mountain
'Cause she said I never took her out

She'll see all seven states

Tonight when I drive her

They'll say Johnny Cash was quite a smash
Down here in Chatanooga
Last night when he drove her
Out of his mind

Yeah that Cadillac dealer's in for a big surprise too
99 dollars down, 99 dollars a month
Yeah it's gonna be just gorgeous

That big loud whistle as it blew and blew
Said hello to the southland, we're comin' to you
And when we're movin' on, oh hear my song
You had the laugh on me, so I'm settin' you free
So keep movin' on

'Cause I got a pretty mama in Tennessee
Keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal, let this rattler roll
And keep movin' on

Mister Engineer, take that throttle in hand
This rattler's the fastest in the southern land
Keep movin' me on, keeps rollin' on
You gonna ease my mind and put me there on time
Keep rollin' on

I've warned you baby, from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
So I'm movin' on, I'm rollin' on
You have broken your vow and it's all over now
So I'm movin' on

You've switched your engine now I ain't got time
For a triflin' woman on my main line
So I'm movin' on, you done your daddy wrong
I've warned you twice, you can settle the price
'Cause I'm movin' on

You're gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say

Johnny Cash,"It's midnight at a liquor store in Texas
Closing time another day is done
When a boy walked in the door and points a pistol
He can't find a job, but Lord, he's found a gun

He pulls it off with no trace of confrontation
Then he lets the old man run out in the street
Even though he knows they'll come with guns a blazing
Already he can feel a great relief

Oh, how many travelers get weary
Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to start all over
And fly like eagles out among the stars?

He pictures the arrival of the cruisers
Sees that old familiar anger in their eyes
He knows that when they're shooting at this loser
They'll be aiming at the demons in their lives

Oh, how many travelers get weary
Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to start all over
And fly like eagles out among the stars?

The evening news carries all the details
He dies in every living room in town
And in his own a bottle's thrown in anger
And his father cries, he'll never live this down

Oh, how many travelers get weary

Johnny Cash,"I saw her through the window today
She was sittin' in the Silver Spoon cafe
I started to keep going
But something made me stop
She used to love me a lot

She looked lonely and I knew the cure
Old memories would win her heart for sure
I thought I'd walk on in
And I give it my best shot
She used to love me a lot

I sat down beside her and she smiled
She said where have you been it's been awhile
She was glad to see me
I could almost read her thoughts
She used to love me a lot

She used to love me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe I said good-bye
It would only take a minute to turn back the clock
She used to love me a lot

I remember how good it was back then
And I said it's not to late to start again
We could spend a night together
Take up where we left off
She used to love me a lot

But I panicked as she turned to walk away
As she went out the door I heard her say
Yes I'm in need of something
But it's something you ain't got
But I used to love you a lot

I thought she loved me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe she said good-bye

And a creek that rolls near by
And a dog won't even bark at a firefly

Our clothes lines hang just outside our back door
And theres a tire that swings in the air 10 feet or more
Theres a church I can't seem to find on Sunday morning
But I sure found the place I belong in

And we wear blue jeans and big green things
Spend the summer time naturally high
By, chopping wood for next winters fire

It was there an old cow puncher, stepped up and said to me
How do you do young fellow and how would you like to go
And spend a pleasant summer, out in New Mexico

I'll furnish you good wages, your transportation too
If you will but go with me, one summer season through
But if you should get homesick and back to Griffin go
Then I'll furnish you no horses from the hills of Mexico

We left the town of Griffin in the merry month of May
When all the world was lovely and everything was gay
With saddles on our horses, marching over we did go
Until we reached the logging out in New Mexico

It was there our pleasures ended and our troubles they began
The first hail storm fell on us, those cattle how they ran
Through all the thorns and thistles, us cowboys had to go
While the Indians watched upon us, out in New Mexico

Well, when the drive was over, the riders would not pay
To all you happy people, this much I have to say
Go back to your friends and loved ones, tell others not to go
To the God forsaken country, they call New Mexico",New Mexico [Un-Overdubbed Take 2]

I saw him run into the night

And on his face, more than a trace
Of wild fear in the eye
He was haunted by a tragic dream
Of people in death machines
And he did not know which side he was on
And he hated being in between oh

Bombs away, bombs away
Sign of the times
Watch where you're going
What will you do
See you if I free you
Into the night
Feel the fear
Do you know your left from your right?

He's tired of the lies
He's tired of the truth
They never give him what they say
He's tired of the fight
He's tired of the truce
The blackmail of judgement day
He believes in a magic wave
That rolls on the sea of time
That can touch every single human soul
If they could recognize it when it came Too late

Bombs away, bombs away

See you if I free you

It's an illusion!

Once again my wings on fire
Flapping round your deadly flames
Walking on the old high wire
Trying to keep myself away
You come walking down your marble stairs
Throwing back your yellow hair
And I want you and I need you
But every time you let me near
You leave me feeling such sweet despair
Going to keep away, keep away

It's an illusion
To think I can keep away from you
It's an illusion
Like eskimoes in Mogadishu
It's an illusion
This state of independence I'm in
It's an illusion
Like polar bears in Berlin

When I feel happy, you feel deep
You always go out when I want to sleep
Fire, water, sun and rain
War and peace and night and day
Who can understand
Love's magic incompatibilities?
Going to keep away, keep away

It's an illusion
It's just a cheap masquerade
It's an illusion
Hiding this love I can't evade
It's an illusion
Can't you see through the camouflage?
It's an illusion
Without you life is a mirage

I'm a foot without a shoe, I'm the fuzz without a clue
I'm a ship without a crew, I'm lost without you
One and one that can't make two, carrots looking for some stew
A lawyer with no one to sue, I'm lost without you
I'm the sky that's lost it's blue, I'm the beer that just won't brew
I'm a stamp that has no glue, I'm lost without you
A hound with no fox to pursue, I'm a cat that's lost it's mew

Dream if you will but remember there are iron laws
However much you seek to solve this mystery

They tried to fly over the palisades

Standing at the gates
This is Jericho
And the walls reach up to the stars
And outside we were singing psalms
Such a strange, strange place
For we are the prisoners
Of the prisoners we have taken
And the prophets' dreams are now forsaken

Sing me the songs of a world that I once knew
Recall the legends once so proud and true
My people used to live here not so long ago
But they fled into the night and I was left alone
I guard these walls for you and me
Dream on, sail on my memory

They came without any warning
No time to hide or fight
They came like bees aswarming
The questions start to fly
Will he break or will he defy?
Can he withstand the worst that is to come?
A child in a man's clothing
Resisting the fascist' ploy
The underground puts iron in the heart of any boy
Swimming in a sea of pain, he knows this is the end
He hears himself whisper the name of his best friend

I never betrayed you, and I never betrayed the revolution
I just didn't want to die alone, I needed you to see me home
And if I could save you, and if I could find a solution
I would die a thousand times, to get you out of here

Sharing the same cold cell
Betrayer and betrayed
An island with two frightened castaways
Not a word is spoken,
How can he explain?
Through swollen eyes they watch the dawn's first rays
It's all over now
They stand backs to the wall
Waiting for the fascist's sword to fall
In the desperation of a young life about to end
He turns before the bullet
And forgives a friend

I never betrayed you, and I never betrayed the revolution
I just didn't want to die alone, I needed you to see me home
And if I could save you, and if I could find a solution
I would die a thousand times, to get you out of here",Warsaw 1943

Faces melting in the african rain
So many seasons of silent war
So many drowned before they reached the shore
Nothing is clear to me any more in this sad and strange landscape
I've got no defense, I've got no attack
I can't leave, I can't stay and I've got no way back
Hard to deal with the way things have been
I can't lie but the truth is so extreme

Woman be my country, 'till my country can be mine
Hide me deep inside your borders in these dark and troubled times
Remember me my innocence before I drowned in the sea of lies
Woman be my country, 'till my country can be mine

Too many seasons of quiet rage
Too many young people just wasted away
Too many futures hanging in the balance
Too much owing nothing left to pay
A lonely flag flutters in the breeze
For the hardened hearts who still want to believe
Am I the witness or am I the crime
A victim of history or just a sign of the times
Across my heart questions and shadows still fly
But in the dead of the night I know where the answer lies

Woman be my country, 'till my country can be mine
I have no flag, I sing no anthem, I no longer carry an armalite
Bathe me in you sweet rivers, anoint me with your touch and your smile
To your colours I give my allegiance, I lay it on the line

Johnny Clegg,"Oh no, you've gone again
I feel like Daniel in the lion's den
Stone cold in the afternoon
So alone in the empty room
They say that four walls do not a prison make
I'm trying to find a way out but there seems no escape
When I feel the hidden power that lies inside your sound
Like the ghost inside the atom that spins it round and round
There's magic in some words, some things you can't explain
That conjures up that feeling of the sun inside the rain

[Chorus]
When the wind is blowing like a lonesome train
I reach out and touch you and I call your name
When the night is lonely and I fear the coming day
I reach out and touch you
And I call your name -- ngibiza igama lakho

Oh no, don't let the sun go down
I'm so low, I feel underground
There's no easy road and no easy way
To say the things I have to say
'Cause I know that time is a distance and distance is a space
I've come so far to find you, it's you I can't replace
When I feel the hidden power that lies inside your sound
Like the ghost inside the atom that spins it round and round
There's magic in some words some things you can't explain
That conjures up that feeling of the sun inside the rain

[Chorus]",I Call Your Name
Johnny Clegg,"Something broke the place where the rain is bornb
Something stole the promise from the light of dawn
People, people were everywhere struggling to get their share
Honest cruelty in the eyes of the innocent
Squeezing one more harvest from this tired earth
They call to you, but the wind just blows away their words
Didn't believe in miracles, didn't believe you'd come
Didn't see any reason to carry on

Chorus:
But in my african dream, you touched my face
Raised up my children and gave them grace
In my african dream you wiped away my tears
And whispered the promise of a thousand years

Children with eyes like souls ready to fly
Looking at me -- for some kind of sacred sign
Who will teach the young, the names of the ancient ones
Who will tell them from whence they come
I have no answer, don't even have a prayer
All I can do is close my eyes and hope that you will be thre

In my african dream you blessed the rain
Let me stand proud, eased the pain,
You raised me up,
Gave me love, filled my cup.

Old man sits in the shade of the thorn treee
He says ""these thorns are all that are true
Life is suffering, suffering is life,
Be happy with the small things that come to you
They will come to you, come to you.""

Johnny Clegg,"Shine a light, shine a light

Oh you've got to careful in this world a little sister said to me
Beware of the silver tongue which hides a gun and a tyranny
It will speak in words of water
It will drown you in its lies

Ad learn to swim against the tide

Some of de man he give a cry
Some of de man he gonna live through the season
Some of de man he gonna die

I drop to the ground
And hope for the best
I'm going through the eye

Oh it's such a sad feeling to see the swallows in the sky
It's like you leaving me behind without saying goodbye
I've got to be like a bird in winter
I've got to learn how to fly
And if you ever leave
I'll also take to the sky

Someone's on the run

To put silence stained by crimes to flight

To see life burning with a mission
To break the empty circle of living and dying

On the roof top of my heart
There's a movement in the whispering deep
Before the new dream starts
I see your eyes shining like a neon light .
Smiling in the dark - What made you so strong ?
-What made you so strong ?
I've seen you dealing in the market place
Buying political regrets
And you've been walking on the water again
But your feet never ever get wet
But you just say...

Chorus: Afrika kukhala abangcwele
(Africa your innocent weep)
I light a candle for the innocent ones
I light a candle for our love
Say a prayer for peace on earth
For the daughters and the sons

And your life is like a cheap street fight
And you're laughing in the dark - What
Made you so strong ? (repeat)
I've been waiting all my life for this
To see how the deal gees down -
There's an AK 47 on the dashboard
And mercy's left this town, and you say...

Chorus: Afrika kukhala abangcwele !
(Africa your innocent weep...
That's the way
It is.. .What makes you so strong ?

Kwela man, singing under the street light
A cheap guitar, he gave his sorrow a smile
And he sowed his songs in the alley ways mile upon mile

Living low with the Pennywhistle, tea-chest base gang
I followed him home and he danced as he sang
But now he's gone, not even the slightest traces
Of a Kwela song and the street is full of empty spaces

Nobody knows, did he survive the winding road?
Did he find a song that took him back to the heartland?
Here I stand, lost in the memory
Of a Kwela man, singing in the long gone twilight

When I followed you home Kwela man
You filled my soul, Kwela, Kwela
When you sang your song Kwela man
You gave it your life

All along the river chelmsford's army lay asleep
Come to crush the children of mageba
Come to exact the realm's price for peace
And in the morning as they saddled up to ride
Their eyes shone with the fire and the steel
The general told them of the task that lay ahead
To bring the people of the sky to heel

Warm rain seeping to the bone
They rode through the season's wet weather
Straining for a glimpse of the foe
Hopeless battalion destined to die
Broken by the benders of kings
Vainglorious general and victorian pride
Would cost him and eight hundred men their lives
Chorus
They came to the side of the mountain
Scouts rode out to spy the land
Even as the realm's soldiers lay resting

And by the evening the vultures were wheeling
Above the ruins where the fallen lay
An ancient song as old as the ashes
Echoed as mageba's warriors marched away

And live the future in their image""

But I have my own
Hidden somewhere deep inside of me

In between my father's fields
And the citadels of the rule
Lies a no-man's land which I must cross
To find my stolen jewel.

And I miss you in
A thousand ways

How did it change so fast?

To the past)
I really thought it'd last
All that we had was
So unbelieveable
Now that it's gone
It's just inconceivable
Still in my dreams
You were so damn beautiful
How could it be
That you ruined my

Johnny Conquet,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love
Johnny Cooper,"Every time I run its always to her arms
Its really not quite fair, cause she's just egging me on
Know all I want to do is get lost in your eyes
Just one minute with you babe makes everything alright
I don't know what I'll do to keep from missing you
I don't know what I'll do to keep from missing you
Try to keep busy and hang with all my friends
But you know id rather be with you instead

No matter how far you go I won't ever forget that kiss
Believe me baby you're the reason that I write songs like this
I don't know what I'll do to keep from missing you
I don't know what I'll do to keep from missing you
I bought season tickets, went to every single game
Even went down to the arcade and spent all my change
Invested in a stock and a few D-V-D's

But every little thing I did made me think of you and me
Finally got some peace and quiet on a lonesome Sunday night
Away from the riot of that country music life
So I guess I know just what I gotta do
There ain't no way, there ain't now how to stop missing you
I don't know what I'll do to keep from missing you

But I I can't hold on to you there's 
A look in your eye like you got something to prove'
Either stay or go away, I think it's time for you to choose
I can feel you now, but I can't hold on to you!

Call me crazy if it makes thing right all the little things you put me through!
But there I go I'm living the life I'm living, 
So you're forgiven now go do what you need to do'

And I'll admit that I've been looking the other way
But now that everything is done with a love that once was fun
I wonder if I should get up on my feet again, yeah

And try try to love again
Yea try, try to love again 

Well I've opened up my eyes and I've finally realized
As fast as it left it can all come back again
Yeah, that little funny feeling that you used to know 
And you're not quite sure if it's right to show 
So you keep it all in and hope it never ends

That's why I'll try try to love again. 
Yea, try try to love again all right!

Well I'm not in no big hurry, 
And there's no need to worry time will tell if this treasure's right for me.

Oh, but I wanna know is her heart made of gold' 
I guess I'll just have to wait and see
Maybe she'll come run with me

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue

Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

When you get it, 
If you get it... 

TODD: HAH! 
LOVETT:
Good, you got it! 

Take, for instance, Mrs. Mooney and her pie shop! 
Bus'ness never better using only pussycats and toast! 
And a pussy's good for maybe six or seven at the most! 
And I'm sure they can't compare as far as taste! 

[Simultaneously]

TODD:
Mrs. Lovett, what a charming notion
LOVETT:
Well, it does seem a waste... 

TODD:
Eminently practical
And yet appropriate as always! 
LOVETT:
It's an idea... 

TODD:
Mrs. Lovett, how I've lived
Without you all these years, I'll never know! 
How delectable! 
Also undetectable! 
LOVETT:
Think about it! 
Lots of other gentlemen'll
Soon be comin' for a shave, 
Won't they? 
Think of
All them
Pies! 

TODD:
How choice! 

How
Rare! 

TODD:
For what's the sound of the world out there? 
LOVETT:
What, Mr. Todd? 
What, Mr. Todd? 
What is that sound? 
TODD:
Those crunching noises pervading the air! 
LOVETT:
Yes, Mr. Todd! 
Yes, Mr. Todd! 
Yes, all around! 
TODD:
It's man devouring man, my dear! 
BOTH:
And [LOVETT: Then] who are we to deny it in here? 

TODD: (spoken) These are desperate times, 
Mrs. Lovett, and desperate measures are called for! 
LOVETT: Here we are, now! Hot out of the oven! 
TODD: What is that? 

LOVETT:
It's priest. Have a little priest.
TODD:
Is it really good? 
LOVETT:
Sir, it's too good, at least! 
Then again, they don't commit sins of the flesh, 
So it's pretty fresh.
TODD:
Awful lot of fat.
LOVETT:
Only where it sat.
TODD:
Haven't you got poet, or something like that? 
LOVETT:
No, y'see, the trouble with poet is
'Ow do you know it's deceased? 
Try the priest! 

TODD: (spoken) Heavenly! 
Not as hearty as bishop, perhaps, 
But then again, not as bland as curate, either! 

LOVETT:
And good for business, too -- always leaves you wantin' more! 
Trouble is, we only get it on Sundays! 

Lawyer's rather nice.
TODD:
If it's for a price.
LOVETT:
Order something else, though, to follow, 
Since no one should swallow it twice! 
TODD:
Anything that's lean.
LOVETT:
Well, then, if you're British and loyal, 
You might enjoy Royal Marine! 
Anyway, it's clean.
Though of course, it tastes of wherever it's been! 
TODD:
Is that squire, 
On the fire? 
LOVETT:
Mercy no, sir, look closer, 
You'll notice it's grocer! 
TODD:
Looks thicker, 
More like vicar! 
LOVETT:
No, it has to be grocer --
It's green! 

TODD:
The history of the world, my love --
LOVETT:
Save a lot of graves, 
Do a lot of relatives favors! 
TODD:
Is those below serving those up above! 
LOVETT:
Ev'rybody shaves, 
So there should be plenty of flavors! 
TODD:
How gratifying for once to know
BOTH:
That those above will serve those down below! 

LOVETT: (spoken) Now let's see, here... We've got tinker.
TODD: Something... pinker.
LOVETT: Tailor? 
TODD: Paler.
LOVETT: Butler? 
TODD: Subtler.
LOVETT: Potter? 
TODD: Hotter.
LOVETT: Locksmith? 

Lovely bit of clerk.
TODD:
Maybe for a lark.
LOVETT:
Then again there's sweep
If you want it cheap
And you like it dark! 
Try the financier, 
Peak of his career! 
TODD:
That looks pretty rank.
LOVETT:
Well, he drank, 
It's a bank
Cashier.
Never really sold.
Maybe it was old.
TODD:
Have you any Beadle? 
LOVETT:
Next week, so I'm told! 
Beadle isn't bad till you smell it and
Notice 'ow well it's been greased... 
Stick to priest! 

(spoken) Now then, this might be a little bit stringy, 
But then of course it's... fiddle player! 
TODD: No, this isn't fiddle player -- it's piccolo player! 
LOVETT: 'Ow can you tell? 
TODD: It's piping hot! 
LOVETT: Then blow on it first! 

TODD:
The history of the world, my sweet --
LOVETT:
Oh, Mr. Todd, 
Ooh, Mr. Todd, 
What does it tell? 
TODD:
Is who gets eaten, and who gets to eat! 
LOVETT:
And, Mr. Todd, 
Too, Mr. Todd, 
Who gets to sell! 
TODD:
But fortunately, it's also clear
BOTH:
That [L: But] ev'rybody goes down well with beer! 

LOVETT: (spoken)
Since marine doesn't appeal to you, 'ow about... rear admiral? 
TODD: Too salty. I prefer general.
LOVETT: With, or without his privates? ""With"" is extra.

TODD: What is that? 
LOVETT:
It's fop.
Finest in the shop.
And we have some shepherd's pie peppered
With actual shepherd on top! 
And I've just begun --
Here's the politician, so oily
It's served with a doily, 
Have one! 
TODD:
Put it on a bun.
Well, you never know if it's going to run! 
LOVETT:
Try the friar, 
Fried, it's drier! 
TODD:
No, the clergy is really
Too coarse and too mealy! 
LOVETT:
Then actor, 
That's compacter! 
TODD:
Yes, and always arrives overdone! 
I'll come again when you have JUDGE on the menu! 

LOVETT: (spoken) Wait! True, we don't have judge yet, 
But we've got something you might fancy even better.
TODD: What's that? 
LOVETT: Executioner! 

TODD:
Have charity towards the world, my pet! 
LOVETT:
Yes, yes, I know, my love! 
TODD:
We'll take the customers that we can get! 
LOVETT:
High-born and low, my love! 
TODD:
We'll not discriminate great from small! 
No, we'll serve anyone, 
Meaning anyone,

And to anyone
At all!",A  Little Priest

Should cause you such misery and pain

I dreamed of two blue orchids
So full of love and light
That I wanted to possess each tender bloom

Johnny Dollar,"As the bitter tears fall from your eyes 
a thousand times you ask yourself why 
the one guy you love has departed 
and you're left alone and broken hearted.
Love just comes and it goes.
How long it's gonna last, say, nobody knows.
 
That's The Way Love Is, baby, 
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
That's The Way Love Is, sugar,
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
 
I know you're walkin' down a lonesome road 
and your heart is carryin' a heavy load.
I know you feel like you ain't got a friend 
and your whole world is cavin' in.
Now's the time to be strong, 
you gotta forget him now that he's gone, 
and remember.
 
That's The Way Love Is, baby, 
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
That's The Way Love Is, sugar,
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
 
The road of love gets rough some times don't let it get the best of you.
Said I've been hurt by love so many times,
so I know just what you're goin' through.
You wish that you were never born, you gotta forget him now that he's gone, 
just Remember.
 
That's The Way Love Is, baby, 
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
That's The Way Love Is, sugar,
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
 
Love is here today and gone tomorrow,
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
All of your joys turn to sorrow,
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
One day gladness next day sadness,
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)

And held me closely then stole my heart
Wanted, someone I trusted
Who gave no warning we'd ever part.

He was last seen hiding out in someone's arms
He knew nothing of the danger in his charms
A jury may find him guilty but I'd forgive him if I could see
A signed confession that he'd repented and really wanted no one but me.

Johnny Downing,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear
Johnny Downing,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat

And we've ofter rewound the clock
Since the puritans got a shock
When they landed on Plymouth rock
If today any shock they might try to stem
'Stead of landing of Plymouth rock

In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking

Who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words
Writing prose

If low bars you like
If old hymns you like
If bare limbs you like
If Mae West you like
Or me undressed you like

The set thats smart
Is intruding on nudist parties
In studios
Anything goes

When Mrs. Ned McClean God bless her
Can get Russian reds to yes her
Than I suppose
Anything goes

When Rockafeller still can hoard
Enough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows

And good's bad today
And black's white today
And days night today
And that gent today
You gave a cent today
Once owned several chateaux

When folks
Who still can ride in Jitney's
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitney's
Lack baby clo'es

When Sam Goldwyn
Can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction
Than Anna shows

Now turns a handspring landing up
On her toes

Just think of those shocks you've got
And those knocks you've got
And those blues you've got
From those news you've got
And those pains you've got

For some reason I can't explain

Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums

Just a puppet on a lonely string

You'd want me just to feel as you do too

I could be somewhere else
I should be someone else but
You shouldn't tell me what to do
I'll only take the brakes off if you do
And roll around like marbles on the floor
Please pick me up and roll me out the door

I could be somewhere else
I should be someone else but

I guess I'm happy as I am
Sometimes I find it hard to be a man
It easier just to play the same old game
Of trying to forget my bloody name

I could be somewhere else
I should be someone else but
How are you? I'm Mr,
I know what I'm called
It's just you got me
You've got me
You've got me stalled",Brown Trout Blues
Johnny Flynn,"Well I'm sure you're near
And I can almost smell you
But the winds are up at the walls again

I can hear you coming
Heaven helped you coming
I believe in heaven it's a wait away

Did you learn just how I loved you?
Did you see how far I'd been?
Would you meet me in an hour?
I could tell you what I've seen
What I've seen

[Chorus]
Cold bread
Cold bread
We had

Would you whine in water
Pull your chips back in
So you crawl like a crab across black fries bridge
Suffer none to fade
Hit the homeward road
I'm a bowling green
A delivery boy

Have a heart that skips a beat
Oh come on
Roll along for free
In the middle of the morning
Swap your drinking nights with me
With me

[Chorus: x2]

I can live with dying
I can chew my bit
Play panic to my senses
And hijack my head
It's the rhythm of moving
And a rolling and a rattle
Its a giving instead
It's a well sprung bed
We can roll around forever
We can pray for all we've been
We can knock it hell for leather
We can call it all a dream
All a dream

[Chorus: x2]

For your outward bound
Remember what we found",Cold Bread
Johnny Flynn,"There's a man at hand
There's a way between
The sinking sand
And a crooked dream
And collared off at the modern age of nine
Summoned off for walking down the line

[Chorus]
They lost eyes in old city streets
Where the funeral pyres burned the last of the meek

He filled his boots
And he tipped his cap
And a root to toot
With the boss and that
And told a girl of the summer by the sea
Said to her would you like to go with me

Wind is turned
And the Tonka trucks
And the singers changed
And the hard to soft
In with changes, always out with time
Nothing left but walking down the line

[Chorus]

Dragging loose less through the den
And I come out less with sporting wear
More to fit than you'd be feeling now
She is aware that he is always how

Then her sweetness and his sweeter scented
And her fury's swimming till the fury's bended
And lost in all might be to lost in time
What joy the darts might be to walk the line

[Chorus: x3]",Eyeless in Holloway
Johnny Flynn,"There are ten thousand graves in Hong Kong Protestant Cemetery
Every one of them says ""born and died, and the rest might be history""
Walking there I'd cry
For my love was there to lie
I never knew shame to be so refreshing
I'd sing Georgia on my mind, she would be, I'd be progressing...

Was the day of the boats for the fellas in coats in the Navy
They'd be all around, change the face of this town cos they're lazy
1952 was the year that I lost you
I was with the soldiers in the school hall
Didn't know that you were ill
You didn't seem old

China so you so blue so who's aboard the boatsie stay
Some people are fixing the terrible 
Mixing the crew of all the sailors say,

Your life might be a a mess of lights
When your on your won
But the lights you'll from a line that will be pointing all the way home

To a score of his to get to your seat
I'll send the next in line, he'll be a clean sheet",Hong Kong Cemetry
Johnny Flynn,"I've been drooling at some mangy scraps of bread
And these hungry voices make a lot of noise inside my head
Show me the way to the rubbish dump or the bins at closing time
I'd walk a mile just to catch a smile from a fish without its brine

Been hanging round the underground
Found a couple of crumbs down there
Was lucky and got some flirts
From a girl with long brown hair
She said her name was Mary May and
She liked the springtime, oh
She said she left the meal
Half ate she said she left the crusts of toast

[Chorus]
Leftovers is what I want
Don't need no fine cuisine
Give me a dime for bacon rind
Or slip me some of that old sardine

She'd been seeing a man named Jim
I said I didn't mind
Said the second place is just my style
I'd glasses for the line
I knew she was keen to come and
I knew I'd met my match
I was sure that I had locked the door
And she had dropped the latch

[Chorus]

I said ""bring your dark eyes honey""
She said ""you bring yours""
Said I don't take second glance
So she walked out the door
I walked after her it weighed me down
And asked her why she left
She said she only dealt leftovers
And that all else felt like theft

[Chorus: x2]

If you see her, say hello
She'll be out handing scraps
But don't be fooled, her heart is ruled
By forces off the maps

Johnny Flynn,"Sad about her winsome glance
And mad about the town
Kicking years (?)

Leave a trial of dusted boots
And choose a toecap

I'm a plow
And you're a furrow
I'm a fox
And you're a burrow
I'm a weed
And you the rose

Sally was a daisy chain
And Sally was a rock
And Sally let her hair hang low
And Sally wore a frock
Someone saw a local boy
Crawl along the shore
Well must be someone's son
They thought
They should have thought some more

[Chorus:]

Sally saw the boy come near
Right beneath the sun
Breathing hard and cockle proud
And Sally's heart was won
Not a boy she knew at first
Not a face she'd seen
All whispered through her ready lips
I'll be the best I've been

And it's forty's fingers in her face
Grubby mitts, saving grace
Hope to live, or wait to die
Why don't you like

Chervil gloves and half cocked eyes
Bring nature to their deviled lives
Winsome missus wantoning lads
Aging in their passing fads
Leave a trial of dusted boots

Johnny Flynn,"Shore to shore, got some land between
Island life is living from a cup of broken queens 
Hit the jackpot rolling through a pipe dream in a knot
And I'm missing what was pissing up the wall that I forgot
I forgot, I forgot

I am the bus driver, give me some grace
You've never seen me and you don't know my face
She was no Hattie Carroll it was cold, it was blue
And it only happened despite me or you
Me or you, me or you

Smoking paper to the crimson flashing bars
Drinking cocktail wine or cottage cream and passing strangers' cars
Live in one room housing with a roof to meet the sky
Spelling Jesus won't you please us 'cos you seem a damn nice guy
Damn nice guy, damn nice guy

We listened to passengers stamping old songs
And we lose what's to lose when you haven't done wrong
Drums too slow for a funeral beat
No strumming of strings and no stamping of feet
Of feet, of feet

It's awfully considerate of you to think of me
And it's not so hard to see you smoking fags and drinking tea
It's the crummy lost at seasick with a floating on the waves
To join the other flotsam with the ripped up queens and knaves
Queens and knaves, queens and knaves

There lies a lady, she's gone and she's gone
She'll be a fine lady before too long
But I hit her head and she finished her walking
She shouldn't be dead, she was too busy talking
Busy talking, busy talking

They can fill a cup or two and still disturb the peace
It's never made it all the way from shore to shore, from west to east
I read that independence was a lightness in your step
You walked away, I felt so heavy at the start of every day
Every day, every day

I've been waiting an hour and the bus hasn't come
I've been cursing my God for the lack of the sun
I've been ruined by destiny, lowered by fate

To be late, to be late",Shore to Shore
Johnny Flynn,"I knew no vices and I knew no sins
I knew the words but they didn't sink in
Stayed out those tunnels that pull people down
There's more of those tunnels in your home town
Fell far from grace, so far I couldn't see
And oh underground, I was that far from the tree

We're all digging if you wanna know
Fixing, digging, far too slow
Far too slow

We dug for money, we shoveled four tons
And the end wasn't funny, though we'd all had fun
Limping and broken, the tunnel fell in
I've been limping from tunnels since my original sin
Birthright's a trouble, my father dug too
He got where he was going at the age of 62

We're all digging if you wanna know
Fixing, digging, far too slow
Far too slow

A new pair of boots and a chisel in your name
Says we could be in the same hole attracting the same blame
If I knew the way to the ornamental tree
I would tell you, we'd be jailbirds, I'd be winking twice for free
Don't call on your brother, odds are he's here and all
Being gentle with the people who were knock-kneed from the fall

What of all those wayward priests?
The ones who like to drink
Do you suppose they'd swap their blood for wine
Like you swapped yours for ink, for ink

You wrote me oh so many letters
And all of them seemed true
Promises look good on paper
Especially from you, from you

The weight of all those willing words
I carried all alone
You wouldn't put your pen to bed
When we hadn't found our own, our own

Your sentences rose high at night
And circled round my head
The circle's since been broken
Like the priest before me is breaking bread

I'm being asked to drink the blood of Christ
And soon I'll eat his flesh
I'm alone again before the altar
Shedding all my old regrets

The last of which I'll tell you now
As it flies down the sink
I never knew a part of you
You didn't set in ink, in ink

The letters that you left behind
No longer shall I read
Your blood's between the pages
And I can't stand to see you bleed

And I'll soon forget what was never there
Your words are ash and dust
All that's left is the song I've sung
The breath I've taken and the one I must

Pushed back through the leafy ground

When nothing goes right
And the future's dark as night
What you need is a sunny sunny day

Don't know where I can buy a heart

And the glowing mold of fear

Gonna blow out all of the lights

We'll steer her home tonight
We'll steer her home tonight

In the elegant sails of infinity
And the blowing winds of old love
Are the words from the mouths of the delicate crowds
In the shimmering realms up above

And Samson's will is the theme

Slapping sense to its peak and a hard strung out week
And so back to the love in our sails

For I just cannot stay
Or I'll sink in my skin and my bones

The water sustains me without even trying

One that'll ride on the flow
Where the river runs deep
And the larger fish creep
I'm glad of what keeps me afloat

With my dying

Now deeper the water I sail
And faster the current I'm in

And the song in my heart
Is a tune for the journeyman's tale

The water sustains me without even trying
The water can't drown me, I'm done
With my dying

Now the land that I knew is a dream
And the line on the distance grows faint
So wide is my river, the horizon a sliver
The artist has run out of paint

Where the blue of the sea meets the sky
And the big yellow sun leads me home
I'm everywhere now, the way is a vow
To the wind of each breath by and by

What's behind and what is near

A symphony, sans right or wrong

I met you when the weather got fine
You said 'I've got yours if you've got mine

And the worst and best of all we knew
Stayed out to rust in the morning dew

Didn't take long to sing our love
Was a harvest feast, was a hand to glove
When winter came you couldn't stand to sit
You just the same never burnt but lit
With a world at war and my thoughts on you
I didn't care to fall, there wasn't much to do

And the worst and best of all we knew
Stayed out to rust in the morning dew

Churlish May when the year was fair
Gone full circle when things went square
Ate my meal an un-noble beast
Left me to pay not a movable feast
Look I got nothing, dunno where I am
Got a fistful of questions, not an answer to hand

And the worst and best of all we knew
Stayed out to rust in the morning dew
Morning dew
With a blow me down the road, dead in the wood

Further from you now, then the roots from the leaves
Drunk on the wood, never seen any trees
My ore's out the water and the lake that I'm sailing
Is your dear father's daughter and it's cold and I'm ailing
Are you drowning me slowly, was the school meant to teach
Are you leaving so slowly, where's the shore, where's the beach?

Both fighting for inheritance
Both entitled to their day

And loosed my shoes
Come join me in the ring my friend
Quit these lonesome blues
Quit my lonesome blues'

The lady thought the longest while
And bathed the time in light
She came to the conclusion
That he hadn't won the fight
'Put your gloves back on,' she says
'And steady with your pride
You've dealt the eldest hand my love
But that part of me has died'

I'm a fortune telling concubine
I'm a troubleshot saloon

And you're light as a balloon
I'd rather chase my options now
And place you in the past
The future's not yet written
Though the die behind me is cast
The die behind me is cast

I don't know anything about you
But I'm sure that the doors of perception
Are true in their ways

I'll tell you where I've been

Johnny Flynn,"I was born with this story, it's older than I
And yet you when you hear it you'll know in the sky
In the wind of your knowledge, In the cut of your jib
That the fibre of wind is as new from my lip
As was ever and more and ever will be
'Til the union we face casts us finally free

For we in the love of an earth-bidden dance
Stand enthralled of that, which from heaven, perchance
Lets us move with the gifts we were given in grace
And smile in the arms of Sweet William's embrace

William's wanderings took him abroad
Showed him the lay of the searcher's long road
To the place he stood now 'neath the black laden sky
And the crook of his father had brought fortune nigh
Read the sign where he looked, Not the bull, nor the bear
Nor a burly red lion, or the tortoise and hare

For we in the love of an earth-bidden dance
Stand enthralled of it, which from heaven, perchance
Lets us move with the gifts we were given in grace
And smile in the arms of Sweet William's embrace

The end of the world was the name of the inn
Said fair William farewell to the world and its sin
Its sin

Full balmy was the winter air
All wet with what might die
A wishing well, the ocean bear
A millpond in his eyes
A glance to see from whence he came
For William with a landlocked turn
Vermin what he stood to lose
The skin-shot snakes and earthy worms

His boots trod soft inside the inn
His greeted all was here
Abrasive lowly nods came back
Then bent toward their beer
They must know I thought Willy now
They've seen me come from miles
The thought was struck as whisky poured
And barmen gave all smiles

Then followed this a curious thing
The eldest of the host
Sang softly where he sat and drank
To love a worthy toast
His song was of a stranger
Summoned for his rope
In all would be to set us free
His song was strong and bold,
It went

For we in the love of an earth-bidden dance
Stand enthralled of that, which from heaven, perchance
Lets us move with the gifts we were given in grace
And smile in the arms of Sweet William's embrace

Johnny Flynn,"All that I have is a river
The river is always my home
Lord, take me away 
For I just cannot stay
Or I'll sink in my skin and my bones

The water sustains me without even trying
The water can't drown me, I'm done
With my dying

Please help me build a small boat
One that'll ride on the flow
Where the river runs deep
And the larger fish creep
I'm glad of what keeps me afloat

The water sustains me without even trying
The water can't drown me, I'm done
With my dying

Now deeper the water I sail
And faster the current I'm in
That each night brings the stars
And the song in my heart 
Is a tune for the journeyman's tale

The water sustains me without even trying
The water can't drown me, I'm done
With my dying

Now the land that I knew is a dream
And the line on the distance grows faint
So wide is my river
The horizon a sliver
The artist has run out of paint

Where the blue of the sea meets the sky
And the big yellow sun leads me home
I'm everywhere now
The way is a vow 
To the wind of each breath by and by

The water sustains me without even trying
The water can't drown me, I'm done

Johnny Flynn,"My age is my condition
My love is my intent
I'll pay time with ageless love
I'll forget what came and went
For a well full of content

There's a space in the heavens
There's a hole in my heart
There's a lack of fine dining gone to work on my art
And a flavour of fullness
Is an empty retreat
And the restaurant buffet isn't all I can eat

My love is my intent
I'll pay time with ageless love
I'll forget what came and went

Too quick to get down

And my bones are still white
I haven't the patience to stay out tonight

My age is my condition
My love is my intent
I'll pay time with ageless love
Or forget what came and went
For a well full of content

Stuck with thoughts of the buttercups
And the bees that do naught
But suck on the yellow as nature has taught
I'll suck on the colors that I find in the sea
The blues and the greens, they don't bother me

My age is my condition
My love is my intent
I'll pay time with ageless love
I'll forget what came and went
For a well full of content

My soul is in the trees
It's in the sap that fills the wood
It's in the rings that tell her age
It's in the smoke that marks the days
It's in the fire in my heart
It's in the embers in the soot
It's in the place I put the ash
It's in the soil
It's in the grass
It's in the mouths of all the herd 
It's in the beetles and the birds
It's in the feathers that I found one morning lying on the ground
It's hallelujah, aye and oh
It's where I've been and where I go
It's in the people that I meet
It's kneeling silent at their feet
It's ever dutifully yours
It stems my pride
And opens doors

Seems I’ll do that old rag, takes me all kinds of ways

But I’m from the country, and it’s better not knowing

And I’ve only got so near (Illuminate me)
And I’ve only gone so far (Illuminate me)
And I’ll walk another country mile
I’ll see another star

The poplars, and willows, and birds pass me by
The mould of the earth to the space in the sky
Free from my roots and I’m lost in the wind
Wind on the mountain, and the mountain’s my friend

And I’ve only got so near (Illuminate me)
And I’ve only gone so far (Illuminate me)
And I’ll walk another country mile
I’ll see another star

Hemlock and yew have me toeing the line
Questions come knocking, I’ll answer in time
But the seams of the soil unravel with ease
Nose to the road and I’m painfully free

And I’ve only got so near (Illuminate me)
And I’ve only gone so far (Illuminate me)
And I’ll walk another country mile
I’ll see another star

Call me the wind in the hole
Blowing my way to the call
I’ll dust up the days 'til I’ve gone every way
No less and I’ve never wanted more, more, more

Lost on the bough in a golden refrain
Sleep goes away and the day comes again
But the rain on my cap has me chasing a roof
I’ll be this young choice 'til I’m long in the tooth

And I’ve only got so near (Illuminate me)
And I’ve only gone so far (Illuminate me)
And I’ll walk another country mile
I’ll see another star

I remember you well from before you were born

Truthful as a prism

But the mystery walked, and the mystery spoke
My saint said, “Never fear her.”

Now Mab is my queen
Oh, and Mab is my chief
Mab is my root now
And strong trunk, and branch to the leaf

Are they flourished in times that were guarded with wool
You know limbless they marched till they fell off the map.
Are you sick of them falling like crumbs on your lap

And the band started up and the lady is risen.

All things might wind up but they always unravel 
And I'll watch you with eyes that can see I can see

Dance to?

You should be wary what you listen to
How every song you love will turn into one note
That echos on everything, one note

Sweaty kids on pills aren't kids anymore
You're 24 and still chewing your insides out

All the guys at the back bar talking shit about our
Band

Some unmarked cars I wish I never stepped out in front

Johnny Gill,"I remember how it was when we were flying high in love, we were so proud
It's like we're shadowing the scene and we can see far above all of the clouds
There was storms going on, lovers fighting at home, down on the ground
But because of where we were, we could not see the rain or hear the sound, yeah

Had to put my seatbelt back on
Please tell me something, even if it's just goodbye
Grab the parachute, let's jump before we die

What we did wrong that made our love not last (made our love not last)
I wish there was a way to figure out
Just what it was that made our love life crash (ooh ooh ooh)
I wish there was a way to find out (said I wish, I wish)
What broke our hearts and it would hurt us the most (ooh)
Oh I wish love came with a black box, a black box

I remember when you and I would always slip away
While everyone else was sleeping baby you and I was creeping
We never put our seatbelts on, we never played it safe
Nevermind the turbulence, it only made us brave
Girl nothing else mattered we only cared bout getting by
We were on top of the world, the way we frequently fly, you and I

I wish there was a way to find out (I wish, I wish, I wish)
What broke our hearts and it would hurt us the most (somebody tell me, oh oh oh oh)
Oh I wish love came with a black box, a black box

I was going through all the rubble, just to find out what got us in trouble
I would search through anything for you and me
So I could finally see what made you stop loving me
Exactly what it was that made us fall for all our love
So I could fix it and make you fall back in love with me,

I wish there was a way to find out
What we did wrong that made our love not last 
(I wanna know, I wanna know right now)
I wish there was a way to figure out

Just what it was that made our love life crash

I wish there was a way to find out 
(I don't want to say goodbye)
What broke our hearts and it would hurt us the most

You're the sweetest thing, an easy song to sing
Your like a work of art, so priceless to me
A timeless beauty from the movie screen, that never ever seems to fade

I'm gonna use it at 4 P.M.

So if you want your freedom P.D.Q.

When you'll be feelin' blue

Johnny Gimble,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo

Johnny Gimble,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Johnny Griffin,"The moment I saw him smile
I knew he was just my style
My only regret is we've never met
Though I dream of him all the while
But he doesn't know I exist
No matter how I may persist
So it's clear to see there's no hope for me
Though I live at fifty-one-thirty-five Kensington Avenue
And he lives at fifty-one-thirty-three
How can I ignore the boy next door
I love him more than I can say
Doesn't try to please me
Doesn't even tease me
And he never sees me glance his way
And though I'm heart-sore, the boy next door
Affection for me won't display
I just adore him
So I can't ignore him
The boy next door
I just adore him
So I can't ignore him

Johnny Griffin,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me",I Cried for You

When I say to you

Do you love me

Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?

Gloomy is Sunday--with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all

Death is no dream, for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things

But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Johnny Griffin,"The summer wind came blowin' in
From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair 
And walk with me

All summer long
We sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than
The piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you to
The summer wind 

The autumn wind
And the winter wind
They have come and they have gone
And still the days
Those lonely days
Go on and on

And guess who sighs a lullaby
To nights that never end?
My fickle friend,
The summer wind
Mmm the summer wind
The summer wind
The summer wind",Summerwind
Johnny Griffin,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,

Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Et tu n'as rien dit lorsque je t'ai tutoyée
Sur un ton que j'ai parfois un peu familier
Si tu n'as pas rougi ce soir-là
Parce que ma main glissa sur ton bras
C'est la faute, c'est la faute au twist

Du rythme excitant
Ainsi va l'amour
Et on a tout fait
Pour plaire à l'amour

Ainsi bien qu'on dansait et riait sans raison
Et puis j'ai pu profiter de cette occasion
Pour te serrer, serrer bien plus fort
Bien plus fort contre mon corps
Ca va de soi
C'est la faute, c'est la faute au twist

Et c'est ainsi que nous nous sommes aimés
Si nous avons commis quelques petits péchés
Si tu m'as cédé sans façon
Souvent je me pose la question

Est-ce bien, bien la faute au twist?
N'est-ce pas la faute à l'amour?
N'est-ce pas la faute à tes yeux?
N'est-ce pas la faute ton corps?

Sans relever la tête de son métier

A la pensée du sam'di soir 

Qu'on attend plein d'espoir 
Cœur battant sam'di soir 
Que l'on veut pour pouvoir 
Etre heureux sam'di soir 
On peut s'aimer sans être dérangé

On s'enflamme, on s'amuse et rit 
Et ça vit ça chahute et ça chauffe 

Et l'on danse en scandant sa joie 
Et l'on chante en claquant des doigts 
Et ça crie, ça remue et ça chauffe 

La joie dans nos yeux brille 
On oublie tout 
Et vivement qu'on s'habille 
Et comme un fou 
On va chercher sa fille et ses copains 
Et ses copains au rendez-vous

Pour ton coeur que j'ai cassé
Je voulais te dire merci

Pour ce morceau de ta vie
Que j'ai dévoré
Ce séjour au paradis
Je voulais te dire merci

N'attends pas de moi
Que je rampe comme un chien
N'espère pas de moi
Que je t'avoue mon chagrin
Je veux simplement te dire merci

",Merci (Tender Memory)
Johnny Hallyday,"Je vous préviens, n'approchez pas, que vous soyez flic ou badaud
Je tue celui qui fait un pas, non, je ne ferai pas de cadeau
Et éteignez tous ces projecteurs et baissez vos fusils braqués
Non, je ne vais pas m'envoler sans elle
Dites au curé, dites au pasteur qu'ailleurs ils aillent se faire pendre
Le diable est passé de bonne heure et mon âme n'est plus à vendre
Si vous me laissez cette nuit, à l'aube je vous donnerai ma vie
Car que serait ma vie sans lui

Je n'étais qu'un fou mais par amour
Elle a fait de moi un fou, un fou d'amour
Mon ciel, c'était ses yeux, sa bouche
Ma vie, c'était son corps, son corps
Je l'aimais tant que pour la garder, je l'ai tuée
Pour qu'un grand amour vive toujours
Il faut qu'il meurt, qu'il meurt d'amour

Le jour se lève, la nuit pâlit, les chasseurs et les chiens ont faim
C'est l'heure de sonner l'hallali, la bête doit mourir ce matin
Je vais ouvrir grand les volets, crevez-moi le cœur, je suis prêt
Je veux m'endormir pour toujours

Je n'étais qu'un fou mais par amour
Elle a fait de moi un fou, un fou d'amour
Mon ciel, c'était ses yeux, sa bouche
Ma vie, c'était son corps, son corps
Je l'aimais tant que pour la garder, je l'ai tuée
Je ne suis qu'un fou, qu'un fou, un fou d'amour
Un pauvre fou qui meurt, qui meurt d'amour.",Requiem Pour un Fou

Encore bourré comme un métro
Non, j'ai pas dis qu' tu l'aimais trop

T'es encore cuit comme un œuf dur
T'es encore gelé comme un coing

C'est pas facile de jouer les durs

C'est pas comme ça que tu l'oublieras
C'est pas comme ça, c'est pas comme ça

On n'oublie pas comme ça

T'es complètement à l'abandon
T'es crucifié, t'es délatté
Mais tu vas pas te laisser crever
Pour cette n'en parlons plus, viens donc

Viens, on va faire la route à pied
On va marcher le nez dans le ciel
Foutre des coups de pied dans les poubelles
Et on va rire à en pleurer

Après deux siècles de repentir
Vous m'avez rappelé en pleine gloire
Où sont les filles du paradis?
Où sont les filles du paradis?

L'ange qui rigole derrière mon dos
M'a pourtant dit, y a quelques secondes
Que pour m'être tenu à carreau
Je verrai les plus belles filles du monde

Comment se peut-il qu'un de vos saints
Puisse ainsi sous vos yeux parjurer?
Vous avez dit, ""Tu ne mentiras point
C'est une de mes dix volontés""

Vous ne m'avez pas créé sur terre
Pour que l'amour me soit banni
Faut-il que je m'adresse au grand Saint-Pierre
Pour voir les filles du paradis?
Pour voir les filles du paradis

L'ange qui rigole derrière mon dos
M'a pourtant dit, y a quelques secondes
Que pour m'être tenu à carreau
Je verrai les plus belles filles du monde

Ici-bas, j'étais heureux je chantais
Et si je n'étais pas un bon fils
Je n'étais pas un mauvais sujet
Je priais bien souvent en coulisse

L'ange qui rigole derrière mon dos
M'a pourtant dit, y a quelques secondes
Que pour m'être tenu à carreau

Dans une maison en bois en dehors de la ville
Le feu était mort dans la cheminée
J'ai commencé à écrire cette chanson

Et il neige sur Nashville, il neige sur Nashville

Nous sommes sortis très tôt, nous avons marché très loin
Sur ce qui devait être une ancienne voie ferrée
Dans le quartier où les noirs montrent le poing
Où les chiens nombreux cherchent à manger

Et il neige sur Nashville, il neige sur Nashville

Ce soir quelque chose va changer dans son regard
Elle a noué autour du cou son foulard
Il était noir la couleur de mon chapeau
Je sais déjà que je ne vais plus la revoir

Et il neige sur Nashville, il neige sur Nashville

Quand elle se réveillera dans le matin
Je serai déjà dans l'avion là-haut dans le ciel
Je voudrais juste savoir si elle pense à moi
Comme moi je pense encore à elle

Et il neige sur Nashville, il neige sur Nashville
Ouais, j'ai au fond du cœur un peu de neige de Nashville

Et il neige sur Nashville, il neige sur Nashville
Ouais, j'ai au fond du cœur un peu de neige de Nashville

J'étais un homme y a pas longtemps
J'ai peur d'être un enfant

Et faire de mon mieux
Pour ne pas sombrer et ne pas craquer
Je sais bien que je n'aimerai plus vraiment
À partir de maintenant
De maintenant

À partir de maintenant
Comment pourrais-je faire l'amour
Comme on faisait l'amour
Je connaissais son corps par coeur
Et son coeur à elle
Était déjà loin ailleurs

Avec elle j'avais du talent
J'étais drôle et je me sentais plus fort qu'un géant
Je voulais lui faire un enfant
Je ne veux plus d'enfant
À partir de maintenant, de maintenant

À partir de maintenant
Pour elle commence une autre vie
Pour moi la jalousie
Sans le connaître je hais cet homme
Car je sais quel amour elle donne
Quand elle se donne

",A Partir de Maintenant
Johnny Hallyday,"J'ai compris quand j'ai eu ma première vrai guitare
Que commençait la ma vie et mon histoire
J'ai chanté sur trois accords que je connaissais
Ma première musique déjà 1ui ressemblait

Le blues de ma vie
Blues dans mon c?ur
De brouillards de pluie
Quand j'avais le splin sans amour sans amis

Après il y a eu pour moi la première vraie chanson
En lettre de feu j'ai vu briller mon nom
Au fond de moi un démon me poussait
Et sans le savoir malgré moi je chantais

Le blues de ma vie
Le rock 'n roll
le blues de mes nuits
Rendait la musique et les filles folles folles folles

La moitié de ma vie je la passe sur la scène
A chanter l'amour la violence la peine et la haine
Si je ne sais plus ce que j'ai fait de première guitare
Je n'ai pas oublié ce blues qui chante dans ma mémoire

Et c'est toujours le blues de ma vie
Le rock 'n roll
Tout devient folie
La musique et les filles sont folles folles folles

Je suis bien tellement bien, je suis loin
Derrière moi l'orchestre tourne tourne bien
J'oublie tout, je suis fou, loin de tout
Quand les guitares crient et qu'un saxo pleure dans la nuit
Blues de ma vie

Et puis l'amour est venu briller dans mon ciel
Elle avait des yeux d'or et des cheveux couleur de miel
J'ai eu si mal que j'ai fini par croire que j'étais mort
Et c'est un peu pour elle que chaque soir je chante encore

Le blues de ma vie
Le rock 'n roll
Le blues de l'oubli
Qu'elle m'a laissé au c?ur avant qu'elle ne s'envole

J'ai compris ce jour d'été où elle est partie
Que je n'aimerai plus jamais de ma vie
Et dans mon c?ur il ne peut plus vraiment faire très froid
On reste tout seul
Le blues ma guitare et moi

Et je chante le blues de ma vie
Et je chante le blues de l'oubli
Et je chante le blues dans la nuit
Et je chante le blues de ma vie...","Le Blues, Ma Guitare et Moi"

Johnny Hallyday,"A ma naissance, cinquante centimètres
Trois kilos deux et les yeux bleu pâle
Une espèce de duvet sur la tête
A part ça, tout est normal

Fils unique plein d'affection
Et, c'est bien logique
Sans profession

Quinze ans après, j'ai pris la route
Je devais partir pour assumer
Mais au fond du cœur, j'avais des doutes
J'aimais trop la liberté

Bon physique sans prétention
Caractéristique, sans profession

Sans profession

Vingt bougies sur mon dernier gâteau
Que j'ai soufflées entre deux cuisses
Avant d'arriver sous les drapeaux
Amené par la police

Erotique, plein de passion
Oui, mais pour les flics
Sans profession

Sans profession

Dix ans plus tard, beaucoup de souvenirs
Peu de bons par rapport aux pourris
Ceux que l'on cherche à détruire
Et qui reviennent chaque nuit

Romantique, plein d'émotion
Tendre et sympathique
Sans profession

Sans profession

Et cent quatre-vingt-cinq centimètres
Mais dans mon linceul, un corps parfait
Pas de lichen collé à mon être

Mais sur l'acte de décès
Fils unique, plein d'ambition
Mort pour la musique
Sans profession

Sans profession

Je suis sans profession

Johnny Hallyday,"Toute ma vie, j'ai roulé sur des routes incertaines, inhumaines
Pas de valises, pas d'enfants, pas de femmes
Il ne me reste plus aucune chaîne
Dans cette voiture pourrie

Y a des souvenirs d'amours qui sont morts en une nuit
On s'aimait au Texas
On s'aime plus en Californie
Le temps que la route défile

De ville en ville
Je ne sais plus bien ce que j'allais chercher
Et dans la lumière de mes phares, aveuglé
J'ai cru voir, tout mon passé
Qui défilait, halluciné

Je suis rien qu'un fantôme, qui roule le long des routes
Je ressemble à tous ceux que j'ai connus sans doute
Je suis toutes ces filles, ces hommes, ces pauvres mômes
J'suis rien qu'un fantôme

Je suis un menteur, je suis un amant, un loser, un enfant
Un cow-boy, un marin, un bagnard, un gitan
Un cinglé, un poète, une putain, une maman
Je suis rien qu'un fantôme

Dans ma vieille caisse usée, ont brûlé des milliers de cigarettes
Tous les rêves, tous les rires, les amis
Aujourd'hui, qu'est-ce qu'il reste
Ma vie comme un nuage
J'aurai voulu au moins conserver ton image

Je t'ai connue à Phoenix
Je t'ai perdue à Vegas
Le temps que la route se passe

De ville en ville
De ville en ville

Dans mes phares
J'en ai tant vu filer
J'en ai tant connu que je mélange, filles d'hôtels
Types étranges
Tous les démons
Et tous les anges
Et toutes mes fautes

Je suis rien qu'un fantôme, qui roule le long des routes
Je ressemble à tous ceux que j'ai connus sans doute
Je suis toutes ces filles, ces hommes, ces pauvres mômes
Rien qu'un fantôme

Je suis un menteur, je suis un amant, un loser, un enfant
Un cow-boy, un marin, un bagnard, un gitan
Un cinglé, un poète, une putain, une maman
Je suis rien qu'un fantôme

Rien qu'un fantôme
Je suis rien qu'un fantôme
Je suis toutes ces filles, ces hommes, ces pauvres mômes
Rien qu'un fantôme

Toute la nuit j'ai compté les chemins parcourus, le temps perdu
Je savais plus qui j'étais
Où j'étais, quand le matin est venu

Et le moteur s'est tu
Et je suis sorti pour voir ma Cadillac foutue
Et ça m'a fait marrer, cette pauvre chose, délabrée
Qui ressemblait à mon passé

Je suis rien qu'un fantôme, qui roule le long des routes
Je ressemble à tous ceux que j'ai connus sans doute
Je suis toutes ces filles, ces hommes, ces pauvres mômes
Rien qu'un fantôme

Je suis un menteur, je suis un amant, un loser, un enfant
Un cow-boy, un marin, un bagnard, un gitan
Un cinglé, un poète, une putain, une maman
Rien qu'un fantôme

Johnny Hallyday,"Toute la nuit, il a joué sur sa guitare
Au fond d’un vieux café
Un peu de soleil, sur le goudron mouillé
Les gens s’en vont, le jour va se lever

C’est la dernière chanson d’un amour blessé
Y a la guerre quelque part, loin du café
Comme un amour bizarre qui veut jamais rentrer
Tout ça est normal et la guitare fait…mal

La femme qui vient le soir, s’habille en noir
Elle sourit quand il joue le blues
Elle demande chaque soir la même chanson
La même chanson qui est toute son histoire

Et c’est son parfum qui traîne dans le matin
On empile les chaises, pour balayer
C’est toute une histoire qu’il faudrait oublier
Tout ça est normal et la guitare fait…mal

Il y a pas si longtemps, pas très longtemps
Il jouait pour pouvoir l’aimer
Malgré les journées où il perdait sa vie
Pour la voir arriver quand venait la nuit

Il attend la nuit et cette femme aussi
Comme on attend son dernier train
Qui va l’emporter vers son vrai destin
Tout ça est normal et la guitare fait…mal

Johnny Hallyday,"Love the way you wear you hair down long
Like the way your voice sounds on the telephone
You know you're looking sexy in tight blue jeans
But there's one thing I got to ask you please

Do you have a garter belt
Would you wear stockings
Do you have a garter belt
Would you wear stockings

I don't mean to put no heat on you
But I wonder if you feel the way I do 
You don't have to worry ?cause it's alright
I ain't kinky baby, I know what I like

Would you wear stockings
If I call out for help

Johnny Hallyday,"Au grand cirque de pierres, sous le soleil de juin
Des hommes, assis par terre, ont bravé le destin
C'était pourtant hier et c'est déjà si loin

Je m'en souviens
Un printemps comme les autres que celui de Pékin
A qui est-ce la faute si on n'en dit plus rien?
C'était pourtant hier, qu'en ferons-nous demain?
Qu'en ferons-nous demain?

A force de subir les coups
Y a des cris que l'on n'entend plus
Des voix qui n'ont plus d'autres issues
Que de maudire sans mot dire

A force de haïr les fous
Y a des hommes qui lèvent leurs chaînes
Mourir peut-être, mais debout
A tien an men

Une génération muselée, mutilée
De sa révolution qu'on n'a pas écoutée
C'était pourtant hier, c'est déjà oublié
Mais ce n'est rien

Si le corps est vaincu, brûle toujours la flamme
Que rien n'éteindra plus à l'écueil de son âme
C'est encore aujourd'hui et ce sera demain
Et ce sera demain

A force de subir les coups
Y a des hommes qui brisent leurs chaînes
Mourir peut-être, mais debout

Quand tes mains voudraient bien
Quand tes doigts n'osent pas
Quand ta pudeur dit non
D'une toute petite voix 

Que je t'aime, que je t'aime, que je t'aime
Que je t'aime, que je t'aime, que je t'aime 

Quand tu ne te sens plus chatte
Et que tu deviens chienne
Et qu'à l'appel du loup
Tu brises enfin tes chaînes

Quand ton premier soupir
Se finit dans un cri
Quand c'est moi qui dis non
Quand c'est toi qui dis oui

Que je t'aime, que je t'aime, que je t'aime
Que je t'aime, que je t'aime, que je t'aime 

Quand mon corps sur ton corps
Lourd comme un cheval mort
Ne sait pas, ne sait plus
S'il existe encore

Quand on a fait l'amour
Comme d'autres font la guerre
Quand c'est moi le soldat
Qui meurt et qui la perd

Que je t'aime, que je t'aime, que je t'aime
Que je t'aime, que je t'aime, que je t'aime 

Que je t'aime
Que je t'aime","Je T'Aime, Je T'Aime, Je T'Aime"

Ferait boucler toute la contrée

Je ne connais que le vent
Et sous le soleil qui danse
Les silhouettes des truands

Quelque part dans un village
Y a trois planches et quatre murs
Une petite vieille et un petit vieux
Qui me cacheront c'est sûr

Dans leur jardin sous un arbre
A la pelle et au râteau
J'ai planqué toutes mes armes
Quatre flingues et trois couteaux

Elle a dû être très belle
Est-ce que son sable était blanc?

Qui a nagé dans cette rivière?
Vous prétendez qu'elle était fraîche
Et descendait de la montagne?
Est-ce qu'il y avait des galets

Dans le creux de chaque cascade?
J'aurais bien aimé plonger mon corps

Et de l'herbe, et des fleurs
Et de l'eau, et des pierres
Et des arbres, et des oiseaux?
Allons, ne vous moquez pas de moi

Qui a marché dans ce chemin?
Vous dites qu'il menait à une maison
Et qu'il y avait des enfants qui jouaient autour?
Vous êtes sûrs que la photo n'est pas truquée?

Vous pouvez m'assurer que cela a vraiment existé?
Dites-moi, allons, ne me racontez plus d'histoires
J'ai besoin de toucher et de voir pour y croire

Poursuivant des enfants
Ils courent dans ma direction
Rêvent de musique
Aux couleurs de cristal
Qui réclament ma protection

Aux ongles de diamant
Ont capturé mon esprit
Sous un ciel de feu

Reviennent autour de ma vie

Et tu t'es joué de moi sans façon

Tous ces nouveaux amis qui l'aiment
Seront partis dans la semaine
Dans sa loge : des photos, des fleurs
Une certaine image du Bonheur

Il fait le vide dans sa tête
Il fait le vide dans son cœur

C'est un chanteur abandonné
Qui a vécu sans se retourner
Sûr que le blues est inventé
Pour lui, cette nuit

Parce qu'il a su s'abandonner
A ceux qui ont voulu l'aimer
Il a donné ce qu'il avait

Mais lui, il se demande qui il est
Abandonné, oui, abandonné

Et la fille qui l'attend
Qui l'aime comme un enfant
Sans qu'il parle, elle comprend
Sa vie, comme c'est bon d'être heureux

Oh, comme c'est bon d'oublier
Que tellement de lumière
Ça peut faire mal aux yeux
Et ça fait le vide dans sa tête
Oui ça fait le vide dans son cœur

Sûr que le blues est inventé
Pour lui, cette nuit

A ceux qui ont voulu l'aimer
Il a donné ce qu'il avait
Mais lui, il se demande qui il est
Abandonné, oui, abandonné

Tant pis s'il faut payer
D'avoir toujours donné.
C'est beau et il le sait

Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
I'm a poorman's son, from across the railroad tracks
The only shirt I own is hangin' on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy 
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while 
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new 
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
I'm a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised 
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
No one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poorman's son
She says give her the things that money can buy 
But I'll never, never make my baby cry
And it's all right, what I can't do
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby ev'rything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight

Je suis né à Paris
Vous me connaissez mieux sous le nom de Johnny

Un soir de juin en 1943
Je suis né dans la rue par une nuit d'orage
Oh oui, je suis né dans la rue
Oh oui, je suis né dans la rue, dans la rue, dans la rue

Je suis né dans la ville où les murs sont toujours gris
Derrière un terrain vague où se trouvent les taudis
Dans un berceau de fer je devais grandir
Ne vous étonnez pas si je ne sais pas sourire

Parce que je suis né dans la rue
Oh oui, je suis né dans la rue, dans la rue

Je n'ai pas eu de père pour me faire rentrer le soir
Et bien, souvent ma mère travaillait pendant la nuit
Je jouais de la guitare assis sur le trottoir
Le cœur comme une pierre je commençais ma vie

Parce que je suis né dans la rue
Je suis né dans la rue, dans la rue, dans la rue

J'ai du me battre pour avoir la vie que j'aimais
J'ai du me battre encore plus fort pour la garder
De tous les côtés de la ville on me cherchait
Les poings se sont serrés depuis je n'ai pas changé

Parce que je suis né dans la rue
Oh, oui, je suis né dans la rue, dans la rue

Maintenant je ne vie plus où les murs sont toujours gris
Mon nom est en argent et ma guitare est en or
Mes chansons d'hier sont bien les mêmes qu'aujourd'hui
Mais quand la nuit arrive je retourne dans la rue

Parce que je suis né dans la rue
Oh je suis né dans la rue, dans la rue
Oh oui
Dans la rue, ouhais, ouhais

On me parle avec respect, je dîne chez des rois
On me choisit mes amis, les meilleurs qui soient
On voudrait me faire changer, mais c'est une cause perdue
Vous perdez votre temps, je reviendrai à la rue

Parce que je suis né dans la rue
Oh oui je suis né dans la rue, dans la rue, dans la rue
Dans la rue

Et bien, j'espère que ce nouveau 33 tours vous aura plu
J'espère que vous avez aimé le nouveau style de blues
Que nous avons essayé de créer pour vous
A bientôt, salut

Maintenant je ne vie plus où les murs sont toujours gris
Mon nom est en argent et ma guitare est en or

Elle voit des paysages, se raconte des histoires

Elle m'oublie, elle m'oublie, elle m'oublie

Ses cheveux blonds serrés dans un chignon mal fait
Elle pense à Dieu sait quoi, le soleil disparaît
Et la nuit va venir, le chauffeur fatigué
Cherche un vieux restaurant et elle voudra dîner

Elle m'oublie, elle m'oublie, elle m'oublie

Et moi, je vais finir cette bouteille de vin
En regardant la table, en me tordant les mains
Et moi, je vais passer la nuit dans le jardin
A compter les étoiles, ça ira mieux demain

Elle m'oublie, elle m'oublie, elle m'oublie

Demain matin, bien sûr, elle arrive à Paris
Elle retrouve les rues, ses parents, ses amis
Je lui donne trois semaines pour tomber amoureuse
Et devant son miroir, elle est déjà heureuse

Elle m'oublie, elle m'oublie, elle m'oublie

Il y a un champs de blé à faner quelque part
Le tracteur est cassé, ça fait tout une histoire

C'est tout ce que j'ai comme défense
Comprenez
Même un roi ne peut pas vivre sans ça

Tout était parfait
Toi tu as tout gâché
C'était si beau
C'était si bien

Dans mon coeur d'acier
J'ai des combats mêlés
Des cris de guerres, des villes brûlées
Des cimetières

Tout était parfait
Toi tu as tout gâché
C'était si beau
C'était si bien

Dans mon coeur d'acier
J'ai mille ans d'amour liés
À des visages, à des images
De corps pliés

Tuer mon coeur d'acier
Ne pourra rien changer
Car j'ai aimé comme tous les hommes
Et ça personne ne pourra me l'arracher

Dans mon coeur d'acier
J'ai mille ans d'amitié
Oui j'ai aimé comme tous les hommes
Et ça personne ne pourra me l'arracher

Dans mon coeur d'acier
J'ai mille ans d'amitié
Oui j'ai aimé comme tous les hommes
Et ça personne ne pourra me l'arracher

Dans mon coeur d'acier
J'ai mille ans d'amitié
Oui j'ai aimé comme tous les hommes
Et ça personne, non, ne pourra me l'arracher

Tout était parfait
Toi tu as tout gâché
C'était si beau
C'était si bien

Et l'enfer devient comme un espoir
Car dans tes mains je meurs chaque soir
Je veux partager autre chose que l'amour dans ton lit
Et entendre la vie et ne plus m'essouffler sous tes cris
Oh fini, fini pour moi
Je ne veux plus voir mon image dans tes yeux

Dix ans de chaînes sans voir le jour, c'était ma peine forçat de l'amour
Et bonne chance à celui qui veut ma place
Dix ans de chaînes sans voir le jour, c'était ma peine forçat de l'amour
J'ai refusé, mourir d'amour enchaîné

Gabrielle, tu flottes dans mon cœur, c'est une illusion de douceur
Et tu chantes, c'est la voix d'une enfant
Avec laquelle tu glaces mon sang
Je veux t'expliquer, tu confonds et le jour et la nuit
Je veux t'approcher, mais tu tournes le dos et tu t'enfuis
Oh sais-tu vraiment ce que tu veux faire?
Je ne serai plus l'esclave de ta chair

Dix ans de chaînes sans voir le jour, c'était ma peine forçat de l'amour

Tu vas lui dire les même mots qu'à moi
Vous allez faire l'amour et puis
Tu seras bien dans ton oubli
Je te dois la solitude, merci

Ton livre ouvert, lui aussi t'attend

Elle me colle au cœur, elle ne s'en va pas
Quand l'amour se meurt, elle attend déjà
Elle est presque là

Revoilà ma solitude
J'ai la tête vide et le cœur désert

Elle se lit dans mes yeux
Elle s'entend dans ma voix
Dès que tu es partie
Elle n'attendait que ça
Et la voilà

Tu vas défaire tes cheveux rien que pour lui
Tu vas lui dire les même mots qu'à moi

Où les rues étaient sombres
J'ai épousé une ombre
Sans savoir qui elle était
Du temps où je me battais
Contre des ombres

Je l'ai vue sous la pluie
Dans l'éclair de ma lame
Ses yeux étaient de flamme
Au matin de cette nuit
J'ai dit : ""Tu seras ma femme""
Elle a dit oui

Ses silences, ses absences
Sa défense, ma souffrance
Ma lame, je voudrais qu'elle entre
Qu'elle entre
Jusqu'à la garde, dans le ventre
Des hommes qu'elle regarde

Un jour sur cette terre
J'ai épousé une ombre
Une femme-mystère
Passagère et solitaire
D'où vient-elle?
Et qui est-elle?
Mais qui est-elle?

Une fille comme cette fille
Met le soleil à l'ombre
J'ai épousé une ombre
Qui me suit et qui s'évade
Prisonnière mais nomade
J'en suis malade

Ses silences, ses absences
Sa défense, ma souffrance
Je ne suis pas dans ses rêves
Et j'en crève
Je les... je les poignarde
Les hommes qu'elle regarde

Un jour sur cette terre
J'ai épousé une ombre

Johnny Hallyday,"Mon Amérique à moi, c'est une route sans feux rouges
Depuis l'Hudson River jusqu'en Californie
Et dans ma mémoire, je conserve une silhouette qui bouge
Celle d'une fille en jean entre Nashville et Bâton-Rouge
Qui marchait en rêvant près du Mississippi

Mon Amérique à moi
Mon Amérique à moi

Mon Amérique à moi, c'est jamais les gratte-ciel
Ni les flics, ni les fusils, ni la drogue, ni le sang
C'est plutôt les enfants qui sur leurs vélos rouges
Distribuent les journaux aux portes des maisons
Y a des bouteilles de lait sur tous les paillassons

Mon Amérique à moi
Mon Amérique à moi

Mon Amérique à moi, c'est un petit studio
En Floride dans la banlieue près d'Orlando
Avec trois guitares, deux batteurs, trois banjos
On avait enregistré une nouvelle version de ""Blue Suede shoes""
Sur un air paresseux et nonchalant de blues

Mon Amérique à moi
Mon Amérique à moi

Mon Amérique à moi est telle que je la rêve
Telle que je l'ai vécue, telle que vous l'avez vue
Dans les films noir et blanc, la lumière était belle
Et les figurants des westerns semblaient tout droit venus
Des albums illustrés signés Norman Rockwell

Mon Amérique à moi
Mon Amérique à moi

Mon Amérique à moi est modeste et tranquille
Elle me dit : ""Good morning !"" avec un grand sourire
Me sert du café chaud, des pommes à la vanille
M'invite pour passer Noël au Tennessee
Et pour faire du cheval dans la Ouest Virginie

Mon Amérique à moi
Mon Amérique à moi

Mon Amérique à moi, c'est toujours cette fille en jean
Je ne sais pas pourquoi elle court dans ma mémoire
Il ne s'est pourtant rien passé entre nous, pas d'histoire

J'ai traversé le feu de l'apocalypse et du néant
Là, debout sur mes pieds, je suis encore vivant

Je suis le survivant

J'ai chassé les barbares
Aux mâchoires bardées d'acier, de fer
Oui, j'ai brûlé les sauvages
Et les hommes-chiens sortant de terre

J'ai dormi dans les ruines
Perdu au cœur de l'ancienne cité
En cachant mon sang aux ombres affamées

Je suis le survivant, je suis le survivant, je suis le survivant
Je suis prêt à vivre et tuer pour survivre
Je suis le survivant, je suis le survivant, je suis le survivant

Etranglé, étouffé par les larmes froides de l'asphyxie
Oui, j'ai vécu sans amour, caché dans les bras de la folie
Poursuivi par la mort entraînant le char des condamnés
Écrasant les corps de ceux qui sont tombés

Je suis le survivant, je suis le survivant, je suis le survivant
Je suis prêt à vivre et tuer pour survivre

Tu ne fais rien tu perds ton temps
Tu ferais mieux de travailler
Au lieu de t'en aller traîner

Han han han, laisse les filles
Han han han, oui, laisse les filles
Tu as bien le temps
D'avoir des milliers d'embêtements crois-moi
Oui laisse donc un peu les filles

J'ai beau penser à ses conseils
A la fenêtre je m'émerveille
Et je regarde passer ces demoiselles
Pendant que ma mère crie de plus belle :

Han han han, laisse les filles
Han han han, oui, laisse les filles
Tu as bien le temps
D'avoir des milliers d'embêtements crois-moi
Oui laisse donc un peu les filles

Avec Claude hier au soir
Devant le juke-box près du bar
On dansait, y avait de la gaieté
Lorsque ma mère s'est radinée

Han han han, laisse les filles
Han han han, oui, laisse les filles
Tu as bien le temps
D'avoir des milliers d'embêtements crois-moi
Oui laisse donc un peu les filles

Heureusement pauv' de moi
Pour me soutenir j'ai mon papa
Qui me dit toujours : vas-y mon gars
Puisque les filles c'est fait pour ça

Han, han, han
Laisse les filles t'adorer, oui
Laisse les filles
Te câliner te caresser te cajoler

Oui laisse-toi aimer des filles

Où le soleil semblait rire

Qu´un peu d´espoir
Mais nous partions comme Gavroche
Le cœur assez bavard

Ne battrait jamais pour aucun autre cœur

Et j'avais longtemps, longtemps voyagé
J'avais des cendres dans la bouche
Et je me sentais fatigué

Si blonds, si clairs, si transparents
Me redonnèrent cette fraîcheur
Que connaissent seuls les enfants

Je suis descendu sur le quai
Elle m'a fait visiter sa ville
Et marcher dans des champs de blé

Près d'un fleuve sauvage et rapide
Nous avons ensemble dormi
Et je crois bien l'avoir aimée
Au bout de la première nuit

Si vous prenez parfois le train
Surveillez les quais désertés

Though we're apart, you're part of me still

For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill.

Marchant dans la ville inerte
J'allais dans les rues désertes

Mon cœur bat si fort
Que j'en tremble encore
J'étais seul parmi les morts

Des passants au regard vide
Au teint de plâtre livide
Pétrifiés semblaient attendre
Et soudain on vit descendre

La nuit en plein jour
Du ciel un discours
Les gens criaient, ""Au secours""

Moi j'ai fait un mauvais rêve
Avec la nuit qui s'achève
Les murs tombaient en poussière
Et j'ai dit une prière

Et dans le néant

Dans leur néant

Johnny Hallyday,"Une musique est née dans la rue
Nos quinze ans libérés se sont jetés dessus
Des guitares en acier rythment la liberté
Une bombe a explosé

Ouh, le rock'n'roll est né
Les enfants se sont réveillés
Quand la musique devient sauvage
Fini le temps des enfants sages

Le rock'n'roll est né
Les enfants se sont réveillés
La musique change de visage
Et l'on déchire les images

Blousons de cuir sous un réverbère
Frappent des mains et tombent les genoux à terre
Elvis, ça se chante en secouant les cheveux
Brillantine dans les yeux

Ouh, le rock'n'roll est né
Les enfants se sont réveillés
Quand la musique devient sauvage
Fini le temps des enfants sages

Le rock'n'roll est né
Les enfants se sont réveillés
La musique change de visage
Et l'on déchire les images

On va le jouer sous les chapiteaux
""C'est un raz-de-marée,"" racontent les journaux
""C'est rythme païen,"" racontent les curetons
On change de religion

Ouh, le rock'n'roll est né
Les enfants se sont réveillés
Quand la musique devient sauvage
Fini le temps des enfants sages

Le rock'n'roll est né
Les enfants se sont réveillés
La musique change de visage
Et l'on déchire les images

Le rock'n'roll est né

Johnny Hallyday,"Mes yeux sont fous
Ou mes yeux sont fous
Ou là, devant moi
C'est la fille que j'aime

Et, dans ses bras, c'est mon meilleur ami
Mais non, je ne peux croire ça

Ça me ferait trop mal
Elle ne ferait pas ça
Ça me ferait trop mal
Elle ne dirait pas ça, pas ça

Mon amour, mon amour, mon amour
Ou mes yeux sont fous
Ou la vie me joue un tour
Mais pourquoi me faire ça

Je veux si peu
Je demandais qu'elle m'aime un peu
Mais c'était beaucoup
Leurs lèvres qui se cherchent

Ça me ferait trop mal
Et ces mots qu'elle lui crie
Ça me ferait trop mal, trop mal
Mon amour, mon amour, mon amour

Cet ami qui trahit
Ça me ferait trop mal
Cette fille qui m'oublie
Ça me ferait trop mal

Mes yeux sont fous

Ce n'est pas vrai

Johnny Hallyday,"Ton ombre elle est là dans le fond de ma chambre
Seul à rêver de toi par un soir de décembre
Je te revois et puis tu disparais
Et par mes pleurs ton visage est mouillé

C'est mon imagination qui vient me jouer un tour
C'est mon imagination car je suis fou d'amour

J'essaie d'oublier jusqu'au son de ta voix
Effacer à jamais mon souvenir de toi
Je te revois et puis tu disparais
Et par mes pleurs ton visage est mouillé

C'est mon imagination qui vient me jouer un tour
C'est mon imagination car je suis fou d'amour

Comme un mirage ton image elle est bien là
Dans mon imagination je vois
Comme un mirage ton image toujours là
Dans mon imagination, pourquoi

Ton départ je ne m'y ferai jamais
Y a-t-il un espoir qu'on puisse un jour recommencer
Je te revois et puis tu disparais
Et par mes pleurs ton visage est brouillé

J'ai bien du mal
À croire à ton amour

She's sure fine lookin' man
She's somethin' else

Hey look-ah there
Across the street
There's a car made just for me
To own that car would be a luxury
But right now I can't afford the gas
A brand new convertible is out of my class
But that can't stop me from-ah thinkin' to myself 
That car's fine lookin' man
It's somethin' else

Hey look-ah here
Just wait and see
Workin' hard and savin' my dough
I'll buy that car that I've be wanting so 
Get me that girl and we'll go ridin' around
The town will be all shocked with my white top down
I'll keep right on and dreamin' and-ah thinkin' to myself 
When it all comes true, man
Wow! That's somethin' else

Look-ah here
What's all this?
Never thought I'd do this before

Johnny Hallyday,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

And got so far

elle veut ma vie, tout

Jusqu'au fond
Je sais qu'elle m'emmène

Le chemin du désir au désastre

Elle veut ma vie, tout
Tout ce qu'il en reste
Pas les mots, elle veut les gestes
Elle veut ma vie, tout
tout pour son plaisir
Sur le dos, mon dernier soupir

Qu'à prier tant qu'on est à genoux
Mais sitôt sa main sur la mienne
Le seul mot que je connaisse c'est amen

Johnny Hallyday,"Parc'qu'ils sont au seuil de la vie
Et parce que tout, tout leur sourit
Les jeunes parfois font du chahut
Ils se bousculent dans la rue
Mais je vous le dis simplement
Ce n'est pas méchant

S'ils portent les cheveux un peu longs
Des blue jeans et même des blousons
C'est qu'ils en pincent pour cette tenue
Et c'est mieux que d'marcher nu
Aussi je le dis simplement
Ce n'est pas méchant

Parmi les gens plus âgés
Qui leur donnent tort
Il en est en vérité
Qui font bien plus fort
Et on se demande à les voir parfois
Faire la nouba
Si les jeunes c'est bien ce que l'on croit

On peut les voir quand vient l'printemps
À trois ou quatre c'est amusant
Sur une moto d'un demi-cheval
Qui fait un bruit infernal
Mais entre nous sincèrement
Ce n'est pas méchant

Parce qu'ils claquent des doigts en chantant
On dit que les jeunes sont fatigants
Oui oui oui et dans les machines à sous
Qui dansent et font les p'tits fous
Entre nous j'l'avoue franchement
Ce n'est pas méchant

Parfois à la belle saison
Filles et garçons
Sans s'occuper des passants
S'embrassent sur un banc
Alors on se met à les critiquer
C'est insensé
Puisque l'amour n'est pas un péché

Parce qu'ils ne sont pas encore mûrs
Aux joies, aux peines de la nature
Oui oui oui pardonnez-leur ces petits défauts
Ils ne sont pas bien bien gros
Mais au fond tout ça vraiment
Ce n'est pas méchant

Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

But baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Johnny Hallyday,"J'ai rêvé la nuit dernière
Que je me baladais dans les champs
Le ciel était couleur argent
Je crois qu'il y avait une rivière

J'suis entré dans une forêt
C'était joli, les peupliers
Quelque part, une feuille est tombée

Et Sammy m'a secoué
Parce que j'ronflais
Plus de peupliers
Mercredi, mes gosses vont m'visiter
Mais faut avoir la santé
Enfin, façon de parler

Parfois j'me joue le coup du tunnel
La lime à ongles, cent mètres, ça presse
Mais j'suis con en Edmond Dantès
Et ma fille de l'air bat de l'aile

Alors j'me jette sur des pages blanches
Un best-seller de la souffrance
Du croustillant, de la violence

Et puis j' m'en fous d'écrire
Sammy sait pas lire
Plus scribouiller
Mercredi, on va voir la télé
Mais faut avoir la santé
Enfin, façon de parler

Ici, y a des questions à ne jamais poser
Du genre ""Sammy, qu'est-ce qu'on fait aujourd'hui ?""

Ici, y a des parfums à ne pas se rappeler
""Sammy, si t'avais vu son sourire""

Ici, y a certains mots à ne pas prononcer
""Sammy, je me ferais bien un café-calva
Dans un certain café-tabac
Au coin de la Rue des Martyrs""

J'ai rêvé la nuit dernière
Qu'elle dormait contre mon épaule
Complètement nue, elle était drôle
Appliquée comme une prière
J'ai posé mes mains sur son cou
Je voulais que le temps s'arrête

J'ai serré, un peu trop peut-être
Et Sammy gentiment m'a réveillé
C'est terminé
Mercredi qui dure trente années
Faut avoir la santé
Enfin, façon de parler",Mercredi Matin

Johnny Hallyday,"Il y a dans le cœur de tout homme
Un chasseur d'histoires qui sommeille
Un instinct fort qui vous assomme
Vous prend de force et vous réveille

Je n'suis jamais resté en place
Besoin de voir d'autres visages
Chanter sous le feu et la glace
Vivre toujours sur un nuage

Mais chaque soir par la pensée
Je prends ta main jusqu'à te voir
Et je vois nos deux corps danser
Coulant de sueur dans le noir

Demain pourtant
Je reviendrai dans tes bras
Avec de l'amour plein les mains
Je reviendrai dans tes bras
Parce que c'est là que je suis bien

Je reviendrai dans tes bras
Avec de l'amour plein les mains
Je reviendrai dans tes bras
Je reviendrai car je suis moi

J'ai toujours la gorge serrée
Après avoir longtemps chanté
L'impression d'avoir tout donné
Ça vous fout l'blues jusqu'à pleurer

Et je me couche comme un enfant
Sans dormir, juste à me maudire
J'ai trop souvent frôlé le pire
Demain je viens sans faire semblant

Oui demain enfin
Je reviendrai dans tes bras
Avec de l'amour plein les mains
Je reviendrai dans tes bras
Parce que c'est là que je suis bien

Carry it home and cook it for supper

Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang

And pick her a mess of polk salad, and carry it home in a tow sack

Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(A wretched, spiteful, straight-razor totin' woman

Johnny Hallyday,"On est pas là pour payer les dettes
On a tous connus nos martyres
On se contente de chaque miette,
De chaque seconde, de chaque soupir

Il n´y a pas grand-chose que l´on regrette
Ou l´on ne veut plus se souvenir
On a bravé tant de tempêtes
Qu´on ne s´est même pas vus grandir

Dis-moi que la vie est encore plus belle
Quand on a plus 20 ans
Est-ce qu´on peut encore toucher le ciel
Quand on a plus 20 ans
Donnes-moi des monts et des merveilles
Comme si j´avais 20 ans
Est-ce qu´on peut t´appeler mademoiselle
Tu as toujours 20 ans

On joue toujours avec les allumettes
Avec les flammes, avec le désir
On a qu´une envie, qu´une requête
De rire conne si on n´allait jamais mourir
On a passé l´âge d´être bête
Pas celui de se faire éblouir
Chaque journée est une conquête
Qu´il faut abattre d´un sourire

Dis-moi que la vie est encore plus belle
Quand on a plus 20 ans
Est-ce qu´on peut encore toucher le ciel
Quand on plus 20 ans
Donne-moi des monts et des merveilles
Comme si j´avais 20 ans
Est-ce qu´on peut t´appeler mademoiselle
Tu as toujours 20 ans
Toujours 20 ans, an an an, an an an
Toujours 20 ans, an an an,an an an

On est venus à bout de le bête
Et des nuits qui devaient rétrécir
On ne battra jamais en retraite
On a encore tant de choses à offrir",20 Ans
Johnny Hallyday,"Devant les autres je joue ma vie
Pour devenir ce que je suis
Devant les autres je gagne et je perds
Je le vois dans leurs yeux de l´ombre à la lumière, je me remets en jeu
Devant toi mils feux, des montagnes de fers ne sont plus que poussière
Devant toi je ne joue plus
Je dépose les armes et tous les drapeaux
Je ne joue plus comme un enfant devant les cris et les bravos
Je ne joue plus
Entre tes mains, je remets ma vie
Jusqu´à laissé mon cœur à nu
Quant il est là, quant il est venu
Tes yeux sont le miroir ou je me reconnais
Tel que tu m´attendais
Quand tu reviens me voir, quand je reviens te voir ou rien ne meurs jamais
Devant toi je ne joue plus
Je dépose les armes et tous les drapeaux
Je ne joue plus comme un enfant devant les cris et les bravos
Je ne joue plus
Je pris pour que tu lises en moi un livre ouvert
Pour toi je dis à quoi je sers
Devant toi je ne joue plus

And fill them 'til they overflow, with rose and cherry red
And should this sunlit world, grow dark one day
The colors of my life will leave a shining light to show the way

The colors of my life, are softer than a breeze
The silver gray of [Incomprehensible] the dappled green of trees
Amber of a wheat field, hazel of a seed
Crystal of a raindrop are all I'll ever need

Your reds are much too bold, in gold I find no worth
I fill my days with [Incomprehensible] brown, the colors of the earth
And if from by my side my love should roam
The colors of my life will shine a quiet light to lead her home

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you

Our rendezvous, Mam'selle
The violins were warm and sweet 
And so were you, Mam'selle

I don't remember growing older,

When did she get to be a beauty?
When did he grow to be so tall?

Seedlings turn overnight to sunflowers,
Blossoming even as we gaze.

Laden with happiness and tears.

What words of wisdom can I give them?
How can I help to ease their way?
Now they must learn from one another,
Day by day.
They look so natural together,

Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings

Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs

I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?
I'm happy when I'm with you

Sunbeams now there will be in the skies
Tell me that you will be true

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Since the puritans got a shock
When they landed on Plymouth rock
If today any shock they might try to stem

In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
But now God knows

Good authors to
Who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words
Writing prose

If driving fast cars you like
If low bars you like
If old hymns you like
If bare limbs you like
If Mae West you like
Or me undressed you like
Why nobody will oppose

When every night
The set that's smart
Is intruding on nudist parties
In studios
Anything goes

When Mrs. Ned McClean God bless her
Can get Russian reds to yes her
Than I suppose
Anything goes

When Rockerfeller still can hoard
Enough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows
Anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today
And black's white today
And days night today
And that gent today
You gave a cent today
Once owned several ch'teaux

When folks
Who still can ride in Jitney's
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitney's
Lack baby clo'es

When Sam Goldwyn
Can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction
Than Anna shows

When you hear that
Lady Mendl standing up
Now turns a handspring landing up
On her toes

And those knocks you've got
And those blues you've got
From those news you've got
And those pains you've got

There's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to minor,

In my pet pailletted gown
Down in the depths on the ninetieth floor
While the crowds at El Morocco punish the parquet
And at '21' the couples clamor for more
I'm deserted and depressed
In my regal eagle nest
Down in the depths on the ninetieth floor
When the only one you wanted wants another
What's the use of swank and cash in the bank galore?
Why, even the janitor's wife
Has a perfectly good love life
And here am I
Facing tomorrow
Alone with my sorrow
Down in the depths on the ninetieth floor.",Down in the Depths

A game I thought I'd never play
""Romance is a game for fools""
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ahh, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in
Open up your heart and let this fool rush in!!",Fools Rush In

Aflame with such a burning desire that only your kiss can put out the fire.

Out yonder where the blue begins

Over the rim of the hill?

The more I see you, 
The more I want you

The decks are trimmed with gold
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold

And rubies fill each bin

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring

They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

I only know they tell me that love is grand, and

Is wonderful, wonderful

The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrific'ly too
Yet I get a kick out of you

I get a kick ev'ry time I see
You're standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously do not adore me

I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some gal/guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
But I get a kick out of you",I Get a Kick out of You
Johnny Hartman,"On a clear day, rise and look around you
And you'll see who you are
On a clear day how it will astound you
That the glow of your being outshines every star

You'll feel part of ev'ry mountain, sea, and shore
You can hear from far and near a world you've never heard before

And on a clear day, on that clear day
You can see forever and ever more

You can hear from far and near a world you've never heard before

And on that clear day, on that clear day
You can see forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and evermore!",On a Clear Day
Johnny Hates Jazz,"There is a face deep in your mind
One that your heart won't leave behind
Memories are cold-empty of laughs
And all that remains are photographs

When she's gone there are no reasons
Nature's cruel - it's just different seasons
Going on and on

There is a voice deep in your soul
Telling you not to lose control
And day after day you hold back the tears
'Cos pain is the greatest of your fears

When she's gone there are no reasons
Nature's cruel - it's just different seasons
Going on and on

There are no reasons
Say it's only different seasons",Different Seasons
Johnny Hates Jazz,"The minutes are slipping away
As we say our last good bye
Bid the world a fond farewell
We'll share in a final begin to fade
It's a tale they had to tell

I'm wiping the tears from your face
Though I can't control myself
God have mercy on us all
The chapter has ended a story
That only just begun
First the rise and then the fall

(Chorus)
But don't let it end this way
Before you can go
There's something that I must say
Don't let it end this way
It's too late to cry
When winter has come to stay

I once had a book in my hand
That I didn't understand
Now I witness every page
So won't you come closer my love
Now our time has nearly come
Take a bow and leave the stage

Don't let the change
We've never needed answers
To find the way

Now all of a sudden
Like waves on a beach
Love has come crashing down
The truth has been lost and found

(Chorus)
Don't say it's love, baby
'Cos you are to me
What you want to be
Don't say it's love, baby
If our friendship is to survive
Don't say it's love

We've shared so many secrets
Now kiss and tell
You make one move to love me
And it's farewell

'Cos somewhere there's someone
Who's waiting for you
To love you more than I could
Your heart was misunderstood

(Chorus)

Don't be a fool
You'll be alone in your confusion
If loving me is an illusion
Then let it go
Oh no no no no

Now I never counted
On ending this way
I always trusted fate
But if we are no too late

The stars that shine

My ivory moon

The wind that calls
The stars will shine
And I will come
And you will say

This is enough
Of me and my foolish heart
My foolish heart

Oh you will take my hand
And we will wander far away
Oh you will take my hand
And I will follow

Down where the walls come crashing
Down where the proudest fall
Down where those fools come rushing in
To where they fell before

Down where the age has passed me

You will be there and I will belong
To me and my foolish heart

For a murder I will not commit?

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

How can we resist these'n that'n those

Down there among the fields of cotton,
Down where the folks have not forgotten me
I feel blue just for a little girl I'm strong for,
Just for a certain one I long to see.
I'm goin' down aroun' my ALABAMY HOME
I'm gonna see the bee that makes the honey comb
The brindle cow will wag her tail,
As I fill up the pail I'll chase the flies and
I surmise she'll moo, ""Thanks to you.
""I'll feed the chicks, and mix some barley with their corn
They love it so, I know they'll cluck for luck each morn
Then I will lie amid the hay
And call it all a day

Johnny Hodges,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning

I let you

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing

I'm so lonely

I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there

It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel a power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,

On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?

How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

Johnny Holiday,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You
