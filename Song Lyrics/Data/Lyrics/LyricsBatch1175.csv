Soilwork,"Lost
It's been a long time
For this moment to come
Lost
It's been a long line
Where I've been waiting too long
Where I've been waiting too long

All those words and the consequences
Won't you please shed some light
All the fear and all that joy
Guide my way as I turn in desire

[Chorus]
How it hurts when I give up
The way that it ends
Twist and turn 'til it erupts
The way it commands

Lost
It's been a long fight
And it kept holding on
Lost
It's been a long sigh
It has been clearing my mind!

All those years being overloaded
All the strength I put in
Let me share what I've done to myself
I've been losing to win

[Chorus] 

How it hurts when I give up
You don't understand
Twist and turn, the way it looks
Into my eyes again

[Chorus]

How it hurts when I give up
You don't understand
Twist and turn, the way it looks
The way it commands

The way it commands",Epitome
Soilwork,"Choking on nothing
Hands turning cold
The deeper the mind goes
The deeper the hole

I'm reaching a point where
No one else goes
My fate seems to be split in half
Can't control it at all

Words turn to ashes
Comfort won't help
Pointless to reach out
I'm losing myself
All I know is I wish this could end
Get rid of this feeling and stop to pretend

[Chorus]
(Let me)
Try to understand as I've
(Failed to be)
Someone I'm not
(It's so real)
I've been fooled once again
I've been 
Forced to feel


It's like I'm not present
It's like I'm not here
A voice calls with vengeance
I am lost with the fear

Searching for meaning, searching within
The lust that was broken, has vanished again
Feels like a set up with no one to trust
The pictures I'm seeing won't leave 'til they're loved

[Chorus]

And now I wonder what's become of me
Is it the truth that was found?
Whatever it is, I won't respect the sound 
Of giving things up

(Choking on nothing)
(Hands turning cold)
The deeper the mind goes
The deeper the hole

I'm reaching a point where
No one else goes
My fate seems to be split in half
Can't control it at all

[Chorus]

So let me
So let me
So let me
So let me!

Fuck it all",King of the Threshold
Soilwork,"Consider me dead if that's what you want
Gather around me, the day has come

Straight through the threshold
The morning calls
Wasn't meant to be there
When I opened the door
You saw me begging
You saw me down on my knees
I felt defenseless
And you don't know how it feels

I have made up my mind every time
It's been dragged in the dirt
Every scar wears a thought
Leaving battles that I've loved
It's been hard, it's been fiercely infected
It's been dropped, it's been suddenly present
Cutting ways that I've walked
Earning miles through it all

[Chorus]
I was late for the kill, but early for the slaughter
I don't care how it bleeds
I was late for the kill but stopped in to drag the waters
Turn the bitter to sleep

I do believe there's something more
Though my vision's blurred
Straight out of nowhere
With the lack of words
I've been given the time
I've been given the faith
Don't you try to stop me
Don't you lie to my face

I have made up my mind everytime
It's been dragged in the dirt
Every word feeds the crown
To dictate the profound
It's been hard, it's been fiercely infected
It's been dropped, it's been suddenly present
Cutting ways that I've walked
Earning miles through it all

Through it all!

[Chorus] 

Just hear me out on this one
Cause I ain't got nothing to hide
I will wipe out this mess
And return to life

Consider me dead if that's what you want
Gather around me, the day is done

Late for the kill
Early for the slaughter
(I don't care how it bleeds)
Late for the kill
Stopped in to drag the waters
(Turn the bitter to sleep)","Late for the Kill, Early for the Slaughter"
Soilwork,"Once I lost it
It took hold of me
Once again
Lost and left to see
What was there
Wouldn't let me be
Spoiled with misery
Spoiled with energy

[Chorus]
(Let me be that one)
Who will rise and return from sleep
(Give me strength to run)
Become one with the remedy
No regrets, no compromise
Story will be told
Won't reject the cure this time
Let this river flow

Let this river flow
Let this river flow

As the river meets the sea
That's when the ghost
Becomes my belief
Will it wash up?
Serve in need?
Bring the harvest
Without greed

Bring the harvest
Without greed
Bring the harvest
Let me feel
One for the core
One for the mind
One by one
Make me run

[Chorus] 

Ah, let this river flow

I will rise up
I will rise up
I will rise up
Once again 
Once again 

I will rise!
I will rise again!
I will rise again!

So clear to me yesterday
So clear once for all
It was there almost watching me
Became one with the fall
What if the best of me
Will say that I won't recall
If those empty witnesses
Won't say nothing at all

No regrets, no compromise
Story will be told
Won't reject the cure this time
Let this river flow

Let this river flow
Let this river flow",Let This River Flow
Soilwork,"Let me tell you about a soul who loves disaster
The night comes clean and then he dreams of going faster
He deals with angels one on one and gets his hopes up
It runs so deep, it runs so deep

[Chorus]
Changes
Won't you tell me why it's changing
(It breaks my heart each time)
Changes
Won't you tell me why it's changing
It breaks my heart each time when it dies
The desire we will fight
Is tearing through my veins
We're exploiting our fears
Bringing fire to tears, I am lost


He fights the anguish and he overcomes the madness
See angels fall and now the demons are his masters
With broken heart he turns away from all the sadness
It runs so deep, it runs so deep...

Changes
Won't you tell me why it's changing
(It breaks my heart each time)

Changes
Won't you tell me why it's changing
It breaks my heart each time
When it dies

The desire we will fight
It's burning in my veins
We're exploiting our fears
Bringing fire to tears, I am lost
[Altered Chorus]

Turn your back on me
Does it have to be? 
Does it have to be? 

Turn your back on me
Like the ones I've lost, opened up my insanity
Does it have to be
Such an endless story that keeps on breaking me

I'm gonna reach out
I'm gonna take back what I once had
It's like I blacked out
No more deceit, no more regrets

Changes
Won't you tell me why it's changing

Soilwork,"I can feel how it's calling me
I can feel how it hurts
Like the words to a silent sleep
As the beating gets worse

I face the fact once I roll the dice
Pretend to feel when my luck is burnt
Sick of fighting and confronting the lies
Won't the wind finally turn?

All being
Selfish lies
Won't change
The warning sign
Can I
Make my way
If I
Turn away

I've learned to trust the fall
I've learned to see through all
When the pair is out of time
I'll be there at the end of the line

Sweet demise
Always out of time
Sweet demise
Through the threshold

Fear denied
Always out of time
Sent to die
Born to defy

I don't care who's wrong or right
'Cause I had my share
It doesn't matter if it's out of sight
When no one else gives a damn

Sick of fighting and confronting the lies
Won't the wind finally turn?

Soilwork,"Watch me now!

Gave in for the moment
A lifetime of thrills
Paid up to deserve it
Made up with my pills
(Now will you ever learn!)
And make it all just turn

An ironic pattern
A foolish will
A sweet reputation
A passion to kill
(Falling down again!)
And feel the core getting chilled

How it lies, a twisted device
Giving you up ten times
Stop the search and you will find

And dismantle the thrill!

Hunting for closure
(But) the story goes on
A cancer that bleeds
Won't leave 'til you're done
(Like streams of broken glass!)
Passing through your veins

Obsessed with obsession
Corroded from guilt
Such a drag of progression
The tears getting spilled
(Now will you ever learn!)
And make it all just turn

How it lies, a twisted device
Giving you up ten times
Stop the search and you will find

How it lies, a twisted device
Filling you up to deny
Stop the search and you will find

I'm playing alone and will master
Talking to myself and will find out
I'm playing alone and will master
Talking to myself

I'm playing alone and will master
Talking to myself and will find out
How to retain ever after
The pain, the sound, the bottomless game I was taught

How it lies, a twisted device
Giving you up ten times
Stop the search and you will find

How it lies, a twisted device
Filling you up to deny
Stop the search and you will find

And dismantle the thrill!",The Thrill
Soilwork,"It's just the way it starts
The way it feels
Submissioned while trying to find the lead
One thing to another
The way it goes
The plans you were making are turning cold
One by one, they set your fall
So distinguished yet having to go through it all
Forged into something that wasn't meant...
To be in the shadow of make believe!

Round two
You're trying to make me
Bound to
The circle within me

[Chorus]
I gave it away
And now I am so tired
There's nothing more left to fight
I'll be learning to change
(Two lives worth of reckoning)
It hurts to be blind
And how i've been fading lights
I've been crawling to pick my side
And it left me deranged
(From the reckoning)

It's just the way I need
To plant that seed
Won't settle for nothing
Won't settle with greed
All I'm asking for
Is to reach the point
Where I won't dwell
On resentful times

Round two
You're trying to make me
Bound to
The circle within me

Oooh, right!

[Chorus]

(When I see that graceful day)
The hours remain
From the scar to the threshold
(It will be the greatest slay)
The forced mind will turn
Won't stick or burn
(I'm holding on, it goes deep within)
Releasing the guilt
Please encourage my will
(It will be the sweetest release)
The struggle makes free
And the air I would breathe!

[Chorus]",Two Lives Worth of Reckoning
Soilwork,"Who cares but sorrow
When you're down and close to nothing
No one will bother
Watching antidotes in passing

I'm left without a cause
Believe me
They never told me why
I'm grieving
Now where is the light?

Outside the world goes on
It keeps on turning
The feeling of being an outcast
Just keeps growing

There must be life there must be light
Take me home, where the truth unfolds
And steals away the night

Distance keeps growing
Soon I'm far enough to lose it
Am I deserving
'Cause I was brave enough to use it?

I'm left without a cause
Believe me
They never told me why
I'm grieving
Now where is the light?

Outside the world goes on
It keeps on turning

Just keeps growing

There must life.. there must be light

Soilwork,"Need for attention
Need for solace
In this abuse ridden world
I've fallen into oblivion with you
A mental hand shake of fools

This life has gotten us all
The paradox still remains
We live to choke the difference
Carry the weight of an awful fate
That's what they told you to do

Nothing's changed
Nothing will
We still live the other truth
It makes us cope
With our need for violence
Nothing's changed
Nothing will
We still give
The water's still
But it still drowns our wish
With silence

I can laugh in the face of God
Cause I won't be loved in the end
Look at all of the pain that I've felt
The truth that I've bent to accommodate myself
A sideshow with misery
An affair with no dignity
I've lost myself, I've lost myself

The surface's fading, all structures collapse as my blood turns pitch black.

Three choices: escape, stand guard or give in.
Three choices: escape, stand guard or give in.

I could feel it, the presence of an entity.
A calling, a cry for help.
Burning insects to get through the mist.

Three choices: escape, stand guard or give in.

We're the first, we're the generation
We are the ones to be one, this nation starts with us
it doesn't end when the water does

remember birth and give away the numbness
Mankind was built on conquest
NOW'S the time that you give away the unrest
Unless we can undress all of the past concepts
and practice a little oneness
our future generations are just suspect
subject to our bullshit

Let it out and if it's true, it will flow out of you
It's like a river in your mind

Sojourn,"My child arrived just the other day
Came into the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin’ ‘fore I knew it, and as he grew
He’d say “I’m gonna be like you, Dad
You know I’m gonna be like you.”

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, Dad?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, son
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

My son turned ten just the other day
He said, “Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let’s play
Can you teach me to throw?” I said, “Not today
I got a lot to do”, he said, “That’s ok.”
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
And said, “I’m gonna be like him, yeah.
You know I’m gonna be like him.”

And the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, Dad?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, son
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
“Son, I’m proud of you. Can you sit for a while?”
He shook his head and said with a smile,
“What I’d really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later. Can I have them please?”

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, son?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, Dad
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

Well, I’ve long since retired; my son’s moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, “I’d like to see you if you don’t mind.”
He said, “I’d love to, Dad, if I can find the time.
You see, my new job’s a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it’s sure nice talking to you, Dad.
It’s been sure nice talking to you.”

And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He’d grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon

In love with you
(In love with you)

Close your eyes and move
Please don't think just groove
Please, do that for me
Let them know you're my baby

Speechless, enchanted
When I see you baby
Reach less romantic
Just keep dancing baby

When you move like that I could just fall
In love with you
(In love with you)

Ooh, keep climbing
Make your mark in here
Your eyes keep shining
Though its dark in here

And when you move like that I could just fall
In love with you
(In love with you)

Close your eyes and move
Please don't think just groove
Please, do that for me
Let them know you're my baby

It's weird I know
But somehow I know
I've been handed you
You've been handed me

It's like some fantasy
I like you
I want you
Dance with me forever and ever

You're undecided
You wanna mingle more
Your face just brightens
When you think of me as yours

And when you smile like that I can just fall
In love with you
(In love with you)

Seems like the world
Suspects something baby
They should pinch themselves
'Cause they ain't dreamin' baby

And when we get like that
The whole world could just fall
In love too
(In love too)

Close your eyes and move
Please don't think just groove
Please, do that for me
Let them know, you're my baby

Solange,"There is this guy that I'm diggin'
What I've been lookin' for
Don't know where to begin
We've been talkin', not enough

But when we do talk the things that he says
I do love when I see him and we talk
There is this vibe between us, I don't wanna stop
So original and so deep, this guy is just like me

Hey, uh, let's try something
Let's try to be together
Maybe wrong choice of words
I just want time together

Who knows, maybe we will
We'll really like each other
Give me a chance
Maybe I'll change your mind forever

I think you need someone
Like me to help you to
Clear your mind way off stress
And that's what I will do

With my laughter
Smile, crazy thoughts
Who'd never knew
That I'd end up really feelin' you

He told me I was beautiful
But what if he tells that to every girl he talks to
'Cause I'm not the only
But actually wish that I could be

He's what I've been lookin' for
Like no other guy that I know
Because he is so right
I swear I think about him from morning 'til night

Hey, uh, let's try something
Let's try to be together
Maybe wrong choice of words
I just want time together

Who knows, maybe we will
We'll really like each other
Give me a chance
Maybe I'll change your mind forever

I think you need someone
Like me to help you to
Clear your mind way off stress
And that's what I will do

With my laughter
Smile, crazy thoughts
Who'd never knew
That I'd end up really feelin' you

He's got this hypnotizing smile
That makes me stop and realize he's good looking
But that is not what attracted me, tacted me
So fabulously matched me to him

It was his style and persona
How he does what he does
His whole walk
How he talks is true

So maybe we should and we could
Put all things aside
Spend some time
'Cause I'm feelin' you

Hey, uh, let's try something
Let's try to be together
Maybe wrong choice of words
I just want time together

Who knows, maybe we will
We'll really like each other
Give me a chance
Maybe I'll change your mind forever

I think you need someone
Like me to help you to
Clear your mind way off stress
And that's what I will do

With my laughter
Smile, crazy thoughts
Who'd never knew
That I'd end up really feelin' you

There is this guy that I'm diggin'
(That I'd end up really feelin' you)
There is this guy that I'm diggin'
(That I'd end up really feelin' you)

Solange,"I still remember the first time I met you
A nice December night I went to
A lil' party with my girl 'cause she
Told me we'd have a good time but not expected 
To get to met the one I see over and over in my dreams
That would be you my use to be baby
I use to think of you as the only one for me

I use to think of you 
More than anythin' else in this world
You use to tell me no one else could ever fit
In the place your girl
But me, it use to kill me not to see your face
I use to, now that's all I can say 
Is I use to baby

Sittin' in my bed just lettin' my head
Go through all the great times we shared
Go to the movies and so frequently 
Just wanted to be ion your arms
Remember the time when you gave me the bear
With the message that I was always on your mind
Am I on your mind? right now
Is that how you felt at the time
Is the how you use to feel

I use to think of you 
More than anythin' else in this world
You use to tell me no one else could ever fit
In the place your girl
But me, it use to kill me not to see your face
I use to, now that's all I can say 
Is I use to baby

All those words that you said
Do they mean anythin' now
That you'd always be there
Your not here so how could
It be true all I can say is I use to

Sky, Sky Away...

I'm so silly thinking of my life (peaceful with you)
No one ever made me feel the way (that I do with you with you).
Still, even so I've got so much to learn (About Love)
But if what I felt with you is not (Then what was?)
Whenever I was in your arms (I was filled with joy)
And no one else could tell me you weren't mine (and I wasn't yours) 
The look upon my face couldn't express (my feelings baby)
No words could leave my mouth to explain (just Sky away)

[Chorus]
I close my eyes,
My heart flies,
My soul lies,
Another Day, I sky away
Into the clouds,
Butterflies,
Where sun rises happen all day, 
I sky away.

Whatever happened to the love we gave? (With me and you)
When everyone insisted that I love (Wasn't even true)
We tried so hard to make sure that we proved (We proved 'em wrong)
But now all that has changed And I am here (While you are gone)

I miss the days, miles away, on the phone (Wishing you were there)
And all the wonderful things that you said (Let me know you care)
I miss the nights we spent, all the moments, (No one can take)
But most of all, I miss just being with you (SKY AWAY)

[Chorus]

Stars and rainbows light up the way
All the spoken words that one can say
Unicorns laugh as we lay
In the field of the reality
Hand and hand we walk, as you'll say
How much you miss me and you care for me
Baby, I'm praying that someday
I'll close my eyes and you'll be there to sky away

Remember every dream that kept you in your sleep,

Soon it all becomes a part of you.

Remember who you are,

And tell me we're in danger

But I know if I got one thing

You keep me sheltered through the six o'clock blues 
Yeah, you keep me sheltered 
Through the six o'clock

Can bring you to me
Just given me the only warmth to feel
Can we lay in this space until forever?
Till the moments around us all are still

To the hills where the love people go
Far in the night you and I don't look back you will find me

And I love you I swear
Cosmic journey
And I love you I swear 

Won't you go deeper than deep can dig into me
Make the words roll over your tongue to mine
As I probably kiss you better than I'll tell you
And the way that you touch feel so sublime 

Be all mine
And discover you in as you will find
Far into the night you and I don't look back and you'll find me

Welcome to Solange
And I had wished you dreams

Get me, get me out of this box
I feel so claustrophobic in here
Leave your labels, leave with no patience
Hear my voice and fill with your ears
I'm no soul, girl, equipped with no afro

I'm not her and never will be

And my physical exhibit doesn't represent me well

I wanna know where we going
I'm right beside you 07 

Street lights twilights
There's a liquor store
By his playground
It's raining a cash flow
But it sits well at home
It's a hustle
Now a mother use to hustle
To a different tune
There's a midnight thrilling
And oh the traffic's heavy burning light
Don't slow you down

Don't let me fall victim to this human nature
I know the way it is don't mean that's how its suppose
To be, oh I wonder where this broken
Place is going to take us, and where the
Way I want to know. 

Street life crowded
That's his way out the illusion
Teachers failing
Our hero lives on TV
No my break keeps all eyes closed
While his are so open
Take it in three ways, I know it
Nowadays nothing wrong
Cause everything goes
We think trouble fulfilling 

Don't let me fall victim to this human nature
I know the way it is don't mean that's how its suppose
To be, oh I wonder where this broken
Place is going to take us, and where's the
Way I want to know.

Solange,"Who would've known, the wind and the sunshine
Would oh baby, baby
Build up these walls of mine
And I can't see you or breathe you
Cause there's trouble right beneath you
It's all in the night
But oh baby, baby
Come pick me up in your ride

I'm a cool low Jane
With the skip on my feet
I play tough as nails
With my heart on my sleeve
I'm nothing but a sand castle
Baby don't blow me away, away

Baby I know, you do that to all the girls
You know that I'm fragile, oh
Bay ba ba ba baby, don't blow me away
Baby I know, you do that to all the girls
You know that I'm fragile, oh
Bay ba ba ba baby, don't blow me away

Who would've known, the storm of my past time
Would oh baby, make me
Losing the song of the eye
And I can't believe you or read you
Cause there's pleasure in your preview
It's all in your eyes
But oh Mr. DJ, baby
Can you meet me outside

You're an old school dude
With the kick on ya shoes
You've got groove in ya hands
The way you spend those tunes
I'm nothing but a sandcastle
Baby don't blow me away, away

Baby I know, you do that to all the girls
Baby I'm fragile, oh
Bay ba ba ba baby, don't blow me away
Baby I know, you do that to all the girls
You know that I'm fragile, oh
Bay ba ba ba baby, don't blow me away

Ooh, and just like the ocean
Lays right there behind me
Look over my sandcastle
And there's a sight to see
Don't blow me away
Don't blow me baby

Ooh baby I know, you do that to all the girls
You know that I'm fragile, oh
Bay ba ba ba baby, don't blow me away

Where the girls feel like girls
And the world is painted cotton candy (cotton candy)
Where the sweet lemonade of McGregor street (sweet lemonade)
Was the best damn thing of the summer breeze
Your dad drives a foreign car (a foreign car)
And your mama looks like a beauty queen

Now the sour bitter taste (sour bitter taste)
Of a colorless waste
Seems to light up my nights somehow
And the music I play must be 
Loud, loud, loud, loud
Loud as can be
So I don't have to hear myself think (no, no)
So I don't to wake up from this dream (no, no)

I don't wanna sing no single mama blues
I'm not singing look at me I've been abused
Oh I'm another silly lost girl staring at you (staring at you)
So maybe I'll put on my high heel shoes (ba, ba)
And soar the night away (ba, ba)
And soar the night away (ba, ba,)
But whatever I do

I'm not gonna slow this bird down (down)

I'm not gonna fall face first in this spiral called a life
I'm not in denial (no)
I'm not suicidal (no)
Not an alcoholic (no)
I'm not out here hoein'
So just shut the fuck up (shut the fuck up)

Once in a while (once in a while)
When the sun does its job
Lets the clouds take a nice day off (day off)
I can breeze through the day
And just run through the night (run through the night)
Hearing cheers come from those big blue eyes
His smile blazes like fireworks
On the evening of fourth of July
So I got reason to fly

Slowin' down (down, down, down, down)
Slowin' down (down, down, down, down)

Sitting right there beside me
On a spring day
Maturity had his mercy
Cause he seem so close to perfect
In just every way
We parted ways but
By May I was in his arms
Again I knew that he was
Different by the proof that
I was feeling 

Oh how love
Can sneak up on you
And tell you just what to do
It has no time, no place
It's just chooses you

By June we were here to stay
I thank you August for your grace
It's just to bad October didn't
Do the same. 

And I sure wish we made it boy

Vacation is now over
And fall just walked up
And said good morning
How can I fix you coffee
If you live so damn far away from me

But I hope by December
You would come to your senses
You think of me and you remember
Oh how love

That I know, that seasons change
People travel, people change
But see what we had
We had that kind of love
That just doesn't go away

In a lifetime
Now why, now why

So tell me, is it real love? Some kind of mistake
They made together that we couldn’t anticipate?
And my attraction to you may bother much worse
But it’s either something maybe
A longing and hatred of myself
But one or two end up alone
So the night I saw you, I could pretend I felt you
You’re beautiful and I felt like everybody saw
But the truth is, so much that I hated your endorsement
Try and deny it, I tried to fight it
But I bought you red color with a 99 buff
Looking for the diamond line to us
But eventually become a asshole
To the others, the group from the outside world
So now I’m calling out for a way
To give myself in
Remember when you kissed me, when I was 17
Your skin so soft and you were the shit
But you loved me

So maybe then we’re better off
Well maybe if this is all you wanted it
Leave me alone

Some want the chemicals to bring on a trance
Fate oscillator making crazy demands, for now

Until it comes around again

Solar Twins,"Now the king told the boogie men
You have to let that raga drop
The oil down the desert way
Has been shakin' to the top
The shiek he drove his Cadillac
He went a' cruisnin' down the ville

On the radiator grille

We ban that boogie sound
Degenerate the faithful
With that crazy Casbah sound
But the Bedouin they brought out
The electric camel drum
The local guitar picker
Got his guitar picking thumb
As soon as the shareef
Had cleared the square
They began to wail

Now over at the temple
Oh! They really pack 'em in
The in crowd say it's cool
To dig this chanting thing
But as the wind changed direction
The temple band took five
The crowd caught a wiff
Of that crazy Casbah jive

The king called up his jet fighters
He said you better eaarn your pay
Drop your bombs between the minarets
Down the Casbah way
As soon as the shareef was
Chauffeured outta there
The jet pilots tuned to
The cockpit radio blare
As soon as the shareef was
Outta their hair
The jet pilots wailed

He thinks it's not kosher
Fundamentally he can't take it.
You know he really hates it.

Solas,"I sat within the valley green
I sat me with my true love
My sad heart strove the two between
The old love and the new love

The old for her the new that made me
Think on Ireland dearly
While the soft wind blew down the glen
And it shook the golden barley

T'was hard the woeful words to frame
T'was worse the tide that bound us
But harder still to bear the shame
Of foreign chains around us

And so I said the mountain glen
I'll seek at morning early
And join the bold united men
While soft wind shakes the barley

While sad I kissed away her tears
My fond arms 'round her flinging
When a foe man's shot burst on our ears
From out the wild wood ringing

And a bullet pierced my true love's side
In life's young spring so early
And on my breast in blood she died
While soft wind shakes the barley

And blood for blood without remorse
I've taken at oulart hollow
I've lain my true love's clay full corpse
Where I full soon will follow

Around her grave I've wandered drear
Noon, night, and morning early
With a breaking heart when ever I hear
The wind that shakes the barley

Solas,"It's a mighty hard row my poor hands have hoed
My poor feet have travelled this hot dusty road
Out of your dustbowl and westward we roam
Through deserts so hot and through mountains so cold

I've wandered all over your green growing land
Wherever your crops are, I'll lend you my hand
On the edge of your cities, you'll see me and then
I come with the dust and I'm gone with the wind

California, Arizona, I've worked on your crops
And northward up to Oregon to gather your hops
I've dug beets from the ground, I've cut grapes from the vine
To set at your table that white sparkling wine

Green pastures of plenty from the dry desert ground
From the grand Coolie Dam where the waters run down
In every state of this union we migrants have been
We work on the land and we'll fight until we win

It's always we ramble, that river and I
All along your green valleys I'll work till I die
Travel this road until death sets me free
Because pastures of plenty must always be free",Pastures of Plenty

Seldom seen, a scarecrow's dream 
I hang in the hopes of replacement 
Castles tall, I built them all

And if you ever hear me calling out 
And if you've been by paupers crowned

Fading in fear of the coming day 
Heroes' tales, like nightingales

And if you've been by paupers crowned

Solas,"I adore thee, Mother Mary
But would you change me back to a witch
And let me live in the arms of a sorry old elm?
Give the gypsy moths a realm of their own
For a postman's fee would I work for thee
From that tree would I swoop down and leave
A billion blue eggs of eternity
And in no time you'd have your own sea

Don't just stare, I mean it really
Hear my prayer, I give it freely
Are you there, fleur de lis?

I adore thee, Mother Mary
But would you change me back to a witch
And let me live in the arms of a willow?
Fly around not wearing a stitch
For so long has this room been so hollow
We wait at the gate for an echo
In the flesh of your newly-cleaned frescoes
Where Jesus holds John to his breast

Wrapped around and rocking slowly
No one bound to be so holy
In your gown of fleur de lis

I adore thee, Mother Mary
But would you change my back to a witch?
As a witch would I love you more than any man
So give a wink, give a nod, give a damn

Never you mind about those seven seals

Soldier String Quartet,"Well, the first time that I saw you
I could not speak a word
My tongue was tied in giant knots
And I felt so disturbed

At the feeling rushing through me
The heat inside my veins
At the way my nerve ends tingle
Every time you call my name

I've got a lust ignited fever
And I can't put out the flame

Next time that I saw you
I felt so at ease
You had a languid disposition
I had an willingness to please

And your candy apple red lips
Full of violets and sex
Had me harder than a coal train
Had my collar wringing wet

Now I'm gonna crash and burn
But I'm not finished yet

Excited at the thought I might get me some
Lick it off my fingers
Taste it on my tongue

A masterpiece of grace
And animated work of art
Who's acquired a taste

For the flesh of weaker lovers
Lie down on their backs
To be ridden at your leisure
And be taken off like hats

I'm not here for you to walk on
And I'm not your welcome mat

Soldiers of Jah Army,"I open my eyes, each morning I rise
To find the truth I know that is there.
I'm lucky to breathe, I'm lucky to feel,
I'm glad to wake up, I'm glad to be here.
With all of this world, and all of it's pain,
All of it's lies, and all of its let downs...
I still feel a sense of freedom -
So glad I'm around.

It's my freedom, can't take it from me
I know it won't change
But, we need some understanding,
I know we'll be alright...

Alright.

The day I am gone, and the day that I leave
I'll never regret one minute of life.
I've learned from the joy, I've learned from the tears...
I've walked through the dark, now I seen a light.
Every tongue of everyone
Of every state in every land,
Has every thing to be thankful for...

It's my freedom

'cause I, I wait on you
'cause you wait on me - so I wait on you

I open my eyes, each morning I rise
To find the truth I know that is there.
I can't tell you how, you can't tell me why -
But living my life is all that I care.
The burden can be, sometimes, bigger than me,
Sometimes, stronger than me, and hard to bear.
But I couldn't care less, no stress 'cause
Jah put me here.

It's my freedom

I know you know -
I wait on you
'cause you wait on me - so I wait on you
We've really gotta stop...

Coming out of 112 one late night
Seen some scandalous hoes in my eye sight
Now being the bitch I am, payed it no mind
Gave niggaz that then hoped in the ride
Pulled out the heat from under the seat
Make sure the doors locked and the guns cocked
Pulled out the lock
Now I'm leavin the spot
Made a right on Cheser Bridge
Now I'm rollin down the block
Floatin across 80 by north
I seen some headlights rollin tight behind the Porche
MotherFucker bumped my shit
Oh now it's on
Thinkin it's an accident
Though I could be wrong
{motherfucker} Payin myself if niggaz really want it
Hit another exit so a bitch wouldn't get cornered
Couldn't keep going, niggaz will follow you home
Smack you with the chrome and take everything you own
I was taught better than that
So I grabs the gat
Holds my own
Don't need no one to watch my back
Lookin towards the heavens through the sun roof
Shit, I know I ain't untouchable and I know I ain't bullet proof
But I'll put it on these niggaz if need be
Your dead, On some two to you chest and two to your head
Lord please don't let it go there
All I see is a BP and I'm in the middle of nowhere
I'm ready for whatever and I know the routine
Before I get out the whip I check the gun magazine
Hoped out like ""What the fuck ya'll got to be crazy""
Some tall nigga talkin bout ""Yo hold on baby, it was just an accident""
I can't believe this happening
Then I see the Cherokee pull up in the back of him
Now I'm really on p
Oh, that's them same bitches from the club that was grilling me
So I pulled out the fifth
You niggaz coming for me
Money had his hands up, I smacked him with the heat
that's when one bitch hoped out the jeep, I fired a shot
I missed her
But it cornered the drivers side and hit her sister
I ducked behind my whip
Bitch still popping
Wait for her to stop so I can hit her with a hot one
It's getting hard to maneuverer
I kicked my heels off
Had him knocked out
Stumbled to his shit and them he peeled off
Perfect distraction
GS is passin
I rose platinum sounded like a round of applause
I pack a line when a cock it back and I rore's
Now I'm the type that will get at the drama to it's gone
You bitches want to dance then they playin our song
I'm done fucking with you
Jumped behind the dumpster
Reload the pistol
Pucker up until it kiss ya
I can't explain why this is going on
But tonight ot's on
Fuck who right and fuck who wrong
I got you in my sight, gun in my palm
Surprisingly calm
Lick of a shot, hit her in the arm
She running got my gun hot
Try to escape she pulled her dead friend out of the driver's side
Licked off a shot
Put it in the leg
I ain't gonna kill you quick, bitch I'm gonna make you beg
She still got in though and mashed the gas
I put four in the door and got out of the way fast
The jeep swerved and started to stray
Heading for the gas tank guiding my stance
Hit it with the last one, contact,it blows up
I bolted out before the APB shows up
Throwed my shit and fifth
Bucked forty on the dash
In my rear view
I seen the aftermath of the blast
To protect mine I send demons to hell
Stay strong just to live long
Those who weak they and fell
Knowing happened shouldn't have went down but it did
If it's me and you, bitch I gots to live
I know with guns hell
Only one can prevail
Either it's a done deal
Live by steel or behind steel
Ain't nothing fair
We in this for real
Could have ended up dead tonight or ended up in jail
Pacing in my cell
Trying to raise bail
And on top of all that, this bitch made me break my motherfucking nail
Fucked my shit up

Now I got to get this shit fixed",Da Story

Nightmares of love gone wrong
Got me writin' this song 
Played it out, back in my mind and heart you used to belong
Rewind it back, thought it was nice when 2 became 1

Bet you never thought Sole' would turn and leave you with none
Would of thought I gave you life, had me bent like a comma
Love turned to hate for fillin' my life with bullshit and drama
Played games, told me lies, steady pullin' these strings

And put me up in fly ass cribs and had my flossin' them things
While you was runnin' wild, had me busy shoppin' and shit
Hittin' the clubs with my girls, wasn't no stoppin' a bitch
Throwin' bills like I'm Mickey, I was spendin' it fast

Sure money nice but sure as hell don't make relationships last
Gave my all, did it all, tryin' to make sure it worked
While you ran the streets and even had me doin' your dirt
Dumb tricks and dumb skits I was pullin' for you

A dumb bitch and dumb shit I went through
For the love of you

And you know
I didn't want to live without you babe
Never thought I would throw your love away
Now I'm gone and you're lonely, it's a shame
But I did it for the love of you, babe

Would of gave my life to save yours, nigga
Push came to shove
A bullet with your name I'd change to mine
And nigga, that's love

Prayers that you'd be spared from wickedness that lived in the streets
And when them niggas you was beefin' wit start bringin' da heat
I got involved in dumb shit that didn't involve me at all
Had bitches scratchin' up my car and then you havin' the gall

To say it wasn't your fault and that you wasn't to blame
Thought you would come home after drama, have me screamin' your name
Young and dumb, I took you back pretendin' I couldn't see
You havin' babies on the side while you still fuckin' wit me

Things was never right, forever fight that's what we would do
Then I saw the light my game was tight from runnin' wit you
You had me stressed out and thinkin' that its time that I quit
So I wouldn't leave, had me believe I wasn't worth shit

It's crazy, yo it amaze me, these afairs of the heart
I look back and realize it wasn't love from the start

[Chorus: x4]

[Sole']
How things can change, one day infatuated, washin' your drawls
Another day, it's screams and fightin' dishes breakin' on walls
Walk in relationship, I'm sane thinkin' that you were too
A year later, I'm fuckin' crazy, throwin' glasses at you

And scratchin' up yo car, I take it far, I'm cuttin' yo tires
Don't understand it, why my heart is steady playin' wit fire
I turned psychotic, you got it, in this sick relationship
I'm tryin' to run you off the road, you and that broke-down bitch

I'm too fly for that shit, I'm lookin' back in disgust
The nights I cried, the times you lied all blown away with a gust
Things I did for your love, they was never returned
Gave all the jewelry to my moms and then your pictures I burned

You can't turn no little boy into no grown ass man
So change yo game and get it tight, if that's your previous plan
Boots is made for walkin', finally learned what life was about
Pulled it together, grabbed my Gucci boots and stepped the fuck out

Solé,"[intro]
Yeah, at one point, I thought I couldn't live without you
But now, I don't how the fuck I lived with you
But I just take that shit as a lesson learned
That what goes around, comes around
And yours is comin' muthafucka, believe that

[sole']
Nightmares of love gone wrong
Got me writin' this song
Played it out, back in my mind and heart you used to belong
Rewind it back, thought it was nice when 2 became 1
Bet you never thought sole' would turn and leave you with none
Woulda thought I gave you life, had me bent like a comma
Love turned to hate for fillin' my life with bullshit and drama
Played games, told me lies, steady pullin' these strings
And put me up in fly ass cribs and had my flossin' them things
While you was runnin' wild, had me busy shoppin' and shit
Hittin' the clubs with my girls, wasn't no stoppin' a bitch
Throwin' bills like I'm mickey, I was spendin' it fast
Sure money nice but sure as hell don't make relationships last
Gave my all, did it all, tryin' to make sure it worked
While you ran the streets and even had me doin' your dirt
Dumb tricks and dumb skits I was pullin' for you
A dumb bitch and dumb shit I went through
For the love of you

1 - [tamar]
And you know
I didn't wanna live without you babe
Never thought I would throw your love away
Now I'm gone and you're lonely, it's a shame
But I did it for the love of you, babe

Repeat 1

[sole']
Woulda gave my life to save yours, nigga
Push came to shove
A bullet with your name I'd change to mine
And nigga, that's love
Prayers that you'd be spared from wickedness that lived in the streets
And when them niggas you was beefin' wit start bringin' da heat
I got involved in dumb shit that didn't involve me at all
Had bitches scratchin' up my car and then you havin' the gall
To say it wasn't your fault and that you wasn't to blame
Thought you would come home after drama, have me screamin' your name
Young and dumb, I took you back pretendin' I couldn't see
You havin' babies on the side while you still fuckin' wit me
Things was never right, forever fight that's what we would do
Then I saw the light my game was tight from runnin' wit you
You had me stressed out and thinkin' that it's time that I quit
So I wouldn't leave, had me believe I wasn't worth shit
It's crazy, yo it amaze me, these afairs of the heart
I look back and realize it wasn't love from the start

Repeat 1 (4x)

[sole']
How things can change, one day infatuated, washin' your drawls
Another day, it's screams and fightin' dishes breakin' on walls
Walk in relationship, I'm sane thinkin' that you were too
A year later, I'm fuckin' crazy, throwin' glasses at you
And scratchin' up yo car, I take it far, I'm cuttin' yo tires
Don't understand it, why my heart is steady playin' wit fire
I turned psychotic, you got it, in this sick relationship
I'm tryin' to run you off the road, you and that broke-down bitch
I'm too fly for that shit, I'm lookin' back in disgust
The nights I cried, the times you lied all blown away with a gust
Things I did for your love, they was never returned
Gave all the jewelry to my moms and then your pictures I burned
You can't turn no little boy into no grown ass man
So change yo game and get it tight, if that's your previous plan
Boots is made for walkin', finally learned what life was about
Pulled it together, grabbed my gucci boots and stepped the fuck out

Repeat 1 to fade

Thought you come wit' me, heard it from who? Damn lie

Puttin' it down, me and Santa forever, blazed that
Hit the door, and my nigga is waitin', I'm wit' that
Put it on him like a champ and ya never forget that

Your girlfriend's lyin', baby; it wasn't me
Your girl said I hit it, baby; it wasn't me
Your girl wants to do it to me
She wants to give it to me
She will not stop until I let her come and do it to me

[Sole]
I need to ask you a question
This thing that I heard; it got me stressin'
I'm guessin', baby, comin' to you for your confession
If you did it, then you besta tell me straight up
'Cause what I heard completely overwhelmed me
Don't try to sell me, then compel me to be packin' and gone
Or better yet, I'll pack you up before the end of the song
But if I'm wrong, then my complete apology; you will see
This cannot happen; now you know that I don't want to believe
That you would be forever lettin' other women receive
The love you give me everyday
I find it hard to conceive
But if it's true, then I'm a have to tell you this is the end
I'll ask you once, not again
Was you f***in' my friend?
Tell me now

[Chorus x 2]

[Sole]
Now let me tell you what she told me
She said that you was fake and phony
F***in' my homie, actin' like you don't even know me
Sayin' time and time again that you was leavin' me lonely
Ridin' my pony, Angie and this chick named Romie
Tellin' me the way you hit it when I left for the Keys
Talkin' 'bout the carpet burnin' she received to the knees
The multiple orgasms with the greatest of ease
And orally the way you had her screamin', beggin' you please
And she was trouble from the start when I met her one night
If I leave, ""Dear John"" will be the letter you find
If you want her, you can have her
It ain't wetter than mine
It be another man's gain
It ain't better than mine
Now tell me

[Chorus x 2]

[Sole]
I know she lies, but the details was all too clear
And I know better than to run with everything that I hear
Trust was never a problem for us
It was perfectly clear
It's been like happy ever after for the past two years
I know she wants you though
She said it on the night that we met
Now she takin' drastic measures
Tryin' to see if she get
She fightin' in a battle that she know she never could win
Step it down to a six when you workin' with ten
Want to walk in my heels?
Want to walk with my deals?
Want to know how it feel?
I'm just bein' for real
I take your word for it this time
I'm stayin' with you
Make sure it never happen
I ain't playin' with you

Why I can't bring that body ?
Flipped it last time, press rewind

Laid back, fade back plenty of times
Tommy boy's filled with plenty of rhymes
Back there niggas never called me fine
One of the guys that scouts the scene
Roughed up, stuffed up, left the scene
Why'all bitches wouldn't never believe
That their niggas was checkin' for me
Little girl, curls, that was me
Little world, swirls, that was me
Drama unfold, that was me
Drama fun, girls that was me
Scrawny little thing, as a child
Men would chuck, runnin' wild
Me called names?
Not allowed
Gotta be something that was vile
Wide eyed, cried, takin' 'em blowin'
Start ridin', cried, ??
Flip that, start lookin' for shows
Spit that, time I have to go
On the car 'round the block, runnin' with boys
Only girl got slick mccoy
Had a little crush, name was troy
Got a little rush, loved the joy
Bent adolescent tryin' to get down
To werin' a frown
Steady comin' up, wonderin' how
Never been as fly, so look at me now

Started growin' up, started to bloom
Same damn thing, chased out the storm
E-lay see-lay caught at noon
Write more, fight more, stay in my room
Gettin' with the wrong guy, never again
Get it from the wrong guy, never a friend
Try to go straight, world tryin' to end
No such thing, 'cause I'm tryin' to mend
Niggas try to see me, never before
Bitches want to be me, never before
Niggas that would dis me, tryin' to score
Bitches now jealous of me whore
Heard they relay many of lines
Got played, got laid many times
Crushed inhibition, lookin' for signs

Now I'm the hottest thing on the scene
Straight line, got mine, know what I mean?
Keep it on top, not a raid
Hope it don't fly, masquerade..
Myself from them days of play
Stories like this that I relate
Hopin' that, don't start to slip
Hopin' that, can keep a grip
Write rhymes that I can flip
Mothafuckin' business, it's a trip
Learned that life ain't a game
Passed up, passed by, it's a shame
Never let ya life go insane

Still be sittin' there, still complain

I stayed there helpin' you through it
I f***ed up too and you knew it

Many times I thought that you blew it
But then you'd always make it right with me
No fight with me, forever kept it tight with me
Sometimes you ditched the fellas 

Just to come and ride with me
Then stripped me down, licked me up, every night with me
You never made me feel I owed you for the deeds that you done
Re-payed you with my loyalty, promised to give you a son

Can't nothin' come between us ever boy
You know you the one
And love I give you everyday, you know it's second to none

Keep every gat on spit

Solé,"[intro]
Yeah, feel my pain
Filled with pain
It's a struggle everyday
Did I walk in the right door?
I don't know
Yeah

I never back down, I do what it takes me
Things gettin' shaky, can't let it break me
A lot love us, some hate me
Some friends snake me
Sometimes the shit just make me
Wanna grab the tote and lose it
It ain't just tracks and raps
It's a whole other side to music
Things you can't see on mtv, but it's here
Lord, what's happened to me?
I'm really out there
Was this the right door to walk in?
Lips movin', but ain't nobody talkin'
I plead and I cry to the heaven skies above to show me love
Wish that I could backtrack and make it like it was, but I can't

1 - when the pain's in me
I wish that it would let me be
But where can I run and where do I turn
When it's chasin' me?

Repeat 1

I got to deal with the what is, fuck what if's
Got to put it down and make it right for my kids
How many parties, how many bottles gotta pop?
How many more gots to die?
When this shit gon' stop?
I feel it in my heart, but I plays my part
It's a whole bigger picture so stay true to your art
Until I'm hauled off in the car
Swear it wasn't this dark when I got my start
Internin', been chart burnin', kept learnin'
Kept earnin', and the wheels kept turnin'
But after all the hit songs and the fame is gone
Your money right, but everything else done gone wrong
You're lonely, a lot of bitches is phony
Wanna know me just to tell niggas we homies
Whole time bitch schemin' on my rolley
It's hard to watch everyone you with
When you rich, niggas with you try to get you
Plenty wanna hit you, I learned it now
It was no way out, now it's no turnin' around
Niggas that was with me, I praise 'em now
A toast to the red zone, raise 'em now

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Silence, all eyes on me
But I can see through 'em like I knew 'em, so I walk to 'em
Extend my hand, try to talk to 'em
Stand while others ran and try to understand
Two sides of a story, let me tell my side of it
It's evident, it's there, I can't hide from it
How much for the soul in the window?
Most wanna be rich and famous
It's dangerous, you'll find out in a minute though
I love the close ones, sometimes feel like I got no one
Those that was there, I know I owe 'em
Backstabbers, I brush 'em off
In a room with straight faces, can't trust 'em all
Rush and fall, pause, let nature take it's course
Stand firm 'cause I serve a higher force
And I can scream 'til I'm hoarse, hear me lord
See I'm ? like 3 dice, riskin' it all in street life

At the fork in the road, I made a hard right
I put the work in, then escaped the hard life
I put it down 'til it's time to lay me down
Wanna be free, but a lot of shit weighs me down
The light's dimmin', who gon' save me now?
It's all good, but it ain't gravy now
We gots to do it for the babies now
And bring 'em up to correct all the wrong we've done
And don't let 'em sing the same song we sung
Like, killin' each other off one by one
And turn 'em from slangin' the drugs, into some'in
You can make it out the ghetto in more ways than one
But for now I'mma pray for better days to come

You out?

Holla at ya man tomorrow
Aight, I'll get up with you tomorrow
You get up with me tomorrow?
Aight I'm going up in here

Coming out of 112 one late night
Seen some scandalous hoes in my eye sight
Now being the bitch I am, payed it no mind
Gave niggaz that then hoped in the ride

Pulled out the heat from under the seat
Make sure the doors locked and the guns cocked
Pulled out the lock, now I'm leavin' the spot
Made a right on Cheser Bridge

Now I'm rollin' down the block, floatin' across 80 by north
I seen some headlights rollin' tight behind the Porsche
Motherfucker, bumped my shit, oh, now it's on
Thinkin' it's an accident though I could be wrong

(Motherfucker)
Payin' myself if niggaz really want it
Hit another exit, so a bitch wouldn't get cornered
Couldn't keep going, niggaz will follow you home
Smack you with the chrome and take everything you own

I was taught better than that
So I grabs the gat, holds my own
Don't need no one to watch my back
Lookin' towards the heavens through the sun roof

Shit, I know I ain't untouchable and I know I ain't bullet proof
But I'll put it on these niggaz if need be
You're dead, on some two to you chest and two to your head
Lord, please don't let it go there

All I see is a BP and I'm in the middle of nowhere
I'm ready for whatever and I know the routine
Before I get out the whip I check the gun magazine
Hoped out like, ""What the fuck y'all got to be crazy""

Some tall nigga talkin' 'bout, ""Yo hold on baby, it was just an accident""
I can't believe this happening
Then I see the Cherokee pull up in the back of him
Now I'm really on p

Oh, that's them same bitches from the club that was grilling me
So I pulled out the fifth, you niggaz coming for me
Money had his hands up, I smacked him with the heat
That's when one bitch hoped out the jeep

I fired a shot, I missed her
But it cornered the drivers side and hit her sister
I ducked behind my whip, bitch still popping
Wait for her to stop so I can hit her with a hot one

It's getting hard to maneuverer
I kicked my heels off, had him knocked out
Stumbled to his shit and them he peeled off
Perfect distraction, GS is passin'

I rose platinum, sounded like a round of applause
I pack a line when a cock it back and I rore's
Now I'm the type that will get at the drama to it's gone
You bitches wanna dance then they playin' our song

I'm done fucking with you, jumped behind the dumpster
Reload the pistol, pucker up until it kiss ya
I can't explain why this is going on but tonight it's on
Fuck who right and fuck who wrong

I got you in my sight, gun in my palm, surprisingly calm
Lick of a shot, hit her in the arm, she running got my gun hot
Try to escape, she pulled her dead friend out of the driver's side
Licked off a shot, put it in the leg

I ain't gonna kill you quick, bitch, I'm gonna make you beg
She still got in though and mashed the gas
I put four in the door and got out of the way fast
The jeep swerved and started to stray

Heading for the gas tank guiding my stance
Hit it with the last one contact, it blows up
I bolted out before the APB shows up
Throwed my shit and fifth, bucked forty on the dash

In my rear view, I seen the aftermath of the blast
To protect mine, I send demons to hell
Stay strong just to live long, those who weak, they and fell
Knowing happened shouldn't have went down but it did

If it's me and you, bitch, I gots to live
I know with guns hell, only one can prevail
Either it's a done deal
Live by steel or behind steel

Ain't nothing fair, we in this for real
Could have ended up dead tonight or ended up in jail
Pacing in my cell, trying to raise bail and on top of all that
This bitch made me break my motherfucking nail

Fucked my shit up
I told Tricky ass, I ain't wanna go out tonight

About, who right, who wrong

The same ol' song
See I'm a fresh hit
Another girl goin' get
Slow rides, through the park

Gettin' hugs in the dark
I know you don't trust me
That's why you beeped my thirty times
But I wasn't doin nothin but in the street gettin mine

And everytime I tried to explain you wouldn't listen
So I left irratated, confused on what to do
You, used to bring light, now you bring pain
So I gotta let you go and let you do ya thang

You used to bring light, but now you bring pain
So I gotta let ya go and let ya do ya thang

[Chorus: x2]
We've been trying too long
(uh, yeah, to get it right but it just won't work)
We've been trying too long
(yeah, uh, to get it right but it just won't work)

[Sole']
Don't mean to press ya but I'm needin to know
If this the end
And if you leave, am I your friend or your foe?
Don't want to go, you see me turn and look

I walk away slow
Motion be the way
Make sure you catch the kisses I blow
I see you lookin like you want to take me back in yo' arms

Like when you used to hold me tight
And you protect me from harm
But now we can't resolve the problems that we share
It's a mess

I thought we'd work it out
But now it seems I have to confess
That this the end
But you still knowin that I wish it's the start

You slowly breakin my heart
I gave you everything, you tore it apart
Can't go in circles anymore 'cause we been trying too long
Sometimes you just can't work it out

That's why I'm crying this song
You, used to bring light, but now you bring pain
So I'm a have to let ya go and let ya do ya thang
You used to bring light, but now you bring pain

So now I gotta let ya go and let ya do ya thang

[Chorus: x2]

[Gipp]
Me and you, used to be cute
But now we paint a different picture
Love'll get 'cha, and leave ya deaf, dumb, and blind
Everytime, we had some good days, remember those

Momma told me that's the way love goes
So I'ma leave it at that, get my hat, get my strap, get my bags
Be gone in the wind, baby girl

[Sole']
But now I hear you so I guess it's nothin left to be said
It's time that I fled
It's feelin like a blow to the head
I thought that soon I'd see the day that you and I would be wed

But now the end has come, the love is gone, I'm cryin instead
And you, used to bring light, but now you bring pain
So I'm a have to let ya go and let ya do ya thang

[Gipp]
Nah, you used to bring light, but now you bring pain
So I gotta let ya go and let ya do ya thang
You used to bring light, but now you bring pain

Go on numbers, go on home. 
There's nothing to see except insults thrown at body of works. 
Felt it before, and during, and after re-occuring. 
Happening for a reason, I never regret, 
So I'll never be sorry enough to earn back the respect. 
I'm a broken record, playing out a broken dream on shitty speakers. 
Man it sucks to be myself and hurts to bite the lips. 
It kills to think they say I'm becoming something else. 
Yet I feel the same, 
And dirty, and guilty and alone, 
And needing to acknowledge that I need no approval. 
Here I am again at square one who am I and who are they? 
Consuming all of my time, this ain't hip-hop, 
But I'm supposed to be a rapper. 
Why did I make this place? 
I'm far away from home and I have no home. 
Why did I come to this place? 
Far away from home and I have no home. 

So I sleep under papers and talk to myself in public places, 
I stagger and twitch, and drive a 400 dollar car. 
I'm taking it on the road again, this time I'm never coming back 'til I'm dead. 
Pour another keg. 
Shake my leg it's broken. 
That's my name run it through the mud I still remain 
A beast, a mountain of moss purging all the stagnance. 
This stage is the saddest place I've ever been. 
Let this be a lesson, 
Let us be cheapened. 
Let's not be the lesser, 
Let's beat around the bush 'til my brain rots, and apples fall 
And everyone indulges and enjoys, and maybe dies of cancer. 
We all gotta go, it's all gotta go, and I've changed my mind again. 
I'm not gonna go out like I should. 
For I'm so humbled, I have no shame, many dignities, and an inability to simplify. 
So throw things, I'll catch them, and hopefully in time you will to. 
Let me breath for you, you're choked up and afraid to show it. 
I'm a person, not a poet and it's wack to rhyme poet with show it, 
But see it's obvious I can't change and I'm not finished. 
But I live in this space so give that much to me. 
The freedom to be in a space, 
A space like my own air, 
Heir to no one's throne. 

La la la this song is not a message. 
Arrogant people make me. 
Silent people interest me. 
Why can't anybody leave me in peace? 
Why bother? 
Brothers, sisters, orphans, and dolphins. 
No one person is that special, we ride the short bus to oblivion, 
Living in a commune. 
It's a small rock we're standing, 
I wanna understand, I need to lay down. 
The background moves so fast it's hard to see the faces of my loved ones. 
But their voices I follow and somehow end back in the same place, 
'Til everything stops. 
And nobodys there, and I'm walking down the street mumbling over the sound of my footsteps echoing off; 
Looking for a place to lay my feet

Sole,"[Sole]
Thank God I never made it to Earth, what a happy place
how I long to be depressed, to be a grouch, get away

Yo, Yo Here I stand in the desert sands 
There I lay in a dust storm, brain storms 
Some day we may form a massive collective mind with no bandages 
I kneel down to fantasy of what is real 
Thus far the only signs of freshness 
I came across upon this quest was nothingness 
possessed to find truth at all costs elementally 
I walk a thin line of good and evil coincidentally 
We all believe in god and nature and higher levels 
Yet we dwell with devil's machinery in lower levels of raped scenery 
It's seemingly endless 
Demeaning and mindless, we're friendless and meaningless 
Living in darkness walking with candles 
And while I'm on the subject of difference is lame 
I've noticed the more things change the more things stay the same 
To stay in focus 
It's hopeless to go against the grain while new to this 
Till I'm menopaused and then ejected from the uterus 

Chorus 
And I've seen so far into the night 
And lingered in the land of no night 

Day two I've left the earth and all is alien and foreign 
Females are wailing and I'm swimming in a cest pool 
It's pouring 
It ain't dark no more, no more worth the fight 
My old candles turn to sunglasses, I can't stand the light 
Yet I can't stand the rain these bodies I live with are numb 
And I can't stand the pain these children I play with are dumb 
A figure points a finger and whispers, ""leave"" 
This small porcelain tomb
It will be all I will have achieved 
And I refuse to be excrement 
dash to the left and to try to and break for my life 
A large hand grabs me now, there's no escape 
I'm thrown into a whirlpool, spinning until infinity 
Grasping for an oxygen breath, but I don't breath that yet 
Inhale the H20 and thank life I'm still living breath 
Giving death a hell of a run until the movement stops 
Bubble to the surface almost dead ass out 
Starving cold and alone until I pass out 

chorus 

Living ain't all that, I want to go back to non-existence 
The womb was not meant to be a tomb, but once I've gone the distance 
Won't sleep to see revenge for my dead sibling, I miss her
I watched my brother be impaled as I held the hand of my sister 
Kissed her when she was void 
Missed the missile, I'm docile
Amongst dead soil and fossil till I'm deployed 
None of it ever happened 
As far as I'm concerned I'm barred 
Should've died months ago in the condom 
and this wouldn't have been so hard 
Should'nt of, but it's not that way 
I fought that way 
I lay until I no longer thought that way 
None of this was worth the fight, I should have been disposed 
At night time, laying only half of the trash can 
Not white trash in a trailer park 
Or a dismembered rash lashing utter last sole 
member of a coathanger tailored art 
With no formed identity blanketed by newspapers 
Remedy be levity, life be the penalty 
This body in a mask grow fast carry out the masquerade 
I lay in the cut to hear lies, pawns, peons, and tricks of this trade
In this eon let me be on and beyond the next decade 
There I stayed remain of flux to be another child saved

Indefensa frente al frío y la tormenta 
Frente al sueño del amor
Como gota en movimiento, contra el viento 
En silencio, te he de olvidar

Llovió sobre mis besos 
Llovió y el cielo me regaló 
Lluvia y silencio 
Llovió, llovió

Pequeñas huellas de tu amor
Que roto en mil pedazos cae 
Como la lluvia lo hace sobre el mar
Se confunden, se entregan y se unen
No queda de ella más 
Que el recuerdo de un momento 
Y en silencio, bajo la lluvia 
Te he de olvidar

Tú que quisiste ser un sueño 
Y yo que no podía más que verte y sonreír
Y aquel futuro que nos prometimos
Hoy se ha vuelto agua con el porvenir
Y se lamenta el cielo y se lamenta un dios
Y en un descuido se les oye llorar
Tú y yo pudimos ser de sueño y no
No somos más que de realidad",Llovió

De un amor imposible de un romance mal logrado

Sentada en un bar y esperando al papá, lorena escuchaba un piano
El pianista sonrió, y lorena cayó por aquel triguenisimo bahiano
Poeta, soñador sin rumbo y sin cruzados
Pero ella no se iría de su lado, no

Aquel bahiano de tierra y sol,le enseñó lo que es el amor
Aquel bahiano fue más que el cielo, fue más que un dios
La fuerza que los apoderó, fue la que luego nos traicionó
Ay, todavía se oye en el aire, a la lorena llorar de amor por

Por supuesto el padre, puso el grito en el cielo
' hija qué dirá tu madre y los demás

Y no pega a nuestra rica sociedad

Y voy a llevarte lejos para que no lo vuelvas a ver

Buscando la luz, de un amanecer
Cuando llegue el alba

Noche adentro irá, vencida de amor
La tristeza gris, de mi corazón
Cuando llegue el alba

A un costado del olvido, mis sueños maduraran
Reventando en luz, florecidos
Cuando llegue el alba
Viviré, viviré

Encontrarte fue, intuición de Dios
Todo nace en ti, como nací yo
Cuando llegue el alba
Viviré, viviré

Tus palabras son, fresco manantial
Sintiendo tu voz, aprendí a cantar
Cuando llegue el alba

Infame why pobre sin pueblo why sin valor

No es que yo esté llorando

Yo soy solo un pasajero

Conmigo vas

And take my heart out
Only if it's possible for you to live with it

Take my shoe and run a little faster, darling

And said
\""Leave this dark cold place\""
The rabbit is preparing something bad

So I ran
But lost my other shoe
I fell down to the grass
The rabbit jumped on me
And took my heart out
And put it in its place
So you would love it more

You took my shoe and run so fast to me, my darling

And breed by sad hard magic
Or the weird tricks she will use to get to him

So they cannot fly with her and tell to kill

You came my way and opened the door
I think of us and the love that we had
With half a chance I'd bring it all back

But I know
I know things always change
So I guess I gotta let you go

Walk away
Don't turn around 'cause you may see me cry
Walk away
Don't turn around don't even say goodbye
Don't turn around until you reach the other side

I tell my friends that you were the best
And as I stand just watching the rain
I pray that you were here once again

But I know
I know things always change
So I guess I gotta let you go

Solid HarmoniE,"It was late one night and we
had a fight
It seemed like nothing was going right
You turned around and you walked
right out the door
Now it's not the first time it's not
the last
I know all about your checkered past
And we've played this game one
thousand times before
Do you remember the night I can
see it so clear
All the sweet little things that you
said in my ear
There were promises made but I
think you forgot what you said
There's a real fine line between
love and hate
And I'm not the type to just sit and wait
I've made up my mind I can't
wait for you anymore, ok?
Chorus:
When we kiss - ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh I get such a rush
It feels like this - so perfect
when you give me love
And when we touch - ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh I'll forgive again
It means so much oh girl I really miss
when we kiss
So many days go by and I miss
you so - If it were up to me I'd
never let you go
You're the only true love in my
life and I want you to know
All this passion and pain I think
I'm going insane
You've got nothing to lose and as
much to gain
If you leave me today who's to
say you might leave me again
Do you remember the night I can
see it so clear
All the sweet little things that
you say in my ear
There were promises made but I
think you forgot what you said
There's a real fine line between
love and hate
I'm not the type to just sit and wait
I've made up my mind I can't
wait for you anymore, you got it?

A Thousand times
Keeping check
On destinies
Without reallity's memories

As time goes on
And we both bled
Let's put to rest
All the things We've said
We've paid our dues
And come this far
There's nothing left
To tear us apart

I could never ask

Solitude Aeturnus,"Which for me
In darkness turn
For as a shadow I shall return
After touch with spirit world
However there I may be hurled...
The dream of immortality
Are we drifting in shades of nowhere
Breath of death from wisp of life
Ingest in me
I ever stride
Among the shores of tranquil nights
Between the set and dawn of light...
The dream of immortality
Is leaving the joy of returning home
Wisper's clouds envelope frail
Colorless gaze which ever sails
Across the world
Once known to me
I cease
To begin
To ever be

Somewhere inside ourselves we lie
",Dream of Immortality
Solitude Aeturnus,"In a blackened blur of crowding clouds
I dropped my sorrow among the leaves
I took my place as wise men do
As the storm prepared its release
Through raging winds and weeping skies
I sat in the loneliness of solitude
I washed my eyes in growing streams
Earth's resistance
True magnitude
As black sky faded to blue
And again the Earth felt the sunrise
A silver mirror stood before me
Bequeath of the silent rainbow
A beautiful mirror of radiant splendor
As ominous as the autumn moon
It brought upon me endless wonder
Yet spoke of some unknown doom
As I reflect back on this day
No words could ever tell...
I saw my world
But could not see myself
In strange visions
And through the windows of dreams
We solemnly gaze beyond
What is revealed to our eyes
Exists already in our minds

Inside a dream
Revealing what shall come to be

When the great river has dried
We shall find the Kings from the East
Do not seal the words of the prophecy
The time is soon at hand
He who is unjust - let him be unjust still
He who righteous - let him be righteous still
And let he who walks on the path which is clear
Find peace within himself
We are our own
We reap what we sow
Heed the warning cast among ye
That bring sorrow upon the land
The cities will fall
The mountains will speak

The peace and comfort that he brings

Now that the Lord of Hosts is on the horizon
And with it brings the promises of plight

Solitude Aeturnus,"I was but a traveler
Floating endless through the sea
On the other side of knowledge
Through the pliancy of dreams
And voices there upon the ship
Spoke of radiant place's splendor
Beautiful shores with sands of gold
Wherein exists no torment or pain
What was I looking for
What could I have hoped for
On the white ship I sailed through the night
As we traveled for the Land Eternal
We passed many peaceful harbor
Where we could have found vibrant life
In a world known only in dreams
But vibrant was not eternal
So we continued upon our quest
Through misty lagoons of sparkling blue
And on through the pillars of the West
The land mist be adorned by beauty unknown
Never before beheld
The land of eternal life
Which ocean secrets had held
And as we left those shores of hope
And neared the end of the quest
The waters rose up before me
And fell there sharply beyond
The white ship and I were taken
Into man's withered and dying arms
What was I looking for
What could I have hoped for
The time that was mime was to parish with life

Ultimate drones of deceit

Weeping tears of crimson flame
For ashes that shall bear your name

Why must you forever exchange
The peace that gold can buy
For the vanity that it may?

And the night is as fair as the day.

[Chorus]
There'll be peace in the valley for me someway,
There'll be peace in the valley for me.
I pray no more sorrow and sadness or trouble will be,
There'll be peace in the valley for me.

There the flow'rs will be blooming,
the grass will be green,
And the skies will be clear and serene,
The sun ever shines, giving one endless beam
And no clouds there will ever be seen.

[Chorus]

There the bear will be gentle, the wolf will be tame,
And the lion will lay down by the lamb,
The host from the wild will be lead by a Child,
I'll be changed from the creature I am.

[Chorus]

No headaches or heartaches or misunderstands,
No confusion or troubles won't be
No frowns to defile, just a big endless smile
There'll be peace and contentment for me.

[Chorus]",Peace in the Valley
Solomon Burke,"Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on, let me stand
I am tired, I am weak, I am worn
Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

When my way grows drear
Precious Lord linger near
When my life is almost gone
Hear my cry, hear my call
Hold my hand lest I fall
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

When the darkness appears
And the night draws near
And the day is past and gone
At the river I stand
Guide my feet, hold my hand
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on, let me stand

Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light

Solomon Burke,"When a man loves a woman
Can’t keep his mind on nothin’ else
He’d trade your world for the good thing he’s found
If she is bad, he can’t see it, she can do no wrong
He'll turn his back on his best friend if she puts him down

When a man loves a woman he spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on to everything he needs
He’ll give all of his comforts just to sleep out in the rain
If she'll say that’s the way it's gotta be

Oh, this man loves this woman
I give everything I have
Trying to hold on to her sweet fine precious love
Baby please don’t make me feel so bad

When a man loves a woman
Deep down inside his soul she can bring him such misery
If she plays him for a fool, he’s the last one to know
Lovin' eyes always too blind to see

When a man loves a woman he can do her no wrong
He can only love one woman at a time
When a man loves a woman he got to treat that woman right
If he don't he'll lose that woman
That woman surely someday'll be mine

When a man loves a woman he got to do the best he can
Love her and keep her and treat her in every way
When a man loves a woman he should make that sacrifice
Promise he got to give to her his life

",When a Man Loves a Woman

He buys a gun, steals a

Tries to run, but he don't

And you're out of your depth in through the window she crept
Oh there's nowhere to go in the sleet and the snow

Is no more real to me
Than what it seems

Like a spark along a fuse
I feel your mark upon me now
As surely as the hand that leaves the bruise

Life is for the living
And life comes hard for some
The rest of us with flesh and blood
Make it hard all along

Was the freedom to refuse
Or something of my own to love enough
To hate
To lose

Is leaving smoke behind my eyes
But the part of me that wants to change
Fights the part of me that trys

Come see the golden light
Cause I've turned the gold light on
Sometimes god knows
You gotta learn to shine, shine, shine shine, shine gold.

I stepped out of darkness

Solomon Burke,"The accused will rise to be torn in two
Guilty of nothing but loving you
This is the judgement

And I'm willing to plead
How you don't want me
Hoping this torment will cease
Will I be released?

There'll be lies, there'll be tears
A jury of your peers
With a pitiful lack of experience
Hand down the judgement

And if I done wrong
And loved you too long
Stand up and just testify
How can I deny?

Objection overruled
I wait for my reprieve
With the trust of the deceived
The wisdom of the fool

It's his sorrowful face
Too heavy for his head
Cos he bowed it as something come over him
It was the judgement

He falls to his knees
Have mercy on me
He clings to the hem of her gown
She says, ""Just take him down.""",The Judgement
Solomon Burke,"Well you better listen my sister's and brothers,
'cause if you do you can hear
There are voices still calling across the years.
And they're all crying across the ocean,
And they're cryin' across the land,
And they will till we all come to understand.

[Chorus]
None of us are free.
None of us are free.
None of us are free, one of us are chained.
None of us are free.

And there are people still in darkness,
And they just can't see the light.
If you don't say it's wrong then that says it right.
We got try to feel for each other, let our brother's know that
We care.
Got to get the message, send it out loud and clear.

[Chorus]

It's a simple truth we all need, just to hear and to see.
None of us are free, one of us is chained.
None of us are free.
Now I swear your salvation isn't too hard too find,
None of us can find it on our own.
We've got to join together in spirit, heart and mind.
So that every soul who's suffering will know they're not alone.

[Chorus]

If you just look around you,
Your gonna see what I say.
Cause the world is getting smaller each passing day.
Now it's time to start making changes,
And it's time for us all to realize,
That the truth is shining real bright right before our eyes.

[Chorus]",None of Us Are Free

Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
If my hands are tied, must I wonder within
Who tied them and why?
And where have I been, where have I been

What good am I, while you softly weep
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
And I freeze in the moment like the rest that don't try
You tell me, what good am I ?

If I sat an' lay there while you slowly die

Someone to sob for you and never say good bye

Solomon Burke,"If I give my heart to you
Will you handle it with care?
Will you always treat me tenderly
And in every way be fair?

If I give my heart to you
Will you give me all your love in return?
Will you swear that you'll be true to me
By the star that shines above?

And will you sigh with me when I'm sad
Smile with me when I'm glad
And always be as you are with me tonight?

Think it over and be sure
Please don't answer till you do
And when you promise all these little things to me
Then I'll give my heart to you

Think it over and be sure
Please don't answer till you do
When you promise all these little things to me
That's when I'll give my heart
All of my heart to you, to you",If I Give My Heart to You
Solomon Burke,"Though my heart is heavy with grief
My faith is strong, bring me relief
Sometimes my dreams are closer
Sometimes my feelings are so far away
You've got a minute to rest and a second to pray

Now I've got to fall down on my knees
You can face the west, you can face the east
My tired eyes can see the coming of a better day
You've got a minute to rest and a second to pray
A minute to rest and a second to pray

It's the last thing you hear
The first thing you fear
The sign of the wasted years
And the pain with those tears

Battles across the ocean, battles outside my door
When night falls upon me, falls upon my mind
Before I'd lay, before I'd lay, before I'd lay
I take a minute to rest and a second to pray

You get a minute to rest, just a second to pray
You get a minute to rest and a second to pray
You get a minute to rest and a second to pray
You get a minute to rest and a second to pray

Pray with the women you love
Pray that the heaven's above
You got a second, you got a minute to rest
Get it in your mind, take up the time

You got a second to pray
Don't think about yesterday
Take a minute to rest, take a second to pray
You only got a minute to rest, to rest, to rest, to rest",A Minute to Rest and a Second to Pray
Solomon Burke,"I thank you, you turn my life around
Without you, true love never could be found
You see all my life I've been lonely, sad and blue
I thank you for all the things you do

Yes, I thank you, you turn my life around
And without you, true love never could be found
All my life I've been lonely, sad and blue
Oh, I thank you for all the wonderful things you do

First I thank you for understanding
And not being so demanding
I thank you for caring when nobody else cared
I thank you for just being there

I thank you for the love that you share
And the thoughts and you're always by my side
Never letting me go and letting me know
That you care, you love me

Well, I thank you for turning my life around
'Cause without you, true love never could be found
You see all my life I've always been so blue
And I thank you for all the things you do

I thank you for turning my life around
I thank you for the love I truly found
Because without you I've been lonely, sad and blue
I thank you for all the sweet things you do

I thank you for turning my life around
'Cause without you, true love never could be found
All my life I've been lonely, sad and blue
Now with you, I know just what love can do

",Thank You
Solomon Burke,"Here I am at home (hrum, hrum hrum)

I was afraid, to get out of the car
So I just sat there, I just sat there
How was I gonna tell them?
That I lost my job
Gotta go in there, gotta go in there
So we gathered 'round the table
Told them the news
And the look of desperation
Nearly broke me in two

Son, I know you wanted
Them running shoes
Gonna have to wait, they going have to wait
Darling, I know you wanted
That dress in the window
We gonna get it,
But it won't be now

Then my little girl looked at me,
With those big round eyes
And the words she told me,
Almost made me cry!

(Chorus)

We don't need it,
We can do without it,
We going to make it
No doubt about it
We're going stick together
Make it better
We don't need it
All we need is you

My son said;
Daddy, I got sixteen books
Why don't you take it, I want you to take it
The next door neighbor 
Asked me to rake the leaves
And I'm gonna do it, I'm sure gonna do it
'Cause I wanna help you out
Anyway I can
It's about time I learn, just to be a man 

My wife said;
Darling, we got so much stuff
Just sitting around here, just sitting around
Like grandmom's china, and the sterling silverware
Just sitting around here, just gathering dust
Ever since she past away
We ain't used it yet
So let's put it out in the front yard
And see what we can get

(Chorus)

And we don't need it
We can do without it,
We gonna make it
No doubt about it
We're going stick together
Make it better
We don't need it
All we need is you

Days and weeks,
And months went by
The big boss called,
In a lickup town (?)
Got my check
And brought it home
Yeah, it's been tough
But we've been blessed
Let's get them shoes
And that brand new dress!

(Chorus)

We don't need it
We can do without it,
We gonna make it
No doubt about it
We're going stick together
Make it better
We don't need it
All we need is you (you)

We don't need it
We can do without it,
We gonna make it
No doubt about it
We're going stick together
And make it better
We don't need it
All we need is you (loving you)

We can do without it
We gonna make it
No doubt about it
We're going stick together (begin fading)
And make it better
We don't need it
All we need is you

Of grim forest lake, in telluric angor

A leering abyss that beckons to fools

Atop a keep of lore, where hope yet shines
And black pennants reign in a suffocating night

Su memoria, su mirar

Espinas en mi alma el sembro
Aun vive en mis latidos siento yo
Suplico una plegaria, por favor
Liberalo de mi de este dolor

Me sueles consolar
En mis noches ya no duermo

You came to me, wiped me off my feet 
Like paradise lookin' in your eyes 
You take my breath away 
Baby, I'm here to say 

You make me feel special 
You're all that I need and more 
Fairytales do come true 
'cause they did when I met you 

-CHORUS- 
The only time I ever fell 
I fell for you 
Now I'm so in love 
So deep in love with you

When I'm with you, I get lost in time
When we're hand in hand
Our dreams intertwined
On and on like drifting off to sea
Never ending, you're all I need

You make me feel special
You're all that I need and more
Fairytales do come true
'cause they did when I met you

You're all that I need and more

Shit is tight like a man sittin' on dubs
That's what it was and that's what it's gonna be

You know that I'm your freak

Before so I could come over there
And put it down like a nigga supposed to
Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm talkin' bout

I'm not the boner that you think I am

Spending money on the latest styles

From head to toe I love it all

She's the hand at the end of the arm
And she's got a lot to say
She thinks the world is falling apart
But that's okay
She just wants to be happy
A place for everything
And everything in its place
I get better, wait and see
She amazes me
It's kinda hard to see in here
But there's nothing to see
So who cares?
Drank coffee all night and now I can't sleep
I think I opened a secret file
I let her look for a little while
And now I'm waiting for the ambulance to arrive
She just wants to be happy
A place for everything
And everything in its place
I had better wait and see
She amazes me
I couldn't understand the instructions
And the clock sounds like it's ticking slow
And this book is in another language
A language I don't know
I used to tie double knots
But now I couldn't be fucked
Things are getting stupider all the time
She just wants to be happy
A place for everything
And everything in its place
I had better wait and see
She amazes me, you're confusing me
You're confusing me

Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold

Lift you to your higher ground

And now what
For Yyou
What are you going to do?

Can't consume slowly
Too much to see
Too much to read
On your bridge to O.T.
But someone, somewhere is
Pushing a world around on four wheels
And tonight in your town
The stars are looking down
On you and me...

And now what
For you
What are you going to do?

The news comes twice a week
Like a Chinese whisper
Not the same when it reaches me
Safer to see than to be seen
Safer given lines to drive
Between, between, between
And it's such a small room
It's a danger
And the pictures on the wall
Might mean nothing at all
But they're mine
Will you notice, will you notice, will you notice...
What will you say
What will you say

Would not go unnoticed

In your sleep
Diving down to follow me
And you
In a dream...

Quiet words that spin around my head
Surrounding me
Fading down the waking world and then,
You know where I'll be
You know where I'll be

The money and the drugs.
Only looking for a little patch of green where the future never comes.

Ohh

I started walking,
I started walking through the birds and the drugs, 
Now I'm singing in the park.
I found you watching all the lovers walking around like they're glowing in the dark.
Over the city, 
Was the guys and the guns, 
The money and the drugs.
Only looking for somewhere else to be where the future never comes.

Inside the city,
Was these guys with guns, 
The money and the drugs.
I count my blessings for this little patch of green where the future never comes.",The Futurist

Welcome to the last minute
And we've spent it on a sound byte
A phrase, a well thought out line
12, 11, 10, 9
Carry it on your back
Hold it before your eyes
Breathe it in (x2)
And then say goodbye
You tore (x2)
You tore off all the wrapping and you didn't read the card
Tomorrow was a blessing and a gift
Not a guarantee not a new car
We left today breathing its last breath
Somewhere back down the line
This is the beginning of the end
Of the beginning of the end (x2)
Beginning of the end
Carry it on your back
Hold it before your eyes
Breathe it in (x2)
And then say goodbye
Say goodbye
We're getting warmer, we're getting closer (x2)
Getting warmer, getting closer (x2)
But you know
Time will come (x3)
And make a fool out of you and me
Some other time could we?

Something for Kate,"I took my time
And whatever else I could find
I didn't care at the time
I've got it all planned
I'm gonna mark out my land
I've drawn some lines in the sand
I thought time would change things
I thought that things would change
I thought you thought I think you thought
But everything is the same
I try to stay between your world and mine
But that's a crooked line
And I don't wanna look at you
And I don't wanna have to think
I'll blame the captain and the crew
'cause they said it wouldn't sink
They said it wouldn't sink
My legs won't hold me up
Your heart is pounding in my head
My mouth seems to be working against me
I don't wanna look at you
And I don't wanna have to think
I'll blame the captain and the crew

I've been waiting for this night all week
Green to yellow to red, the lights keep flashing inside my head
Could have stayed in but instead I got all dressed
I'm like butter and tonight's the bread
I feel incredible, and my friends all buzzed
Do it how they does it yeah just because
Stay up till five
It's so nice to be alive

The world is mine today
Keep dancing got the whole night left
Been a lot of places but I ain't done yet
All of us up in the clouds
We roll by, they say wow
See the world, we're on top
Spot a dope spot so we all just hop
Through the doorway
We're cooler than sorbet
Watching everybody sip their drinks

And the skyscrapers with big windows
Just lego pieces built to crash
Want to slow down life time moves too fast

Dance floor on it yes sir I kill
Chill cause the night is young
Room full of love, trying to get me some
I'm a wanna have fun type lady
Gonna find a cute boy just maybe
But if not then it's still all good
Had a great night and I knew I would
Behind the club is the cityscape
Got a lot to do, but it can wait
You never know how it might turn out
Stay awake till the lights burn out
Feeling faded, let the record play
Got a lot of work, but it's OK
Check the time and it's 5 AM
Tomorrow night I'll be back again
When I lose track of time

SoMo,"She wanted my heart,
Wanted my soul,
Wanted that loving
But I ain’t tryna hold on to her heart
To see it fold.
Girl’s holding on to the thought so tight
Holding on for her life
I just might have to give it to her,
For one loving night.
She whispers so slow
Said to my ear, “I love Somo.”
I said, “you just wanna get in my pants,
'Cause I’m ‘bout to get that dough.”
She says, “I like it fast.”
I say, “Why you gotta rev my gas?”
Next thing I know,
I’m standing in my front door tryna stop my hands

I just wanna take your picture
Go 'head stand there in the door
Let’s get naughty, let’s get naughty
Take your body to the floor
Take that thing and make it drop
Come over and show me more
Hold me softly, I’ll keep going
Till you’re screaming and you’re sore

And we live for that rush.
And we rush for that love.
And we love for that one
That just straps up your heart.
And you’re back to the start again
That just straps up your heart.
And you’re back to the start

She’s dripping to the core
Says to me, “can I explore
Your body, feeling exotic
And I just need a little tour.”
We start off just by touching
Then we go on to rubbing
She says “I’m on top
Let me ride.”
I say, “uh-uh, I’mma get that loving.”
I thought you could take it fast
Yeah, you like it when I slap your ass
Take it all, I’mma go deep
Keep it so sweet, one night to make it last
She’s close, I’m about to wrap
She can’t open up her eyes
I’m driving deep and her body’s so weak
And I can’t let go inside

I just wanna take your picture
Go 'head stand there in the door
Let’s get naughty, let’s get naughty
Take your body to the floor
Take that thing and make it drop
Come over and show me more
Hold me softly, I’ll keep going
Till you’re screaming and you’re sore

And we live for that rush.
And we rush for that love.
And we love for that one
That just straps up your heart.
And you’re back to the start again
And she prays for the love
So I stay and we run
Sends a wish on a star
Now just wraps up her heart
We were trapped from the start

So we live for that rush.
And we rush for that love.
Why can’t we",Back to the Start

SoMo,"Her fingers are cold on my skin
What is this hole that I'm in?
Taking my clothes off again
Feeling her warmth, but it ain't warm

I am stuck in this rut
Again caught up in this fake love again
I am feeling nothing
I am feeling nothing

What if we were blind
To the lives we left behind
What if we could rewind like a movie
I like the movies, yeah

I wish that I could feel again
That time with you was heaven sent
I wish that I could feel again
I wish that I could feel again",Blind
SoMo,"Head first, chest hurts, never thought it'd get worse
Head first, chest hurts, never thought it'd get worse

You say you hate me for what I did
But how can you blame me for choosing this?
Now everything's faster, more money spent
You think that I'm happy except I'm losing here

Baby, baby come back, you were the only friend
That seemed to see past all of that bullshit
I'm a reckless disaster, you're the innocent
It's like I'm on track, crash, I'm falling in, I'm falling in

Head first, chest hurts, never thought it'd get worse
Let the bottle pour it in, drown out all these mess ups
Let's just go back and the story replay
To that day that you prayed that I'd never stray away, oh no
Wish I never strayed away, oh no

You gave me an option, you let me choose
Believed in the music and what I do
But you wanted a promise, to stay true
Except that this ain't a contest, you aren't a fool

Baby, baby come back you were the only one
That's full of pain but so full of us
Stuck in this heartache like it's a drug
Relapse and I'm back, crash
I'm falling off, I'm falling off

Let the bottle pour it in, drown out all these mess ups
Let's just go back and the story replay
To that day that you prayed that I'd never stray away, oh no
Wish I never strayed away, oh no, oh no no no no no

Wish I never strayed away, never strayed away
Through with empty promises, I never should have made
Wish I never strayed away, never strayed away
Through with empty promises, I never should have made

What I traded, what I waited for my whole damn life
No debated, you were jaded, thought you'd be my wife
Whoa, whoa, and it feels like I'm crashing down
And it feels, and it feels, and it feels like I'm crashing down

Head first, chest hurts, never thought it'd get worse
Head first, chest hurts, never thought it'd get worse

Head first, chest hurts, never thought it'd get worse
Let the bottle pour it in, drown out all these mess ups

You know that feeling
That feeling you get when you're in love

When I wake up and you're next to me
Gotta pinch myself cause you're a dream
You're beautiful, you're heavenly
Then you wake up with that smiling face
I know that I'm in the perfect place
And you know that you're my saving grace

I do it all for you, I do it all for us
The stars in the sky can't amount to my love
Ain't no cloudy days, just sweet lemonade
You're the perfect addition to my every wish
And I pray for that day you come around
And I'll say, ""I do it all for you, I do it all for us
My heart is alive because of your love""

When you come home from a hard day
And I tell you that it'll be okay
It's so beautiful, it's so heavenly
Then you kiss my lips and turn off the lights
And you trust me cause I'm still by your side
And I say, ""Honey, I'll never leave you babe""

I do it all for you, I do it all for us
The stars in the sky can't amount to my love
Ain't no cloudy days, just sweet lemonade

Is all I have left now

No turning back

Forgotten words and hopeless heard
All left in the past now
Maybe it's for the best
Don't call it an angel's test
My heart has no fear now

But you'll always be a part of me
And I got this red lighter, red lighter
Got this red lighter, red lighter

All these thoughts are driving me insane
Memory of your eyes, hiding this flame
You can't take any of that away
Let it burn out, we're caught in the rain
Rain rain, rain rain rain

Even after the storm, the clouds are reborn but it's never been wetter
It must have been fate, two hearts didn't break, it's gotta get better
I'll keep these thoughts alive inside to remind me whenever
I'm down and out, I'll think about when you said forever

And you'll always be a part of me

La vi llegar a casa de Pedro
En un auto marron
No se si un nissan o un Toyota
Creo que fue a las dos
Parece que vio a un fantasma cuando saludo

Deja ese cuento ya
Ella es mi amiga solamente
Ya dejenme en paz
Solo pasaba por mi casa
Why quiso saludar

Como la nieve en verano
Cuando oye que alguien me dice
Que vas a regresar conmigo

En una casa que tenia su olor
Su ultima nota en la puerta del refrigerador
Nunca pense que para oir su voz
Dependeria d eun mensaje ya gastado en el contestador

Pero eres tu
La que el suelo me vio
Caer de rodillas con mi cruz de dolor
Pero en un segundo todo desvanecio
Con tus besos de amor

Pero eres tu, la que hoy pinta su amor
Con lapiz labial dibuja mi corazon
Junto a un te quiero que siempre adornara
El espejo del salon

Paso los dias lleno de dicha why de felicidad
Cada detalle es un evento nada de trivial
Es como ir tomado de la mano por el mismo Dios
Iluminas este mundo sin sentido
Que no alcanzaba el sol

",Pero Eres Tu
Son by 4,"El amor que yo pense que era genuino 
Era falso 
Tantas noches mendigando a su lado 
Un abrazo 
Orgulloso de la reina de mi alma 
Ignorando su papel aqui a mi lado 
Muy feliz, regando su veneno 
Why burlandose de mi 
Idolatra del amor, la pasion 
Es mi escuela 
Se antojaba de una estrella 
Why sin pedirla ya era de ella 
Olvido que fui quien rescato su vida 
Al levantarla de la ruina que existia 
En lo mas hondo why mas oscuro 
De su negro corazon 
Nunca imagine que eran espinas 
Lo que me esperaba 
Antes de mi ella no era nada 
Why asi me entregue 
Despues de la tormenta llega la calma 
Why asi es que es me niego a tu presencia 
Acaba why marchate 
Vete why no vuelvas 
Que ni siquiera pase por tu mente 
El querer regresar 
Vete, no te detengas 
Que tengas suerte 
Why que Dios te perdone por ser 
Tan poca mujer

Son by 4,"Perdona si te estoy llamando en este momento
Pero me hacia falta escuchar de nuevo
Aunque sea un instante tu respiracion

Disculpa se que te estoy violando nuestro juramento
Se que estas con alguien que no es el momento
Pero hay algo urgente que decirte hoy

Que estoy muriendo , muriendo por verte
Agonisando , muy lento why muy fuerte

Vida , devuelveme mis fantasias
Mis ganas de vivir la vida
Devuelveme el aire...

Cariño mio , sin ti yo me siento vacio
Las tardes son un laberinto
why las noches me saben
A puro dolor...

Quisiera decirte que hoy estoy de maravilla
Que no me a afectado tu partida
Pero con un dedo no se tapa el sol

Estoy muriendo , muriendo por verte...",A Puro Dolor
Son by 4,"Que te sucede, que esta pasando 
Que yo te noto lejana 
Si no me quieres, hablame claro 
Dime si ya no me amas 
Como la palma de mi mano 
Asi yo te conozco bien 
Entre nosotros hay un pacto 
Dime si lo quieres romper. 

Que te sucede, que esta pasando 
Que yo te noto lejana 
Si no me quieres, hablame claro 
Dime si ya no me amas. 

Como conoce el mar la arena 
Como mis labios a tu piel 
Tus ojos hablan, ya no mientas 
Yo se que algo no anda bien. 

Que te sucede, que esta pasando 
Que yo te noto lejana 
Si no me quieres, hablame claro 
Dime si ya no me amas.

Son by 4,"I fell in love with a beautiful Puerto Rican girl, and her name was Sofia
I met her in San Juan, and I knew she had be the one, mi nina bonita
Thought everything was fine when I looked into her Spanish eyes
How was I to know that she wasn't really mine
In her eyes, there was another guy that gave her amor
She couldn't see that my love was all she'll ever need
That in my heart she's the air I breathe
I feel her all over my body
Sofia, she's the love de mi vida
Sofia, and she's driving me crazy
Sofia, she's the love de mi vida
Oh, mi nina bonita
Sofia, and I know someday she's coming back to stay
I can see her every night in my mind as I fantasize that she's still with me
But I can't deny every time the sun rises, and I open up my eyes, I feel so lonely
Thought everything was fine when I looked into her Spanish eyes
How was I to know that she wasn't really mine
In her eyes, there was another guy that gave her amor
She couldn't see that my love was all she'll ever need
That in my heart she's the air I breathe
I feel her all over my body
Sofia, she's the love de mi vida
Sofia, and she's driving me crazy

When you look into her spanish eyes, you'll know what I mean",Sofia
Son by 4,"Cuenta la gente que alla
Bajando la calle luna
Cuando la tarde se va
Se va pasar a Sofia

Vestida de soledad
Con un rosario en la mano
Recorre el viejo San Juan
Pidiendo a Dios por su amado

Se le ve tirando besos al aire
Como si hablara con alguien
Pero a su lado no hay nadie

Sofia, el amor de Sofia
Va a volver algun dia
Va a volver algun dia

Lo se, Sofia enloquecio
Cunado su mejor amiga
La traiciono y se marcho
Con el amor de su vida

Sobre su pelo marron
Aun lleva el velo de novia
Alla en el viejo San Juan
Todos conocen su historia

Se le ve tirando besos al aire
Del amor haciendo alarde
Pero a su lado no hay nadie
Sofia, el amor de Sofia

Son by 4,"I'm sorry I didn't mean to call you
But I couldn't fight it
I guess I was weak and couldn't even hide it
And so I surrendered just to hear your voice

I know how many times I said I'm gonna live without you
And maybe someone else is standing there beside you
But there is something baby, that you need to know
That deep inside me, I feel like I'm dying
I have to see you, it's all that I'm asking

Vida, give me back my fantasies
The courage that I need to live
The air that I breathe

Carino mio, my worlds become so empty
My day's are so cold and lonely
And each night I taste the purest of pain

I wish I could tell you I'm feeling better everyday
That it didn't hurt me when you walked away
But to tell you the truth I can't find my way
And deep inside me I feel like I'm dying
I have to see you, it's all that I'm asking

Son Caribe,"You look in my eyes
And I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy
But you still can touch my heart
And after all this time
You'd think that I
Wouldn't feel the same
But time melts into nothing
And nothing's changed

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

Each day of my life
I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I
I'm not the desperate type
If there's one spark of hope
Left in my grasp
I'll hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning
To have a second chance

No, no, no, no, no, no I need you baby
I still believe that we can be together, no no
If we believe that true love never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again.

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream
You and me
Will find ourselves in love again

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again",I Still Believe
Son de Cali,"Dame aunque la sombra de un beso

Still trapped in a box tryna clear my name won't go away

That's like hypnotizing chickens
Well I am just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before
'Cause of a lust for life

Got a lust for life
Yeah a lust for life

Son of Dork,"My friend's a computer hacker
But in school everybody said he was a slacker
He writes science fiction novels
He builds whole towns and villages from cola bottles

He does equations just for fun
Eats low carb ice cream with his Mum
Sews Cub Scout badges on his sweater

He's just a feeling you ignore
A dumb computer hacker
Trash can on the floor
A pitiful disaster
Cried to sleep at night
When he never got it right
'cause he never realized
It doesn't even matter
Later on in life
He's drowning in his laughter
Three kids and a wife
He's happy ever after
Stoked to be alive
With his dream up at NASA
Loving everyday
Well, I guess it really pays to be a slacker

He stays up all night playing Tetris
Asteroids, Pacman written on his 'games to get' list
Wasted nights spent up in his bedroom
Tough times, long nights
Must have been a lot to get through

He's getting sharp pains in his wrist
In his world girlfriend's don't exist
Can't even get an ad on 'My Space'
(poor guy)

He's just a feeling you ignore

He's happy ever after
Stoked to be alive
With his dream up at NASA
Loving everyday
Well, I guess it really pays to be a slacker

He's the one all alone in despair
He's the one who thinks life isn't fair
He's the one sitting right over there
He's the lonely guy on the side
Looking kinda shy
You could see him ride
Passing by on a pedal bike
He's the funny type
Kinda like 'Napoleon Dynamite'

Son of Dork,"When I go to sleep I pray 
I'm waking up to I got you babe 
Like the guy from Groundhog Day 
Just wanna live forever this way 
Flash back to seventeen 
Got my ass kicked by the football team

Every Guy With A Chick I Fancy 

I asked you out for losing truth or dare 
The guys were cracking up 'til you said yeah 

Pinch me, is this real? 
I'm on a one way ticket out of Loser-ville 
Now I'm off the social flat line 
Things are so good that I'm 
Taking down my star trek shrine 
And you're more than just my valentine 
You're my ticket outta Loser-ville 

She gives me butterflies 
Says I'm not like all the other guys 
Doesn't care what car I drive 
She still enjoys the ride 

When I got to sleep I know 
That you'll be there tomorrow

Pinch me, is this real? 
I'm on a one way ticket out of Loser-ville

You blew me out on a Sunday night 
You were bored to tears pretending 
Knew what you wanted and I'm nothing like the 
Guy in your happy ending 

Well you were wrong to lead me on 
Now in the night I wake up screaming 
Where the hell did I go wrong? 
Where's Scotty when you need him? 

Pinch me, is this real? 
I'm on a one way ticket back to Loser-ville 
Heading for the social flat line 
Things are so that bad 
I'm dusting off my star trek shrine 

This is where it ends and I can taste the glory 
How can I depend 
On a better story? 
Made it, blew it, couldn't save it 
Think about her all the time 
It's like I never had her valentine 
So I guess I better kiss goodbye to my ticket outta Loser-ville",Ticket Outta Loserville [DVD]

Son of Dork,"It's summer, everybody's out
And you're right over there
I'm staring while you play around
With that pencil in your hair

It's sad in your eyes
I'm just one of the guys
I'm so into you, you don't have a clue
There's nothing you can do to stop me now

You got me falling
Through noticing the little things you do
Putting a hold right over me
Funny as it seem, you make me dream
Doing the little things, those little things you do

I saved up for binoculars
I bought them last weekend
To watch you playing badminton
With all your slutty friends

Maybe it's time I gave up, drew the line
My friends say I should
I wish that I could
But there's nothing they can do to stop me now

You got me falling
Through noticing the little things you do
Putting a hold right over me
Funny as it seems, you make me dream
Doing the little things, those little things you do

I call up your house
But I'm always outta luck
Keep hanging around
But that's never good enough

And you don't reply when I talk to you
I shout at you
But you don't blink an eye
It makes me wonder why

You got me falling
Through noticing the little things you do
Putting a hold right over me
Funny as it seems, you make me dream
Doing the little things, those little things you do

You got me falling
Through noticing the little things you do
Putting a hold right over me
Funny as it seems, you make me dream
Doing the little things, those little things you do, do, do

Doing the little things, those little things you do, do, do
Doing the little things, those little things you do

Son of Dork,"This song goes out to all the fakers
You all know who you are
It started with a girl
Kept turning her nose up at my band
She's into Yellow Card, Blink and Simple Plan

It's so pathetic

She's into Jane's Addiction
But she don't know their songs
And I fall over laughing when she tries to sing along
She thinks that she's so ""emo""
Next week she'll be a ""goth""
It all amounts to nothing
She gets murdered in the mosh

One night I crashed at her apartment
Her Sonic Youth cd's were nowhere to be seen
Instead, all I found was a letter
Her correspondence with some pop star magazine

It's so pathetic

She's into Jane's Addiction
But she don't know their songs
And I fall over laughing when she tries to sing along
She thinks that she's so ""emo""
Next week she'll be a ""goth""
It all amounts to nothing
She gets murdered in the mosh

Sometimes I wonder what goes on inside her mind
When she said she though
Dave Grohl had died and Kurt Cobain was still alive
Just go to concerts that you love
'cause there's no shame in liking Backstreet Boys

She's into Jane's Addiction
But she don't know their songs
And I fall over laughing when she tries to sing along
She thinks that she's so ""emo""
Next week she'll be a ""goth""
It all amounts to nothing
She gets murdered in the mosh

This song goes out to all the fakers
Out to the critics and haters
This song goes out to all the fakers
You all know who you are
Give it up
Your friends will find out
Now or later
Time foe change
Just be yourself
Don't be a faker",Murdered In the Mosh
Son of Dork,"Party's over
I just watched my girlfriend get laid on the sofa
Does that seem weird to you?
The guy was older
Heard someone say he got her clothes off playing poker
When I wasn't in the room
Can I assume this spells the end for me and you?

Morning after
I go outside and the garden's a disaster
The kitchen table's in the pool
The sound of laughter
Echoes on inside my mind, holes in the plaster
And I feel like such a tool
And so abused, don't think I've ever felt this used

And goodbye
Feels so sore
My relationship's over
I'm lost without a cause
I wonder why
She strung me up and left me hanging out to dry
Tell the guys, the party's over

It's complicated
Stranded at first base I never saw her naked
Now I'll never get a chance
I'm aggravated
When I think of all the precious time I've wasted
On another dead romance
The days go by, they fade away and so do I

And goodbye
Feels so sore
My relationship's over
I'm lost without a cause
I wonder why
She strung me up and left me hanging out to dry
Tell the guys, the party's over

And I can't get over
Face the fact, it's over
I don't know why I even try

It's so sore
My relationship's over
I'm lost without a cause
I wonder why
She strung me up and left me hanging out to dry
Tell the guys, the party's over

It takes a while to realise
Funny how the feeling dies
Don't wanna hear your alibis
For something you can't justify
There's nothing here for me to say
It's not for me to save the day

Son of Dork,"It's more than a habit
I'm more than an addict
I'm parked here outside of your door
Know you never lock it
Got your keys in my pocket
Lights all out
But I know for sure I am
Ten steps away from you
From you and him
Redemption, is that a sin?
I'd never run him over
I wouldn't wanna dent my car
I'd never rip your throat out
'cause that could leave a nasty scar
So I'm gonna go out
Get drunk with my friends
Try to get myself outta this funk
I'd never screw my life up
Because of how sick you are
You walk by the river
As you start to shiver
Two headlights are following you
As he pulls you closer
My engine's ticking over
It's my choice
To do what I do
Ten steps away from you
From you and him
Redemption, is that a sin?
I'd never run him over
I wouldn't wanna dent my car
I'd never rip your throat out
'Cause that could leave a nasty scar
So I'm gonna go out
Get drunk with my friends
Try to get myself outta this funk
I'd never screw my life up
Because of how sick you are
I'm talking 'bout a split decision
Made in anger you know
I'm talking something that could change my life forever
Is it worth it? No
Is it worth it? No
Should I stay here and watch the show?
Or maybe it's time to go
I'd never run him over
I wouldn't wanna dent my car
I'd never rip your throat out
'Cause that could leave a nasty scar
So I'm gonna go out
Get drunk with my friends
Try to get myself outta this funk
I'd never screw my life up
Because of how sick you are",Sick

When I woke up today

Shut off like the radio

You speak only fiction
All day you criticize
I can't be around your bitching
I've got no room in my life
Your friend's feeding you ammunition
Why don't you realize
You're so different when you're with them
All their words are lies
Won't hang around

Son of Dork,"Eddie kick started his career
One Summertime in May
A shitty band with friends from school
But only he could really play
The moment that he took the stage
The fans were blown away
I always knew that he'd go far
I'm glad I lived to see the day

Eddie's got twenty-seven kids but he 
Doesn't know
Shame he'll never be around to 
See them grow
Said he screwed a different girl
After every show
But he was always way too gone
To remember though
So Eddie doesn't know

At 3a.m, it's getting late
The after party's closed
But everybody follows Eddie
They just won't leave him alone
Calls seven girls to his hotel room
Takes off all their clothes
Some people say he had it easy
But that is just the way it goes

Eddie's got twenty-seven kids but he 
Doesn't know
Shame he'll never be around to 
See them grow
Said he screwed a different girl
After every show
But he was always way too gone
To remember though
So Eddie doesn't know

He's in deep and there's a reason
He's all alone and he can't change
Like the seasons
They come and they go

To all the kids who don't look
Like their Mum and Dad
Don't freak out, don't you let
It make you mad
As long as they both love you then
You should be glad
Just think about the little problem
Eddie had

Eddie's got twenty-seven kids but he 
Doesn't know
Shame he'll never be around to 
See them grow
Said he screwed a different girl
After every show
But he was always way too gone
To remember though
So Eddie doesn't know

Eddie's got twenty-seven kids but he 
Doesn't know
Shame he'll never be around to 
See them grow
Said he screwed a different girl
After every show
But he was always way too gone
To remember though

Been looking for providence and watching for a sign

Why all the mortar, bricks may crumble
Time moves along
With a dance step stumble
Really no choice
But escape from the past,
Wake up the silence
Make it clear, make it last

Throw this love down the highway
See where it turns
Life is a shell game
Lessons lost, lessons learned

[Chorus: x2]

Throw this love down the highway
See where it takes you",Down the Highway
Son Volt,"We tried to guard but stayed through life
Others were trying but all is true

‘Cause it can’t go wrong, we can’t go right

[Chorus]
Though our hearts and minds don’t waver
Waiting for love
That sound of danger

Circumstance, left to chance
As we move around safaris did burn
Tears gone down, so we wait around
Waiting for two to run
Making our days, living this way
So much to gain, so much to lose

Can ever change your mind

Know it’s hard to your easy start
You don’t let the clicks or injustice get you down

Sometimes the furthest isn’t quite enough

"Son, Ambulance","His liver damaged in the wreck
The windshield shattered
All for an instant fleeting like cars from the street
Cat tops spin across the highway and horses die in backseats

Don't blink now
I know I can't talk man, but I understand
Any way I look at him my love, you've got to come back soon it's not fair
They choke your neck with a seatbelt that meant to help

Break it apart
Misunderstand me
Flash this evening on the sky screen
Drive to Vegas and get yourself hitched

If I live through my imperfections - two glass decades and you're still angry - I don't want to be your friend anymore
We turned a wheel that raised a wall and made this living world turn red
But I'm not scared
I pulled my arms from the fence where I leapt

Violet...
Like rain returning (...Violet...) back to the earth from a cloud
Falling down makes you squint as it hits your glasses lens
I set a trap, caught myself

So I surrender
That's what I did
It wasn't there
No, no, n-n-no, it wasn't there

I looked, I looked
I looked everywhere
The girl I lived for Saturdays she watched this brilliant star grow faint
But it's not there - It's not there

I made this light to give to you
No matter what you do
I've been storing up these words to pour like rain like peace upon your perfect head
Illuminate you, stardrenched lover

I surrender

A necklace that you had tied (She tied it)
Before that night I drowned you in a reservoir

And all the world a twirling top - it will be yours to stop",Violet
"Son, Ambulance","There's a voice on the phone
Telling what had happened,
Some kind of confusion
More like a disaster.

And it wondered how you were left unaffected,
But you had no knowledge.
No, the chemicals covered you.
So a jury was formed

As more liquor was poured.
No need for conviction,
They're not thirsting for justice.
But I slept with the lies I keep inside my head.

I found out I was guilty.
I found out I was guilty.
But I won't be around for the sentencing,
Cause I'm leaving

On the next airplane.
And though I know that my actions are impossible to justify
They seem adequate to fill up my time.
But if I could talk to myself

Like I was someone else,
Well then maybe I could take your advice,
And I wouldn't act like such an asshole all the time.

There's a film on the wall,
Makes the people look small
Who are sitting beside it,
All consumed in the drama.

They must return to their lives once the hero has died.
They will drive to the office
Stopping somewhere for coffee,
Where the folk singers, poets and playwrights convene,

Dispensing their wisdom,
Oh dear amateur orators.

They will detail their pain
In some standard refrain.
They will recite their sadness
Like it's some kind of contest.

Well, if it is, I think I am winning it,
All beaming with confidence
As I make my final lap.
The gold medal gleams

So hang it around my neck
Cause I am deserving it:
The champion of idiots.

But a kid carries his walkman on that long bus ride to Omaha.
I know a girl who cries when she practices violin.
Cause each note sounds so pure, it just cuts into her,
And then the melody comes pouring out her eyes.

Now to me, everything else, it just sounds like a lie",Going For the Gold
"Son, Ambulance","Love is real
It is not just in novels or the movies
It is fact
And it is standing here right in front of you
So if you open your eyes
Oh what a sweet discovery
There is hope, and there is joy, and there is acceptance
So now let all of the light that collects on your plants
Keep you warm, make you smile
And I will be there with this pen in my hand
To record all the while
You'll be laughing so loud
That the house would shake with sound
And everything will be as new as the day it was found
Love is real
It is not just in long distance commercials
Or something that you thought you felt back in high school
So I will turn black and white
Become that horoscope you're reading
It predicts something good is on its way
Oh, and then I will send you the world green and blue
In a box through the mail
You can open it up, hold it right in your hand
And be glad that it's there
And be glad that you're there
Now, you can feel all the knots in your stomach start to untie
And suddenly it's not so hard to say you're all right
Love is real
It is not just in poetry and stories
It is truth, and it will follow you
Everywhere you go from now on
So if you'd just cast off your doubt
Then your lips would answer for you
Oh my darling, when you smile, it is like a song
And I can hear it now
And I can hear it now
And I can hear it now
Yes, I can, I can, I can
I can hear it now
I can hear it now
Yeah, I can, I can, I can

"Son, Ambulance","It was in the march of the winter I turned seventeen
That I bought those pills
I thought I would need
And I wrote a letter to my family
Said it's not your fault
And you've been good to me
Just lately I've been feeling
Like I don't belong
Like the ground's not mine to walk upon
And I've heard that music
Echo through the house
Where my grandmother drank
By herself
And I sat watching a flower
As it was withering
I was embarrassed by its honesty
So I'd prefer to be remembered as a smiling face
Not this fucking wreck
That's taken its place

So please forgive what I have done
No you can't stay mad at the setting sun
'Cause we all get tired, I mean eventually
There is nothing left to do but sleep

But spring came bearing sunlight
Those persuasive rays
So I gave myself a few more days
My salvation it came, quite suddenly
When Justin spoke very plainly
He said ""Of course it's your decision,
But just so you know,
If you decide to leave,
Soon I will follow""

I wrote this for a baby
Who has yet to be born
My brother's first child
I hope that womb's not too warm
'Cause it's cold out here
And it'll be quite a shock
To breathe this air
To discover loss
So I'd like to make some changes
Before you arive
So when your new eyes meet mine
They won't see no lies
Just love.
Just love.

I will be pure
No, no, I know i will be pure
Like snow, like gold
Like snow, like gold
Like snow, like snow
Like gold, like gold, like gold","No Lies, Just Love"
Sonata Arctica,"Mamas put your babies to sleep, story too cruelsome for them this is. 
In Junior high she said goodbye to her parents and ran away with a boy. 
She left her family warm and kind, all of her friends said 
""you´re out of your mind"". 
Life of her own she would find, it´s Monday and she´s gotta grind.

A Job as a waitress she sure was to find, beautiful face, mind of a child. 
Boy got her pregnant, Mary-Lou cried,"" 
For this I am too young 
Oh why did you lie"" You said ""it´s okay if we do it today"", 
I was so scared that you would go away. 
""Despite all the papers been signed, 
Mama take me back be so kind"".

Only a child, reckless and wild, needs to come home again. 
He promised the moon but won´t marry you. 
Nothing to do, eating for two, he´s goin´ out with someone new. 
Sunshine or rain, it´s all the same, life isn´t gray
Oh Mary-Lou.

Mamas do your children still sleep, 
In the safe of their cradles so sweet. 
Story I told you I have forseen,

Sonata Arctica,"Winter in here ain't as cold as they say
We have nature, yes, we know the way
accommodation in the lap of the nature
Can give you a moving response,
If you have the time

Violate the law of the wild, see her lose her temper
Drink the wine from her stream
Have a time, she's there for thee

Build the campfire in a place you know safe
And then see that you put it out right
Can you see trail of garbage in there
Maybe not, and that is a sign to follow

Violate the law of the wild, see her lose her temper
Drink the wine from her stream
Have a time, she's there for thee

You are still the number one
Wilderness, my soul
We may have or lose it all
Respect the wilderness, Respect the life
Save the nature for your unborn child

In the summertime we have night with no night
In the winter she will hide the light
Over the hills, hear the call of the wild
You have yearning to get there, Lapland, madness

Violate the law of the wild, see her lose her temper
Drink the wine from her stream
Have a time, she's there for thee

You are still the number one
Wilderness, my soul
We may have or lose it all
Respect the wilderness, Respect the life
Save the nature for your unborn child",Respect the Wilderness
Sonata Arctica,"A lifetime ago, with frozen eyes they closed the door
Suddenly I realized what locks are for
No trusting them anymore, lights are out

Empty the stare, innocent and unaware, dragged out from my home ,my lair.
Earmarked me, hurt me, burned me.

The walls around me, eyes surround me, feed my fear again
I must be freed or I will die before the harvest moon, my friend
I do not have another year in me, you've gotta set me free

The dream is alive, I can run up the hills every night
Go around and see another side of the tree
Freedom has a meaning for me, howl with me

Fear in the dark, I advice you
You can not see the eyes, they grow behind
you
It's my song they now sing to you
You stand no chance

They'll kill for me, steal back my freedom, set me free
It's my minions versus thee
Fiery the vengeance, hate will drain me

The walls around me, eyes surround me, feed my fear again
I must be freed or I will die before the harvest moon, my friend
I do not have another year in me, you've gotta set me free

The dream is alive, I can run up the hills every night
Go around and see another side of the tree
All I want is to be untamed and free, howl and dream

The dream is alive, with the moon on the hills every night
Run around and see another side of the dream
Freedom has a meaning for me, you can't tame me

You will remember the day you crossed my path
Leave me without a guard and you feel my wrath
What you have done to me has made me bitter and cruel
I'll see that all the hate you spread returns to you, you, to you

The walls around me, eyes surround me, feed my fear again
I must be freed or I will die before the harvest moon, my friend
I do not have another year in me, you've gotta set me free

The dream is alive, I can run up the hills every night
Go around and see another side of the tree

Sonata Arctica,"I am your poison candy gram
The love that's meant to fade away
(Vade retro, alter ego)
Move aside I'm choking on this life
I think I tolerate your hate
As long as you're afraid
All I wanted was to be with you and suffer every day


Under the moon I hold a wake for a promise torn
Mortally wounded, feeling sheltered me
Once again my shadow will enter your life
Time to walk with me the last mile

I read the book about a man, the love, the women, how they die
How I was waved aside, listen how the headless doves cry
I truly see a madman in the mirror when I'm weak
I spent a year in love before I realized it's me


Open your blue eyes tell me that you love me, whore
Make me believe it, oh I know you're lying
Broke the vow I thought you made my angel why
Could I let you wait out the night

Mother always said: ""My son, do the noble thing""
You have to finish what you started,
No matter what, Now, sit watch and learn
""It's not how long you live but what your morals say""
Cannot keep your part of the deal
So don't say a word, don't Say A Word

It won't be long now love, like mist I slowly feel the room
I place a black candle on your chest
The path of night its manifest
I never wanted us to end up in this catatonic phase
It wasn't me who ran away, you made me stray

Open your blue eyes tell me that you love me, whore
Make me believe it, oh I know you lie
Broke the vow I thought you made my angel why
Setting the score, we pass the twilight

Mother always said: ""My son, do the noble thing""
You have to finish what you started,
No matter what, Now, sit watch and learn
""It's not how long you live but what your morals say""
Cannot keep your part of the deal
So don't say a word, don't Say A Word

Strawberry blonde your stranglehold
On my heart is bound to end
I suppose, life sometimes
It doesn't go the way it was meant.
Though you never were a believer
I assure you, I won't die before you.
You read the book now,
The part ""ashes to ashes, dust to dust""

Short is the flight of this little sparkle
Love sounds familiar, but the emotion escapes me
I will carpe the diem while it's still here
And see how the fear of death becomes her

We had it all so sweet
Made for me, you, indeed
Big secrets, small the lie
Don't cry for me, oh, argentite

No words you say tonight
Can make this be alright
I'll help you follow through
Remember this?: pacta sunt servanda

The wounds are to deep
I need to keep the scars
To prove there was a time
When I loved something more than life

Unlike the last time here
I now have the means and a will sincere
Your knight is nowhere near
Unfortunate for you, this make me your God

Closing your eyes, don't ever say you love me, whore
You never meant a word, I know you lied
When there is life there is despair,
Indulge me now and stay alive this night
I promise you the end before the first light arrives

Mother always said: ""My son, do the noble thing""
You have to finish what you started,
No matter what, Now, sit watch and learn
""It's not how long you live but what your morals say""
Cannot keep your part of the deal
So don't say a word, don't Say A Word",Don't Say a Word

But this world is imperfect too,
And that just has to do

I am my own medicine,
Turned into a poison

I think I gave you a lot,
And not enough, I know
Tortured myself, same as you,
Without losing my sanity.
Where's my applause?

I see no reason to live in Hell.
How can life make me feel so incomplete?

I had a weakness and my walls came down
My tears won't reach the ground
Burn my new wound

I know I cannot feel regret for anything
If I was numb, I'd end this once and for all
I feel the burn, still

I cannot face this day, my guards are down
I cannot love myself, weak, sad clown

I see myself, my fading colour
I see no hope there, where I always used to,

I fear your words, the things they mirror
Maybe that is all I am, just a reflection, please help me

I see no reason to live in Hell
When you smile, you make me feel incomplete

But it's all ending, the clock's rewinding
We don't mean anything to me. You think?
I killed this silence for us to make things right
The words are loaded.

Once connected,
One torso, one head
One solid reason, the pain
If love's the neck, kept us together, and apart
Now it's broken

There is no cast, no real salvation
When it is broken, it will stay that way
Believe me when I say this
I would not if I did not care

Tears don't mean anything
If we don't know when we're sorry
No one will win today we can't play this game, this way

We cannot soar and still stay on the ground
Don't wanna see me, hear me, hate me

""Hate, hate, hate""

Jealousy's a phantom,
Something that was never, ever meant to find me
But now its pale green eyes have destroyed everything

You know how it must hurt, and I know,
There is nothing you've done to deserve this.

Apology's a policy,
Sometimes it really has to be, it's kept me afloat thus far

This sure nuf's one nice
Loose noose, perfect times
Are we happy in this hell?
Is there someone who can measure
Whose pain is bigger?

It all has ended, the clock's re-winded.
We don't mean anything to me. You think?
I killed this silence for you to end the night
The words are loaded

Unprotected, one torso, no head
One valid reason, the life's suspended
If love's the neck that kept us together, and apart
Now it's broken

There's no cast, no real solution
When it is broken, it will stay that way
Believe me when I say this
I would not if I did not care

Who needs who, when and what the hell for?
Who wants to suffer and be hardcore?
And who's strong enough to peel off the dead skin

I cannot face this day, my guards are down",The Dead Skin
Sonata Arctica,"The premonition

Remember when I told you how my
Kin is different in some ways?
And how you should not fall in love
With someone like me, anyway
Between the lines, people see signs
When they feel the sear, every day's fear
And one night their torches
Find the girl without a name
And the one who has her
Love is no more safe

And until I get my peace I'm but a shade

(The witch-hunt)

The sun lit the white mountain's snow covered peaks,
There I see you, amongst the good people, suffering
She is the one, the unwanted, decidedly so,
'Cause she makes our children cry.
It's a fact, she is exactly that!
A harbinger of death from the world of witchcraft,
And she's feeding them cakes and her ale to this innocent boy,
And her magic brings dismay

(Exposing the heathen)

""I hear her in the wind, the bane of our town
Come with me, father, I'm to expose a heathen""

In my home town
No one's safe now
Young love's been forbidden
For five-fold kisses, my only love had to die

(Envy)

""Your crops are all flourishing, so what's the catch?
I know what you are, the new evil unhatched
As sure as the dawn, they will hear what I know,
And recognize you, and you'll be cleansed too""

(The fear)

For the good, trusting people in town,
In their fear stricken hearts,
Seeing skyclad's a sign like the deathaura,
Every night, so painful's the memory of love in the dark.
One wheel of the year ends their short lives in fear

""I hear her in the wind, the bane of our town.
Come with me, oh, father the heathen is exposed.""

(The grudge)

In the age of burning times, you saved my life
The blaze grew ever higher.
I was your cunning man, hiding in the light,
Now your land shall go sour

Your own fears will destroy everything
Envy consumes all, and ""thou shall not""
Though it hurts, I must tell you
""I am truly the one
Behind it all""

(The curse)

In the hands of time we all will die
The dead of night will devour your child
The creation o' beliefs you've been fed
The fear, the unknown, the poison loved by death.

(The flames)

In the cool of the night air
Flames purify minds, where
Almost anyone could be the next
""Unless morning finds all of them somehow hexed""

(Endless inquisition)

(Together, today, for all eternity)

I remember how you told me,
Your kin's different, on that sunny day?

You made me smile,
'Cause I was just about to say the same thing
So deeply entwined, love of a lifetime

But they paid someone to say their torment has a name
And after all these years we get to be together for all eternity",Deathaura
Sonata Arctica,"Tonight my life will lack it's meaning
One final step before we're seeing
For once I am happy my little friend
Cannot comprehend what we are seeing

No words are needed, only a gaze, embrace
Contact the living, remember the dead

There is always something to learn,
Repetition proves it's worth
Without those moments, we would not remember

It's not fair, it's not fair, there was a time now
Kneeling down, take in the moment when
Everything becomes finally clear.
It's not fair to lose it,
And how, there was a time now
But Death is cheating us somehow

Come here now

Can't walk away, nothing to say
No need to feel so afraid,
Colours last a lifetime and fade to grey

It's not fair, it's not fair, there was a time now
Kneeling down, take in the moment when
Everything becomes finally clear.
It's not fair to lose it,
And how, there as a time now
But Death is cheating us somehow
And he's already here.

""When it all ends""
When everything fades to grey,
We dive into the darkness
Some things are needless to say

Somethings are needless to say,
We dive into the darkness

Sonata Arctica,"In the days when lands were few,
And man sometimes had no chance
But sell his soul to his landlord to make a living
In far and away country,
They gave acres of land away for free,
To all able to claim it
Ships sailed across the great seas,
Fortunes were made and dreams shattered
Sometimes couples were torn apart,
For all they could afford, was one ticket.

Leaving my life behind
My young love and the unborn
Only have a lock of her hair
And burning love inside

After forty work-filled days and sleepless nights,
The sails are lit by the lights of Boston
And here we go
Off the ship! towards the adventure,
The one to define our lives.
Daily grind and a tiny room.

I got here safe, love.
I have an address, until spring, then I shall race for the land,
Hope to hear from you soon

Her letter reads

Please let me know everything's alright
Thinking about you, though you're out of sight
Every night, when I'm turning in, my tears find me.
Please hurry, dear, come back and rescue me

Now that I have made the dollars we need for the dream.
The best horse I've ever seen,
A carriage and everything I need
I will make my way to the great unknown
Every moment I wish you were here with me now

Please let me know everything's alright

No, I'm not a stranger, among the people in here
Yet I have never felt so alone
At high noon the sound will boom,
And I will start racing for the
Land we can call home.

I stuck my
Flag in the ground, screaming 'n shouting,
I've never felt so proud, love!
We are free from eternal serfdom!
I'm gonna bring you home, my light!

Nine, eight, seven, six, counting the days. solo!
Five, four, three, two, together forever! solo!

I made my way into the great unknown
Land by the river, and a new built home.
I am the land and the land is me
Freedom is everything and we are free

I made my way into the great unknown
Land by the river, and a new built home.
Every night, when I'm looking at the full moon rising
I hold you and know that we are free",Flag in the Ground
Sonata Arctica,"In my eyes you're a giant,
The keeper of all the keys,
Different but compliant
A God for someone like me

Learned to read what you're thinking
Suffering every moment left alone
Tamed the beast deep within me
Sleep in peace friend, cause I am guarding

When I'm not howling at the bright new moon
The burning flame within, my own kin, and
Every night I hear something out there calling me
Reminding me, friend, to know, that I'm not your child

I follow when you lead, and do what you command,
But there is something that is out of my hand
It's my own nature, appetite, I am a creature of the night

I am howling at the bright new moon

Bright new moon, brings the light in my life
One more day and you must let me go

Here I am howling at the bright new moon
The burning flame within, my own kin, and
Every night I heard something out here calling me
Reminding me, friend, to know, I'm not your child

I am howling out there
At the bright new burning flame, within my heart
Every night I hear something out there,
Telling me I'm not your child",In My Eyes You're a Giant [*]
Sonata Arctica,"These are my final lines,
I've lived all my nine lives,
My nights are over, cannot feel your heart anymore

I lived only trough you,
My scar, my heart, my truth,
I do not want to die,
But no more can I love you!

How hard it is to understand
My wish to die hand in hand?
This night's like a dream
You will be the last thing I will see

I hold your hand, close my eyes all I love finally dies
Drank the poison most foul with you
But why do you smile?

Don't smile
Don't you smile
You're supposed Wither away with me, so, Juliette
Please don't smile
I'm paralyzed and you are still alive.

Life is but a long, sad game
Lifeless souls, avoiding shame
Two dead swans is all what we need
To pave the winding memory lane.

No hellos, no bad goodbyes
Wailing, distant, silent cries
You can live with my pain,
It's your own you cannot take?

You played the game and lost,
I wonder how you can,
Hold the cards for a dead man

The light and the clarity
Welcome change for the life in the darkness,
Sea of my sanity

Lost in the vanity
All I ever wanted, to be lost in you,
My burden, the hatred

My own reality
Mirrors and smoke
The final truth unfolds

Your reality
Mirrors my hopes,
Where you will need me

They never find us again once the trail has gone cold
They never find us again once the trail has gone cold
I'm a restless soul, I'll make the best ghost
All things good end into a

Minute of silence!
I get myself in line
One minute of silence
To face my own demise
One minute of silence
This is not what I signed for
One minute of silence
You double-crossing, filthy whore

I sit with someone in the dark
I'm so afraid to see it's me again
You had a change of heart,
Now we're all getting hurt

Ladies and gentlemen,
Welcome to my life again
Walk with me, every curve, every bend
This promenade that seems to come to an end

You know what you meant to me,
Emptied the room in your life that I paid for
When I lost my sanity
I made a mess I am now here to clean

It is too late to regret anything tonight
After what has come to light
You have played me for a fool, for all this time?
The story may rewrite itself after I'm gone
One more breath, the day will dawn

How hard it is to understand
My wish to die hand in hand?
These wounds stay open all night long,
You are the last thing I will see

I lived only by you,
My scar, my heart, my truth,
My sole reason to die, for
There's no life without you

These are my final lines, I've used all my nine lives,
My life is over, cannot feel your heart anymore

I lived only by you,
My scar, my heart, my truth,
Have no reason to live,
I can't feel the love anymore

This is, the end
Why?
You're closing my eyes",Juliet
Sonata Arctica,"The mystery of death before us
Soon every night can bring the light, and close my eyes.
Sometimes life in here is too limited
Sometimes we don't care at all.
Sometimes

Time will change the familiar face.
Brightest colours fade to grey
The fear is real, one winter's day brings the clarity.

I feel the time is catching up with us
How many days until its hunger is satisfied?
Leaving the final golden days
We are the last amazing greys
Hoping the young will lead the pack now.

I can feel my heart is beating, still
I can see you with my eyes, I still see.
But I can't run the way my children can
Can't accept the helping hand, leave me
You are the strong one, trust in me
You must lead instead of me, now
There's no time, don't hesitate
Or you will also find your fate.

I feel the time is catching up with us
How many days until its hunger is satisfied?
Leaving the final golden days

Life is just a phase.
I close my eyes and see them all here beside me.

Sonata Arctica,"My dream, it seems, fails to see the mornings
My one and only aim
I hear you breathe, I'm not alone in the darkness
I feel something on my lips I should not

One, too many poison kisses
And I'm drowning in the deepest see
I found my destination, what I'm here for
I'm knocking on my heaven's door

One day we will run out of tomorrows
And yesterday's become the stuff our dreams are made of

Until today, I lived in the shadow world
Now heart is speaking, brain's defeated

If your heart can hear a song, you can't go wrong
So repose your trust in me, save this love, live and see
If the life beyond this dream is what you seek""

""Fill your deepest wishes,
Come take my poison kisses
Life is too short, this golden hour lats for a lifetime""

Help me dream again, somehow kiss me now

I try to make a deal (with myself)
To avoid the blinding door (once again)

The party's over, the flies are back,
Unexplained. Mean and bad.
The deepest wound, still no scab.

Full HD sci-fi scream,
The time is out, mind is clean, it's blank
I'm missing a little time

I found a truth beneath the lie
Buried deep, explain me why
The world is upside down
I do not know a soul in here,
But I can remember the faces
And the truth is in their eyes

Say g'nite and welcome the day
Cannot see hues,
So that is why the greys wear green?

I don't like this state of mind
I can see, but I can't find it,
Horrified to see what the following two days will bring

Can I trust my own eyes?
Is that me in disguise?
Is this bliss or am I insane?

Found the thin red line of madness
Far from the Skyland Mountain

I found a truth beneath a lie
Buried deep, explain me why

I can't wake up anymore (not anymore)
I've seen how this will end (oh it will end)
Don't want to soak anymore

The truth is out there.
Somewhere between two fairy tales,
Caught somewhere deep between someone's truth and a lie

Another really rainy morning, it's a perfect day
I'm too tired to be hypnotized now
It's all to real for me anyway

While you dwell in your hypocrisy

Sonata Arctica,"Yeah!
She got a shitload of money
The night´s a mile high deja vu
Taking her wings and halo down to boom town, yeah

She got a shitload of money
When the night is over
She walks away no wings, no halo

There's an angel with no glory
There´s a book without a story
Wings road stained will now descend
Teary smile to rip your heart in two, yay

It is an ordinary day dream
To save an angel, be her plaything

But now you know

She got a shitload of money
Shiny wings dark sky
All chains only glorify freedom

Nobody knows how she got it (what she´s got)
She got a shitload of money
A fallen angel paid for her halo

Underhanded, they are falling
All the trump cards they are folding
Oh, the greenback days are over now
Lady Luck took off with her new love

""I´m never
In for the penny, but always in for a pounding when I'm playing
Put your mouth where my money is, the world is now for sale, hon!""
So many open mouths, one silver spoon

She got a shitload of money
Shiny wings dark sky
All chains only glorify freedom

Nobody knows how she got it (what she´s got)
She got a shitload of money
A fallen angel paid for her halo

Shitload of money, shitload of money, all gone, yeah.
Shitload of money, shitload of money.

She got a shitload of money
Shiny wings dark sky
All chains only glorify freedom

The neon-light lit night
She got a shitload of money
A fallen angel paid for her halo

She got a shitload of money
Shiny wings dark sky
All chains only glorify freedom

She got a shitload of money
Shitload of money
She got a tale to spin but no halo",Shitload O' Money
Sonata Arctica,"Hold me when I´m standing 
When I´ve fallen, we´re disbanding 
You are so goddamn beautiful, but 
Unstable, your joke got old. 

Sick one trick pony 
You fed my fire, 
Now I´m rising ever higher 
And the red ripples multiply as 
Reflections rise from the sea 

From the sea 

Take away the pain inflected on me 
The hunger you´re letting me feed 

I bleed my rust on the roses 
That once have chained us, me to you 
Your dying love is a rose 
I will bury somewhere close to you
When we are dancing 
I hear worlds, you're still fading 
I feel safe, yet unsatisfied 
Soaked in trance and disgrace 

You are so jaded, keep me sedated 
With your nonsense, deeds and phrases 
And if suns still set in your eyes 
You get to see my face glow 

Take away the pain inflected on you 
The hunger you´re letting me feed 

Bleed my rust on the roses 
That once have chained us, me to you 
Your dying love is a rose 
I will bury, somewhere close to you 

You bleed your rust on the roses 
That once have chained us, me to you 
Your dying love is a rose 
I will bury somewhere close to you 

I bleed my rust on the roses 
That once have chained us, me to you 
Your dying love is a rose 
I will bury somewhere close to you",Somewhere Close to You
Sonata Arctica,"Sometimes we find things we're not looking for
And we lose the sense of reason
Sometimes we lose what we are caring for
And then face the day without them

My life, my home, my you

Sometimes we fail to say how hurt we are
When the word we fear speaks treason
Don't wanna be there when my cupid dies
From a wound by his own arrow

Here's to life, my hope, my you

I raise a glass and drown my sorrow
When I'm on my own
I dry my eyes on a shoulder
But it's not my own

I cannot hold you
My tears are made of stone
I feel a tap on my shoulder
But tonight I dance alone

I raise a glass and drown my sorrow
When I'm on my own
I dry my eyes on a shoulder
But it's not my own

I cannot hold you
My tears are made of stone
I feel a tap on my shoulder
But tonight I dance alone",Tonight I Dance Alone [*]
Sonata Arctica,"""Hello""

So here I walk up the road back home,
This place is me, my skin, blood and bones
You'd have to remember in order to fear me
""Your past will now burn down your town""

There is a mountain, in the horizon
Rebuilding the fire, the flames are arising
I am the flint and the kindler they need

This is where we used to live
You were scared. You all were.
You cast me out, all for one, family.
You draw my blood, they will burn down your town

There is a mountain, in the horizon
Rebuilding the fire, the flames are arising
Strong is the fear, and the anger it breeds

I can take all the blame, for the sake of my name
Our blood on your hands, running hot in my veins
They say ""Do yourself well and stay away from your family"" what?

Build a wall on the hill and write a book out of fear
Then aim a gun at your son to keep him safe from us 
You´re not foolish, you're insane. They would die for me. Twice.

Build a wall on the hill, write a book out of fear
You are out of your minds, blind; your love´s the killing kind

Children play,
Your riddles and games
Are hurtful, this pains me to know, they will teach them to fear.
But if anything, they teach them to hate
The bells of my fate play my songs, 
But I don´t want to dance anymore
But I don´t want to dance anymore
Cause I don´t want to dance with fire!

Love is the infinite power
You´re gonna sing when the mountain tells you,
Now, you'll sing, you'll bow, as we dance around you
In a dream, you believe, you have seen our soul,
You have seen our heart,
You have seen through the wall,
You have seen what we are,
But what have you learned?

I can take all the blame, for the sake of my name
Our blood on your hands, running hot in the veins
They say: ""Do yourself well and stay away from your family"" what?

Build a wall on the hill, write a book out of fear
Aim a gun at your son, keep him safe from us 
You're not foolish, you're insane. They will love me till death

Build a wall on the hill, write a book out of fear
Aim a gun at your sons, make them all read it
You are out of your minds, your love is the killing kind

Write a book about us, family infamous
Memorize every leaf, every word, every phrase
See your name on the last page
Consumed by fire

The bells of my fate play a song, but I don´t want to dance anymore
But I don´t want to dance anymore
Cause I don´t want to dance with fire!

The innocence slain, the price you have paid
So tonight, if you teach your own children to hate
Remember to tell of both heaven and hell
Never open those gates for the weak

Because we're up on the mountain
We are one with the mountain
Cause we are the mountain, one with the Mountain
Wildfire Mountain
Wildfire","Wildfire, Pt. 2: One with the Mountain"
Sonata Arctica,"You didn't come in peace, wear a flower in your hair
Didn't mean to harm anyone of us in here
You need what you take, like a candle needs a snowflake

The roots are alive and the bodies will rise
You can try the same, but you'll never have a dice
Waging a war to a mountain; death, eruption

Know that if Mountain wants you all begone, thou wilt be gone

You bring in the machines ""fire in the hole!""
Money is the power, morals gotta go
Tomorrow comes and the law is not a problem.
Corruption.

On every standing nail a hammer is to fall
No value in the oddities, evolution's gone
Talk is cheap but the suits are not

Thy will be done, thou wilt be dead

You dig another hole in the one you´re standing in
Nothing is enough for Generation Greed
Angels die for the cause, long live the faction

If you have access, ""it is fine to reave!""
You only destroy to be able to leave
This planet one day, what a perfect day!

Thy will be done, Thy will be done,
Thy will be done, thou wilt be dead.

Fiat iustitia, Pereat Mundus
Tulkoon oikeus, tuhoutukoon maailma

Seen so many of you die, thy will be gone. Yay!

You are wasting your life, use a pen as a knife
Always wanna take more than you ask for
All your promises reek, gluttony makes you weak.
Our planet is ever so grateful,
Grateful when your offspring´s gone, done!

Gomorrah be gone, revolution, a new spin
You don´t wanna dance in the ballroom you´re in
Mountain gives no hope, line up to die now.

You are in a battle you´re not supposed to win
Still you run to your death, face it with a grin
Run home, kids, while you still have homes

A place where you learn about harmony and peace
These you never knew, wish you would, but never will
It's in your blood, but your blood runs thin

The Mountain still wants to believe, you can turn the page again
You lose your hope here, one by one
Listen to me, son, you've got nowhere to run

You are not perfect at anything, least of all in things we were always good at

Slow to learn, you are slow to learn, children grow and burn, 'cause you'll never learn

Thy will be done, Thy will be done,
Thy will be done, Thy will be, Thy will be
Thou wilt be dead.

Species, generations. Extinct? Evolved?
What you call progress, must be put on hold
To let you have your way is not an option

""Using his burgeoning intelligence,
this most successful of all mammals has exploited the environment
to produce food for an ever increasing population.
Instead of controlling the environment for the benefit of the population,
perhaps it is time we control the population to allow the survival of the environment.","Wildfire, Pt. 3: Wildfire Town, Population: 0"

Mit hang zur Toxochromanie
Und immer wieder der Grund
Für Mamas Tränen im Gesicht

Doch ändern kann ich's nicht
Ich war bei jedem Scheiß dabei
Und warf zu oft den ersten Stein

Kannst du dich erinnern
Es war ne durchgeknallte Zeit
All die krummen Dinger
Das meiste tut mir nicht mal Leid
Denn obs den Andern gefällt
War mir immer scheißegal
Ich war immer ich selbst
Zwischen Wahnsinn und Moral
Denn ob richtig oder falsch
Ich konnt' nur selten Widerstehen
Bis hier kein guter Anfang
Wo's endet wird man sehen

Sondre Lerche,"Down in the valley you're close to the sun
But we're heading closer as close as can come
So you said you have to put some truth into your words

Down in the valley, inside your mansion
You won't have to speak to express what you feel
But I said you know how it feels but not what to do

It doesn't make sense how you can leave the ground
And enter the sky and stay there too

And these fools share my opinion that flying is crazy too

Is it all make believe?
Don't abuse the trust I place in you

If I should bend and break
You force me to walk and wait
No one will wait for you
'Cause you never asked them to

If a moment you got caught
You'd stop and see it's enough
Even you are not complete

Is it all make believe?
Tell me now make believe
I'm a tent of paying you other pegs

If I should stop to breathe
Just to get over it
I wouldn't wait for you
'Cause you never asked me to

If a moment you got caught (passed you by)
Deny and reveal your lies
Even you are not complete (not complete)

For a moment just retreat
Tonight you lie down defeat
Even you are not complete

When you live in paranoia and you know she's got you, oh yeah
You can't leave until you know the truth
So for months you're going nowhere 
Until you seize the day and place yourself behind the steering wheel 
Or you could end like you don't want to, the opposite of what you planned to:
You can watch the ships when they're abroad
Become a joke when people see you, cause it's enough to please you

Nothing has been lost",It's Over
Sondre Lerche,"Let it go, everyone's bound to know that I've lost you again
This time you wound up with someone else
Your own will let me down

Put your arms around me
For the first and last time
And say sincerely that you'll keep me in mind

'Cause time won't wait 
'Til it's too late
To find out who you were
If you had let me make 
One honest mistake 
I'd try to change your mind

I try to set an example for all of those who blame their luck
You seem to know where you're heading now
I know this and that's not much

Tell me all the things that you never dared to say
Say you're glad you told me
That he isn't going to stay

'Cause time won't wait 
'Til i's too late
To find out who you were
If you had let me make 

One honest mistake 
I'd try to change your mind
We've sent letters out there
But you don't care

You know you'll manage alone
We've sent letters to you
They never get through
'Cause you'll get by on your own

If you are to change your mind
Don't think I'll forget where I have been
I'll stay 'till this torment's over
And I know not where I'm going

Make 
It
Easy
On 
Me
Please

I have no choice but to let it go

Sondre Lerche,"You have been waiting all your life
You use your patience to stay fine
Time moves on as you prepare
To tell yourself be reasonable
Then come the times you can't foresee
You cannot leave, you can't release
To keep you far from those dreams
Ignoring the right times
Oh, waiting was my life

For now it's too late
For you may not wait
And things that I have yet to know
Vanish before they're complete
I may turn around
To see if you're still there
But as for now, it's just not safe
Maybe you'll wait for me
Maybe you're gone

You've been preparing all your life
You've had some trouble getting it right
And you try to tell yourself it may work,
As it should
But something good can do much harm
The good may kill for your embrace
To keep you far from those dreams
Tou know you cannot dream
I'm stuck for now, it seems",Maybe You're Gone
Sondre Lerche,"If that's a tear I see
If it's because of me
Then I may well have to
Tell you what I would do

But to play is easier than to set the groove
And to think is more simple than changing the mood
Is it more, is it less?
What's that thing on your chest?
Won't you whisper your blues as heartfelt as you can?

Meet me halfway
By the bedrock
On the tower

If I translate you wrong
When I complete your song
That would be my two feet
Stumbling ahead of me

I could tell you the tricks that I think hurt you best
About the house packed with people and their loneliness
But the hour is so late
Take some weight off your chest
Let's just pray for our fates and then give it a rest

Meet me halfway
By the bedrock
On the tower

Go get yourself up straight
I'll throw a melody
That is as serious as it is simple

On the tower
On the tower
Meet me halfway
By the bedrock
On the tower",On the Tower
Sondre Lerche,"All alone in pink
All the carpets fade to grey
Amplifiers burst out the deal that I have made
What's there to say 
I cannot say by myself?

Thinking about writing it down seems pretentious
And helplessness may be the word they nail to my name
In a while

[Chorus:]
Stupid memory
Must you bring up these things?
Stupid memory
Can I forget all of that?
All of that crap

All embarrassment
In addition to the talk
In each crowded court there's a spot 
Where I fall in love and short
On public demand
There are no words they can't hear

[Chorus]
Stupid memory
Must you bring up these things?
Stupid memory
Can I forget all of that?
All of that crap

I think I forced a smile upon her mouth
I know I dreamt that, hollowness aside
Everyone's a winner if the stadium is right
But rarely anything good comes out

Sondre Lerche,"Down came the sky
And all you did was blink
I would cry like I never do
In order to stay true
But everybody has their own opinion on such
They're all much alike 
Alike, alike
One hundred of a million is worth penning dead down
So why am I writing to the moon?

Down came the sky
To whack us to attack
While we cried in between our cheeks
I was red and bleak
We often joke it's over 
But it's never enough
I take it you are afraid
Afraid of everything I am 
And of some things, I am not
A fear I share before I go to bed

When tears are pretzels pouring 
Down each time 
The sweetness is returning
At times when you appreciate 
That you survived

Tricks tend to track you down
Even when you're high
It's the reason they made 
It all easier
You'll never know the hit
Tricks they track you down
Tricks they track you down

Down came the sky
And everything went black
I saw you
You saw me
And you were naked
Which was weird
But in that space in time 
We played the strangers again
In oceans of oh I see, I see
When my words lost their meaning 
On their way to your door
Yours lost their way out of your

I don't want to want you to go
But I think you've left me 
Without options
Things that you should know by now
That I never told

Tricks tend to track you down
Even when you're high
It's the reason 
They made it all easier
You'll never know the hit
Tricks they track you down
Tricks they track you down",Track You Down

Won't you listen and I'll let you in on this
Blind me!
As you listen I'll reduce advice to dust
Oh no!
I shouldn't have to spell my name

Ma!
If it's worth the made up smiles, the quiet fights
Oh mother!
It is hard not to look in the mirror's eye
I have come to this while you have come along
So it's alright if you change your mind the other way around again
I shouldn't have to spell my name

So start the two way monologues that speak your mind
We're talking two way monologues with words that rhyme

We
can't reclaim the shirts we threw away last twirl
Uncurl the note-in-pocket, personal brochures that dust
Machine-washed, that's how paper rusts

Days you spend wanting some of Michael Landon's grace
strike back, now they shape your life as stony as his face
Oh no! I shouldn't have to spell his name

So start the two way monologues that speak your mind
Start the two way monologues with words that rhyme
Start the two way monologues that speak your mind
We're talking two way monologues

We were chasing rabbits on the hill
And that prairie-life was great, but never real
'Cause we never saw no rabbits out there, ever, no, not once
All we did was put a fire up and watch it burn for months
And I miss the sound of stairs and walls and maladjusted doors
and too little space for holding all the soldiers and the war",Two Way Monologue
Sondre Lerche,"Wet ground and the snow is still not falling
Circumstances are alarming, darling
The future is just a word, that's how I recall it
The past is much more present in our yawning

But I heard you right
Something was lost from the start
Oh babe, what should we do, what should we say?
Should we give it away?

The future looked so bright then
What happened tonight?
Now aeroplanes are crashing
Who turned out the light?
Seemingly it seems to me I'm subject to a joke
And it's not a test

Wet ground and the stars are still out shining
Neon lights were never oh, so blinding
Prosecute the ones who stand accused
Let the others go or leave them dying

But I heard you right
Everything was here before
We shouldn't add or put away a thing
Let nobody win

Whether we will win or lose

Just let him know what he should know
Don't fool around with him no more

Is it just for boys with cars?

Mexico or Milan.
If you want my opinion,
I have one and a million.
All I ask is you come back in time.

Well, you know what you want
And the ticket says where to find it.
Then there's no point in starting
And approach with some barking
May I ask you to come back in time?

I will volunteer to serve your brave attempts,
To listen while you chant,
To hold your microphone,
To serve what I resent.

You are hard on yourself.
You say no very well.
Making plans for the others 
Make them shine for their lovers.
I just pray that you plan to come home

We fainted in the same position.
Floating proves to be suspicion.
Our laws don't have night vision.
Just reason free from passion

And I can never question you,
As long as you're around.
And you're always around

I will volunteer to serve your brave attempts,
To listen while you chant,
To hold your microphone
To serve what I resent.

You make it sound so easy,
Like Steely Dan, not cheesy.
And I can never question you.
You're always there to make the rules
But never there to break them.
In fact 
I better write down
'hoisting the flag.'

You should go if you want to.

Is there something I should read?

Wearing shimmering clothes
Is the world worth its spending?
Is that world worth me defending it?
How should I know?
There are calls to make with numbers I don't trust.

John, let me go!
I can't conjugate myself
If investigation fails, I'm on my own

When the coward sits alone again
When you've spent your feathers up
Making sense is made impossible
Making you detect my aim

I've seen this before

Sondre Lerche,"There is romance
And there is love
There are reports of a heart-robbing beauty whose victim I know
I can't hesitate or wait
'Cause I don't speak that language
I don't know that tone
I can't translate from right to wrong
I can just call it love
Yes, you heard right
I call it love

There is romance
And there is love
That seems to be the only system that they know of
But why be satisfied with only love
When there are games you should know of
Such as romance and turtledoves
Who wonder if it's love
I wanna call it love

Can we dance instead of walking?
We wanna break in to love's industry
Lie down where it's machinery slows down
When we've danced our socks off and it's late
We'll lie down to anticipate forever

When we romance
I feel a part
Of the loveliest human creature that I know by far
Who stays away from other boys
'Cause she knows where she's life or death or love
Where she is thought so highly of
Where someone calls her love
I wanna call it love

When we dance
Darling explosions!
We are chemistry without chemicals
A constant chain outside us both
Remember!
I've never felt so right before
And chances are it could be so
Can we dance instead of walking?
We wanna break into love's industry
Lie down where it's machinery slows down
When we've danced our socks off and it's late
We'll lie down to anticipate forever

There is romance that changes its course
Or just sad statistics I answer with anti-remorse
When I am satisfied don't tell me so
Just let me go on and on and on
And as I wake up by your side
I'll know that it is love
Or at least I call it love",(I Wanna) Call It Love
Sondre Lerche,"I never thought of heaven as a relevant spot

And I who thought there wasn't more

You knocked me off my feet
You knocked me off my feet
Heaven is from where you have come
Now I know

I never thought I could reach out from under the stream
I never hoped to ever be a part of a dream
So if it can't be, the stories I'll tell will shelter me from a future in hell

I just had to hear you once again

The days go by
Getting there and as I do
I know your days go on
While I'm living for a set of six songs

The night makes me feel so young
That's a routine I think you mean we've become

Sondre Lerche,"You can tell me anything
You are a true exception in my life
It sounded like she said she was in love
I then told her all the things that I had though I better keep inside
All of which revealed I was in love

All I craved was the rest but that's a priveledge non-existent 
When the word is out and about

You think it's gonna settle down in a stable environment once you both know
But it isn't so when you're in love
If it wasn't for the fact that I couldn't go back 
I wouldn't stand the torture that they call being in love

It won't get better
It won't get better
Embrace the curse so it doesn't get worse

Contemplating everything while doing nothing
On the verge of tears just because you are somewhat in love
I don't wanna be afraid and worry in the shade about the end
When I should be out being in love

But I'll need some proof
Won't you treat me to a dose?
Although I know so well
I can't tell

It won't get better
It won't get better
Embrace the curse so it doesn't get worse

How does the wind howl?
I can't defy it
It's nothing to do with me
It's just another dead end mystery

I'm not crying
I'm not crying

When the late, last caustic days approach somebody so immaculate
Rain will pour and violins may sound from rooftops that touch the sky
But I'm not crying
To terms with such a trying destiny

How does the moon shine?
How does the wind howl?

You can't not win!

Oh darling how I miss you
I'm just the mere shadow of my former selfishness
I crave the silhouette of your kiss
With only the blue light of the TV on
Lip reading threats and false alarms
There's a boy somewhere holding hands with himself
And a girl in a window on the Reeperbarn
Whenever I put my foot in my mouth and you begin to doubt
That it's you that I'm dreaming about
Do I have to draw you a diagram?
All I ever want is just to fall into your human hands

With the kings and queens of the dance hall craze
Checkmate in three moves in your heyday
But the girls don't listen to your line anymore
Now you're part of someone else

On the factory floor and you still say ""where's the action?""
Now you manufacture happiness
And get sold on the cheap for someone's satisfaction

(Chorus)
All you toy soldiers and scaremongers
Are you living in this world sometimes I wonder
In between saying you've seen too much and saying you've seen it all before

Tighter and tighter I hold you tightly
You know I love you more than slightly
Although I've never said it like this before

It's the breaking of the waves that were about to really carry someplace
It's a major minor detail
It's a solitary sequel to never knowing anything at all

It's the ticking of the clock when you wake up alone at seven AM
It's the thought of getting used to something so right and then just throw it away
It's a major minor detail
On a misty morning L train
And the fear of having to go back

You'll hear the piano sound
And know something turned around

It's the circus I bring on whenever I reach out to touch you my dear
It's the laws of our attraction and the fact that it's all going somewhere
It's a major minor detail
Like erasing that old ghost train
So one day I can be with you

You'll hear the piano sound

You ran away as the pendulum swung

And uptight like a metronome
You should've stayed 'cause that winter was long
But by dawn you were gone

That I was alive

From sleeping in too long with you

My hands are shaking
From carrying this torch

My head is where
It's always been
If only I'd know where

My feet can't stand
That ground no more
It seems that I don't care

My hands are shaking
From carrying this torch
From carrying this torch for you

My lips are bleeding
From kissing you goodbye
From kissing you goodbye every night

My heart is pounding
Yes, yes, yes
My mind just second guess

My love is so
Articulate
But I am such a mess

Well, I've had a name for it for some time

Oh this could be trouble
After all, after all

And I say is it a dream like it was back then
Is it a dream like it was back in the stars
Could I be so wrong? Could I be so wrong?

Chew every word to prevent what I know
From slipping right out of my fingers
Out of control, I don't know where to go
'Cause you were my map when I found you

Somewhere it's midnight out there

You sing your heart out to a tune
Hoping you'll never grow old
Hoping you'll never grow old

I know it may take some time
To get this day off your mind

Sifting through all the remaining files
Counting down all the remaining miles
Drifting off into a different night
Paralyzed by all the warning lights

Waking the patient satellites
Sleepy benevolent eyes
Heavily drunk on distant love
They never once misplaced a call
I hope they never grow old

About girls that I've seen
Very few reach beyond

No one makes me so weak
And appears so unique
In a cluster of freak
She is all that I seek

No one makes me confused
And so certain I'd lose
I'm battered and bruised
I'm disheveled but true

Sondre Lerche,"My baby's building a sand castle
And someday we're gonna live on the shores
But nowadays we just hold our breath
Until the meeting next Monday

And it's going through the roof
We're blowing through the roof
If only you guys could see us

Me and my baby we bicker but I know the talented devil inside
And so we bond over raising toasts
To absent minds, who paint the sky
Two absent minds, expecting to fly
My baby does tend to contradict it's only natural

That it's going through the roof
B-blowing through the roof
If only you guys could see that I'm giving you the proof
I'm telling you the truth
They were gonna call tomorrow

Tow absent minds, expecting to fly
My baby knows how the world goes around
We'll jump the rails and abandon this town
Sometimes I blush when imaging
How big it's gonna be

Really, really, blowing through the roof
We're going through the roof
If only the world would follow I'm giving you the proof
What do I have to do to make sure you all believe us?

Sondre Lerche,"It's a travesty, where do I begin?
The ways in which I have behaved
I'm glad no one was keeping track of me

Like the tambourine, driven by the beat
I forgot what time it was
I wish someone were looking out for me

Some of you may think that I regret some of my doings
I'd do it all again if I had the chance

Just like Lazenby
Can I do it over?
Don't I get a second try?
Every time I messed up my lines and stumbled
Just like Lazeny

Like the swirling sun, I haven't burned out
It's better to... etc.
I won't bore you with these things we tend to say

Like a fairytale, with blood on every page
My failures brought about some blessings
Someone must be watching out for me

Even though I wonder why I did some of my doings
I'd do it all again if I had the change

Just like Lazenby
Can I do it over?
Don't I get a second try?
Every time I messed up my lines and stumbled
Just like Lazeny

Just like Lazenby

Burning every bridge
Endless opportunities I squandered on the way to this event

And reluctantly begged forgiveness

Somewhere in a house across the sea
Maybe in a distant memory

Out of nowhere

Now you wait against the current in
Our old bay

Shimmering underneath the sea
Sentimental echoes spark my memory
Hard to make believe nothing means anything to me

Rehashing the wounded patriarch
On a tattered throne with a broken heart
From a home where you don't earn your stripes
You have to demand your rights
But you'll never win

Flickers a poor stubborn light

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

And every lonely sad mistake
Every change and interchange we make

SONiA,"Once riding in old Baltimore, head filled,
Heart filled with glee
I saw a Baltimore an keep looking straight at me
Now I was eight and very small
And he was no whit bigger
And so I smiled but he poked out his tongue and called me a nigger
I saw the whole of Baltimore from May until December
Of all the things that happened there
That's all that I remember

Who's so scared
When I was fourteen I took a bus to San Francisco
I was full of hope and joy till this girl called me a boy
But I was already on my way so frightened to be gay
Just like in 1942 (1492) the world screaming,
""Something's wrong with you, Jew""

Who's so scared
But what I discover,
Lover after lover
There's nothing wrong with me
That's just a lie by society
So I start looking at the world we have
And while it's not all bad,
There's a lot of room for improvement
People of color and the gay movement

Who's so scared
Won't you explain to me that pain of your life",Who's So Scared

We never seem to lose control 
When other people fall apart 
Our love just seems to grow and grow 

People ask me 
Why I always wear a smile 
They don't seem to understand

Every day of my life 
I'll never love another man 
Our love is better 
Better than ever 
And it keeps on growing stronger every day

They'd like to see us fall apart 
But we are stronger, so much stronger 
Cause love's delivered only from the heart 
And he'd call me 
If I'm ever on my own 
Because he knows it means a lot to me 
He's understanding 
If I need to be alone 
That's why I'll never set him free

That something has survived and you feel it too

I'd find the answers
If I was strong enough to work it out

It feels so unreal.

Am I better off all alone?
The truth is more then your brain can handle,
I won't hate you anymore.

I knew there was still hope for me.
Now share your brain so I can upload some hate,
If you saw me now would you pray for me?
Still I'll keep doing the same mistakes.

Once lost, now be embraced
Despair, love is for no one
Despair, time is on my side now

And when you dream of a new light
You came across the original me
You could tell me who he really was
But now it's all lost to you, new time

The way you live, the way you learn, new life
The more you speak, the less we believe
Once more you learned a lesson
You're involved in trouble and drawn back
Whoever's missing, involved, unknown entity

Sentenced to carry the weakest
Just had them under my wings
Declare, intercept my mind
Declare, hope won't save you now

Even if it never matter
You met the copy cat of me
Who corner the original
Now can you save me from myself?

Did we make it?
Are we there?
High and make me numb
This is not a love affair

The music of the years gone by.

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

I cannot see

I am in the darkness

Enough to make a butcher out of the bone

Sonic Youth,"Falling out of sleep, I hit the floor
Put on some rock tee and I'm out with the door
From Bowery to Broome to Greene, I'm a walking lizard
Last night's dream was a talking baby lizard

All comin' from hu-man imagination
Day dreaming days in a daydream nation

Smashed-up against a car at three A.M.
Kids just up for basketball, beat me in my head
There's bum trash in my hall and my place is ripped
I've totaled another amp, I'm calling in sick

It's an anthem in a vacuum on a hyperstation
Day dreaming days in a daydream nation",Trilogy: Hyperstation

Sonic Youth,"Hey Joni, put it all behind you
Hey Joni, now I've put it all behind me too
These times can't add up, your life is such a mess
Forget the past, and just say yes

Tell me Joni, am I the one
To see you through?
In this broken town can you still jack in
And know what to do?
I remember our youth, our high ideals
I remember you were so uptight
That time in the trees, we broke that vise
We took some steps and now we can't think twice

Tell me Joni, am I right by you?
Tell me how you're gonna lose this hard luck?
Hey Joni, when will all these dreams come true?
You'd better find a way to climb down off that truck

Shots ring out from the center of an empty field
Joni's in the tall grass
She's a beautiful mental jukebox, a sailboat explosion
A snap of electric whip crack

She's not thinking about the future
She's not spinning her wheels
She doesn't think at all about the past
She thinking long and hard about that wild sound
And wondering, will it last?

Kick it!

Hey Joni, put it all behind you
There's something turning, it's turning right to you
My head burns, but I know you'll speak the truth, hey!
Hey Joni, put it all behind you
Hey Joni, now I've put it all behind me too
Forget the future, these times are such a mess
Tune out the past, and just say yes

I get tense""

""Thurston, Watt, Thurston!
I think it's ten-thirty, we're calling from Providence, Rhode Island
Did you find your shit?
You gotta watch the motin' Thurston, your fuckin' memory just goes out the window
We couldn't find it in the van at all, we wonderin' if you looked in that trash can
When we threw out that trash, man, was the bag in your hand, did you dump it?
Call later, bye""",Providence [Live][#]
Sonic Youth,"Rain King ensures there's nowhere to go
It's jetstream, daydream, cocksure hard-luck show
His lips a fountain
His daylight sparks
He's a shotgun, schoolyard, streetwise, white-hot kid
Little whip-cream, phone call, breakdown, Rain King fist
His mind a countdown
His daydream sparks

I need three years to clear these thoughts, hey
I like to say I knew one true thing
It feels like years and all I've done is fought
And not turned up anything

Little black, take roll and roll, over my bed
I'm waiting here for some reality crease
There's one big-dead end in my head
And not a moment of peace

Crossfire, Rain King, with his Cadillac, kid
Marries every dictionary from his train-yard bliss
His lips a fountain
His daylight sparks
Scattershot image kick forging the real, when
Keeps a steel drum, wedding ring, Pontiac doorknob ten
His mind a countdown
His daylight sparks

Hung up on a speed king nation, caught up on a nail
Hanging tight with time, at least, a little while
Your sister is a beauty when she's naked, like my kid
I'm here in this world, cool world, dreaming of a peaceful kiss",Rain King [Live][#]
Sonic Youth,"To the extent that I wear skirts and cheap nylon slips
I've gone native
I wanted to know the exact dimension of hell

Fuck you, are you for sale?
Does 'fuck you' sound simple enough?

But he was candy all over

Come on down to the store

Come on down to the store

I grew up in a shotgun row
Sliding down the hill
Out front were the big machines
Steel and rusty now, I guess
Out back was the river
And that big sign down the road
That's where it all started

Come on down to the store
You can buy some more, and more, and more, and more

Everybody's talking 'bout the stormy weather
What's a man to do but work out whether it's true?
Looking for a man with a focus and a temper
Who can open up a map and see between one and two?

Time to get it before you let it get to you
Here he comes now, stick to your guns, let him through

Everybody's coming from the winter vacation
Taking in the sun in a exaltation to you
You come running in on platform shoes
With Marshall stacks to at least just give us a clue

Ah, here it comes, I know it's someone I knew
Teenage riot in a public station, gonna fight and
Tear it up in a hyper nation for you

Now I see it, if you've got, leave it, out of the way
Now I come near you and it's not true, why you make away?

Looking for a ride to your secret location
Where the kids are setting up a free speed nation for you
Got a Foghorn and a drum and a hammer that's rockin'
And a cord and a pedal and a lock that'll do  for now

It better work out, I hope it works out my way
'Cause it's getting kind of quiet in my city head
It's a teen age riot to get me out of bed right now

You better look it, we're gonna shake it, up to him
He acts the hero, we paint a zero on his hand

We know it's down, we know it's bound to lose
Everybody's sound is around you
Everybody wants to be proud to choose
So who's to blame for the stormy weather?
You're never gonna stop all the teenage leather and booze

It's time to go 'round, a one man showdown, teach us how to fail?
We're off the streets now and back on the road on the riot trail
