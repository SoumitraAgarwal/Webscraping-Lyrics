But I don't want that, so I should go where LL stay, huh 
To find that cutie with that nice fat booty 
So I can do my duty, and she will smile like Tudy 
From the Facts of Life that used to be on NBC 
However recently you've got to catch the repeats G, uh 
Back to the issue at hand understand I am a man 
Who can burn you like a fryin pan, more dangerous than quicksand

C'mon with Bass because I've got lots of pull 
Don't fabricate, he ain't straight, I'm an is, he's an ain't

Never de too much, never de too much 
Never de too much, never de too much, such, and such 
Type of words bein spoken 
When you ride the train you must have a token 
Four o'clock in the mornin', I was awoken 
And there ain't no jokin', when the pussy hoes are open 
The previous rhyme I told him, was stolen 
Lick my colon, sell you out like Colin, Powell 
Whoa ha hah, like that and

Count Me Out,"What was it that we used to say?
Was it that we would never change?
Can you look at me, the same and tell me nothings changed?
When I can look at you and tell that I couldn't be more right
Now there's just one word in my mind

Betrayed! For placing too much trust in hope, again
When you got close enough to know
That my heart got in the way again
So much trust lost, in all the words you never meant
Can you look at me the same and tell me nothing's changed?
I know I couldn't be more right, right!

What was it that we used to say?
Before betrayed
Betrayed! Betrayed!
What was it that we used to say?",Betrayed
Count Me Out,"I, I never thought that
I'd see the day that you would break apart
And when,
When did depression
Find a way
To break your fucking heart
With unanswered questions

When there's no reason for the sudden change
Things may never be the same again, yeah
You've got to take control
I've got to catch myself
Before I fall apart again

Show me there's something more
Than upset and regret
Show me there's something more
Than crashing into the end

I can't decide
I can't decide
Is it worth that much to you?
As much as this means to me
I can't decide
I can't decide
Is it worth that much to you?
Or just nothing

Count Me Out,"One last time
I took a look at what I once lost
Another part of me that's gone
It's too late to turn back

I tried to look ahead
And couldn't turn away
After so much has gone wrong
I never thought I'd have to say

Can't see a difference
Through all the promises
And the lies
There were the moments that we had

To me that always last
I've tried to put it all behind
When I'd give so much to get back
Take me back

To a different place
Unbroken by yesterday
These words so far behind
I never thought I'd have to say

Can't see a difference
Through all the promises
And the lies",Permanent

It's way too far to go

When I try to go to sleep
And they're always watching
I see fallen angels
As I'm walking in the streets
Silently preparing
For what they'll do to me

You see, I'm kinda paranoid
My luck, it seems to have run out
So I will point the finger now

I will hold my head up high,

Because it's my time to shine shine, Shine shine.

I don't let things get to me,
I want to live stress free,
No one, and nothing gonna get the best of me,
Believe in myself no matter how hard things may seem,
I'm clamming to the top,
My dreams will in reach, (Ohhh)

Count Red Hastings,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine

Count the Stars,"So what's wrong with me, I can't sleep
Pull these bedsheets over me and let me be
With broken hearts and black and blues
I' m shivering because I wondered what you'd think
If I didn't break and made a change for you

It feels like
The first time
That I am standing on my own,
And I'm not wasted tonight, not wasted tonight

It takes a part of me, can't you see?
I'm pushing through your tidal waves, so I can breathe
With no regrets, so bittersweet
I'm holding on because I waited for your call
If you care at all, I will wait for you

Where I can get release, but you can't understand

With no way to hold my head

And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H club, both active in the FFA
After graduation 
Mary Anne went out lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town and all she found was Earl

It wasn't two weeks after she got married that 
Wanda started gettin' abused
She'd put on dark glasses or long sleeved blouses 
Or make-up to cover a bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce 
And she let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order 
And put her in intensive care

Right away Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta 
On a red eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand as they worked out a plan 
And it didn't take 'em long to decide

That Earl had to die, goodbye Earl
Those black-eyed peas, they tasted alright to me, Earl
You're feelin' weak? Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl
Ain't it dark wrapped up in that tarp, Earl

The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats and said, thank you ladies
If you hear from him let us know
Well the weeks went by and spring turned to summer 
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person who nobody missed at all

So the girls bought some land and a roadside stand 
Out on highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham and strawberry jam 
And they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause

Countdown Dance Masters,"A lonely mother gazing out of her window 
Staring at a son that she just can't touch.
If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side, 
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much.
But all the praying just ain't helping at all, 
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble.
So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how,
Another body laying cold in the gutter.
Listen to me.
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
But I think you're moving too fast.
 
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation, 
But he just can't see.
She give him loving that his body can't handle, 
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me.""
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror, 
But he doesn't recognize his own face.
His health is fading and he doesn't know why.
Three letters took him to his final resting place.
Y'all don't hear me.
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
But I think you're moving too fast.
 
I seen rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not on God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
But I think you're moving too fast.

Uh huh sure you know you look kinda familiar.

Yeah you do to, but I just wanted to know do you know somebody named?
Oh you know his name.

Oh yeah definitely I know his name.

Well i just want to let you that he's mine.

Huh no no he's mine!

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

Think its time we got this straight
Sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man are you insane

But see I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But your blind if you can't see
That his love is holding me

See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make it
Through the day, Ain't that a shame

But maybe you misunderstood
Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All my love was all it took
(The boy is mine)

Must you do the things you do
You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know its me not you
And if you didn't know it's cause it's true

I think that you should realize
And try to understand why
He is apart of my life
I know its killing you inside

You can say what you wanna say
What we have you can't take
From the truth you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake

When will you get the picture
Your the past I'm the future
Get away it's my time to shine
If you didn't know the boy is mine

You need to give it up
Had about enough

You can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel

What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special place that's in my heart
He was my love right from the start

Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts of men who need more than they get
Daylight deals a bad hand to a woman who has laid too many bets
The mirror stares you in the face and says,""Baby, uh, uh, it don't work""
You say your prayers though you don't care; you dance and shake the hurt
 
Dance, boogie wonderland. Ha, ha, dance, boogie wonderland
Sounds fly through the night; I chase my vinyl dreams to boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
All the love in the world can't be gone
All the need to be loved can't be wrong
All the records are playing and my heart keeps saying

Is one I don’t intend to cross.

And it seems that most are still content.
Where most are comfortable accepting insignificance
we strive to find the effort within

You we be exposed to a world as cold as those who are left to populate it

I'll fucking be here until the end of time

I've watched everyone around me jump ship
and I hope they're left to sink
The current will carry us
I am proud of all that I've become
and I'm well aware that I have steered myself in the right direction
And life is yours to destroy
I just can't respect your decision
I would rather isolate myself than be a walking definition of travesty
I watched you do away with everything
I watched you do away

I would love nothing more than to watch this world swallow you whole
You were the catalyst for your downfall
But where the rest have failed
we are bound to succeed
And mark my fucking words

we will overcome, we will overcome

It pains me to admit that I held you in such a high regard, 
As if my life would mean nothing without your approval. 
But now I see the error of my ways. 
All that time spent searching for myself in someone else. 
I think it's safe to say that I've become everything I wanted to be. 
And no one can take that from me.

A doctrine bathed in ignorance, and written in the blood of the enslaved
And I have never lost my faith, I just never had any to begin with 
I would sooner die for my sins, then pray for my forgiveness
Sew my palms together, and crucify the thoughts in my mind
Awaiting Armageddon. Neglecting to exercise the demons in your head
You’re born again, but you’re better off dead

Conversion or a casualty, renounce and save yourself 
Is the view from Heaven really worth all of the judgement passed? 
The pestilence that you’ve inflicted, and the souls of all the loved one’s we’ve lost? 
We are the sheep that rose against the shepherd, we are the ones you led astray
Embrace the light in your heart, not the one in the sky
Saints and sinners rejoice, we will all rot together",Cursed
Counterparts,"Everything ends, at least that's what we hope for. Plagued by our past and we're doomed to repeat ourselves. Afraid of the thoughts that dance in revolutions, and circle the mind like a snare: Binding me, I'm just trying to feel something. Cold and stale, searching for warmth inside of every promise wasted. You wrap yourself around me, but I can only sense your presence. You're nothing but a carcass. I've never felt more alone than I did on those nights I spent watching you sleep. You're the furthest thing from me, and you've been there from the start. An empty shell, you're vacant and it scares me to death. One by one, I watched them leave me behind like living debris. Fortunately, I know that I'm not worth it. In my purest form, I was never good enough for anyone. Why did I think that this time it'd be different? I came bearing only the beat of my heart and the best of my intentions. I tried my hardest but I couldn't make you feel a fucking thing.",Debris
Counterparts,"The grave welcomes you with open arms. Last light escapes, last breath remains.      Circling the body, brushing passed the skin and bone. It cradles you, your holy manger. Born into ruin, we feel withdrawal. Death is your procreator, your             predecessor. From your decay grows a beautiful garden, The stalks caress your    failure, and the petals bring you closer to eternity. Pray for your rebirth. Pray for your chance to bloom. The heart starts and stops, the mind disconnects. As flowers, we grace the earth with our presence. The tide rises and turns, and we simply expire.  Over-saturated, our lungs fill with the essence of the universe. Until we feel the gentle kiss of dawn draw the water from our lungs, and we can breathe easy. Like night and day, we have never met. Aching for one another, we aim for     congregation. You are my prey, you are the martyr. The blight takes it's toll and our bodies grow black. Wilted, we fade away. Rotted from the root, we exchange our stem for legs. We blossom into our bodies, and the process has been reset. Welcome to your new home.",Decay

We spend out golden years as living ghosts
Caught in a constant state of purgatory
We are only burdened by our memories until the day they cease to exist
and we follow shortly after
Although I wonder if at any time
our minds fell upon the same plane
I know they did
I just wish I had a chance to go back and appreciate it
But we'll always have the winter

It was the only real companion that I have ever had
Not meant to live like this

Consciousness is nothing more than a vicious cycle
And I am being bled dry by my conviction
I've spent my life trying to find my confidence
And found absolutely nothing

Life is a lost cause
Too weak to carry on
I wish I'd never met who I once was
Not meant to live like this

Pursuing the love in all that I have lost
But I have left myself neglected
Deserted from the start
Longing for a chance to wander
A chance to chase my aspiration

Counterparts,"I live with the awareness of my own seclusion. Existence fuelled by separation, A war I will not win. Embracing only alienation. To suffer is to abandon the only home I've ever had. Outlier. I don't belong here. The present state of existence acts as a refuge for the weak. To shield our eyes is to blind mankind. Refusal to secede. Inhabiting a world of filth which others have condemned. We won't live our lives for them. Human hatred is my second nature. This is the root of my isolation. I am what I am, and I am an outcast. Don't look for me in the clouds, when I am beneath you. Nowhere to be found. Submerged in apathy, it's just becoming hard to care, and I am nothing. I have grown sick of the sound of my heartbeat. And while the whole world breathes in unison. My lungs are my shield, to reject the world around me. I am what I am, and I am an outcast.",Outlier
Counterparts,"If I allow the light to leave my eyes, I will never see again 
The thoughts disintegrate into cognitive pollution 
Abandoning my body, renouncing my existence 
Show me the meaning of happiness 
Trapped inside this nightmare, but I haven’t slept for days 
I am a slave, a slave to what I cannot see 
Are we being strung along or are we just strung out? 
The quest to be clairvoyant: You are your own black hole 
How much longer do I really have when I wish every breath would be my last? 
Your words like rope, tied around my throat Remove the earth beneath me 
Watch my spirit sink",Slave
Counterparts,"Tragedy is all we have in common, and at times we allow it to swallow us whole. Drawing the marrow from our misfortunes to ignite the fire that's inside, inhale the smoke from the burn that leaves you breathless. Breathing life into the        lifeless, dragging them into the sun and exposing them as apparitions. But is there dignity in living as an entity? ""You could have made history, and we are already forgetting about you."" Humanity is poison, and we are lost without a cure. So stop your heart and start the healing process. I am not fit to walk among you, but I don't want to end my life. And just know that If I knew of any common ground, I'd leave here now, and I would find a home that I could die in. Just to say I tried to rest in peace. Erase me from your memory. The ones we love will let us down, and the rats will feed off of our failure. Eventually, this is something that we must accept. The world moves on without us. We leave only footprints that fade away in time. Walk with fire, and save yourself from vagrancy. We leave our spirits to retrace our steps. You are your memorial, find your mark and make it. The soil is the last thing we ingest, we watch our ashes scatter. You are your own memorial, find your mark and make it .",Soil

Forever seeking anything to take responsibility
Life is what’s killing me (life is what’s killing me)
I hate the fact that I’m alive
Forever searching for my scapegoat because I refuse to face reality

At least I can say I tried

But tragedy will find us

I’m held captive by my spoiled soul
I won’t allow it to affect my stride
The procession will proceed as we’re gifted with our own idea of peace

So find yourself in me
I promise I will keep you as we harvest the passion that remains
Make my skin your sanctuary

I make a pact with the earth to draw life from the living
Make my skin your sanctuary
Leap to the beat of my blood
So place your hand in mine, drag your feet across the tops of trees
Breathe easy knowing that the branches will support you
And the weight of your complication

We communicate but only in tongues
Our lips will welcome the caress of the crucifixion
And we stain the wood with defeat

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

I need a raincoat
I need a big love

These train conversations are passing me by
And I don't have nothing to say
You get what you pay for
But I just had no intention of living this way

I need a phone call
I need a plane ride
I need a sunburn
I need a raincoat

And I get no answers
And I don't get no change
It's raining in Baltimore, baby
But everything else is the same

There's things I remember and things I forget
I miss you
I guess that I should
Three thousand five hundred miles away
But what would you change if you could?

I need a phone call
Maybe I should buy a new car
I can always hear a freight train
If I listen real hard
And I wish it was a small world
Because I'm lonely for the big towns
I'd like to hear a little guitar

Wrap her up in a package of lies send her off to a coconut island
I am not worried, I am not overly concerned
With the status of my emotions ""Oh"", She says, ""You're changing.""

But we're always changing
It does not bother me to say this isn't love
Because if you don't want to talk about it then it isn't love
And I guess I'm going to have to live with that
But, I'm sure there's something in a shade of grey or something in between
And I can always change my name if that's what you mean

My friend assures me ""It's all or nothing""
But I am not really worried, I am not overly concerned
You try to tell yourself the things you tell yourself to make yourself forget
I am not worried
""If it's love"", she said, ""then were gonna have to think about the
consequences""
She can't stop shaking and I can't stop touching her and.....

This time when kindness falls like rain
It washes her away and Anna begins to change her mind
""These seconds when I'm shaking leave me shuddering for days"" she says

I'm not gonna bend and I'm not gonna break
I'm not gonna worry about it anymore

Snap her up in a butter fly net and just pin her down on a photograph album
I am not worried, I've done this sort of thing before
But then I start to think about the consequences
Because I don't get no sleep in a quiet room and...

The time when kindness falls like rain
It washes me away and Anna begins to change my mind
And every time she sneezes I believe it's it's love and
Oh lord.... I'm not ready for this sort of thing

She's talking in her sleep
It's keeping me awake and Anna begins to toss and turn
And every word is nonsense but I understand and
Oh lord... I'm not ready for this sort of thing

Her kindness bangs a gong

Counting Crows,"Step out the front door like a ghost
Into the fog where no one notices
The contrast of white on white.

And in between the moon and you
The angels get a better view
Of the crumbling difference between wrong and right.

I walk in the air between the rain,
Through myself and back again.
Where? I don't know
Maria says she's dying.
Through the door, I hear her crying
Why? I don't know

'Round here we always stand up straight
'Round here something radiates

Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
And she walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus
She parks her car outside of my house, takes her clothes off,
Says she's close to understanding Jesus
She knows she's more that just a little misunderstood
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous

'Round here we're carving out our names
'Round here we all look the same
'Round here we talk just like lions
But we sacrifice like lambs
'Round here she's slipping through my hands

Sleeping children got to run like the wind
Out of the lightning dream
Mama's little baby better get herself in
Out of the lightning

She says, ""It's only in my head.""
She says, ""Shh, I know it's only in my head.""

But the girl on the car in the parking lot
Says: ""Man, you should try to take a shot
Can't you see my walls are crumbling.""

Then she looks up at the building
And says she's thinking of jumping.
She says she's tired of life;
She must be tired of something.

'Round here she's always on my mind
'Round here (hey man) I got lots of time
'Round here we're never sent to bed early
And nobody makes us wait
'Round here we stay up very very very very late

I can't see nothing, nothing
Around here
You catch me if I'm falling
You catch me if I'm falling
Will you catch me because I'm falling down on here
I said "" I'm under the gun""
'Round here.
Oh man I said ""I'm under the gun""
'Round here.
And I can't see nothin', nothin'.

And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think that I could be forgiven I wish you would

The smell of hospitals in winter
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls
All at once you look across a crowded room
To see the way that light attaches to a girl

And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think you might come to California I think you should

Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after two a.m.
And talked a little while about the year
I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower,
Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not show her

And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe
Maybe this year will be better than the last

I'm still looking for a girl
One way or another
I'm just hoping to find a way
To put my feet out in the world

Caught some grief from a falling leaf
As she tumbled down to the dirty ground
Said I should have put her back there if I could
But everyone needs a better day
And I'm trying to find me a better way
To get from the things I do to the things I should

All my friends and lovers leave me alone
To try to have a little fun
One way or another I just wish I had known
To go out walking in the sun
And find out if you were the one

Does it make you wanna come a little closer now?
And did you wanna dance with me?
Did you wanna hum a little harder now?
Can you see her waiting there?
Can you see her? Because I'm almost there
Can you see her waiting there for someone like me? 
All you want is a beauty queen
Not a superstar but everybody's dream machine
All you want is a place to lay your head
You go to sleep dreaming how you would
Be a different kind if you thought you could
But you come awake the way you are instead

When the weather bothers me
I empty drawers of other summers
Where my shadows used to be
And she is standing by the water
As her smile begins to curl
In this or any other summer
She is something altogether different
Never just an ordinary girl

And in the evenings on Long Island
When the colors start to fade
She wears a silly yellow hat
That someone gave her when she stayed
I didn't think that she returned it
We left New York in a whirl
Time expands and then contracts
When you are spinning in the grip of someone
Who is not an ordinary girl

And when you sleep you find your mother in the night
But she stays just out of sight
So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming
And when you wake the morning covers you with light
And it makes you feel alright
But it's just the same hard candy you're
remembering again

You send your lover off to China
And you wait for her to call
You put your girl up on a pedestal
Then you wait for her to fall
I put my summers back in a letter
And I hide it from the world
All the regrets you can't forget
Are somehow pressed upon a picture
In the face of such an ordinary girl

And when you sleep you find your mother in the night
But she fades just out of sight

Carved by an artist who's hand is demure
Got a mind like a saber
Razor sharp and sure

God how I hate myself for still wanting her

Tell me it's nicer dreaming, visions soft and sure
No way to find there's nothing left to me and her
Nothing more but a heart still at war

And fly away to someone new

They left the television screaming that the radio's on 
Someone stole my shoes 
But there's a couple of bananas 
And a bottle of booze 

Oh well, happy new year's baby! 
We could probably fix it if we clean it up all day 
Or we could simply pack our bags 
And catch a plane to Barcelona 'cause this city's a drag

I'll spend my life in jail.

Or the elephants will get out and forget to remember what you said

I thought he was a bitter man
He spoke of women's ways
He said they'll trap you and they'll use you and before you even know
For love is blind and you're far too kind
Boy, don't ever let it show

I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger

The can-can such a pretty show
It will steal your heart away
But backstage back on earth again
All them dressing rooms are grey
They come on strong and it ain't too long
For they make you feel a man
But love is blind and you soon will find, yeah
You're just a boy again

He said I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger

When you want her lips, you get her cheek
Makes you wonder where you are
And if you want some more then she's fast asleep
Leaves you twinkling with the stars

You'll have to learn it just like me

Four strong angels at her command to send
Four more seasons, for all that's broken to mend

I got four good reasons why I can't go back there again

She had skin like a statue, milky white and pure
Carved by an artist whose hand is demure
Got a mind like a sabre
Razor sharp and sure

God how I hate myself for still wanting her

Tell me it's nicer dreaming, visions soft and sure
No way to find there's nothing left to me and her
Nothing more but a heart still at war

'Cause I'm awake in my room
I've been up for 38 hours
And it don't look like sleep's coming soon

'Cause I could break like a bird
Or I could swallow the sea
It seems like the daylight is coming
And no one is watching but me

But I don't mind the dark
Discovering the day
'Cause the night is a beautiful bright blue and gray

What brings me down now is love
'Cause I can never get enough
And what brings me down now is love
'Cause I can never get enough of love

And it's a dangerous time
For a heart on a wire
Shuttle from station to station
Noisily not knowing why

So I put my head on the ground
And the sky is a wheel
Spinning these days into things that I've lost
But you can keep all the years

But I don't mind the days
Gone rolling away
'Cause all this sunlight feels warm on my face today

But what brings me down now is love
'Cause I can never get enough
And what brings me down now is love
'Cause I can never get enough, never get enough
Never get enough, no no, never get enough, no oh no
And still I can never get enough of love

And what brings me, brings me down now is love
'Cause I can never get enough of love
I can never get enough of love
I can never ever get enough
I can never get enough of love

Counting Crows,"Colored rubbers and a bedroom set
I wouldn't know it if it hit me
You take a little step and then it feels like love
I think I better get a little of it in me
Give me a kiss
I think it feels like love
Give me a kiss
I think it feels like sunshine
C'mon baby, light me up
I wanna look into your eyes until I go blind and...

[Chorus]
You think that you can do without me
I can't do anything at all
You think that you can do without me
But I don't believe in Sundays
And I don't believe in anything at all

Your mother make you in a parking lot
My mother made me out of flesh and wire
Try to remember what you might forget
I try to remember everything
Try to remember so you don't disappear
Try to remember so you don't fade away
Your mother made you out of smoke and rain
Your mother made you in a fire that's faded

[Chorus]

I wanna touch you for the things I'm losing
I wanna touch you for my self-respect
Give me a reason or I might stop breathing
Give me a reason why I'm soaking wet
Gotta stop breathing cause the sky is falling
I might go out and watch the moon explode
Give me directions to the highway crossing
I'll go lie down in the middle of the road

Counting Crows,"I sold my piano
It couldn't come with me
I locked up my bedroom
And I walked out into the air
When nothing I needed
Is left there behind me
I walk out through the shadows
Of Washington Square

Now I wander the highway from Dublin to Berkeley
And I heard the songbirds of Valley Paurine
I love like a fountain
And it left me like nothing
Just the memories of walking through Washington Square

Now I live in the shadows
Where light is electric
And time is just a number
That rests on a wall
Nobody knows me
My friends and my family
Are as far from this city
As Washington Square

So cover this warm night
In a blanket of starlight
I will follow this freeway
Out into the air
In case you should wonder
And wanted to find me
I'm traveling homeward to Washington Square
In case you should wonder
I'm in Washington Square
Washington Square

Counting Crows,"You know I don't like you
But you want to be my friend
There are bodies on the ceiling
And they are fluttering their wings
It's OK, I'm angry
But you'll never understand
You dream of Michelangelo
They hang above your hands

[Chorus]
And I know, she is not my friend
And I know, cause there she goes
Walking on my skin again

And I can't see why
You want to talk to me
When your vision of America
Is crystal and clean
I wanna white bread life
Just something ignorant in the rain
But from the walls of Michelangelo
I'm dangling again.

[Chorus]

Saturn on a line
The sun afire of strings and wires
Spin above my head and make it right
Anytime you'd like, you can catch a sight
Of angel eyes on emptiness and infinite
And I dream of Michelangelo when I'm lying in my bed
I see God upon the ceiling
I see angels overhead
And he seems so close
As he reaches out his hand
We are never quite as close
As we are led to understand

And I know, she is not my friend
And I know, cause there she goes walking walking walking
And I know, she is not my friend
And I know, cause there she goes
Walking on my skin again and again
On my mind
Oh Lord no
Yes she's walking on my skin again and again",When I Dream of Michelangelo
Counting Crows,"Anythings hard to change
But hey I got you down on your knees again
You watch the sky
It's a pale parade of passing clouds
That cover
The bed upon which we laid
In the dark
And the memories that I made
Of a laughing girl
But you're just my toy
And I can't stop playing with you, baby

[Chorus]
If you think you need to go
If you wanted to be free
There's one thing you need to know
And that's that you can't count on me

Coming along real good
But I still can't do most of the things I should
I watch the sky coming down to bury me and
I can't stop this crawling out of my skin
I know that you see yourself flying in
Out of the sky
Coming down
To carry me
But I won't come out

[Chorus]

No you can't count on me

I watched all of the same parades
As they passed on the days that you wish you'd stayed
All this pain gets me high
And I get off and you know why

Aw you can't count on me
No you can't count on me",You Can't Count on Me
Counting Crows,"Dancing like the nights are down in Nashville
But I seem to know the ghosts who like to run
I got a call to go to a late night picture show
So I traded in the darkness and I'm already glad, I'm already there
And I'm trying to make some friends

So if you see that movie star and me
If you see my picture in a magazine
Or if you fall asleep by the bedroom TV
Well honey, I'm just trying to make some sense outta me

I left a lot of ghosts in San Francisco
And now you wanna say you see through me
But what you wanna see ain't your memories of me
So why you turn around tonight but I'm already there, I'm already there
And I'm just trying to make some friends

So if you see that movie star and me
If you should see my picture in a magazine
Or if you fall asleep while you're watching TV
Well honey, I'm just trying to make some sense in Los Angeles

Boston gets cold this time of year
It seems like each day just leaves me numb
I gotta get out of here and go walking in the sun

Well, if you see that movie star and me
If you should see my picture in a magazine
Or if you fall asleep by the bedroom TV
But honey, I'm just trying to make some sense
Honey, I'm just trying to make some friends
Well baby, I'm not trying to make amends
For coming to Los Angeles, oh, Los Angeles

No more Boston, no more Nashville, no more Oakland
Oh baby, come on out to the sea
Come on, take a walk down Sunset with me

Spend my money on the wine,
I pay my bills and get my fill,
'Cause the last of the traveling kind,
Don't want no damn religion,
Because I'm not prepared to die,
But I've been wrong,
Sometimes baby you can hide.

Well I told my doctor, doctor,
I gave all my love away,
I'm a bathroom boy if you've been my toy,
Well then I think better anyway,
And I will lie right down,
Beneath the ground,
When my time has come to go,
But until then man,
I gotta think that maybe I don't know,
I said until then girl,
I gotta think, maybe you don't know.

I get my sessions on the phone,
I'm gonna take my pills and spend my nights alone,
When I find myself the real thing I go home.

What I take us for, it's a midnight ploy,
We're on the road alone,
I cant get high but I know why,
I've done the things that I shouldn't have done,
Oh got the bills, I took my pill,
And went down for the night,
Oh for just one time,
To be with you and I could die,
I guess I don't know how to be alive.

Counting Crows,"Sunday morning LA coming down in a KG71,
I wasn't coming to stay,
Going back to the real life soon enough,
Every things all good,
And Everyone is cool,
I'm only leaving down the coast,
Now all I want is something more,
L.A. time today,
I've been riding a wheel that's coming off,
I had the right of way all the time,
And I feel I'm getting lost,
Just coming around the block,
Hey you seem like a nice kid lets get off,
I just realized that is all fun,
Get off on life and the journey south.

Moving time today,
Someone doing the same things I have done,
We never get away,
These stupid sinners the angels all have guns,
And they're only here until its done,
We only here until we're gone,
Yeah, gone, gone, gone, gone.",Sunday Morning L.A. [*]
Counting Crows,"My friend assures me, ""It's all or nothing.""
I am not worried
I am not overly concerned
My friend implores me, ""For one time only,
Make an exception.""
I am not worried
Wrap her up in a package of lies
Send her off to a coconut island
I am not worried
I am not overly concerned with the status of my emotions
""Oh,"" she says, ""you're changing.""
But we're always changing

It does not bother me to say this isn't love
Because if you don't want to talk about it then it isn't love
And I guess I'm going to have to live with that
But I'm sure there's something in a shade of gray
Or something in between
And I can always change my name
If that's what you mean

My friend assures me, ""It's all or nothing.""
But I am not really worried
I am not overly concerned
You try to tell yourself the things you try to tell yourself
To make yourself forget
I am not worried
""If it's love,"" she said, ""then we're going to have to
think about the consequences.""
She can't stop shaking
I can't stop touching her and

This time when kindness falls like rain
It washes her away and Anna begins to change her mind
""These seconds when I'm shaking leave me shuddering
for days,"" she says
And I'm not ready for this sort of thing

But I'm not going to break
And I'm not going to worry about it anymore
I'm not going to bend and I'm not going to break
And I'm not going to worry about it anymore
No no no no no,
It seems like I should say, ""As long as this is love""
But it's not all that easy so maybe I should
Snap her up in a butterfly net
Pin her down on a photograph album
I am not worried
I've done this sort of thing before
But then I start to think about the consequences
Because I don't get no sleep in a quiet room and

The time when kindness falls like rain
It washes me away and Anna begins to change my mind
And every time she sneezes I believe it's love and
Oh Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing

She's talking in her sleep
It's keeping me awake and Anna begins to toss and turn
And every word is nonsense but I understand and
Oh Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing

Her kindness bangs a gong
It's moving me along and Anna begins to fade away
It's chasing me away
She disappears and
Oh Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing",Anna Begins
Counting Crows,"I was down at the New Amsterdam staring at this yellow-haired girl
Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation with this black-haired flamenco dancer
She dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
We all want something beautiful
I wish I was beautiful
So come dance this silence down through the morning 
Cut Maria! Show me some of them Spanish dances
Pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones
Believe in me
Help me believe in anything
I want to be someone who believes

Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales
Stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you. Ah, no, no, she's looking at me.""
Smiling in the bright lights
Coming through in stereo
When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely

I will paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray 
All of the beautiful colors are very very meaningful
Greg is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

Mr. Jones and me look into the future
Stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you.
Uh, I don't think so. She's looking at me.""
Standing in the spotlight
I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody loves me, I will never be lonely

I want to be a lion
Everybody wants to pass as cats
We all want to be big big stars, but we got different reasons for that Believe in me because I don't believe in anything
and I want to be someone to believe

Mr. Jones and me stumbling through the barrio
Yeah we star at the beautiful women
""She's perfect for you, Man, there's got to be somebody for me.""
I want to be Bob Dylan
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
When everybody loves you, son, that's just about as funky as you can be

Mr. Jones and me staring at the video
When I look at the television, I want to see me staring right back at me
We all want to be big stars, but we don't know why and we don't know how 
But when everybody loves me, I'm going to be just about as happy as can be

Takes her clothes off
Says she's close to understanding Jesus
She knows she's just a little misunderstood

Counting Crows,"Won't you scratch my itch sweet Annie Rich
And welcome me back to town
Come out on your porch or I'll step into your parlor
And I'll show you how it all went down
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town

Oh, and I remember something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
So I headed west to grow up with the country
Out across those prairies with the waves of grain
And I saw my devil,
And I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from
Cheyenne to Tennessee

We flew straight across that river bridge,
Last night at half past two
The switch man waved his lantern goodbye
And so long as we went rolling through
Billboards and truck stops pass by the grievous angel
And now I know just what I have to do

And the man on the radio won't leave me alone
He wants to take my money for something
That I've never been shown
And I saw my devil,
And I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from
Cheyenne to Tennessee

The news I could bring I met up with the king
On his head an amphetamine crown
He talked about unbuckling that old Bible belt
And lit out for some desert town
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town

Oh, but I remembered something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you",Return of the Grievous Angel

Explode against a black fist
He falls to the floor
He stares up at the sky and he may wish he knew why
But he can’t go back there no more

Future sounds so crazy
We’ve all heard that song before
Tomorrow’s the name we change from yesterday to blame
When the train just don’t stop here anymore

I got starry-eyed on the coaster ride
Andy says “Man, I need a break from the world outside
These days my life just careens through a pinball machine
I could do so much better but I can’t get off the TILT”

There’s a photograph on the TV
Black and white and 
Andy says something to you 
Jack Johnson straddling Reno, Nevada like 
She says “I forget myself sometimes too”

Out past the doorways where we are sleeping
The White Queens creep and the tomcats peep

And now I’m not breaking
The train’s just shaking
And I’ve never made it here before
There’s a Wild Mouse spinning the girls around
Til they can’t take it anymore
I used to dream in the dark of Palisades Park
Up over the cliffs and down among the sparks
It’s a long life full of long nights
But it’s not what I was waiting for
Everybody’s seen the horses diving down the shore
It’s a miracle they don’t make them anymore

So…”Make up ladies”…Wake up baby

You walked into the bar like some Saturday star
Stud-straight on spiked heels and needles and nerves
You’re a downtown pride fully-amplified Clyde
Gin-tight and aging but well-preserved

Remember Andy standing outside your bedroom window
Saying “Come on, let’s drive across to the Palisades
Keep going til we hit Reno, Nevada”
Don’t see Andy all that much these days

Still there are pages in back of the Action stacks
Where the White Queens creep and the tomcats peep

And the train’s not braking
The track’s just shaking
And I never made it here before
There’s a Sky Rocket turning the world around
Til I can’t take it anymore
You can carry that spark from Palisades Park
Down over the cliffs and out into the dark
It’s a long life full of long nights
And it’s not what I was looking for
Everybody dreams of horses flying ‘round the shore
It’s a bad dream we’re not having anymore

Man, have you seen Andy?
Hey man, have you seen her around?
Hey man, have you seen my my my Andy?
Hey man, have you seen her?
Have you seen him?
Have you seen her?
You seen Andy around?

Dressed up in our pirate best
All leathers and feathers and pearls
Andy said “Look at me man!
I am cookin’
These hands could finger up this whole world!”

He says “Come outside
Climb out your bedroom window
Shimmy down the fire escape
And say goodbye”

Come outside
Andy says “I’m dressed up just like Edie
Changing all the time
These leopard spots to polka dots
And say goodbye”

Come outside
Maybe we could move to California
Just meet me at the subway
And say goodbye

Come outside
The cops all think we’re crazy
But if you stay, you’ll just get married 
To a girl who’ll never know you
And then say goodbye

Hey Man, have you seen Andy?  
I lost her in the sun
I was high as a kite on Lovely & White
Man, you could lose anyone

Hey man, have you seen Andy
I don’t know where he’s gone
Real love outlives teenage lust
We could get wet and it keeps us warm

Love is like Angel Dust
Lovely sometimes changes us…sometimes not
Have you been aching to trust or just…?
Have you been waking yourself with lust…?
Have you been making us up or just taking us home?

It’s a long wait at a long light
Cars frozen in flight
All the traffic stops to stare

At a crosswalk in Reno, Nevada
Wearing nothing but air
And a pair of grey paper wings 
Andy thinks “I got nothing to wear”

We got nothing to wear…
We got nothing to wear…

Counting Crows,"Colorado passes by like writing on a wall
Headed Eastward down to New Orleans
Dipping into Texas as the stars are fading out
But there’s still a lot of country in-between
When I left California, I was 29 years old
And the world just spun me ‘round
Now I just watch Louisiana
Scroll across the windowpane
And I face in the direction I am bound
 
Cover up the sun
Let the river run
Make the waters come and wash me away
 
Me, Clifton and the King of Cats sat down in the road
Pedro said “Boys, we’re three of a kind”
He said “I’ve sat with river rats
And I’ve hung my hat with diplomats
I had 4 brothers once upon a time”
He said they toured the country far away from the Rio Grande
But the road just wore them down
So they bought a house beside a lake outside of New Orleans
And they stared in the direction of the escalating sound
 
Cover up the sun
Let the river run
Take this good man’s son and wash him away
 
Sister Indecipherable is talking to a wall
Back in New York City, she’s a queen
Resurrect or genuflect
She saves the ones she can’t protect
And keeps the chapel pris- (if not Sis-) tine
She drinks Absinthe mixed with kerosene
To keep herself upright
But the world still brings her down
If you can’t keep your shit together when God is on your side
What chance do you have when he’s not around?
 
Cover up the sun
Make that water run
Let the river come to wash me away
 
People of the Mardi Gras in their Tuesday best
Waiting for the South to rise again
Children of Geronimo grieving for The West
Feather-dressed and marching the refrain
In the dark of Armstrong Park
The marching bands attend
But they never make a sound
Just a quiet prayer for Congo Square
A silent conversation there
With the night to rest our eyes in
We just look to the horizon for a change
 
Cover up the sun
Let the river run
Pray the waters come to wash me away

But less than I need”

I guess you stayed because you wanted to stay    
And we went from zero to everything all in a day
And then Kennedy took you away
 
I thought of a short robe that was keeping you warm
And the moments that make up your life until you wake up
You sit on a swing in the dark with a girl
And she tells you she wanted to kiss you
And you know the worst part of a good day
Is hearing yourself say goodbye to one more possibility day
It goes on and on
 
I go west but your weather has changed
You’re just scared 
I mistake it for strange
When you want me to leave then you start to believe I should stay
But I gotta get out of LA
 
It seems like the short days are over
Cause you just don’t sleep in the daylight so I don’t sit up nights
I lie on my back on the top of a hill
And your body is breaking the sky because you’re shaking
And the worst part of a good day is knowing it’s slipping away
That’s one more possibility day that is gone

I said goodnight                        Goodbye
It seems like a good thing so you know it’s a good lie
You can run out of choices
And still hear a voice in your head when you’re lying in bed

And it says that the best part of a bad day is knowing it’s okay
The color of everything changes
The sky rearranges its’ shade and your smile doesn’t fade
Into a phone call and one bad decision we made

And the worst part of a good day is the one thing you don’t say
And you don’t know how but you wish there was some way
So you pull down the shades and you shut off the lights
Because somehow we mixed up “Goodbye” and “Goodnight”

You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

To stand and wonder, to wait
While the wheels of fate
Slowly grind my life away. 
Who am I?

There were some things that I loved one time.
But the dreams are gone I thought were mine.
And the hidden tears that once could fall
Now burn inside at the thought of all
The years of waste, the years of crime
Passions of a heart so blind;
To think that, but even still
As I stand exposed, my feelings are felt
And I cry into the echo of my loneliness.

Who am I
To stand and wonder, to wait
While the wheels of fate
Slowly grind my life away.
Who am I?

What a nothing I've made of life
The empty words, the coward's plight
To be pushed and passed from hand to hand
Never daring to speak, never daring to stand
And the emptiness of my family's eyes
Reminds me over and over of lies
And promises and deeds undone
And now again I want to run
But now there is nowhere to run to.

Who am I
To stand and wonder, to wait
While the wheels of fate 
Slowly grind my life away.
Who am I?

And now my friend we meet again
We shall see which one will bend
Under the strain of death's golden eyes
Which one of us shall win the prize
To live and which one will die
'Tis I, my friend, yes 'tis I
Shall kill to live again and again
To clutch the throat of sweet revenge
For life is here only for the taking.

A story I will tell
About Pretty Boy Floyd the outlaw,
Oklahoma knew him well.

It was in the town of Shawnee,
It was a Saturday afternoon,
His wife beside him in the wagon
As into town they rode.

There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude
Using vulgar words of language
And his wife she overheard.

Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain
And the deputy grabbed a gun
And in the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down.

Then he took to the trees and timbers
And he lived a life of shame,
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name.

Yes he took to the trees and timbers
On that Canadian River's shore
And Pretty Boy found a welcome
At many a farmer's door.

There's many a starving farmer
The same old story told
How the outlaw paid their mortgage
And saved their little home.

Mothers tell you 'bout a stranger
That came to beg a meal
And underneath his napkin
Left a thousand dollar bill.

Now as through the world I ramble
I see lots of funny men
Some will rob you with a six-gun
Some with a fountain pen.

But as through life you travel,
Yes, as through life you roam,
You'll never see an outlaw
Drive a family from their home.",Pretty Boy Floyd
Country Joe McDonald,"Back in nineteen twenty seven
I had a little farm, I called that Heaven.
The prices up and the rain come down
And I hauled my crops all into town,
I got the money
Bought clothes and groceries
Fed the kids and raised a big family.

But the rain quit and the wind got high
A black old dust storm filled the sky.
I traded my farm for a Ford machine
Poured it full of this gasoline
Started rocking and rolling
Deserts and mountains to California.

Way up yonder on a mountain road
Hot motor and a heavy load
Going pretty fast I wasn't even stopping
Bouncing up and down like popcorn popping
I had a breakdown ?
Kind of a nervous bustdown.
The mechanic fellow there charged me five bucks,
Said it was engine trouble.

Way up yonder on a mountain curve
Way up yonder in the piney wood
I gave that rolling Ford a shove
And I coast as far as I could
Commencing rolling
Picking up speed
Come a hairpin turn and
I didn't make it.

No man alive I'm telling you
That the fiddles and the guitars really flew.
That Ford took off like a flying squirrel
And it flew halfway around the world
Scattered the wives and children
All over the side of that mountain.

Got to California so dad gum broke
Dad gum hungry that I thought I'd choke.
I bummed up a spud or two
And a wife fixed up some 'tater stew.
We poured the kids full of it
Mighty skinny kids
Looked like a tribe of thermometers running around.

No man I swear to you
That was surely mighty thin stew
So damn thin I really mean
You could read a magazine right through it
Look at the pictures, too
Pretty whisky bottles and naked women.
Always have thought and always have figured
That if that damn stew had been just a little bit thinner
Some of these here politicians could have seen through it.",Talkin' Dust Bowl

From the Redwood Forest to the Gulfstream waters

'Twas there that he got his parole
After four long years on a man killing charge
Tom Joad came a-walking down the road, poor boy,
Tom Joad came a-walking down the road.

It was there that he found him a truck driving man,
It was there that he caught him a ride.
He said, ""I just got loose from McAlester pen
On a charge called homicide, great God,
A charge called homicide."" 

The truck rolled away in a big cloud of dust
And Tommy turned his face towards home.
He met Preacher Casey and they had a little drink
And he found out his family they was gone, Tom Joad,
He found out his family they was gone.

He found his mother's old-fashioned shoes
He found his daddy's hat
He found little Muley and little Muley said,
""They've been tractored out by the cats, Tom,
They've been tractored out by the cats."" 

Then Tom he walked to the neighboring farm,
He found his family.
They took Preacher Casey and they loaded in the car
And his mama said, ""We got to get away, Tom.""
His mama said, ""We got to get away"".

The twelve of the Joads made a mighty heavy load
And grandpa Joad, he cried.
He picked up a handful of land in his hand,
He said, ""I'm sticking with my farm until I die.""
He said, ""I'm sticking with my farm until I die."" 

They fed him spare ribs and coffee and soothing syrup
And grandpa Joad, he died.
We buried grandpa Joad on the Oklahoma road
And grandma on the California side
And grandma on the California side.

We stood on a mountain and we looked to the West,
It looked like the Promised Land.
Was a big green valley with a river running through
And there was work for every single hand, we thought,
Work for every single hand.

The Joads rolled in to the Jungle Camp,
It was there that they cooked them a stew
And the hungry little kids in the Jungle Camp
Said, ""We'd like to have some, too,
Yes, we'd like to have some, too."" 

A deputy sheriff fired loose at a man,
He shot a woman in the back,
But before he could take his aim again
It was Preacher Casey dropped him in his tracks,
Good boy, Preacher Casey dropped him in his tracks.

Well, they handcuffed Casey and they took him to jail
And then he got away.
He met Tom Joad by the old river bridge
And these few words he did say, Preacher Casey,
These few words he did say: 

""Well, I preached for the Lord a mighty long time,
I preached about the rich and the poor,
But us workin' folks has got to stick together
Or we ain't got a chance anymore, God knows,
We ain't got a chance anymore."" 

Then the deputies come and Tom and Casey run
To the place where the water run down
And the vigilante bug hit Casey with a club
And he laid Preacher Casey on the ground
And he laid Preacher Casey on the ground.

Tom Joad he grabbed the deputy's club,
He banged it down on his head
When Tommy took flight in that dark and rainy night
Was a preacher and a deputy lying dead, two men,
A preacher and a deputy lying dead.

Tommy went back to where his mama was asleep,
He woke her up out of bed.
He kissed goodbye to the mother that he loved
And he said what Preacher Casey said, Tom Joad,
He said what Preacher Casey said.

Everybody might be just one big soul
It looks that-a way to me
So everywhere you look in the day or night
That's where I'm gonna be, Ma,
That's where I'm gonna be.

Wherever people ain't free,
Wherever men are fighting for their rights

giving all your love to just one man.
You'll have bad times
And he'll have good times, 
Doin' things that you don't understand.
 
But if you love him you'll forgive him,
even though he's hard to understand.
And if you love him Oh be proud of him,
'Cause after all he's just a man.  
 
Stand By Your Man,
Give him two arms to cling to,
And something warm to come to 
when nights are cold and lonely.
 
Stand By Your Man,
And tell the world you love him.
Giving all the love you can.
Stand By Your Man.
 
Stand By Your Man,
And show the world you love him.
Keep giving all the love you can;

Country Teasers,"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.

Courtenay Day,"I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you

Courtney,"What do you do when you don't get better
Strong arms get too, get too weak to hold her
Oh god, give me just enough strength to make it through

Sleepless, this madness is walking me out to the ledge
And stands there beside me, shivering out on the edge
And oh God all I, all I ask is a little relief, just a moment of peace

I don't want to live without you
I'm not ready to live without you
So let's dance a little, laugh a little, hope a little more

Courtney Barnett,"I sleep in late
Another day
Oh what a wonder
Oh what a waste.
It’s a Monday
It’s so mundane
What exciting things
Will happen today?
The yard is full of hard rubbish it’s a mess and
I guess the neighbors must think we run a meth lab
We should amend that
I pull the sheets back
It’s 40 degrees
And i feel like I'm dying.
Life’s getting hard in here
So i do some gardening
Anything to take my mind away from where it’s supposed to be.
The nice lady next door talks of green beds
And all the nice things that she wants to plant in them
I wanna grow tomatoes on the front steps.
Sunflowers, bean sprouts, sweet corn and radishes.
I feel pro-active
I pull out weeds
All of a sudden
I’m having trouble breathing in.
I’m having trouble breathing in.
I’m having trouble breathing in.
I’m having trouble breathing in.

My hands are shaky
My knees are weak
I can’t seem to stand
On my own two feet
I’m breathing but I'm wheezing
Feel like I'm emphysemin’
My throat feels like a funnel
Filled with weet bix and kerosene and
Oh no, next thing i know
They call up triple o
I’d rather die than owe the hospital
Till I get old
I get adrenalin
Straight to the heart
I feel like Uma Thurman
Post-overdosing kick start
Reminds me of the time
When i was really sick and i
Had too much psuedoefedryn and i
Couldn’t sleep at night
Halfway down high street, Andy looks ambivalent
He’s probably wondering what i’m doing getting in an ambulance
The paramedic thinks I'm clever cos i play guitar
I think she’s clever cos she stops people dying
Anaphylactic and super hypocondriactic
Should’ve stayed in bed today
I much prefer the mundane.
I take a hit from
An asthma puffer
I do it wrong
I was never good at smoking bongs.
I’m not that good at breathing in.
I’m not that good at breathing in.
I’m not that good at breathing in.",Avant Gardener
Courtney Barnett,"I got drunk and fell asleep
Atop the sheets but luckily
I left the heater on

And in my dreams I wrote the best
Song that I’ve ever written
Can’t remember how it goes

I stayed drunk and fell awake
I was cycling on a plane
And far away I heard you say you liked me

We drifted to a party, cool
The people went to arty school
They made their paints by mixing acid wash and lemonade

[Chorus]
In my brain
I re-arrange
The letters on the page
To spell your name

I found an Ezra Pound
And made a bet that if I found
A cigarette, I’d drop it all and marry you

Just then a song comes on:
""You can’t always get what you want""
The Rolling Stones, oh woe is we, the irony

The stones became the moss
And once all inhibition's lost
The hipsters made a mission to the farm

We drove by tractor there
The yellow straw replaced our hair
We laced the dairy river with the cream of sweet vermouth

In my brain
I re-arrange
The letters on the page
To spell your name


You said, ""We only live once""
So we touched a little tongue
And instantly I wanted to

I lost my train of thought
And jumped aboard the Epping as
The doors were slowly closing on the world

I touched on and off
And rubbed my arm up against yours
And still the inspector inspected me

The lady in the roof
Was living proof that nothing
Really ever is exactly as it seems

In my brain
I re-arrange
The letters on the page
To spell your name


We caught the river boat downstream
And ended up beside a team
Of angry footballers

I fed the ducks some krill
Then we were sucked against our will
Into the welcome doors of the casino

We drank green margaritas
Danced with sweet senoritas
And we all went home as winners of a kind

You said ""I guarantee we'll have more fun
Drink till the moon becomes the sun
And in the taxi home I’ll sing you a Triffids song""

In my brain
I re-arrange
The letters on the page
To spell your name",History Eraser
Courtney Barnett,"I saw you in the lane next to me
You were doing freestyle, then you switched it around
To a little bit of backstroke
I couldn't see underneath
Your swimming cap, but it appeared that you had
Dark colored hair, maybe it was blonde for all I know
I had goggles on
They were getting foggy
I much prefer swimming to jogging

I tried my very best to impress you
Held my breath longer than I normally do
I was getting dizzy
My hair was wet and frizzy
Felt my muscles burn, I took a tumble turn
For the worse, it's a curse
My lack of athleticism, sunk like a stone
Like a first owner's home loan
When I came to, you and your towel were gone",Aqua Profunda!
Courtney Barnett,"I know that I let you down
You're not keen on what you found
When's the funeral?
Do you want me to come?

I'm not what you're looking for

You need a lock and key

I love all of your ideas
You love the idea of me

Courtney Barnett,"Jen insists that we buy organic vegetables
And I must admit that I was a little skeptical at first
A little pesticide can't hurt
Never having too much money, I get the cheap stuff at the supermarket
But they're all pumped up with the shit
A friend told me that they stick nicotine in the apples

If you can't see me, I can't see you
If you can't see me, I can't see you

Heading down the Highway Hume
Somewhere at the end of June
Taxidermied kangaroos are littered on the shoulders
A possum Jackson Pollock is painted in the tar
Sometimes I think a single sneeze could be the end of us
My hay-fever is turning up, just swerved into a passing truck
Big business overtaking
Without indicating
He passes on the right, been driving through the night
To bring us the best price

If you can't see me, I can't see you
If you can't see me, I can't see you

More people die on the road than they do in the ocean
Maybe we should mull over culling cars instead of sharks
Or just lock them up in parks where we can go and view them
There's a bypass over Holbrook now
Paid for with burgers no doubt
I've lost count of all the cows
There'll be no salad sandwiches
The law of averages says we'll stop in the next town
Where petrol price is down
What do I know anyhow?

Courtney Barnett,"Tell me when you're getting bored and I'll leave
I'm not the one who put the chain around your feet
I'm sorry for all of my insecurities, but they're just a part of me
Envy is thin because it bites but never eats
That's what a nice old Spanish lady once told me
Hey Debbie-Downer turn that frown upside down and just be happy

I don't ask too much of you
It's true and I can't read your mind

Don't stop listening, I'm not finished yet
I'm not fishing for your compliments

I'm growing older every time I blink my eyes
Boring, neurotic, everything that I despise
We had some lows, we had some mids, we had some highs
Sell me all your golden rules and I'll see
If that's the kind of person that I wanna be
If I'm not happy I'll be glad I kept receipts

I don't ask too much of you
I use to wonder what to wear

Courtney Barnett,"I lay awake at four, staring at the wall
Counting all the cracks backwards in my best French
Reminds me of a book I skim-read in a surgery
All about palmistry, I wonder what's in store for me
I pretend the plaster is the skin on my palms
And the cracks are representative of what is going on
I lose a breath, my love-line seems intertwined with death

I'm thinking of you too

I lay awake at three, staring at the ceiling
It's a kind of off-white, maybe it's a cream
There's oily residue zipping from the kitchen
It's art-deco necromantic chic, all the dinner plates are kitsch with
Irish Wolf Hounds, French baguettes wrapped loose around their necks
I think I'm hungry, I'm thinking of you too

I'm thinking of you too
I'm thinking of you too
I'm thinking of you too
I'm thinking of you too

Wondering what you're doing, what you're listening to
Which quarter of the moon you're viewing from your bedroom
Watching all the movies, drinking all the smoothies
Swimming at the pool, I'm thinking of you too

I can see Jesus and he's frowning at me
I see a dead seal on the beach
The old man says he's already saved it three times this week
Guess it just wants to die
I would wanna die too
With people putting oil into my air
But to be fair, I've done my share
Guess everybody's got their different point of view

I was walking down Sunset Strip, Phillip Island, not Los Angeles
Got me some hot chips and a cold drink
Took a sandy seat on the shore
There's a paper on the ground, it makes my headache quite profound
As I read it out aloud
It said, The Great Barrier Reef it ain't so great anymore
It's been raped beyond belief, the dredgers treat it like a whore
I drank 'til I was sinking, sank 'til I was thinking
That I'm thankful for this view
I drank 'til I was sinking, sank 'til I was thinking
That I'm thankful for this view

We either think that we're invincible or that we are invisible
When realistically we're somewhere in between
We all think that we're nobody but everybody is somebody else's somebody

Who am I to deny myself a pawn for you to use?
At the end of the day it's a pain that I keep seeing your name

I don't know quite who I am, oh but man I am trying
I make mistakes until I get it right

Oh! The humanity I wanna disappear into obscurity

We drive to a house in Preston
We see police arresting

Hows that for first impressions
This place seems depressing
It’s a Californian bungalow in a cul-de-sac

Its got a lovely garden
A garage for two cars to park in
Or a lot of room for storage if you've just got one

And its going pretty cheap you say
Well it’s a deceased estate
Aren't the pressed metal ceilings great?

Then I see the handrail in the shower
A collection of those canisters for coffee tea and flour
And a photo of a young man in a van in Vietnam

Thick head of hair, worries he's going bold
Wakes up at quarter past nine
Fair evades his way down the 96 tram line
Breakfast on the run again, he's well aware
He's dropping soy linseed Vegemite crumbs everywhere

Feeling sick at the sight of his computer
He dodges his way through the Swanston commuters
Rips off his tie, hands it to a homeless man
Sleeping in the corner of a metro bus stand and he screams
I'm not going to work today
Going to count the minutes that the trains run late
Sit on the grass building pyramids out of Coke cans

Headphone wielding to the Nicholas building
He trips on a pothole that's not been filled in
He waits for an elevator, one to nine
A lady walks in and waits by his side
Her heels are high and her bag is snakeskin
Hair pulled so tight you can see her skeleton
Vickers perfume on her breath
A tortoise shell necklace between her breasts
She looks him up and down with a botox frown
He's well used to that look by now
The elevator dings and they awkwardly step in
Their fingers touch on the rooftop button

I'm diving deep for the diamond tide
Save my heart and feed my soul
I'm coming home tonight
Coming home tonight

Follow the trade winds over
Footprints along the beach
Leading to where I know
There's someone missing me
Under a thousand stars
And the liliquoi moon

[Chorus]

Give me the fastest plane
I'm ready to go today

Courtney Jaye,"Is there life
Without any fear
I need more
Than just what I want to hear
But I won't be afraid of the dark
If you
Love me
Always thinking of me
I know I must be blind

In my dreams
When all of the flowers die
A little girl but she doesn't need to cry
If my dream doesn't last through the night
Could you
Love me
Always thinking of me
I know I must be blind

Love me

You know I'm good
I'll never behave
In the storm
I ride every wave
And I won't even look to the shore
If you
Love me
Always thinking of me
I know I must be blind

Love me",Love Me
Courtney Jaye,"It overtakes me, it levitates me
And lifts me up so high, it makes me wonder
It pulls me under and gives me butterflies

Now I'm surrounded, now I'm awake
And I can be sure

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love with everyone

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love with everyone

Sorrow shook me, love overlooked me
For the longest time but the fog is lifted
And the clouds have drifted, my heart is open wide

I don't know your story, I don't know your name
But I know I'm sure

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love with everyone

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, everyone

I wish that I could tell you I would
Slow down and commit but the world is so big
And full of life you can't hold in and I have so much to give

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love with everyone

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love

Every strong and steady man
Open heart and open hands
One I think about each time
It makes me close my eyes and smile

Like a best friend or a savior
One who is on his best behavior
Firecracker, troublemaker
You know who you are

Every rider on the waves
Every rockstar I have saved
Every boy who loves his girl
Every person in the world

I'm in love

",Love Song for Everyone
Courtney Jaye,"On this lonely stretch of solitude
I'm thinking 'bout the things that I never do
All the promises that I made to you
Well, they're just words, they're only words

It took so long for me to recognize
All this confidence that I couldn't find
I used to dim my light, so you could shine
And that's what hurts, it really hurts

I wanna do everything right
But everything's going wrong
I wanna feel heaven on earth
But nothing ever lasts that long

Baby, I'm goin' mental
So much potential
I can't stand to watch it withering away

It's out of control now
It's getting old now
And I can't afford to waste another day

Well, dust keeps piling up on the window sill
Man, if you don't know by now, I guess you never will
But there's no benefit in standing still
Not for you, no, no, and not for me

But I wanna make everything work
Something's just gotta give
I gotta start putting me first
It's killing me the way it is

Baby, I'm goin' mental
So much potential
I can't stand to watch it withering away

It's out of control now
It's getting old now
And I can't afford to waste another day

I wanna do everything right
But everything's going wrong
I wanna feel heaven on earth
And nothing ever lasts that long

Baby, I'm goin' mental
So much potential
I can't stand to watch it withering away

It's out of control now
It's getting old now
And I can't afford to waste another day

Courtney Jaye,"I complicate whichever way I try to go
I get in the way

I talk about it but I'm not complaining

But it's not raining

[Chorus]
Darling I want you to see it's permanent
Changes are waking in me it's different
I will not self destruct
And I do not need to destroy us

In my head I've gone back and forth

My old ways were temporary
Like the twilight as it fades

I want the feeling
Its still the only time of day
I can believe in
I watch it spin around again
To start me dreaming

I wasn't lost
Wasn't found
Wasn't anywhere at all
Wasn't up
Wasn't down
Til you showed me

[Chorus]
In a somersault
You never know where you are
Its easy to get lost
Easy to think nobody's breaking your fall
Now the summer's gone
And until your return
In a somersault
Thinking of you
I'll turn

Its hard to keep you at bay
So I keep busy here
Just filling seconds of the day
Until you are near

I wasn't in
Wasn't out
Wasn't anything at all

Courtney Jaye,"There's still a little sand inside of my shoes
I leave it there to keep me close to you
There's a whole other world inside me now
Full of words you can't hear
But the power of how I really feel
Is pulling you near

Its a vibration
There's no separation
We're one and the same
I don't have to be afraid
If you feel it
You might as well reveal it
Cause this is the day
Tomorrow could all be taken away

I can see the sun without the sky
But I can't see myself without your eyes
I wish I had told you this back then
I thought I had time
Well there's no use in swimming in regrets
I'll leave them behind

[Chorus]

Suddenly waves cover me
Graced from above
So heavenly wrapped
Under the weight of your love
And you show me what you are made of

Cause the power of how I really feel
Is pulling you near

Its a vibration
There's no separation
We're one and the same
I don't have to be afraid
If you feel it
You might as well reveal it
Cause this is the day
And I'm gonna ride the wave

This vibration
Without hesitation
This is the day
This is the day
If you feel it
You might as well reveal it
Cause this is the day
Tomorrow could all be taken away

",This Is the Day
Courtney Jaye,"Three years or a lifetime
Three words that just might have come too soon
Three hours from somewhere
I might have ended up with you

Hold me like a river
Hold me like a string tied to a balloon
You get what you're given
At any moment a moment of truth

[Chorus]
All my life I'm traveling light
Been living in a sky
I'll float I'll fade I'll carry away
Til you pull me down and think of me sometimes

I'm sorry for leaving
I'm sorry for all I could not do
You knew it was coming
Maybe in some ways I did too

The keys by the bedside
And bags in the hall

I'm searching for something in the ether of this mess
Riding above these missing pieces, leaves me weightless

Courtney Jones,"What is this road?
What is this journey?
And where does time go so slowly?
And how can we help but be who we are?
And change can end too much?
Love may be the end of us, but why, why should we fear?
Because with all the wondering, I?m weightless here in my dreams.
What is this someday?
What is it really?
But a tomorrow or today?
And frozen in the footsteps untaken, we stand side by side
Love may be the end of us, but why should we fear?
Because with all the wondering, I?m weightless here in my dreams
Take me into morning gently
And hand me off into the day
Suddenly I?m running slowly
Suddenly it all goes dark
Love may be the end of us, but why, why should we fear?
Because with all the wondering, I?m weightless here in my dreams
Suddenly I?m running slowly
Suddenly it all goes dark
Suddenly I?m running slowly
Suddenly it all goes dark

Courtney Kenny,"Girls:
 Tell us, sailor,
 Tell us, please,
 For we're terribly keen to know
 What it's like to be fancy free
 Footloose on the rolling sea?
 China girl chop-chop,
 Gay Maltese,
 Hot Mommas from Mexico-
 
 Harry:
 If you'll forgive a crude remark
 And don't resent a rude remark
 I'll let you into a secret-
 
 Girls:
 Well?
 
 Harry:
 They're all alike in the dark!
 
 Girls:
 There must have been
 Some place you've seen
 Superior to the rest?
 
 Harry:
 As a matter of fact
 With political tact
 I like America best.
 
 Girls:
 
 There's a good time a-comin on de ole plantation
 For a jolly Jack Tar
 Has just confessed
 The he likes America best!
 
 Verse 1
 
 Harry:
 I don't care for China,
 Japan's far too small,
 I've rumbled the Rio Grande,
 I hate Asia Minor,
 I can't bear Bengal
 And I shudder to think
 Of the awful stink
 On the road to Samarkand.
 
 Harry:
 I like America,
 I have played around
 Every slappy-happy hunting ground
 But I find America-okay.
 I've been about a bit
 But I must admit
 That I didn't know the half of it
 Till I hit the U.S.A.
 No likely lass
 In Boston, Mass.
 From passion will recoil.
 In Dallas, Tex.
 They talk of sex
 But only think of oil.
 New Jersey dames
 Go up in flames
 If someone mentions-bed.
 In Chicago, Illinois
 Any girl who meets a boy
 Giggles and shoots him dead!
 But I like America
 Its Society
 Offers infinite variety
 And come what may
 I shall return some day
 To the good old U.S.A.
 
 Verse 2
 
 Harry:
 I've loathed every acre
 From Cannes to Canton,
 I also deplore Bombay,
 I've jeered at Jamaica
 And seen through Ceylon,
 And exploded the myth
 Of those Flying Fith
 On the Road to Mandalay.
 
 Girls:
 We'll never mith
 Those blasted fith
 On the road to Mandalay.
 
 Harry:
 But I like America,
 I have traveled far
 From Northumberland to Zanzibar
 And I find America-okay.
 I've roamed the Spanish Main
 Eaten sugar-cane
 But I never tasted cellophane
 Till I struck the U.S.A.
 All delegates
 From Southern States
 Are nervy and distraught.
 In New Orleans
 The wrought-iron screens
 Are dreadfully overwrought.
 Beneath each tree
 In Tennessee
 Erotic books are read.
 And when alligators thud
 Through the Mississippi mud
 Sex rears its ugly head.
 But-I like America,
 Every scrap of it,
 All the sentimental crap of it
 And come what may
 Give me a holiday
 In the good old U.S.A.",I Like America
Courtney Kenny,"In Tropical climes there are certain times of day
When all the citizens retire to take their clothes off and perspire
It's one of those rules the greatest fools obey
Because the Sun is far too sultry and one must avoid its ultra-violet rays

The natives grieve when the White Men leave their huts
Because they're obviously....definitely....Nuts!

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun
The Japanese don't care to, the Chinese wouldn't dare to
Hindus and Argentines sleep firmly from twelve till one
But Englishmen detest-a siesta

In the Philippines they have lovely screens to protect you from the glare
In the Malay States there are hats like plates which the Britishers won't wear
At twelve noon the natives swoon and no further work is done
But mad dogs and Englismen go out in the midday sun

It's such a surprise for the Eastern eyes to see
That though the English are effete, they're quite impervious to heat
When the White Man rides, every native hides in glee
Because the simple creatures hope he will impale his solar topi on a 
tree

It seems such a shame when the English claim the Earth
That they give rise to such hilarity and mirth
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ho=ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho
He-he-he-he-he-he-he
Hm-hm-hm-hm-hm

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun
The toughest Burmese bandit can never understand it
In Rangoon the heat of noon is just what the natives shun
They put their Scotch or Rye down and lie down

In a jungle town where the Sun beats down to the rage of man and beast
The English garb of the English Sahib merely gets a bit more creased
In Bangkok at twelve o'clock they foam at the mouth and run
But mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun
The smallest Malay rabbit deplores this foolish habit
In Hong Kong they strike a gong and fire off a noonday gun
To reprimand each inmate, who's in late

In the mangrove swamps where the python romps there is peace from 
twelve till two
Even caribous lie around and snooze for there's nothing else to do
In Bengal to move at all is seldom if ever done
But mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday
Out in the midday
Out in the midday
Out in the midday
Out in the midday
Out in the midday
Out in the midday sun",Mad Dogs and Englishmen

I'm the proudest one 
Beneath the Dixie sun. 

News is spreadin' 
'Bout our weddin'; 
I hear church bells ringin', 
Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Cousins,"I can't keep from crying sometimes
I can't keep from crying sometimes
Oh momma she's dead and gone
And I know I'm all alone
I can't keep from crying sometimes

Early in the morning
About the break of day
I fall down on my knees
I fall down and I pray
I think about my woman
My woman who's long gone

I can't keep from crying sometimes
I can't keep from crying sometimes
Oh momma she's dead and gone
And I know I'm all alone
I can't keep from crying sometimes

Later in the evening
I watch the sun go down
I think about my woman
But my woman Lord she ain't around
My heart is filled with sadness
And my eyes are filled with tears

I can't keep from crying sometimes
Oh momma she's dead and gone
And I know I'm all alone

You seemed to go with the light of dawn

So very strange
I'm haunted by these things
They drive me crazy

They were so sweet
Soft on my face
As to feel you in my arms

As shadows shift from gray to red I notice there's no floor
Transparent air suspends my weight as if I had no mass
Then suddenly the moon comes out from the clouded skies
Wet and cold from shifting daydreams wakeful in the sleep
Windowpane observing some commotion down below
Waiting for the noise to come to blur the weary mind
Watching as a pastime and I'm the fallen star

In and out from foreign shores I've gone astray in time
Born to search for something I have never ever seen
On an endless quest to hostile ground and unknown lands
Then the scene go back to where it started and I fall
As shadows shift from red to gray I notice there's no floor
And gravity awakes me as it throws me to the ground
A million tiny grains of dust obscures me from your eyes

Every winter dies in sunlight only to be born again
And the rainfall feeds the forests while the lightning strikes the trees

Where they embrace the silent waves
Slowly they're swallowed by the water
And their breath ascending to the sky
I see them now floating in the water
Carried away, carried away

I see wasteland turn into gardens watching oceans giving birth
To fragile little creatures born to grow and multiply
And the children of the children of the firstborn claims the land
Building fences for protection from their brothers' greedy grasp

I watch kingdoms rise and crumble and the nations come and go
Only new names for the same things once the limit has been reached
Now I see them lose their interest in the deeds that have been done
And the wisdom that's been found as they return to whence they came

Beehive built in stainless, a cathedral for the slaves
Spineless cowards guided by ideals they couldn't grasp
Giving up their freedom in the hope of being chosen

I noticed they're all unique with faces that are all their own.

As I look and dream myself away, a sound is loud enough to hear,
Like disembodied, friendly voices carried on by southbound winds.
I wake up to the sound of silence, it's wasn't faint and far away,
Like the finest spray of water, they still speak of things I know. 

I turn to fix my eyes on the horizon, and I face the freezing gale. 
I observe the majestic wide waves as they rise and break and fall.

I noticed they're all unique with faces that are all their own.
Born to kiss a turbulent sky before they collapse and die.
I noticed they're all unique with faces that are all their own.
Born to kiss a turbulent sky before they collapse and die.

While they rise into the wild wind that picks them up before they strike,
Steals away their urgent faces, lifts the spirits to the skies.
And the language, soft and broken, but still, I understand it well.
We talk about the ones we care for and of all the things we lost.

Held in my heart for a day like today

Soft and distant calling like a fading memory

As that of the rain-soaked purple
Of the white birch in spring?

Have you ever felt more fresh or wonderful
Than on a warm fall night 
Under a Mackerel sky,
The smell of grapes on the wind?

Well I have known all these things
And the joys that they can bring
And I'll share them all for a cup of coffee
And to wear your ring

A quiet winter's snow slowly gathering
Like simple moments adding up?

Have you ever satisfied a gut feeling
To follow a dry dirt road that's beckoning you
To the heart of a shimmering summer's day?

Well I have known all these things
And the joys that they can bring
And I'll share them all for a cup of coffee
And to wear your ring

And I don't know how I survived those days
Before I held your hand
Well I never thought that I would be the one
To admit that the moon and the sun
Shine so much more brighter when
Seen through two pairs of eyes than
When seen through just one

Have you ever seen a sight as beautiful
As a face in a crowd of people
That lights up just for you?

Have you ever felt more fresh or wonderful
As when you wake 
By the side of that boy or girl 
Who has pledged their love to you?

Where nothing but darkness unfolds
And watch as all around you
She reveals the brilliance of secrets untold

Grow through the summer
Now I'm sitting, smelling summer burn through the fall
Winter's coming on, days getting dreary
And I'm thinking this is the season
That I leave you all

I've heard a man in crisis
Falls back on what he knows best,
A murderer to murder
A thief to theft
And I don't want you to think
That this is some kind of deathbed confession
But run is what I did when put to the test

Pile through the summer

Down the hall

The burdens of the father

Dishes piled high
She's on the front porch step
And the air smells like snow
She's thinking of the siege to come
And how she'll miss those weekends
In the park with the sun on her face
And her book by her side and that
Lingering taste that he left on her tongue

He lifts his glass from the table
It leaves a ring where it stood
He sees the light from the window
Caress her like he knows he should
He's remembering the first time he kissed her
And how he'd wake
And immediately he'd miss her,
Like a spell, with each breath,
He'd taste her breath like a haunting,
Irritating as hell

Do you remember when you'd pray
To never see the day
When someone would make you feel this way
'Cause you knew
They would cut right through you
And once inside, you were afraid they'd find
Nothing to hold on to

She brushes back his hair
He takes a sip from his glass,

Like what he sometimes finds inside her,
Hits so hard it can steal your breath forever
He sometimes wonders
Is the sum of their lives together
Him on the floor and her lost to a mind in tatters

These days he's drinking for the pleasure of falling
And he's falling for the pleasure of pretending
That she's sitting by the window waiting
For him to come calling

If I could fix me up a week of twilight hours
We'd sit on the point
And watch the sun continually flounder
Bathed in gold we'd plug into some kind of power
And connect with those days
Back before all of this went sour

'Cause I'm drinking for the pleasure of falling
And I'm falling for the pleasure of pretending
That you're sitting by the window waiting
For me to come calling

And with the last of the sun
You can feel the approach of the winter

Before they closed the lid?
I swear I saw him wink once and flash me that old grin

At the Red Tail gracefully soaring

What secrets does he hold that can be so grin?

Trying so desperately to get his attention

she says, ""honey, you're a bastard of great proportion"".
He says, ""darling, I plead guilty to that sin.""
With potatoes half way to his mouth
He looks her in the eye and says,
""without a doubt

What does she gain by all this sulking?
What trouble can there be for one so young?
Dark tension building like the clouds of a storm
Her daughter's in her room and she's at the door
Trying to figure what all this fuss is for.

she says, ""mother, you're a witch
And I'll always hate you.""

You speak are true.""

Look her in the eye gently says,

It's just that I ain't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is
But if you gotta go, it's all right
But if you gotta go, go now, or else, you got to stay all night

I certainly don't want you thinking that I ain't got any respect
But if you gotta go, it's all right
But if you gotta go, go now, or else' you got to stay all night

It ain't that I am wanting anything that you never gave before
It's just that I'll be sleeping and it will be too dark for you to find the door

Cowboy Junkies,"Door slams, car starts, he's on the road
She's left there sitting, angry and alone
Thinking what she should have said
Well, maybe she should have gone to bed
Now his words are swirling around in her head

He said and she said
And they both yelled together
Neither one hearing or listening to the other
Words like 'you never..' and 'you don't understand'
One word, then another
And then the whole thing's out of hand

But love's still there
It's just hiding in the dark 'cause it's scared
Hang on to those feelings that you know are true
And remember that this person means everything to you

Siren screams, breaks through her dreams
She rolls to the right
She realizes that he's still lost to the night
She gets out of bed both worried and mad
She prays that he's safe, her hanger holds back the drape

But love's still there
It's just hiding in the dark 'cause it's scared
Hang on to those feelings that you know are true
And remember that this person means everything to you

Door opens and in walks her baby
With a look on her face, says 'I'm sorry'
Now's not the time or the place to play games
So you hold out your hand and he does the same

And love's still there
It's just hiding in the dark 'cause it's scared
Hang on to those feelings that you know are true
And remember that this person means everything to you

The fruit of his heart he gave willingly
For her song.
From fresh wounds
Were gathered thick sheaves of love.
He lay open palmed to her world

She stretched in arched abeyance,
Holding thunderclap and starlight in one mind.
Sad to see the season go.
I'll miss the crackling of the air,
The loss of all I know.
Sad to see the season go.

Indian corn and the bitter taste of envy in the air.
Mired now in cyclic decay.
The nag of conquest.
Skeletal arms
Embrace a withering world.
Sad to see the season go.

I'll miss the crackling of the air,
The loss of all I know.
Sad to see the season go.
Locked here these dreams of you,
Imperfect dormant seeds.
There is a dignity
To this solitude,
A sparkling ambiguity
Both liquid and solid at one time.",Sad to See the Season Go

 Neither have I wings to fly
 Give me a boat that can carry two
 and both shall row, my love and I

 The sweetest flower when first it's new
 But love grows old and waxes cold
 and fades away like morning dew

'cause I know I'll see him again

I would feel as hollow as a bone

He could not help but hang his eyes

I want to yell farewell from a crowded pier
just me and a thousand good-byes
The tears will be bittersweet,
'cause soon she'll be back my side

You won't lose me, he replied,
together our lives have been sewn

Could be so carelessly misplaced.

Bread and wine, bread and wine your cross aint nearly as heavy as mine.

And the love you hang your life upon will start to slowly crack.

Forgetting to turn that one last time while she watches through the door.
Focusing on the garbage that she use to ignore.

Just forgetting how fucking lucky you are to have found her in such a crowd.

But we've seen a cloud of starlings rising on a crisp autumn day.
We were handed the weight of a child sleeping and bore her away.
We've tasted the tears that fall when saying goodbye forever.
And we've seen the silver from a waxing moon wash upon the shore.

I have heard about the lives of small swift birds.
They dazzle with their colour and their deftness through the air.
Just a simple glimpse will keep you simply standing there.
Legendary journeys made on fragile hollow wings.

Hits me straight in the eye
Guess you forgot to close the blind last night
Oh, that's right, I forgot, it was me

I sure do miss the smell of black coffee in the morning,
The sound of water splashing all over the bathroom,
The kiss that you would give me even though I was sleeping,
But I kind of like the feel of this extra few feet in my bed
Telephone's ringing, but I don't answer it
'cause everybody knows that good news always sleeps till noon

Guess it's tea and toast for breakfast again
Maybe I'll add a little T.V. too
No milk! God, how I hate that
Guess I'll go to the corner, get breakfast from Jenny
She's got a black eye this morning, `Jen how'd ya get it?'
She says, `Last night, Bobby got a little bit out of hand'

Lunchtime. I start to dial your number
Then I remember so I reach for something to smoke
And anyways I'd rather listen to Coltrane
Than go through all that shit again

There's something about an afternoon spent doing nothing
Just listening to records and watching the sun falling
Thinking of things that don't have to add up to something
And this spell won't be broken
By the sound of keys scraping in the lock

Maybe tonight it's a movie
With plenty of room for elbows and knees
A bag of popcorn all to myself,
Black and white with a strong female lead
And if I don't like it, no debate, I'll leave

Here comes that feeling that I'd forgotten
How strange these streets feel
When you're alone on them
Each pair of eyes just filled with suggestion
So I lower my head, make a beeline for home
Seething inside

Funny, I'd never noticed
The sound the streetcars make as they pass my window
Which reminds me that I forgot to close the blind again
Yeah, sure I'll admit there are times when I miss you
Especially like now when I need someone to hold me

Gather 'round now people, I'm here to tell a tale
About a man who walks among you, a man you each know well.

A job in the towers cooking the books for the shills that grease the skids.
Irony oh irony, you are a bitter fruit to eat.

Stripped of all your beauty your flesh is none too sweet.
Now I ain't the most honest man that ever worked a skim.
I was caught with my hand in the cookie jar and brother that was it.
Fifty-four and a big black mark upon my resume,
I found selling off what you don't own might earn you the time of day.

Next it was a letter from my darling one,
""what's yours is mine, what's mine is mine"",
Sealed with a hug and kiss.
One by one my children closed their lives to me.

Lesson learned on Daddy's knee,
""give no quarter to the weak"".
Irony oh irony, you are the polar seed of truth,
You grow upon the open plain the faithful you uproot.

Kicked around 'bout a year living hand to mouth,
Then one day tryin' to bum a light I felt my will give out.
Sat right down on the corner, started prayin' a little too loud.
Left my troubles far behind
When I saw them emptying their pockets out.

Irony oh irony, you are a treacherous son of a bitch,
Pretending not to care about the heights you'll never reach.
Now I won't start in preaching 'bout reaping what you sow,
This is the story of a half-hearted man,
Half honest as they go.

What to do with our fading star

Listen to them assail the night
Lost again in their caves of wonder

Here you will always be behind me
And you will not go away

There he sleeps on untamed land
Dark corners yet discovered
His heart yet to be
Trod upon, trod upon

Simply knowing what's to come

Knowing what's to come, what's to come

As you rub your eyes so violently 
While falling out of bed
Is there nothing educational 
In words that you are chewing
As you seek the soothing solace 
Of a friendly shower head


But I really must admit that 
I am glad that I am living

Would pray to God 
And ask that I was not

Try to run away, but I keep runnin'
Try to run away, but I keep runnin' into you

It's even in the furniture
That I bought for my brand new place
I live in an apartment now
But there's room enough for two

Try to run away, but I keep runnin'
Try to run away, but I keep runnin' into you

Every time I see you now it feels like I'm pretending
We could be together somehow lovers more than friends

Now when I see you
Take you out for a date
You've hardly said a word
When you say baby it's gettin' real late
You've gotta go to work too soon
So where are you takin' me now?

His accusations linger
He dispersed the blame for
He loved to play the game where

Easy to moan

Couldn't wait to beat me

If I sound above it
Cause I ain't sure where I'd be sittin

Cause this ain't how I should be livin

You never heard me scream.

And read a book alone by candle light,
Do you wonder what I just might be getting into.

Till you done free yourself there ain't a brand new start,

He moved back home and called and started hangin' around,
But every time I tried to talk to him, he put me down,
So I gotta let go.

Nobody knows who you are
Nobody cares who you are
Nobody knows why you feel
Disconnected.

Maybe it's the way I'm told I oughta look and feel,
Maybe it's because my mind is so easy to steal.
Then I'm living in a world where nothing here is really real,
So I gotta let go.

How do I get the fuck out of this place?
How when I look in a mirror do I not see my face?
Can I turn in my membership card to the human race?
Cause I gotta let go.

Nobody knows who you are
Nobody cares who you are
Nobody knows why you feel
Disconnected.

Well
I feel like I'm slowly goin' out of my head
When I'm battling the moments when I wish I was dead.
When my mind and body feel like fire and stone
And I know I'm gunna spend all my life alone.
And I swear I need to cover up my heart and soul,
I only gain perspective when I lose control.
Is it better to be cryin' when you feel insane,
Or laughin' out loud dancin' naked in the rain?

Have you ever felt the thunder inside your heart?
Holding onto all the shit that's going to tear you apart?

Nobody knows why you feel

Cowboy Mouth,"I wake up 
Start the coffee
Though you won't be up for hours
Fetch the morning paper
Lay them both out like they're hearts and flowers
And when you finish what I made you
Read the articles I saved you
I tell you that I couldn't sleep
Wondering if you still love me

So we can speed up
Slow down
Slow down 
Slow down
Slow down

On my tiptoes 'round the house
I tried my best to not disturb you
Quiet as a drunken mouse
Amuse myself until I've heard you
Then listen as ya brush your teeth
Wash your face turn on the TV
Till I think the moment's right
To try and talk about last night

Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
So we can speed up
Slow down
Slow down

I just need my pics of you
It fills the holes inside of me
'Cause whiskey, pot and pills dont make me
Feel so high, feel so free

It's what you do to me

Try to make it through the day
Chasin' all the same old ghosts
Has my fear become a drag 'cause
That's the thing I fear the most
You run your fingers
Through my hair
A thousand things that show you care
But sadness is my worst addiction
My head is filled with fact less fiction

Cowboy Roy Brown,"'t was on the Isle of Capri that I found her 
Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger 
't was goodbye at the villa Capri

She's sittin' at the bar, sippin?on a beverage
Try to use your platinum card to get leverage
It don't matter, she's got her own
She's got diamonds for buttons on her cellular phone
She's a cutie with a booty, a hottie with a body
Get her on the dance floor, gonna get naughty
Don't mean no harm, just a little fun
'Til it's time for breakfast and you see the sun

[ATOM]
Can't find the key to the door where her heart is
Can't find no magic word to say all the things I want to say
There's no equation for that rose, she only knows when she goes!

[Chorus - ATOM]
She's automatic, she's automatic
She turns on when she wants to
Don't give her no static, she's automatic
She turns on when she wants to

The beat gets fast and you're cravin' more
Suddenly you make you way to the floor
It's a hick-hop beat boy your body is pumped
All the fine ladies just shakin' their butts
Step up to one then you ask her to dance
It appears to you she's in a trance
Take your time son play your position
'Cause that's the primary mission

Can't find no magic word to say all the things I want to say

Step aside, 'cause it's time for some action
I'm a hick rhyme sayer with a kung fu grip
I get the job done instead of talkin' 'bout it

Early in the mornin', I'm up and I'm out
Hopin' one day my album goes platinum
Rockin' that mic so viciously
Deliciously, not maliciously

When atmospheric pressure and vapor pressure converge
There's a party surge, so I must emerge
Get the people hyped and keep going nonstop
Knock the party off the meter when the bass line drops

I'm a beast on the mic, can't get no satisfaction

Don't turn back, no retreatin'

You can see my vision, you can feel my force
Time to hit the trail, boy, the mic is my horse
I tantalize and tickle your tympanic with my English
Smile as you listen to the ruckus

See, I'm lyrically hypnotic, at times even psychotic
Neurotic, bionic and it may leave you catatonic

Everything is crowded, the music is bumpin'

Try to walk around but we're in demand
About then sweety went to the ladies room
And that's when the DJ played the boom

And you're dancin' to a groovin' tune
Just mellow out, shake your, mmm

You gotta blonde, a redhead, a brunette
In the gym working up a sweat
One on the treadmill, one on the bike
One in kickboxing class all night
Doing their best to work it out
Tryin' to get a nice body and a nice ""Badow""
You love to hear words comin' out of their mouths
These girls are G.R.I.T.S., 'Girls Raised In The South'

Gonna get cleaned up, meet at the spot
Each one is confident she's pretty hot
Hate to see them go but you love to watch them leave
Go on ladies just do your thang

Do your thang, baby do your thang

And we're doing it and we're doing it fast
The lights are bright, cocktails strong
Just do your thang, baby do your thang

Man look at that face, silhouette body
Kickin' so hard you thought she knew karate
Send a 'Thank you' to her dad and mom
'Cause once she smiles boy you know what's on
You know she has nice etiquette
But she'll laugh even though she doesn't get it yet
You want to hear her say no one can do it better
Next she's callin' out the 15th letter

Better recognize, get woke to some act rights
She'll get to the point like stalagmites
Bouncin' in the club in the black light
Girl so fine bow down like a jack-knife
She ain't frontin', she ain't stuntin'
Swingin' for the fence boy, she ain't buntin'
She's educated but she's fluent in street slang

A married Couple with kids and a family Pet. He takes for granted that it's all good and things are set. But she feels no passion in the romance. It's been a year since they had their last slow dance. Even worse, her husband treats her like an ornament. Every other week the kids have a tournament. A team meeting, or somewhere that they gotta be. But her hearts screamin ""HEY, WHAT ABOUT ME?"" Unbeknownst another hounds in the chicken coup. And he's makin moves like a player to the hoop. She met at the gym, or was it at the grocery? It doesn't matter, 'cause you know where it's goin be	! 'Cause last year, her mister got caught cheatin. So she figure that this is gonna make them even. He thought she'd wait, like all the times before. Until he found the note she left for him hangin at the door. It read: (REPEAT CHORUS) She's 16, Callin home to her momma. After to talk 'cause she's scared of all the noise and drama. She's been gone for a week and a half. All she wants is somethin to eat and a nap. 'Cause she's a runaway. Sleepin under bridges and sleepin in alley ways. Afraid to go to the shelter, so at night she prays that hopefully she's gonna see some better days. Meanwhile, Mom and Dad are really frantic. When they saw her clothes were gone you know they really panicked. Thoughts in their minds ""Did she run to the border?"" or even worse, ""Will she be a case of Law and Order?"". The Silence in her room screams of not feelin wanted, of not bein good enough it even seems haunted. All her pain soon will be known. When she leaves her mom and dad a message after the tone.

Cozmo,"There's a lady who's sure 
All that glitters is gold 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
When she gets there she knows 
If the stores are all closed 
With a word she can get what she came for. 
Ooh  ooh  and she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
There's a sign on the wall 
But she wants to be sure 
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. 
In a tree by the brook 
There's a songbird who sings, 
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it makes me wonder. 
There's a feeling I get 
When I look to the west, 
And my spirit is crying for leaving. 
In my thoughts I have seen 
Rings of smoke through the trees, 
And the voices of those who standing looking. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it really makes me wonder. 
And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
And a new day will dawn 
For those who stand long 
And the forests will echo with laughter. 
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, 
Don't be alarmed now, 
It's just a spring clean for the May queen. 
Yes, there are two paths you can go by 
But in the long run 
There's still time to change the road you're on. 
And it makes me wonder. 
Your head is humming and it won't go 
In case you don't know, 
The piper's calling you to join him, 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, 
And did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How ev'rything still turns to gold. 
And if you listen very hard 
The tune will come to you at last.

To be a rock and not to roll.

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade

Yo' tell the judge I be happy to pay him off if he's with it
My flesh and blood, hauled off to the cell
I search for heaven as I see him getting lost in this hell
Headed for coffin or jail, to never try is the ultimate fail
But love is wanting more for someone than they want for themselves
Deep, I guess I love a lot
Because the more I do my thang the more I feel the guilt and shame that my brother's not
Reminisce as we was kids screaming f*** a cop
Guess he took it serious, for me that s*** was just for props
Arms too skinny to hug the block
I found comfort in my dreams, of things seen on the screen of fortune and fame
Decisions, decisions, the Porsche or the Range
I take a trip back to the 'Ville only corpses remain
Some of them n****s still breathing but they dead inside
Victims of a genocide
Tears fill my eyes dawg

'Cause I've been out of touch man for way too long
I've been out in Hollywood for way too long
I've been, getting this paper for way too long
I ain't called my pops back in way too long
I done make my girl wait for way too long
I wonder if I changed, am I way too on?
Can't knock my hustle but It's way too strong
It's way too strong

He was shot, layin in the street dead, reasons unknown
Another homey gone, never have his own throne
cause an ignorant brother pulled the trigger
He wasn't even a brother, he was a nigga

who distribute the powder white while they killin' the color black

They choose to live in red, devil makin' decisions for em
cause they never knew the meaning of piety

Wherever you are
The hills or the valleys
Come near or come far
They say youth is a treasure

You're forever returning

The moon's on your shoulder

You're forever beginning
Barely winning the fight

Cr7z,"Letzte Nacht träumte ich von Krieg
So realistisch, so intensiv
Die Soldaten, die vermummten Gruppen, das Ducken vor Kugeln und die Ungewissheit in jeder Sekunde, die verfliegt
Alles außer Kontrolle in Anarchie, brennende Regierungsgebäude und Feuer in Familienhäuser
Fliehende Leute, heulende Mütter, die nach ihren Kindern rufen, sie suchen, oder sie hinter sich herzieh'n
Ein getrenntes Pärchen, dass sich in Ruinen wiedersieht, weinend in den Armen liegt und direkt wieder liebt
Männer, die rennen in Flammen und keinen Gedanken daran verschwenden, ob es einer von ihnen überlebt
Als ich erwachte, war ich schweißgebadet, habe geweint, wie damals, als ich klein und schwach war
Öffnete das Fenster, atmete die Luft, sah zum Himmel über Deutschland und erwartete den Schuss
Aber heute blieb alles beim Alten, freute mich zum einen
Doch zum ander'n hatte ich Sorgen, die sich vielleicht im Morgen entfalten
Diese friedliche Idylle akzeptiere ich nur widerwillig, weil irgendwo da draußen etwas waltet
Eine kühle Brise, die meine Gesichtszüge streift, aus dem Norden, wo es kalt ist
Sind wir so weit, die Kanäle zu öffnen, jedes beseelte Geschöpf der Erde zu schützen in einem Lichtschein?

Geh'n zurück an den Anfang und sind trotzdem am Ende
Gefallene Engel fielen uns in die Hände
Von Kindern die Weisheit und von Alten die Milde
Mein Wissen gespendet, letzte Meinung ist noch nicht gebildet

Heilige Mutter Maria Gottes im Himmel
Wie weit ist es, bis sich all unsere Hoffnungen erfüllen?
Wie fern schweben die goldenen Aufnahmen ins All?
In einem Raum, der sich spreizt, wie das Pfauenfederkleid
Wie oft werd' ich noch geweckt von lautem Geschrei?
Wie lang' glauben wir noch ihre Schauspielerei?
Wie viele müssen sich noch von Brücken werfen?
In welcher Zeit sind wir mit den Feinden im Reinen und können glücklich sterben?
Lass die Mütter die Kinder gebären, die immer währenden Frieden und Liebe in sich beherbergen
Und nicht verzehrt werden in den Fängen der Maschinen, den Klängen der Sirenen oder den Kämpfen mit dem Biest
Sieben ist heavenly movement
Pure Essenz aus einer Engelsenergie
Mannheim ist im Viereck angelegt
Hier unten fuhr ich Dekaden durch den Dreck, wie ein Jeep in Richtung Xer und bin nun endlich am Ziel
Die nächste Reise führt uns alle weiter
Zu lange wagte ich den Alleingang, aber lernte, nur gemeinsam verändert man viele
Unterbewusst hab' ich als Junge gewusst, dass ein Wunder geschieht, als ich mit 13 meine ersten Blätter beschrieb
Jetzt oder nie, der Zetter durchbrettert den Beat mit der Exzellenz eines weltbekannten Sängers
Denn die Gerechtigkeit siegt, solange wir uns vereinen, ich schweige im Leiden, wir beide schreiben heilige Musik

Geh'n zurück an den Anfang und sind trotzdem am Ende
Gefallene Engel fielen uns in die Hände
Von Kindern die Weisheit und von Alten die Milde

Wir können uns plötzlich wieder an alles erinnern
Diese Lieder gibt es, weil wir die Liebe empfinden
Dennoch werden wir klassifiziert als Spinner des neuen Milleniums
Die sieben Weltmeere, wenn die Wellen kommen, werden sie merken, wie ihre Lügengebilde vor unser'n Gefühlen erzittern
Wir spüren, dass etwas nicht stimmt und wir prüfen nicht mehr ihr Bitten im subliminal
Willentlich infiltrieren wir die Bilderberger Gefilde und ringen bis zur Spitze durch
Ich zieh' die Stärke aus dem Mittelpunkt der Erde und vermehre mein Wissen in jedem Wesen, das hört
Entweder, ihr jagt mir 'ne Kugel im Kopf, oder lüftet euren Betrug an uns
Sonst wird uns're Hydra sich erwehren
Wir werden alle nur geführt von den Sternen
Wir gehen dahin zurück, wo's anfing - Kryo oder Therme?
Prüfen meines Zyklus in der Düsternis der Berge, Mythos oder wer weiß
Der Kreis wird nicht brüderlich geteilt
Werf' den Schein in Wasser, es zieht konzentrische Kreise
Meine Schwester werd' ich niemals vergessen
Ihr geht zurseite, wenn ich flehe und teile für Jennifer in meiner Seele, die eins mit mir ist
Und das auch noch länger als ich hier lebe
Und mit Xavier gemeinsam steh' ich ein für das Menschengeschlecht
Langsam ist für diesen inneren Krieg ein Ende in Sicht

Get yourself a new tattoo
For those sleeveless days of June

I'm sitting on the cafe Zinho steps
With a book I haven't started yet
Watching all the girls walk by

Could I take you out?
I'd be yours without a doubt
On that Big Dipper

And if the sound of this it frightens you
We could play it real cool
And act somewhat indifferent.

And, hey, June, why'd you have to come
Why'd you have to come around so soon?
I wasn't ready for all this nature
The terrible green, green grass
And violent blooms of flowered dresses
And afternoons that make me sleepy

But we could wait a while
Before we push that dull turnstile
Into the passage

But thousands they have tread
And others sometimes fled
Before the turn came

We could wait our lives
Before a chance arrives
Before the passage

Or think about San Jose
Though I know it's not that pleasant

By the stinking canal and the cotton mill
Under a ghetto palm with her bicycle shorts on
With a gesture she said to me

I really must confess
I'd like to get undressed with you
And though the thought had never really crossed my mind
Oh, but that was a lie, so we went along

We went out under the turning leaves
The fetid earth was damp and cool
Autumn's feeble light on her salty neck
All innocence, it was lost

I hungered for past overtures
The curse of unrest and her ardent caress
Came much more than my soul could endure

Stirring from midnight's inertia
Knowing not even her name
On a thin precipice over carnal abyss

Drunk on red wine, her dead lips on mine
Suffused with the perfume of night

To mourning the loss of god in blackest velvet
Enrobed in their downfall like a swift silhouette

Counted carrion crows

She awoke from a fable to mourning
Church bells wringing Her madly from sleep
Tolled by a priest, self castrated and hung
Like a crimson bat 'neath the belfry

Three moondials froze in the shadow of six
As another soul passed to the grasping Styx
Clutching their trinket crucifix
Bats blew from caves in a dissonant surge
Omens of corruption from within the church
A fetid, dank oasis still clung to fool rebirth

Alone as a stone cold altar
The castle and its keep
Like faerytale dominion rose
A widow to the snow peaks
Wherein reclined the Countess
Limbs purring from the kill
Bathed in virgin white and like the night
Alive and young and unfulfilled

Was it the cry of a wolf
That broke the silver thread of enchanted thoughts?
Of Her life as a mere reflection
(As the moon's in narrow windows caught)
That opened like dark eyelids on
The sigh of the woods that the wind fell upon

Like a Siren weaving song
From the lilt of choirs choking
Where the vengeful dead
Belong...

To the Sorceress and Her charnel arts
She swept from ebon towers at the hour of Mars
'Neath a star-inwoven sky latticed by scars
To unbind knotted reins that kept in canter, despair
Shod on melancholy, fleet to sanctuary there,
In netherglades tethered where onyx idols stared

Was it the Kiss of the mist
That peopled the air with the prowess of absinthe?
Lost souls begging resurrection
From Gods upon their forest plinths
Whose epitaphs read of re-ascending to win
Remission from despair through a holocaust of sin

In a tongue hilted in invective rectums
Over signs and seals the sorceress prayed
To Death, to rend the slender veil
That Ancient Ones might rise again

As shadows swelled
The Countess fell
To masturbating with Her dagger
As the Witch gabbled spells
Cumming heavy roses all the way to Hell
As sudden thunder's grue harangue
Announced two pincered worlds

Exuding bane, something came
With the stench of necrophiled graves
To these clandestines
Who shrank from glimpsing horror
That the growls of mating houls inclined...

Resplendent
In pendants
(Natal trophies torn from bellies of desanctified nuns)
A demons, bewinged, bedight
In scum, prowled their circle seeking entry to run
An arctic tongue upon Her vulva
Where rubies smeared to alabaster thighs
Glittered like a contract in the purse of a whore
Receiving sole communion from the body of christ

""If blood is what thou carves, foul fiend
I will yield this witch to thee
If thou wouldst draw a veil for Me
O'er lengthening scars of age and grief""

As the Demon slavered foetid vows
And bore His prey away
In talons itching to perpetrate
The nausea of eternal rape
The Sorceress screaming in His grasp
Spat a final curse to stain
The Countess with the promise
That Her lord at war would be cruelly slain

And She would rot.
Alone
Insane.

And though the end is near, I´m not sorry
Catch my soul, it´s willing to fly away...

Mark my words, believe my soul lives on
Don´t worry, now that I have gone
I´ve gone beyond to see the truth...

So when you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you´ll begin to understand
Life down there is just a strange illusion...

Cradle of Filth,"Behind the scene of destiny
I adore you in this song for me
Call me within your holy house to dwell
Let me raise for myself in spell
Voluptuously dancing daughters of the night sky
Sing the rapturous love song with high
Let your sweet scented juice run
Waste away under the lashes of my whip

Bath in sin, sadistic souls
Break their crust, sodomy and lust

Carnal desire runs through my veins
Whipping boys and scapegoats cry in pain
Psychopathic terror during their sleep
My power ask why, my power is weak
Spineless bundles of my excess
Expurse of innocence and helplessness
In the perfumes of my secret orison
Fresh blood of children drops down on me

Bath in sin, sadistic souls
Break their crust, sodomy and lust

Madness, crime, disgrace, ptomaine
Excrements, contempt, violence, kill

Ordeals of thousand deeds congealed in gloom
Strike hard and deep, to hell with 'em master
Mighty prophets stature shall surpass the stars
The passion is the smell of cremation
I spit on your crapulous creed, curse 'em
Sucking you giveth delight and bright glory
Strive ever to be more joyous to the death
Don't fear any God will deny you for this

Prowls the clouds, dead,eyed
Like shifting parent flesh
Under silk matricide...
 
Watchful as she was upon Eden
Where every rose arbour and orchard she swept
hid the hissing of a serpent Libido
In an ancient tryst with catastrophe
Soon to be kept
 
Hear that hissing now on the breeze
As through the plundered groves of the carnal garden
A fres horror blows
But ten billion souls
Are blind to see the rotting wood for the trees

On our knees or another fuckerÂ´s shore
Heiling new flesh
Read, then roared
To a crooked cross and a Holy Cause
What else be whipped to frenzy for?

That the Seraphim shall sing
 
Old adversaries
Next of Eve

A swansong for ravens trapped flapping in night

A tragic yet magickal fall from grace
Too awful to taste for the led and the chaste
Those whose long fetters are addressed to all saints

Free shining souls torn from Giod's given Reich
Defiled, reviled, exiled from sight

And Hell knows we sought victory
Chancing the leash
But when bad die were cast
We were cast down to die
A steeple of needles thrust into our eyes
So scholars might say we were blinded by pride
Like the sin of Our Father (and the whims of our kind)
Whom in Isaiah and Midian thrived
Regaining His sights for the storming of skies

And after descenturies have crawled, vilified
Our dark harkened day on spread wing now arrives

For eternity is a coprophagic
Backward figure head
Gorging on Her own bitter end
And We have eaten shit
Until we're close to addicts

For us to make amends

To exalt our throne above the stars of God

Screams congeal in clotted pearl
As He unfurls from aching hibernation

Stormbringer drums thunder to full Dis orchestra
As lighting streaks with fire
Black clouds that shroud the Earth
Whose cold breasts have held us in scar pillories
But now the Sun is loath to come
The crescent moon is freed

Elated Satan
The scimitar slash to the undergash
Of Heaven too slight for penetration

We strike as wolves from the thickening fog
To exalt our throne ove the stars of God
Lowly holy goats bare the brunt
Of rabid dogmas on a stellar bearhunt
Bastioned in citadels and monastic cells
That smell of blessed cunt
Like a convent where crosses rust
From thirty dirty habits of shaved nun
There where deeper needs are begged of lust
And cess and less impress enough

Obtaining the ord of Our Gaurdian, Anger
And Death's tunnel vision
Bad thing in collision
The locking of eyes and jagged antler

Unpicking the seams of fate sewn over dreams
Feasting from throats of celestial thieves

And God knows we seek victory
Now that we are unleashed
To drive nails home of blind faith through those
Who drove us from error to terror below
Refugees clung to a crown furred in flies
Tarred with red honey, the plaster
Of many a spire that aspired to rise
Seeking Messiahs that by us soon die

In the start like a cast
In morality plays
Our hearts wore a mask
Of dead rooks in the rain
The World was our cloister
No prayer, bent in shame
Our once lucent plumage
Stung with horn withered grey
And away
As Aeons slew so we grew to myth
Revenge accrued to a monolith
Bursting through from our roofed abyss
Like an aether greased fist

Our horror pours through the orifice
Where once the spheres and archangels kissed
Phallelujah!

Fellated Satan
His coming assails

That engulf their nation

Now divintity is a worm ridden mouth
In a darkened high house
Overrun by disease

On reinstatement have won

Cradle of Filth,"""Oh, sweet Midian
I burn for thee at heart
Don't despair me
Come bare me on wings of graveyard robbed leather
To where pleasure rings deep secrets
In spurts after dark""

Under full moons waxing lyrically
Death's poetry floods the soul
Like the freezing seed of a demon freed
To curse the stars with vertigo
And in their dance, in trance I've prised wide
Slick rifts twixt obsidian thighs
Hymeneal gates to darker sides
A glimpse of plinths where Midian lies

Midian

Haunted by this portent
This obsession in my mind
With a city sunk below
Tall cedar groves and graves sublime
Sporting their importance
Marble wings spread to the skies
A vale of dreams that it would seem
The daylights race to leave behind

These visions struck like a furious fuck
Nailing wet lips to cold cemetery walls
Flashes of lust to dust
Splashed across my psychic pall
As hybrid lovers reached their cusp
With final thrusts I saw it all

Forbidden Midian
A long fabled Judecca
A sanctuary for sin
To rival Heaven
Free of Eden's tragic wreck
(Though the only Angels in repose
Were those with ivy strangled necks)
Small mercies in vistas of dolmen and vault
Gaunt, haunched edifices
Midst lightfingered mists
From whence more awful shadows
Drew back rusted bolts
And dared a threshold
The searing Sun had knelt to kiss

Shades of dusk, cruelty and myth
The Tribes of Christ will not forgive
And shall not suffer their kind to live

For I, mesmerized, started not from tombs
Or their waltz so sibilant
Through the gathering gloom
But from flumes of the moon in bloom
Baring cach a face effaced
And raped in the womb

In hidden Midian
A vatican lying in state
For the sanctity of sin
To rival Heaven
Above Eden's birth defects
Though the only Angels that arose
Were those who fell to most requests
Small mercies in vistas where dolmen and vault
Caught twisted whispers where fisted sisters
Haunched, flaunted orifice
Midst lighter fingered mists
Whilst I watched without revolt
Carnalities few beasts permit

Between the dog and wolf
Bared fangs met in intercourse
A nightly right of teeth and cunt
For those below who rose to hunt

Sor sights that preyed on Me for days
And in laudenum's haze
I painted them all

The slew of sith and kin
I drew in blood, my veins in thrall
To Deathugees at peace within
(An underworld free of Mortal rule)
Crotesques and wolves in women's skins
The raven winged and missing limbed
Suicides and split thighed Seraphim

And marble stairs
Star grazers dare
Ascend like prayer
(As smoke or ghost or lithe nightmares)

Under full moons waxing lyrically
Death's poetry floods the soul
Like the wrecking weed of a demon freed
To curse the star with vertigo
And in their dance, in trance I praise wide
Slick rifts twixt obsidian thighs
Hymeneal gates to other sides
A labyrinth wherein Midian hides

Midian

I know I've seen
Through the black backed mirrors in sanity
Lucent prides amassed in last retreat
Prurient souls but no more freaks
Than those leashing dreams at harm's length from Me
And just like grim ascension prophecies
My revenge, carved deep, will be
A grisly plot that reads
Like my filthy white ward spattered with their screams
When My Deviliverers come from fog for Me

Exhuming the moon
Through the bars in My room
The sooner the bitter pills swallowed are through
But no Aphrodites, Genotypes, Demonarchetypes,
No Cenobites rise to clame me from you

Gladly sacrificed

With Me

On words and dreams too cursed for day

Where the Faun Dawn bathed Her golden hair

Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
'Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the gallows pole
The sands of time for me are running low

When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me

Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream

Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
The words escape me when I try to speak

Tears flow but why am I crying
After all I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end? No

As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell, ""God be with you""
If there's a God then why has he let me go?

As I walk all my life drifts before me
Though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away

Mark my words, believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth

So when you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion

Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name

Cradle of Filth,"""Mirror, mirror on the wall
Shouldst not grave pleasures be my all?
For if I shall see thy Will be done
Grant Me the Witchcraft of thy tongue""

Three moondials froze in the shadow of six
As another soul passed to the grasping Styx
Clutching their trinket crucifix
Bats blew from eaves in a dissonant surge
Omens of corruption from within the church
A fetid, dank oasis still clung to fool rebirth

Alone as a stone cold altar
The castle and its keep
Like faerytale dominion rose
A widow to the snow peaks
Wherein reclined the Countess
Limbs purring from the kill
Bathed in virgin white and like the night
Alive and young and unfulfilled

Was it the cry of a wolf
That broke the silver thread of enchanted thoughts?
Of Her life as a mere reflection
(As the moon's in narrow windows caught)
That opened like dark eyelids on
The sigh of the woods that the wind fell upon

Like a Siren weaving song
From the lilt of choirs choking
Where the vengeful dead
Belong...

To the Sorceress and Her charnel arts
She swept from ebon towers at the hour of Mars
'Neath a star-inwoven sky latticed by scars
To unbind knotted reins that kept in canter, despair
Shod on melancholy, fleet to sanctuary there,
In netherglades tethered where onyx idols stared

Was it the Kiss of the mist
That peopled the air with the prowess of absinthe?
Lost souls begging resurrection
From Gods upon their forest plinths
Whose epitaphs read of re-ascending to win
Remission from despair through a holocaust of sin

In a tongue hilted in invective rectums
Over signs and seals the sorceress prayed
To Death, to rend the slender veil
That Ancient Ones might rise again

As shadows swelled
The Countess fell
To masturbating with Her dagger
As the Witch gabbled spells
Cumming heavy roses all the way to Hell
As sudden thunder's grue harangue
Announced two pincered worlds

Exuding bane, something came
With the stench of necrophiled graves
To these clandestines
Who shrank from glimpsing horror
That the growls of mating houls inclined...

Resplendent
In pendants
(Natal trophies torn from bellies of desanctified nuns)
A demons, bewinged, bedight
In scum, prowled their circle seeking entry to run
An arctic tongue upon Her vulva
Where rubies smeared to alabaster thighs
Glittered like a contract in the purse of a whore
Receiving sole communion from the body of christ

""If blood is what thou carves, foul fiend
I will yield this witch to thee
If thou wouldst draw a veil for Me
O'er lengthening scars of age and grief""

As the Demon slavered foetid vows
And bore His prey away
In talons itching to perpetrate
The nausea of eternal rape
The Sorceress screaming in His grasp
Spat a final curse to stain
The Countess with the promise
That Her lord at war would be cruelly slain

And She would rot.
Alone
Insane.
On the twisted nails of faith.



",Twisting Further Nails

Of dark and fragrant trees
Shirking from the rage
That tore the heavens free

A vagrant angel
His with span to see
The garden swell with terrors
To banish man and Eve

Another fall from grace
Whiplashed from the gates
Half naked and insane
Full blooded, breasted
Nerve ends tested
To behests of pain

A sombre lot to gain

As the storm slid in
Borne by carnal winds
The upper ether thinned
And therein sat abominations

Satan seated there
To savoring the reek of desolation
But their dank despair
Moved his speech to leech the air

""Behold the golden door
Paradise is lost
So praise me as you raised your Lord
And I shall thaw this gnawing frost""

Another fall from grace
Whiplashed from the gates
Half naked and insane
And destined for a spiteful fate

Wherein evil sought the shamed
As pawns in greater stakes
Across this cosmic game
To win the hand of darkness and
Set her in her rightful place

Cursed is the ground for thy sake
In sorrow thou shalt eat of it all the days of thy life
Thorns also and thistles shall bring it forth to thee
And thou shalt eat the herb of the field

In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread
Till thou return unto the ground
For out of it was thou taken
For dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou now return

With that the pact was sealed
And as creation reeled
Bewitched oration filled
The hearts of all
Who came to crawl
Upon these earthen fields

A sombre lot to till

A wracked black acid song
Spat from the massive throng
Of Seraph knelt along

Myself to a martyred wretch

I left a dirty white stain

Turning sermons with the smell
On Witchfinder fingers
Where bad memories lingered
Burning, as when Dante
Was freed to map Hell

To catch sight of the seams
And the vagaries inbetween...

And midst the lips and the curls
Of this cunt of a world
In glimpses I would see
A nymph with eyes for me

Eyes of fire that set all life aflame
Lights that surpassed art
In sight, that no intense device of pain
Could prise their secrets from my heart

I knew not her name
Though her kiss was the same
Without a whisper of shame
As either Virtue or Sin's
And pressed to Her curve
I felt my destiny swerve
From damnation reserved
To a permanent grin...

Into crystal glasses
We will touch the divine
Through kissed catharsis

Let us pitch to the seven year itch
Of the ultra-decadent
To a tainted world and the painted girls
That our fantasies spent

Tripping through boudoirs laced with opiate themes
Sipping the bizzare, tasting copious dreams
A toast to those most sacriligeous of days
Where for every whim won
One soon repays

We touched the stars
That now laugh from afar
At we, the damned

The damned

We have spent our time
Drenched in opulent splendour
But when midnight chimes
Will gilded souls surrender?

Let us drink on the giddying brink
Of pools of excrement

In a bright marble bridge stretched across dark waves
To the shore from the moon and by Her grace

And the gates to wolves break open then

Dogs of fogged derision

Pacing, soon to be

To make their drunken hearts
A coffin for their stories

Eyes flickered in deep thickets of trees
And mists clung tight in panic to vales

Lughnasadh to Samhain feasts
I heard her lament as season's blent
Together a chimerical beast

Cruel winter cut their sacred throats
With polished scythes that reap worldwide
Pitch black skies and forest smoke

Drones of carrion law
Drove the ghosts of my forbears
To rove and rally once more

One of her sons from the vast far-flung
Come home to rebuild
The rampant line of the Leonine
Risen over pestilent fields

Now the tidal are turning
Burning in darkness
The salvation of her hungry sword
Shalt spill like wine
From the hills to chines

Spreading her beheadings

Drones of carrion law
Drove the ghosts of my forbears

Though no malice she weans
Just a palace of dreams

Her rouge lips smack of dark blood
Her name in whisper rolls
Forever on my tongue
Lest her memory dissolve

Last serenades

Has fixed, a basilisk, a scythe
On charred remains
With shared disdain

Lipped with blood and last goodbyes

Now I dream
Enwrapt in pure clouds of the sweetest oblivion
Where beauty streams
Freed from the teeth of those beasts that had come
To tear out her spells
In red lettered cells
Wherein even the crown prince of Hell
Come out of his arrogant shell
Would falter to better

But her face soon dispels
And as black feathers fell
From heaven's smoke
So I woke to insanity
Her exquisite corpse
Found fit for their sport
Of course
Would burn on the morrow with meâ?¦

And there on this night
Strung up in my sight
Naked she sways
Displayed for their vulgar delight

I scream through my bars at the stars
That for these crimes of mine solace me
I will fear not the flames
That to passion are tame
Not nearly the same searing pain
(I pray) As held sway upon losing her
Nor the mettle of roars
That will settle like ashes and scores
As with our ghosts in the fog

Since the day I saw the cat at my door
So I came into you sweet lady
Answering your mystical call
Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future,the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
And I knew it was a spell she cast

With evil on her mind

Give me the ring on your finger
Let me see the lines on your hand
I can see me a tall dark stranger
Giving you what you hadn't planned
I drank the potion she offered me
I found myself on the floor
Then I looked into those big green eyes
And I wondered what I'd come there for

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind

Be careful of them neighborhood strays
Of a lady with long black hair
Tryin' to win you with nymphetamine ways

Showing the future,the past
Same cat with them evil eyes

Dear Lord I cry, before I die
Grant me the taste of love
One final time lest I should hide
When seraph call me from above

And should remorse not stay my course
From debt, addresses wept
Will ask no more of you my Lord
Save that my soul in hell is kept",Soft White Throat
Cradle of Filth,"As lonely as a poet on the walls of Jericho
Or the moon without the comfort of the stars
I am loathe to know it that a man without a soul
Is nothing but a spilled canopic jar

I proved it
Improved it
Drove a sonnet
Right through it
And in this state of bliss
Evil kissed with wet lips
Pen-filled Fingertips
Which through me
For through me
Illuminati usually pissed
But with words of some hurts worth
I threw a party that extended God's list

Exciting new flames that my fame would claim for me
Reciting back the almanac of travesties

They call me bad
Mad Caliban with manners
Dangerous to know
A passing fad
Taught in all debauch
In excess and in canto

Grown wild
This child
Whole harems defiled
Faustina's and Mina's 
Lady Libertine and her sisters between her

What spread of lies arise when lovers die
Which circle of hell is mine when I arrive

They call me bad
Mad Caliban with manners
Dangerous to know
A passing fad
Taught in all debauch
Crow against the virgin snow


Grown colder, my shoulder
Like a boulder beside her
And bolder, not wiser
My dark seed took up root inside her
That mouldered, where older

Beddings would hold a passionate sigh
But Laudanum and soda
Lord Numb coda
Merited a forest of inherited spite

Fleeing grief for foreign maps
I still played vampire aristocrat
Unloading my gun in hot, promiscuous laps

Then shooting swans in a gondola
I tripped my foot on a fallen star
And there's nothing like a mouthful of Venetian tar
To let you know just who you fucking are

The patron saint of heartache
I can't see my world is falling
The world is falling down
The patron saint of heartache 
I Can't see my world is falling
The world is falling down

Everafter can they hear my laughter

Whereupon I tell them
To go fuck their mothers

As so....

",Venus in Fear
Cradle of Filth,"We rise with the sun in the underworld
We suffer from a graveless name
We prise wide lids
And wounds with lips curled
Over teeth that have tasted shame

Cemetery and sundown

Against the flora of nightfall
We gather like the fauna of war 
To curse aurora so spiteful
With her stake in the coming of dawn
To conjure forth the past
Those heady night of pain resplendent 
In the service of the goddess of death
When her sheets ran royalty red

Moons lengthen our crypt kept silhouettes 
Shadows dance, eyes flicker in descent
Unveil the greed, our needs are bitter, spent
On upturned mouths and haunts of wickedness

We walk this eden, a secret
Faces hidden under leonine pride
In dusk's embrace
We find it hard to keep it
When blood and lust and waking worlds collide
Too long have we skulked like drifters 
In the cities of the neon sun
Vagabond dogs and graveyard shifters
Mona lisas where the paint has run 
I miss our glorious past
Our nightly flights on fear dependent
Like phantoms in the caves for miss christine
When the song bird broke her neck

Wolves howl their foghound serenades 
Churches arch their backs with balustrades
Praise be to the shedding of masquerades
When we hunt these vestal vermin unafraid
Of the covenant made. ....

Draw the blinds on the floors of raw meat 
There is murder in the thirst

Rich red vascular tapestries
Hung in gilded frames of nuns asleep
In dreams where themes of hestiality
Are a blessing on their sunday sheep

Sermons hang a black gown
Over cemetery and sundown

Now the clock is harrying midnight
And the ghost of yet to come
Will she show rewrites of dark delight
Over the sewers we've overrun? 
I see a winter palace
Cut diamonds at a porcelain neck
When swan lake crushed poor sanity's spirit
As I threw to it bled

We rise with the sun in the underworld
We suffer from a graveless name 
We prise wide lids
And wounds with lips curled 
Over teeth that have tasted shame

Cradle of Filth,"Carrion my name
For those who choose to mouth the curse
A tragic serenade
With Judas in my stride
The gothic halls of shame
Where statues coldly hold no worse
Than the murders I reclaim
From a dark, forsaken time

Kissing heaven,spent
He wipes lips free of his hectic discharge
Wishing to repent
For the brute that ravaged free
In slight hands beauty weeps
Conquest's deep methodical screwing
Hurt repeatedly
Like the world wound at his feet

Dirge Inferno

As it is written, damn it
So let it be wrung
From throats of those in overthrow
The past at last has come

A savage bite without respite
Pervades the freezing air
This winter chill, grist for his mill
If tears of joy will blear elsewhere
And church bells drown in the cracks of doom
The storms above us hew
As lightning runs like bifurcate tongues
Deflowering two by two

Hissing, malcontent
He storms the skies on electric discharge
Pissing in contempt
On the effigies of the weak
Killing all resolve
The great beast simmers, his scarlet women
Spit their vitriol
On the terrified face of peace

Dirge Inferno

As it is written, damn it
So let it be wrung
From throats of those in overthrow
Our past at last has come

A hellbound heart, the rose and thorn
Have locked to hasten blood
The moon disrobes, to harden droves
Of legions pouring
These rivers press, his breath adorns
Senates and enemy seats
Whilst his power takes as ingratitude
The writhing of the weak

Wormwood my name
The poisoned star that fell to earth
And blistered free of shame
In the pits of self-rebirth

Overseeing endless barracks
As the waters turn to claret

Like carpet bombs in vast bazaars
My blood runs with the beasts
Though no crescent, cross
Or wandering star
Shalt witness my defeat

Born of jackal in the Vatican 
To a loathesome flock
I have crept behind the drapes
And a wizard there is not
Just a white flag blackened by
Singing weapons that have led

Desert kingdoms of the dead

That spare the virgin heart
From the waking grasp of rapists in the dark

Mountaineers that strive so far
For a Heaven grown from reach
That love herself is fabled
To be missing from their peaks
Save in one sole tower
Where the presence of a rod 
Stays the sleeping beauty
From the prying fingers of the mob

Howitzer glare and spitfire blade
Wooed by Dresden serenades
Her soundtrack now a bombing raid
Bored of Vaudeville

God was six days sober
On the night that she was born
To the glistening star of a bible class
An icon now in religious porn
She was Alice through the gloryhole
An ejaculate misconception
Disney-esque, the high priestess
Of greed and deepest dark deception

All best-to-bury whims
For Miss Libertina Grimm

She, that little red riding crop
Brer Werewolf at her stocking tops
Beneath the tightened leather strop
Of the basque of the houndervilles

At the stroke of midnight come
She polished verse and hearses
In a poisonous pen dipped in omen
To her surgeon full of general curses
In the hand of morgue redeemers
Though the dead always pleased her more
Squatting in her coffins
Flirting curtsies to the thirteenth floor

Tip your hats

Snow white and the seven straws
Smoke and mirrors on all fours?

The final dance will be the cue

Nine candles lit to improve the gloom

Cradle of Filth,"One might see in Mina 
My disease 
But it is She who has infected me 
For all eternity... 

As the sun slips the tearaway stars 
Into the scented scheme of night 
I kissed her mouth like a dark red rose 
Set upon a marbled dream of white 
So pure of thought like a Vestal statue 
Jewelled with a God-lent grace 
I was close to coming when She bid adieu 
Fuelled by the heartache rent upon her face there 

Oh Mina, obscener 
Thoughts obsess my days 
Oh Mina, obscener 
Thoughts possess me 
That I must now obey 

They say the darkest hour 
Is that before the dawn 
When nothing in one's power 
Can dissipate the great forlorn 
Shadows of fire that haunt me 
Like risen whispers of her name 
For dawn is a dusk 
Wherein needs must 
Erupt from the grave, aflame 

Written in the dead of night 
And riding on the burning wind 
Smitten by her read delight 
My words alight like leaves of sin 

Stepping through a mirror 
The princess of the emerald glass 
Brought me one step nearer 
Love's infernal past... 

They say Hell hath no furies 
Like a woman scorned by life 
When the Heavenly Judge and juries 
Participate to chain this wife 
With forced virtues, Her secret needs 
Drew on my foreign blood 
On warm wet nights, with storm-wracked bites 
I gave her Eden after the flood 

Written in the dead of night 
And riding on the burning wind 
Smitten by her red delight 
My words alight like leaves of sin 

Verona, Marishka, Aleera 
Brides of old and goddesses all 
Forgive my wishes to be always near her 
Forever or whenever seas recall 

This Aphrodite from my embrace 
For as Mars (whom her lips placate) 
I tore these shores with wars of hatred 
Before our Paris set his fate 
In Helen, one might find mistake 
In winning tragedy 
For all eternity... 

I am still lovesick for Mina 
I am still so lovesick for her
",Lovesick for Mina
Cradle of Filth,"One dark afternoon like a shadow I flew
Through the rain that fell sick with lament
To this house of incest for when we undressed
Blasphemies against Venus were rent
Though her sister removed, her wet body approved
The parade of my heavenly quests
Yet all tongues are not true, some are forked or askew
Like an uncivil serpent's at best
For oustered from Eden I fausted all reason
Hook in mouth like saint Peter Pan
To haunt faery groves and hot virgin coves
Wherein the promiscuous swam 
I elected lovers and rejected others

And bonfires alit
And shooting stars portents of rips

A mere glimpse or murmur
From her precious celestial lips

With a turn of the screw
And a slip of the tongue

Advancing in fevers

Or will she burn?

She lights the skies
Dressed in silver scales plucked from the ocean
To spite her thighs
That Lucifer snuck inside
And with his pride
Enclaves were upgraded to Goshen
So paradise
Could shine from out her skirts

With ornaments to close the noose

Anaemic as the flag of truce
I raised at dawn to catch you in my spellâ??

With every twist I cannot resist her
Fertile female mind control

To whom I pour my wine and soul

And here we go again!

From a corpse of black pews
Where the moon was drawn through
Like a sword through a Gordian knot
She descended to me
Claiming swift victory
Over the heart I had near-soon forgot

With every kiss this huntress whispered:
â??Yield to my sweet embrace
One night of bliss.â?? I could not dismiss her
Once her beauty shot me a darker face

Surrendering branches that slenderly pleased

Terrified and drained
He sought his deep red velvet bed

Exhausted, forced into the dead
The creep of nightmares came again

Madness clouded everything
Like a lycanthropic shroud
And through it's ghastly lineaments he saw
Hundreds of slain children
Some came crawling disemboweled
To where he stretched out howling on all fours

Corpses tore at his legs and knees
As he clawed to the cross, begging reprieve
From a Lord that soared above the awful scene

He sobbed and wept, no voice was left

Her suit of pure white armor
Blazed against the English in a torrent of light

A cancer fled his soul
Dissolving

Aflame, a Valkyrie
She made him click without desire
And in his eyes she swam a Goddess

Will we shine amidst the brightest stars""

How will you know if the sky is burning?
Where will you be my darling?
How will you breathe when their wheels are turning?

Will you not flee and label me pariah?
Where will you be my darling?

Three times he'd glared before his judges
Darkening there
With a Wormwood mind
And a gullet of poison

Asked
He thought the court a farce
His tongue as sharp as glass
A bastard to the last
This truth assassin

Tautened his claws at the ruinous cast
Flexing vexation at clerics aghast
In uproar he caused the cross to be masked
And the hex of exile from God's Kingdom passed

Back in the mirror, shattered vanity died
The curse even clearer on the sanity side
Banished from the lavish tracts of paradise
From Heaven's shored poured to the sore divide

Their thunder sundered all his veils
Thickening there
His belligerent pulse
To a sickening crawl

Yes
He'd fostered wickedness
Fed vipers at his breast
Inflicted death's caress
So now to suffer

He'd burn, discern
That his second turn
Would last for eternity
In reckoning flames

That night his plight marched in demented Parades
O'er a rainbow of black magic scars
The blood ran to fear, turned to torment in spades

His epiphany struggled to come
But dawn found him there, redemptive, prepared
Like Christ to Golgotha, his face to the sun

All fears were smeared
When Joan had appeared
In a shower of tears
Last vestige of innocence

Yearning for her vision of divinity
Of her miracles and dreamt lyrical deeds

He would meet her at the pyre as the fire kissed
And together they'd climb to God, entwined in bliss

Devil may care
He awed the court with a sworn confession
Quickening there
His radiant death
And acute renewal

Shat out of Hell

He would have his vice!

Despite their raising not a single hair
Everything stank of witchcraft there

From the stained chapel to the statued lawn
In Caprineum on the lake
To the still lit crypts and the slit of dawn
Sliding down the towers, it all smelt fake

Now all was rich and tapestried
Fragrant wine to shitty mead
His new world opened with a claret flood

To etch the circles clear again

As a labyrinth of razors led a blind man to the stars
So too Prelati brought the dark

Imbibed with fire
They fed him shredded infants on an altar full of scars

Entangled in a dream
The mirrors full of steam

Lay blackened in a holy fog
And now there were only devils to pursue

As accusations reached a roar
Investigations breached the door
He put up nothing save his favors in defense

The grease had long been spent
Now all tongues spat at Tiffauges there
Ten leagues beneath contempt

Just one falter
One misplaced deed
And Gilles would be undone
As he teetered on the verge of defeat

Profaning God's altar
Bursting in on evening Mass
He threatened there to crucify the priest

Drunk on fiery wine
With the storm lashing behind
He then threw this Philistine
To his foulest dungeon

And money owed or not
The Priest released or left to rot
His blatant sacrilege begot
A war machine of papal Rome

They came for him in mourning splendor
With the blessing of the Saints
His fawning grin in sweet surrender
A lesson in enforced restraint

Cradle of Filth,"The world was her cloister, the abbess Duboir
In the convent at All Hallows fair
A pearl in an oyster she shone like a star
Augmenting her sisterhoods prayers
Her singing touched Angels and melted their hearts
her choirs inspired the search
For the lost holy grail, the Benedict arts
And the best of the Catholic Church

But if one thing
One precious little thing
Would darken this facade
There would be such consequences

Like the night Sister Victoria
Stepped in from the freezing cold
No candles would light at Evening Mass

The days passed by without a sigh
But dusk came thick with dread
Intangible, the air was full

Of wanderlust and approaching bloodshed

In truth, the Abbess with her pious whims
Enjoyed the new girl's pain
Proof to the rest tat the briars of sin
Entangled all the world in Satan's name

Victoria Varco, once heiress
To a proud noble estate
Fell pregnant by her recklessness
Who then fell foul to a violent fate
Such was here cime in expedient times
And the shame of besmirching her name
Her child was burnt, she was dragged to these walls
For a life in obedient chains

But not one thing
One precious little thing
Would darken this facade

Like the night Sister Victoria
Woke screaming in her room
She spent a week spiralling from heaven

And as the seasons wheezed and pained
Her dream grew more perverse
For no good reasons she would to find
An alluring woman naked save for jewels and verse

When here eyelids close, on a moonlit shore
This intoxicating beauty would appear
The sweetest symphony composed
Those abating lips rose
Tho whisper dirty secrets in her ear

Clandestine secrets

A dream within a dream
She finds herself this nymph
Abreast a desert dune
And below the crescent moon
Atop a darksome stranger

Ah, the spurting of his seed inside here
Triggers paradise
She rides the beast until the heavens trembled

Forcing eclipse, her lover licks her blood
That drips upon the sand
And almost out of hand
Coarse plots assemble

For somewhere in the convent walls
A templar treasure rests
Forgotten to the vestibules
Like pleasures of the flesh

So, in return for nightly runs
Past tongues and wisdom's hiss
She promised to assist the hunt
for an ancient golden chain amiss",The Nun With the Astral Habit
Cradle of Filth,"The Feast of Fools, 1308
As January slipped into the grip of winter
A leather leash tightened round the throat of fate

Amidst the flock, disease and dementia
Night was blighted more than ever before
With screams of lust and obscene adventure
And scenes of raw debauch

The darkness was aroused with every kiss
And all who fell under it's spell
Were one foul step from the abyss

One foul step from the abyss

Sacred village there in All Hallows Fair
Feared the templars and their Queen
For Lilith compared to a royal nightmare
When she steered their tempestuous

Fever-dreams

The beast was loose and beauty party
To the horrors of this sonorous whore
A seducer, Medusa
A frozen Hecate cloned

Stealing seed, here needs were like a cancer
Growing stronger with each whimpering dog
knelt before her, thirteen necromancers
Called from desert sands to this land of opportunity

The darkness was aroused with every kiss
And all who fell under its spell
Were one foul step from the abyss

One foul step from the abyss

love was drugged by a copious vendor
A train of servants for here decadent games
Purring on rugs in fugs of opiate splendor
Vain Lilith spread her wings again

Stars, they gasped and comets in ovation
Lit the towers, their very presence declared
They watch with lust, despair and veneration
For the Goddess scatted naked there

The painted eye of the storm

Plagues of sin, played to win
All hearts and souls in thrall
to her embraced, her fatal whims
Desire meant to conquer all

Until that fateful day, 1308
With a force blessed by the Kings of Hate
Facing winter gray to disintegrate
Once noble halls

The villagers in a belligerent horde
Fraught daughters fanning flames
Rose like pillars for their militant Lord
Thoughts of slaughter haranguing hot veins

They assailed the fort beyond the woods
as the howling broke on the stroke of midnight
Many lost their sanity at what they fought

Amidst those walls, creed of dementia
Annihilated by sheer weight of the surge
Put to the sword, freed from their calenture
The great estate was given straight to the church

Of Lilith, no limb ranked amongst the dead
But that she drank the blood of many men
That dark night it was said",One Foul Step From the Abyss
Cradle of Filth,"At the very start
There were whispers in the dark
And for all the world to see
There was witchcraft at its heart
And on the autumn air
The scent of bonfires everywhere
And a fell wind stirred the leaves

The persecution song

Telltale signs of possession
Little Miss Demeanour in the demons bed
Gasps she just could not suppress
After lights-out midst the dead
And a past on which sin cast its darts of wickedness

Time was running faster for disaster
Strange nights were burning
In the furnace of her dreams
A name was uttered, Lilith
Mistress, playmate, master
Such sights were stolen in the throes of ecstasy

And in the thick of all
In the Black Goddess's thrall
With the wood unseen for trees
Victoria stood tall
Promiscuous in step
The Devil breathing down her neck
As jealous zealots stitched apiece

The persecution song

Telltale signs of possession
Fickle Miss Demeanour hissed and disappeared
To her Sisters of the cloth
She now reeked of Astaroth
Again the curse had surfaced
Sneaking back the pagan years

Weaving webs of great revealing
Hidden in the convent
An evil libido abided, undone
Breathing, deceiving
Feasting on her deviant feelings
She'd clung to her crucifix
Once her torturers begun

Her screams came quick
The miserichord
Den to vice and screw
That had reddened many tongues
Wrung symphonies
Of suffering from her

Many moons hardened pure hearts
Those plagued by her black arts
Their rooms secreting phantom orgies
Vile rites and rifled graves

Mere hours, now towered
Above this bent and beaten flower
Her naked body privy to
The Abbess and her ways

Victoria fought
No guilt was wrought
Just a torrid retort of blasphemies
Nails and crosses vomited forth
From this pretty little whore now arched like Hell

Arched like Hell

At the very start
There were whispers in the dark
And for all the world to see
There was witchcraft at its heart
But then the end grew nigh
A dirge inferno filled the sky
In its customary key

The persecution song

Telltale signs of obsession
No wailing banshee would dishonor their name
Nuns dragged her to the blasted oak
Storm-clouds threatened holy smoke
They hanged her there like Judas
With the Hellcat in her reined

Time was running faster for disaster
Exorcism, torture, gallows
Now a shallow grave
A name was stuttered, Isaac
Tongue-tied, simple, bastard
They made him dig the pit
Mindless of what it claimed",The Persecution Song
Cradle of Filth,"She slept in ecstasy
In hands that fanned her wildest fantasies
Freed from Christ's frigid regime
And rigid nails

She was first in church
To lick her lips and self-debased
Each waking second felt like heaven
In the scarlet One's embrace

And at last, clear memories, aghast
Relinquished their control
All things held dear to the wretched past
Coalesced within her soul

Madness crept into her sight
Though her sinful hair
Spoke of nothing to the contrary
Once dulled eyes leaped alive with life
Her piece of broken mirror
Barely recognized

The worm was turning

For her sat grinning Victoria
Who, no three weeks ago
Was flogged red to euphoria
For her dour love of God
And the ardor of his crows

Cold cloisters kept the dead apart
At the Retreat of the Sacred Heart

She stepped in ecstasy
Neath skies that plied her wildest fantasies
Freed into love's reacquainted dream
And sudden gales

Night grew sultry late September
A man came from the village
Through the woods
To help with harvest
She was burning like the fields
All her vows lay unfulfilled
His name was Isaac, silent, blessed
A mute whose tongue impressed her lately

But now red skies darken
The roonks lament
Windswept maelstroms harken
The approach of Lilith's
Nightmare kingdom

The woman in her astral dreams
Became more vivid, livid, obscene
Scatted on the throne of oayx blasphemies
Emanating raw desire
And the surging urge to scream

Darkness crept into her face
She stood erect
And spook of riches and their whereabouts
Finding in Isaac the need to place
A hidden Templer necklace
Lest the month run out

For now stormed the vainglorious
In her palace of mass delight
Her power dawned victorious
Victoria the key, her mind unfastened
By flights of morbid fancy
Psychomancy, rites of ancient wrong
Sweet seductions, peaked corruptions
Spiking through impatient song

Cold cloister kept the dead apart
At The Retreat of the Sacred Heart

The gate to hell was forced apart
At The Retreat of the Sacred Heart",Retreat of the Sacred Heart
Cradle of Filth,"Poets racking absinthed brains
Could never fully paint these nights
No martyr parting from his pain
Could utter words so erudite
As those she now divulged to me
In throes of passions grip
Indulging latent fantasies
That ran forked tongues along the lip

Of fate's pudenda
The twisted snake's agenda
Now the world would bend
To her deadly legacy

Life's graveyard was waiting, such dizzying flight
From the convent at All Hallows Fair
Without contemplating, we fled through the night
Too blood-drunk and cunt-sated to care

The Goddess had spoken
And woken desire
It crackled in the air around us
A psychic force shimmering like fire

And on her breasts. that old necklace
The one I snuck from the fucked Abbess
Whose dirty little secret, other than me
Now shone with bold intensity

Vast the power it possessed
The darkness Brought to living flesh

This treasure was ancient, taken by force
From an elite caste of priests in Delphi
The Templars were patient, they stayed out the course
Then fleeced their Greek hosts in their sleep

That necklace traversed
Vile murders and miles worse
But what was a curse
To this perverse demoness?

Legend swore it was a gift of malice
For the maiden Harmonia
The illegitimate spawn of love arid war
Jealousy made it gleam for her
For with it clasped, her looking glass
Was ever beautiful and young
But disaster choked her royal caste
And every throat on which it hung
There madness, death and horror clung

Immortalised in mortal guise
She was a sight for blighted eyes
A plague to gladly plagiarize
And spread like red excited kisses

She was more than me
More than wards
Could fulfill in the parlance of the angels
She cast a spell on every cell
In my nobody
She gave me back my tongue
That she might run it on herself

She was Lilith. she was light
I was but a parasite
Beckoned to temptation
In her velvet overtones
Through frozen antics, dressed in white
She led me into paradise
Neath comets in ovation
Like the Queen of winter, throned...

Pleasures archetypal
Then much rarer agonies
I was a sworn disciple
Of her whims and dark decrees

In Europe's hair
Her spies were everywhere
A sylph amongst the filthy rich and debonair
Her greater plan
All chaos and the all of man
For as she fed dark appetites
She bred her children there

The spawn of love and war

Presiding over Hellfire clubs
Arch-masons and Agharta

The spawn of love and war

She rode the beast. her legs apart
A blazing pyre starter

Life's playground elated, such dizzying sights
And sensations ignited her grin
As slaves celebrated her Satanic rites
We climbed up to heaven in sin

She came to me
As she will come to You
Intoxicating in her seduction
Her siren sway. devastating voodoo

Persistent, resistance is useless, fool
To this Goddess, in lust she's cruel

Beyond any measure, her pleasures will found

Somewhere that we could speak? 
If there is time, could we still find, 
Piece of mind, some kind of love, my love? 

But if you stay, 
I know I'd throw it all away, 
And if you go, 
I know I'll find my way back home. 

You say I give it all away, 
Leave nothing to imagination, 
Well it's all I know, although I know, 
You don't want everything, my love.

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night

That pit-apats through my brain;
So darn persistent,
The day isn't distant
When it'll drive me insane.

Comes in the morning
Without any warning,
And hangs around me all day.
I'll have to sneak up to it
Someday, and speak up to it.
I hope it listens when I say

Fascinating Rhythm,
You've got me on the go!
Fascinating Rhythm, 
I'm all a-quiver.

What a mess you're making!

Why I'm always shaking

Start a-hopping,
Never stopping 
O find at night no work has been done.

I know that
Once it didn't matter 
But now you're doing wrong
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy.
Won't you take a day off?
Decide to run along
Somewhere far away off 
And make it snappy!

Oh, how I long to be the man I used to be!

With never a sigh
Don't need what money can buy.

Happy with my lot.
How do I get that way ?
Look at what I've got

I got rhythm
I got music
I got my maingirl
Who could ask for anything more ?
I got daisies
In green pastures,
I got my maingirl
Who could ask for anything more ?

I don't mind him.
You won't find him
'Round my door.

Craig Bohmler,"All you preachers
Who delight in panning the dancing teachers,
Let me tell you there are a lot of features
Of the dance that carry you through
The gates of Hea-ven.

It's madness
To be always sitting around in sadness,
When you could be learning the steps of gladness.
You'll be happy when you can do
Just six or seven;

Begin to day!
You'll find it nice,
The quickest way to paradise.
When you practise,
Here's the thing to know,
Simply say as you go...

[Chorus]
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day !
I'm gonna get there at any price;
Stand aside, I'm on my way !
I've got the blues
And up above it's so fair.
Shoes ! Go on and carry me there !
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day.

Every new step
Helps a bit ; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven.
Get bu-sy ;
Dance with Maud the countess, or just plain Lizzy:
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.
When you've learn'd to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out.

In time you'll get Saint Vitus dance,
Which beats the latest thing from France.
Take no chances on this Paradise ;
Let me give you advice.

Craig Bohmler,"When the mellow moon begins to beam,
Every night I dream a little dream,
And of course Prince Charming is the theme,
The he for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along,
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong,
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand,
And in a little while,
He'll take my hand,
And though it seems absurd,
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not,
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two,
From which I'll never roam,
Who would, would you?
And so all else above
I'm waiting for the man I love.","The Man I Love, song (from Strike Up the Band, 1st version; orig. composed"

What am I gonna do if you turn me down

And make us one, and make us one

And nowhere to go
And all night to get there

Nights like these go by so fast
So, lay your head on my shoulder and put your hand in mine

She snuck out in that cotton dress
Jumped on in and we drove to the lake
Put her hand on my knee and said I can't wait
I had everything we needed in the bed of my truck
Turns out my baby loves to

Fish, she wants to do it all the time
Early in the morning, in the middle of the night
She's hooked and now she can't get enough
Man, that girl sure loves to fish

After that that's all she wanted to do
But that was okay 'cause I did too
She always wants to go down by the dam
And I love how she looks with that rod in her hand
If they ain't bitin' she don't give up

I love to see her silhouette reflectin' off the water
With her hooks and her sinkers and her pretty pink bobbers
The first time I saw her I knew I was in love
'Cause I found a girl who loves to

Fish, I love to see her lyin'
There on the bank 'neath the full moon light

In this little country bar
This old boy in the corner watched me
Tune up my guitar
He said, ""What kinda music do you play hoss?
I play some myself""
He said, ""I sure hope it's country
These days it's hard for me to tell""

You can talk to me about tractors
Cowboy boots and pickup trucks
Ol' cane poles and dirt roads
And spittin' Skoal in a Dixie cup
You can tell me about your Grandpa
And how he turned you onto Hank
If you gotta tell me how country you are
You probably ain't

He said, Country is a way of life
That's almost gone
It's more than the clothes you wear
Or how you sing a song
It's about being honest
And working hard
Looking someone in the eye
Being who you say you are
