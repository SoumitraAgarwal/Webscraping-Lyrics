Johnny Philko,"What about me? Mr. President 
All of my money 
I done spent 
I prayed to the Lord 
But nothin's been sent 

Can't you see 
I'm down at your feet 
About like a dog 
Beggin' for a scrap of meat 

I'm counting on you 
To carry me through 

What about them Lord 
They can't pay their rent 
Maybe they should all go out 
And live in a tent 

The answers unkind 
It could blow your mind 
What about me? Mr. President",What About Me? (Mr. President)
Johnny Powers,"Well, I get rattled every time we meet
I get rattled even in my sleep
I get rattled, baby, over you

I get twisted, I get turned around
I get twisted, and I'm up then I'm down
I get twisted, baby, over you

Well, baby, baby, baby won't you save one night for me
Baby, baby, baby is there something wrong with you
Baby, baby, baby this is out of my control
It may look like nothing's wrong but deep down in my soul
I'm twisted - shaken - rattled
I get rattled, baby, over you

Rattled baby, over you

Johnny Powers,"Well if you see somebody knocking on your door
If you see somebody crawling out across the floor
Baby, it'll be me
And I'll be looking for you

If you see somebody in your living room hall
If you see somebody crawling up a totem pole
Baby, it'll be me
And I'll be looking for you

I'll be searching in the mountains
In the deep blue sea
Well I'll be looking in the fountains
I'll be climbing every tree

If you see something happening on a fishing hook
If you see a funny face in a comic book
Baby, it'll be me
I'll be looking for you

Johnny Preston,"SPOKEN:A ho ho ho......It was the night before Christmas and 
everthing was real quiet. So I thought I'd take myself a little 
walk at Christmas Eve Night. I was makin' it on down the street, 
when to my surprise I saw this little bitty cat with big old 
tears in his eyes. Now I could see he was standin' in front of 
this music store and looked real brought down. I could hear what 
he was sayin', he didn't know I was around...he say.....

I want a rock an' roll guitar
With a big bass string
I want a rock an' roll guitar
So I can play the thing

I wanna be on t.v.
Like a rock an' roll star
I want Santa Claus to bring me
A rock an' roll guitar

SPOKEN: ha ha ha.....so-a I walked over to him-a 'cause I understand.
I, I thought I'd cheer him up so I say, ""Look-a-here little man,
A-you don't want no rock an' roll guitar, you want a six gun like
the Lone Ranger has, so you can run around sayin'-a hi ho Silver,
Kimo sabe, and all that cowboy jazz. Or how would you like old Santa 
to bring you a little dump truck so you could go around a-dumpin' 
things"".....And he say, ""Man, I don't want no dumptruck, I want 
somethin' that swings"".....He say.....

I want a rock an' roll guitar
With a big bass string
I want a rock an' roll guitar

I say. I say, hold on there little fellow, ah why don't you be like 
the little chicks and cats and wish for a space helmet or a 
rocketship or something wild like that? And you know what he say? He 
say.....""Look here dad, I don't want no plane or no train or nothin' 
square like that, that ain't the lick for me. Wwhen I awake this 
whole place is gonna shake, 'cause you know what I want under my 
Christmas tree!""....He say.....

Well, rock-a-bye baby, in the treetop
When the wind blows the cradle will rock
So rock-a-bye baby, in the treetop
When the wind blows, mmm

Well, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack jumped over the candlestick
He jumped so high up above
He landed in the cradle of love

The cow jumped over the moon
And on the way down she met a turtle dove
Said ""Let's go rockin' in the cradle of love""

To get a pail of water

Johnny Preston,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Johnny Q Public,"Stay here and keep watch over me as I pray
My soul is overwhelmed, death becomes me
Watch and pray that you will not fall into temptation
The spirit is willing, but the body is weak, so weak
I fall to my face in the garden

Father keep me in Your presence
Don't let me fall away
For my lack of understanding
is impatient and demanding
and asking why this way
As I pray
My friend, do what you came here for
Then desert your faith
pass me into the hands of sinners
With a kiss I am betrayed
I am betrayed, I am betrayed

Life's why you won't take this cup away, away

I don't dig the radio
I hate what the charts pick

All over the world, disc jockeys talk insane

The Rolling Stones are trillionaires
The flower children pallbearers
Beatles said ""All You Need is Love""

",Here I Am
Johnny Reid,"

Seemd everytime things are looking up

The sky comes crashing down

Seems everytime we spread our wings

We're chained to the ground

These troubled times never seem to fade away

But it won't be long 'till these dark clouds reveal better days


I promise you

Whatever we run into

As sure as I am I'll never let go of your hand

I promise you we'll fly up in sky's of blue

Our love will pull us through I promise you


With innocence lost where do you run

To get out of the storm

Dry your tears the only shelter you need

Is right in my arms

Take a deep breath and just hold on to me believe

You belong in the sun now baby right here next to me


I promis you

Whatever we run into

As sure as I am I'll never let go of your hand

I promise you we'll fly up in sky's of blue

Our love will pull us through I promise you


Take a deep breath and just hold on to me, believe

You belong in the sun now baby right here next to me


I promise you

Whatever we run into

As sure as I am I'll never let go of your hand

I promise you we'll fly up in sky's of blue

Our love with pull us through I promise you...


",I Promise You
Johnny Reid,"Ain't it funny how life 
Is measured in time 
Ain't it funny how fate 
Never leaves it too late 
I heard a heavenly song 
I started singing along 
Still I can't believe 
That you sent her here to me 

She fell from the sky 
Right into my life 
Through a hole in the clouds 
All her friends were looking down 
I found her crying in the rain 
Well I helped her mend her wings 
When she never flew back 
Lord, I knew for a fact 
That you were missing an angel 

Well Is she here to save us all 
Or just to catch me when I fall 
Is she part of your plan 
To make me a better man 
Every night I say a prayer 
That in the morning she'll be there 
And if I die before I wake 
Chalk it up to give and take 

She fell from the sky 
Right into my life 
Through a hole in the clouds 
All her friends were looking down 
I found her crying in the rain 
Well I helped her mend her wings 
When she never flew back 
Lord, I knew for a fact 
That you were missing an angel 

When she never flew back 
Lord, I knew for a fact 
That you were missing an angel 

Missing an angel",Missing An Angel
Johnny Reid,"

Here I am an this road

Thousand miles from her

There's an echo in my soul

Like waves against her shores

She's the place that I go

When I find myself alone

With her fields of purple heather

And her fences made of stone

She calls me home


Something that I always felt inside

A dream I had to chase

And a mountain I just had to climb

To see what's on the other side

It doesn't really matter how lost I get

Or how far I roam

She calls me home


She's the comstant strength in my restless heart

She's the reason why

I got this far in the first place

Her voice rings clear in the back of my mind

When I can't go on

She calls me home


She calls me home


There's only one place where my roots run deep

There's only one place where I can swing

In my family tree

I know what it means to me

It doesn't matter how lost I get

Or how far I roam

She calls me home..


",She Calls Me Home
Johnny Reid,"

Sixty to Zero:

She had blue eyes, the colour

Of Amarillo skies in summer

And when we'd fly

Her hair would wrap around me


The smell of leather and gasoline

A little danger sitting next to me

And when I was with her

Man, I never felt so alive


Sky was red, I was green

Road was black, seventeen

She was fast, I was slow

She was all I could hold

Summer flew, she was gone

Little did I know my heart could go

From sixty to zero


We'd sit in my car night after night

Watchin' the stars as they flew by

We'd go 'round the world at the speed of light

And never turn the key


Still I wonder where she might be

And if she ever stops and thinks about me

'Cause God knows

I sure think about her


(Repeat Chorus)


Sixty to zero


We loved and laughed enough to last a lifetime

But at least for a little while she was mine


(Repeat Chorus)

To never fall again
I put up a defence
And I let nobody in
How can I forgive
The way you left my heart
How can I forget
When I'm reminded by a scar

And how do I erase a tear
That's fallen on my page
I don't know where we went wrong
But I know this ain't no love song
Yeah I know this ain't no love song
But I wish it was

there's no one here to blame
So I guess it's up to me
To look the other way
Even though it's hard to see


And how do I erase a tear
That's fallen on my page
I don't know where we went wrong
But I know this ain't no love song
Yeah I know this ain't no love song

It all started with the warmth of your kiss 
I got a fever runnin' with passion 
Never thought love could get hotter than this

And then you turned it up another notch 
Ain't nothin' like the power of a women's touch
Can you feel my pulse oh what a rush
You got me thinkin' like the devil in the name of love

You took my farther than I've been before
And when I thought I couldn't take any more
You turned it up

I'm like a rock lyin' in the desert
After the rain just soakin' up steam
You're like the sun bearin' down upon me
Just when I thought I could finally stand the heat

Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true
You've started back doin' the things you used to do

The Cadillac pulled up ahead of the Ford
The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more
It then got cloudy and started to rain
I honked my horn for a passin' lane
The rainwater blowin' all under my hood
I knew that I was doin' my motor good

Why can't you be true
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true

Oh, Maybellene

The heat went down, the motor cooled
And that's when I heard that highway sound
The Cadillac asittin' like a ton of lead
A hundred and ten half a mile ahead
The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still
And I caught Mabellene at the top of the hill

Johnny Rivers,"Long distance information, give me Memphis Tennessee
Help me find a party that tried to get in touch with me
She did not leave a number but I know who placed the call
'Cause my uncle took a message and he wrote it on the wall

Help me, information, get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd call me here from Memphis Tennessee
Her home is on the south side, high upon a ridge
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi bridge

Last time I saw Marie she was wavin' me goodbye
With ""hurry-home"" drops on her cheek that trickled from her eye
We were pulled apart because her mom did not agree
She tore apart our happy home in Memphis Tennessee

Help me, information, more than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her and all the fun we had
Marie is only six years old, information please
You got to put me through to her in Memphis Tennessee",Memphis

A paper in her hand

To try to free her man

Night after night I'm a-standing here alone
Weepin' my heart out till cold gray dawn
Prayin' that you're lonely and you come here too
Hoping just by chance that I'll get a glimpse of you
Tryin' hard to find you, somewhere up above
High on a mountain of love

A mountain of love, a mountain of love, you should be ashamed
We used to be a mountain of love
But you just changed your name

Way down below there's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple
Inside a church there's an altar filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringin' and they shoulda been ours
That's why I'm so lonely, my dreams gone above

I've known of your, your secluded nights
I've even seen her maybe once or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection?
But this time before you leave my arms
And rush off to her charms
(think it over) haven't I been good to you?
(think it over) haven't I been sweet to you?

Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over

I've tried so hard, hard to be patient
Hoping you'll stop this infatuation
But each time you are together
I'm so afraid I'll be losing you forever

Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart",Stop! In the Name of Love

With every move he makes another chance he takes
Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow

Ah, be careful what you say

Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
I'm a poorman's son, from across the railroad tracks
The only shirt I own is hangin' on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy 
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while 
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new 
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
I'm a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised 
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
No one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poorman's son
She says give her the things that money can buy 
But I'll never, never make my baby cry
And it's all right, what I can't do
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby ev'rything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight

We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night

Johnny Smith,"What's new?
How is the world treating you?
You haven't changed a bit
Handsome as ever I must admit

What's new?
How did that romance come through?
We haven't met since then
Gee, but it's nice to see you again

What's new?
Probably I'm boring you
But seeing you is grand
And you were sweet to offer your hand
I understand

Adieu
Pardon my asking what's new
Of course you couldn't know
I haven't changed
I still love you so

Johnny Smith,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Seem to be happening again

But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""

You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",Ghost of a Chance

Sweetheart, when you are not near

Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?
I'm happy when I'm with you

Stars are smiling at me from your eyes
Sunbeams now there will be in the skies
Tell me that you will be true
That will all depend on you

Days I knew as happy
Sweet sequester days

Johnny Smith,"Once I laughed when I heard you saying
That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind

And once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself
Now I even have to scratch my back myself

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again

You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise

Johnny Smith,"I've never met you, yet never doubt, dear;
I can't forget you, I've thought you out, dear.
I know your profile and I know the way you kiss,
Just the things I miss on a night like this.
If dreams are made of imagination
I'm not afraid of my own creation.
With all my heart, my heart is here for you to take.
Why should I quake? I'm not awake.

Isn't it romantic?
Music in the night, a dream that can be heard.
Isn't it romantic?

Moving shadows write the oldest magic word.
I hear the breezes playing in the trees above
While all the world is saying you were meant for love.
Isn't it romantic
Merely to be young on such a night as this?
Isn't it romantic?
Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.
Sweet symbols in the moonlight,
Do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?
Isn't it romance?

My face is glowing, I'm energetic.
The art of sewing I found poetic.
My needle punctuates the rhythm of romance.
I don't give a stitch if I don't get rich.
A custom tailor who has no custom
Is like a sailor, no one will trust 'em.
But there is magic in the music of my shears.
I shed no tears, lend me your ears.

Isn't it romantic?
Soon I will have found some girl that I adore.
Isn't it romantic?
While I sit around my love can scrub the floor.
She'll kiss me every hour or she'll get the sack
And when I take a shower she can scrub my back.
Isn't it romantic?
On a moonlight night she'll cook me onion soup.
Kiddies are romantic
And if we don't fight we soon will have a troupe.
We'll help the population,
It's a duty that we owe to dear old France.
Isn't it romance?",Isn't It Romantic?

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew

From my tender sentimental woes

A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much

A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in
Open up your heart and let this fool rush in!!",Fools Rush In

The green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.
'Twas so good to be young then, in a season of plenty,
When the catfish were jumpin' as high as the sky.

A time just for plantin', a time just for ploughin'.
A time to be courtin' a girl of your own.
'Twas so good to be young then, to be close to the earth,
And to stand by your wife at the moment of birth.

A time just for livin', a place for to die.

Johnny Smith,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?
Johnny Smith,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you
",I'm Getting Sentimental over You
Johnny Smith,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring

It might as well be Spring",It Might as Well Be Spring

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall

She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.

Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love

That thrills and delights me, oh no

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

Oh, you crazy moon, what did you do?
And when they kissed, 
They tried to say that it was just in fun
Oh, you crazy moon, look what you've done

Once you promised me, you know, that it would never end
You should be ashamed to show your funny face, my friend

There they are, they fell in love, 
I guess you think that you're smart

Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?

Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much

Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me

Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine

Johnny Smith,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

Johnny Smith,"You know I peeked in to say goodnight,
When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair.

A fair ground's painted swings

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

When it sure got to be a shame when you start to scream and shout
You got to contradict all those times you were butterflyin' about

(You were butterflyin')
All about that personality crisis you got it while it was hot
But now frustration and heartache is what you got
Break

And you're a prima ballerina on a Spring afternoon
Change on into the wolfman, howlin' at the moon, hooowww

All about that personality crisis you got it while it was hot
But now frustration and heartache is what you got

Now with all the crossin' fingers that mother nature says
Your mirrors get jammed up with all your friends

That personality everything starts to blend
Personality when your mind starts to blend
Personality impression of a friend,
Of a friend, of a friend, of a friend, of a friend
Personality wonderin' how celebrities ever met
(Look and find out on television)

Personality crisis you got it while it was hot
Frustration and heartache is all you got, don't you worry
Personality crisis please don't cry
It's just a personality crisis, please don't stop

Because you walk a personality

Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
I guess I never told you
That I am so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second best

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance

Johnny Tillotson,"I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches
Papa used to tease me about it
'Cause deep down inside he was hurt
'Cause he'd done all he could

My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hands, see
Education he never had
He did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made

For, life had kick him down to the ground
When he tried to get up
Life would kick him back down
One day Papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders
And in his tears he said

He said, Patches
I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you

Two days later Papa passed away, and
I became a man that day
So I told Mama I was gonna quit school, but
She said that was Daddy's strictest rule

So every mornin' 'fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave, just run away from home
But I would remember what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed

He said, Patches
I'm dependin' on you, son
I tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest

Then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of 13 I thought
I was carryin' the weight of the
Whole world on my shoulders
And you know, Mama knew
What I was goin' through, 'cause

Every day I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
You see, I was the oldest of the family
And everybody else depended on me
Every night I heard my Mama pray
Lord, give him the strength to make another day

So years have passed and all the kids are grown
The angels took Mama to a brand new home
Lord knows, people, I shedded tears
But my daddy's voice kept me through the years

Sing,
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you

Oh, I can still hear Papa's voice sayin'
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest

I can still hear Papa, what he said
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you",Patches

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet

Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain, Telling me just what a fool I've been. I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain, And let me be alone again. Now the only girl I've ever loved has gone away. Looking for a brand new start! But little does she know that when she left that day. Along with her she took my heart. Rain, please tell me, now does that seem fair For her to steal my heart away when she don't care I can't love another, when my heart's somewhere far away. Rain, won't you tell her that I love her so Please ask the sun to set her heart aglow Rain in her heart and let the love we know start to grow.

Then if it don't work out then if it don't work out

Where love once was, now nothing is there
You once lived for me, but now you don't care
If love is war baby nothings fair

You left me with a hunger Thai time won't erase

I believed in you, you were the only one
Looking back I was better off playing with a loaded gun

Love can be so cruel
Love can take you for a fool
Love can be blind, if you think love is true
It'll open your eyes oh baby 
Love can be so cruel, love can be cruel

Two different minds look through two sets of eyes
And two different hearts, living two separate lives
We just can't agree, so we stop asking why
Cause sometimes the truth hurts more than the lie
It's over now and we can't pretend (can't pretend)
Same thing that made us happy 
Makes us cry in the end

Johnny Western,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Why can't I be like the kind that don't mind

If you just take hold of my hand now
Make the mountains scream, drive my brain machine
But you don't seem to understand now

Turn me inside out and upside down
Take me down low
But you keep it hidden deep inside
So it's got nowhere to go

Don't hide your love
Don't hide your love
Don't hide the love that you're afraid to feel
That's a low down dirty deal

You got miles and miles of deep-sea smiles
But I never seen them surface
You got this and that and the other thing
But you don't realize their purpose

How can you be so damn naive?
You cause me some frustration
You keep it under lock and key
Why don't you try my combination?

Don't you hide your love
Don't hide your love
Don't you hide your love that you're afraid to feel
That's a low down dirty deal

Johnny Winter,"Once upon a time, you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People'd call, say, ""Beware doll, you're bound to fall""
You thought they were all kiddin' you

You used to laugh about everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud, now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal

How does it feel, how does it feel
To be on your own with no direction home?
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone

You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
Don't you know you only used to get juiced in it?
Nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
Now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it

You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say,""Do you want to make a deal?""

How does it feel, how does it feel
To be without a home, with no direction home?
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone

You never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns
When they all came down and did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You should never let other people get your kicks for you

You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at?
After he's taken everything he could steal

How does it feel, how does it feel
To be without a home, with no direction home?
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
Drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts and things
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe

You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, and you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal

How does it feel, how does it feel
To be without a home, with no direction home?
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone

I thought Lord, please stop her, ain't gonna get drunk no mo'

I hollered out my window, ""Come back baby please don't go""

I could hear her tell her mother, ""That's one no good man!""

Johnny Winter,"It had rained for 3 days straight
But the sun was beginning to shine
Two riders were approachin?
But they were no friends of mine.

Called out for Hanna
And I kept here close to my side
Whistled for old Thunder
And my horse he was ready to ride

CHORUS:
I give you everything I had babe
Ain?t that kindness
I give you the good with the bad babe
Ain?t that kindness
Don?t cha know I give you my love when say babe
Ain?t that kindness
Hmmm ya know a man ain?t nothing without his gun
Ya know a man ain?t nothing without his gun

2nd Verse:
Took to the road 6 night and days
Only then did we think it was safe
Heard the sound of 2 men approachin?
But they did not hesitate 

Hanna she was cryin?
But she wouldn?t let go of my leg
Thunder he was tired
Been a thinkin? of a better day

Repeat Chorus:

3rd Verse:
Two shots fired and two figures fell
There was blood flowin? over the ground
Two men dead in the noon day sun
And they never ever made a sound

Hanna she never forgave me
And I think I know the reason why
When I called out for Thunder
The horse he up and died.

We can dance all day

Johnny Winter,"As time begins to burn itself upon me
And the days are growing very short
People try their hardest to reject me
But in a way, their conscience won't be caught

Something's happen to me day by day
My pebble on the beach is getting washed away
Given everything that was mine to give
Now I'll turn around and find that there's no time to live

So often, I have seen that big wheel of fortune
Spinning for the man, who holds the ace
There's many that would change their places for him
But none of them have ever seen his lonely face

Something is happening to me day by day
My pebble on the beach is getting washed away
Given everything that was mine to give
And now I'll turn around and find that there's no time to live",No Time to Live
Johnny Winter,"Woke up inside myself this morning, uncertainty all around
Got straight and turned on to some happiness, then I lay back down, all there was around
Nothing left but ashes, and the smell

Went down to the corner drug store, the pain was more than I could bare
They told me that I was illegal, I told them I don't care, let them stand and stare
Nothin' left but old bones, and the smell

I know I can't go on, I just can't stand the pain, can't stand the pain,
I know I just can't stand 
Guess I'll go insane, go insane

Guess I was born to be mistreated, contentment seems too hard to find
Searchin' for some understandin', then I lost my mind, left it far behind
Nothing left but memories, and the smell",Nothing Left

With eyes so big I hoped you'd see,
You begged for grace, you left no grace for me

Johnnyswim,"Right 'round the corner
Down by the canyon
I met a man who lost his way.

He said I'm the son
Of a sailor
Who never showed me his face.

But daddy's gone.
And my momma met a maker
Oh to hell with that place.

So I said quit your talking
Your sideways walking
Time to find another path to take.

Quit your wining
Your blood-shot crying
Faking like you're dying never pays.

Just go home.
You need you some home.
Oh you need you some home.

Her name was Peggy Sue.
And her daddy hung the moon.
In her eyes, he could do no wrong.

But then he started drinking
Like there's a message in the bottle.
Now daddy's painting Peggy black and blue.

She closes her eyes
Through the hero's demise.
Holds to her hope beyond the sky.

She takes a breath.
Weight comes off her chest.
She finds a way to weather through the storm.

She cried out home.
I need me some home.
Oh I need some home.
(Some home)

I found myself on a train to California.
At twenty-five years of age.
Set beside me was a lonely rose of wanderer.
Two's always better they say.

So we made our plans.
She gave me a hand.
We ain't go no time for looking back.

I was bruised and beaten.
Lost for many reasons.
Only love would make you understand.

I'll build them a house where their dreams can come true
Just let me

Stuck in the rain in Central Park
Driving down Sunset Boulevard
When you're there in my arms

And all I ask for you to do is to turn it, turn it up
C'mon

Saturday night off in Katana
All these girls dressed in Gabbana
Spotted one I've never seen
(Did ya come along?)
It's so lovely just to see ya
Even lovelier to meet ya
Won't you let me buy ya drink?
(What ya sippin' on?)
Now, baby, I'll be honest
When I first saw ya
I couldn't help but think about
What you were like in bed
I ain't tryin' ta sweat ya
I know that I just met ya
But would you agree if I said
We need to...

(Be alone)
My car is right outside
(Be alone)
And it ain't too far of a drive
Over to my place
I know all the right songs to play
'Cause I tell you

[Chorus]
It ain't nothin' like makin' all kind a love
To some music
Turn the music up
Tongue kissin' and huggin'
Touchin' and rubbin'
To that music
Turn the music up

So if you love that Maxwell
(Turn it up, turn it up)
How about some Jodeci?
(Turn it up, turn it up)
Bump and Grind to R. Kelz
All you gotta do is say
J, turn it up

Now we off up in the ride
Crusin' down sunset
Girl, you see T-Pond
Is smellin' so good to me
I wanna love you to Usher
'Cause I know you need it nice and slow
I'm like Ginuwine
You got me (so anxious)
So let me play Tyrese
For my sweet lady
Now I know just what Jan meant
When she said
It's funny how time flies

[Chorus]

I hear some Mary J.
(Turn it up, turn it up)
I know you diggin' Faith
(Turn it up, turn it up)
Don't Alicia got it goin' on
(Turn it up, turn it up)
All you gotta do is say 
J, turn it up

Now I'm grown, girl
And if I hit you with a dick one time
You'll be gone, girl
Let's get it on, girl
We'll let the Marvin Gay play
While J do it all night long, girl
I'm in the zone, girl
Turn up your radio
And I guarantee that you'll hear one of my songs, girl
I write hits, gotta crib wit' a elevator in it
Ain't drop one single of my own, girl
Well, back to the groove
Fill the patron more
Baby, you want more
And I'm built to last
Slow motion or fast
We'll have a blast
Get spots you ain't even know you had
Now here's an idea
We ain't waitin' for the crib
Pull over the 550
Let's do it right here
And it seemin' like a dope fiend need a little more in love 
So, baby, turn it up

[Chorus]

One time for Jagged Edge
(Turn it up, turn it up)
And, girl, I know you like 112
(Turn it up, turn it up)
And Luther is the best
(Turn it up, turn it up)
So all you gotta do is say 
J, turn it up

Joja Wendt,"I like to tinkle on an old piana
I like to play it in a subtle mannah
I get a lot of pleasure
With a spano' keys
Underneath my finger tips
Tricklin' off o' my lips

A handful of keys
And a song to sing
Now how could you ask for more?
Than ticklin' the ivory
Singin' jive
I repeat what I said before

I like to sing a little tune that's mellah
I like to vocalize
There's nothin' swellah
I love to have a supple melody
Just tricklin' off o' my lips

A handful of keys
And a song to sing
Now how could you ask for more?
Than ticklin' the ivory
Singin' jive
I repeat what I said before

I like to tinkle on an old piana
I like to play it in a subtle mannah
I know I'll always be the top banana

You say the words but boy it donât feel right
What do you expect me to say
You know itâs just too little too late
You take my hand, and you say youâve changed
But boy you know your begging donât fool me
Because to you itâs just a game
You know itâs just too little too late

So let me on now
Cause time has made me strong
Iâm starting to move on
Iâm gonna say this now
Your chance has come and gone
And you know

Itâs just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I canât wait
But you know all the right things to say
You know itâs just too little too late
You say you dream of my face
But you donât like me, you just like the chase
To be real it doesnât matter anyway
You know itâs just too little too late

Itâs just too little too late

I was young and in love
I gave you everything but it wasnât enough
And now you wanna communicate
You know itâs just too little too late
Go find someone else
In letting you go Iâm loving myself
You got a problem but donât come asking me for help
Cause you know

Itâs just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I canât wait
But you know all the right things to say
You know itâs just too little too late
You say you dream of my face
But you donât like me, you just like the chase
To be real it doesnât matter anyway
You know itâs just too little too late

I can love with all of my heart
Baby I know I have so much to give (I have so much to give)
With a player like you
I donât have a prayer
Thatâs the way to live

Itâs just too little too late

Itâs just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I canât wait

You know itâs just too little too late

I'm his one and only, nothing less
You don't want to take it there

He told me he loves me
Calls me his breezy

Let me break it down, break it down
I got it on lock and
I think you better stop
I heard you been checking for my boo
Who do you think he is, busy giving your best shot
But you couldn't get a call back
And even after all that
Caught you at the mall for a throwback
That's big pimping but you
Wouldn't listen, he's mine
Not yours but a fall back

Remember that it's me that he loves

It was everything that I dreamed of
He was my gem and I was his pearl
Nothing could come between us
A prince charming to call my own

And left me wondering all alone

Used to believe in fairy tales (In fairy tales)

There's no such thing as fairy tales

Is a good story supposed to end
Unhappily ever after
Just as wonderful as it begins
And carry on for a few chapters
Baby how come each time I open up
I can't seem to get past stage one
I guess it's time for me to close up
And go back on the shelf because I'm done

Why do my dreams seem so far (Why they seem so far)
Up above the world so high
Won't somebody tell me why (Can you help me)
Can you help me out
Can you tell me what love is all about
Cause I never known it for myself (Don't believe in fairy tales)
That's why I don't believe in fairy tales no more

Used to believe in love (No more)

Into big things, he's a baller now

Something about it feels so right (That's why)
I think he wants to be my baby, baby

Under covers talking on the phone
Here comes my mother
It's way too late
Might get in trouble
My heart can't wait (So much to take)
Writing till my hand cramps up
4 pages saying I'm in love (more than a crush)

Can't get you off my mind (Come pick me up baby)

Young girl sittin' on the steps of her duplex (mmmm)
Why you gotta choose to make my life so complex
Breathing to the beat of a slow, sad drum
Trouble leaves some moments for some fun
I can almost guarantee you
It'll get better todaaaaaayyy

JoJo,"Never been in love 
Cause a girl like me 
Never had someone to care for

Someone special for me

And now I'm all in love

Someone to care for me
And there will never be

No more lonely
No more just me
Been there before
Ain't going no more

Whatever it is that you do when you do what you doing

With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do

Your love is so sweet, it knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak

But your love is strong, it keeps on holdin' on

Ready to do whatever's clever
Put on a show
Don't really matter, we can chop, chop, chop it up

Whatever you like, I'm on the same side

Roll out with my shades low
Get some of that ol' you know, good ol', good ol'

We'll beat the traffic
And I know all the back streets
We can take the alleys, baby, there's no hurry

I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave everything that I had
But ya left me in the cold

But still I have faith
Somehow I believe
That if I keep love in my heart
It will find it's way to me

I could fight
Seek revenge
But that's not who I am
No, I'm not givin' in
I will rise above

I'm gonna keep walkin'
Though it may seem far
I'm gonna keep preachin'
Even when life seems hard
Not gonna let you bring me down
I'm gonna take the high road

I'm gonna keep climbin'
Till I see the top
I'm gonna keep drivin'
Though I may get lost
Not gonna let you bring me down
I take the high road

I'm gonna get by on the high road
Yes, I will
I'm gonna get by on the high road

This pain that I feel
I will overcome
I know somewhere deep down inside
It's the pain that makes us strong
I could curse
I could shout
Take the easy way out
I forgive you
Somehow I will rise above

I'm gonna keep walkin'
Though it may seem far
I'm gonna keep preachin'
When life gets hard
Not gonna let you bring me down
I take the high road

I'm gonna keep climbin'
Till I see the top
I'm gonna keep drivin'
Though I may get lost
Not gonna let you bring me down
I take the high road

I get by

I can't keep it inside
I may fall sometimes
But I will survive

I'm gonna keep reachin'
I'm gonna keep climbin'
I'm gonna keep tryin'

I'm gonna keep walkin'

I'm gonna keep preachin'

Not gonna let you bring me down

Mmm, oh
I think I could like you
Already do
Feelings can grow but
They can go away too
You're taking my hand

Don't be in a rush to get me tonight
I feel something happening
Could this be a spark?
To satisfy me, baby
Got to satisfy my heart

Do you know how to touch a girl?
If you want me so much
First I have to know
Are you thoughtful and kind?
Do you care what's on my mind
Or am I just for show?

But I keep holding back
'Cause I can't seem to tell
If you're fiction or fact
Show me you can laugh
Show me you can cry
Show me who you really are
Deep down inside
Do you feel something happening?
Could this be for real?
I don't know right now
But tonight we'll reveal

Do you know how to touch a girl?

To see if we really connect
And maybe if we do, oh

JoJo,"Let it rain
Let it rain

From the first day I met ya, I noticed your style
Had that B-boy swagger, not one of the crowd
And you talked like you knew me, kept comin' around
And I fell for ya, yeah

Then as time kept going I noticed some things
That our love kept growing, wanted to run away
'Cause the situations in the past; love never really lasts
Memories just had a hold of me, oh

But I had to let go of the pain
Let love rain down on me (let it rain)
'Cause you helped me open up my eyes
Showed me things I could never see (let it rain)
'Cause we can fight, and we make up
Wanna see you when I wake up
I'll stay with you only (let it rain)
'Cause I need you to show me how our love should really be (let it rain)

I used to wonder where we're going, and where I wanted to be
Sittin' alone, all shook up when I found my destiny
Hearing songs on the radio, wishin' that could happen for me, oh oh (oh oh)
Then when you came in the picture, then I knew quickly
That we could build something so strong
Expect the best for the future, forget about what used to be
I need you here all life long

But I had to let go of the pain
Let love rain down on me
On me (let it rain)
'Cause you helped me open up my eyes
Showed me things I could never see
Never see (let it rain)
'Cause we can fight, and we make up
Wanna see you when I wake up
I'll stay with you only
Stay with you only (let it rain)
'Cause I need you to show me how our love should really be
Love should really be (let it rain)

'Cause I see the sunlight whenever we touch
All day and all night; it's never too much
Afraid of my feelings and falling too deep
But everybody's had this happen one time or another
When you need someone to set your heart free, oh oh

But I had to let go of the pain
Let love rain down on me (let it rain down, down on me, yeah)
'Cause you helped me open up my eyes
Showed me things I could never see (let it rain)
'Cause we can fight, and we make up
Wanna see you when I wake up, whoa, whoa
I'll stay with you only, oh oh
'Cause I need you to show me how our love should really be
Love should really be (let it rain)

But I had to let go of the pain
Let love rain down on me
Down on me, baby (let it rain)
'Cause you helped me open up my eyes
Showed me things I could never see (let it rain)
'Cause we can fight, and we make up
Wanna see you when I wake up
I'll stay with you only (let it rain)

Givin' you the third degree
Takin' you through it
I told you I get what I want

Then I had to take a good look
When everything else didn't have a ring to it
I'm sittin' here blamin' myself
When I saw what you were feelin' inside and misused it

This time it's all my fault
This time I can't let go
This time I did it really, but I got these feelings
How am I supposed to know?
Can't let my weakness show
Have my fits may 'cause me to miss this first chance at real love

And I don't wanna lose it
I gotta say thank you

JoJo,"I'm trying not to pretend that it won't happen again and again like that
Never thought it would end 'cause you got up in my head and my head like that
And made me happy baby love is crazy so amazing
But it's changing, rearranging
I don't think I can take anymore

'Cause the walls burned up and our love fell down
And it turned into whatever now we're saying never
Feel the fire cause it's all around and it's burning
For forever and always
We gotta let it go the other be on our way
Look for another day, 'cause it ain't the same my baby
Watch it all fall into the ground
No happy ever after, just disaster

Didn't want it this way I only wanted to say
I loved you right
Now you're walking away and leaving me here to stay
Wait for you to realize
All the things I gave you, made you change you
Your dreams came true
When I met you, now forget you
Don't want anymore

'Cause the walls burned up and our love fell down
And it turned into whatever now we're saying never
Feel the fire cause it's all around and it's burning

Look for another day, 'cause it ain't the same my baby
Watch it all fall into the ground
No happy ever after, just disaster

You shot the bullet, you shot the bullet that killed me
Not feeling my heart beat, and now we're dying
I I'm through it, I I'm through all the agony
And now my eyes are, trying, trying no more crying,
Lying it's just a game,
And I'm all right cause my love's on his way

Yeah, yeah yeah
Burning up for forever and always, always

Tension building up and I'd feel so small
Some nights I'd hide under the pillows 'cause I didn't know what else to do
Started singing just to get some attention
A melody to cut through the addiction
And every song I made turned into wishes
Some of them came true

Everyone rises, everyone falls
Everyone spends some nights alone
Rich or for poor
I'm always yours
You never left me on my own

Tell me who, who would I be without you?
No matter how much we lose
Every time I bet my life on you

Mom was on her knees cleaning houses
I used to go to work with her some days
And dream and dance in the big hallways

Everyone's scared, everyone's scarred
Everyone spends some nights alone
But every high, every low
You never left me on my own

Tell me who, who would I be without you?

Swimming in a river of my feels
Looking in the mirror, like what's the deal

You missed church on Sunday
We were still fucked up from the Saturday night
Few tequila shots later in my hotel room naked
You said we should've waited

I was young and I was up to no good, up to no good
I loved you in the only way that I could, way that I could

Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,

Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light
And that morning light is you
So I imagine my heart with you

It's not hard to conceive

You're the flame of love to me

Came over me stealing

Is laid at the feet of all our purposes

I'm wondering around on a cloud
Empty heart, I've been down and out

It's been a week I think since he wrote and it's sad
And it's been years that I've heard these stories about this
Fella he's so brave and so alive
Turning this world around from the out to the inside

Well our courtship was brief and magnetic
I was singing at the corner bar
And we both felt so romantic
We took a walk with the moon
Down to the train yard

Well it was too much for me
My gypsy heart was inflammed
Put me at the head of your list
And don't forget to call my name
Well I fell in love with a boy
Who has a real life romance with a train

Oh my beautiful lover and friend
This is exactly what I wanted
And now I'm feeling so haunted

And I can tell, you are not real

No one else seems to know

Nobody likes a spook or so I've deduced
But I have loved some ghosts in my time
But that doesn't mean I want them around
I'd rather be lost than found, I thought I would loose my mind

But through your eyes I see
Past the billboards to the trees
And the flowering weeds
Grow through the cracks of the city

And all these things will go
And all these seeds will grow
And you'll be home in the sky

When the moon sails high, a ghost ship in a dark and lonely sea
Mockingbird, your song burns right through me
I know why you singing, all the day and every night

We're lost in the shadows of a beautiful spring

",Mehitabel's Blues

I'll try to sing it pure and easily
You're like a Mexican blue
So bright and clear and pale in the afternoon

I saw you riding on your bike
In a corduroy jacket in the night
Past the hydrangeas that were blooming in the alley
With a galloping dog by your side

When I was hungry you fed me
I don't mean to suggest that I'm like Jesus Christ
Your light overwhelmed me
When I lay beside you sleepless in the night

And when you dreamed my guardian spirits appeared
And the moon stretched out across your little bed
They said they'd started to get worried about me
They were happy we had finally met, we had finally met

A mysterious bird flies away
Seemed to be calling your name
And bounced off the top of a towering pine
And vanished in the drizzling rain

There's a mockingbird behind my house
Who is a magician of the highest degree
And I swear I heard him rip the world apart
And sew it back again with his fiery melody, melody

When you were mad at me I didn't care
And I just loved you all the same
And I waited for the wind to push the hurricane
Out to sea, and the sun could shine again

Oh, I don't mean to give you advice
It's just like Delia said, ""Oh, Jesus Christ""
Just don't get so high you leave the ground
Everything is so much better when you're around

Just don't float so high you drift away
Stand tall, with your feet on the ground
I love your songs, I love your sound
Everything is so much better when you're around

When the moon is as clear as an opal
And the amethyst river sings a song
I'll remember all your dreams and the mysteries
You have borne in your crystalline soul

That you sing from your golden throat
That you shine from your sparkling eyes
That you feel from the goddess in your thighs, oh

You're like a saint's song to me
I'll try to sing it pure and easily
You're like a Mexican blue

You know the reason why
If you don't go get what you need
Something's going to break on the inside

Don't you see we're all hurt the same way
So get out, get out of your house

Jolie Holland,"Oh, listen my dear friends and I'll tell you a story
About someone I barely knew at all
He was a friend of my friends and they told me about him
How he had nothing to break his fall

He had that bad religion in his blood
The kind that brings you down and can never lift you up

He was a beautiful young man on the streets of Austin
He was a ghost faced junkie on the streets of New Orleans
I could barely recognize him when I saw him
He had to look me in the face and say my name before I knew it was him

Oh buddy, I wish I'd been a better friend

What if they only gave you love when you lied?
It's bound to really rip you up inside
Pressures a person into that horrible mouth that leaves a bloody aftermath
Everything minus one is everything

He treated me with what I considered kindness
When I crawled off to sleep in my car he was worried about me
When we payed our respects to the moon on the outskirts of Austin
I'm sorry to say I was too shy to stay in touch with him

Oh buddy, I wish I'd been a better friend

And I wonder what it takes just to save one little life
Icarus almost made it back to the shore
When I was really down, there were three little words
From a couple of good people that kept me holding on

Oh buddy, I'll never get a chance again
Oh buddy, I wish I'd been a better friend
Oh buddy, I'll never get a chance again
Oh buddy, I wish I'd been a better friend

Jolie Holland,"I live just like a fox in its hole
I live just like a fox in its hole
And they'll never know

A fox in the city burrowed under the hive
You bees can buzz around all you want
You'll never know my life

I live oh just like a fox in its hole

And sharp as the night is long
And honey holds no sway for me

Flying high like the spirits of the dead

How many candles could I light
For the living and the dead, the living and the dead?

What's that black smoke rising Jack, is the world on fire?
What's that distant singing, is it a heavenly choir?
Of the living and the dead, the living and the dead

I think about you Jack watching the TV
And drinking booze, shame on you, shame on me
But how can we help it there was no where else to go
I sent Julie and Billy out on that long hard road
On that long hard road, on that long hard road

I'm just back from Mexico city
I came back north to Texas to rest my weary head
My true love is fresh from the battle field
Sewing up the dying and carting off the dead
My baby don't stand no fighting amongst the living or the dead

Jolly Rogues,"Near Banbridge Town,
In the County Down
One morning last July,
Down a bÃ³ithrÃ­n green
Came a sweet colleen,
And she smiled as she passed me by.
She looked so neat
From her two bare feet
To the sheen of her nut-brown hair,
Such a coaxing elf,
Sure, I shook myself
To make sure I was standing there.

Chorus:
From Bantry Bay
Up to Derry Quay,
And from Galway to Dublin Town,
No maid I've seen
Like the brown colleen
That I met in the County Down.








As she onward sped,
Sure I turned my head
And I gazed with a feeling rare.
And I says, says I,
To a passer-by:
""Who's the maid with the nut-brown hair?""
He smiled at me
And he says, says he,
""That's the gem of old Ireland's crown.
Sweet Rosey McCann
From the banks of the Bann,
She's the Star of the County Down"".
Chorus:
   She'd a soft brown eye
And a look so sly,
And a smile like the rose in June,
And you hung on each note
From her lily-white throat,
As she lilted an Irish tune.
At the pattern dance
You were held in a trance,
As she tripped through a reel or a jig;
And when her eyes she'd roll,
She'd coax, on my soul,
A spud from a hungry pig.
Chorus:

I've traveled a bit,
But I never was hit
Since my roving career began;
But fair and square
I surrendered there
To the charms of young Rose McCann.
I'd a heart to let
And no tenant yet
Though I'd searched countryside and town;
But in she went,
And I asked no rent
From the Star of the county Down.
Chorus:

At the harvest fair
She'll be surely there
So I'll dress in my Sunday clothes.
With my shoes shone bright
And my hat cocked right
For a smile from my nut-brown Rose.
No horse I'll yoke,
No pipe I'll smoke
Though my plough with the rust turn brown,
Till a smiling bride
By my own fire side
Sits the Star of the County Down.
Chorus:  ",Star of the County Down

Woman: Oh, if only I could. That's what I want more than anything in the world, but it could never be...
Man: Of course it can...
Woman: But my father would find us wherever we went. Yes, he has forbidden me to... to even speak to you, if he finds me now. I don't know what he'd do...
Man: But he doesn't know that I'm... I'm a prince. Before, I was the thief of Baghdad now...

One on one to talk to you
Like film stars they get close to you
You've mirrored his appeal
He wants you so, he wants to be beside you
Then you pass by giving him the other side of you
Like the mystics do
So that every time he moves, he moves for you

Soul and light can always see
The meeting of true love and she
This silent night and I,
I guess a lonely mind might see

I've seen love on the screen
I've seen a screen goddesss and me-oh
How often this, how often, this the power of you
And so, I must confess
Whatever I see
I'm meant to be there with you
With you with you

Silent golden movies, talkies, technicolour, long ago
My younger ways stand clearer, clearer than my footprints
Stardom greats I've followed closely Closer than the nearest heartbeat
Longer that expected-ther were great-
Oh love oh love just to see them
Acting on the silver screen, oh my
Clark Gable, Fairbanks, Maureen O'Sullivan
Fantasy would fill my life and I
Love fantasy so much
Did you see in the morning light
I really talked, yes I did, to Gods early dawning light
And I was privileged to be as I am to this day
To be with you. To be with you

The wind like the wind
The stars in the sky

The sea like the sea
The moon like the moon
The stars in the sky

In the wind, on the ship, a lullaby
We sailing pass the moment of time
We sailing 'round the point
The kindly light, the kindly light

We go sailing through the waters
Of the summers end
Long ago, search for land
Looking to and fro

We searching in the day
We searching in the night
We looking everywhere
For land a helping hand

For there is hope if truth be there
How much more will we share
We pilgrims of the sea
Looking for a home

Shining so bright
Looking for light

Jon & Vangelis,"Outside of this, inside of that
The memory lingers so right
Completely as that
We've loved a long time, be my friend, I need you

Inside of this and outside of that
There's so much more to finding out
How we forever simply feel the way the wayward-winds
That hide the storms at night

Like the winter came, it changed our lives
We were very merry to be there
Our love, get used to being this way
Our love, once again a story really true creates a sound
So good, that it's true

Outside of this
Inside of that
There are words that come with time
Like love songs they seem self written
So true, they seem so true

I work a moments time
And feel this is one of life's mysteries
Bringing a smile
'Cause I know what it does to you
So I'm trying to pass it through
Trying for you

Countless variations of the memory, the state
The mere emotion of getting 'round
Crazy understandings of the way we tilt the light
But it shines when we make the sound

Don't live by mistakes
We can dance to your tune
But there's this whole understanding
And it's coming I guess, I know
I hope that you can get into this
To this

I got it just the other day
You seem so happy
So funny how time melts away
It's such a pleasure to see you growing
And how you're sending your love
Through the air today

I think of heaven
Each time I see you walking there
And as you're walking
I think of children everywhere

It's in your star sign
You're growing stronger
I can't believe you
It's so good to care

Through enchantment, into sunlight
Angels touched your eyes
Your highness, electric, so surprised

Is this your first life?
It seems as though you have lived before
You help me hold on
You have a heart like an open door
You sing so sweetly
My love adores you
She does, she's thinking of you right now 
I know

The summer's coming
I'll keep in touch so you're not alone
Then like a Swallow, you'll fly away
Like birds have flown
So let me tell you
How much I love you
I'd make the songbirds sing
For you again

Jon & Vangelis,"In amongst the rings of confusion
Silencing the thought powers one by one
It seems all so incredible
Our own ability to confuse, to sacrifice
To enlighten like a Shakespearian play
We foolish and happily hold on to sanity
While all around the pushing
And prodding of our feelings
The twisting and turning of our hearts
Displaying an almost indefinable strength
Of purpose, a reason, a reason, a reason
Where no reasons seems to exist

Yet, as in a vision, a voice transcending
All our imagination, jewel of life
Guiding light heralding a joyous new dawn
Clear and gifted time
Divine nature, super nature
The supreme gift of knowledge and space
In this cacophony of life

It lifts you to true emotion

Jon & Vangelis,"If you just take my sense of freedom
If you just take away my home
You can't ever hope to win me
This I'll tell you for sure
There is strength in the common people
For the people is all we really are
Young and old, the wisest and the lowly
Each indeed is 'Holy' in the 'Light of Love'
When the 'Word' comes
I will be waiting
Like a dove that shines he prays for peace
Some have waited what seems a lifetime
Some are waiting now to be released
For the moment we have this freedom
We will choose the way our hearts will move
All the people lost will find their way
Give that chance today
Hear and I will pray
No not for nothing hearts will not be broken
As long as we are open
Our hearts will make us free
Free for the Earth man
Free for the millions
In the 'Glory' all will come to 'Truth'
No aggression, that we leave behind us
To be replaced
By 'You'

For tomorrow another day
In our children there's that sense of freedom
Help them use it wisely

And travel through the woodlands together
In the light of heaven
And the silence of the world.
Keeping in touch with the sun
Keeping it for everyone
Latter day dreams that come your way
Will gather in the light
Everything about today just mellows
In the ligght: in your eyes.
I think about silent list
Drowned this summer, travel light
All the deeds and the candlelight
But there is no explaining it
Let the weary come around-one more time-
One more time
Let the weary come one more time around.
I should have guessed that things
Were getting out of hand, the other day
When you told me that you'd gone and left
Your father's ways behind
and you thought that you, couldn't understand him
Well, he didn't really answer the dreams
That you'd planned
So you chased around, all those times,
That come between you, yourself and yourself,
One more time, one more time, one more time
Did you have to think about it, one more time
Put yourself under pressure one more time,
One more time.
Things are looking better now
I heard you say the other day that you knew
So many times I've tried to understand,
We go through
Then again it's the morning light
That can catch my heart aflame
Just the thought of your sweet face
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over and over and over and over again.",One More Time

Down the lane and over the railway line

We were looking for a hide away
Getting lost and losing track of time

We went down by the river
We went down by the river
Where the water ran slow
Was where we let our loving run free
We went down by the river
We went down by the river
Just laying low
My true love and me

You let your long brown hair hang down
Your summer dress was swaying in the breeze
When we were skimming stones across the stream
You had a lazy style and a carefree smile
You were a breathless beauty to behold
The sweetest sight my eyes had ever seen

We went down by the river
We went down by the river
Where the water ran slow
Was where we let our loving run free
We went down by the river
We went down by the river
Just laying low
My true love and me

Well waters rise and streams divide
And that river keeps rolling on
Paper boats and pleasure drift away
And you may be just a memory
But you're shinning like a distant star
It seems to me as clear as yesterday

We went down by the river

First light streams through the treetops
Bouncing as the flowers illuminate
The breath of morning

This song of ages past
I lay in peace midst grass so green
To reach to skyward
Where larks do sing such high delights
Do pour into my senses
The days are blessings
The days are blessings
The days are blessings",Days
Jon Anderson,"First the planet, a star
Suspended in the realm of infinity
Soul and light charged together
In form called life adorned
To which the world offered a home
Once made for love
And love alone
For you, for me
For you, for me

It did not stop there, we are form
The magic body, that soft machine
Acclimatised with vision
And just enough thought to begin the test
To learn and just in front
The source of indifference
To the song of knowledge ever sung
For you, for me
For you, for me

The climate in itself creates a sound so volatile
It makes these words seem clueless forever more
But if in honesty it takes just one dream
To evaluate the chance of choice
Dispelling the clear light
Invincible
Impregnable
For you, for me
For you, for me
Hear it

Down through the age of time
The moment is not and never shall be time
We each revolve around the magnitude
Of time and motion
The point of all is of course not for our earthly talk
For we stand, we walkk, we kick, we provoke
We council, we destroy, we look, we employ
We say, here we are and why
No ther life form asks why
Hear me
Hear me

Oh yes! you critics of life and love
You stallions of the pen and more
While you spew your dry thoughts
On poets of nature, hang them low
Scoff with glee the unfortunate mass
You say stil lclings to the treasures of the past
And music
For you, for me
For you, for me
You hear it now
You hear it now
I hear you now",For You for Me

Jon Anderson,"When I was young I had thoughts of a kind that still linger
Entwined with realities reasoning
I'd sit on the hill side and look out far yonder, imagine I'd easily
Fly away, to where? I don't know
But the imagery caught by my quick imagination would lift me
My spirit to conquer a fall
Well now let me tell you the simplest of stories
We've all been through this moment
And really we've all been through this birth

All praise this glorious chance of life
All praise this wonderous feeling too
All praise this time we all go through
This pain, this light, we bare so fast
Rebirth at last

And I wanted to be by my wife
As she'd labored and given
The child a life, she the purest soul
So I wanted to be by her side
For the very first time I said
For the full and simple reason
Well I wanted it, well yes I did

As a mother and father of innocence
Gladly helping a child to this world
There was more than relief on our minds
It was like touching moments in history
Not just for a memory
With the help of those dear people
Who could have thought for a better
Reason of just wanting to be there
Who could have thought for a better
Reason of just wanting to be there
Who could have thought for a better
Reason of just wanting to be there
For the full and simple reason
Well I wanted it
Wanted it
Wanted to be there

Out in a whispering of time
Can a mother and child love right away
Mother and father as their right accept a reason
As the child's eyes that dream on and dream a life away
So the moment I thought about release of life that comes on
And how hopefully wise we become with each passing day
I wondered at this",Animation

It was a mid-summer night dream long ago
I kinda got me a mood
About me, hit me,
Something was trying to tell me something

I know it sounds pretty crazy really
When you think about it, but I,
Heard voices calling me saying
Have you heard the good news personified

You realize what we're talking about
About the power of love
Why don't the United Nations
Declare a special night celebration

We're gonna send the weapons up on a starry night
Explode them above the atmosphere, it sounds right
The whole damn world will be watching
The magic mushrooms in the bright sky
Such a night of splendor
What a way to surrender

What a way to surrender
See me off down to grab the colonels and the generals
To write a letter to the heads of the government, government
Asking them to name, the day
If you think anything of anyone
Why don't sit right down and write that letter
Getting rid of that fear the sooner the better
How about this for a mid-summer night dream
A night we all will remember
All will remember

We're gonna send the weapons up on a starry night
Explode them above the atmosphere,

Who wandered on my own
Looking for some familiar road

I was a diamond man at night
I was a fool that couldn't believe at all

Until you're strong enough to love

With no foundation in my heart

And it wasn't until I saw

'Cause there's no way
I could ever find a love so right
Not in any other lifetime

So it's love more or less
A special thing, to be true

How you gonna feel it when you cannot live it
How you gonna kiss the one you need?
How you gonna reach for the dreams that you think about
How you gonna let it be?

Oh! but I know this is right
We kiss in a special way
I think about it every night
Think about you every day

Caught in the moon
Singing with the changes
Dancing then making us sigh

Asking us to wonder
Asking us to listen
Where are we now?

Can you believe the passion
Can you believe the healing

Part understanding

How we dance upon the ground we bring together
Can you hear the echo sound, showing us a wisdom found
Was there ever so much trust in our foundation

'cause' I believe the world, the earth is fine alright
And we keep believing we shall live forever
And I've truly learned the lessons, soul eternal love
We all need to stand to trust in the light

See it as a song of youth, telling us to understand
Never before has a child had so much pressure
Helping in so many ways, ready to begin this age
Children of the 21st century come now

For they shall be the spirit, they shall be the truth
Where the colors and the creeds all come together
They will magnify our deeds and show us all the way
Better to be sacred than sorry

See it in the songs of youth, worshipping the soul of love
How we danced upon the ground we bring together
You know you can imagine this, you know you can imagine that
All we are is you and I and the stars above
All we are is you and I and the stars above
All we are is you and I and the stars above
And the spirit of love

Jon Anderson,"T'was the dawn creation of the underworld
Caves were born with thunder rendered sheets
Of flame cascading light the morning light
The dawning of the underworld.

All regions of Earth and space did take their place
Features carved with colors raining all about
Then brightness of the morning sun
Oh, glory of the morning sun.

Tell me of the way of things and how such beauty
Can divide our hearts and hands while holding
Out so closely now.
King of kings will oversee the dawning of truth

The overworld, pain is borne as love surrenders
Higher ever higher ever true to you.
Surely tell me secrets of the morning mist
Rain will fall and wash us evermore beside the

Everflowing ease.

Jon Anderson,"After the first embrace from you my senses knew
The look of love was in your eyes
And after we first make love our senses tingle to
The touch oh how we hypnotize

Oh, to get the feeling on and on
Oh, just to get the feeling

Holding you closer in my arms we drift to heaven
Bringing in the morning light
And after all is said and done there's only us
We can make it right
So, our love will carry on and on
Now our love will be free, be free.

And when we play, love don't delay, I hear you now
For what was then, is what is now, anyhow
As I became a guest of love's tune hear again
We'll carry on together like today.

Jon Anderson,"I heard you on the radio
Some other time
From some forgotten studio
Way down the line
So long, so long I've waited now
To hear you again
That song, that song will still remain
It's become an old friend
And now, the tears are in my eyes
The sound you can't disguise
The truth comes back from lies
And all I want to hear

Voice of America, ooh, America
Voice of America, ooh, America

And then you came in stereo
Calling to me
And so I watch the videos
Across the T.V.
That sound, still ringing in my ears
From a decade ago
Around, around my head, the sound from my radio
I thought, that after all these years
The tears, the growing fears
That I would never hear
Never again

Jon Anderson,"A man conceived a moment's answers to the dream,
Staying the flowers daily, sensing all the themes.
As a foundation left to create the spiral aim,
A movement regained and regarded both the same,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.

Changed only for a sight of sound, the space agreed.
Between the picture of time behind the face of need,
Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.
Oh.

Turn round tailor, Coins and
Assaulting all the mornings of the Crosses
Interest shown, Never know
Presenting one another to the cord, Their fruitless worth;

All left dying, rediscovered Cords are broken,
Of the door that turned round, Locked inside
To close the cover, the mother earth.

Well you can talk that way, but i have to say,

And the days were long and slow
But were we wiser then?
I couldn't say, I wouldn't know
But i wasn't worried at all
i had someone to run to
And i wasn't worried at all
I knew which way the wind blew

Counting out the chaos in bloom
Carry me home
And I watched the sinners spin round the room

how will it be
Can you tell me how will it be now

How will it be?

How will it be?

How will it be?

Keep speeding up

I head you say ""go for what you knnow""

Curiosity causing me pain
And the only thing to do
Is to get to know you better
With you timid little easy sway

And I didn't know what to say
Honey baby you just stood there
Just kicking with that stare
And I stood fighting with my instincts
But the fight is not fair

Please rewind it, make this moment be true

I've been counting on the one that I love
It's not that love breaks your heart

Not to let my love overflow
Noo, I didn't know

For all those who choose to climb
Sometimes it feels like no matter how far I get
The distance is all up to time
See I gave my love my only faith
But oh what a shame
I felt wealthy with my bag of fools' gold
And there's a point when you know
That love's off the tracks
When the train stops 'cause the engine's too cold

Don't want to say I lost my faith in love

[Chorus:]
Hey pretty girl
Can I be your man tonight, baby?
Hey pretty mama
Can I sleep with you tonight?

Hey, pretty girl when you come to my room tonight
I'll make you calm through the night
Your legs around my waist so tight
I'll slide down south to taste you right
You taste so good to me
How does a man like me
Seduce a girl like you
How can I make you my one and only 
How can I make you scream
There's no one else for you
'And nobody does it like me, baby

[Chorus]

There's a candle that's burning in my heart tonight
And the flame is full of my desire
And I can't help but desire you in my bed tonight
And I'll touch you in the places
Where no one's been before
And I'll kiss you in the places
Where men sometimes ignore
And I'll take you to a level
You've never felt before
And though you won't understand it
You'll cry and ask for more

Jon B.,"I learned so much about love
Since I've been by your side
And you spend all your time
Knowing what you've done for me
The simple fact is
That I'm longing for you, girl
Desperate and needing you to stay in my life

'Cause I'm sorry but forgiving
But your love for me id for the wrong reasons
I wish I could satisfy you baby
But you're so sick of the those natural things
Guess I'm a fool for loving you
But honestly the truth is

Chorus
Time after time
I'll be yearning for you
Dime after dime
I thought I was earnin' 4 two
Maybe this time you1ll be the one
Who feels the pain
Time after time again

I used to be such a baby
Crying in your arms
But now I'm older, wiser
Now I'm hip to the scene
Tell me, when you make love to that someone else
Do you think of how it felt
Different with me when you feel asleep?
When you wake up, I was there

I was honest
I was changed for the good
But the bad of it all
Is it's worth nothing, nothing to you
I wonder if after it all
Is there someone still waiting for me
Is this all in the plan for the helping hand
I wish it would be you
But I know it can1t
(Chorus)

You gave your reasons why
You made perfect sense
But you'll miss your water
When your well runs dry
'Cause somewhere, I believe
I was the one
You'll have your fun
In the back of your mind
You'll find that you still love me
Time after time
(Chorus)",Time After Time
Jon B.,"Chorus:
Girl itÂ¡Â¯s alright, baby
'Cause itÂ¡Â¯s there in your eyes yeah
I can see that you want me
By the way that you smile
Are you still down for me
 
Left once again at home
Another night on your own
Ain't no fun in lovin if youÂ¡Â¯re lovin alone 
How does it feel to be useless, oh no
Can you recall how close we used to be then
Can you still remember those feelings again
Seems like everytime I see you
ThereÂ¡Â¯s a tear in your eye
Time to make some decisions
Or go dying inside

Watch the sky
I makes you smile
But you'd rather have what makes you cry
Say goodbye and leave now
With my heart on my sleeve 
Memories now what I found is you
Still care you had feelings
And theyÂ¡Â¯re still there baby
Girl keep it real here
Are you still down?

Remember that evening
I knew that you were too scared
To go all the way
But you did it to please me
You were crying it was raining
When you gave it to me
The more I see you
The more that I feel inside
And I know one day 
YouÂ¡Â¯ll make it back to where you can fly
Watch time go, donÂ¡Â¯t cry 
Tomorrow brings better days
Let me dry your eyes
And take your burden away

Only once in a lifetime
Touch my soul go slow
Baby boo donÂ¡Â¯t rush the flow
Got me all weak baby
But IÂ¡Â¯m strong in parts
More bounce to the ounce
With the longest sparks
Gettin' mine like fine wine
Measured in time
Many other brothers loved you 
But the pleasure was mine
Mama taught me how 
To love a woman properly sprung
We committed so I hit it
So itÂ¡Â¯s properly done
Are you still down?

Trying too hard to get you on their team 
Thats when you tell that you came with me babe

I know what you like babe 
I know how to make you ooh 
Babe don't have to cry ever again
You keep me satisfied babe 
No pigeons on my mind babe
Nobody can love me like you do baby yeah

[Chorus:]

All I want is you
Baby all I want is you
Mami you got me now right next to you
Mami all I want is you

Ey, you know you wifey to me

And I know that you really like it too

Babe don't have to cry ever again
You keep me satisfied babe 
No pigeons on my mind babe
I'm straight real wit the way that I feel

Yo mami all I want is you 
Don;t know what to do when I'm love with you
Got me going crazy baby boo thats the honest truth
Promise the menogame only if you ride with me
The sky's the limit if you with it
You can come and fly with me
As long as you don't lie to me and show me true love
Represent and stay beside of me 
Just like my crew does
Keep the shit we do in privacy between the 2 of us
You can right it in your diary 
Don't keep it a grudge 
Now is that asking for too much 
Cause you packing that good stuff
This attractions more than lust 
You feel my pressure when we crush and plus
You got the sweetest touch 
Got a Man I'll beat him up
I need your love got a high head
I don't believe in luck
See me up in a stretch limo next to my people
Jon B mami please listen to my demo hello
I keep it ghetto like this hour on my peddle
If you like flowers then 
Follow my trail of rose petals

Dancing feels so good tonight
When your dancing looking so fine
Ooh baby shake that stuff like you do
Move that healthy body and I'm a come dance wit u

Sweetheart
What's up with your boy?
Come on

Your so-called man's got you stressin' out on a regular
Seems all you do is just fight about nothin' baby
Out with his friends he comes home late night
(He's got more important things to do)
You see the signs makin' love
He don't take his time
All in a daze someone else must be on his mind
Plans for engagement change to another day
(There slipping far away)

All that you need is a little bit of tenderness
Stability in your life
Pull a star out of the sky and place it on your hand
(Star out the sky and I place it on your hand)

He don't understand cause
Boy is not a man
Still messin' around
Don't know what he really wants
(He don't know if he really wants your love babe)

He don't run your baths
And no he never had your back
Stop messin' around
Cause the boy is not man
(He is not a man)

I can't sit by and watch a man just mistreat a dime
He's got a jewel in his pocket that he can't find
Feel like your loyalty is wasted girl
Why do you chase it girl
(You might as well face it girl)
Is it worth it girl I know it's gettin' old to you
He's givin' dough to you
But he's so cold to you

I'm a stop second guessing myself
And step up straight to you
Want to relate to you and I got the taste for you

All that you need is a little bit of tenderness
Stability in your life
Pull a star out of the sky and I place it on your hand
(On your hand)

He don't understand cause
Boy is not a man
Still messin' around
Don't know what he really wants
(He don't know if he really wants but I know I do girl)

He don't run your baths
And no he never had your back
Stop messin' around
Cause the boy is not man

He don't understand your problems
So how's ever gonna solve them
Baby you know I want your love

When he's sexin' you does your spin get chills girl
New positions everytime, I will girl
You need a change of plans
The boy is not a man

He don't understand cause

He don't run your baths
And no he never had your back
Stop messin' around

Does he ever try to solve them

Jon B.,"I looked in the mirror today
Took a good look at my face
And all I guess that I can say
Is I'm just a man trying to find his way

It's been a long and windy road
But at least I got you to hold
And I've become the man I am
'Cause all our troubles made me understand
It's been all of our lives

All of our lives I want to stay this way
Our Lord knows we're gonna make mistakes
But I'll give up everything to make it through
And all our lives ain't been the easiest time
And Lord knows it's been an up hill climb
But I'll do it all again to be with you

Ever since we went through with the plan
I'm feeling like I've become a better man
'Cause I'm giving up that part of me
That held me back from being free

And now when we kiss I feel your soul
I'm putting back the pieces others stole
And now nobody can hurt
My baby cause we make it work

I can't hold the rain back when it starts to storms
(Just let it rain)
You don't have to fight your feelings anymore
(We can learn from the pain)
When I'm all alone I count the reasons why
Just till you think girl, you'll be alright
You just take your time
All of your live

All of our lives I want to stay this way
Our Lord knows we're gonna make mistakes
But I'll give up everything to make it through

And you don't have to be alone

It was hard enough, growing up
Being as beautiful as you
Trying to save your love for the one that's true
It's not always so easy to know what's right to do

It's your first mistake, you can't make
Make someone be down with you
Why do you even take the time out to call that fool
When you know deep in your heart that he don't care 'bout you

Oh you can dry your eyes
Pick yourself up and say bye bye

There's a tear in your eye
Time to make some decisions
Or go dying inside

Tell 'em all call me a fool
But I'm stuck in this love thing
Plus I'm over heatin' from the rush
Our tongues touch
Kissin' fellin' fireworks
Watch the sky
I makes you smile
But you'd rather have what makes you cry
Say goodbye and leave now
With my heart on my sleeve
Memories now what I found is you
Still care you had feelings
And they're still there baby
Girl keep it real here
Are you still down?

Girl it's alright, baby
'Cause it's there in your eyes yeah
I can see that you want me
By the way that you smile
Are you still down for me

Remember that evening
I knew that you were too scared
To go all the way
But you did it to please me
You were crying it was raining
When u gave it to me
The more I see you
The more that I feel inside
And I know one day
You'll make it back to where you can fly
Watch time go, don't cry
Tomorrow brings better days
Let me dry your eyes
And take your burden away

Only once in a lifetime
Touch my soul go slow
Baby boo don't rush the flow
Got me all weak baby
But I'm strong in parts
More bounce to the ounce
With the longest sparks
Gettin' mine like fine wine
Measured in time
Many other brothers loved you
But the pleasure was mine
Mama taught me how
To love a woman properly sprung
We committed so I hit it
So it's properly done
Are u still down?

Girl it's alright, baby
'Cause it's there in your eyes yeah
I can see that you want me
By the way that you smile
Are you still down for me

Girl it's alright, baby
'Cause it's there in your eyes yeah
I can see that you want me
By the way that you smile
Are you still down for me

Jon B.,"Somebody told me that you were here
With your girls but by yourself

When we need to be loosing it, cut up a bit
You know I'm wit all that you're bring girl.

You do it every time, blow my mind

Part 2
This is for all the homeboys who couldn't get their happy home
As long as one of us got it some of us got it
Stay down for me, hold on

Verse 1:
Sometimes you made me feel like I wasn't good enough for you
So I punished us both and didn't stay true
So much pain I know I've caused you
Truly I'm sorry every day that I'm away girl
Things went down that just don't make sense
Time and place is all now irrevelant
Cause I'm still thinking about the love that's gone
Morning, cooking breakfast back at home

Chorus:
I never meant for this to end
But we couldn't just let it go again
We broke up, it's been years and we can't turn back
But I still remember my happy home, home, home

2Pac:
Goin' through hard times, ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you have to suffer for your father's crimes
To be honest, it's a hard role just to keep up your faith in God
Knowing you'll get scared though
Look at him walking and talking, a little child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over little seeds, help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle
Married my baby's momma, made her my wife now
I'm tryin' hard y'all, maybe in time I'll be a better man
Watching older couples, handle it like veterans
Show me the meaning of forever and together we rise
If it'll help our child grow then together we die
Why question my love, it's so easy to see
Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments and the nights alone
Now it's time to live the good life

[Chorus]

Verse 2:
I wonder what you must feel like now you know
That I'm having a seed with someone else
I didn't plan it to be this way
But things happen with time
And you know, time don't wait for nobody baby Oh, now I gotta handle my responsibility
Even though you still mean so much to me
Baby I can't say enough that I'm sorry
Oh, I never meant

[Chorus]

Jon B.,"Oh, yeah,

Trying to get through this flesh
Making its way to my heart
Wanting to destroy what's left.

At night getting caught up in what you might find
Baby I got love for you but I'ma have 
To fall back even though you usually spend the night

What in the world 
What in the world are we doing?
Spending so much time?
What is it girl
What in the world are we doing?
I guess all I know is that
It's a beautiful thing but
What in the world are we doing?

Sometimes you got me feeling like I got a personal angel
But I've learned from the past to keep my expectations low
'Cause don't you know what it feels like when you put
All your faith in someone and they bounce
Then you know what you know about love

Baby we need to take precautions (Baby we need to take precautions)

So fast emotions the time it takes to get to where
We are such a short time it seems but what a

The way you moving ooh that's crazy
So amazing I'm getting faded

So amazing I'm getting faded
Off you so intoxicating

Pretty feet with open toes
Scent of your neck is like a fresh red rose
X-ray vision passing through your clothes
But I really cant wait to see you naked though
The way your body move and you dip it slow
I try to play it cool but I gotta let you know
The way you looking I can tell you wanna go
Skip the preview and lets get to the show

My baby she kick it, she cool with all the fellas, she hood
Like taking chances but classy like Cinderella
She down like four flats, my baby girl is real, 
She done weathered the storm and baby down with you still

Now we at home and were all alone
With no interruptions just turn off you phone
Daddy's little girl but now that your all grown
Birthday suit is all you got on
Got the radio on and its playing your song
Touching on your body all night long
Feels so right that it cant be wrong
Sexual healing coming on strong

Them curves like a coke bottle cant be beat
Pedicure every week on them cute little feet
She a freak under the covers but she keep it discrete
She's my midnight treat baby for real that's why I remain

[Chorus]

She shaped like an hour glass
Flier than a mockingbird
Baby got that smooth skin softer than some fox fur
We go together like sweaters in cold weather
Nobody can do it better baby down for whatever
She gangsta like lil' Kim sexy like Alicia Keys
Funny like smoore baby cooler than a summer breeze
Man I swear my baby cuter than a teddy bear, nobody compares
Lil' mama baby that's why I am your man

Jon Ballantyne,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

I've been seeing lately

She just holds on to something that she knows is long gone

Who lusts, gives, tries
Sometimes I lose my way

Angry at all the things, angry at all the things I can't change
When you're lost in the universe, lost in the universe

Took 'em with him when the deal came
Selling out in every state
Signed a deal after his first tape

Push me down the Hudson and turn on the radio
Long Island's only smiling 'cause my soul is flying
I did everything for New York

New Yorker in California, packed Brooklyn up in this bag
I'm in Malibu with the Bronx, she's in Kevin love with your man
Kyrie needed a king, I'm just making you understand
What I rustle up in the West, 'cause my reach is Kevin Durant
Records are very pop with a pocket deeper than sand
A juxtaposition, Sam Cooke, Billy Joel, Steely Dan
Changing the fucking spectrum, I need you to understand
Like I took the fall for some drugs, I've been nominated for Grams (It's Grammy's)
Skinny genius got blueprints up in my hand
So the minute you hear my single, just know that it's in my plan
Advantage of demographics, I'm Jigga, Bruno and Sam Smith
I'm moving business, I'm Taylor Swift in a van
This game, boy, is very, very advanced
I'm very, very New York, be very, very aware
How very, very De Niro I can get on a snare
Letting go of your throat, I can sing the hook if you scared

Bring me down in Brooklyn if I lose my life
Push me down the Hudson and turn on the radio
Long Island's only smiling 'cause my soul is flying
I did everything for New York

Meet me in the red dress when the stakes side, that's porterhouse
She's 5 foot 9 in a Rolls Royce, that's Slaughterhouse
Benny Hahn, Hahn's and a tall boy, we ordered out
The hell you need a chaser when all this liquor is watered down
Wait, see all them lines is fuck boy chat
Don't be so impressed by all that fuck boy rap
This money gon' leave you empty if you just want that
See, my joy lies in the son and you should jump on that
She'll make you think that she the wife and that you found the one
But she just looking for some powder, not the talcum one
Iâm not judging, here in the middle like Iâm Malcolm, son
Verbal trigger like you should never play around with guns
Bow down to no crown, these goobers out for the count
'Cause the Sour Diesel was loud, I was pounding face in the lounge
Sober dope, moving proud, like allowance found in the crowd
With a thousand counting me out, but I'm here and killing the crowd now, blow

Bring me down in Brooklyn if I lose my life
Push me down the Hudson and turn on the radio

I did everything for New York

Yo, I'm telling you
Yo, I'm telling you
Yo, I'm telling you
Yo, I'm telling you

Let me give the kids just a little help
Tell 'em money is not the key to wealth
'Cause if it can stop the pain
How the fuck did you explain the bunch of millionaires that killed themselves?
So you can take me off your winner's shelf
I got different vision, I'm bringing help
I know the demons in the room gon' say it's more that I can chew
But now all I hear is the dinner bell
I need a family that loves me right
Don't need a chain, don't need a club at night
I had a conversation with an angel
She told me I'd cheat death if I stayed away from the party life
Dropped off in the land where the artists play
Where God's way is the hardest way
Told myself I'm keeping my faith
If it costs me my reputation, then take it, I'll give it all away","New York Soul, Pt. 2"

She don't want a problem if there's not one
But people come around and try some stupid shit to start one
She give you the people's fuckin' elbow like The Rock, son

There is an ocean in your hips, so deep, I'd dive

Get the bailiff out 'cause Mr. Bellion's out the cell
We skip the bail and out the jail
We hit the trail, the route we took is hard to smell it out
So get to sniffin', equipped with the gift of spit like the lisp on the chick who played in the flick next to Spiderman
I'm brighter than LEDs on your TV
Keyz is sharp as a dagger
Who walks around with a swagger of Kenny G
When you see me, chill with the chatter
Got the skill of a master craftsman whose passion is rappin'
Snackin' on actors, so pass me a napkin
Chip on the shoulder, the kid is colder than both Dakotas
The winter soldier, assassin coming after your captain
For honor and every day, I'm getting stronger

When they apply the pressure, it's heavier than E. Honda

Wonder what would of have happened if you were the killer and I was the hero
Would things be the same ?
Or would I have traded your life for my own life ?
Would I have paid your debts in your place ?

When you're livin' on the run
Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young

For the things that I have done
Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young
The desert's been a friend to me
It covers me by night
And a snakebite's not my enemy
But it taught me how to fight
All this fame don't bring you freedom
Though it wears a this disguise
When an outlaw is just a man to me
And a man has to die

I'm just looking for tomorrow
And I ain't gonna hurt no one

I jumped headfirst into a bottle
I was lookin' for a friend
Came up just short of nothin'
I didn't find the truth, I only found an end

So tell me who's gonna save me
Or my father or my son?
When the only justice a man can see
Is the barrel of a loaded gun, oh yeah

I been broke and I've been hungry
I think they're both my middle name
But I don't never ever never seem to get enough
Still I guess, I can't complain

'Cause what you get in life you take it
You've gotta hold on and make it last
They say good things come to those who wait
But it's life that goes so fast

And when there's just one rule you live by
Each day you kiss the risin' sun
When you live and die by the life we breathe
In the barrel of a loaded gun

Guns talk to me in my sleep at night
And a gun somewhere is burnin'
With my name

Winners are losers
And losers will have to face
All those yesterdays
And all of the dreams they blew away

So Mister can you help me
Or are you my gun?
Have the ghosts of justice
Brought you here to me to taste

That a man walks
When a bird can fly
We have to kick the ground
The stars kiss the sky
They say that spirits live
A man has to die
They promised us truth
Now they're giving us lies

Gonna take a miracle top save us this time (ooh...)
And your savior has just left town
Gonna need a miracle 'cause it's all on the line
And I won't let you down
(No I won't let you down, ooh...)
The river of your hope is flooding
And I know the dam is busted
If you need me I'll come running
I won't let you down... no, no

You're looking for salvation
You thought that it'd be shining like an angel's light, yeah
Well, the angels left this nation
And salvation caught the last train out tonight
He lost a hell of a fight

He said: ""I'm just one man, that's all I'll ever be
I never can be everything you wanted from me
I've got big plans so big that any blind man could see
I'm standing in the river
Now I'm drowning in the sea""

Gonna take a miracle top save us this time (ooh...)
And your savior has just left town
Gonna need a miracle 'cause your heart's on the line
And your heartbeat is slowing down (heartbeat's blowing, ooh...)
Your feet are grounded still you're reaching for the sky
You can let 'em clip your wings 'cause I believe that you can fly

Well my eyes have seen the horror of the coming of the flood
I've driven deep the thorny crown into the soul of someone's son
Still I'll look you in the eye 'cause I've believed in things I've thought
And I'll die without regret for the wars I have fought

Gonna take a miracle top save you this time (ooh...)
And your savior has just left town
Gonna need a miracle 'cause your heart's doing time
And your conscience is calling you out (conscience's calling, ooh...)
It ain't all for nothing
Life ain't written in the sand
I know the tide is coming
But it's time we made a stand with a miracle

Gonna take a miracle, I need a miracle
I need a miracle, I need a miracle
Na, miracle (miracle) oh...",Miracle
Jon Bon Jovi,"As we stood there older than men
And younger than the boys (that's right)
We were as still as the wind
That blows on a hot august night

And you were lonesome
As a jukebox
But deadly just the same
I could be as gentle as a newborn
Then spit into the eye of a hurricane

And we knew how to laugh
And we knew how to cry
Yeah, we sure knew how to live
But we don't ever

Never say die
Never say die

I guess you'd say we had a pact
These words we knew so well (that's right)
Still they remained unspoken
And we'd take them to the fiery
Gates of hell

Once i was afraid of love
But when it's your brother
Those things change
'cause love is just another word
For trust
So hear me when i say

Never say die
Never say no
You got to look them in the eye
And don't let go
When it's your own blood you'll bleed
And your own tears you'll cry
When you're brought up to believe
That it's the strong who survive
Never say die

Solo
Yeah, and we could run like lightning
Through the pouring rain
And we'll be standing like a soldier
Who comes marching home again

They ask what it is that i want written
On the gravestone where I'll lie
Tell them it's just my bones
That died there
So save the tears they'll cry

My spirit is still riding somewhere
Somewhere in this night
When it's these three words that come to me
As i kiss this world goodbye

Never say die
Never say no
You got to look them in the eye
And don't let go
When it's your own blood you'll bleed
And your own tears you'll cry
When you're brought up to believe
That it's the strong who survive
Never say die",Never Say Die
Jon Bon Jovi,"They say that no man is an island
And good things come to those who wait
But the things I hear are there
Just to remind me 
Every dog will have his day
The spirits they intoxicate me
I watched them infiltrate my soul
They try to say it's too late for me
Tell my guns I'm coming home

[Chorus:]
I swear I'm gonna live forever
Tell my maker he can wait
I'm riding somewhere south of heaven
Heading back to Santa Fe
It's judgment day in Santa Fe
Once I was promised absolution
There's only one solution for my sins
You gotta face your ghosts and know
With no illusions
That only one of you is going home again
And I blame this world for making 
A good man evil
It's this world that can drive a 
Good man mad
And it's this world that turns a killer 
Into a hero
Well I blame this world for making
A good man bad

[Chorus:]

Now I ain't getting into heaven
If the devil has his way
I swear I'm gonna live forever
Heading back to Santa Fe
Got debts to pay in Santa Fe
It's judgment day in Santa Fe

[Solo]
So I save a prayer
For when I need it most
To the Father, Son
And the Holy Ghost
And sign it from a sinner
With no name
When I meet my maker
When I close the book
On the hearts I broke
And the lives I took
Will he walk away
'Cause my soul's
Too late to save

[Chorus:]

Now I ain't getting into heaven
If the devil has his way
I swear I'm gonna live forever
Heading back to Santa Fe
Got debts to pay in Santa Fe
It's judgment day in Santa Fe",Santa Fe
Jon Bon Jovi,"You're dancing with your shadow
You been talking in your sleep
Well you can walk on water
But don't want to wet your feet

You really got me 
You really got me now
You know I don't know how you do it
But you really put me through it
You got me
You say you talk to everyone
Who is anyone in town
But they don't recognize you
With your foot out of your mouth

Who am I to judge a man
Who says he's his own biggest fan

You brought a knife out to a gunfight
And you're shouting that I'm dead

Think you're in over your head

Jon Bon Jovi,"It was another day 
A perfect Texas afternoon 
A mother and two children play 
The way they always do 
As they raced home from the mailbox 
A mother and her son 
Against a little girl of 6 years old 
The independent one 

The deputies went door to door 
Through all the neighborhood 
They said I got some news to tell you folks 
I'm afraid it ain't so good 
Somehow something happened 
Someone got away 
Someone got the answers for what happened here today 
Oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no, no 

Tell me it was just a dream, August 7 4:15 
God closed His eyes and the world got mean 
August 7 4:15 

Now the people from the papers and the local T.V. news 
Tried to find the reason 
Cop dogs sniffed around for clues 
Someone shouted ""Hit and Run"" 
The coroner cried ""Foul"" 
Her blue dress was what she wore 
The day they laid her body down 
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no, no, no, no 

Tell me it was just a dream, August 7 4:15 
God closed His eyes and the world got mean 
August 7 4:15 

I know tonight that there's an angel 
Up on Heaven's highest hill 
And no one there can hurt you baby 
No one ever will 
Somewhere someone's conscience is like a burning bed 
The flames are all around you 
How you gonna sleep again 

Oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no, no 

Tell me it was just a dream, August 7 4:15 
God closed His eyes and the world got mean

Jon Bon Jovi,"I've been staring at the page for what seems like days 
I guess I put this one off for a while 
Did I see a tear fall from your eyes? 
Or did you laugh so hard that you cried? 
When I served my secrets on a silver tray to you (hey now) 
Hey now, I guess the night's just bringing me down 

There's no love, there's no hate 
I left them there for you to take 
But know that every word was a piece of my heart (hey now) 

You've been the blood in my veins 
The only one who knows my middle name 
And the smiles, they came easy 'cause of you (hey now) 
You know that I love you, but I hate you 
'Cause I know I can never escape you 
So let the choir sing for tonight I'm an easy mark (hey now) 
Hey now, am I acting just a little too proud? 

There's no love, there's no hate 
I left them there for you to take 
But know that every word was a piece of my heart (hey now) 
Have I said too much 
Maybe I haven't said enough 
But know that every word was a piece of my heart (hey now) 

Hush me darling, maybe I've lost my touch 
Maybe I've lost my guts 
There, is that truth enough? 
Hey now, hey now... 

[Guitar solo]

You know these love letters mix with whisky 
Just don't light a match when you kiss me 
Though I'll blow away, you know I'll be back soon (hey now) 
Hey now, hey now, hey now, am I talking just a little too loud? 

There's no love, there's no hate 
I left them there for you to take 
But know that every word was a piece of my heart (hey now) 
Have I said too much 
Maybe I haven't said enough 
But know that every word was a piece of my heart 
Hey now, am I talking just a little too proud? 
Hey now, the night's just bringing me down",Every Word Was a Piece of My Heart
Jon Bon Jovi,"You know your favorite old pair of shoes
The ones with the hole in the toe you won't lose
Your favorite record that's all scratched and used
But still you love to play when your feeling blue

That faded rose that's all dried out
Those Bukowski poems we couldn't live without
Your high school picture when you had wild hair
That stormy day on the beach that got us here

Oh, you better believe there's just one thing you need
Oh can't you see?

It's just me baby
It's just me baby
If there's just one thing that you should keep
In your book of dreams, it's just me baby

Just like a shadow 10 feet tall
Standin' right behind you should you fall
I'll be the one to hold you up to walk
When this wicked world makes us want to crawl

And if your waves should ever break at sea
I'll be there waitin, I'm that sandy beach
I'm that same old dog, scratchin' those same fleas
I'll be by your side, you can count on me

It's just me baby
It's just me baby
If there's just one thing that you should keep
In your book of dreams

It's just me baby
It's just me baby
What's it gonna take to make you see
What's it gonna take 'til you believe in me

Oh, how my smile fades and my heart just breaks
Every time you go away

It's just me baby
It's just me baby
If there's one more thing that you should keep
In your book of dreams

It's just me baby
It's just me baby
What's it gonna take to make you see
What's it gonna take 'til you believe in me

And if someday some new memory comes along
Lookin' shiny new, feelin' really strong
You can tell him that I'll tell him, he can just move on
I'm a fighter, I've been fightin' for you all night long

It's just me baby
It's just me
It's just me baby
It's just me

Jon Bon Jovi,"Sitting here just watching you sleep 
Wish I could slip inside and be 
In some technicolor dream 
But the air's too thick for one of us to breathe 
I'm not fool enough to think 
You couldn't live life without me 

I didn't come this far to throw the towel in 
I didn't fight this hard to walk away 
If I ain't smart enough to say I'm sorry 
It's just because the words got in the way 

I remember how it used to be 
I was you and you were me 
We were more than just the same 
Now these shoes don't fit, my skin's too tight 
When you want a kiss, I take a bite 
Let your heart call up the cops, read me my rights 

Last night I drank enough to drown 
Raise a toast to your good looks and to my health 
Look, we both know how much I've let you down 
Janie don't you take your love to town 

Janie don't you take your love to town 
Janie don't you take your love to town 
If I've got to beg, I'll beg, just don't walk away 
Janie don't you take your love to town 

You deserve a shooter, a saint 
Someone to give it to you straight 
To find the soul thought flesh and bone 
My life's a treasure, full of sunny weather 
But it's left me feeling cold 
Now all you want to do is take me home 

I hated you, the night you said you loved me 
I hated you, 'cause I couldn't love myself 
I'm begging you now, baby please just hold me 
I got one foot in, one foot off the ground 

Janie don't you take your love to town 
Janie don't you take your love to town 
If I've got to beg, I'll beg, just don't walk away 
Janie don't you take your love to town 

Sitting here while you're fast asleep 
In the bathroom by the sink 
Trying to write the right words down 
I turn out the lights, close my eyes 
There ain't no prayers or kiss goodnight 
What I'll forget to say tomorrow, I'll say now 
Janie don't you take your love to town 

Janie don't you take your love to town 
Janie don't you take your love to town 
If I've got to beg, I'll beg, just don't walk away

Down this open road 
The arms of pity 
Wait to greet me tonight in little city 

In my rear view mirror 
I see someone else's hairline 
I hear that fire in your eyes 
Is on the rock and doing hard time 

And the grapes of wrath, they're on the vine 
There's wine in this dirt 
Here love ain't love

Jon Bon Jovi,"The kids 'round here look just like sticks
They trade old licks with a beat up six
I just smile and catch the groove

Gothic girls all dress in black
Serious as heart attacks
It takes a little bit of getting used to

The old man with the whiskey stains
Lost the night forgot his name
His poor wife will sleep alone again
And it ain't hard to understand
Why she's holding on to her own hand

Seems her chauffeur took a dive
And sold her secrets to the sun
And later in a magazine
I finally figured what it means
To be a saint, not a queen

Two lustful lovers catch a spark
And chase their shadows in the dark
Someone's getting off tonight
Of a big red bus that's packed so tight
It disappears in a trail of light
Somewhere someone's dreaming baby it's all right...

No one's asking me to bleed

When chelsea girls sing...

It's morning when i go to sleep
In the distant dawn a church bell rings
Another day is coming on
A baby's born, an old man dies
Somewhere young lovers kiss good-bye
I leave my soul and just move on
And wish that i was there to sing this song

Knocked me clean off my feet 
Her tongue kept on selling 
What any blind man could see 
I just kept on stumbling through the stop signs

The night is fading, like my old tattooA heart and a dagger, that says ""Forever""
Chorus:Staring at your window with a suitcase in my handThe streetlights buzz as the cars roll by and the moon don't give a damnI'm getting tired of talkin', even I don't understandWhy I'm staring at your window with a suitcase in my hand

Jon Bon Jovi,"If you're ugly, i'm ugly too
In your eyes the sky's a different blue
If you could see yourself like others do
You'd wish you were as beautiful as you

And i wish i was a camera sometimes
So, i could take your picture with my mind
Put it in a frame for you to see
How beautiful you really are to me

Ugly, ugly
All of us just feel like that somedays
Ain't no rainbow in the sky
When you feel u.g.l.y.
And that's ugly, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ugly, ugly
All of us just feel like that somedays
Ain't no rainbow in the sky
When you feel u.g.l.y.
And that's ugly, ugly
All of us just feel like that somedays
Ain't no cure that you can buy
When you feel u.g.l.y.
And that's ugly

So, if you're ugly, i'm ugly too
If you're a nut, then i must be a screw
If you couls see yourself the way i do
You'd wish you were as beautiful as you
I wish i was as beautiful as you",Ugly
Jon Bon Jovi,"Hey babe, it's me parked outside your house
I know that he's asleep, so listen to me now
Darlin', I'm tired of living just in your dreams
I'm getting out
You know we both sold our souls
We're just growing old, in this sleepy, dead-end town

Destination anywhere
Name the place and I'll be there
Pack a bag a we're out of here - let's run

Baby, we both been running uphill for too long
We both settled for something, got nothing
And we both know it's wrong
Go on admit it we lived it, I'm leaving -
Get your boots and come on
I got my coat and my keys, I need you next to me, then I'm gone

Destination anywhere
Name the place and I'll be there
Pack a bag a we're out of here - let's run
Destination anywhere
Left of right, I don't care
Maybe we'll just disappear like the sun

When these wheels spin, they can all eat our dust
As far as I'm concerned, this whole town's lost
It's nuts
We won't be here when they put us down
It's our big chance and I'm calling you now
They'll never let us go unless we try
I'm tired of living just to die
We're getting out of here, destination anywhere

Destination anywhere
Name the place and I'll be there
Pack a bag a we're out of here - let's run
Destination anywhere
Left of right, I don't care
Maybe we'll just disappear like the sun, come on, come on, come on",Destination Anywhere [DVD]
Jon Brion,"Are you dead to the world?

It appears that you might be
A little dead to the world
Or at least a bit to all of those
Who have shown a true affection
You make a mess of those
Who will care without exception
As you pile drive through anything that stands
In your way or blocks your view

Are you dead to the world?

I've gotta wonder if you are
A little dead to the world
With a reflex that is uncontrolled
It's the only explanation
Unless you're just as cold
As they say and just as calculating
Using and debilitating those
Who can see the good in you

Lost sight of it
I made light of it
Everyone makes mistakes
We fell by the wayside
We fell out of place
I wish I could say that we'd fallen from grace
But we never made it to that place",Dead to the World
Jon Brion,"I might not have anything to offer you
I might not have anything to say that's new
But you've gotta start somewhere
Oh, you've gotta start somewhere

So infinite and scary too
Just ask for it
And it's coming true
I continue in hope I have a follow-up
And if I do then you might not ever shut me up

But you've gotta start somewhere
Oh, you've got to start somewhere

So I prepare to follow through
Why should I care
What it is to you?

Get a load of the lengths I got to avoid
Even admitting that I'm qualified
And I'm aware of the need to let it ride

But you've gotta start somewhere
Oh, you've gotta start somewhere
Yeah, you've gotta start somewhere

If, and, or but will have to do
This story's what I'm sticking to
For it might not address the need for more
And it might be less than I'm hoping for
It's just what It's coming to
Just ask for it and it's coming true 

But you've gotta start somewhere
Oh, you've gotta start somewhere
Yeah, you've gotta start somewhere
Just ask for it and it's coming true",Gotta Start Somewhere
Jon Brion,"Her ghost is six or so feet tall
And the lights in the house are dim
His voice still echoes through the hall
She can't get away from him

I clear the couch off and I sit
She hangs up the phone and then
She says she can't believe he quit
But I know he'll be back again

Every hour on the hour
He will reappear and make it clear that he's around
It's not your average social call
He does it all without a sound

Her ghost is propped up in the hall
He speaks no evil there
He doesn't notice me at all
I find it a bit unfair

I'm bathed in shadow from that wall
I know he'll be in the air

Every hour on the hour
She'll watch her apparition stare her down, but pass her by
And I've no ammunition 
I'm the one who's being exorcised

Every hour on the hour
Every moment all my power
And every where I turn 
I tend to learn that she's got 
Memories that never burn

And this is of concern and I prepare to go 
'Cause this I know 
That though he's out of sight 
He's in her mind and in my hair
I'm tiring of this fight
Besides it's getting me nowhere

Her ghost makes all of this occur
He does it breathlessly
So long as he's the life in her
He'll be the death of me",Her Ghost
Jon Brion,"Although she's none the wiser
Although we've barely met
I can recognize her
From the treatment that I get

So it's my duty to advise her
If she breaks the rules
I've said I'll quit though
I'll admit that hasn't happened yet

I believe she's lying

I trust her to undermine my faith in her, in time
I have every confidence that she'll dismantle mine
Given time

As sure as she is sitting here
She's sure that she's awake
And as soon as we're committing
We're admitting our mistake

So of course it's only fitting
That the course we're going to take
Is drawn and whereupon I'm slamming on the brakes

I believe she's lying

I trust her to undermine my faith in her, in time
I have every confidence that she'll dismantle mine
Given time
It's a given, given time

The power of suggestion
The element of chance
And the subject now in question
Is the same old song and dance

And the time that we invest in
Setting traps out in advance
So we could spend the weekend staring in a trance

I believe she's lying
I trust her to undermine my faith in her, in time
I have every confidence that she'll dismantle mine
Given time
It's a given, given time
It's a given, given time",I Believe She's Lying
Jon Brion,"Oil tankers in the National Guard
I came to meet you, my car died in your yard
Why turn the key?
There's so much here to see
These are my memories

Of precious places, precious things
That were meaningless before
We'd seen them together

Old hinges squeaking in the rain
That hotel by the highway where we stayed
There's something every hour
Who needs the Eiffel Tower
When we've got memories

Of precious places, precious things
That were meaningless before
We'd seen them together

The pen, the car
The paint, the pier
The moon and star
The message clear
Liberty raised her hand to us
As if to say, ''It's OK, live today, live today''

I said, ''Don't leave me, don't break the tie''
Then I left you and the time went rolling by
And here's what I can't stand
I know that every landmark 
Triggers memories
Of stupid places and silly things
That were meaningless before
We'd seen them together (repeat 3x)",Meaningless
Jon Brion,"I know it's today so I guess you could say one recovers
Thought you should call me but then after all we were lovers
I don't wait by the phone like I used to
I don't hope for kind words you might say
You don't prey on my mind like you used to
But you can still ruin my day
You can still ruin my day

You're telling me now you regret how we never connected
Oh as if you forget that it's me you regret you rejected
I don't easily forgive like I used to
And I seldom get carried away
No you don't have the pull that you used to
But you can still ruin my day
Oh you can still ruin my day

Love, it was nothing 
It hardly hurt a bit

Sounds good to me but unfortunately I remember it
Now I don't lose my place like I used to
I'm not moved by your ? display
No you can't draw me in like you used to
But you can still ruin my day
You can still ruin my day
You can still ruin my day

You can still ruin my day
I said you can still ruin my day",Ruin My Day
Jon Brion,"I got tired, I killed it through and through
I don't wanna make the same mistakes
The same mistakes with you

I didn't lie, but I withheld the truth
I don't wanna make the same mistakes
The same mistakes with you

The line is thin between a selfish act
And things you do to keep yourself intact
I could name a few

I did a lot that I could not undo
I don't wanna make the same mistakes
The same mistakes with you",Same Mistakes
Jon Brion,"Here's the face of trouble
It's the face I wear
And it may invite you in
But I won't go there

Here's a working model
That generates despair
And this baby cranks it out
And it will take you out
And I won't care

It's a beauty

It's the mark of someone
Who's beyond repair
He'll refuse to help himself
Thinking only of himself
And though he isn't by himself
Well it's your job now

There's a conversation
We're about to have
And it's full of twists and turns
Half truths and vague concerns
From one who never learns
To one who never learns
And I never learn

Here's the face of trouble
",Trouble
