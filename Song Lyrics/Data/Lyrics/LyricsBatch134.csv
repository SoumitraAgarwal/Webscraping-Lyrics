Garrin Benfield,"Yesterday I heard you lie
But who am I to say
What to you may be alright
To me is not OK

I won't go on with my apology
I don't have one to tell you anyway
It's not so easy

They say to open is to love
To free your love is kind
But you and I we know the truth
Has more to it in mind
If everone could feel a bit of this
They'd understand
Where we were comin' from 
It's not so easy

Open wide
I fear that I've been taken
For a ride
I speak but I'm too shaken
To form a thought
Or try a conversation
I think you ought
To take a long vacation

Yesterday we pulled apart
And left ourselves a choice
Try and answer to the heart
Or drown in our own noise
You keep me up talking in my sleep
I call you up 'cause I can't let you be
It's not so easy",Vacation
Garrin Benfield,"I can hear her heart beat for a thousand miles
And the heavens open every time she smiles
And when I come to her that's where I belong
Yet I'm running to her like a river's song

[Chorus:]
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief

[Chorus]

Yes I need her in the daytime
Yes I need her in the night
Yes I want to throw my arms around her
Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight

And when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day
Yes it makes me righteous, yes it makes me feel whole
Yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul",Crazy Love
Garrison Elliott,"I try to keep  you out of my heart
But somehow I find
Trying to keep you out of my heart
I'm out of my mind
I tell myself ""I'm through with you
And I'll having nothing more to do with you""
I stay away, but every day
I'm just foolin myself

Tell my friends that I don't care
I shrug my shoulders at the whole affair
But all know it isn't so
I'm just foolin myself

And every time I pass
And see my face in a looking glass
I tip my hat and say
""How do you do, you fool
You're trowing your life away""
I'm acting gay
I'm acting proud
And every time I see you in a crowd
I may pretend
But in the end
I'm just fooling myself",Foolin' Myself
Garrison Fewell,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?

Garrison Fewell,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love
Garrison Keillor,"o little town of bethlehem
how still we see thee lie!
above thy deep and dreamless sleep
the silent stars go by
yet in thy dark streets shineth
the ever lasting light
the hopes and fears of all the years
are met in thee tonight

for christ is born of mary
and gathered all above
while mortals sleep, the angels keep
their watch of wandering love
o morning stars, together
proclaim the holy birth
and praises sing to god the king
and peace to men on earth

o holy child of bethlehem!
descend to us, we pray
cast out our sin and enter in

Garrison Keillor,"Well it don't matter if I get my picture
On the cover of a magazine

And my soul's got a stain to clean
But there ain't no way to pay to get sanctified

But it's no big deal and you know I

Garrison Keillor,"Well lightning struck at midnight with the thunder and the rain
My sleep was interrupted by the rhythm of a train
I asked of the conductor where this old train was bound
He punched my ticket then he whispered, ""Memphis Town""

But there ain't no train to Memphis anymore
You've got to take the highway when you go
Well them rusty tracks from Nashville
Lay beside that stretch of road
But there ain't no train to Memphis any more

Well I pinched myself and crossed my heart to see if it was real
Or was I just imagining the grinding of the wheels
I swore I heard that whistle and the clic-kity clack
As I rode that phantom streamline on a west bound track

Because there ain't no train to Memphis anymore
You've got to take the highway when you go
Well them rusty tracks from Nashville
Lay beside that stretch of road
But there ain't no train to Memphis any more

Well we cruised into the delta like we woke up from a dream
I felt a bit confused 'cause I was blinded by the steam
Well I said, ""I come from Nashville and I just got off the train""
And that driver looked at me as if he thought I was insane

Because there ain't no train to Memphis anymore
You've got to take the highway when you go
Well them rusty tracks from Nashville
Lay beside that stretch of road
But there ain't no train to Memphis any more
",No Train to Memphis
Garrison Keillor,"Is the struggle and strife we find in this life
Really worth while, after all
I've been wishing today I could just run away
Out where the west winds call

With someone like you, a pal good and true
I'd like to leave it all behind and go and find
Some place that's known to god alone
Just a spot to call our own
We'll find perfect peace, where joys never cease
Out there beneath a kindly sky
We'll build a sweet little nest somewhere in the west
And let the rest of the world go by

Is the future to hold just struggles for gold
While the real world waits outside
Away out on the breast of the wonderful west
Across the great divide

With someone like you, a pal good and true
I'd like to leave it all behind and go and find
Some place that's known to god alone
Just a spot to call our own
We'll find perfect peace, where joys never cease
Out there beneath a kindly sky
We'll build a sweet little nest somewhere in the west
And let the rest of the world go by",Let the Rest of the World Go By
Garrison Keillor,"Life is such a great adventure
Learn to live it as you go
No one in the world can censure 
What we do here below
 
Don't save your kisses, just pass them around
You'll find my reason is logic'lly sound
Who's going to know that you passed them around
A hundred years from today!
Why crave a penthouse that's fit for a queen
You're nearer Heaven on Mother Earth's green
If you had millions what would they all mean
A hundred years from today
So laugh and sing, make love the thing
Be happy while you may
There's always one, beneath the sun
Who's bound to make you feel that way
The moon is shining, and that's a good sign
Cling to me closer and say you'll be mine
Remember, darling, we won't see it shine

Garrison Keillor,"I've traveled 'round this country 
from shore to shining shore 
It really made me wonder 
the things I heard and saw 

I saw the weary farmer 
plowing sod and loam 
l heard the auction hammer 
just a-knocking down his home 

But the banks are made of marble 
with a guard at every door 
and the vaults are stuffed with silver 
that the farmer sweated for 

I've seen the weary miner 
scrubbing coal dust from his back 
I heard his children cryin' 
""Got no coal to heat the shack"" 

But the banks are made of marble 
with a guard at every door 
and the vaults are stuffed with silver 
that the miner sweated for 

I've seen my brothers working 
throughout this mighty land 
l prayed we'd get together 
and together make a stand 

Then we might own those banks of marble 
with a guard at every door 
and we might share those vaults of silver 
that we have sweated for

Garrison Keillor,"Where you been Johnny?
What you been doin'?

I'm just fiddlin' round

I played this guitar till my folks were sick of it

Garrison Keillor,"I am an orphan on God's highway
But I'll share my troubles if you go my way
I have no mother no father

I am an orphan girl

I have had friendships pure and golden
But the ties of kinship I have not known them
I know no mother no father
No sister no brother

To meet my family at God's table
I'll meet my mother my father

In a world of darkness

Garrison Starr - Beautiful in Los Angeles


You are brilliant, but

You're amazing, what

Whatever I say, we'll be so safe

If my bubble pops

If my world gets rocked

I can say you could be anyone today


Are you still beautiful in los angeles

It's been so long, I can't handle it

Does it really make any difference

Cause I'm so far away

And you will never change


Between eastern time

And really predictable lines

You make a pretty good case for

That lost look on your face

Tell me are you curious

Will you be curious enough to stay awake

When you finally feel your heart break


And I'm so beautiful in los angeles

When it's been so long you can't handle it

Will it really make any difference

Cause I'm so far away

And you will never change


I never get the chance to rehearse

And I can't explain it, for what it's worth

Will I ever get the chance to be true

Alone in a room with you


Where whatever we say

We're so safe, so safe


Are you still beautiful in los angeles

It's been so long I can't handle it

Will it ever make any difference

I'm so far away

I'm so far away

Will we ever change

Garth Brooks,"Blame it all on my roots
I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair
The last one to know
The last one to show
I was the last one you thought you'd see there
And I saw the surprise
And the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you
Said ""honey, we may be through""
But you'll never hear me complain

'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places

Well, I guess I was wrong
I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
Everything's all right
I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
Hey, I didn't mean
To cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then
Well, I'll be as high as that ivory tower
That you're livin' in

'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places

I've got friends in low places

And the beer chases my blues away

I carried his mother up hill and down
I carried her safely to Bethlehem town

I gave him my hay for to pillow his head

I have him my wool for his blanket warm
And he wore my coat on that Christmas morn

Garth Brooks,"A poor orphan girl named Maria
Was walking to market one day
She stopped for a rest by the roadside
Where a bird with a broken wing lay
A few moments passed till she saw it
For it's feathers were covered with sand
But soon clean and wrapped it was traveling
In the warmth of Maria's small hand

She happily gave her last peso
On a cage made of rushes and twine
She fed it loose corn from the market
And watched it grow stronger with time

Now the Christmas Eve service was coming
And the church shone with tinsel and light
And all of the townfolk brought presents
To lay by the manger that night
There were diamonds and incense and perfumes
In packages fit for a king
But for one ragged bird in a small cage
Maria had nothing to bring

She waited till just before midnight
So no one could see her go in
And crying she knelt by the manger
For her gift was unworthy of Him

Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness
Maria, what brings you to me
If the bird in the cage is your offering
Open the door, let me see
Though she trembled, she did as he asked her
And out of the cage the bird flew
Soaring into the rafters
On a wing that had healed good as new

Just then the midnight bells rang out
And the little bird started to sing
A song that no words could recapture
Whose beauty was fit for a king

Now Maria felt blessed just to listen
To that cascade of notes sweet and long
As her offering was lifted to heaven
By the very first nightingale's song",The Gift

By the light of one bright star

Took refuge in a stable

There came a great rejoicing on the earth

And they sang, glory to God in the highest
Dawning that first Christmas morn
Peace on earth and tidings of great joy

And, lo, these many years since then
That ancient star still guides us
And now again our Christmas voices ring
Blessed we are and safe at home

Garth Brooks,"Sometimes late at night
I lie awake and watch her sleeping
She's lost in peaceful dreams
So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
And the thought crosses my mind
If I never wake up in the morning
Would she ever doubt the way I feel
About her in my heart
If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way
To show her every day
That she's my only one
If my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes
'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelings for them never were revealed
So I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance
To tell her how I feel
If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way
To show her every day
That she's my only one
If my time on earth were through

Garth Brooks,"Papa drove a truck nearly all his life
You know it drove mama crazy being a trucker's wife
The part she couldn't handle was the being alone
I guess she needed more to hold than just a telephone
Papa called Mama each and every night
Just to ask her how she was and if us kids were alright
Mama would wait for that call to come in
When Daddy'd hang up then she was gone again
Mama was a looker
Lord, how she shined
Papa was a good'n
But the jealous kind
Papa loved Mama
Mama loved men
Mama's in the graveyard
Papa's in the pen
Well, it was bound to happen and one night it did
Papa came home and it was just us kids
He had a dozen roses and a bottle of wine
If he was lookin' to surprise us, he was doin' fine
I heard him cry for mama up and down the hall
Then I heard a bottle break against the bedroom wall
That old diesel engine made an eerie sound
When Papa fired it up and headed into town
Well, the picture in the paper showed the scene real well
Papa's rig was buried in the local motel
The desk clerk said he saw it all real clear
He never hit the brakes when he was shifting gears

Ever changin' as it flows
And a dreamer's just a vessel

Just to stay between the shores

And let the waters slip away
'Til what we put off 'til tomorrow

And say you're satisfied
Choose to chance the rapids
And dare to dance that tide

Warm breeze stirring up a soft moonlight
And my mind started drifting to way back when

And for the briefest moment I felt a smile begin
Yes I do think about you every now and then

Between what you and me had and the life I've made

The same one you always asked me to play
And when the song was over 
I wished they played it again

Those hearts that have no scars to show
The ones that never do let go
And risk it the tables being turned

Who have to dance within the flame
Who chance the sorrow and the shame
That always come with getting burned

But you got to be tough when consumed by desire
'Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire
We call them strong
Those who can face this world alone
Who seem to get by on their own
Those who will never take the fall

We call them weak
Who are unable to resist
The slightest chance love might exist
And for that forsake it all

They're so hell bent on giving, walking a wire
Convinced it's not living if you stand outside the fire

Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire

There's this love that is burning
Deep in my soul
Constantly yearning to get out of control
Wanting to fly higher and higher
I can't abide standing outside the fire

Garth Brooks,"Oh  the snowflakes fell in silence 
Over Belleau Wood that night 
For a Christmas truce had been declared 
By both sides of the fight 
As we lay there in our trenches 
The silence broke in two 
By a German soldier singing 
A song that we all knew 
Though I did not know the language 
The song was ""Silent Night"" 
Then I heard my buddy whisper  
""All is calm and all is bright"" 
Then the fear and doubt surrounded me 
'Cause I'd die if I was wrong 
But I stood up on my trench 
And I began to sing along 
Then across the frozen battlefield 
Another's voice joined in 
Until one by one each man became 
A singer of the hymn 
Then I thought that I was dreaming 
For right there in my sight 
Stood the German soldier 
'Neath the falling flakes of white 
And he raised his hand and smiled at me 
As if he seemed to say 
Here's hoping we both live 
To see us find a better way 
Then the devil's clock struck midnight 
And the skies lit up again 
And the battlefield where heaven stood 
Was blown to hell again 
But for just one fleeting moment 
The answer seemed so clear 
Heaven's not beyond the clouds 
It's just beyond the fear 
No, heaven's not beyond the clouds 
It's for us to find it here",Belleau Wood

Garth Brooks,"His pulpit's a corner at 19th and Main
His grip on the gospel is his one claim to fame
He hurls fire and brimstone at the cars passin' by
He offers salvation from the savior on high

His khakis are tattered, he ain't bathed in weeks
His bouts with the bottle show up on his cheeks
He looks like a scarecrow, a sight to behold
While he works for the shepherd, bringin' lambs to the fold

He points to the Bible he holds in his hand
Says, I'm proof that the good Lord can save any man

Son, it ain't what you're drivin' or the clothes that you wear
Material possessions won't matter up there
Someday in heaven with the angels I'll sing
And these rags that I'm wearin' will be fit for a king

He's fightin' a fever, in spite of the chills
He pulls up his collar and speaks of God's will
His body is weakened but his faith is still strong
He's filled with conviction for the mission he's on

'Cause a mansion is waitin', he'll be homeless no more
And his words will still echo from that far distant shore

We're buddies
And we've been since we first met
Me any you
Well we've sure been through
Our share of laughter and regret
Lord knows we've had our bad days
And more than once we've disagreed
But you've always been a friend to me
You can be so stubborn
There's times I think you just like to fight
And I hope and pray
I live to see a day
When you say I might be right
And there's times I'd rather kill you
Than listen to your honesty
But you've always been a friend to me
You've always been
Time and again

Just the way I am

Garth Brooks,"Drove to the church 
In my suit and tie 
But I just couldn't bring myself 
To go inside 
So I sat alone 
In my truck across the street 
Watched that chauffeur smokin' cigarettes 
By that long white limousine 
I could just imagine 
What was goin' on in there 
Sunlight streamin' through the stained glass 
And those flowers in her hair 
And in less time than it takes a tear to fall 
Those bells rang loud as thunder 
As they opened up the doors 
Now I don't have to wonder anymore 
Laughin' and a cryin' 
Tossin' that bouquet 
And when you got in that limo 
I drove off the other way 
And I still don't know 
Why things happened like they did 
But I parked that old pickup 
On that lonesome river bridge 
I took your ring from my pocket 
And I held it one last time 
Watched that diamond sparkle 
I drew back and I let her fly 
And in less time than it takes to tear to fall 
Oh that old ring went under 
Lord and now it's gone for sure 
No and I don't have to wonder anymore 
Well the angels sang like thunder

And it scared me so much 
That I just wouldn't budge 
I might have stayed there forever 
If not for your touch 
Oh but you move me 
Out of myself and into the fire

And with hope and desire

And if there ever was somebody
Who made me believe in me
It was you

It was your song that made me sing
It was your voice that gave me wings
And it was your light that shined
Guiding my heart to find
This place where I belong
It was your song

Before the music starts to play
That I'll do my best and I won't let you down

Guess I ain't too diplomatic
I just never been the kind to go along
Just avoidin' confrontation
For the sake of conformation

And I'll admit I tend to sing a different song
But sometimes you just can't be afraid
To wear a different hat
If Columbus had complied
This old world might still be flat

Nothin' ventured, nothin' gained
Sometimes you've got to go against the grain
Well, I have been accused
Of makin' my own rules
There must be rebel blood
Just a-runnin' through my veins
But I ain't no hypocrite
What you see is what you get
And that's the only way I know
To play the game
Old Noah took much ridicule
For building his great ark
But after forty days and forty nights
He was lookin' pretty smart
Sometimes it's best to brave the wind and rain
By havin' strength to go against the grain
Well, there's more folks than a few
Who share my point of view
But they're worried
If they're gonna sink or swim
They'd like to buck the system
But the deck is tacked against 'em
And they're a little scared
To go out on a limb
But if you're gonna leave your mark
You can't follow like a bunch of sheep
You got to listen to your heart
Go bustin' in like old John Wayne

He was ten and it was 1952 
His daddy worked hard from sunup to sundown 
And the goin' got tough behind them ol' grey mules 

The farm grew to be a moneymaker 
And the house he lived in grew up room by room 
The boy worked hard but soon got tired of farmin' 
So he slipped away one night 'neath the harvest moon 

His neck was red as Alabama clay 
But the city's call pulled him away 
He's got a factory job and runs a big machine 
He don't miss the farm or the fields of green 

Now the city's just a prison without fences 
His job is just a routine he can't stand 
And at night he dreams of wide-open spaces 
Fresh dirt between his toes and on his hands 

Then one day a picture came inside a letter 
Of a young girl with a baby in her arms 
And the words she wrote would change his life forever 
So he went to raise his family on the farm 

His neck is red as Alabama clay 
Now he's goin' home this time to stay 
Where the roots run deep on the family tree 
And the tractor rolls through the fields of green

And when I rise a flame for you 
Always too shy to carry the whole thing through 

Like the light from that eternal flame 
Burns for one without a name 
My love forever will remain anonymous 

Oh you'll always wonder who it was 
Who it was 
It was just anonymous 

Well I wrote our names a thousand times 
Just to see yours sitting next to mine 
And I sent you flowers cards unsigned",Anonymous [#]
Garth Brooks,"They packed up all his buckles and shipped his saddle to his dad
And by the way the house looked, she must have took it bad
The workers come on Monday to fix the door and patch the wall
They say she just went crazy the night she got the call

He was up in Wyoming and drew a bull no man could ride
He promised her he'd turn own well it turned out that he lied
And the dreams that they'd been living in the California sand
Died right there beside him in Cheyenne

They say she just went crazy screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean and to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water you'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne

They never found her body, just her diary by the  bed
It told about the fight they had and the words that she had said
When he told her he was ridin'  she said, 'Then I don't give a damn
If you never come back from Cheyenne?

They say she just went crazy screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean and to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water you'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne

Nobody can explain it, some say she's still alive
They'd even claim they've seen her on the shoreline late at night
And if you go down by the water, you'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne

'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne",The Beaches of Cheyenne
Garth Brooks,"Yesterday she thanked me
For oiling that front door
This morning when she wakes
She won't be thankful anymore

She'll never know how much I cared
Just that I couldn't stay
Shell never know the reason why
I always run away

Burning bridges
One by one
What I'm doing 
Can't be undone

And I'm always hoping someday
I'm gonna stop this running round
But every time the chance comes up
Another bridge goes down

Last night we talked of old times
Families  and home towns
She wondered if we both agree on
Where we'd settle down

And I told her that we'd cross that bridge
Whenever it'd arrive
Now through the flames I see her standing
On the other side

Burning bridges
One by one
What I'm doing 
Can't be undone

And I'm always hoping someday
I'm gonna stop this running round
But every time the chance comes up
Another bridge goes down

Like ashes on the water
I drift away in sorrow
Knowing that the day my lessons finally learned
I'll be standing at a river
Staring out across tomorrow 
And the bridge I need to get there
Will be a bridge that I have burned

Burning bridges
One by one
What I'm doing 
Can't be undone

And I'm always hoping someday
I'm gonna stop this running round
But every time the chance comes up
Another bridge goes down

Another bridge goes down",Burning Bridges
Garth Brooks,"I spent last night in the arms of a girl in Louisiana
And though I'm out on the highway, my thoughts are still with her
Such a strange combination of a woman and a child
Such a strange situation stoppin' every hundred miles
Callin' Baton Rouge

A replay of last night's events roll through my mind
Except a scene or two erased by sweet red wine
And I see a truck stop sign ahead, so I change lanes
I need a cup of coffee and a couple dollars change
Callin' Baton Rouge

Operator, won't you put me on through
I gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge
Hurry up, won't you put her on the line
I gotta talk to the girl just one more time

Hello, Samantha dear, I hope you're feelin' fine
And it won't be long until I'm with you all the time
But until then, I'll spend my money up right down to my last dime
Callin' Baton Rouge

Operator, won't you put me on through
I gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge
Hurry up, won't you put her on the line
I gotta talk to the girl just one more time

Garth Brooks,"One hand reaches out
And pulls a lost soul from harm
While a thousand more go unspoken for
And they say,
""What good have you done by saving just this one""
It's like whispering a prayer
In the fury of a storm

And I hear them saying,
""You'll never change things
And no matter what you do
It's still the same thing""
But it's not the world that I am changing
I do this so, this world will know
That it will not change me

This heart still believes
That love and mercy still exist
While all the hatreds rage
And so many say
""That love is all but pointless,
In madness such as this
""It's like trying to stop a fire
With the moisture from a kiss""

And I hear them saying,
""You'll never change things
And no matter what you do
It's still the same thing""
But it's not the world that I am changing
I do this so, this world will know
That it will not change me

As long long as one heart still holds on
Then hope is never really gone

And I hear them saying,
""You'll never change things
And no matter what you do
It's still the same thing""
But it's not the world that I am changing
I do this so, this world we know
Never changes me

What I do is so, this world will know
That it will not change me",The Change
Garth Brooks,"There's a fire burning bright 
At our house tonight 
Slow music playing 
And soft candlelight 
On her lips I keep tasting 
The warm red wine 
I'm there in her arms 
But it's all in my mind 

The snow is piled high on the highway tonight 
I'm a ship lost at sea on this ocean of white 
Eighteen wheels anchored somewhere out of Dover 
I wish I could hold her 
Instead of huggin' this old cold shoulder 

This old highway 
Is like a woman sometimes 
She can be your best friend 
But she's the real jealous kind 
She's the lady that leads me 
To the life I dream of 
She's the mistress that keeps me 
From the ones that I love 
The snow is piled high on the highway tonight 
I'm a ship lost at sea on this ocean of white 
Eighteen wheels anchored somewhere out of Dover 
I wish I could hold her 
Instead of huggin' this old cold shoulder

Garth Brooks,"He told a good story
And all us kids listened
'Bout his life on the border
And the way it was then

And we all believed
And when he would finish
We'd ask the old cowboy
To tell 'em again

You could almost hear
Those prairie winds blowing
His saddle a creakin'
Beneath his old faded jeans

You could taste the dry dust
From the trail he was ridin'
As he sat there and painted
Those west Texas scenes

And the grown-ups would tell us
You boys keep your distance
That old man's just telling you lies
But to all of us kids
Cowboy Bill was a hero
Just as true
As the blue texas sky.

He told of a time
When he rode with the rangers
Down on the pecos
And he saved the day

Outnumbered by plenty
They were almost to cover
With thirty banditos
Headed their way

He looked back just in time
To see a horse stumble
The captain went down
And Bill pulled up on his reigns

Through a flurry of bullets
He rescued the captain
They rode for the sunset
Just the story remains

And the grown-ups would tell us
You boys keep your distance
That old man's just telling you lies
But to all of us kids
Cowboy Bill was a hero
Just as true
As the blue texas sky.

Well I still remember
The day that it happened
We waited and we waited
But Bill never showed

The folks at the feed store
Said they hadn't seen him
So we set out for his place
Down on old grist mill road

And we cried when we found him
Lying there with his memories
The old trunk wide open
Things scattered about

He was clutching a badge
That said Texas Rangers
And an old yellow letter
Said ""Texas is Proud""

And the grown-ups that told us
You boys keep your distance
That old man's just telling you lies
Now... they're all saying
Cowboy Bill was a hero
Just as true
As the blue texas sky.

Just as true
As the blue texas sky.",Cowboy Bill
Garth Brooks,"Pushin horns weren't easy like the movie said it was
And I don't recall no dance hall girls
Or hotel rooms with rugs
You worked hot and tired and nasty
Rode your pony's head too low
There were all the nights you couldn't sleep
'cause it was too damn cold
And you'd sing ""strawberry roan"" and ""little joe""

Like the time we hit the river
And the rains began to fall
And the water was risin' so damn fast
We thought it'd drown us all
We lost a lot of steers that day
And four to five good mounts
But when all the boys rode into camp
We knew that's what counts
And we sang, yippie ti yi yay and ""amazing grace"".

Or the night they broke behind us
And then took us by surprise
I whistled out to bonner, I seen the terror in his eyes
And he rode for all his horse would ride
And I know he done his best
But he crossed over jordan ridin' dunny to his death
And we sang ""bringing in the sheaves"" and ""the rugged cross""
So when you see the cowboy, he's not ragged by his choice
He never meant to bow them legs
Or put that gravel in his voice
He's just chasin' what he really loves
And what's burnin' in his soul
Wishin' to God that he'd benn born a hundred years ago
Still singin' ""strawberry roan"" and ""little joe""

Garth Brooks,"On the eighth day God noticed a problem
For there below Him stood a cowboy alone
Stubborn and proud, reckless and loud
God knew he'd never make it on his own
So God looked out all over creation
And listened as that cowboy prayed
God took passion and thunder
Patience and wonder then He sent down
The best thing that God ever made

Cowboys and angels leather and lace
Salt of the earth meets heavenly grace
Cowboys and angels tested and tried
It's a long way to heaven
And one hell of a ride

Nothin's changed since the dawn of creation
For you will find them together today
And only heaven above them knows why she loves him
But he must be the reason she don't fly away

Garth Brooks,"There was a bad boy in the school yard 
Waited on you every day 
Seemed like every time you turned around 
Well he was standin' in your way 

Well he broke your glasses 
The girls all laughed 
As he pushed you to the floor 
But then you stood up one day knowin' 

You couldn't stand it anymore 
And your gentle hand was finally clenched in rage 
You were face to face 

Face to face with the devil that you've been dreadin' 
Eye to eye finally has arrived 
But bad as it was, well now brother wasn't it better 
Dealin' with him face to face 

Your date showed up with flowers 
And you thought your dreams had come 
But with every passing hour 
You felt it come undone 

Then the night exploded and you begged him no 
But he forever changed your life 
And now he waits a judge and jury 
Thinkin' you'll break down inside 

And with a finger you can put his fists away 
And you're face to face 

Face to face with the devil that you've been dreadin' 
Eye to eye finally has arrived 
But bad as it was, well little sister wasn't it better 
Dealin' with him face to face 

'Cause it'll never go away 
Until the fear that you are runnin' from is finally embraced 

Drivin' by the grave yard 
On a wicked winter's eve 
And you're wonderin' why a man of faith 
Is whistlin' nervously 

Then you stop the car 
And you hold your heart 
'Cause you finally realize 
Hell, the devil ain't in the darkness 

He's a'rattlin' 'round inside 
And with folded hands you truly start to pray 
And you're face to face

Garth Brooks,"He's got a split finger wrap
And his rope's pulled way too tight
He's got a lunatic smile
'Cause he's really drawn deep tonight

He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever
Grab a hold-a anythin' and hold on tight
It hits you like a venom from a rattlesnake bite
We're all here 'cause he's not all there tonight

He takes one last breath
And time turns inside out
Then the gate busts open
To the world he dreams about

He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever
Stick a rope on anything 'cause he don't care
He'd even take a ride in an electric chair
We're all here 'cause he's not all there tonight

He says it's really kind of simple
Keep your mind in the middle
While your butt spins 'round and 'round
Take heed to Sankey's preachin'
Keep liftin' and reachin'
And ridin' like there ain't no clowns

Well what he loves might kill him
But he's got no choice
He's a different breed
With a voice down deep inside
That's screamin' he was born to ride

He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever
Fever makes you crazy 'cause it makes no sense
Like runnin' from your shadow out of self-defense
But he won't run and baby he can't hide
He thinks the odds are even leavin' one hand tied
He gets so tired of hangin' on so tight
I know you think he's crazy, well I think you're right

I know one
This fool keeps wondering why he fell in love at all
But you might need this fool around in case you fall
After the party's over and you've had your fill of fun
If you need a fool to forgive you...i know one

You never know you might be lonely when all your loves have missed

It's plain to see she's tired of hanging on

And tired of what she's getting in return

Garth Brooks,"She was a girl on a wagon train
Haded west across the plains
The train got lost in a summer storm
They couldn't move west and they couldn't go home
Then she saw him ridin' through the rain
He took charge of the wagons and he saved the train
And she looked down and her heart was gone
The train went west but she stayed on
In Lonesome Dove

A farmer's daughter with a gentle hand
A blooming rose in a bed of sand
She loved the man who wore a star
A Texas Ranger known near and far
So they got married and they had a child
But times were touch and the West was wild
So it was no surprise the day she learned
That her Texas man would not return
To Lonesome Dove

Back to back with the Rio Grande
A Christian woman in the devil's land
She learned the language and she learned to fight
But she never learned how to beat the lonely nights
In Lonesome Dove, Lonesome Dove

She watched her boy grow into a man
He had an angel's heart and the devil's hand
He wore his star for all to see
He was a Texas lawman legacy
The one day word blew into town
It seemed the men that shot his father down
Had robbed a bank in Cherico
The only thing 'tween them and Mexico
Was Lonesome Dove

The shadows stretched across the land
As the shots rang out down the Rio Grande
And when the smoke had finally cleared the street
The men lay at the ranger's feet
But legend tells to this very day
That shots were comin' from an alleyway
Though no one knows who held the gun
There ain't no doubt if you ask someone
In Lonesome Dove
Back to back with the Rio Grande
A Christian woman in the devil's land
She learned the language and she learned to fight
But she never learned how to beat the lonely nights
In Lonesome Dove, Lonesome Dove",In Lonesome Dove

Deep within the Emerald Isle

Each time they called the old man out

Fist to fist and eye to eye
Standin' toe to toe
He would've let me walk away
But I just would not let it go

Had lead me to this night
Now he'll pay for all the times that he's been right

And in memory of that fateful night
I know the greatest pain was his
And I just pray some day I'm half the man he is
Just like my older brothers
I crawled back in the house
The night I called the old man out

He said ""Son, it's gonna hurt me more than it hurts you""
But somehow I couldn't help but have my doubt
'Cause I'd seen my older brothers crawl back in the house
Each time they called the old man out",The Night I Called the Old Man Out
Garth Brooks,"One night when I was out ridin'
The graveyard shift, midnight till dawn
The moon was bright, as a readin' light
With a letter from an old friend back home

And he asked me, ""Why do you ride for your money? Tell me, why do you rope for short pay?
You ain't a gettin' nowhere and you're losin' your share.
Boy, you must have gone crazy out there.""

He said, ""Last night, I ran on to Jenny. She's married and she has a good life.
Boy, you sure missed the track, when you never came back.
She's the perfect professional's wife.
And she asked me, 'Why does he ride for his money? Tell me, why does he rope for short pay?
He ain't a gettin' nowhere, and he's losin' his share.
Boy, he must have gone crazy out there.' ""

Ah, but they've never seen the Northern Lights
They've never seen a hawk on the wing
They've never spent spring at the Great Divide
And they've never heard ole Camp Cookie sing 

So I read up the last of my letter
And I tore off the stamp for Black Jim
And when Billy rode up to relieve me
He just looked at my letter and he grinned

And he said, ""Now why do they ride for their money? Tell me, why do they ride for short pay?
They ain't a gettin' nowhere and they're losin' their share
Boy, they must have gone crazy out there
Son, they all must be crazy out there.""",Night Rider's Lament
Garth Brooks,"That night will live forever
Their first time to lie together
They were finally where desire dared them to go
Both belonging to another
But longing to be lovers
Promising each other that the night will only know
Parked on some old backstreet
They laid down in the back seat
And fell into the fire down below
But they would pay for their deceiving
For a deadly web was weaving
Why they picked that spot that evening
Lord, the night will only know
Well within the innuendos
Just outside the steamy windows
The night was shattered by a woman's scream
Motionless and frightened
The grip of fate had tightened
And with trembling hands they wiped away the steam
They saw a woman pleading
Stumbling, begging and retreating'
Til she became the victim of her foe
And they watched her fall in silence
To save their own alliance
But the reason for the violence
Just the night will only know
And every paper ran the story
She was stripped of all her glory
And the told exactly how the woman died
Abandoned and forsaken
Too many pills were taken
And they ruled the woman's death a suicide
Bound by their behavior
They could have been her savior
Now guilt becomes the endless debt they owe
But another crime was committed
And it's never been admitted
Have the guilty been acquitted
Lord, the night will only know",The Night Will Only Know

Garth Brooks,"Oh I said a little prayer tonight before I came on stage
I came walking past the drivers and the locals on the union wage
I asked the good lord up in heaven, let me treat the music right
Then I prayed that Detroit goes wild tonight

Seven pickers and all our gear in a rental van
Playing music, never sleeping and working on a neon tan
We played the barn down in Sanford, Florida
For Bev Roberts out in Camden Park
We plugged it in up east at Bull Run and the place went dark

Back when the old stuff was new
Back before the buses and the hard working boys in the crew
Well it was one big party but the business called it payin' our dues
Back when the old stuff was new

Oh the stories we could tell if it weren't for the code of the road
About the buckboard bear creek cowboys and the grizzly rose
You know the weather turned bad in Scottsdale
A tornado nearly stole the show
But we just danced in the rain and listened to the thunder roll

Back when the old stuff was new
Hats off to the KC, Opry and the Ella gurus
It was one big party, Uncle Joe you know we owe it to you
Back when the old stuff was new

No rules, young fools, comin' from the old school 
Taking on the world alone
Next date, can't wait, tearing up the interstate 
Every place we played was home
Balls out, no doubt this is what it's all about 
Beggin' for a place to play
Swingin' with our low friends, prayin' that it never ends
Wouldn't trade a single day

Two shadows starting to softly combine
The picture they're painting

Thundering moments of tenderness rage
Oh, the red strokes
Tempered and strong (Fearlessly drawn)

Thundering moments of tenderness rage

While he dreams of another

How they two
Will settle down

When it comes to loving you,
I'll do anything you want me to,
I'll do anything at all

Here for all the world to see,

I could walk away from anyone I ever knew,
But I can't walk away from you

I have never had anything have this much control on me
I've worked too hard to call my life my own
And I've made myself a world, and it's worked so perfectly,
But it sure won't now, I can't refuse,
I've never had so much to lose
And I'm shameless

You know it should be easy for a man who's strong
To say he's sorry or admit when he's wrong
I've never lost anything I ever missed,
But I've never been in love like this

I don't have the power now,
I don't want it anyhow,

He barely beat the rain in from the field
And between the backdoor slammin' she heard him say
""Damn this rain and damn this wasted day""
But she'd been waitin' for this day for oh so long
She was standin' in the kitchen with nothin' but her apron on
And in disbelief he stood and he stared a while
When their eyes met, they both began to smile

Somewhere other than the night
She needs to hear I love you
Somewhere other than the night
She needs to know you care
She wants to know she's needed
She needs to be held tight

On the front porch swing

And there are times she feels alone even by his side

Garth Brooks,"She dropped her boy at school on time
One less worry on her mind
Now it's off to work and on the radio
Come's an old familiar song
And then the D.J.'s voice comes on
And say's he's back in town tonight for one last show.

Her eyes well up with tears
God could it be it's been ten years
Since that Autumn night outside the county fair
When two strangers shared a night
And in the darkness found a light
That to this day is still alive and burning there.

He asked her twice to come along
They said good-bye at the break of dawn
'Cause you can't hold back the wind
If it's meant to be again
Then someday he'll find his way back to her arms.

The marquee misspelled his name
And not too many people came
But that didn't matter to them
They laughed and loved all through the night
And as they faced the morning light
They found themselves standing there again.

And he asked her twice to come along
They said good-bye at the break of dawn
As his bus left out she cried
With him standing by her side
That ol' wind had once again found it's way home.
Someday he'll tell her about the money he hid
And someday she'll tell him that the boy is his kid.
But for right now they're both in love

Is that they're finally where their hearts have always been.",That Ol' Wind
Garth Brooks,"I went to work for her that summer
A teenage kid so far from home
She was a lonely widow woman
Hell bent to make it on her own
We were a thousand miles from nowhere
Wheat fields as far as I could see
Both needing something from each other
Not knowing yet what that might be
'Til she came to me one evening
Hot cup of coffee and a smile
In a dress that I was certain

She hadn't worn in quite a while
There was a difference in her laughter
There was a softness in her eyes
And on the air there was a hunger
Even a boy could recognize
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright

Rushing headlong in the wind
Out where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night
That summer wind was all around me
Nothing between us but the night
When I told her that I'd never
She softly whispered ""That's alright""
And then I watched her hands of leather
Turn to velvet in a touch
There's never been another summer
When I have ever learned so much

She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright
Rushing headlong in the wind
Out where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night
I often think about that summer
The sweat, the moonlight and the lace

And I have rarely held another
When I haven't seen her face
And every time I pass a wheat field
And watch it dancing with the wind
Although I know it isn't real
I swear inside I feel
Her hungry arms again
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder

Raging in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright
Rushing headlong in the wind
Out where only dreams have been

And the ocean air is so crisp and clear
And they rave about our view
But there ain't no mountain breeze
And there ain't no hickory trees
And this ain't Tennessee and she ain't you

There's a bedroom suite where she comes to me
And as her fingers touch my face
I close my eyes and I fantasize
Another time and place

What she feels is so warm and real

My wife and I ran into my old high school flame
And as I introduced them the past came back to me

And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine
And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then
I'd never ask for anything again

There wasn't much we could recall

Garth Brooks,"From a phone booth in Cheyenne
I made a promise to Diane
No more rodeos
I'd gone my last go 'round

The same promise that I made
In San Antone and Santa Fe
But tonight I saddled up
And let her down

Wild horses keep draggin' me away
And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday
Wild horses just stay wild
And her heart is all I break
Wild horses keep draggin' me away

She'll watch me drive around her block
Gettin' courage up to stop
To make her one more promise
That I can't keep

The way I love the rodeo
I guess I should let her go
Before I hurt her more
Than she loves me

Wild horses keep draggin' me away
And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday
Wild horses just stay wild
And her heart is all I break
Wild horses keep draggin' me away
Wild horses keep draggin' me away
And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday
Wild horses just stay wild
And her heart is all I break
Wild horses keep draggin' me away",Wild Horses
Garth Brooks,"January's always bitter
But Lord, this one beats all
The wind ain't quit for weeks now
And the drifts are ten feet tall
I been all night drivin' heifers
Closer in to lower ground
Then I spent the mornin' thinkin'
'Bout the ones the wolves pulled down
Charlie Barton and his family
Stopped today to say goodbye
He said the bank was takin' over
The last few years were just too dry
And I promised that I'd visit
When they found a place in town
Then I spent a long time thinkin'
'Bout the ones the wolves pull down
Lord, please shine a light of hope
On those of us who fall behind
And when we stumble in the snow
Could you help us up while there's still time?
Well, I don't mean to be complainin', Lord
You've always seen me through
And I know you got your reasons
For each and every thing you do
But tonight outside my window
There's a lonesome, mournful sound
And I just can't keep from thinkin'
'Bout the ones the wolves pull down
Oh Lord, keep me from bein'
The one the wolves pull down",Wolves

People passing

Some get sweeter every time they're told
That's the way (that's the way) I remember you that way

Guess now if the truth were known
Among diamonds they were stones
To say would be fair, girl, nothing compares
To when I called you all my own

So darling don't ever you think twice
Those were the best days of my life
When I held you there
And I'll tell this story this way, time and again

Garth Brooks,"[Chorus]
Last night I had the strangest dream
I ever dreamed before
'Cause I dreamed the world
Had all agreed to put an end to war

I dreamed I saw a mighty room
Filled with women and men
And the papers they were signing said
They'd never fight again

And when the papers were all signed
And a million copies made
They all joined hands and they bowed their heads
And grateful prayers were prayed

And the people in the streets below
Were dancing 'round and 'round
And swords and guns and uniforms
Were scattered on the ground

[Chorus]",Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream
Garth Brooks,"I know you don't know me
Only our eyes have met
But what yours are saying
Is making me sweat
The dance floor is empty
Why don't you meet me in love

Your breath on my body
The touch of your skin
Your touch is ungodly
And way beyond sin
I've fallen so deeply
Beggin' you meet me in love

Darling please meet me
And I'll whisper sweetly
You're the one
All my life
That I've dreamed of
I've fallen so deeply
I'm yours completely
So darling please meet me forever in love

Lips warm and tender
Ask if I'll always care
Simply surrender
And follow me there
Trust me completely

Ever so sweetly in love",Meet Me in Love

Please operator could you trace this call
Find out where I'm drinking
Which dirty beer hall
And send a cab driver to call for me here
No need to describe me
'Cause I ain't all here

She told me to get lost
And that's what I did

I don't know where I hid
And she swore that she never will see me again
Hell I'll never find me
In the shape that I'm in

If I were me
And I was out drinking
Well where would I be

We were heading to town
She had her sleeves rolled up
And the windows rolled down
That girl is a cowboy

The ""Buckin' Song""
With every word that Keen was bringing
She was singing along
That girl is a cowboy

Sometimes the best cowboys
Ain't cowboys at all
She's got my back
Even when it's against the wall
When I need a friend
She's the guy I call
'Cause sometimes the best cowboys
Ain't cowboys at all

So I took her out to show her
How to rope and ride
I can't believe that it was me
That wound up broke and tied
That girl is a cowboy

So that night I decided
We should paint the town
I made it home although
I really don't remember how
That girl is a cowboy

Momma doesn't know she's leaving
'Til she hears the screen door slamming
Rubber squealin', gears a-jamming
Local country station just a blaring on the radio
Pick him up at seven and they're headin' to the rodeo
Momma's on the front porch screamin' out her warning
Girl you better get your red head
Back in bed before the morning

Nine o'clock the show is ending
But the fun is just beginning
She knows he's anticipating
But she's gonna keep him waiting
Grab a bite to eat
And then they're heading to the honkey tonk

Paying no attention to them highway signs
Doing ninety miles an hour toward the county line
Quick sack, twelve pack, back again
It's a be double - E double - are you N.
My buddies and their babies letting down their hair
As long as we're together it don't matter where
Ain't got a lot of money but we just don't care
Knowing half the fun is getting there
Aztec, long-necks, paychecks spent
oh, it's a be double - E double - are you N.

What the hell they were drinking 
When they made this county dry
I got a week long thirst 
And to make it worse
Lord, it's my turn to drive
Laughing and a bragging and a carrying on
We loaded up the wagons and we headed home
I guess a half a dozen cases doesn't last that long

Janey was lovely, she was the queen of my nights
There in the darkness with the radio playing low
The secrets that we shared
Mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
Till there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove

I remember what she said
How she swore that it never would end
I remember how she held me oh so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then

We were runnin' against the wind
We were young and strong, we were runnin'

Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
I found myself further and further from my home
I guess I lost my way
There were oh so many roads
I was living to run and running to live
Never worried about paying or even how much I owed

Moving eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breaking all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searchin'
Searchin' for shelter again and again

Against the wind
A little something against the wind
I found myself seeking shelter against the wind

Well those drifters days are past me now

Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in, what to leave out

Now Amos Moses was a Cajun
He lived by himself in the swamp
He hunted alligator for livin
He just knock 'em in the head with a stump
The Lousisana law gonna get you Amos!
It ain't legal huntin alligator down in the swamp boy!

Now everyone blamed his old man
For makin him mean as a snake
When Amos Moses was a boy his Daddy would use him for alligator bait
Tie a rope around his waist and throw him in the swamp
Alligator bait in the Lousisana Bayou

About forty-five minutes southeast of Thibodeaux, Lousisiana
Lived a man named Doc Milsap and his pretty wife Hanna
Well they raised up a son who could eat up his weight in groceries
They named him after a man of the cloth
Called him Amos Moses

Now the folks around south Louisiana
Said Amos was a hell of a man
He could trap the biggest, the meanest alligator
And just use one hand
That's all he had left 'cause alligator bit it!
Left arm gone clean up to the elbow!

Well the Sheriff got wind about Amos
Was in the swamp tracking alligator skin
So he snuck in the swamp, gonna get the boy
But he never came out again
Well I wonder where the Louisiana Sheriff went to?
Well you can sure get lost in the Louisiana bayou!

And the slow parade of fears without crying
Now I want to understand

See I have done all that I could
To see the evil and the good without hiding
You must help me if you can

Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what is wrong
Was I unwise to leave them open for so long

'Cause I have wandered through this world
And as each moment has unfurled
I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams
People go just where there will
I never noticed them until I got this feeling
That it's later than it seems

Garth Brooks,"When I was a kid Uncle Remus he put me to bed
With a picture of Stonewall Jackson above my head
Then Daddy came in to kiss his little man
With gin on his breath and a Bible in his hand
He talked about honor and things I should know
Then he’d stagger a little as he went out the door

I can still hear the soft southern winds in the live oak trees
And those Williams boys they still mean a lot to me
Hank and Tennessee
I guess we’re all gonna be what we’re gonna be
So what do you do with good ole boys like me

Nothing makes a sound in the night like the wind does
But you ain’t afraid if you’re washed in the blood like I was
The smell of cape jasmine thru the window screen
John R and the Wolfman kept me company
By the light of the radio by my bed
With Thomas Wolfe whispering in my head

I can still hear the soft southern winds in the live oak trees
And those Williams boys they still mean a lot to me

I guess we’re all gonna be what we’re gonna be
So what do you do with good ole boys like me

When I was in school I ran with a kid down the street
But I watched him burn himself up on Bourbon and speed
But I was smarter than most and I could choose
Learned to talk like the man on the six o’clock news
When I was eighteen Lord I hit the road
But it really doesn’t matter how far I go

Where life's wooly and wild
Came a Air Force brat, in a cowboy hat
And that Copenhagen smile

And from buckin' broncs to honky tonks
He always sang a cowboy song
We were much to young, having too much fun
As we all sang along

And we sang Life's a Highway
There's only one way you're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist, be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight, and just LeDoux it
When that whistle blows, and the crowd explodes
And them pickup-men are at your side
They tell you ""Good ride, cowboy, good ride""

(Take a ride)

Well gold buckles to gold records
Once again he was spinnin' round
Took the whole world on, and he turned us on
To that Western underground

And from bareback jack to this cowboy's hat
The songs were stronger than his pain
He would not slow down, from town to town
Like children running through the rain

And he sang Life's a Highway
There's only one way you're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist, be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight, and just LeDoux it

Garth Brooks,"We met as soul mates
On Parris Island
We left as inmates
From an asylum
And we were sharp
As sharp as knives
And we were so gung ho
To lay down our lives

We came in spastic
Like tameless horses
We left in plastic
As numbered corpses
And we learned fast
To travel light
Our arms were heavy
But our bellies were tight

We had no home front
We had no soft soap
They sent us Playboy
They gave us Bob Hope
We dug in deep
And shot on sight
And prayed to Jesus Christ
With all of our might

We had no cameras
To shoot the landscape
We passed the hash pipe
And played our door's tapes
And it was dark
So dark at night
And we held on to each other
Like brother to brother
We promised our mothers we'd write
And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together

Remember Charlie
Remember Baker
They left their childhood
On every acre
And who was wrong?
And who was right?
It didn't matter in the thick of the fight

We held the day
In the palm
Of our hand
They ruled the night
And the night
Seemed to last as long as six weeks
On Parris Island

We held the coastline
They held the highlands
And they were sharp
As sharp as knives
They heard the hum of our motors
They counted the rotors
And waited for us to arrive
And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together",Goodnight Saigon

Did I try in every way 
To show her every day 
That she's my only one 
If my time on earth were through 
And she must face the world without me 
Is the love I gave her in the past 
Gonna be enough to last 
If tomorrow never comes 
'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life 
Who never knew how much I loved them 
Now I live with the regret 
That my true feelings for them never were revealed 
So I made a promise to myself 
To say each day how much she means to me 
And avoid that circumstance 
Where there's no second chance 
To tell her how I feel 
If tomorrow never comes 
Will she know how much I loved her 
Did I try in every way 
To show her every day 
That she's my only one 
If my time on earth were through 
And she must face the world without me 
Is the love I gave her in the past 
Gonna be enough to last 
If tomorrow never comes 
So tell that someone that you love 
Just what you're thinking of

He was brutally handsome,
And she was terminally pretty
She held him up, and he held her for ransom in the heart
Of the cold, cold city

They had one thing in common, they were good in bed
She'd say, 'Faster, faster. The lights are turnin' red.""

Eager for action and hot for the game

They took all the right pills
They threw outrageous parties, they paid heavenly bills

Lines on her face

We've been up and down this highway
I haven't seen a goddam thing.""
He said, ""Call the doctor. I think I'm gonna crash.""

Messed around and got lost

It's late September and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused but I feel I'm being used
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried any more
You lured me away from home just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart and that's what really hurt

The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age
But that don't worry me none in my eyes you're everything
I laughed at all of your jokes my love you didn't need to coax
Oh, Maggie I couldn't have tried any more
You lured me away from home, just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without

All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover and mother what a lover, you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
In the morning kick me in the head
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried anymore
You lured me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried

I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a Rock and roll band that needs a helpin' hand
Oh Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face
You made a first-class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart but I love you anyway

Garth Brooks,"Just the other night a hometown football game
My wife and I ran into my old high school flame
And as I introduced them the past came back to me
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be

She was the one that I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine
And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then
I'd never ask for anything again

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams
And I could tell that time had changed me
Inn her eyes too it seemed
We tried to talk about the old days
There wasn't much we could recall
I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all

And as she walked away and I looked at my wife
And then and there I thankedd the good Lord
For the gifts in my life

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

Some of God's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered...

Well the G men, T men, revenuers, too

They were looking, tryin to book him,
But my pappy kept a-cookin'

Well I asked my old pappy why he called his brew
White lightnin' 'stead of mountain dew
I took a little sip and right away I knew
As my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue

Clouds of myst'ry fallin'

In his eyes, on his helmet, he had no fear
Down by a six-ball on the ten
Said huddle up boys we’ve got a game to win
He snapped the ball, he looked left and right
Nobody was open so he tucked in tight
And before them boys hanging on to him
The clock ran out as he ran it in

And the whole town cheered
And his mama cried
And they rushed downfield
And they raised him high
Got his picture in the paper and the headline read
""All-American Comeback Kid""

He was recruited by the best schools in the land
He decided he would sign with his Uncle Sam
Kissed his mama goodbye in their living room
Said, dad, don’t worry I’ll be home soon

And the whole town cheered
And his mama cried
And they lined the street
Just to say goodbye
Got his picture in the paper and the headline read
""Come Back, All-American Kid""

Three tours of duty and a silver star
They brought him back home with his battle scars
He stopped off the plane in his combat boots
And he saluted the red, the white and blue

And the whole town cheered
And his mama cried

Made it home alive

Garth Brooks,"I took a short vacation
To the Gulf of Mexico
And everyday I’d see this fellow
With his tackle box and pole
And he’d fish
And he’d fish
All day long

So one day I went out walking
And when I got down to his spot
Me and him we got to talking
I said have you ever thought
About what you are going to do with your life
I said I’m about to share with you
My secret to success
So you can go make something of yourself

You can sell these fish you’re catching
You can buy yourself a boat
Hard work and dedication
And the next thing that you know
You reinvest your money
You’ll be captain of a fleet
You’ll be sitting pretty down on Easy Street
And you can do anything that you wish
He says, you mean fish?

His simple words of wisdom
Hit me right between the eyes
And it really got me thinking
About the way I live my life
'Cause I just work
And I work
All day long

So I asked myself a question
That I knew the answer to
Is success a second mortgage
On a big house with a pool
Or is it a chair
The salt in the air
Wetting the line

That advice that I tried to give him
To take him to the top
Was really nothing more than just a crock

You can sell these fish you’re catching
You can buy yourself a boat
Hard work and dedication
And the next thing you know
You reinvest your money
You’ll be captain of the fleet
You’ll be sitting pretty down on Easy Street
And you can do anything that you wish
He says, you mean fish?

So I went and bought some tackle
And a bucket full of bait
You can find me here most everyday
With my chair sitting there next to his
We just fish
Yeah, we just fish
Yeah fish, fish, fish, fish, fish",Fish

Garth Brooks,"She walked onto the job site
We damn near died
She was a young man’s dream
Full of college and pride
And I called her a kid
And I guess it made her mad
She said don’t call me kid pops and I won’t call you Dad

So I guess you could say we hit it off right from the start
That much difference in age it ain’t a question of hot
One day after work
While she was waiting outside
Said we got to talk
So we went for a ride

She said I’m tired of boys
I’m tired of first dates
And I’m tired of toys
I want a lover that will understand
Someone who will touch me with a knowing hand
I am tired of feeling emptiness inside
I want to be the one left satisfied
I looked around and now I’ve made my choice
I’m tired of big talk and I’m tired of noise
I’m tired of boys

Well I sat there for a moment
And I took a deep breath
I told her I was flattered
But most of all I was scared to death
I bet we talked for hours
'Bout the demons that we dread
Then we went back to her place and put our fears to rest

Well the boys still talk about her
Though she has moved on down the line
They just can’t figure out why she’s in town from time to time
They bet she’s got a lover
I never say a word
I just smile and keep my head down and bless the day I heard

She said I’m tired of boys
I’m tired of first dates
And I’m tired of toys
I want a lover that will understand
Someone who will touch me with a knowing hand
I am tired of feeling emptiness inside
I want to be the one left satisfied

The words fall out my mouth
And onto the floor
I'm needing yeah
To pack up my bags and walk right out the door

This is goodbye
I'll roll the windows down
My old Chevrolet
Don't know where I'm going
I just know that I can't stay

Might make it to Memphis
That ain't far enough
I speed down the highway to Tulsa, Missouri
So fast that the hurt can't catch up
I'm burning your memory
One mile at a time
All the way to Tacoma
By then I hope you're out of my mind

I'm thinking
With a truck stop song and a cold cup of coffee
I'm drinking
Yeah I'm hurting like hell
But honey how could I not be
You make me
Oh the joker, the fool
The last one to know so I'm gonna put
Mountains and deserts and rivers between us
Go as far as I can go

Might make it to Memphis

So fast that the hurt can't catch up

All the way to Tacoma
By then I hope you're out of my mind

Might be some tears in Topeka
A couple of sleepless nights in Cheyenne
And the time that I miss you babe
I'll hit the gas as fast as I can

Missing you like the way that I do
You were right about so many things

You were right about me crying all night hoping
And my heart breaking in two

That I’m starting to think I was wrong about you

If I could do it all over again
I’d do it all a little differently
Slower than that
And I might be able to see
That you were right about me wanting you back baby
As soon as I said we were through

And I rush right over
You talked to me like you never talk to him
And I just don't understand
You hold me like you're scared to let me go
You look at me like I'm invisible

And I don't know why
I am out of my mind
I'm stuck in the rain
Standing in line
Watching your world go by
And I can't believe
That I'm crashing and burning and somehow you can't see
I love the way you wreck me

Tell me what I got to do
To paint me in
Your perfect picture
My heart's running in a race that I can't win
And I can't just can't help myself
I want to write it on the wall for you to see
Would it matter if I got down on my knees

Standing in line
Watching your world go by
And I can't believe
That I'm crashing and burning and somehow you can't see

You've already made a mess of me
And I keep coming back, coming back for more

And I don't know why
I am out of my mind
I'm stuck in the rain
Standing in line
Watching your world go by
And I can't believe
That I'm crashing and burning, I'm tossing and turning
I guess that I'm learning that you're never going to see

Garth Brooks,"We took Ventura Highway to the Sunshine State
Where they raised their hands to Jesus as they passed the plate
Oh, and every day we spent there was Valentine's day
There's a new team, out in Queens, 8teen

And the girl made in Japan was made for me to hold
When Vincent lent an ear the night the thunder rolled
And the ride we took together was a rodeo
Big dreams, six strings, 8teen

And for everyone born 8teen runnin' wild and free
From the pearly gates of Heaven to the fiery sea
Know that each will teach of passage through the trinity
God's gift runneth 'ore my cup
Call it a blessing or you call it luck
It all adds up to 8teen

And we heard about the letters kept beside his bed
And how he never could forget her or the words she said
That will forever be enshrined and underlined in red
Such sad scenes, so pristine, 8teen

He rode that silver bullet 'cross the borderline
There beneath the maple leaf signed to the Nimbus 9
And the song he hummed that night moves me every time
Fourteen, and so green, 8teen

And for everyone born 8teen runnin' wild and free
From the pearly gates of Heaven to the fiery sea
Know that each will teach of passage through the trinity
God's gift runneth 'ore my cup
Call it a blessing or you call it luck
It all adds up to 8teen

Forever frozen now in time
The night the miracle occurred
They walked on water in my mind

Though we never heard the words

Garth Brooks,"She worked the window at the Desert Sands
Clyde was a dealer who was gifted with the sleight of hand
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Their petty thieving and conniving ways
Would never get 'em to that beach house of their dreams someday
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
But every afternoon at four that armored car rolled to the door (like before)

Bang! Bang!
The doors swing open and the pick-up begins
Bang! Bang!
The guard knocks, she lets him in
Bang! Bang!
Two bangs of cash hit the floor
The guard asks her out, she turns him down and shows him the door (once more)
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

They must have run through it a thousand times
But something happened on the evening of their perfect crime
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

It seems the set up and the switch all play
But there's a problem when it gets down to the get away
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
So, to complete their master plan
They're gonna need a pick-up man (meet Jo-Ann)

Bang! Bang! Bang!

It's four on Monday and the hustle begins
Bang! Bang! Bang!
The guard knocks, she lets him in
Bang! Bang! Bang!
The bags of cash hit the floor
Clyde's hiding out, he swaps 'em out
The guard's out the door (they score)
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!

Two big bags of money and they're both feeling light
She sees the guard is stopping, she knows when something's not right
When he turns to find he's standing face to face now with her
She says ""how 'bout dinner Friday
And if you're good I'll let you have dessert""

Bang! Bang!
The guard is happy and he's gone in a flash
Bang! Bang!
She grabs Clyde and the cash

They were last seen heading West and never heard from again

Then finally he sees the wreck
And says a prayer for whoever they are
Then everything changes the second he sees it's her car

He really loves you
And God knows it's true
And it's something he'd say
And he'd tell you each day

But to some of us guys, you don't realize
How to say it is just not what we do
And it's so hard to see, but take it from me
He really loves you

Down on the shoulder, he's running as fast as he can
Dying to hold her, he's truly a desperate man
And he falls to his knees at the wreck
Up close it all looks so much worse
Same color, same model, but the car in the crash isn't hers

Garth Vader,"Look at my faceâ?¦ I look like I really don't give a fuck. Now days it comes to no surprise, people steppin' up to me and fillin me with all these lies. I give a fuck about, who you know. I do my music just to let myself go because my feelings can't be seen, sometimes ill need be they are real. Trapped behind a mask, but don't ask how I feel. Now I need my deal that revealed the truth and brights. â?¦don't begin to break from hesitating what I create, collaborate what people dedicate. â?¦feelings can't be seen, redeem my self to rest in peace. At least I can release all this preasure, sometimes its hard for me to add an equal measure. Temperature rising, realizing where I was. Ready to die just because, that's what depression does.

[Chorus]
Don't mess with my head, my thoughts are my opinion. Somehow I thought I told you this in the beginning. I speak from my heart and decide we're all pretending. What kinda message do you really think your sending. Somethings I hear come off way too offending. You want to go to battle, then you just end up surrending. I'm so pissed I'm just refueling, this is what I'm thinking, and this is how I'm feeling.

Nothing in this life we live can ever be certain, I'm a muppet on a string, suppose I close the curtain. My prediction, I'm holding tight like constriction. there's too much confliction, now I'm living, fact not bitching. Now I'm wishin, for a complete mission of this life. While they smile in my face, then back-stab me with a knife. Its like two different ways, stuck up in a maze. â?¦goin though the days I need a raise. Good times, don't let it stop. Good things never last. Problems I can't solve, revolve around my past. Life is passing too short, so I support my only goal- have control of my soul before these people play my role. I take a stroll down the brick road, through the dark halls, concrete walls, death calls. I'm scared, but most of them fall. Like nothing at all is seems broken dreams are often so achieve of your belief before you leave up in a coffin.

[Chorus]

My mind is twisted, I miss it. Always filled with rage. These words that I've listed, but myself into the page. I was stuck in a cage, now I'm on the stage, ready to fuck it up I'm blowin up like a 12-guage. At a young age I was blind in my mind. Let myself behind, I can't rewind its time to find, some music and use it to keep me occupied. So many times I tried, all this time I was denied. Decide that I could ride but never would I hide. From my inside self pride I need a guide. So ride on out, and take the right route. But my feelings can't be seen that's what life is all about. So I scream, I shout, to get my point across. But it doesn't really matter, my mind is so lost. I give a fuck about, what ya think. I'm goin crazy and I think I need a shrink.

She had a dream about the King of Sweden,
He gave her things that she was needin',
He gave her a home built of gold and steel,
a diamond car with the platinum wheel.

She had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes,
She sat around and counted them all a million times.

I'll never forget
Was the luckiest of my life
She took me so far
And I broke her heart
Now I'm sittin` here
With the simple truth
That tears me apart

All I had goin` is gone
The best I'll ever do
Is over and done

Just don't understand
He possesses everything life can bring
He thinks there's more
So he has to explore

Nothing's gonna change

Now she pulls him closer as the music slows

I though it was our song but I guess I was wrong
From where I'm sittin` I can see where I stand

She's got her head on his shoulder and her heart in his hands
Thing's are pretty clear when a fool understands

I've never seen her dance like that before
Don't think I can take much of this anymore

Comin' through the door
I can feel it creepin' through the cracks in the floor
Bouncin' off the walls and the ceilin' up above
Since I found you I'm livin' in a house of love

All my life my hear's been walked on
Women said they loved me my how they talked tellin` me lies
And fillin` my eyes with tears that I couldn't control
I couldn't get a hold of myself long enough to realize
They were only tryin` to pull the wool over my eyes
I found you then the skies turned blue
I'm livin` in a house of love

Once I lived in a hole like a rabbit
I couldn't find love the blues were a habit
A lonely man and I couldn't understand
Why everything I tried went wrong

You dried my eyes and truned my night to day

That you and I would meet
We were just strangers

Not a care in the world got to me
But now I lay me down to sleep
I'm afraid of what I might see
I wake up screamin' when your dream goes by

Used to feel like a man in control
Unaware of the storm in my soul
The sight of you took away my breath
I wake up screamin' when your dream goes by

Now in this dream I'm in a room
All dressed up just like a groom
Watchin' shadows dance in the ledge
Suddenly you then appear you whisper in my hear
And I jump right over the edge

Just a dream that I seem to recall
Can't you tell me which doctor to call
Tell him please I'm not feelin too well
Everynight I'm hearin' wedding bells
I wake up screamin' when your dream goes by

I lay there in an ice cold sweat
Sheets are torn and they're soakin' wet
I wake up screamin' when your dream goes by
I wake up screamin' when your dream goes by
I wake up screamin' when your dream goes by

Than to be forgotten, but not gone

On a star-lit Sunday night
When a pick-up truck flew by me out of control
As I watched in my headlights
He swerved left then back right
He never hit the brakes
As he left the road

I found him lying in the grass
Among the steel and glass
With an empty whiskey bottle by his side
And through the blood and tears
He whispered in my ear
A few last words just before he died

Don't tell Mama I was drinkin'
Lord knows her soul would never rest
I can't leave this world with Mama thinkin'
I met the Lord with whiskey on my breath

I still think about that night
And how that young man died
And how others sometimes pay for our mistakes
The last thing on his mind
As he left this world behind
Was knowing someone else's heart would break

Cause I've never felt one so right
Each look into your eyes I fall in,

Two shadows dancing on the wall

With nothing on but the radio,
Feel the music playing soft and slow,
You and me and the lights down low,
With nothing on but the radio

We'll fall asleep here in the moonlight,
In tangled sheets we?ll be here all night,
And when we wake up in the morning,
We might stay like this all day,
Two people meant to be together,
Two lovers dreaming of forever,
And it just keeps on getting better,
With every tender little kiss

I saw him walking by your side,

Go on and show him he's the one,
Go on and give him every sacred thing that you used to save for us,

Look at the tears falling in this heart baby,
Go on go on go on,

Softly in my ear,
I lay awake and I remember the way it felt to hold you near,
Go on and run your fingers through his hair,
Go on and lay by his side,
Go on and wrap him in your dark surrender,
And all your tender lies,

And the money,
And the good times,

On an old honky tonker's heart,

And there's nothin' to do
So I'm drivin' around in circles and I'm thinkin' about you
Today I heard you got a new last name,
Sure didn't know it was gonna hit me this way
And the radio just keeps playin' all this songs about rain
(Rainy night in Georgia, Kentucky rain)

Now there's all kinda songs about babies and love that goes right,
But for some unknown reason nobody wants to play them tonight,
Hey I hope it's sunny wherever you are,
But that's sure not the picture tonight in my car,
And it sure ain't easin' my pain all these songs like

Here comes that rainy day feelin' again,
Blue eyes cryin' in the early mornin' rain,
They go on and on and there's no two the same,
Oh it would be easy to blame all these songs about rain

Well I thought I was over you
But I guess maybe I'm not,
'Cause when I let you go looks like lonely is all that I got,
Guess I'll never know what could have been,
Sure ain't helpin' this mood that I'm in,

Backed down from a punch
Well I'd take it square on the chin

Could totally terrify me

My wife would just laugh
She'd say ""I know all about men
How when tough little boys grow up to be dads
They turn into big babies again""

And I'm gonna stand there and smile

Into a grey sky morning
Now I'm here to stay
Love can be so boring

Nothing's quite the same now
I just say your name now

But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You don't want me back
You're just the best I ever had

So you stole my world
Now I'm just a phony
Remembering the girl
Leaves me down and lonely

Send it in a letter
Make yourself feel better

But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You don't want me back
You're just the best I ever had

And it may take some time to
Patch me up inside
But I can't take it so I
Run away and hide
And I may find in time that
You were always right
You're always right

So you sailed away
Into a grey sky morning
Now I'm here to stay

Johnny Cash came to his crossroad in a place called Nickajack Cave.

Little white pills and whiskey
Honky tonks and smoke
One night stands with his country band
Had him strung out on the ropes
Well, he cried out to Jesus
He said, ""Jesus, I think I'm too lost to save.""
He already had one foot inside the grave
As he stepped into the mouth of Nickajack Cave

Everything was darkness
Wasn't no light at all
Just the cold dank air and the pitch black dirt
And the spiders on the walls
Well, he laid down beneath a ledge
And curled up there to meet his judgment day
The shivering came upon him wave by wave
Well, he could feel the breath of death in Nickajack Cave

Then high above him shone a light
He never would forget
Then he heard a voice say, ""Johnny Cash,
I ain't through with you yet.
Get up, I ain't through with you yet.
I ain't through with you get Johnny Cash,
Get up.""

Then he crawled out from beneath that ledge
And felt a gentle breeze
Tears and dirt smeared on his face
As peaceful as could be
Well, he knelt down upon the ground
Raised his eyes up to the light and prayed
He said, ""Lord, I'll be your servant from this day.""

Gary Allan,"Half of my mistakes I made stone cold sober
Half of my mistakes I've made at closing time
Half the time I never saw it coming, until it was over
Oh, and half of my mistakes I've made with love the line

Half of them where made 'cause my heart was moving too slow

At a caramel colored sunset sky
Checking my watch doing the math in my head
Counting back words to when you said goodbye
Well those runway lights are getting brighter

I'm just sitting out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Trying to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore
Right now I'm sitting out here watching airplanes

I would've lied could've cried should've tried harder
Done anything to make you stay
I wonder what you'd do if you looked out your window
Saw me running down the runway just like I was crazy
That fence is too high so am I

So I'm just sitting out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Trying to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore
By now I know you're thirty thousand feet above me
But a million miles away, a million miles away
By now I know I ought to act like you don't love me

I'm just sitting out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Trying to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore
Right now I'm sitting out here watching airplanes

Put a ring around her finger

I should be happy for her today
So tell me why are these tears in my eyes?
I know I should be happy for her
But I've lost everything
I've lost everything I've ever wanted today

Today, I thought about the moment I could have said I loved her
And promised her forever together
Today, today it really hit me
That she don't really miss me
She's found a new beginning
And I'm wishing I had one more chance

I had an old guitar that wouldn’t stay in tune
But now it sounds just fine since I’ve met you
I’m good as new

I had some crazy thoughts runnin’ through my brain
Wonderin’ if my life was goin’ down the drain
I had a broken heart, broken right in two
But now it’s in one piece since I’ve met you
I’m good as new

You made my life like a lullaby
You put the spark back into my eyes
You put the shine in the shining sea
And you hung the moon where it should be

Now my old yard is looking nice and green
And my old car, well, it’s a clean machine
Even my old dog, she can feel it too
It’s not the same old thing since I’ve met you
I’m good as new

Since I’ve met you
Well, I’m good as new
Since I’ve met you
I’m good as new",Good as New
Gary Allan,"I stayed as drunk as I could
For longer than I should
Off ruby-red lips and soft fingertips
And her long blonde hair
Was flowing everywhere
Like a red, red wine
And its stoned my mind

What goes up must come down
It was a hard lesson learned
That was then, this is now

Don’t get too high on love
Or addicted to her touch
Don’t get hung up on forever
'Cause there ain't no such
Don't get strung out on a woman
‘Cause comin’ down is the hardest part
When she walks away and leaves you
With a hungover heart

Oh, I’ve tried to sober up
But I’m jonesin’ way too much
For one more kiss
Mmm, that heavenly bliss
And the longer that I’m dry
Takes me further back in time
When I was her man
Ooo, when I was her man

Losin’ her is gonna be the death of me
I can’t drown her memory out
With Tennessee whiskey

Don’t get too high on love
Or addicted to her touch
Don’t get hung up on forever
'Cause there ain't no such
Don't get strung out on a woman
‘Cause comin’ down is the hardest part
When she walks away and leaves you
With a hungover heart

Don’t get too high on love
Or addicted to her touch
Don’t get hung up on forever
'Cause there ain't no such
Don't get strung out on a woman
‘Cause comin’ down is the hardest part
When she walks away and leaves you
With a hungover heart

Ooo, hungover heart
She’ll leave you with a hungover heart",Hungover Heart
Gary Allan,"I stood there in the middle of the church of the broken people.
Listened to the walking wounded tell their stories.
My turn came I told 'em my name. I said this ain't my first time.
Then a man started talking how the devil and the bottle was ruining my life.
With last night on my breath
I stood up and said

It ain't the whiskey.
It ain't the cigarettes.
It ain't the stuff I smoke.
It's all these things I can't forget.
It ain't the hard times.
It ain't the all nights.
It ain't that easy,
It ain't the whiskey
That's killin' me.

So what do you got for this empty spot inside of me?
The deep dark hole where love used to be.
Before she ripped it out and ran into the arms of someone else.
Y'all sit in this room and you talk like you got some kind of remedy.
Well I hear what you're telling me,
But I've got all the proof I need.

It ain't the whiskey.
It ain't the cigarettes.
It ain't the stuff I smoke.
It's all these things I can't forget.
It ain't the hard times.
It ain't the all nights.
Oh it ain't that easy,
'Cause it ain't the whiskey
That's killin' me.

I've done everything to drown this hurt inside,
But I can't wash you off of my mind.

It ain't the whiskey.
It ain't the cigarettes.
It ain't the stuff I smoke.
It's all these things I can't forget,
It ain't the hard times.

Standin’ there at the pearly gates

Messed up more than a time or two
I’ve lived like hell, I’ve done it well
And I’ve got the scars to prove
When I show up alone at heaven’s door
Will I be proud of what I’ve done
Or will I be begging for

It was all me, it was all me

Sun down here just feels a little hotter
Burnin’ away today ’cause I ain’t got her no more, no more
Somethin’ kinda dark about stone white beaches
Nobody here practice what they preaches
The truth is, the truth ain’t worth what I’m reaching for
In the distance I hear tequila talk
And college chicks in the parking lot
While I just lay here starin’ up at God

With sand in my soul
Beer in my veins
Lettin’ my hair grow in room 108
Gettin’ over you, I ain’t even gonna try
'Cause I’m on a roll
Fillin’ up this hole
With sand in my soul

Headphones, shades, never gettin’ rattled
Spent all day just building you a castle
It’s okay if you're back in the saddle at home, back home
I hate to say I’m glad you broke my heart
And I hate to say it isn’t tearing me apart
But I love the way this tiki bar is somehow never closed

Must’ve drove her memory across at least ten state lines

I’ve never seen you look so happy
You never looked so good in love

I fought the fear and chased the pain

I chose to walk the line as one
Sometimes, as I live upon my island
Cut off from emotion and its pain
Oh, that's when I'm tempted by the waters
The waters that I can take me far away

So I'll just keep on walking down this open road
Hoping someone somewhere needs me
So I'll just keep on walking down this open road
Talking to the man who knows me
Yes he knows me, the man is me

My life was once full of people's faces
Brought to me by love which isn't strange
Oh my life had the goodness of blue waters
A day's a day for all I used to say
Sometimes I can sit and cry my heart out
Drowning in my autocratic ways
Oh, that's when I am tempted by the waters
Waters that can take me far away
So I'll just keep on walking down this open road
Hoping someone somewhere needs me
So I'll just keep on walking down this open road
Talking to the man who knows me
Yes he knows me, the man is me

My life is now full of people's faces
Within the light of change I pulled away
Oh, my life shows that no man is a island
I've exchanged the piece of life I cut away
Now you won't see me walking down that open road
I've found someone now who needs me
No you won't see me walking down that open road

Never knew that pain could survive here inside
Never knew that I'd miss you this much

Making last night feel like a vision of things yet to come
You just had to hold me like nobody else

You had to love me

When it rings it's never the voice you needed to hear

But hope you'll never sleep when we're apart 
All that I've given, given away, 
Is all that I need here tonight 
All that I try to, try to forget

It fights for all that I've given away 
The day it never goes too fast when you needed it to pass 
Every corner of the night loneliness sleeps 
And though I'll never hear the answers 
To the questions that I've had asked 
I often wonder what our future could have been 
(What our future could have been) 
This deep regret makes it harder to accept 
With love I payed the price from the heart 
All that I've given, given away, 
Is all that I need here tonight 
All that I try to, try to forget, 
Is the more this empty heart seems to fight 
It fights for all that I've given away

Gary Barlow,"Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now I'm found;
Was blind, but now I see.

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fear relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares,
We have already come.
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far,
And grace will lead us home.

When we've been here ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun.
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun.",Amazing Grace
Gary Barlow,"Some words they can’t be spoken only sung,
So hear a thousand voices shouting love.
There’s a place, there’s a time in this life
When you sing what you are feeling,
Find your feet, stand your ground,
Don’t you see right now the world is listening to what we say?

Sing it louder, sing it clearer, knowing everyone will hear you,
Make some noise, find your voice tonight.
Sing it stronger, sing together, make this moment last forever,
Old and young shouting love tonight.

To sing we’ve had a lifetime to wait (wait, lifetime to wait)
And see a thousand faces celebrate (celebrate, faces celebrate)
You brought hope, you brought life,
Conquered fear, no it wasn’t always easy,
Stood your ground, kept your faith,
Don’t you see right now the world is listening to what we say?

Sing it louder, sing it clearer, knowing everyone will hear you,
Make some noise, find your voice tonight.
Sing it stronger, sing together, make this moment last forever,
Old and young shouting love tonight.

Some words they can’t be spoken only sung,

To have, but never hold
It’s a life alone, and a desperate need
To be held to be loved so
This is gonna take a bit of getting used to,
But I know what’s right for you

Fly high and let me go
That sky will save your soul
When you pass by then you’ll know
That this gonna take a bit of getting used to
But I know what’s right for you
Let me go

A head full of madness
And no where safe
When tears aren’t big enough,
And love turns into hate
It’s a life alone, and a desperate need
To be held to be loved so
This gonna take a bit of getting used to
But I know what’s right for you

Fly high and let me go
That sky will save your soul
When you pass by then you’ll know
That this gonna take a bit of getting used to
But I know what’s right for you

So let me go life will get better
Find the love I never gave ya
I know you lie there waiting all night long,
So find where you belong

Fly high and let me go (Let me go)
That sky will save your soul (Let it save your soul tonight)
Fly high and let me go (Let me go let me go)
That sky will save your soul
But this gonna take a bit of getting used to

What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be

With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there 
She would merengue and do the cha-cha 
And while she tried to be a star 
Tony always tended bar 
Across the crowded floor, they worked from 8 til 4 
They were young and they had each other 
Who could ask for more?

The hottest spot north of Havana (here) 
At the copa (CO!) Copacabana 
Music and passion were always in fashion 
At the copa they fell in love 

His name was Rico 
He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola, 
Still in dress she used to wear, 
Faded feathers in her hair

There was no more fear of flying
Once the final word were spoke
There was no more tears of crying
It had all become a joke
Though they took a vow of silence
Still the rumours quickly spread
There was no more point in trying
For the great affair was dead
There was no more fear of flying
There was no more fears and pain
There was no more need for spying
They had everything to gain
There was no more fear of flying
There was no more tortured brow
They had dropped the safety curtain
They had killed the sacred cow
There was everything to live for
There was nothing to explain
They had left the scene, triumphant
They would live to fight again

When it's time for me to go
And I hear that whistle blow
I'll be waiting in line day or night
Take my hand and lead me down
Lay my burden on the ground
Break these chains and let me stand in the light
Now I know what the game's all about
If that's the way you want to play - count me out
Had enough of alibis, empty promises and lies
Trying to find a better life on my own
There's no easy way I know - now the strains begin to show
Still I'm looking for a light to lead me home
Though my heart's still full of doubt -
There's no way I'm gonna play - so count me out
I've been too long here breaking my back
Doing my best to get through
I never thought I could feel this way
But I need to find something new
It's not the money and it's not the gold
- I just want some peace of mind
My life is racing like a runaway train
Getting faster all the time...
Underneath a golden sky
Far away I'm gonna fly
To a place I know is there in my mind
Like a sailor home to die
With no journey left to try
Throw my spirit in the tide and lead me blind

Gary Burton,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Bell

It splits the day apart
Into time well spent and time just thrown away
I wish my heart would please make up my mind
I'm wasting so much time
Gotta catch a glimpse of how it's gonna be

When finally I look inside Your eyes and see
Reflections of Yourself in me
The way You always said it would be
When finally, I'm loving You like You love me
It happened oh, so easily
I looked at You and it came to me finally

The day to day just keeps on spinning round
But this one thing I have found
I can close my eyes and be there in Your arms
You take me to a place that's safe and warm
You're my harbor in the storm
Wanna lose myself in being there with You

When finally I look inside Your eyes and see
Reflections of Yourself in me
The way You always said it would be
When finally, I'm loving You like You love me

There's hope for us if you can just

Give me tomorrow and another chance
To tear down this wall that keeps us so far apart
Let me borrow another day
To show what my heart's made of
Can you give me tomorrow to love?

Sweet reflections of you and me

And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy

Mary did you know that your baby boy will calm a storm with his hand?
Did you know that your baby boy has walked where angels trod?
And when your kiss your little baby, you have kissed the face of God

The lame will leap, the dumb will speak, the praises of the lamb

Expecting the whole world to seek out and find us
Jesus is making us people who care and if we will be willing to share

Gary Clark Jr.,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

I go out walking after midnight
Along the lonely thoroughfare
It's not the time or place to look for you
But maybe you'll be there

You said your arms would always hold me
You said your lips were mine alone to kiss
Now after all those things you told me
How can it end like this?

Some day if all my prayers are answered
I'll hear a footstep on the stair
With anxious heart I'll hurry to the door
And maybe you'll be there

Give me something for my peace of mind;
There must be a simple explanation
How can anybody throw away a love like mine:

Maybe you don't see what you require
Don't my kind of action turn you on;

Gary Glitter,"A long the Grooviest Street in town
You're trendy friend of Mine
Stepping out to show your face

Walking up and walking down
Just can't wait to get in line
Just make sure you're in the right place

Sidewalk Sinner
Think you're such a winner
Ev'ry body knows your Name (Game, Name)

All you want is admiration, Showing off your new creation
Think you're full of fascination, Must improve your situation,
Flattery is not my style, I'll let you off the hook a while

Get your action, get your friends
You'll soon come back to me again,

Sidewalk Sinner, think you're such a winner

Gary Glitter,"Darling, please don't leave me now
I need you more than ever
Don't be sad
Don't let me see you cry
I'll love you
Love you forever
Think of me when you are far away
Think of me at least once ev'ry day

I say goodbye, my love, goodbye, my love
Till we meet once again
Yes, it's goodbye my love goodbye, my love
Say it's not the end

Standing here in the departure longue
It's growing deep inside me
Wonder when
I'll see the love I found
Hoping that we were always meant to be
A million miles is just a breath away
A million miles is just some words we say

And it's goodbye, my love

Now they're calling, it's time for you to go
One more kiss before you're leaving
Now you're boarding as they close the doors
I hear the engines softly screaming

They say goodbye, my love",Goodbye My Love
Gary Go,"I look in my crystal ball
And see nothing
I quietly wish I had it all
Or at least something

While the short waves
Sends chaos around us
I don't hear a thing
It's all so quiet in Brooklyn

If I had a fresh start
I'd probably fail
So I drink my coffee
And open the mail

Now I hope the cruel words
In your letter
Are baptized by my tears
I would try to make it all better
But it would take years

Cause while I've been feeding your ego
Mine's been wearing thin
It's all so quiet in Brooklyn

I'd get lost anywhere
As long as I'm found
I could be anyone in any town

Why is there no one to help me
Find my way through
Cause if there was someone to help me
Maybe I could help you

Seems everyone's already started
While I don't know where to begin

I don't know why we're fighting
When we're on the same side
Stop here we're stalling
I cant keep looking backwards
Gotta live for now not then

Oh this is where the penny drops
We only seem to look for it when its lost
Oh there were times we made the traffic stop
But now the bright lights don't notice us at all
Oh Lift the weights lets not waste time
With the little things that stop us moving

Stop here we're stalling

Gotta live for now not then

My happy memory is home
Back when the engines started on their own
Lost in so many different places
So many conversations
Faces I don't wanna face
Without your love in my life
I don't know where were going
But I cant wait to arrive

Cause your love is my life
I don't know why were fighting
When we're on the same side
Stop here were stalling

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing

Like the kicker in a julep or two

Can't you see that it never can be?

And the water's as cold as the snow
The man is chasing behind me
And I can't afford to falter or slow
I find solace in what we believe 
Or the hush of a cool gentle rain
But there's something we love in the mystery
Of a man in the midst of a change

She laughed and said I was going nowhere
'Cause it's nowhere that she's ever been
When I get to that place she'll remember my face
And say ""Hey man, I knew him when he was younger""
But she never loved me at all
She laughed when I was in pain
'Cause there's something that we are all frightened of
In the man in the midst of a change

Out on the roof to inquire of the sky
The existence of ghosts in my life
Who's to blame you or I?
No one would answer me
They just stared with the weight of the world I pretend not to feel

The windmill is poised for the battle 
But the fool understands not the game
He believes in his mission, predestined position
Amazing the grace of her name
Oh he loves her now as he loved her then
Rocinante remembers the days
When I whistled and sat waiting patiently
With the man in the midst of a change

Running along the rocks of the river
With the freedom to step where I choose
Though I can't stop to rest I like traveling best
And besides, I've got nothing to lose from it
I find solace in all the extremes
In pleasure as well as in pain
I just wish he would let me explain to you

Gary Moore,"They came for him one winter's night.
Arrested, he was bound.
They said there'd been a robbery,
his pistol had been found.
They marched him to the station house,
he waited till the dawn.
And as they led him to the dock,
he knew that he'd been wronged.
""You stand accused of robbery,""
he heard the bailiff say.
He knew without an alibi,
tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom.
Over the hills and far away,
for ten long years he'll count the days.
Over the mountains and the seas,
a prisoner's life for him there'll be.
He knew that it would cost him dear,
but yet he dare not say.
Just where he'd been that fateful night,
a secret it must stay.
He had to fight back tears of rage.
His heart beat like a drum.
For with the wife of his best friend,
he spent his final night of freedom.
Over the hills and far away,
he swears he will return one day.
Far from the mountains and the seas,
back in her arms again he'll be.
Over the hills and far away.
Over the hills and,
over the hills and,
over the hills and far away.
Each night within his prison cell,
he looks out through the bars.
He reads the letters that she wrote.
One day he'll know the taste of freedom.
Over the hills and far away,
she prays he will return one day.
As sure as the rivers reach the seas,
back in his arms again she'll be.
Over the hills and far away,
he swears he will return one day.
As sure as the river reach the seas,
back in his arms is where she'll be.
Over the hills and far away,

Gary Moore,"They looked out from the fortress on the hill.
There came a single warrior returning from the kill.
The spoils of war hung from his horses mane.
The bloody heads of enemies that he had freshly slayed.
They saw the face, the eyes so sullen,
could only be the young Cúchulain.
Thunder rising, thunder rising,
thunder rising early in the morning.
Cities burning,
the world keeps turning.
Thunder rising early in the morning.
The son of Lugh MacEithleen knew no fear.
For just one blow at any foe to tell his end was near.
So many tried to mock this Celtic son.
They taunted and they teased him till
he slayed them one by one.
And so they came, and so they've fallen
at the hands of young Cúchulain.
Thunder rising, thunder rising,
thunder rising early in the morning.
Cities burning,
the world keeps turning.
Thunder rising early in the morning.
Long ago the legend has it,
how the mighty Ulster men
battled with the King Of Connacht,
fighting to the bitter end.
No one knew what foolish reason
caused this skirmish to begin.
Was it treachery or treason,
or just the idle threats of drunken men?
Thunder rising, thunder rising,
thunder rising early in the morning.
Cities burning,
the world keeps turning.
Thunder rising early in the morning.
Thunder rising, thunder rising,
thunder rising early in the morning.
Young men are dying,
the widows are crying.

It's the darkest hour of the darkest night
It's a million miles from the morning light
Can't get no sleep, don't know what to do
I've got those midnight blues
When the shadows fall, I feel the night closing in
There must be some reason for this mood I'm getting in
Can't get no sleep, don't know what to do
I've got those midnight blues
Every evening after sundown
As the light begins to fade
I feel so low, but I just don't know
Why these blues won't go away

And I've heard that the grass is greener
On the other side of the hill

That's why I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on
I've been hangin' around too long
It's time I was movin' on
Give me one more for the go

I'm gonna leave this town tomorrow
I'm gonna leave this place behind
You can bet your bottom dollar
All my troubles will be far behind

That's why I'm movin' on

But I found out the hard way,

But even then as now women were a weakness of mine 
In grade school I was a mess 
Pullin' up some little girl's dress 

Teacher would send me home from school what a witch! 
Mama'd say ""Bad boy, go get me that switch"" 

Chorus: 
Mama you cant' give me no whippin'  
Just for stayin' out all night 
Mama you can't give me no whippin'  
I'm old enough to know wrong from right 
Mama you can't turn me over your knee 
It's embarrassing to a man like me 
Mamma I think I've got something that the girls like 
Mama I think I might have something that the girls like 

I guess I was 'bout thirteen when this feeling came over me 
I started learnin' how to talk the girls out of their virginity 
Sneak 'em out into the light of the moon 
Sneak 'em up into my bedroom 
Mama'd catch us without a stitch and say 
""Bad boy now get me that switch"" 

I remember celebratin' my eighteenth birthday 
I headed out into the evening and I heard Mama say 
""Boy don't cha be late"" 
I rolled in about 4 AM 
Didn't know where I was or were I'd been 
There was Mama with a belt in her hand 
And I said ""Hey! Mama your boy's a man!!""

Gary Morris,"Once was a woman and once was a man
Who'd never been lovers, just good friends
Both of them happy with rings on their hands
But they'd dreamed of each other, romance

So picture two people alone in a room
Together for the very first time
Candles are burning, holding each other

And picture two people whose dreams have come true
They must be goin' out of their minds
If for only a moment seems like forever

Finishing touches
The canvas set to dry
Each color tells its story
Of where and when and why

Now no one can know what a love is to life
Till they have to choose one, lose one
And no one can know what a heartache is like
Till they have to break one, take one

Each color tells its story
Of where and when and why

Now, there is a woman and there is a man
Who used to be good friends, now they're just lovers
Their dreams of forever must come to an end
And stop all this madness, somehow recover

So picture two people alone in a room
Who finally have made up their minds
Oh, how the tears flow, both know

And picture them holdin' each other real tight
Knowing it's the very last time
They gotta let go, let go

For so long now
I could never turn my back on you
And just walk out

How could I leave you
When you've been so forgiving?
But living without her love
Don't feel like much like living

Caught between two fires
One is safe and warm
One is pure desire
As the flames raise higher

Either way I turn
I'm gonna get burned
Caught between two fires

Lyin' close beside you
After the love we've made
Another face flickers in my mind
And takes me miles away

I've tried so hard to fight it
But I can't fight anymore
My heart is so divided girl
In this tug of war

Caught between two fires
One is safe and warm
One is pure desire

And free to love again
Then part of me lets go of you

Sometimes I think I'll never be
Really over you

Dreams die hard
When they don't come true
Dreams die hard
And there's nothing you can do

Dreams die hard
When they take your pride
It's hard to find a new dream
With an old one in your eyes

Sometimes I go a day or two
You don't even cross my mind
I think maybe it's finally true
Gonna leave the past behind

Then I see someone who looks like you
From a window on the street
I know it's not really you
But my heart still skips a beat

When they don't come true

Lose the look, you're painted on disguise
Lose the dress, that hides the fairest prize

Lose the time, this time belongs to me
Lose your mind and let the moments be
Lose your all, you're all I'll ever need

On the outside a plain brown wrapper
On the inside solid gold
But the inside's all that matters
And the outside's just for show

Soon the years will surely fade away
Soon the time with lines and shades of gray
Soon the dreams will all be yesterdays

If all that's left is what we're feeling now
All that's changed won't matter anyhow
Rearranged, it's still the same somehow

When the outside's a plain brown wrapper
Still the inside's solid gold
But the inside's all that matters
And the outside was just for show

Hoping to hear a few
Simple words to believe

And one honest touch is more than enough
For someone with no one to love

Does anybody out there want
A second hand heart
One that's already broken in?
I think I made it through the hardest part
At least enough to try love again

There's a raging fire in me
A perfect match can start
If anybody out there wants

Till someone belongs in my dreams

Gary Motley,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

Gary Motley,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon

Right through the very heart of it

I wanna wake up in a city that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap

If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere

And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain

Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's

Gary Motley,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

Just you and I, 
Forever and a day
Love will not die,

Sweet and lovely, heaven must have sent her my way.
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes; 
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise?

When she nestles in my arms so tenderly, 
There's a thrill that words cannot express.
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody haunting me.
Sweet and lovely, sweeter than the roses in May, 
And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say.",Sweet and Lovely

Gary Numan,"Only a downstat
Personality problem
He would say things like 'I love you'
And cry real tears

Met him in some place
Like a home for old mothers
Where the cure is always death
But no-one ever leaves

He wore a number 7
Badge on his collar
He would show it with pride
And say 'it means I can feel'

He'd bribe the warders
To send letters to someone
Who didn't even know his name
But said she'd read them anyway

And in the evening (??)
He writes poetry for people
Who deny he's alive
And say 'I'll mention that name'

A violator of the law of no feelings
They should be put in the chair
Until their eyes come in (??)

If you have reasons
I might sell you my time
I'll leave it under the stairs
In a body of mine

Old memories are slowly fading out of me
We are the unknowns, we are all you need

Personality malfunction
He says I can't give you anything at all

But I can't think of anything to do
He's addicted to the time track

With people that I don't know

At least until the lights go out
