Loudness,"You cry, darkness listens
You hide, sudden sorrow
Black and blue
When fever builds inside you

Your body shivers hot and cold at night
Hold on tight
You know the power's out
You can't leave

Now that your heart is pounding, energy
Shattered, afraid to show it
Don't let the crazy madness pull you in
Fight to win

Looks like your life is crashing
You're on the razor's edge
It's hard to know
Don't let go

The night is blowing cold
You can't leave
Twisted by silence and the agony
Lines are down everywhere

Something's under the stair
Lines are down
The razor's edge
Cry for me

You cry darkness listens
You hide, sudden sorrow fights at you
Break on through
Lights out, someone's watching

Lookin' for the images to cut and run
Load your gun
One shot, squeeze the trigger
Make them leave
Left in the night, the only enemy",The Lines Are Down
Loudness,"Got a new hair style I see
And you're dressed to kill
Bright coloured lipstick for me
But against my will

Please don't go changin'
You're gonna change your mind
Please never change your mind
I look at you, head to toe

But it don't seem right
All this fashion for show
Happened overnight
I've got your number

It's only changin' times
Please never change your mind
Hear me when I'm sayin'
How my love grows

Given time and a chance, you'll see
Things are always cahngin'
That's how love goes
Don't go changin' a thing for me",Never Change Your Mind
Loudness,"Lost in the underground
Lookin' for daylight
Afraid darkness
And surrounded by the light

Screaming I shout
There's no way out
You said goodby so cold
I stood in wonder

Shocked by the silence
Shaken by the thunder
Screaming I shout
There's no way out

I ask questions and you tell me lies
Try to make you but I'm hypnotized
Am I over you? I got my doubts
I try everything, there's no way out

I walk the streets at night
I hear your laughter
The voices in my head
They don't mind, I don't matter

Screaming I shout
There's no way out
Watching the hours crack
Still have that feelin'

Darkness attacks the wall
I hit the ceiling
Screaming I shout
There's no way out
[* Repeat]
** You got your vain excuses
I got my anger
One fight, guess who loses
That's what tortures me
[*, ** Repeat]
There's no way out!",No Way Out
Loudness,"* I got your real love, baby
I got everything on my side
I got your real love, baby
I want to keep you satisfied
** Can't you see I'm so true
I'm crazy for you
So spend your life with me
That's all you can do
* We could be together
We could be together
I want your real love, baby
I'll get you everything that you need
I want your real love, baby
I'll try to keep you satisfied

I don't want to hurt you
You don't need the pain
Don't you know that I need to
Love you again",We Could Be Together
Loudness,"Fading light, broken hearts, I left
Them all behind
Turned to stone, I choose to roam
The wild world
Broken dreams, pools of tears,
Nothing do they mean
Came the night, to pay the price
Of love

(Chorus)
I see the faces in the fire, still
Burning
I feel the hunger of the flame,
Reaching to me

I see the faces in the fire, I'm
Learning
I'm just a fool in Paradise, (in
love) and I'll never get free

I turned away so long ago,
Looking for the change
My promises, they rode upon the
Wind
Came the night the air was cold,
With a flood of memories
Coming back to haunt my empty
Soul",Face to Face
Loudness,"Driving to the top of the city,
Drive until I reach the view,
Where we used to try and see,
Our dream come true,

Stop the car, light a cigarette,
Fill the air with the radio,
And there's nothing I can do,
But think of you,

I was the one who talked about the other man,
I thought he was my friend, but you had other plans,
I just can't take that chance,
There ain't no looking back,
Just a victim of circumstance,
I helped you fall in love so,

Let it go!
Let it go! (Let it go!)
Let it go!
Let it go!
Let it go!

When I dial your telephone number,
It's like I'm never home,
But I know it isn't true,
What's he doing with you?

I don't like to sleep alone, no

Doesn't seem to bother you,
As long as you are having fun,
You don't care what you do,

I was the one who talked about the other man,
I thought he was my friend, but you had other plans,
It's all gone by so fast,
There ain't no looking back,
Just a victim of circumstance,
I helped you fall in love so,

Let it go! (Let it go!)

Loudness,"So far away 
You've been gone all the while
I'm feeling lonely like a homeless child
This clown pretends
Everything's all right
While his heart is breakin' inside

So lonely, so lonely for you
Oh baby, Oh baby
I'm so lonely
What can I do
I'm trapped
I'm livin' without you

You're all that I have
I can't leave you behind
The touch of your love
Oh it burns me inside
I should break away
But I've nowhere to run
I'm trapped
I'm livin' without you

Love gone wrong
Love gone blind
Tears may flow
Till the end of time
Can't let go 
To what I left behind
I've awaited too long

Loudness,"Gimme shelter, cold was the night,
Fires burn deep in the sky.
I been trying so hard just to weather
The storm in your eyes
Stranger, fire and ice, diamonds that glow in the dark
You look, but don't touch, oh I wanna so much
She says burn.

Take no prisoner, steal your soul
Give you no quarter, and never let go
All through the night, she's tempting your fate
She gives you no choice, you can't hesitate

Running for cover, do it or die

So cold like the steel on a blade
Cutting straight through my heart.

You started something 
Or maybe you tried 
But you had it coming 
And I got you under my thumb 
Starting something 
I'll settle the score 
I'm owing nothing 
I'm out the door 

You've got her on her knees and you know

Loudon Wainwright III,"We've come a long way since we last shook hands
Still got a long way to go
We couldn't see the flowers since we last shook hands
Couldn't see the flowers on account of the snow
What did you do with your burden and your cross
Did you carry it yourself or did you crack
You and I know that a burden and a cross
Can only be carried on one man's back
All my life I wanted to roam
To go to the ends of the earth
But the earth really ends where you started to roam
You and I know what a circle is worth
Let's drink a cup to what went down
There's not much left to reveal
I think I changed my mind after what went down
As to who in the end got the better deal
Give me your hand for the parting touch
Fare thee well and thanks a lot
I know that we promised we would keep in touch
But you and I know that we both forgot
We've come a long way since we last shook hands
Still got a long way to go
Couldn't see the flowers when we last shook hands

""Who's in charge, now?"" I don't know, take your pick.

Things are looking kind of gray, like they're going to black

Don't turn on the TV, don't show me the paper

I want to go on vacation till the pressure lets up

How much is it all worth?
It's getting harder to understand it

When it rains it pours out of a poisonous sky
In California the body counts keep getting higher
It's evil out there, man that state is always on fire.

Even Bob Geldof looks alarmingly thin
I got to get on that shuttle get me out of this place
But there's gonna be warfare up there in outer space

I've got clothes on my back and shoes on my feet
A roof over my head and something to eat
My kids are all healthy and my folks are alive
You know, it's amazing but sometimes I think I'll survive

I've got all of my fingers and all of my toes
I'm pretty well off I guess, I suppose
So how come I feel bad so much of the time?
A man ain't an island John Dunn wasn't lying

[Chorus]

It's business as usual; some things never change
It's unfair, it's tough, unkind and it's strange
We don't seem to learn; we can't seem to stop
Maybe some explosions would close up the shop

You know, maybe that would be fine: we would be off the hook
We resolved all our problems, never mind what it took
And it all would be over, finito, the end
Until the survivors started up all over again

Loudon Wainwright III,"Little did I know, though I probably should have guessed
By the way you walked and talked and spoke and smoked an dressed
You actually seemed to like me and so naturally I presumed
You were after that thing, it's the one thing, it's assumed

So I wined and dined you, hey, I love that kind of stuff
And we blabbed about our backgrounds, how family life is rough
We spoke of what we dreamed of, what we thought of, what we did
Midway through the second bottle I admitted I had kids

But nothing seemed to throw you though I know you better now
At the time my minor crime was figuring out how
To get you in my hotel room unclothed and in my bed
And proceed with the unspeakable, it's better left unsaid

We went to see a friend of your and watch me on TV 
Sheer coincidence you said, synchronicity
A full moon on a Friday night, the thirteenth of July
A man and two women in a room and on the screen the guy

Your friend, she liked me on the show, yeah she was snowed for sure
Her body language got obscene, her demeanor less than pure
You started venting something wearing spleen upon your sleeve
You got sort of nervous, kind of anxious, had to leave

You told me on the freeway that you didn't sleep with men
I put two and two togetherâ?¦and I asked about your friend
It turns out she    and though she loved my show
She too preferred the fairer sexâ??I absorbed the blow

It turns out that you did like men but didn't like their things
That hang down and all the hang-ups being with them always brings
My brother is so practical; this is what he said:
""You should have asked if it was cool to watch them both in bed""",Synchronicity

Loudon Wainwright III,"When a ship is sinking and they lower the lifeboats
And hand out the life jackets, the men keep on their coats
The women and the children are the ones who must go first
And the men who try to save their skins are cowards and are cursed

Every man's a captain, men know how to drown
Man the lifeboats if there's room, otherwise go down

And it's the same when there's a war on: it's the men who go to fight
Women and children are civilians, when they're killed it's not right
Men kill men in uniform, its the way war goes
When they run they're cowards, when they stay they are heroes

Every man's a general, men go off to war
The battlefields a man's world, cannon fodders what they're for

It's the men who have the power, it's the men who have the might
And the world's a place of horror because each man thinks he's right
A man's home is his castle so the family let him in
But what's important in that kingdom is the women and the children

Loudon Wainwright III,"There are pictures on the piano,
Pictures of the family,
Mostly my kids but there's an old
Picture of you and me.
You were five and I was six
In 1952
That was forty years ago
How could it be true?

We were sitting outside drawing
At a table meant for cards,
And it must have been in autumn,
Falling leaves in the front yard,
With a shoe box full of crayons,
Full of colors oh so bright,
In a picture in a plastic frame,
A snapshot black and white.

You were looking at my paper,
Watching what I drew
It was natural: I was older,
Thirteen months more than you.
A brother and a sister,
A little boy and girl,
And whoever took that picture
Captured our own world.

A brother needs a sister
To watch what he can do,
To protect and to torture,
To boss around—it's true
But a brother will defend her
For a sister's love is pure,
Because she thinks he's wonderful
When he is not so sure.

In the picture there's a fender
Of our old Chevrolet
Or Pontiac—our dad would know,
Surely he could say
But dad is dead and we grow old
It's true that time flies by
And in forty years the world has changed
As well as you and I.",Picture
Loudon Wainwright III,"Hey, Bob Dylan, I wrote you a song
Today is your birthday if I'm not wrong
If I'm not mistaken, you're 50 today
How are you doin', Bob? What do you say?

Well, it musta been about '62
I heard you on record, you were brand new
And some had some doubts about the way you sang
But the truth came through and loudly it rang

Yeah, you were hipper than Mitch Miller
And Johnny Mathis put together

So I got some boots, a harmonica rack
A D-21, and I was on the right track
But I didn't start writing until '68
It was too damn daunting, you were too great
I won a whole lot of Bob Dylan imitation contests, though, huh

Yeah, times were a changin', you brought it all home
'Blonde On Blonde', 'Like A Rolling Stone'
The real world is crazy, you were deranged
And when you went electric, Bob, everything changed
A shock to the system

Had a commission at her motorcycle wreck
Holed up in Woodstock with a broken neck
And the labels were signin' up guys with guitars
Out to make millions, lookin' for stars

Well, I figured it was time to make my move
Songs from the West Chester County Delta country

Yeah, I got a deal and so did John Prine
Steve Forbert and Springsteen, all in a line
They were lookin' for you, signin' up others
We were new Bob Dylans, your dumb ass kid brothers

Well, we still get together every week at Bruce's house
Why, he's got quite a spread I tell ya, it's a twelve step program

Yeah, but we were just us and of course you were you
And ""John Wesley Harding"" sure sounded new
And then, ""Nashville Skyline"" was even newer
'Blood On the Tracks' an' the ringin' got truer

Let's see, there was another one in there somewhere[Incomprehensible]
Oh, I got it, I got it, ""Self Portrait""
Well, it was an interesting effort

Yeah, had to stop listening, times were too tough
Me bein' the new me was hard enough
You keep right on changin' like you always do
An' what's best is the old stuff still all sounds new

Yeah, today is your birthday, have a great one, Bob
Bein' the new you is one hell of a job

When I heard you screamin' from her room

But who the hell was he?
Who was that tall fat man
They buried in your place?
Just another imitator;
Plastic surgeons did his face.

You still love to ball.
Somebody said she spotted you
In a Memphis mall.
Check out the checkout counters;
Read what the tabloids say:
Aliens abducted you,
But somehow you got away.

For instance could not produce tears
As a child he had cried as all children will
Then at some point his tear ducts ran dry
He grew to be a man, the feces hit the fan
Things got bad, but he couldn't cry

His dog was run over, his wife up and left him
And after that he got sacked from his job
Lost his arm in the war, was laughed at by a whore
Ah, but sill not a sniffle or sob

His novel was refused, his movie was panned
And his big Broadway show was a flop

He got sent off to jail; you guessed it, no bail
Oh, but still not a dribble or drop

In jail he was beaten, bullied and buggered
And made to make license plates
Water and bread was all he was fed
But not once did a tear stain his face

Doctors were called in, scientists, too
Theologians were last and practically least

They all agreed sure enough; this was sure no cream puff
But in fact an insensitive beast

He was removed from jail and placed in a place
For the insensitive and the insane
He played lots of chess and made lots of friends
And he wept every time it would rain

Once it rained forty days and it rained forty nights
And he cried and he cried and he cried and he cried

On the forty-first day, he passed away
He just dehydrated and died

Well, he went up to heaven, located his dog
Not only that, but he rejoined his arm
Down below, all the critics, they loot it all back
Cancer robbed the whore of her charm

His ex-wife died of stretch marks, his ex-employer went broke
The theologians were finally found out

Right down to the ground, that old jail house burned down
The earth suffered perpetual drought",The Man Who Couldn't Cry
Loudon Wainwright III,"Suddenly it's Christmas
Right after Hallowe'en
Forget about Thanksgiving
It's just a buffet in between.
There's lights and tinsel in the window
They're stocking up the shelves.
Santa's slaving at the North Pole
In his sweatshop full of elves.

There's got to be a build-up 
To the day that Christ was born.
The halls are decked with pumpkins
And ears of Indian corn.
Dragging through the falling leaves
In a one-horse open sleigh.
Suddenly it's Christmas 
Seven weeks before the day.

Suddenly it's Christmas
The longest holiday.
When they say 'Season's Greetings'
They mean just what they say.
It's a season, it's a marathon
Retail eternity
And it's not over til it's over
And you throw away the tree.

Outside it's positively balmy/barmy
In the air nary a nip.
Suddenly it's Christmas
Unbuttoned and unzipped.
Yes, they're working overtime
Santa's little runts.
Christmas comes but once a year
And goes on for two months.

Christmas carols in December
And November too.
It's no wonder we're depressed
When the whole thing is through.
Finally it's January 
Let's sing Auld Lang Syne
But here comes another party
Shaped like a Valentine.

Suddenly it's Christmas
The longest holiday.
The season is upon us
A pox! It won't go away.
It's a season, it's a marathon
Retail eternity.
And it's not over til it's over
And you throw away the tree.
No it's not over til it's over
And you throw away the tree.
It's still not over til it's over
And you throw away the tree.",Suddenly It's Christmas

This summer I went swimming, 
This summer I might have drowned 
But I held my breath and I kicked my feet 
And I moved my arms around, I moved my arms around.

This summer I swam in the ocean, 
And I swam in a swimming pool, 
Salt my wounds, chlorine my eyes, 
I'm a self-destructive fool, a self-destructive fool.

This summer I swam in a public place 
And a reservoir, to boot, 
At the latter I was informal, 
At the former I wore my suit, I wore my swimming suit.

This summer I did the backstroke 
And you know that's not all 
I did the breast stroke and the butterfly 
And the old Australian crawl, the old Australian crawl.

It's workin like a landmine in almost every sentence

Yeah it might have started back with Jack Kerouac
Probably more than likely it was Maynard G. Krebs
It's the four letter word that used to mean 'as if'
And the meaning's covered in cobwebs
Cobwebs

Used to be a preposition then it was a conjunction
Now it's used as an audible pause

Chickens from the 60s finally comin into roost

Just to give my cool quota just a little bitty kind of a boost

But when I hear it
I can't stand it
Especially coming out of the mouths of one of my own kids

It's been taught and, God,
What have we wrought?
Give a listen here, what do we dig?

I prefer ah or er
You can rest assured
If you're sayin what you mean then it don't mean a thing
It's just an ugly little four letter word

Doesn't anybody care or am I the only one?
Am I just stuck back in some kind of a past?
Maybe it's harmless but it feels like a virus
And it sounds like it's catchin on fast

He's got some problems--no, you can't solve them--
He's got some goblins that he can't exorcise.
Mostly he wants to cry, he's afraid to die,
But he's living life like it's a booby prize.

And he's paranoid you feel that way too;
So reassure him, you'll never cure him,

I grind the beans, squeeze the juice
And butter up the toast

Ninety minutes at the most

I've grabbed from the plate
And I've stabbed with a knife

My common-law stepmom
I desire and fear her
I compare you to me

Sharing hair, forehead lines
Scowling, worrying, thinking
With a penchant for white wines
A disposal toward drinking

In the bathroom mirror

But that's what works, isn't that sad?

Young women want to mother you
You hate it but you want them to
What... what are families for?

All grown up, holding your own
You fend them off by telephone

You keep in touch, it's come to this
The furtive hug, suspicious kiss

Your sister's ensconced in your life
The archetype of an an ex-wife

For all that dirt he ate back then
Your brother figures you owe him now

Mom wants back all that Dad took
But Dad is dead, he's off the hook
What... what are families for?

Loudon Wainwright III,"Oh the world is a terrible place
Look at the look on your face
It says it all
This world's appalling
And we ache for outer space
'Cause the world is a terrible place

And the world is a crappy old hole
From bottom to top and pole to pole
No there's no good news
This world's useless
I'm out of here it's my goal
Cause the world is a crappy old hole

And the world is a sandwich of shite
Every day you take another bite
You think you're Superman
Sure you can handle it
'Til you come across kryptonite
Chunky style
The world is a sandwich of shite alright

What a wonderful world it would be
If wishes were horses maybe
It's just a song Louis' coming on strong again
We ache for fantasy
What a wonderful world it would be

Cause the world is a dirty old joke
And there's no way to fix it, it's broke
It's beyond repair and I couldn't care less
If and when it goes up in smoke
And it will
Cause the world is a dirty old crappy old shitty old terrible joke

Loudon Wainwright III,"I slept through the night, I got through to the dawn
I flipped a switch and the light went on
I got out of bed and I put some clothes on
It's a pretty good day so far

I turned the tap, there was cold there was hot
I put on my coat to go to the shop
I stepped outside, and I didn't get shot
It's a pretty good day so far

I didn't hear any sirens or explosions
No murders coming in form those heavy guns
No UN tanks, I didn't see one
It's a pretty good day so far

No snipers in windows, taking a peak
No people panic, running scared through the streets
I didn't see any bodies without arms, legs, or feet
It's a pretty good day

There was plasma bandages and electricity
Food, wood, and water; and the air was smoke free
No camera crews from my TV
It was all such a strange sight to be home

Nobody was frightened, wounded, hungry, or cold
And the children seemed normal, they didn't look old
It's a pretty good day so far
I walked through a park, you would not believe it

There in the park, there were a few trees left
And on some branches, there were a few leaves
I slept through the night, got through to the dawn
I flipped the switch and the light went on

I wrote down my dream, I wrote this song
It's a pretty good day so far",Pretty Good Day
Loudon Wainwright III,"If they had to tell someone that something had happened
If they found me just lying there what could they do?
In case of an accident who could they notify
Would it be alright if they notified you?

I'm an unmarried orphan whose children have scattered
Estranged from my siblings close friends just a few
And of those few friends I consider you closest 
They must contact someone 
Could they contact you?

When they give you the bad news 
I'm sure you won't snicker
You'll remember the good times and all we went through
Then I suppose that you'll tell all the others
Performing that awful task, someone has to

When they go through my wallet and fish out my license
They'll learn my D.O.B and my eyes were blue
As for my corneas, I don't care who gets them
But all other organs and parts are for you",Donations
Loudon Wainwright III,"When you were alive, I was never alone
Somewhere in the world, there was something called home
And as long as you lived, I would be alright
There were reasons to win, and incentives to fight
Now I'm smoking again
I thought all that was through
And I don't wanna live
But what else can I do

And I feel like I've faked all that I ever did
And I've grown a gray beard, but I cry like a kid
I was seven when I sang you'd rosin the bow
There in Aunt Mary's kitchen and I don't guess I know
That it's why I've done this for all of this time
But now I'm playing and singing, seems a game or a crime
People have called to find out if I'm fine

I assure them I am
But I'm not, it's a lie
They say in the end, your good friends pull you through
But everyone knows, my best friend was you

Hey, I've gotten some help
I guess I was afraid
You suppose something will happen when someone is paid
But I am getting better once again I'll be strong
After all, listen, I'm singing this song

When you were alive I was never alone
Somewhere in the world there was something called home

Now I feel like I'm homeless but I will be alright
I'll get through the days
I'll face-down the night",Homeless
Loudon Wainwright III,"You sit at a desk and you squirm in a chair
You stretch out on a couch, you could fall asleep there
But you lie in your bed and you try not to think
You put on your bathrobe and you stand at the sink
And then you look into the mirror and you unplug the phone
You re-read the letter, you're living alone.

You clear out a closet and you listen to a clock
You wipe off a table and you pick up a sock
And then you put up your feet and you stand on your head
You hate what you did and you regret what you said
And then you gaze at a spapshot and wait for the tone
You talk to yourself, yeah, you're living alone.

You were always alone, but you just didn't know it
You tried living with someone but then you had to blow it
And if there's one thing you learned after living with her
Is that you're not the man now that you never were.

So you turn up the heat and you fight off a cold
You thumb through the Bible as you sit there on hold
But you're your own boss you can do as you please
Open a window and let in a breeze
You sit down to dinner, yeah, you cooked your own
You light a candle, you're living alone.

You think about her and how did it end
Your cleaning lady has become your very best friend
You're back in your hometown, you're living in fear
They wonder where has he been and why is he here
You're watching the reruns of the Twilight Zone
Your life in a nutshell, you're living alone.

You were always alone, but you just didn't see it
You tried to be someone different but you just couldn't be it
And if there's one thing you learned after all of it
Is that you're usually fired before you can quit.

What you need is a dog, some goldfish or a cat
A boa constrictor and a laboratory rat
The end is at hand now and you have the means
A roll of toilet paper and the right magazines
Your parents are dead now and your kids are full grown
You're 53 now, you're 53 now, you're 53 now
You're living alone.",Living Alone
Loudon Wainwright III,"The slap of the paper
The hiss of the sprinkler
The beep of the coffee machine

I pick up the paper

Who's able to procure our love

Next door the kid's starting a band
Their morning rehearsal is making me crazy
The volume is way out of hand
It's not music
To my music it's way out of hand

A few words from you can lift me off the ground.
Your letters are treasures, you don't know their worth.

It means the world to me, those few words from you.

Loudon Wainwright III,"Take me home to the place where I first saw the light,
To the sweet sunny south, take me home,
Where the mockingbirds sang me to sleep every night 
Oh, why was I tempted to roam?

Oh I think with regret of the dear home I left
And the warm hearts that sheltered me then,
Of the wife and dear ones of whom I'm bereft,
And I sigh for the old place again.

Take me home to the place where the orange trees grow,
To my cot in the evergreen shade,
Where the flowers on the river's green margins once
bestowed
All their sweetness on the banks where we played.

The path to our cottage they say it has grown green
And the place is quite lonely around,
And I know that the smiles and the forms I have seen
Now lie in the cold mossy ground.

But yet, I'll return to the place of my birth,
Where my children used to play at the door,
Where they pulled the white blossoms that garnished the
earth,
Which will echo their footsteps no more.

Take me home to the place where my little ones sleep
And their mother lies buried nearby -
O'er the graves of my loved ones I long there to weep
And among them to rest when I die.",Sweet Sunny South
Loudon Wainwright III,"For 20 odd years I have strummed on guitars
5,000 lost flat picks, four fingertip scars
I must have broken a million g strings
Picking and strumming, and playing these things
Banging and tunin', and playing these things.

And it's been 16 years now that I've written songs
Over a 100 and still growing strong
About drinking and hockey and flying above
Again and again about unhappy love
Over and over, unhappy love.

And it's music for money, but I'll do it for fun
Oh, I know how to do it, it's easily done
To stand on a stage doesn't make me afraid
I'm comfortable up there, it's gotten me laid
It always amazes me when I get paid.

So here am I doing all that I can do

Folks wanna win, when they can choose, but more important than that, folks don't wanna lose

Yes indeed he was;
Talkin' 'bout the guy that made it sound so good

But Hawkins was his name

He sure could swing and play pretty too
Sounds good to me, should sound good to you
I love to hear him playing Body and Soul
Very pleasing to the ear

When I first heard it on the record
I just stopped, right there,
Sounded like a band of angels in the sky,
And I have never ever heard a sweeter tone
In fact I pay no 'ttention to the saxophone
'Til Coleman Hawkins came along and spoke to everyone,
Saying better listen won't you hear me,
While I play for you,

Sometimes it's hot
Then again it's blue

Pleasing each and everyone,
It's what I've long been craving for

The doors have not been always open,
But I am trying to please you.
Please don't try to stop me.
Hope you like it folks

And then he started cookin',
Every time he played
Some melodic melody fast or slow
You could tell that it was Hawkins,

No other one ever has
Quite captured his tone
Just he alone,
Has the sound that penetrates
It will sure go right through you
Yes it will,
And every chorus gives you just another thrill

Then along came Eddie Jefferson
He sang the melody like Hawkins played it
He sang it true
He sang it blue
Made words for it too

All his fans in New York loved him
There's no one above him
Here in the USA
I've heard 'em say ol' Eddie was the man

Oh how he could sing
Man did he swing
Sang on the wing, did his own thing
Yes he did

Throughout the country,
Music lovers are still wiggin' on Eddie's singin'
All around the world, he is known
Rhythm was his special joy,
He swung it like a horn

He must have been born to be a singer
'Cause his lyrics were so sincere and true
Funny sad or blue
Oh yeah!

And we've got to remind you
Many years it took him
Singing every day to achieve his first claim to fame

He was twenty years ahead of his time
And he knew it
But he kept right on-a singing
He went all around the world making rhythm
'Cause music sure was in him and he knew it was

Sang with Moody and Richie Cole
He could sing it just like Bird
But his forte was the words he wrote to
Music that he sang

So he sang, and he sang
And he sang his words so clever
And I know they'll silence him never
'Cause he cut this masterpiece

And now we're trying to sing it for you
Hope the Bean and Eddie both would still approve
There we go
We didn't mean to reminisce
You can surely bet
That we won't forget
'Cause we hear them yet

Louie Bellson,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

Louis Armstrong,"A little jazz is just a bit of this and that
Sometimes we sing, sometimes we play, sometimes we scat
But most of all it's how you feel about the groove
And when it's groovin', how the groove makes you move

Jazz music sprouted rock and roll
It was the very first music that we call soul
Jazz is hot, it's cool, it's good, it's bad
And it can change your mood to happy from sad

Jazz is hip, it's groovy, it's fresh, it's jive
And when you play it, it makes your soul come alive
You know it's the upbeat rhythm that makes it bop
And once you get it started, well, it sure is hard to stop

No other music can compare
When the bass starts walkin', it fills the air
You know that the sass of brass has made it last
And it's the groove of blues from present to past

Hey, what about some of those great legends of jazz?
Yeah, like Jazz Royalty
Oh, you mean Duke Ellington and Count Bassie
What about the great horn players?
Louis Armstrong, yeah, and Miles and Dizzy too
Don't forget Snookie
What about Yarnburn?
What, don't you mean Charlie Parker?
Yeah, this cool named Freddy Hubert

Louis Armstrong,"Galveston, oh, Galveston
I still hear your seawinds blowing
I still see her dark eyes glowing
She was twenty one, when I left Galveston

Galveston, oh, Galveston
I still hear your seawaves crashin
While I watch the cannons flashin'
I clean my gun, and dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me
On the beach where we used to run
Galveston, oh, Galveston
I am so afraid of dying
Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch your sea birds flying
In the sun, at Galveston, at Galveston",I Gotta Right to Sing the Blues [Index0: False Start/Index1: Breakdown]
Louis Armstrong,"Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee

A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous; he answers twice
It's really killin'
That he's so willin' to make whoopee

Picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring

He's washin' dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious he even sews
But don't forget, folks
That's what you get, folks, for makin' whoopee

Another year or maybe less
What's this I hear? Well, you can't confess
She feels neglected, and he's suspected
Of makin' whoopee

She sits alone 'most every night
He doesn't phone her; he doesn't write
He says he's busy, but she says, ""Is he?""
He's makin' whoopee

He doesn't make much money
Only five thousand per
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, ""You'll pay six to her""

He says, ""Now, Judge, suppose I fail?""
The judge says, ""Budge right into jail""

Louis Armstrong,"You go to my head
You linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round
In my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne
You go to my head

Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two
The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought
To my plea, casts a spell over me

Still I say to myself
Get ahold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be
You go to my head with a smile
That makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julys
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance
In this crazy romance
You go to my head, you go to my head

Louis Armstrong,"'Neath the stars, at bazaars
Often I've had to caress men
Five or ten, dollars then, I'd collect from all those yes-men
Don't be sad, I must add, that they meant no more than chess-men

Darling, can't you see?
'Twas for charity?
Though these lips have made slips, it was never really serious
Who'd have thought, I'd be brought to a state that's so delirious?

I could cry salty tears
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now
How long has this been goin' on?

There were chills up my spine
And some thrills I can't define
Listen sweet, I repeat
How long has this been goin' on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt
Into Heaven I'm hurled
I know how Columbus felt
Finding another world

Kiss me once, then once more
What a dunce I was before
What a break, for Heaven's sake

When I'm out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face

[Chorus]
I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me, why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?
Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
But I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see you obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
But I get a kick out of you

And it seems that I can see
The gleaming candlelight

Louis Armstrong,"O! say can you see by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;
O! say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?",The Star Spangled Banner

If you're kinda lonely
All by you're only
Then nothin' but the blues are brewin'

If love goes a thirsting

But you ain't got nobody
You only get a gleam in your eyes

I choose me bristles with pride

And a broom for the flume

Though I'm covered with soot
From me 'ead to me toes
A sweep knows 'e's welcome

Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining

The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

If it's blues you are cravin' just come on down.

What's that familiar strain that true blue note refrain
It's drivin' me insane,
Can't keep still, tho' it's against my will;
I'm on my P's and Q's I just can't refuse.

There goes that melody, it sounds so good to me,
And I am up a tree,
It's a shame, you don't know the name;
It's a brand new blues,

Everybody grab somebody And start jazzing 'round

Hon don't you hear that trombone moan? 
Just listen to that saxophone.
Gee, hear that clarinet and flute, 
Cornet jazzin' with a mute,
Makes me just throw myself away, 
When I hear 'em play.

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So, tell me, why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?

Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too

Louis Armstrong,"I went down to the St. James Infirmary
Saw my baby there
Stretched out on a long white table
So sweet, so cold, so fair

She can look this wide world over
She'll never find a sweet man like me

Put a twenty-dollar gold piece on my watch chain

Louis Armstrong,"When a fellow loves a maiden
And that maiden doesn't love him,
It's the same as when a bald man
Finds a comb upon the highway.

The cucaracha, the cucaracha,
Doesn't want to travel on
Because she hasn't,
Oh no, she hasn't
Marihuana for to smoke.

All the maidens are of pure gold;
All the married girls are silver;
All the widows are of copper,
And old women merely tin.

My neighbor across the highway
Used to be called Doa Clara,
And if she has not expired
Likely that's her name tomorrow.

All the girls up at Las Vegas
Are most awful tall and skinny,
But they're worse for plaintive pleading
Than the souls in Purgatory.

All the girls here in the city
Don't know how to give you kisses,
While the ones from Albuquerque
Stretch their necks to avoid misses.

All the girls from Mexico
Are as pretty as a flower
And they talk so very sweetly,
Fill your heart quite up with love.

One thing makes me laugh most hearty

Now the Carranzistas beat it
Because Villa's men are coming.

Frankie went down to the drugstore
Some ice cream she wanted to buy
The soda jerk told her that Johnny
Was making love to Nellie Bligh

He was her man
But he was doing her wrong

Now Frankie's dad was a policeman
She stole his old forty-four gun
Then back to the drugstore she beat it
Just as fast as she could run

After her man
Who was doing her wrong

Now Frankie peaked in on the party
She got a surprise when she saw
That Nellie and Johnny were making love
And sipping soda through a straw

He was her man
But he was doing her wrong

So Frankie flew into a tantrum
She whipped out that old forty-four
And her rootie-toot-boom, that gal did shoot
Right through that hardwood swinging door

She shot her man
'Cause he was doing her wrong

So bring on your crepe and your flowers
Bring on your rubber-tired hack

Louis Armstrong,"Do you know what is means to miss New Orleans
I miss it, each night and day
The longer I stay away
Miss the moist covered vines
The tall sugar pines
Where mocking birds use to sing
And I like to see the lazy Mississippi
Are hurrying to spring
The mardy grass memories
Of creol tunes that fill the air
I dream of Orleanders in June
And soon I'm wishing that I was there
Do you know what is means to miss New Orleans
And there is something more
I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans",Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?

Wearin' a bird of paradise!

And he shows 'em, pearly white
Just a jack knife has Macheath dear
And he keeps it way out of sight

When that shark bites with his teeth, dear
Scarlet billows they begin to spread
Fancy white gloves has Macheath dear
So there's never, never a trace of red

On the sidewalk, one Sunday morning
Lies a body, oozin' life
Someone's sneaking 'round the corner
Could that someone perhaps, per chance be Mack the Knife

From a tugboat, on the river going slow
A cement bag is dropping down 
You know that cement is for the weight dear
You can make a large bet Macheath's in town

My man Louis Miller, he split the scene babe
After drawing out all the bread from his stash
Now Macheath spends like a sailor
Do you suppose this guy, he did something rash

Old Satchmo, Louis Armstrong, Bobby Darrin
They did this song nice, Lady Ella too
They all sang it, with so much feeling
That Old Blue Eyes, he ain't gonna add nothing new

But with this big, fat band, jumping behind me
Swinging hard, Jack, I know I can't lose
When I tell you, all about Mack the Knife babe
It's an offer, you can never refuse

We got Patrick Williams, Bill Miller playing that piano
And this wonderful, great big band, bringing up the rear
All these bad cats, in this band now 
They make the greatest sounds, you're ever gonna hear

Oh Sookie Taudry, Jenny Diver, Polly Peachum, Old Miss Lulu Brown

It could be cars, it could be clothes
Or just a stylish shoe
But if you like your dancin'
Better take my tip
Get set, warn the band, and let 'er rip

A little to the right
Get hold of your partner

And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he, for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong,  the man I love
And when he comes my way,
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.

He'll build a little home just meant for two
From which I'll never roam, who would? would you?

I commission you, find a riff that's new

Louis Armstrong,"If we never meet again, I'll have a rose to remember
The snows of December will bring you back to me
If we never meet again, I'll fall asleep in the flowers
And dream of the hours we spent in ecstasy

The leaves in the fall will wreak all the beauty I found in your eyes
The birds in the spring when they sing, will tell me that love never dies
If we never meet again, as sure as heaven above you
Forever I'll love you if we never meet again

",If We Never Meet Again
Louis Armstrong,"Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

If love still can remember
The spark may burn again

Louis Armstrong,"Sun showers
It might rain
Sun will shine again
So sun showers

In a little while
The sky above will smile
Like laughter
That follows your tears

Dark clouds of sorrow

While sunflowers raise their little eyes

Louis Armstrong,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans?
I miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's gettin' stronger
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss covered vines, the tall sugar pines
Where mockin' birds used to sing
And I'd like to see the lazy Mississippi
Hurryin' into spring

The Mardi Gras, the memories
Of Creole's tunes that fills the air
I dream of old [unverified] in June
And soon I'm wishin' that I were there

Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
When that's where I left my heart?
And there's something more, I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans

Louis Armstrong,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

He was a Frenchman, a hero of the war

And here's how peace had crowned him

Where the better ghosts and goblins always hang out
One night they threw a party tn a manner a la mode
And they cordially invited all the gang out

At a dark, bewitchin' hour when the fun was loud and hearty
A notorious wall flower became the life of the party
Mmm, the spooks were havin' their midnight fling
The merry makin' was in full swing

They shrieked themselves into a cheerful trance
When the skeleton in the closet started to dance
Now a goblin giggled with fiendish glee
A shout rang out from a big banshee

Amazement was in every ghostly glance
When the skeleton in the closet started to dance
All the witches were in stitches while his steps made rhythmic thumps
And they nearly dropped their broomsticks when he tried to do the bumps

You never heard such unearthly laughter, such hilarious groans
When the skeleton in the closet rattled his bones",The Skeleton in the Closet

Louis Armstrong,"Now have you read of the fable of Cain and Abel?
Once they were in a scandal that shook the town.
Cain became mighty jealous of brother Abel,
So he rose up and smote Abel down.

Now the Lord sure was hopping mad,
And yet he was plenty sad,
to think that he had a man like Cain.

The Lord spoke and showed his wrath,
And Cain walked the path
That led to a life full of pain.

You can't run from the shadow of retribution.
If you're bad then you gotta pay for your wrongs.

Don't lament, be content,
Don't resent what the Lord has sent,

Folks down there live a life of ease,
When the twilight brings the evening breeze,
It's sleepy time down south.

Steamboats on the river a-comin' and a-goin',
Splashing the night away,
Hear those banjos ringin', the folks are all a-singin',
They dance till break of day.

Dear old southland, with its dreamy songs
Takes me back there where I belong,
How I'd love to be in mother's arms
When it's sleepy time down south.",When It's Sleepy Time Down South [Alternative Lyric Version]
Louis Armstrong,"When we are dancing and you're dangerously near me
I get ideas, I get ideas
I want to hold you so much closer than I dare to
I want to scold you 'cause I care more than I care to

And when you touch me and there's fire in every finger
I get ideas, yes, I get ideas
And after we have kissed goodnight and still you linger
I kinda think you get ideas too

Your eyes are always saying the things you're never saying
I only hope they're saying that you could love me too
For that's the whole idea; it's true
Lovely idea that I'm falling in love with you

And after we have kissed goodnight and still you linger
Babe, I kinda think you get ideas too",(When We Are Dancin') I Get Ideas
Louis Armstrong,"Chloe! Chloe!
Someone's calling, no reply
Nightshade's falling, hear him sigh
Chloe! Chloe!

Empty spaces in his eyes
Empty arms outstretched, he's crying

Through the black of night
I've got to go where you are
If it's dark or bright
I've got to go where you are

I'll go through the dismal swampland
Searching for you
For if you are lost there
Let me be there too

Through the smoke and flame
I've got to go where you are
For no ways can be too far
Where you are

Ain't no chains can bind you
If you live, I'll find you
Love is calling me
I've got to go where you are",Chloe

Louis Armstrong,"Hey, baby, how about this dance?
Why?
'Cause it takes two to do this dance

Takes two to tango, two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
Let's do the tango, do the tango
Do the dance of love

You can sail on a ship by yourself
Take a nap or a nip by yourself
You can get into debt on your own
There's a lot of things that you can do alone

But

Takes two to tango, two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
Let's do the tango, do the tango
Do the dance of love

You can stare at the moon by yourself
Take a laugh like a loon by yourself
Spend a lot, go to pot on your own
There's a lot of things that you can do alone

But, listen here

Louis Armstrong,"I touch your lips and all at once the sparks go flying
Those devil lips that know so well the art of lying
And though I see the danger, still the flame grows higher
I know I must surrender to your kiss of fire

Just like a torch, you set the soul within me burning
I must go on, I'm on this road of no returning
And though it burns me and it turns me into ashes
My whole world crashes without your kiss of fire

I can't resist you, what good is there in trying?
What good is there denying you're all that I desire?
Since first I kissed you my heart was yours completely
If I'm a slave, then it's a slave I want to be
Don't pity me, don't pity me

Give me your lips, the lips you only let me borrow
Love me tonight and let the devil take tomorrow
I know that I must have your kiss although it dooms me
Though it consumes me, your kiss of fire

I can't resist you, what good is there in trying?
What good is there denying you're all that I desire?
Since first I kissed you my heart was yours completely
If I'm a slave, then it's a slave I want to be

Give me your lips, the lips you only let me borrow
Love me tonight and let the devil take tomorrow
I know that I must have your kiss although it dooms me
Though it consumes me, the kiss of fire!

There was three children from the land of Israel
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
They took a little trip to the land of Babylon
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Nebudchanezzer was the king of Babylon
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
He took a lot of gold, and made an idol

And he told everybody ""when you hear the music of the trombone""
And he told everybody ""when you hear the music of the clarinet""
And he told everybody ""when you hear the music of the horn
You must fall down and worship the idol""

But the children of Israel would not bow down
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Couldn't fool 'em with a golden idol
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
I said, you couldn't fool 'em with a golden idol

So the king put the children in the fiery furnace
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Heaped on coals and red-hot brimstone

Eleven times hotter, hotter than it ought to be
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Burned up the soldiers that the king had put there

But the Lord sent an angel with the snow-white wings
Down in the middle of the furnace

And trees whisper day is ending,
My thoughts are ever wending Home.
When the crickets call,
My heart is forever yearning,
Once more to be returning Home.
When the hills conceal the setting sun,
Stars begin a peeping one by one.
Night covers all 
And, though fortune may forsake me,
Sweet dreams will ever take me Home.

That I always have found it best,

And I can feel after every line 
A thrill divine 
Down my spine.

Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny little tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'ry mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

So I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although' it's been said many times, many ways

And to you your carol too
And God bless you and send you
A happy New Year
And God send you

And soon miss fanny bright
Was seated by my side

Misfortune seemed his lot
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upshot

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young

A poem as lovely as a tree
A tree whose hungry mouth is pressed
Against the earth's sweet flowing breast

O, a tree that looks at God all day
And lifts her leafy arms to pray
A tree that may in summer wear
Yeah, a nest of robins in her hair

Upon whose bosom snow has lain
Who intimately lives with rain [Incomprehensible]
Poems are made by fools like me
But only God can make a tree

But in my heart there's only pain
You went traveling, but will it last?

Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home

I looked over Jordan, and what did I see?
Coming for to carry me home
A band of angels coming after me
Coming for to carry me home

If you get there before I do
Coming for to carry me home
Tell all my friends I'm coming too
Coming for to carry me home

I'm sometimes up and sometimes down
Coming for to carry me home

Coming for to carry me home

Coming for to carry me home

When the new wears off of your crystal chandeliers?

And it's plain to see that the likes of me don't fit with you
So you traded me for the gaiety of the well-to-do
And you turned away from the love I offered you

Through the swamps and the everglades.
There's a big ol' hole in Tiger Mountain.

But she had unfaithful ways.
She made me feel I wasn't wanted,
Like the bats and the bears in Miller's Cave.

I couldn't stand the way she did me.
Couldn't take her low down ways.
Before I'll stay with a cheatin' woman,
I'll go and live with the bears in Miller's Cave.

Caught her out, Sunday morning,
With some guy they call big Dave.
The meanest man in Waycross, Georgia,
I'd rather fight a mountain lion in Miller's Cave.

I said: ""You'll pay both you and Davey,
""I'm gonna see you in your grave.""
They laughed at me and then I shot 'em,
I took their cheating, scheming bones to Miller's Cave.

They took a little trip to the land of Babylon

Nebudchanezzer was the king of Babylon
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
He took a lot of gold, and made an idol

And he told everybody ""when you hear the music of the clarinet""
And he told everybody ""when you hear the music of the horn
You must fall down and worship the idol""

Couldn't fool 'em with a golden idol

I said, you couldn't fool 'em with a golden idol

So the king put the children in the fiery furnace

Heaped on coals and red-hot brimstone

Eleven times hotter, hotter than it ought to be

Burned up the soldiers that the king had put there

But the Lord sent an angel with the snow-white wings
Down in the middle of the furnace

For me
Been an awful good girl
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, a '54 convertible too
Light blue
I'll wait up for you, dear
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you'll check off my Christmas list
Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
Been an angel all year
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa honey, one little thing I really need the deed
To a platinum mine
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa cutie, and fill my stocking with a duplex 
And checks
Sign your 'x' on the line
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tif-fa-ny
I really do believe in you
Lets see if you believe in me

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
I don't mean on the phone
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight 
Hurry down the chimney tonight 
Hurry, tonight",Santa Baby
Louis Armstrong,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Louis Armstrong,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny little tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'ry mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

So I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although' it's been said many times, many ways
""Merry Christmas to you""

Love and joy come to you
And to you your carol too
And God bless you and send you
A happy New Year
And God send you
A happy New Year",The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire) [Live at the Cresce

The orange and palm trees sway
There's never been such a day
In Beverly Hills, L.A.

But it's December the 24th
And I'm longing to be up North

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas,
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas,
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen

May your days be merry and bright,
And may all your Christmases be white

Some say it's honey and the bee,
Well sit right down and let me tell you
What my love is to me.

I call my sugar ""Candy""
Because I'm sweet on ""Candy""
And ""Candy"" is sweet on me

He/She understands me,
My understanding ""Candy""
And ""Candy""'s always handy
When I need sympathy
I wish that there were four of him/her
So I could love much more of him/her

He/She has taken my complete heart,
Got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart

Its gonna be just dandy
The day I take my ""Candy""
And make him mine all mine

Louis Armstrong,"On the summer shore, where the breakers roar
Lovers sat on the glist'ning sand
And they talked of love while the moon above
And the stars seemed to understand
Then she grew more cold, and he grew more bold
Till she tho't that they had better go
But altho' he heard, he not even stirred
Only murmured in tones soft and low

Cuddle up a little closer, lovey mine
Cuddle up and be my little clinging vine
Like to feel your cheek so rosy
Like to make you comfy, cozy
'Cause I love from head to toesie, lovey mine

Then she deigned to rest on his manly chest
Her dear head with its flowing curls
And she said, ""I'd stay on this lap for aye
How I envy the Capland girls!""
For Miss Esquimaux, 'mid the ice and snow
Has no steam-heat when he comes to call
Not a single glim, so it's up to him
To whisper in summer or fall

Though I may try and try, no one can satisfy

I'll never be free from your smile so tender
The sweet surrender in your eyes
How can I be free when I still remember?
How you could thrill me with a sigh

Made me a slave to you

Louis Armstrong,"I'm walking on air
For I left all my blue days behind
I've learned how to care
And there's love, really love on my mind

I'm the world's most happy creature
Tell me what can worry be
I'm crazy 'bout my baby
Baby is crazy 'bout me

Mr. Cupid was our teacher
That's the reason we agree
Yes, I'm crazy 'bout my baby
And my baby crazy 'bout me

Papa, get that book out
Ready in your hand
Keep a steady look out
And you can understand

It's an A-one combination
With a perfect he and she
I'm crazy 'bout my baby
And my baby is crazy 'bout me

Fallin' for nobody else but you
Mama, you caught my eye and I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'
Show me the ring and I'll jump right through

Now I'm a-tingle over you
Hey, Mister Parson, stand by, but I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'
Fallin' for nobody else but you",I've Got a Feeling I'm Falling
Louis Armstrong,"Maybe it's because the kiss you gave me
Touched my heart and went right through
Now I can't tell you why; I only know that I
Fell helplessly in love with you

Oh, maybe it's because the song we danced to
Told a story old and new
I can't figure out just why it came about
Or how I fell in love with you

I could say you're grand and therefore
I care for you so
But there is a why and wherefore
And I'd like to know

Now maybe it's because the star I wished on
Made a certain wish come true
Or it just could be that you were meant for me
And maybe I was meant, oh baby, meant for you

Oh, baby, or it just could be that you were meant for me
And, baby, I was meant for you",Maybe It’s Because

If it's dark or bright
I've got to go where you are

I'll go through the dismal swampland
Searching for you

Beautiful, what's your hurry?
And my father will be pacing the floor
Just listen to that fireplace roar
Now really I'd better scurry
Sweetheart, what's your hurry?

Why don't you put some records on while I pour

I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?

Oh, but it's cold outside

I simply must go
Baby, it's cold outside

So lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out that window at that storm

My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
And my brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
Oh, my maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Ooo, baby you're so delicious
Well maybe just one little kiss more
Never such a blizzard before

Oh, I've got to go home
You'll freeze to the bone out there
Say, lend me a comb
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see?
How can you do this thing to me?

Oh, there's bound to be talk tomorrow
Making my lifelong sorrow
Well at least there will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
But I really can't stay
Get over that old out

That's the time the festive chink starts to wink his other eye, 
Starts to wink his dreamy eye, lazily you'll hear him sigh. 

Strangers taking in the sights, pigtails flying here and there. 
See that broken wall street sport, still thinks he's a millionaire. 
Still thinks he's a millionaire, pipe dreams banish every care.

Louis Armstrong,"I have always been a wanderer
Over land and sea
Yet a moonbeam on the water
Casts a spell o'er me
A vision fair I see
Again I seem to be

[Chorus]
Back home again in Indiana
And it seems that I can see
The gleaming candlelight
Still burning bright
Through the sycamores for me
The new-mown hay sends all its fragrance
Through the fields I used to roam
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash
How I long for my Indiana home

Fancy paints on memory's canvas
Scenes that we hold dear
We recall them in days after
Clearly they appear
And often times I see
A scene that's dear to me

You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals

Louis Armstrong,"One night farmer Brown was takin' the airs
Locked up the barnyard with the greatest of care
Down in the hen house, somethin' stirred
When he shouted, ""Who's there?""
This is what he heard

“There ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
So calm yourself and stop that fuss
There ain't nobody here but us
We chickens tryin' to sleep and you butt in
And hobble, hobble hobble hobble with your chin”

“There ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
You're stompin' around and shakin' the ground
You're kickin' up an awful dust
We chicken's tryin' to sleep and you butt in
And hobble, hobble hobble hobble, it's a sin”

“Tomorrow is a busy day
We got things to do, We got eggs to lay
We got ground to dig and worms to scratch
It takes a lot of settin', gettin' chicks to hatch”

“Ohh, there ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
So quiet yourself and stop that fuss
There ain't nobody here but us
Kindly point that gun the other way
And hobble, hobble hobble of and hit the hay”

Louis Armstrong,"Standing on the corner, I didn't mean no harm
Along come the police, he took me by the arm
It was down in Memphis, corner of Beale and Main
He says ""big boy, you'll have to tell me your name""

I said ""you'll find my name on the tail of my shirt
I'm a Tennessee hustler, I don't have to work""
Listen all you rounders, you better leave my women alone
'Cause I'll take my special and run all you rounders home

My good girl loves me, everybody knows
And she paid a hundred cash dollars just for me a suit of clothes
She come to the joint, a forty-four in each hand
She said ""stand aside all you women and men
'Cause I'm looking for my man""",Blue Yodel No. 9 (Standin' On The Corner)
Louis Armstrong and His Orchestra,"It's wonderful to look into your eyes
And realize you care a little bit
It's wonderful to know that you love me, babe

It's glorious to feel that
I'm a part of you sweetheart
To share your happiness
It's marvelous, how lovely love can be

Who dreamed that I'd be allowed
Through the doorway of Heaven
I'm drifting high on a cloud
You're an angel and this is Heaven, mama

It's wonderful to have
Your lips divine combined with mine
And dream forever more
It's wonderful to know that you love me
Oh babe, you love me too

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

No one ever will.

That shines in your hair,
And the brow that's all furrowed,
And wrinkled with care.
I kiss the dear fingers,
So toil-worn for me,
Oh, God bless you and keep you,

Ev'ry sorrow or care
In the dear days gone by,
Was made bright by the light
Of the smile in your eye,

In the window at night,
Your fond love has cheered me
And guided me right.

Louis Chédid,"Tous ces instants passés avec vous,
Le moindre de nos rendez-vous,
Cette complicité entre nous,
Ces confidences, ces mots doux,
Sans nos histoires d'amour, d'épiderme,
Le temps serait d'un lourd, la vie bien terne.
Qui console nos coeurs fragiles
Quand tout ne tient plus qu'à un fil,
Nous donne cette force tranquille,
Cette sensation juvénile
D'être plus grand, plus fort, plus beau
De voir les choses de bien plus haut ?

Mesdames, mesdemoiselles,
Si vous saviez comme on vous aime !
Sans vous nous ne serions à peine
Que la moitié de nous-mêmes,
Rien que des coeurs artificiels,
Peaux de chagrin qui s'traînent...
Mesdames, mesdemoiselles,
Comme on vous aime,
Mesdames, mesdemoiselles,
Comme on vous aime,
Comme on vous aime,
Comme on vous aime !

Par les, par les temps qui courent,
Envie de vous parler d'amour,
D'écrire sur papier velours
Des mots, des mots simples comme Bonjour,
Histoire de vous dire bien en face
Que derrière soupirs et grimaces,

Mesdames, mesdemoiselles,
Si vous saviez comme on vous aime !
Sans vous nous ne serions à peine
Que la moitié de nous-mêmes,

Louis Chédid,"Depuis des lustres, je me traîne 
Ce rabat-joie schizophrène,
Apôtre de la raison, 
Empêcheur de tourner en rond,
Un moraliste, un censeur 
Qui a le plaisir en horreur...
Pour moi qui pense le contraire, 
La vie est un enfer.

Mon moi et moi, 
C'est vraiment pas cool,
Pauvre de moi, des fois 
J'lui mettrais des coups de boule,
Sans arrêt à 
Me poser des questions qui m'embrouillent :
Comment, pourquoi ? 
Un vrai casse-couille.

Il dit que trop manger fait grossir,
Qu'à trop boire, trop fumer, on va prématurément vieillir,
Qu'il faut travailler pour réussir.
Quand je suis fatigué, il pousse des soupirs,
Jamais assez comme ci, jamais assez comme ça,
Reproches, réprimandes, en veux-tu ? En voilà !
Comment ai-je pu tomber sur ce malade mental
Qui prend son pied à me traiter comme un animal ?

Que l'on se croise intimidés

Depuis le temps qu'on se dit Vous,
Si l'on pensait un peu à nous,
Qu'on arrêtait les phrases creuses
Et qu'on passait aux choses sérieuses,

Si l'on parlait un peu d'amour,
Si l'on s'en allait faire un tour
Dans cet endroit bien plus glamour
Où le coeur bat comme un tambour,
Depuis le temps qu'on se tourne autour,
Si l'on changeait l'ordre du jour,
Si l'on parlait un peu d'amour,
Un peu d'amour.

Avant d'être totalement gâteux,
Qu'est-ce qu'on attend pour être deux ?
Depuis le temps qu'on se court après
Qu'est-ce qu'on attend pour s'effleurer ?

Laisse-toi aller c'est qu'ça c'est le mojo
Ça c'est le mojo
C'est qu'ça c'e",Mojo
Louis Chédid,"J'aimerais dessiner 
peindre 
jouer la comédie 
être un grand musicien 
avoir plein de projets 
et me réinventer 
toucher les gens, 
ne jamais perdre mes racines 
trouver ou m'affirmer.
 
Lire, écrire, savoir aimer, écouter, entendre, expliquer, 
connaître l'anglais et même l'espagnol, 
pourquoi pas d'autres langues. 
Etre impartial, être courageux, téméraire, travailleur, audacieux, 
respectueux, sensible, ouvert, juste être un artiste. 

La liste est longue, longue, longue 
La liste est longue, longue, longue 

Mieux connaître ma langue et son histoire 
ouvrir mes écoutilles 
chanter comme un oiseau 
voyager à tous les niveaux 
plaire, déplaire, 
goûter ou même apprendre l'art du silence 
être et surtout évoluer, travailler mon sens du rythme 
Innover échanger rencontrer, 
c'est sûr apprendre la nature, 
les animaux 
ne plus avoir peur des chiens 
m'intéresser et ne pas dénigrer 
la liste est longue oui très longue et elle ne s'arrêtera jamais. 

La liste est longue, longue, longue 
La liste est longue, longue, longue",Ode aux Envies
Louis Chédid,"Les bagnoles gueulent 
Les gens se pressent 
Suffocant seule 
Je dois m'en aller 

Les trottoirs bougent 
LE ciel s'effondre 
Tous les feux sont rouges 
Laissez moi passer 

Effluve de clope 
Parfum de bitume 
Mais c'est une révolte 
J'peux plus respirer 

Une ambiance louche 
Dans nos métros 
En moi fait louche 
J'peux pas rester 

Oh oui je t'aime 
Oui tu me plais 
Tu es vilaine 
Et je m'en vais 
Ma ville je t'aime 
Oui tu me plais 
Mais j'ai de la peine 
Et je m'en vais 

Partout sur tes murs 
Les publicités 
Comme seule armure 
Ma pauvre cité 

La nuit tes néons 
En rythme charmé 
Inondent nos maisons 
Je suis fatiguée 

Les cris et les crasses 
Partout dans le rues 
M’affolent me tracas 
Que je suis tendue 

C'est vrai que tu es belle 
Et que tu es sexy 
Mais je déploie mes ailes 
Cette fois c'est fini 

Oh oui je t'aime 
Oui tu me plais 
Tu es vilaine 
Et je m'en vais 
Ma ville je t'aime 
Oui tu me plais 
Mais j'ai de la peine 
Et je m'en vais 

Tu es si jolie 
J'avais oublié 
Ma ville chérie 
Je t'ai retrouvée 

J'aime ta folie 
Ton éclatante joie 
De jour comme de nuit 
Mon coeur est à toi 

Oh oui je t'aime 
Oui tu me plais 
Tu es vilaine 
Et je m'en vais 
Ma ville je t'aime 
Oui tu me plais 
J'ai de la peine 
Et je m'en vais 

Oh oui je t'aime 
Oui tu me plais 
Tu es vilaine

Louis Chédid,"Dans le sang 
Il y a un œdème qui me gène 
J'écris amer 
Pour me faire taire 
Pour me faire terre 

De toi à moi, 
Je ne sais pas aimer 
Sans pleurs tordu de peur, 
Se fânent les heures
 
Je griffe les murs, 
Pour me faire les ongles 

Lasse, lasse 
Je suis las de tous ces dîners d'amis 
Tout le monde s'embrasse 
Quelle folie cette comédie 
Chasseur de frime magnanime 

Je me plie électrique 
Sur mon œil dans le ventre 
Il faut bouger se laver 
Glisser sur la descente

Louis Chédid,"She's resplendent, so confident
La Seine La Seine La Seine

I realize l'm hypnotized
La Seine La Seine La Seine

I hear the moon singing a tune
La Seine La Seine La Seine

Is she divine? Is it the wine
La Seine La Seine La Seine

I don't know, don't know so don't ask me why
That' s how we are, La Seine and I I'm feel alive
When I'm beside
La Seine La Seine La Seine

From this angle, like an angle
La Seine La Seine La Seine

Upon the bridge
My heart does beat
Between the waves
We will be save
The air we breathe
Can you believe
Learn to forgive, up on a bridge

That' s how we are, La seine and I",La Seine
Louis Durra,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You
Louis Edmonds,"This is hard to say, but as I wandered through the lea
I felt for just a fleeting moment that I was suddenly free of being lonely;
Then I closed my eyes and saw the very reason why.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man walking by the sea
Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man walking by the sea
Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:
There but for you go I.
",There But for You Go I
Louis Edmonds,"I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you
",What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?
