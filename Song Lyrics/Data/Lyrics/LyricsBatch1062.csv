Nickelback,"Before this hits the ground,
Before this fades away,
I wanna let it out
And I don't wanna wait
So don't you let me down
And don't you hesitate
Before I turn around,
Before I walk away,
I want you to make me
Make me
Make me

Make me believe again
In some kind of faith
Help me to see again
Before it's too late
'Cause forever is never
That far away
Make me believe again,
Make me believe again,
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again
Believe again

If you could take the dirt
And wash it all away
If you could say the words
That make me want to stay
Just tell me there's a chance
To Hell with all the blame.
If you could take my hand,
If you could lead the way,
I want you to make me,
Make me,
Make me

Make me believe again
In some kind of faith
Help me to see again
Before it's too late
'Cause forever is never
That far away
Make me believe again,
Make me believe again,
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.

Make me believe again
In some kind of faith
Help me to see again
Before it's too late
'Cause forever is never
That far away

Make me believe again.
I can't pretend,

Nickelback,"Take one of those and two of these
Then watch the walls begin to breathe
I can taste the colour of the lights
Wings are growing out of me
The floor is floating underneath
I can see the future burning bright
Future burning bright

The ceiling has us mesmerised
It feels like we could never die
Heading for the dark side of the moon
As we lift off into the sky
Invincible and so alive
Ten feet tall and fucking bulletproof
Insanity is setting in
Reality is getting thin
The universe just started slowing down
Yet suddenly we're travelling

A million miles an hour
A million miles an hour
We're going a million miles an hour
A million miles an hour

When shadows all start breaking free
No longer held by gravity
How did we get so far from the ground?
Speaking to the galaxy
Received and sending back to me
I can finally hear the speed of sound
Speed of fucking sound

I like this everlasting pill
'Cause time itself is standing still
Why's the room still spinning just the same?
Turn off your phone so no one calls
'Cause you and I are tripping balls
I can still hear ringing in my brain
Insanity is setting in
Reality is getting thin
See no signs of ever coming down
And suddenly we're travelling

A million miles an hour
A million miles an hour
We're going a million miles an hour
A million miles an hour

Insanity is setting in
Reality is getting thin
The particles are dancing all around
I can't deny the hardest thing for me
Is finding time to finally breathe
See no signs of ever coming down
Another wave is coming in

A million miles an hour
A million miles an hour
We're going a million miles an hour
A million miles an hour",Million Miles an Hour
Nickelback,"I know it's late but something's on my mind
It couldn't wait, there's never any time
'Cause life slips by without a warning
And I'm tired of ignoring all the space that's between you and I
Let's lock the door behind us,
They won't find us
Make the whole world wait
While we

Dance around this bedroom
Like we've only got tonight
Not about to let you go
Until the morning light.
You can be my whole world
If I can be your satellite.

Let's dance around this bedroom
Like tonight's our only night
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite.

Do you recall how long it must have been
Since any room held only you and me?
And every song that sings about it
Says that we can't live without it
Now I know just what that really means.
Let's lock the door behind us,
They won't find us
Make the whole world wait
While we

Dance around this bedroom
Like we've only got tonight
Not about to let you go
Until the morning light.

Let's dance around this bedroom
Like tonight's our only night
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite.

Dance around the moon,
You and I every night
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite

I cant believe that days took into years
I hate to see the moments disappear
But tonight the sand is stopping
Take the hourglass and drop it
So we can stay
Inside this atmosphere

Dance around the moon,
I'll be your satellite
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite

Dance with me around the moon,
I'll be your satellite
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite

Let's dance around this bedroom,

I just woke up from a dream today
Time gone by but you still look the same
Felt so real to have you back with me
It's just too bad it's just another dream
Give me just one wish

If I could give it all away
I'd do it just for one more day

Well pictures fade and silver turns to grey
But the best of thieves couldn't take my love away
Give me just one wish

If I could give it all away
I'd do it just for one more day
Trade it in for one more moment

Damn it I knew the second that you came up
From underneath the covers say, I wanna meet your mother
Your daddy, your sister and your brother

One week, the time it took you to tell me that you love me
But darling my shit moved across the country
And now we're buying diamonds
Said it's only twenty karats it can't be that hard to find it baby

Your touch has made me a believer
Your love is all I ever needed
And she's the only one I'd follow for eternity

Way to sugar coated you were busy motorboatin'
On that blonde girl

Ain't nothing wrong girl
Looks like we got another come along girl

You know we'll be flying private as long as I can be the pilot baby

Always felt that you
So a custom to the fast life

Sweat pants, hair tie,
Chilling with no make on
That's when your the prettiest

Let's have sexs in my dorm
And I'm a make you beg
Causing you look pretty when you begging
So meet me at the campus

When my album drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy it to and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee

And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love
You the one I lean on,
Feelin' for a fix then you should really get ya fiend on
Yea just kno ma condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back

All up in ya slot until the nigga hit the jackpot [I'm sayin']

You know why? My tears have dried, 
And I know that no weapon formed
Against me will prosper and I truly
Believe that my haters are my motivators.

[Chorus]

If you could you would get rid of me, 
F*** you gone do when a b**** try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard.
If you was as real as me you would never
Let another girl sit in yo throne.
I done put the choke hold on now 
They screamin', ""Nicki leave me alone!""
I am, I'm Still the one to beat.
Ain't in a rush from these streets
I am the streets. I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go, go, go, go hard

Carter called, lemme get the car key, you don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Keep a marquis, everything sparkly (man man down! ) hit em on a walkie-talkie.
Hit em, hit em knock-knock, tell em let me in. my name ring bells b**** buzz me in
And I only stop for pedestrians, or real real bad lesbian.
Hit em wit the Mac, hit em wit the Tech 9, hit em wit the Ruger by the intersex sine. hit em wit a Tommy so my n****s call me Pammy and I always the jammy in the trunk or in the lamby
Put my whole burrough on my back and I'm gooda, I don't wanna hear what you would, what you coulda
I represent all the girls that stood up, used to drink water wit a little bit of sugar.
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups, doin' the scissor-leg on the mat wit my foot up.
Young black pin-up, all of my b****es did up, now I'm tellin' LA Reid to step his bid up.
And I'm tellin' President Carter he picked a winner, b****es like Nelly and Kelly got a dilemma
These birds all fly south in the winter, f*** I look like chompin' on a chicken dinner?
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle; I'ma be a queen no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle, Louis on the duffel. I'm a bad b**** no muzzle. (no muzzle).
B****es is softer than Al Dante, cut from a different kentae. tell em I'm the ninja, 
Weezy is my sensei. so I call him Splinter, faster than a sprinter. gimme my chopsticks
I'll have the rap b****es for dinner.
This is for my gentlemen in button-ups and khakis
This is for my n**** 7-up in Castaki
This is for my n****s wheeling them Kawasakis
Shout out to the back east salt fish eggs
Kisses is to my fans, unless I'm feeling kinda c***y.
Winter Wonderland is on my hand, it's kinda rocky.
I am Nicki, Minaj or Lewinski.
Pumps on the clutch, right hand on the six-speed.
Write my own raps I gotta go, I gotta get me (gotta get me.)
Oh

[Chorus]

If you could you would get rid of me, 
F*** you gone do when a b**** try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard.
If you was as real as me you would never
Let another girl sit in yo throne.
I done put the choke on now 
They screamin', ""Nicki leave me alone!""
I am, I will, I gots to win.
I'm still lookin' around for my
Competition, I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go, go, go, go hard 

From slap-and-cry you start to die, so I must go harder.
Gotta make these b****es know me just like Bobby know water.
Better yet, like Bubba, know shrimp. but he don't say s***
When the gun on his lip, and I don't say s*** put the gun
On my hip. so I don't say s*** but the gun on my hip.
If you don't wanna drown don't come on my ship
Check out how them b****es just run on my dick
And me, I'm that nasty son of a b****.
I still got that b**** cum on my lips
It yee ain got money, don't come on my strip
And if ya got money, don't come on my strip
I wear that metal, no Olympic, but I can still
Make you tumble and flip
You f***in' wit me if you f***in' wit Nick
They ain't f***in' wit me ,they ain't f***in' wit Nick
Your girlfriend and she just split
'cause she wanna f*** me and she wanna f*** Nick
They wonder if he be f***in' Nick, as long as she be f***in' rich
That's why I keep my luggage 'cause, I swear y'all's a f***in' trip.
Young Money Dungeon, b****. my swagger is just punching b****
And I shoot like I'm from over-seas, so call my gun, ""Gunovich""
Weezy F. Baby and the ""F"" is for a bunch of s***
Red drank, blue pill, white dust
Yes I love my country b****.

Wish you could get rid of Young Money, 
F*** you gone do when a b**** try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard.

Nicki Minaj,"Maybe you died 'cause everybody ask me where you at
I try to channel you in hopes that I could stare you back
But its like every intersection we just missed each otha'
You got your fans waitin' tell me you ain't six feet unda'
And tell me that you coming back that you just took a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything that was my mistake
In hindsight I loved your rawness and I loved your edge
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumpin' off the ledge
Your earrings bamboo, your long nails too
Your B.M.W. every time you came through
You was the braveheart
You stole Wayne heart
You never switched it up
You played the same part
But I needed to grow
And I needed to know
That there were some things inside of me that I need to show
So I just deaded you
Left you in all black
But dear old Nicki
Please call back

You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly I believed you
But I'm standing here calling I cant see you
But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that

Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamor
Money, fame and power
'Cause if so that will forever go down my lamest hour
I shoulda kept you with me gettin' at them nameless cowards
There was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess
I had to make them changes, I hope you understood
You see for every bad, I did a ton of good
But you was underground, and I was mainstream
I live the life now, that we would daydream
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me
Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me
The money came yea, tripled and quadrupled it
But I still miss us when we was on some stupid shit
But its still fuck the media
They ridiculed you, never believed in ya
They just deaded you
Left you in all black
But dear old Nicki
Please call back

You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly I believe you
But I'm standing here calling I cant see you

Gave the bitch a ride got the Continental dusty
Trust me I keep a couple hundred in the duff' b
Couple wet wipes in case a bum try to touch me

These little nappy headed hoes need a perminator

Move back bugs, matter fact you know the queen could use a back rub
If you could turn back time, Cher

I wish today it will rain all day
Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away
Trying to forgive you for abandoning me
Praying but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got their guns out aiming at me
But I become Neo when they aiming at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start coming and I start rising
Must be surprising, I'm just surmising
I win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher, more fire

Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocating every time it locks me in
Paintin' they own pictures than they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that can ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
So we become alive in a time of fear
And I ain't got no motherfucking time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard your nay's become yay's

I swear sometimes it feels like it natures me
But to keep it all real is kinda hurtin' me
I could say I'm done with it, but it lurks in me
So I'm a just tell myself that it works for me
Take a real long drive in the Mer-ce-des
And I might pop a couple of them per-ca-ces

And the only thing that change is the price of gold
Even in the afterlife I'm a fight your soul
'Cause the second time around I'll be twice as bold
So do you take me to be who I am?
To have and to hold till death do us part
'Cause if not, it's just best we both part
'Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start?
You got me thinkin' twice to just breathe
Then you say I won't survive if I leave
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve
I no longer need your attention, at ease

It's a joke, it's a game,
Why am I still keeping score?

Brand new tennis chain, fancy pockets on my jeans
Headed for the walk dude, fore' they win him on the stage

Don't I stunt on these bitches? Man I'm bad as a villain
Get the gun, I'ma hunt 'em, when I'm done, I'm a don 'em

Sit that pussy on my bottom lip
Then, after that, you know we gotta switch
My house so big that bitch came with a lobby
We didn't use a rubber, but I came on her body
I lay her down and kiss her neck and talk dirty to her
Like I get that pussy wetter than a dirty sewer
Fuck with me, turn around and bust it open for me
Get on that dick and get that money, go Oprah for me
All you girls don't like me, cause they know you love me
But if you scared, go to church, it's open Sunday
I-I-I dig, I dig in that pussy, guess what I find

Nicki Minaj,"I used to think that we’d run away
One lovely pretty summer day
I remember when you would say
We'd be ok come what may

I never knew you would lie to me
Took everything from inside of me
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away

Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you’ll be young forever
I’ll be over here, you’ll be over there
I’ma shed a tear but I really don’t care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you’ll be young forever

I used to think that we’dExplain reunite
I’d be your wife in the real life
I thought that you’d come back for me
And you would take me away
I never knew only as a teen
You’d reappear only in my dream

Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away

Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you’ll be young forever
I’ll be over here, you’ll be over there
I’ma shed a tear but I really don’t care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you’ll be young forever

This is my last cry
Is this the only way?
This is my own prison
I’m frozen in time, in time, in time

Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine

I remember when I used to stay with Erica
Label transferred 20 million to Comerica
It's fucking terrible, it's got me acting out of character
Young T.O. nigga, either riding range
Or Ferrari top down, screaming, ""Money ain't a thang!""
Tell me when I change, girl, but only when I change
Cause I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game, they know!
Making hits in three acre cribs
Cooking up tryna eat niggas, steak and ribs
I made a couple stars outta basic chicks
Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish
Having good times, making good money
Lot of bad bitches, but they good to me
I make them do the splits for a rap
Wish you niggas good luck, tryna get where I'm at

Momma taught me pride, yeah she did it with the stamps

Somebody tell these local hating niggas, I'm global
Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne going
What I gotta do to get this coconut flowing?
Don't let me hear Shawn Carter, I'm the ballest of the ace
Let me hit up Sean Combs, money cases in my place, let's celebrate

My 24th b-day, I'm sailing to Bermy,
you can see me on a yacht Blasting Pac, little not, I ain't greedy
I'm back to thugging, bitches, back to making them kiss other bitches
My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother sister
I just aspire your desire to be different
My ten year old plan is just one year to finish
My list looks like this, first thing that you'll discover
The difference in pussy: white, black, Latin and other
Here's a man who clearly isn't basic
Waiting list, just to hear me or witness the greatness
Loud laughter while writin' my next chapter
Fast cash life, happily ever after

Nicki Minaj,"He said he came from Jamaica, he owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas ’cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love fucking with them heart breakers
But he was getting money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, bald like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to sing-sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
5-year bid up North when they ratted
Anyway I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat-belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that’s seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I’m Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That’s top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers, I’m in the zone

They holler at me, but it’s you, you, this ain’t high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want, whip it whenever you want
Baby it’s yours
Anywhere, everywhere, baby it’s your world, ain’t it? (alright)
Baby it’s your world, ain’t it?

Uh, she got a nigga at home and one on the side
Best friend is a dyke, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight
I tell her  “make me some money”, she tell me “make me a wife”
I tell that bitch “you crazy, fuck wrong with you?”
And excuse my French, but I’m a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I’m the only one that’s hitting
And I say “what about them niggas?” She say: “what about them niggas?”
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight, don’t judge me, I’d get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I’mma need goggles
She tell me that’s it’s mine, I tell her “stop lying, mine and who else?”
She say worry about yourself Lil Tune

They holler at me, but it’s you, you, this ain’t high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want, whip it whenever you want
Baby it’s yours
Anywhere, everywhere, baby it’s your world, ain’t it?
Baby it’s your world, ain’t it?

I know you want it boy, I see you tryin’
Just keep on pushing, I’mma let you slide in
Just close your eyes and, this horizon

Lewinsky, like I couldn't get the stain out

They diss me, but running and took the same route
Uh, but no, they not nicki, wrist on ice and yes my wrist bricky
If I leave, the game will miss nicki, not a website booking, money, this says 50
Pop bottles with my bitches and get pissy

Nicki Minaj,"Yo, I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
All my life, man, fuck's sake
If I did I did a menage with 'em
And let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a set up for a punchline on duct tape
Worried bout if my butt's fake
Worried 'bout John's singing us Drake
These girls are my sons, John and Kate plus eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dealing with my man on a G5 is my idea of an update
Hut one, hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me even if their name was pop quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with, mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is cutlet
Let it soak in, like seasonin'
And tell 'em, tell 'em blow me, Lance Stephenson

Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

I never fucked Nicki cause she got a man
But when that's over then I'm the first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought god damn, this is the perfect time
We had just come from that video
You know LA traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low key it may be high key
I been peeped that you like me you know
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean it doesn’t take much for us to do this shit quietly, I mean
She say I’m obsessed with thick women and I agree
That’s right I like my girls BBW, yeah
Type to wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
So thick that everyone else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Claire Huxtable
Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh, that’s cause I believe in something, and I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck

If I did fuck she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
Cause she actin' like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story teller
I piss greatness like gold is yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Holly Groove, the holy Mecca
Accountant say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girl from a Bida if she wave
Baby and I fucked with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? I take mothers instead
You got the hickups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp boy, treat me like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses with arm and guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two goons and they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms
This is just crazy my nigga, I mean brazy my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it my nigga
Blood gang take the B, I'll behave ya
I'm niggas is for reals
If you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop, then I take off
Now you see me, now you don't

16 in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with 17 bullets

Nicki Minaj,"Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as 7 years from now, I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was o' six
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I look down, yes I suppose

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

I feel a minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment till it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
(And we know, we know) say fuck the world, we ridin' until the end
I know it's sudden, look at what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it all for you

I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said, he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
'Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know, that I love him
Family ties, broken before me, niggas tryna kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes I get it, I get it, it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

I feel a minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment till it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
(And we know, we know) say fuck the world, we ridin' until the end
I know it's sudden, look at what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it all for you

Let me make this clear I'm not difficult, I'm just about my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I'm love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact
I'd give it all, if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands, why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like, somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say ""We did it!""
My child with Aaron, would've have been sixteen, any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Jee we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writing, this is the Pinkprint

Nicki Minaj,"Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with the python strap
You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mill' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, man, you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
'Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'mma ask on the song

Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And you know how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some
What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked, all along
I'mma ask on the song

So does she know I've been in that bed before?
A thousand count, and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself

Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?

Wow! Westside shorty, with an east side nigga
They say it's levels to this shit, I'm a G5 nigga
And every city I be in, you know she fly with us
It's like Hov got Bey, it's like Bey got Jigga
Really though let me take y'all back
'09, Double R drop top with the top down
Pulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game
It didn't work, got shot down
But I can tell by the bag, by the wrist, by the ring on that
Somebody had it on lockdown
The moral of the story not to speak on that
She on the team, shorty mine now
And we don't ever ever ever make love
And we don't ever ever ever say ""love""
Unless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that D on that, I don't ever say uh
Bad bitch, ain't nothin' made up

Rahmeek, I'mma have to tell the truth if I speak
Unless you want to play, you ain't say this the other day
You said she was in love, and I still didn't budge
'Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
(I'm not even sure if this is right but, that feels good)

I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me

He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo

'Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us

But when you're away I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I'm not the one and you're wasting your time

(But you waited)

Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged

We was just planning a wedding, caught cagin' doves
You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs

Do you need someone? Is it too late to talk?
Did I wait too long?

Where it ain't no easy cash, you got to use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not 'cause I hate ya
Not 'cause I wanna, guess I wanna imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?

Nicki Parrott,"Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?
Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.
Here is the gist, a practical list of ""donts"" for you.

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.
Sweetheart they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't dance all night with me

It's wonderful, so they say
And with the moon up above, it's wonderful

I know I've never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand, and
The thing that's known as romance
Is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

To leave your house some morning
And without any warning, you're stopping people,
Shouting that love is grand, and
To hold a man in your arms is wonderful, wonderful

No preguntemos al final solo sabe Dios

Me tienes enamorado 
Atracción fatal que me hace devorarte como un animal 
Como quisiera ayudarte a olvidar tu pasado 
Pero me lo haz negado 
Solo déjame entrar y vas a ver que al final te va a gustar 

Nos vamos pal oscuro mama 
Tenemos tu y yo las mismas fuertes ganas 
Hagamoslo despacio pa' matar las ganas 
Pa' comerte completa y sin que quede nada 
Olvida la casualidad y aprovecha mama 
Dame la oportunidad y deja que te lo haga 
Pa' subir la intensidad hasta por la mañana 
Matemos curiosidad aquí junto en mi cama

Para que le haga lo que nunca a sentido

I can't forget 
The day you left you the air I breathe
My life was in your kiss
My breath in your lips
So how do I live?
If baby you're the air I breathe
('Cause baby you're the air I breathe, oh no)

Oye mami
We can't help without feeling you want me
Holding the pillow I'm pretending is your body
Is like I'm drowning underwater with my insights
This the kind of pain that makes a man cry
Holding it and keeping it cool
So I be steady on my wreck I keep my mind over you
But it ain't working, I'm missing you like a drug
Is like I can't get back the air of my lungs
That's why I'm telling

No matter how far
Wherever you are
I'm waiting for you
I don't wanna, I don't wanna let go

So if the world is getting heavy
And you feel the need to call me
Never doubt it

If I had a chance to bring you back to me
I would do it in a heartbeat

Nicky Thomas,"Hoverin' by my suitcase
Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain a fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'
""It's all right""

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just got to do your own thing

I find me a place in a box car
So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I'm all right

As I packed my bags to leave
Thought she would start to cry
Stood around on my room and grieve

Y'all, the girl, she fooled me this time
She acted like I was the last thing on her mind
Girl, I'd like to start all over again

Baby, can I change my mind?

As I took those steps
Towards that open door
Knowing all the time
Oh, Lord, I just didn't wanna go

She didn't give me no sign
Nothing that would make me change my mind
Now, I'd like to start all over again

Baby, can I change my mind?
Please, please, please baby
I just wanna change my mind

Lord, I played my games
Many times before
But peoples, let me tell y'all
Oh, I never reached the door

Cool wind is [Incomprehensible] tonight
Keep lookin' back but my baby was not in sight
And I'd like to start all over again

Baby, let me change my mind
Feeling gloomy, baby
That's how I can't change my mind

Nicky Thomas,"Lola
I met her in a club down in old Soho,
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like cherry-cola,
C-O-L-A cola,
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance,
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola,
L-O-L-A Lola la-la-la-la Lola

Well I'm not the world's most physical guy,
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine,
Oh my Lola la-la-la-la Lola.

Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand,
Why she walked like a woman and talked like a man,

Well we drank champagne and danced all night,
Under electric candlelight,
She picked me up and sat me on her knee,
And said dear boy won't you come home with me,

Well I'm not the world's most passionate guy,
But when I looked in her eyes well I almost fell for my Lola,

I pushed her away,
I walked to the door,
I fell to the floor,
I got down on my knees,
Then I looked at her and she at me,
Well that's the way that I want it to stay,
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola.

Well I left home just a week before,
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before,
But Lola smiled and took me by the hand,
And said dear boy I'm gonna make you a man.

Girls will be boys and boys will be girls,
It's a mixed up muddled up shook up world except for Lola,",Lola

Can't sleep at night always think about you
But if I had the chance to start all over
I would be wishing today on a four leaf clover
And leaving you with the last thing on my mind
If I could turn back the hands of time

Oh darling I can't hold out much longer
Oh the pain's so deep and the hurt is getting stronger
But if I had just one more try
I would be yours, yours alone until the day I die
and we would have a love so divine
If I could turn back the hands of time

Oh darling please, please let me come back home

If someone could hold you now
If fate could play a different hand
All if all the broken hearts
Could be fixed not torn apart

Watching shadows on the wall
Some questions are impossible
And does God make a fool of us all
Watch the skies as sadness falls

Bits of me don't exist anymore
I can't replace what's been and gone
Cars and bits of silhuettes
Buy some time and learn to dance

Time comes too soon for you
Memories left to date and bruise
No control we're all at sea
In a world that's dissappeared

Broken scremas can kill you dreams
I wish I knew more about your fears
And if I could your eyes I would kiss
And fill up your time with laziness

Lets declare an amnesty
Ambitions dead for all to sea
Shake your fists we've grown too fast
Help me love and hold me close
Twist and turn so wonderful
Break your bones I'm coming home

If someone could hold you now
If someone could hold you now
Hold you now",Bobby Untitled
Nicky Wire,"""It's scary to watch someone you love go into the center of himself and confront his fears...
Fear of failure, fear of death, fear of going insane
You have to fail a little, die a little, go insane a little to come out the other side.""

Break my heart slowly
Dora Maar said to me
She came to me in a dream
Reaching out full up with fear

She said:
""Hold on, hold on, hold on to your gun""

It was cold, the night was black
You could feel her freezing hands
Exiting a life of chance
Painted dead a million times

She said:
""Hold on, hold on, hold on to your gun""

She said:
""If your life has changed
If it makes no sense
You can carry on if you still belong
If your life has changed
If it makes no sense

Nothing stays 
Tied to a place

Frozen not dead

Need somebody to help me through

It's no bad thing
Trusting aside
To what can we cling

Need a stranger to show me the the truth
Need somebody to help me through
In our decline we've ebbed and we've flowed
Nothing gained and nothing to show

Everything fades
O glorious day
However we try
You can't hold back time

Failure can
Be good for your soul
It tests your desires
And leaves you alone

Need someone something somehow
Serves to remember you as you are
Need too shelter you from the storm
Need a place that I can call home

Like a prayer I can hear, hear you calling
Like a prayer I can hear you calling out for me

The angry and blazing circus of sun
Blasphemes as the crown prince arises.

You cannot beget all the sins that you owe
To the people of paradise magic
Pretend to answer passion and form
With foreign rationalizations.

Primroses are the jewels that lurk
Among masks of pleasure that flicker with doubt
Embraces of fame that's simultaneously fear
To advance and demand to be recognized.

The river shall flow through hollow green faces
Of caricature's resentment etched out of the tongues.

Titanic curses trap me in

Symbols vanish from my senses

Vanish from my glance

I enforce a strike the alarm
For the various defences
That choose to be here and there
And lose the direction everywhere

In a Nibelungen land where we cannot be
Almond trees grow along the mountain trail
From their tongues the words are spelling
The telling numb

I cannot hear it anymore
I cannot hear it anymore

Since the first of you and me here and there
We lose the direction everywhere
Shrieking city sun shiver in my veins
In flames I run
In flames I run
Waiting for the sign to come

Will you spell the words for me to hear

Nico & Vinz,"I used to pray every night when I was younger
On my knees, folding hands for my mother
And my mother used to say when she was younger
She used to go to bed filled with hunger
The same hunger got her working even harder
Got her travelling to Norway from Ghana
She said ""My son, we're blessed, now let's say Our Father""
Ups and downs, that's how life go
What's high if you don't know low?
So I try not to complain
Appreciate life so I keep saying

Another day goes by, another day goes by
And I thank God that I'm alive
Another day goes by, another day goes by
And I thank God that I'm alive

I think I was about ten years old
Watching the news with my dad
I didn't see nothing but tears and blood
And a bunch of people looking so mad
""That's war"", I was told
I said ""How? That ain't nothing like the games I have""
I couldn't grasp the sense of an innocent child
Dying by the hands of a grown man
And while some kids raised on cartoons
Young girls making money in dark rooms
We all deserve a decent meal
Why his belly so soft, why she holding that hard spoon?
And where is my head of state?
If crime pays, talk peace, still engage in heavy arms trade
In the jungle that we call Sin City
While life rules, survival of the fittest

Another day goes by, another day goes by
And I thank God that I'm alive
Another day goes by, another day goes by

Breaking hour after hour, man, I never let it go

I never had girls running everywhere I go
I'm telling you this just to let you know that
I believe it's all within us, reach to where it's at uh

It don't have to be miracles, oh
The fire's within your soul
You don't have to be big and tall, oh
Just stand up and know your role
So we say ah

I told my little brother keep on doing what you love
To make it on the field is what he's been dreaming of
So never stop evolving even though you know you're blessed
Make sure that your next day will always be your best, oh
it's not a magic trick that'll get you there
The only miracle cure is blood, sweat and tears
The road is rocky, but don't you ever go astray
You'll bring home a trophy if you walk it all the way

It don't have to be miracles, oh
The fire's within your soul
You don't have to be big and tall, oh
Just stand up and know your role
So we say ah

What is far can be so close

What are we fighting for
When hopes are on the floor?
I'm broken in pieces
Got a war in the rooms of my heart
Now I can see it
It's time to pack it up and fold the cards
I try not to need it
But the reality kicks in hard
When hearts stop beating
You gotta leave it

The more you turned right back around

Sometimes you got to say

And you 
You're sitting on the bathroom floor 
Drawing pictures 
Making sure it doesn't even show 
But your mother's calling on the phone again 
What you going to say now that it got so late ?

One day you will wake up 
And everything that you thought you would be 
Will be standing there staring right back at you 
And I guess I should have said so 
But I swear I didn't even know how to feel about it 
When it walked right out on you 

And there's a nervous calling running through the walls 
And it's getting louder now 
It's begging you to please 
You know that slow thing humming at the other side of skin
It's what you listen to 
When you run out of you

So I hope
I hope you really get it now 
'cause there's a reason why you keep on running out of time 
And I just seen it crawling under your skin

Immer wenn du tickst, Avi bleib ich cool
und feuer dir Sprüche zurück, quasi 3, 6,0

Wir sind Kumpels und ich will nur, dass du ahnst
dass ich immer nur das Beste will für dich und deine Mum

Ich bin sicher nicht perfekt, 
Nicht mal wenn ich rapp, fühl mich streng 
wenn ich dir sagen muss, ich bin hier der Chef aber

Ich mein's gut mit dir und bring dich auf den richtigen 
damit du auf sie aufpasst, wenn ich irgendwann mal nicht mehr bin

Deine Mama ist die treueste Seele die ich kenn'
Vergiss das nicht, sollten eure Wege sich mal trenn'

Kleiner Zwerg was geht ab?
Aus dir wird sicher mal ein Guter, einer mehr in der Stadt
Und das feier ich so krass, deshalb sing' ich es laut
Auf dich ist verlass, wenn deine Stimme mal brauch

Komm sing mit mir, sing mit mir ?
Komm sing mit mir, sing mit mir ?

Ah, ich bin nicht fehlerfrei und ohne Marke
wenn ich so wie jetzt mit Zigarette durch die Wohnung latsche.

Sorry, doch du kriegst davon nichts mit
wie von der ganzen schei*e die an jeden Tag, gibt

Du stehst auf Fußball, ich auf Benjamin und Biene Maja,
Ich steh dir zur Seite, mal als Spielberater wie dein Vater

Du hast Talent, am Anfang war nicht alles easy, aber
Du hast dich durchgekämpft wie Avatar und Peter Parker

Du stehst auf Zeichentrick, Star Wars 
und dabreaker moves, abgeranzte Skatershoes 
und findest die Lakers cool

Genauso wie, zocken auf der Wii
Wenn deine Mum und ich wieder am Wochenende spielen 

Der King of Pop macht auf einmal wieder Sinn
Wenn ich sehe wie du strahlst
Wenn wir Michae, Lieder sing

Und die meisten Kinder klingen nicht im Ansatz wie du
Deshalb leih mir deine Stimme, weil du kannst das so gut

Komm sing mit mir, sing mit mir ?
Komm sing mit mir, sing mit mir ?


Es dauert nicht mehr lang' dann kommst du in die Pubertät
Bleib so wie du bist, wie dir's kehrt was dir super steht

Und wenn man interessiert an neuen Dingen
ich hoffe dass wir auch in 20 Jahren gute Freunde sind

Ich wünsch mir, dass wir für immer miteinander klar kommen, kein Plan 
ob's klappt dafür fehlt mir die Erfahrung.

Mit dem Blick nach oben schau in die Ferne
Über mir leuchten tausende Sterne
Komm nach Hause wie gerne
Hätte ich dich auch auf der Erde
Aber das ist leider nicht machbar
Ich frag mich stopfst du
Noch ab und zu die Pfeife mit Tabak oder rockst du
Immer noch wie auf Bildern 'n Hut wie ein Cowboy
Erinner' mich wieder an so viele Dinge

Kein Plan wie es dir geht
Kein Plan wo du steckst
Paps kann es sein das du mit mir sprichst wenn ich schlafe
Kann es sein das du mich beschützt all die Jahre

Weil du Tag und Nacht auf mich aufpasst
Wie ich auf mein eigenes Baby
Ich werd' da sein wenn mein Kind aufwacht
Du bist da für mich wenn ich flach lieg'
Der mir Kraft und der auf mich acht gibt
Der einzige Beweis das Engel existieren
Der wenn ich falle der mir sagt ich hab dich
Fakt ist ich hab's in Kauf zu nehmen
Du bist nicht hier hast dich entschieden mir voraus zu gehen
Doch zu dir auf zusehen ist der Grund warum ich noch bleibe

Wie der Vater so der Sohn
Ich scheue den Vergleich
Du hast dich nie geschont und
Ich schone mich so leicht
Weil ich denke ich bin fertig
Du dachtest jetzt erst recht
Es gab immer was zu tun
Vater was tust du nun

Ich will dir noch einmal danke sagen
Ich will dir nochmal danke sagen
Dich nochmal zu sehen wäre das größte Geschenk
Immer wenn ich an dich denk' genau in diesem Moment

Du bringst Farbe in mein Leben wie ein Regenbogen
Fühl mich wie ein Engel ohne Flügel auf dem Weg nach oben
Schweb auf Wolke 8, immer wenn ich dich auf der Straße sehe
Du bist wie das Meer und ich würde gern in dir baden gehen
Dein Körper ist ein Wunderland, ich geh auf Entdeckungsreise
Wenn ich wie ein aufgeweckter Schmetterling dein Bett umkreise

Es gibt tausend gute Gründe dir ein Lied zu singen
Doch keines meiner Worte kann beschreiben wie verliebt ich bin
Ich hätte Lust dich über die Schwelle ins Bett zu tragen
Und alle Probleme wären auf der Stelle wie weggeblasen
Vögel fangen an zu singen, Wolken ziehen in Herzenform
Über meinen Kopf hinweg, es kommt mir wie ein Märchen vor
Was soll ich sagen, wie soll ich's dir nur beschreiben?
Jetzt wenn Worte deinen Kopf verlassen klingt es wie ein Streichquartett

Wir zwei sind wie die „Schöne und das Biest“
Irgendwo gestrandet im Paradies
Das mit uns ist wie ein Trip nach Paris
Ein frei-Flug ins All, flüster ich dir leise ins Ohr
Wir zwei sind wie Julia und Romeo
Und endlich fallen die Steine wie beim Domino
Wir machen zwanzig Kinder mindestens, sowieso
Komm, wir ham noch einiges vor

Nico Suave,"Ist es nicht ironisch, dass der größte Hit den ich schrieb ""Vergesslich"" war
Bei all den Augenblicken die so unvergesslich waren - unvergesslich sind?
Denn ich weiß immer noch wie Samy rappt, dass seine Mom Weed aus seinem Zimmer roch'
Mit Ill Will bei Super Mario im vierten Stock
Drei Monate später im Radio, denn sie spielten's doch. Es ging ziemlich Flop
Ich wusste nicht viel über's Musikgeschäft, doch ich hielt wie Max an meiner Liebe fest
Vergesse nie das Flash, nie das Splash
Nie die Leute die mich supported haben, so wie mein Dad
Pause bitte!
All die Augenblicke rauschen vorbei. Ein Mic, zwei Plattenspieler, Dreißigtausend die schreien
Ich vertraute auf mein Glück
Es zerbrach in tausend Stücke, doch ich bau's immer wieder neu zusammen
Manchmal schau' ich kurz zurück, denn es wär' nicht wie es ist
Wär' es damals nicht gewesen wie es war
Unvergesslich

Jedes Mal wenn ich kurz zurückblick, stell ich fest, dass es kein Zurück gibt
Manchmal lach' ich drüber, doch dann merk' ich wieder, wieder
Manchmal lach' ich drüber, doch dann merk' ich wieder wie's mich trifft

Jedes Mal wenn ich kurz zurückblick, stell ich fest, dass es kein Zurück gibt
Manchmal lach' ich drüber, doch dann merk' ich wieder, wieder
Manchmal lach' ich drüber, doch dann merk' ich wieder wie's mich trifft

Irgendwie seltsam, dass der größte Hit den ich je schrieb ""vergesslich"" war
So viele Momente, die unvergesslich waren - unersetzlich sind
Ich denk' oft dran: Mit den Blumentöpfen und klugen Köpfen wie Dendemann
Wochenlang auf Tour. Ich verfluchte es zu jobben
Zwischen Schuhen und Klamotten auf der Suche nach den Flocken
Deshalb musste ich's wie Eizi tun, ""rulen bis zum Schluss""
Denn ""ein Fuchs muss tun, was ein Fuchs tun muss""
Natürlich war nicht immer alles Rosé wie Rick Ross
Und nicht alles wofür ich heute steh' ist HipHop
Im Grunde genommen ist alles okay
Denn alles was ich erlebt habe, kann mir heutzutage keiner mehr nehm'
Ich vertraute auf mein Glück
Es zerbrach in tausend Stücke, doch ich bau's immer wieder neu zusammen
Manchmal schau' ich kurz zurück, denn es wär' nicht wie es ist
Wär' es damals nicht gewesen wie es war
Unvergesslich

Jedes Mal wenn ich kurz zurückblick, stell ich fest, dass es kein Zurück gibt
Manchmal lach' ich drüber, doch dann merk' ich wieder, wieder
Manchmal lach' ich drüber, doch dann merk' ich wieder wie's mich trifft

Jedes Mal wenn ich kurz zurückblick, stell ich fest, dass es kein Zurück gibt
Manchmal lach' ich drüber, doch dann merk' ich wieder, wieder
Manchmal lach' ich drüber, doch dann merk' ich wieder wie's mich trifft

Die erste Eins in der Schule
Die ersten kleinen Versuche zu rappen wie damals Biggie und Pun. Unvergesslich!
Die schwerste Zeit meiner Jugend, die erste eigene Bude. Ich weiß noch genau wie alles begann
Das ganze Alben-Gestresse, der lange Fall auf die Fresse, das Jammern auf wirklich hohem Niveau. Unvergesslich!
Das Bo, die Beginner und Sam, ich bleib' für immer ein Fan
Peace an die Töpfe und Eins, Zwo. Unvergesslich!

Jedes Mal wenn ich kurz zurückblick, stell ich fest, dass es kein Zurück gibt
Manchmal lach' ich drüber, doch dann merk' ich wieder, wieder
Manchmal lach' ich drüber, doch dann merk' ich wieder wie's mich trifft

Jedes Mal wenn ich kurz zurückblick, stell ich fest, dass es kein Zurück gibt
Manchmal lach' ich drüber, doch dann merk' ich wieder, wieder
Manchmal lach' ich drüber, doch dann merk' ich wieder wie's mich trifft

Nico Suave,"Die meisten Leute die ich kenne
Wollen Schulabschlüsse
Kinder machen
Haus und Boot
Ich will lieber Fußabdrücke hinterlassen
Auf dem Mond
Deshalb laufe ich
Streife durch das Hinterland
Pausenlos
Seit ich meine Schleife selber binden kann
Nenn mich einen Freiheitsliebenden
Einen Getriebenen
Meinetwegen einen Fliehenden
Auf Hip-Hop hängen gebliebenen
Schon Run DMC sagten zu mir
""Walk this Way""
Ich brauch kein festen Wohnsitz
Ich wohn in der Hall of Fame
Hoffentlich machen meine Sneaker nie schlapp
Wenn das Reisefieber mich packt
Denn dann bin ich schnell auf der Stelle hier weg
Verlass gleich schon wieder die Stadt
Ich hab gerade eben erneut hinter mir die Türe zugeklatscht
Neue Schuhe brauchen Bewegung
Dafür sind sie gemacht
Ich muss gehen

Keep on walking if you got that Blues
Put on your Sneakers or the blue sweat shoes
Keep on (Walking)

Keep on Walking
(Hey hang on)

I keep on walking in my walking shoes
This is the time when the soul hangs loose
Keep on (Walking)
Walking (Walking)
Walking (Walking)
I keep on Walking

Yeah
Für einen Bürojob Nine to Five
Hab ich leider keine Zeit
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
Es ist fast so als wäre meine Nummer 110
Oder 112
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
Egal ob ich das Nike Zeichen
Drei Streifen, Chucks oder Rebook rock
Meine Sneaker kleben mir an den Fersen
Wie die Cops
Tragen meine Beine
Schützen mich vor dem tiefsten Frost
Immer wenn ich in die große weite Welt zieh
(zieh)
Wie so oft
Ist es für mich selbst ein Wunder
Wie ich in der Welt rumlunger
Laufend am laufen
Nenn mich meinetwegen nen Weltenbummler
Hab grad erst wieder meine Türe zugeklatscht

Nein ich bleib nicht stehen
Ich bin so lange schon am gehen
Ich hab entzündete Achillessehnen
Was auch immer vor mir liegt
Ich will es sehen
Und jeder Schritt tut weh
Aber scheinbar sehn ich mich nicht nach einem neuen Leben
So wie Frauen die die Pille nehmen
Und ich wähl nie den Mittelweg
Nie den Ausweg
Nie den gleichen Weg
Ich such meinen Weg
Und wenn er mal nicht weiter geht
(Bam bam ba bam)
Bin ich mein eigenes Straßenbauamt
Hab an meinen Füßen soviel Blasen oh man
Oh manchmal mags so aussehen als ob
Mir die Luft ausgeht
Doch ganz genau dann
Werde ich noch schneller
Und ich rappe Acapella
Und ich wette diese Rapper bleiben vor mir steh'n
Ich will allen hier beweisen das da noch mehr geht
Guck so wie ich meine Hacken in Teer tret
Packe Metaphern in Takte
Fucke die andern nie ab
Ich paffe die Cannabispflanze
Nein ich mache nicht schlapp
Egal ob breit wie'n Sumo
High wie'n UFO
Der Boden ist immer direkt unter meinen Schuhsohlen
Und ich
Geh soviel darum sind da Löcher drin
Und der Weg ist das Ziel
Und da möchte ich hin
Und wenn auch ihr
Nie stehenbleibt
Dann solltet ihr den Song noch öfter's hören

Like a desert wind through a cloudless sky
No relief from the heat, no shade I find
No sign of water, but the tears I've cried

So I will go to Jacob's well
To fill my cup with living water
From the stream that has no end
And I will thirst again no more

It's a long hard journey, all the pain it brings
Try to quench my yearnings with material things
But I'm only wondering through a wilderness
My soul's still searching for a place to rest

So I will go to Jacob's well
And fill my cup with living water
From the stream that has no end
And I will thirst again no more

I'm telling you, you will never thirst again
Don't listen to the lies going through your head
Nothing else is going to satisfy
Drink the water that will bring you life

I thought I put you behind me
Told you that I never want to see you again

Bite like a viper, venom to my heart
You've been lying and waiting
To tear my peaceful world apart

Don't you know that you're not invited
But you keep on coming back

No, oh no, not you again
You're the person I used to be
Got to stop you in your tracks

Preying on my weakness
You want to kick me when I'm down
I don't like what I'm seeing
I'm myself when you're around

It?s an all too familiar feeling
These memories from the past

But I'm getting? nowhere fast

How did my heart become so lifeless and cold
Where did the passion go?

When all my efforts seem like chasing wind
I've used up all my strength and there's nothing left to give
I've lost the feeling and I'm numb to the core
I can't fake it anymore.

Here I am at the end I'm in need of resurrection
Only You can take this empty shell and raise it from the dead
What I've lost to the world what seems far beyond redemption
You can take the pieces in Your hand and make me whole again, again

You speak and all creation falls to its knees
You raise Your hand and calm the waves of the raging sea
You have a way of turning winter to spring
Make something beautiful out of all this suffering

Here I am once again I'm in need of resurrection
Only You can take this empty shell and raise it from the dead
What I've lost to the world what seems far beyond redemption
You can take the pieces in Your hand and make me whole again, again

Nicola Di Bari,"Si tu buscas un ser bueno no vengas a mi, 
Por que no tengo esta virtud, 
Si lo buscas rico fascinante no soy yo... 
Yo no he triunfado un solo día de mi vida. 
No darás jamás tu mano a un tipo como yo 
Ni por supuesto el corazón, 
Por que escucho los sentidos no los sentimientos, 
Así que niña no te enfades por que te diga la verdad. 
Se que bebo, se que fumo, se juego y hasta en el amor 
Se que soy un egoísta, un inconsciente, prepotente 
y en la vida como en el amor. 
Vendrá a caso el día en que cualquiera escribirá 
Palabras bellas sobre mi... 
Cualquier chica hablara de mi con ilusión, 
Se mezclaran abrazos flores y mentiras. 
No mas lagrimas ni te preocupes mas de mi.. 
Por que muy alto volaré. 
Yo he embrollado tanto que hasta a EL yo le mentí.. 
Que es perfectísima bondad, pero aun me puede perdonar, 
Se que bebo se que fumo se juego y hasta en el amor 
Se que soy un egoísta, un inconsciente, 
prepotente y en la vida como en el amor. 
Y una nube que vuela baja y vuela va, 
Va y me envuelve sin sentir, 
Y me arrastra sobre la montaña siempre azul, 
Mis pies cansados no los siento ya... 
Yo no quiero ya volver de nuevo que me importa, 
Me avergonzaré de mí 
Mas la cosa que me diga nuestra tierra si... 
Es la voz tuya que me llama, enamorada cual jamás 
Se que bebo se que fumo se juego y hasta en el amor 
Se que soy un egoísta, un inconsciente 
prepotente y en la vida como en el amor. 
Se que bebo se que fumo se juego y no me arrepiento 
Antes recomenzaré.... 
He embrollado a medio mundo a todos siempre he mentido 
Aun que nadie lo haya sabido por que la única lo has sido tu, 
Yo comprendo que he luchado como muchos la vida.. 
Y a la postre siempre solo he pagado una lagrima de mas.

As you sail away to dreamland
High above the moon you hear a silvery note

Parfois des années.
Si t'avais pas de tripes,
Ta boutique, eux,
Pouvaient la fermer

Et Trenet avait mis des années,
Brassens commençait à emballer
Et Bécaud astiquait son clavier.
Monsieur Brel ne parlait pas encore des folles
Et mon père venait de débarquer
Là où restait quelque humanité,
Là où les gens savaient encore parler
De l'avenir... même s'ils sont fatigués.

Et Juliette avait encore son nez,
Aragon n'était pas un minet.
Sartre était déjà bien engagé.

Nicole,"No pasa nada allá afuera
Y dentro de ti, mil cosas suceden
Sientes que el tiempo no espera
Te pierdes no sabes por donde comenzar

Momento de incertidumbre
Preguntas que quedan sin contestar
Esperas que se iluminen tus pasos
Y que algo toque profundo tu corazón

Días, de melancolía y sueños
De conversación en silencio
Días que cambian otros días
Donde descubres algo más

Una batalla constante
Entre lo que eres capaz y la
Inseguridad
Los errores se enfrentan con miedo
Y el ego que muerde confunde
La razón

Y el cielo cambia sin verlo
En esta confusión y la falta de ilusión
Y en un respiro se encuentra el alivio
Que calma y que te hace salir a continuar

And if we knew just what we could do
A cemetery song we'd not sing

I used to love it
It used to be pretty
I'll come down, walk around a while
Until I'm sure I can never go home again

I could learn to love the landscape I was born to
By the river in the rain

I've been to the front lines
And now there's no trace of hope left inside

I cracked when I tried to press my luck
Hoping you'd come pick me up

Take me back to the Rocking Horse, pray for answers

Don't leave your lover waiting all night by the window

But this midnight horoscope
It tells me there's a little more hope

Inside the rocks and stone, spaces became our home

When the light finally dies and we look to the sky
Will we finally know why
They call the dawn morning
And I wish we'd said goodbye

Years flying by, trapped all alone in the sky
And you stories down and all of our loved ones outside
Our words turned out all wrong
Intentions lost in halls
Now all I want to do is tear down the walls
Searching for words for the end
But we built the tower too high

When the light finally dies and we look to the sky
Will we finally know why
They call the dawn the morning, and I wish we'd said goodbye

Seems like the final day you'll ever come my way
So please forgive me if I hold on too tight, too tight

Their bullet's the bomb
Their bullet's disease

My bullet's to grow
Penniless and old
I take all I can get
Until I'm dirt and bones

Take all they want now they lick from a bone

I can disappear from who I'd like to be

For your nocturnal tongue to tell me I am found

Go on out and change the world and become

And as the tears that she was cryin'
Fell from her face and shoulders, she said

When she tells me that it's time to soar
And I don't know what I'm will do
Not sure what I'm gonna tell her

Maybe, don't forget who you are, child

About the letting go of those we wanna hold
So tightly to, but somehow we know they must move on
On for those who have a dream to make our future better and

On for those who will earn their wings
In spite of wind and weather you tell 'em love is waiting there
Forever in their corner, so with every bow they take
They'll take one for those that came before them

Looking for some ladies and some young men
To run the race and endure to the very end
No turning back, no quitting if you're gonna win
Your mark, get set, running like a champion
Have you heard the story about Joshua?
He was young, strong, and courageous
Not by power nor was it by might my friend
""But by my Spirit,"" that's what the Lord says

I believe God is calling you my friend
To shake your world upside-down and back again
Might be a hundred you might just be a little kid
But you can slay giants just the way that David did
I remember times when it was difficult
And I prayed that God would send a miracle
I don't know how but right up to the very end
He made a way outta' ""no-way"" and show enough delivered

Sling shot in my back pocket track 
Bumping with a rocket 
Battle rocks by my side
Ready for Apocalypse
Even these inventions unseen but heard
Not by power or might but by my spirit says the Word
And who can be against us if you for us(nobody)
And who can shut us down if you with us(nobody)
And who can stop a thing that you started(nobody)
If you with us, put 'em up and be a witness

Nicole C. Mullen,"A teenage girl, a Nazarite
Who loves Yahweh and does what's right
Is visited by an angel

She's terrified, mystified
'Till he clarifies that he's here to prophesize
And says, ""Fear not
You who are highly favorite of God
The Lord is with you""

Still Mary was greatly troubled by his words
(Christmas in black and white)
And wondered what kind of greeting this might be
And he said, ""Do not be afraid, Mary
For you have found favor with God?

You will be with child, and will give birth to a son
And you are to call His name Jesus
(Christmas in black and white)
He will be great, He will be called the Son of the Most High
Mary replied, ""How can these things be
Since I have not yet been with a man?""

The angel answered and said
""The Holy Spirit shall come upon you
And the power of the Most High shall shower you
So the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God?

Even Elizabeth, your relative
Is going to have a child in her old age
And she who is said to be barren is in her sixth month

Nicole C. Mullen,"Been ostracized for 12 years
I'm used to being alone
Spent everything I had
And now it's gone
I'm used to being put down
My issues tell it all
My only hope is anchored
In this fall

If I could just touch the hem of His garment
I know I'd be made whole
If I could just press my way through this madness
His love would heal my soul
If only one touch

So many people calling 
How could He ever know
That just a brush of Him 
Would stop the flow
If He knew would He rebuke me
Or shame me to the crowd
Well I'm desperate 'cause it's never or it's now

If I could just touch the hem of His garment
I know I'd be made whole
If I could just press my way through this madness
His love would heal my soul.

And then suddenly He turned around
He said somebody has unleashed my power
Well, frightened and embarrassed I bowed
You see I told Him of my troubles 
And how

I had to touch the Hem of His garment
And I know I've been made whole
And how I had pressed my way through this madness
And His love has healed my soul.

Then with one word He touched the hem of my garment
And you know I've been made whole
And somehow He pressed His way through my madness
And His love has healed my soul.


I tell you He Touched me.
He reached way down and touched me
When no one else would touch me
Jesus shol' 'nough (sure enough) He touched me
And I know I've been made whole",One Touch (Press)
Nicole C. Mullen,"He?s never been scared of hard work
So why are his hands trembling
And how could something so small
Be all so weighty
On the scales of what could be

This tiny seed has potential
For a better way of life
And how he sows it is crucial
For his little ones, his wife

Chorus
So he prays to the Lord of the harvest
Would you rain down on the least of these
Would you please multiply and divide them
These are my sharecropper seeds
These are my Sharecropper seeds

It yielded more, than he?d ever hoped for
Enough to take care of things
?Til the landowner came and said, ?I want more?
And gave him less than agreed

Chorus
So he cry to the Lord of the harvest
Please remember the least of these
Would you shine on my sons, and my daughters
Cause these are my sharecropper seeds
These are my Sharecropper seeds


So Bring me, my flowers
While I can see them
So that I will know the beauty that they bring, that they bring

Stories like these told to me from my mother
Of my grandpa and them back when
She said, most of the good crops, today that I, was reaping
Were sown in love by them

So I?m praising the Lord of the harvest
For remembering the least of these
And I?m proud of the title I?m wearing
?Cause I am Sharecropper seed.
Yeah I am the lest of these
God still cares for the least the sharecropper?s seed

Looked his papa in the eyes 
And said I really need to talk with you
Been thinkin bout a lot of things
What it is I want to be
And superman I'm thinkin 
Just won't do.

(chorus)
When I grow up I want to be
When I grow up I want to be when I grow up I want to be
Like you.

the score is 33 to 9
His high school team is way behind
He felt defeated till his papa came
Remember if you win or lose
I'm always 
Gon be proud of you
You're my favorite champion of 
The game.

he came to the door to say goodnight
Stopped at a familiar sight
Papa was kneelin down to pray
""dear father god up above
Thanks for showin me love""
Then quietly he heard his papa say

Nicole C. Mullen,"Spoken:
I dream of being a doctor.
I dream of being a pilot.
I dream of being a soccer player.
I dream of being a basketball player.
I dream of being a pastor.
I dream of being a race car driver.
I dream of becoming a teacher.


His momma said here's
Some fish and bread. There's
Just enough to get you by.
It's not a lot, but
It's all that we've got.
Then a tear came to her eye.

And she took it, blessed it,
As she looked up to the sky.
She said, ""Take it and share it.
I pray it will be multiplied""

It was so little. There were so many
To feed them all would take so much.
But He didn't laugh when the boy gave Him
What He knew was not enough

So Jesus took it and blessed it
And all the love that filled His eyes
When He held it and broke it
'Cause only then it multiplied

So I said ""Take it, bless it, hold it,
Break it, Break it, Break it""

Messed up and wounded
Undone and yielded
I offer up this sacrifice
It's not a lot but
It's all I've got
What can You do with such a life?

Then Jesus took it and blessed it
And all the love that filled His eyes
When He held it and broke it
'Cause only then I multiplied

See Jesus took me and blessed me
And all the love that filled His eyes
When He held me and broke me
'Cause only then I multiplied

So I say change me and please bless me
Lord please hold me and please break me
I know You'll take me and I'm asking You to bless me
And Lord please hold me and I know You're gonna,
You're gonna break me

And I'll multiply
I'll multiply (x4)

You don't have to think about me
Doing somebody else
If you really want me to be your baby
Then you gotta stop actin' crazy

It's like strawberries, strawberries
Sometimes you're bitter, sometimes you're sweet
I feel the same way about you and me

Like strawberries, strawberries
Sometimes you're bitter, sometimes you're sweet
I feel the same way about you and me

Like strawberries, strawberries
Sometimes you're bitter, sometimes you're sweet
I feel the same way about you and me

Like strawberries, strawberries
Sometimes you're bitter, sometimes you're sweet
I feel the same way about you and me

Nicole Renee,"You know sometimes we ummm, 
We don't recognize our dreams inside
Our reality and uh other times 
We're not aware of exactly
What's real ya know we walk around day dreaming But the sunshine, the sunshine always is, and I

[Chorus]
I just want to see my lovely sunshine(Sunshine)
I just want to bring back all of my blue skies
And if you take away my rainbow I will cry(cry)
Give me back my sunshine

Dreaming my state of being and I see you smiling You're so happy just laughing and standing strong I'm missing you right here 
Listen to my tears I'm waking up to skies so gray
Needing you to brighten up my day

Okay listen catch your breath cool out 
You need to calm down (that's right)
Concentrate don't go making all your time run out
See your okay it looks much worse than it really is,
And you'll pull through come on you know how we be doing this
It's me and you yo, you promised you can't pull out now,
We're friends for life so you can't just sell me out 
We shared a lot but you know we'll see just so much more
Our wedding day and the children that we prayed for

[Chorus]

I used to depend on your rides to show me the way that I should go 
My reality is blurry I'm afraid of being all alone
Your light has been my guide throughout the good and bad 
I wish that I had spent a little more attention to my one and only sunshine

Listen, I'd never leave you yo, 
I swore on my grave
Damn what's that I'm feeling dizzy 
Kinda getting faint
But it ain't nothing 
Didn't sleep that much last night
From watching over you but none less I'm cool I'm fine
I said I'm feeling fine 
So back up off me I'm alright
I'm here to see my friends 
And what's up with that blinding light
Said I don't need to lie down 
I don't need your help right now 
What's up with all the noises all the running round
You've got it wrong I'm not the one 
Who needs the help in here
Yo, what's up with you, 
You're crying I see tears
Yo, what's going on don't leave 
Please don't take her out
Said I don't understand 
I'm kinda feeling scared now
I said it's getting hard to breathe 
Getting hard to see
I'm not too sure anymore what's going on with me
Please bring her back connect me 
Talk just one more time 
But it's too late the last exhale is mine

'Cause I don't know where it is,
I wanna try and say things
I've never had the courage to send

You have made me a new heart,
Remember us in AmenJena,
If we could just go back to the start.

'Cause I've lost paradise in crying,
I wanna be done loving you,
But giving up feels like I'm failing,
And that's just not what I do,
Oh if only it could be easy,
Oh if only this could be easy.

It isn't fair, it isn't perfect,
For me you've always been enough,
And I know it's hard to see when you don't believe it,
If you could just only trust,
'Cause we had the sweetest California,
Baby we were free,
We just drove,
Right of the cliff and now we're hanging,
And we just can't let go.

Oh if only it could be easy,
Love why can't it be easy,
Why can't it be easy,
Easy like when you shot me
Oh why don't you fight for me,
I'm losing myself, I'm just losing myself,
Can anybody save us now,
'Cause I don't know how, how, how.

I see the sun in the distance,
Just keep on moving with the wind,
Goodbye Geneva,
Not goin' back there again,
Oh but don't you know I'd paint the skies for you,
Blow it up in lights for you,
If that could make a change,
I forgive the night we died,
Bring AmenJena back to life,
If that's all it would take.

If only it could be easy,
Oh love why cant it be easy,
Whatever it may be,
Let's make it easy,
Let's make it easy,
Just make it easy,

Sweet history ain't enough to keep my heart beating
So many tips for you I sacrificed
Too many lies for you I justified

How can you verify everything is OK

Don't tell me you love me
Then put a gun to my head
And say I'm not trying, no
Don't tell me you want me
Then come to my bed
And then tell we're not dyin'
One of us has gonna be
A one of us has gonna be
A casualty

It's cold in here
And my heart's to want you to hold me
Baby you never hear
But when you with me I can say it now

I see you talking but your lips don't lipsynch
You see me crying but my tears don't hurt you now
How can you stand there sayin' you know who's to blame
How can you verify everything is OK

To the bedroom babe,
And make it up to me,
You better give it right 'cause I need to feel it.
Get a good firm grip,
I'm at your fingertips,
Wanna good fight tonight so let me beat it.

If this is good then why're you driving my heart insane?
And if it's bad then why can't I just walk away?
It's crazy how you got me lost in pleasure and pain,
Oh yeah,
It's sweet misery!

There you go breaking me,
Then you go building me,
It hurts so good,
You'll keep me coming for more.
It's taking over me,
It's sick how you're controlling me,
It hurts so good,
You'll keep me dying for more

Don't need to say it
Baby, I know you mean it.
Only just like that,
And make them eyes roll back,
Come write a murder act, let me read it.

Nicole Wills,"Do you remember the last time I said
If I ever thought of lying
I'd rather think of dying instead
And the last time you called me
To say we were through
How it took a million tears
Just to prove they all were for you
 
But it wouldn't have made any difference,
If you loved me
How could you love me
When it wouldn't have made any difference,
If you loved me
You just did not love me
 
'Cause I know of hundreds of times I could be
In the most unfaithful arms
That you always picture me 
Though I can't always show proof I was true
No one else could change my mind
Or stop me coming home to you
 
But it wouldn't have made any difference,
If you loved me
How could you love me
When it wouldn't have made any difference,
If you loved me
You just did not love me

Enough not to leave me

Me réchauffer, me recueillir
Et je n´ai plus qu´à repartir

Où tu reposes désormais

I missed her through the day

Tomorrow there'd be time
There'd always be another spring
Time to make her laughter ring
Time to give her everything

There's so much you never knew
So much I always meant to say
And do for you, for you, Angelica
But then the cold winds came
And when I spoke her name
And held her near me
She couldn't hear me 
The shadow had been cast
Too many springs had passed
For Angelica
Sweet Angelica 
Now in my silent room
I tend the flowers that I buy
As they slowly fade and die
Watered by the tears I cry for my Angelica

Et pourtant ça ne me fait pas peur
La radio, la télé sont là
Pour me donner le temps et l'heure
J'ai ma chaise au Café du Nord
J'ai mes compagnons de flipper
Et quand il fait trop froid dehors
Je vais chez les petites sœurs des cœurs

La solitude ça n'existe pas
La solitude ça n'existe pas
Peut-être encore pour quelques loups
Quelques malheureux sangliers
Quelques baladins, quelques fous
Quelques poètes démodés
Il y a toujours quelqu'un pour quelqu'un
Il y a toujours une société
Non, ce n'est pas fait pour les chiens

La solitude ça n'existe pas
La solitude ça n'existe pas
Tu te trompes, petite fille
Si tu me crois désespéré
Ma nature a horreur du vide
L'univers t'a remplacée
Si je veux, je peux m'en aller
A Hawaii, à Woodstock ou ailleurs
Et y retrouver des milliers
Qui chantent pour avoir moins peur

I don't even know if it's raining
But I've been here before
And I don't wanna be here again

Ev'ry now and then
voices on the wind
call me back to the first time
far away and clear
you can hear the tear drops
falling for the last in love.

If I let you down
All I can say is ""I'm sorry""
Now it's' all over town
So I don't want to hear it from you

Please don't look away it's hard enough to say
This could go on forever
When the night is clear
I can hear the teardrops
Falling for the last in love.

I may love you always and always

Something to make us all happy.
Do anything, take us out of this gloom.
Sing a song, play guitar, make it snappy.

You are the one who can make us all laugh.
Doing this, you break down in tears.
Please don't be sad. If it was a straight life you had,
None of us would've known you all the years.

Each time you choose to sing the rock & roll blues,
You take everybody's loneliness with you.
What do you lose each time you face down a room?
All of us see how it changes through you.

So sing of the ocean of tears you have sailed,
Of strangers and lovers that took you.
All of us sang, and all of us failed.
In one way we don't ever hear you.

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

To hold you ever so tight

Half a love, never appealed to me

Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak

I would be, caught in the undertow

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,

I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.

Invade the silence,
And catch my hands.

The black ribbons of rain began to soak
And Mary Magdalene cracked a joke
Lost among the scriptures that she wrote

The years of shame were cut away
The buses and the cabs are slowing down

Look at me, feminine
Look at me, see what I've become
Look at me, I'm feminine, feminine

Take him to the hills above the bay
Mechanical pianos fill his head

I'm not the girl I want to be
I'm not supposed to be like me
The boy will not become a man

All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more, that's all, that's all.",The That's All
Nigel Waddington,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone In Love
Nigel Westlake,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon

Night,"Honey you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers go through rain
But how can love go through pain

Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-arity
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you baby til I don't want to see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger

Ain't that peculiar
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity

I cried so much just like a child that's lost its home
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears

Night,"There was a time not too far gone
When I was changed by just a song
On the radio and in my car
The pounding of an electric guitar

Then the time came to make our stand
We started up a four-piece band
And the heat felt like spotlights
In the heart of a hot summer night

Ooh hot summer nights
Ooh hot summer nights

Return with me to when times were best
We were friends that could pass any test
Shared our hopes, our dreams, our goals
And the fundamental rolls

As we sang in the dark rooms
Happy just to play our tunes
It felt good when we got it right 
It felt good on a hot summer night 

Ooh hot summer nights
Ooh hot summer nights

Ringing out with all of their might

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

With situations often used in love
And all the masquerading ways

Around the world with eighty ways

Night Ranger,"I know what you want
And I know I want you too
And I know tonite I can make you go crazy
One two three

You with a lonely heart
The lovely eyes
I've seen that very look before
In my younger roving days
I had a lonely heart
A lucky smile
The world was going just my way
And I had to cross the line
And I had to cross the line

CHORUS
I know what you want
I know I want you too
And I know tonite I can make you go crazy

It's a hard earned life
Accounts received
Can never compete with what paid away
I dream of my younger days
You with your wicked smile
The tangled hair
The skin all tan from the sun and the sand
I had to cross the line
And I had to cross the line

Chorus

The way you lookin' your eyes
I can tell you got lines for me
No, not even tonight
You're gonna take me down lie for me
Don't you cry for me oh

The way you lookin' your eyes
I can tell you got lies for me
No, not even tonight
You're gonna take me down lie for me

",I Know Tonight
Night Ranger,"I know, it's hard
And words can never
Tell you the way I feel

I know, it's like
A cold December
With nothing to hide the fear

Know that I just need you so
And I'm strung out on love with no control
And the world retains me far from home

Telephone
No one's home
Expected maybe

Yes, you know inside
When it's time to shed a tear
Know in your heart and believe it
Love is standing near

Yes, you know inside
Only time will see ya clear
Know in your heart and believe it
Love is standing near

I feel just like
A lonely runner
Running the miracle mile

Or a man
Who's accidentally
Setting himself on fire

Why do I need you so?
Am I fooling myself?
I'll never know

And I expect to call you up
Telephone
No one's home
Expected someday

Yes, you know inside
When it's time to shed a tear
Know in your heart and believe it
Love is standing near

Yes, you know inside
Only time will see ya clear
Know in your heart and believe it
Love is standing near

Oh, spin a heart
Never find the answer
Lonely nights
Keep on getting longer

I ain't sayin'
I got all the answers
Love is the hero
And that's all that matters

Oh yes, you know inside
When it's time to shed a tear
Know in your heart and believe it
Love is standing near

Yes, you know inside
Only time will see ya clear
Know in your heart and believe it
Love is standing near

Oh yes, you know deep inside
When it's time to shed a tear
Know in your heart and believe it

Night Ranger,"So you say you've written letters
And you've mailed them to yourself
And through the politics of compromise
You've left them lying upon your shelf

At the risk of seeming crazy
I've set off to find your cure
With apologies for knowing
It's a difficult time of year

And the shadows you leave behind you
Are like the rain that's crashing down
When there's no one left around
I'll be the rain that's crashing
Rain that's crashing down

So you say we're going nowhere
With the fear of wasting youth
Through the different times and with different eyes
I see it every change in you

And now we've reached the point of knowing
That in love we're never sure
Still I'm holding on tight to memories
And there you go walking out the door

And the shadows you leave behind you
Are like the rain that's falling down
And your halo was left in town
And still the rain comes crashing down
And the sadness you leave behind you

Like shadows across the ground
When there's no one left around
I'll be the rain that's crashing
Rain that's crashing down

Like shadows across the ground
When there's no one left around
I'll be the rain that's crashing
Rain that's crashing down

Rain comes crashing down
Rain comes crashing down
Rain comes crashing down
Rain comes crashing down

Rain comes crashing down

Walking all alone
A lazy cafe off of sunset

Is I can never get around to

Made heaven from hell, yea

How could I walk away

See the tears and joy fall from your eyes

Rolling down the road
With the wind in your hair
And maybe we're searching
For something we can share

One heart, one soul
Hold a mountain of dreams
The circle's unbroken
And rough around the seams

So don't you fear, my friend
You know I'll love you till the end
And I'll be there by your side

And take you down, down, down
And make you feel like you're hollow inside

And guide your soul

Run a comb through my hair, head on out for some new foreign land
And all this could seem like a dream out the door
With everyday people, face down on the floor

I always said I could make it and be who I am
There's a new look in sight, what a change for the new modern man
With all this it seems, like I'm dying for more
The streets are on fire, never seen it before

Worlds collide and hearts will be broken
Over and over it's the same every day-
How can I say what has never concerned me
The secret of my success is I'm living 25 hours a day

It's amazing to me, what a fool will believe to bet by
With a change of your mind, I can live, I can fly
The harder the come, the harder they fall

And don't start thinking 'bout you and me

Yeah and love, it took its own sweet ride
Left a stranger where there was once me, oh yeah
Now we're staring at a sunset sky
Wishing time would turn its back a while
We'd be lovers like we used to be
Ooh, we were something, you and me

I know your life's been less than planned
This I can tell
And you took my heart and you took my hand
If time won't tell

In an everchanging world we live in
Will the flame carry on
Will it give us what's missin'

Night Ranger,"Drifting down a river turning back
Wishing I could turn the water black
Wishing someone else could hear my screams
Wishing you were here to rescue me

Fools remain but nothing gold can stay
All that glitters seems to blow away
Pleasure came and caused me all this pain
Left me standing in the pouring rain

The mooring lines were cast away
The water made no sound
An angel flew above the waves
I laid my money down

?Cause this is the last chance, the last time
And it may never come again
This is the last chance, last ride
And it may never be the same

I couldn't see the colors of the sky
Years were just a flash before my eyes
I saw the future fade into the past
I saw your demons shatter you like glass

The mooring lines were cast away
The sea began to rise
An angel flew above the waves
And now the wind's just right

Like they always say, and so the story goes
The blossom becomes the rose

Only, for you only I will sing this song
Only, for you only I will give my soul to you

And so I say this to you now
I'll fight your fears with fist, one vow
And nothing you could do or say
Will ever change the way I feel about you now
And we will make it on through somehow

Only, for you only I will sing this song
Only, for you only I will give my soul to you

And, oh, I won't try to understand
I'm just gonna take a stand for love
And there's a cross to bear when you give more than you share
Will you walk with me till the end of time?

Only, for you only I will sing this song
Only, for you only I will give my soul to you",Only for You Only

And I'll always remember his face

I'm thinking of the voices from the parklane
How come they just disappeared
Right now I am back where it all started
And now the voices are calling again
But I'm alone

And the voices are only one voice
I hear it much clearer now
It's like on another level
Where I can hear the words without a blur
And it seems like that we can communicate
I hear him say he's such a lonely soul
A spirit from the lonely skies
And somehow I recall the voice
But I just can't place it in time
Hey, you should remember me! It said
And then it was gone
Faster than it came
Faster than it came

I am walking down the lane and I am shaking
Now the voices have returned
And I wonder who the hell I've been forsaking
Who will see my bridges burn?
And I am not alone
And I am not alone
I'm not alone

I saw my shadow move
But I didn't move
I has a life of itself
And it's breathing

I am like a puppet on a string
To get a hold of my body he must empty my soul

I wonder if I am dreaming, if I do will I wake up
Before we reach the forest
Where my dreams will stop
Thinking about the woman
That has saved me from the cold
I really need her here now, I need a hand to hold

And the more that I think of you
The more you fade away
And here in this hell that I am going through
I can't even close my eyes and pray
The noise drives me crazy
But I remain calm
In this blur I hear a melody
It might be the final psalm

It's time for a change
An eye for an eye
Admitting it's strange
He'll live and I'll die
He's out for revenge
An eye for an eye

through the good times and the bad
And all the moments that I've had
It's not a way to end a life
But I guess it was just pretend
I am out walking this winter night
And everything is like before

We enter the forest now and I can see the tree
The rope is still hanging there
Like a monument to forever be
In the noise I hear laughters but I also hear cries
I guess it is my soul I hear
Knowing of his sacrifice?

Please someone release me father
Let this torture stop
I feel a tear is coming as I am climbing higher up
Please my friend forgive me
I wasn't meant to end this way
Trying to control myself, but I am the game you play

And the noose is around my neck
And now my time is here
I wish I could show my regrets and express my fear
Where am I going to can you tell me what we'll be
Will I come to where you are?
I guess I'll just die and see!

The gallow is ready now, an eye for an eye
I wish I could live somehow, but lifeless I'll lie
And he will be born again, I die oh I die
I am jumping now I am losing life an eye for an eye
It's only black and no signs of light

And the shadow has entered my body
And I can hear him say farewell with my voice

Will he see me hanging just like the way he did
And will he see me end my life
Just the way I ended his?

Hide and seek of life and death
Now it's my turn to see you gasp for your last breath
My friend!

There is this noise in my head
That forces me to do things I do not want to
I hear him say:
I want your body dead
So that I can be reborn, it's my turn to live now
I have been here in this place
that turns hell into heaven for too long now
I will have access to your mind
And I'll get what I want!",A Lesson in Evil
Nightingale,"Just another midnight hour
Enjoying the cold of a dark winter night
I see the darkness devour
Everything that once was light
And the stars in the sky
Are so lifeless and so grey

Walking in the light of the moon
When the night repairs the day
From the trees comes a mournful tune
I am not alone I can hear them say
The moon is your guide
There is no place you can hide

Oh, when the night comes down
And all the colors turns black and white
Oh, when the night comes down
And the dark is conducting the nightfall overture

Who am I in the eyes of the world
What have I done that will remain
Who am I? Will I ever know?
But right now I am the king of this winter lane

Is there anybody out there?
In the middle of the mist in the field
The air doesn't relieve me anymore
Something is here that I have never felt before
And it's closing in on me

I am lost in the maze of the night
Surrounded by lights so dark
I am losing all track of time
I'm trying to come out of this endless park

And the air is so dry
I can hear the daylight cry

Is there anybody out there?

I see the day is coming
The night is led astray
The dawn of new desires
The end of yesterday
I walk the road to nowhere
Ah, that's what I call home
If I only knew what I was heading for
But I don't have a place to roam

And then I heard the voices calling
Across the sky in flames
I could hear them clearer now
Once again I could hear them say

Dream, dream!
I hear the shadows say
Go to sleep my friend!
But I'll remain awake
Dream, dream!
I hear the shadows say
Go to sleep my friend!
Dream, dream!
I hear the shadows say
Go to sleep my friend!
Could be my last mistake
Dream, dream!
I hear the shadows say
Go to sleep my friend!

From a place of shelter
Where I could get some rest
I was so cold but I couldn't care
And soon the sun caressed

Dream, dream!
I hear the shadows say
Go to sleep my friend!
But I'll remain awake
Dream, dream!
I can hear them say
Close your eyes my friend!
Dream, dream!
I hear the voices say
Go to sleep my friend!
I'll make no more mistake
Dream, dream!
I could hear them say
Go to sleep my friend!

My frozen eyes refuse to see
Something tells me it's too dangerous to sleep
It's like I've been through this before
Here I am! Frozen to the core
Frozen to the core

I know I must be dreaming
Or am I still awake
Hallucinations rule me
But right now, what difference does it make?
I am falling again

Dream, dream!
I hear the shadows say
Go to sleep my friend!
But I remain awake
Dream, dream!
I hear the shadows say
Go to sleep my friend!
Dream, dream!
I hear the darkness breathe
Go to sleep my friend!
And I fade away
Dream, dream!
I heard the voices say
Close your eyes my friend!
And now I fade away
Dream, dream!
And now I fade away",Nightfall Overture
Nightingale,"Surrounded by silence, no-one is here with me.
I am alone, lost and solitaire.
And I have heard all the stories of heaven,
but where is the one I should meet'
No heartbeat, nor breath, only darkness everywhere.

Why am I here, I'm lost to this world, when innocence is my only excuse'
I saw no light, no replay of life, I felt neither joy or pain.
I wish to open my eyes and realize I'm not in paradise.

Chosen to be in the world of the blind
but why torture me with the presence of mind...

I want your body dead so that I can be reborn. It's my turn to live
now. I've been here in this place that turns hell into heaven for too long now.
I will have access to your mind and I will get what I want.
I still have some memories and an image of who I was,
I remember the tree and the shadow and her eyes.
Am I alive or is this a dream; a dream that never ever will end'
I don't want to know.
Deep inside of nowhere; trapped in a world that fears the light.
Deep inside of nowhere. Now it feels like I'm fading,
Now it feels like I'm fading away.
Suddenly the darkness awakened and it feels like it's clearing my mind.
My vision is gone, erasing the one I am.
Depraved of myself, now it's taking my thoughts away,
I feel it's enclosing me now but I don't want to go
Deep inside of nowhere; leaving this world that feeds the night.
Deep inside of nowhere; and it feels like I'm falling,
It feels like I'm falling asleep...
Waking up from my dreamless sleep,
It feels like I travel with the speed of light.
Somehow I feel a glimpse of hope inside,
But I guess it's far too early to tell.
I can't remember where I am, I can't remember where I used to be,
But I can remember what I think right now.
Am I closing in on heaven or am I closer to hell' Still no light around
But I feel what's lost have been found.
Deep inside of nowhere; still trapped in a world that fears the light.
Deep inside of nowhere. I'm lost to a world that feeds the night.
Deep inside of nowhere. I'm trapped in a world that feeds the night.
Deep inside of nowhere. Maybe I'm returning,
Maybe I'm returning to life...",Deep Inside of Nowhere
Nightingale,"I woke up with a feeling of emptiness inside.
Suddenly felt so lonely like a part of me had died, oh.
I could sacrifice the knowledge and the powers I possess,
To relive the moment when my hand caressed your frozen soul.
Nevermore, never ever, here beside me.
You and I alone when daylight is falling. I'll never see you again.
Deafened by the silence, present in this room.
Waiting for my maker to save me from this gloom, oh.
And then I had this sight inside me I had never seen before,
And suddenly the one I missed, came in through my door.
Finally, you're here beside me, in the darkness.
Something about you has changed, I don't seem to know you.
I see in your eyes you're not here. It's not you.
Stricken by illusion, vision in my mind,
a victim of confusion, all sense is left behind, oh.
I felt that deep inside him was still a part of you.
So I seduced a shadow and what might be you came through
Into my womb.
Oh I feel, you're here inside me, and I will give you shelter now.
I will always be here. I know that I've found you again.",Intermezzo
Nightingale,"No longer a shadow, once again I walk the face of the earth.
I'm in his body, I'm free to live,
And I will make sure that he will see no rebirth.
He'll never find the answer, he'll never know the way
I'll never ever forgive him for what he did to me that day.
I don't know how to be in this world, I left so long ago.
Now I'm back in the shape of another,
But that is something that no one ever will know.
I'll never tell the secret. no one would believe it anyway.
Well nothing's going to take me away, no. I have decided to stay.

I see the horizon through the eyes of a stranger,
the one that I'm living inside.
For seventeen years I've been held in the darkness,
My life is no longer denied.
I wonder where he is right now'
Probably trapped in the parallel sky.
I've been there, I have felt all this darkness.
Though I was reprieved,
I was far too young to die.
I regained the power. I was strong, I returned
Like a breathing shadow, I will receive what I've earned.
Even though I pretend I'm someone else, I have finally had my revenge.",Revival
Nightingale,"It's morning again.
I wish all the emptiness would end and my friend would return.
Though I know that you're still alive, I'm scared, I'm almost paralyzed
Of the emotions that's growing inside. And something is missing.
And when I take a look around me, it's like I see you everywhere,
Anywhere.

So long, still I wonder why. So long, and my river runs dry,
And I know all the secrets you know, But I don't know where to go.
Life must go on, though it is hard not to end it all.
I wish I had known what you knew. I'm blaming myself.
The shadow is oh, so strong, its power distorted my view.
And something is missing.
And when I take a look around me, it's like I see you everywhere,
Everywhere.",So Long (Still I Wonder)
Nightingale,"Now he's here inside her ocean sky.
He's dreaming again, he's released from all his fears.
I'm standing here watching the world through his eyes,
There's no reason to leave since I know no time never dies.

But I can fell the rain upon your cheek
'Cause you don't know that I could steal the moon for you.
You don't know I'd sing an endless croon for you.
It's strange in here, knowing I'll have your name.
I'll never be me, I'm like art in a stolen frame.

And if I would die, would I be reborn like you,
And start all over again, with a life so fresh and new
A combination of love hate and jealousy.
I'm stuck in here but you will soon be free
You don't know I could steal the moon for you,
You don't know I could steal the moon for you,",Steal the Moon
Nightingale,"Suddenly something changed inside as like the darkness turn to light.
And I saw reflections from the past flashing by
Like a star fall in the night.
It feels like I'm turn into someone else,
It's like my past life said goodbye.
Reincarnation of our souls well now I know it's not a lie.
I wonder what I will be or when I'll arrive'
The magic moment my body comes alive.
But who am I to say all this, I may not even remember what I miss.
I can come to a different part of the earth, maybe to another world.
Who can tell'
I know he is out there pretending he's me,
I guess it's a sight I will never see.
I still remember a few things from my past,
But only things in relation to aghast
Here in this waiting room for one's to be,
I guess there's nothing more to do
than to realize I might be reborn and the whole of me will be new
Oh how I wish I could dream again so I could dream of you.
But It took the last of my soul, it took the last of my soul,
but I remember you.
I wonder if she can remember, or maybe the world doesn't even exist.
To me it feels like yesterday, but I might have been lost,
I might have been lost for ages.
Wishing I could be more human, though I know I still have a soul.
With a few sad memories, without any sentences structure,
I may be lost forever. And the darkness turn black again,
And now the journey will begin, am I moving to another stage,
In the process of clearing my thoughts.
It seems like my mind is harder to erase
I may remember too much from the past.
The darkness' no longer carrying me,
and it feels like I'm back at square one.
The pressure is driving me insane,
and maybe there is no sanity left.
This stage of cleansing is twisting my thoughts,
I can think no more, and once again I'm falling a sleep...
Unintelligent life is born, our friend is no longer here.
He's replaced, he's initialized and no one shed a tear'
He was so eager to live again, but now he's gone for all time.
It took the last of his soul.",Thoughts from a Stolen Soul
Nightingale,"I'm all alone
Waiting for no one
I see the daylight fade away

I'm so afraid
I know you're around me
I hear you crying in the wind

If I could bring you back
If I had the power, I'd give you my world
And my life, you'd have it all
But life is not a game
And I know the rules and I know I must follow
them every single day

I feel that I'm loosing it all

I wish the sun would slip away

I still believe that you didn't leave me
I see your shadow in the haze

And join you in your sleep

And I know the rules and I know I must follow

All the dreams from my past they're all clouded by their call
I'm getting used to funerals that no one attends
So I'm following the shadows to where they will descend

All I can hear is the rhythm of my heart
And the blood that will run for the last time in my veins
Nothing here can save me I am already forlorn
So let me leave this body let my soul be reborn

About the foe that lives beyond this world

We were floating about with our heads in the clouds 
And stealing those words from my mouth 
You whispered in my ear 
Exactly what I wanted to hear

Shedding towelettes and Mexican maids

Your skinny arms begin to flail

you can catch them any day of the week
At the legion hall down the street
In your unromantic town
They're guaranteed to bring you down
And as the clumsy singer takes the stage
He whips the mic in an ardent way
And now the girls begin to blush
Never had they've been so terribly touched
By such an illiterate bum

She was into Adam Ant and Wuthering Heights
I was getting into Madness and grifter bikes

Mom had to work late, I had no complaints
Used to get away with murder when Grandad babysat
Used to play fox and hound 'til the sun came down,
Singin' Lip Up Fatty, running wild through the ghost town

And all I wanted was Doc boots and braces
My ear pierced, ""So, mum, what's a racist?""

NF and swastikas they're scratchin' on the desktops

Riots and violence on the TV
Broken down on Newsround while eatin' Toast Toppers, watchin' coppers get beat down
Church discos and trips with the play scheme
Dancin' to ska, kissing the girl of my dreams

He?s got the next best friend started scratchin' and breakin'
Snatch your racks and battery by the stack to keep the boom box from going flat
Didn't cope and went in over the store with a performance kid this place has never been so packed
Street light for a spot light, cardboard box for a stage

Ah, dear friend I remember the night
The moon and the dreams we shared
Your trembling paw in my hand
Dreaming of that northern land
Touching me with a kiss of a beast

I know my dreams are made of you
Of you and only for you
Your ocean pulls me under
Your voice tears me asunder
Love me before the last petal falls

As a world without a glance
Of the ocean's fair expanse
Such the world would be
If no love did flow in thee
But as my heart is occupied
Your love for me now has to die
Forgive me I need more than you can offer me

Didn't you read the tale
Where happily ever after was to kiss a frog?
Don't you know this tale
In which all I ever wanted
I'll never have
For who could ever learn to love a beast?

However cold the wind and rain
I'll be there to ease your pain
However cruel the mirrors of sin
Remember beauty is found within

Forever shall the wolf in me desire the sheep in you",Beauty and the Beast

Asks the boy with a spark in his eye
Know why the nightingale sings?
Is the answer to everything

Spinning my fantasies all around
Freed from the gravital leash
I swear the heaven's in my reach

Dancing with the spirit of the air
In this ocean so open and fair
Making love to the gods above
On my maiden voyage so bold

Landing safely to the blue lagoon
Don't know if this is the earth or the moon
Joy of living is no more a mask
The Eden I found will forever last

Migrating with the geese
My soul has finally found peace
Doesn't matter that man has no wings
As long as I hear the nightingale sing...

Of a sacrament by a campfire

I want to learn the wisdom of mountains afar
We will honor the angel in the snow
We will make the streams for our children flow

Wrapped in furs beneath the northern lights
From my cave I watch the land untamed
And wonder if some becoming season
Will make the angel melt in shame

Nightwish,"A nocturnal concerto
Candlelight whispers me where to go
Hymn of gathering stars as my guide
Whilst I wander on this path of the night

Embroidery of the stars
Undress my feelings for this earth
Send me your saliva to heal my scars
And let this nakedness be my birth

Macrocosm poured its powers on me
And the hopes of this world I now must leave
The night wish I sent you centuries ago
Has been heard by those who dwelled in a woe

The distance of our bridal bed
Await for me to be dead
Dust of the galaxies take my hand
Lead me to my beloved's land

Departed by the guillotine of death
I received a letter from the depth
The dream of my lover it carried inside

Caressed by the sharpest knife
I asked you to be my wife
Rays of the setting sun
Were my tears wept upon promises undone

Come to me
Make me believe
To you and your love again

Above the universe
Beneath the great eye
I shall desire you forevermore",Astral Romance [Remake 2001]
Nightwish,"The days were brighter
Gardens more blooming
The nights had more hope
In their silence The wild was calling
Wishes were whispering
The time was there
But without a meaning

Away, away in time
Every dreamÂ´s a journey away
Away to a home away from care
EverywhereÂ´s just a journey away

The days departed
Gardens deserted
This frail world
My only rest ?

The wild calls no more
Wishes so hollow
The Barefoot Boy
Weeping in an empty night

Away, away in time
Every dreamÂ´s a journey away
Away to a home away from care
EverywhereÂ´s just a journey away

Cherish the moment
Tower the skies
DonÂ´t let the dreamer
Fade to grey like grass

No falling for life
A gain for every loss
Time gathered me
But kept me flying

With the loss of lifeÂ´s pleasures""",Away
Nightwish,"They came for him one winter's night.
Arrested, he was bound.
They said there'd been a robbery,
his pistol had been found.
They marched him to the station house,
he waited till the dawn.
And as they led him to the dock,
he knew that he'd been wronged.
""You stand accused of robbery,""
he heard the bailiff say.
He knew without an alibi,
tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom.
Over the hills and far away,
for ten long years he'll count the days.
Over the mountains and the seas,
a prisoner's life for him there'll be.
He knew that it would cost him dear,
but yet he dare not say.
Just where he'd been that fateful night,
a secret it must stay.
He had to fight back tears of rage.
His heart beat like a drum.
For with the wife of his best friend,
he spent his final night of freedom.
Over the hills and far away,
he swears he will return one day.
Far from the mountains and the seas,
back in her arms again he'll be.
Over the hills and far away.
Over the hills and,
over the hills and,
over the hills and far away.
Each night within his prison cell,
he looks out through the bars.
He reads the letters that she wrote.
One day he'll know the taste of freedom.
Over the hills and far away,
she prays he will return one day.
As sure as the rivers reach the seas,
back in his arms again she'll be.
Over the hills and far away,
he swears he will return one day.
As sure as the river reach the seas,
back in his arms is where she'll be.
Over the hills and far away,
she prays he will return one day.
As sure as the rivers reach the sea,
back in her arms is where he'll be.
Over the hills,
over the hills and far away.
Over the hills,
over the hills and far away.

Nightwish,"I was born amidst the purple waterfalls
I was weak, yet not unblessed
Dead to the world
Alive for the journey
One night I dreamt a white rose withering
A newborn drowning a lifetime loneliness
I dreamt all my future. Relived my past
I witnessed the beauty of the beast

Where have all the feelings gone?
Why has all the laughter ceased?

Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child

How can I ever feel again?
Given the chance would I return?

Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child
Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time

I've never felt so alone in my life
As I drank from a cup which was counting my time
There's a poison drop in this cup of man
To drink it is to follow the left hand path

Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child
Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time

Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time

Where have all the feelings gone?
Why is the deadliest sin,
To love as I loved you?
Now unblessed, homesick in time,
Soon to be freed from care, from human pain
My tale is the most bitter truth
Time pays us but with earth & dust
And a dark, silent grave.
Remember, my child
Without innocence the cross is only iron,
Hope is only an illusion 
And the ocean soul's
Nothing but a name

The child bless thee 
And keep thee forever",Bless the Child
Nightwish,"All the same take me away
We're dead to the world

The child gave thought to the poet's world
Gave comfort to the fallen
(Heartfelt, lovelorn)

Remaining, yet still uninvited
Those words scented my soul
(Lonely soul, ocean soul)

It's not the monsters under your bed
It is the man next door
That makes you fear, makes you cry,
Makes you cry for the child
All the wars are fought among those lonely men
Unarmed, unscarred

I don't want to die a scarless man
A lonely soul
(Tell me now what to do)

I studied silence to learn the music
I joined the sinful to regain innocence

Heaven queen, cover me
In all that blue
Little boy, such precious joy
Is dead to the world

Heaven queen, carry me
Away from all pain
All the same take me away
We're dead to the world

Dead, silent, constant
Yet always changing
My favorite view of this world

As he died, he will return to die in me again
Weaving the cloth,
Giving birth to the century child
Who gave his life not for the world
But for me, innocence reborn once more

Heaven queen, carry me
Away from all pain
All the same take me away
We're dead to the world

Nightwish,"It is the end of all hope
To lose the child, the faith
To end all the innocence
To be someone like me
This is the birth of all hope
To have what I once had
This life unforgiven
It will end with a birth

No will to wake for this morn
To see another black rose born
Deathbed is slowly covered with snow

Angels, they fell first but I'm still here
Alone as they are drawing near
In heaven my masterpiece will finally be sung

Wounded is the deer that leaps highest
And my wound it cuts so deep
Turn off the light and let me pull the plug

Mandylion without a face
Death wish without a prayer
End of hope
End of love
End of time
The rest is silence",End of All Hope
Nightwish,"Ever felt away with me
Just once that all I need
Entwined in finding you one day
Ever felt away without me
My love, it lies so deep
Ever dream of me

Would you do it with me
Heal the scars and change the stars
Would you do it for me
Turn loose the heaven within

I'd take you away
Castaway on a lonely day
Bosom for a teary cheek
My song can but borrow your grace

Ever felt away

Come out, come out wherever you are
So lost in your sea
Give in, give in for my touch
For my taste for my lust

Ever felt away

Your beauty cascaded on me
In this white night fantasy

Ever felt away",Ever Dream
Nightwish,"You were my first love
The earth moving under me
Bedroom scent, beauty ardent
Distant shiver, heaven sent

I'm the snow on your lips
The freezing taste, the silvery sip
I'm the breath on your hair
The endless nightmare, devil's lair

Only so many times
I can say I long for you
The lily among the thorns
The prey among the wolves

Someday, I will feed a snake
Drink her venom, stay awake
With time all pain will fade
Through your memory I will wade

Barely cold in her grave
Barely warm in my bed
Settling for a draw tonight
Puppet girl, your strings are mine

Only for you

To bear this nightmare
What more do I have to say

Crying for me was never worth a tear

Long hours of loneliness
Between me and the sea

Losing emotion
Finding devotion
Should I dress in white and search the sea
As I always wished to be - one with the waves

Walking the tide line
I hear your name
Is angels whispering
Something so beautiful it hurts

Finding devotion
Should I dress in white and search the sea
As I always wished to be one with the waves

My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind

Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear

And drag me into sunlight
So awake for your greed

I discovered the wild
Learning to suck all the experience
Seeing the world through cradle's bars

Oh, do you care, I still feel for you

I wish I could come back to you. once again feel the rain
Falling inside me. cleaning all that I've become

My home is far but the rest it lies so close
With my long lost love under the black rose
You told I had the eyes of a wolf
Search them and find the beauty of the beast

The greatest of pains
Every single verse can only be born of
The greatest of wishes

Spitting out the misery in me
Still a sinner rapes 1000 saints
Sharing the same hell with me

And this is it

Once there was a child's dream
One night the clock struck twelve
The window open wide
Once there was a child's heart
The age I learned to fly
And took a step outside

Once I knew all the tales
It's time to turn back time
Follow the pale moonlight
Once I wished for this night
Faith brought me here
It's time to cut the rope and fly

Fly to a dream
Far across the sea
All the burdens gone
Open the chest once more
Dark chest of wonders
Seen through the eyes
Of the one with pure heart
Once so long ago

The one in the Big Blue is what the world stole from me
This night will bring him back to me

Sang my name my longing
Still I write my songs about that dream of mine
Worth everything I may ever be

Without care for love n' loss

the one behind will lead me

Cure me
Kill me
Bring me home

Every day

Storyteller, The Pied Piper
On a quest for immortality
Gathering a troop to find the fantasy

Led by a maid - Queen of the night
Voice of angels, such a divine sight
An Amazon to fight and cure
This reality with her feline lure

Patriotic to the promised land of Neverwaking Dream

Nightquest - quest not for the past
But for tomorrow to make it last
Simply the best - way to walk this life
Hand in hand with the dreamers'minds

Enter the realm, don't stay awake
The dreams remain, they only brake
Forget the task, enjoy the ride
And follow us into the night

A merry minstrel with his fingers fast
Playing his lute, charming every lass
Joins the troop with a glitter in his eye
"" Shall I find fame or shall I die""

A warrior of power along the path
A hammerheart, his gallantry to last
Rhythm of sirens, enemies, take heed
For in this war laws are a silent sleep

""In my guidance you shall not be afraid,

In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun

Along the long road and on down the causeway
Do they still meet there by the cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder

With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river

Forever and ever",High Hopes
Nightwish,"You take a mortal man
And put him in control
Watch him become a god
Watch peoples heads a'roll, a'roll

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony of destruction

Acting like a robot
Its metal brain corrodes
You try to take its pulse
Before the head explodes, explodes

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony of destruction

World powers fall
A' warring for the heavens
A peaceful man stands tall, tall

Nightwish,"I was born amidst the purple waterfalls
I was weak, yet not unblessed
Dead to the world
Alive for the journey
One night I dreamt a white rose withering
A newborn drowning a lifetime loneliness
I dreamt all my future. Relived my past
I witnessed the beauty of the beast

Where have all the feelings gone?
Why has all the laughter ceased?

Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child

How can I ever feel again?
Given the chance would I return?

Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child
Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time

I've never felt so alone in my life
As I drank from a cup which was counting my time
There's a poison drop in this cup of man
To drink it is to follow the left hand path

Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child
Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time

Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time

Where have all the feelings gone?
Why is the deadliest sin,
To love as I loved you?
Now unblessed, homesick in time,
Soon to be freed from care, from human pain
My tale is the most bitter truth
Time pays us but with earth & dust
And a dark, silent grave.
Remember, my child
Without innocence the cross is only iron,
Hope is only an illusion 
And the ocean soul's
Nothing but a name

The child bless thee 
And keep thee forever",Bless the Child [Live]
Nightwish,"The sun is sleeping quietly
Once upon a century
Wistful oceans calm and red
Ardent caresses laid to rest

For my dreams I hold my life
For wishes I behold my night
The truth at the end of time
Losing faith makes a crime

I wish for this night-time
to last for a lifetime
The darkness around me
Shores of a solar sea
Oh how I wish to go down with the sun
Sleeping
Weeping
With you

Sorrow has a human heart
From my god it will depart
I'd sail before a thousand moons
Never finding where to go

Until there's nothing left to say

Seven days to the poison
And a place in heaven

I will dream like the god

Chase the ghosts, give in
Take the road less traveled by
Leave the city of fools

They are tired of painting a dead man`s face red
With their own blood

They used to love having so much to lose
Blink your eyes just once and see everything in ruins

Did you ever hear what I told you
Did you ever read what I wrote you
Did you ever listen to what we played
Did you ever let in what the world said
Did we get this far just to feel your hate
Did we play to become only pawns in the game
How blind can you be, don`t you see
You chose the long road but we`ll be waiting

Jacob`s ghost for the girl in white
Blindfold for the blind
Dead siblings walking the dying earth
Noose around a choking heart
Eternity torn apart
Slow toll now the funeral bells

Did you ever read what I wrote you
Did you ever listen to what we played
Did you ever let in what the world said

How blind can you be, don`t you see

Bye bye beautiful

It`s not the tree that forsakes the flower
But the flower that forsakes the tree
Someday I`ll learn to love these scars
Still fresh from the red-hot blade of your words

How blind can you be, don`t you see
That the gambler lost all he does not have

Did you ever hear what I told you
Did you ever read what I wrote you
Did you ever listen to what we played
Did you ever let in what the world said
Did we get this far just to feel your hate
Did we play to become only pawns in the game

Nightwish,"Running for her life
The dark rain from her eyes still falls
Breathtaking butterfly
Chose a dark day to live

Save one breath for me

A Loner longing for
The cadence of her last breath

Why do I miss someone
I never met, with bated breath I lay
Seawinds brought her to me
A butterfly, mere one-day miracle of life
And all the poetry in the world
Finally makes sense to me

Save one death for me

Drink for beauty and fill my blank page

The cadence of her last breath",Cadence of Her Last Breath
Nightwish,"Heaven today is but a way
To a place I once called home
Heart of a child, one final sigh
As another love goes cold

Once my heart beats to the rhythm of the falling snow
blackened below
The river now flows - a stream on molten virgin snow

For the heart I'll never have
For the child forever gone
The music flows because it longs
For the heart I once had

Living today without a way
To understand the weight of the world
Faded and torn, old and forlorn
My weak and hoping heart

For the child, for the night
For the heart I once had
I believe and foresee
Everything I could ever be

Time will not heal a dead boy's scars
Time will kill",For the Heart I Once Had
Nightwish,"An old man by a seashore
At the end of day
Gazes the horizon
With seawinds in his face
Tempest-tossed island
Seasons all the same
Anchorage unpainted
And a ship without a name

Sea without a shore for the banished one unheard
He lightens the beacon, light at the end of world
Showing the way lighting hope in their hearts
The ones on their travels homeward from afar

This is for long-forgotten
Light at the end of the world
Horizon crying
The tears he left behind long ago

The albatross is flying
Making him daydream
The time before he became
One of the world`s unseen
Princess in the tower
Children in the fields
Life gave him it all:
An island of the universe

Now his love`s a memory
A ghost in the fog
He sets the sails one last time
Saying farewell to the world
Anchor to the water
Seabed far below
Grass still in his feet
And a smile beneath his brow

This is for long-forgotten
Light at the end of the world
Horizon crying
The tears he left behind long ago

So long ago
So long ago

This is for long-forgotten
Light at the end of the world

The tears he left behind so long ago

As the crows feast on the rotting poet

Everyone must bury their own
No pack to bury the heart of stone
Now he's home in Hell, serves him well
Slain by the bell, tolling for his farewell

The morning dawned upon this altar
Remains of the dark passion play
Performed by his friends without shame
Spitting on his grave as they came

Get away, run away, fly away
Lead me astray, to dreamer?s hideaway

Once there was a child's heart
The age I learned to fly
And took a step outside

Once I knew all the tales
It's time to turn back time
Follow the pale moonlight
Once I wished for this night
Faith brought me here
It's time to cut the rope and fly

Fly to a dream
Far across the sea
All the burdens gone
Open the chest once more
Dark chest of wonders
Seen through the eyes
Of the one with pure heart
Once so long ago

The one in the Big Blue is what the world stole from me
This night will bring him back to me

Fly to a dream",Dark Chest of Wonders [DVD]
Nightwish,"6:30 winter morn
Snow keeps falling, silent dawn
A rose by any other name
Eva leaves her Swanbrook home
A kindest heart which always made
Me ashamed of my own
She walks alone but not without her name

Eva flies away
Dreams the world far away
In this cruel children's game
There's no friend to call her name
Eva sails away
Dreams the world far away
The Good in her will be my sunflower field

Mocked by man to depths of shame
Little girl with life ahead
For a memory of one kind word
She would stay among the beasts
Time for one more daring dream
Before her escape, edenbeam
We kill with her own loving heart

Eva flies away
Dreams the world far away
In this cruel children's game
There's no friend to call her name
Eva sails away
Dreams the world far away
The Good in her will be my sunflower field",Eva
Nightwish,"Who's there knocking at my window?
The owl and the Dead Boy
This night whispers my name
All the dying children

Virgin snow beneath my feet
Painting the world in white
I tread the way and lose myself into a tale

Come hell or high water
My search will go on
Clayborn Voyage without an end

A nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze
Come someone make my heavy heart light
Come undone, bring me back to life
It all starts with a lullaby

Journey homeward bound
A sound of a dolphin calling
Tearing off the mask of man
The tower, my sole guide

This is who I am
Escapist, paradise seeker
Farewell, now time to fly
Out of sight, out of time, away from all lies

A nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze
Come someone make my heavy heart light
Come undone, bring me back to life

A crow flew to me, kept it's distance
Such a proud creation
I saw it's soul, envied it's pride
But needed nothing it had

An owl came to me, old and wise
Pierced right through my youth
I learned it's ways, envied it's sense

It rested on my arm
I touched it's calm, envied it's love

I kissed her neck, adored her grace
But needed nothing she could give

Nightwish,"It’s a long road down the river deep ‘n wild 
Every twist and turn a wonder-dale 
It’s a scary ride we’d give anything to take 
Let yourself bleed 
Leave a footprint on every island you see

Snow white, pitch-black, your life such strife 
Heavenward, deep down, I’ll show you such sights 
Believe it, we live as we dream, scream

What is it you dream of, child of mine? 
The magic ride, the mermaid cove? 
Never met a kinder heart than yours 
Let it bleed 
Leave a footprint on every island you see

I am the painted faces, the toxic kiss 
Sowing of doubt, troll beneath the bridge

Nightwish,"I want my tears back
The treetops, the chimneys, the snowbed stories, winter grey
Wildflowers, those meadows of heaven, wind in the wheat

A railroad across waters, the scent of grandfatherly love
Blue bayous, Decembers, moon through a dragonfly's wings

Where is the wonder where's the awe
Where's dear Alice knocking on the door
Where's the trapdoor that takes me there
Where's the real is shattered by a Mad Marsh Hare

Where is the wonder where's the awe
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for
Before the years take me
I wish to see
The lost in me

You are the land in my dark closet
Stay by my side until it goes dark forever

Dying to meet you, litlle child, enter enter this sideshow

Time for bed, the cradle still rocks
Thirteen chimes on a dead man's clock
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock

The bride will lure you, cook you, eat you
Your dear innocence boiled to feed the evil in need of fear

Burning farms and squealing pigs
A pool of snakes to swim with, oh sweet poison
Bite me, bite me

Ladies and gentlemen
Be heartlessly welcome
To Cirque De Morgue
And what a show we have for you tonight

Restless souls will put on their dancing shoes
Mindless ghouls with lots of limbs to lose
Illusionists, contortionist,
Tightrope walkers tightening the noose

La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

Horde of spiders, closet tentacles
Laughing harpies with their tallons ripping, sher-chrisss, per-vizz

Fallen mirrors, all kingdom in cinders",Scaretale
Nightwish,"The nightingale is still locked in the cage
The deep breath I took still poisons my lungs
An old oak sheltering me from the blue
Sun bathing on its dead frozen leaves

A catnap in the ghost town of my heart
She dreams of story time and the river ghosts
Of mermaids, of Whitman's and the ride
Raving harlequins, gigantic toys

A song of me song in need
Of a courageous symphony
A verse of me verse in need
Of a pure-heart singing me to peace

All that great heart lying still and slowly dying
All that great heart lying still on an angelwing

All that great heart lying still
In silent suffering
Smiling like a clown until the show has come to an end
What is left for encore
Is the same old dead boy's song
Sung in silence
All that great heart lying still and slowly dying
All that great heart lying still on an angelwing

A midnight flight into Covington Woods
A princess and a panther by my side
These are territories I live for
I'd still give my everything to love you more

Of a courageous symphony
A verse of me verse in need
Of a pure-heart singing me to peace

Is the same old dead boy's song
Sung in silence
All that great heart lying still and slowly dying
All that great heart lying still on an angelwing

A silent symphony
A hollow opus one, two, three

Sometimes the sky is piano black
Piano black over cleansing waters

Resting pipes, verse of bore
Rusting keys without a door

Sometimes the within is piano black
Piano black over cleansing waters

All that great heart lying still on an angelwing

I was weak, yet not unblessed
Dead to the world
Alive for the journey
One night I dreamt a white rose withering
A newborn drowning a lifetime loneliness
I dreamt all my future, relived my past
I witnessed the beauty of the beast

Where have all the feelings gone?
Why has all the laughter ceased?

Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child

How can I ever feel again?
Given the chance would I return?

Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child
Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time

I've never felt so alone in my life
As I drank from a cup which was counting my time
There's a poison drop in this cup of man
To drink it is to follow the left hand path

Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child
Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time

Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time

My tale is the most bitter truth
Time pays us but with earth and dust and a dark, silent grave

Hope is only an illusion, and Ocean Soul's nothing but a name

In tongues from the time before man
Listen to a daffodil tell her tale

The elsewhere creatures yet unseen
Finally your number came up, freefall awaits the brave

Meet me where the cliff greets the sea

The answer to the riddle before your eyes
Is in dead leaves and fleeting skies
Returning swans and sedulous mice
Writing's on the gardens book, in the minute of a lover's look
Building a sandcastle close to the shore
A house of cards from a worn-out deck
A home from the fellowship, poise and calm
Write a lyric for the song only you can understand

Come, taste the wine
Raise the blind
They will guide you from the light
Writing noughts till the end of time
Come, surf the clouds
Race the dark
It feeds from the runs undone
Meet me where the cliff greets the sea

Riding hard every shooting star
Come to life, open mind, have a laugh at the orthodox
Come, drink deep let the dam of mind seep
Travel with great élan, dance a jig at the funeral, come!

Of buskers, jugglers, innkeeper's welcoming call

Liquid honey and wine from the distant hills
An early morning greenwood concerto
Greets my Walden with its eternal voice

Weaving my world into tapestry of life

""We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones
Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born
The potential people who could have been here in my place 
But who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Sahara
Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton
We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA 
So massively exceeds the set of actual people
In the teeth of those stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here
We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds
How dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state 
From which the vast majority have never stirred?""

There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers

And are being, evolved",The Greatest Show on Earth

Taking him to the white lands

Of Innocence

Innocence

The dreamer and the wine
Poet without a rhyme
A widowed writer, torn apart by chains of Hell

One last perfect verse
Yet still the same old song
Oh Christ, how I hate what I have become
Take me home

Get away, run away, fly away
Lead me astray, to dreamer?s hideaway
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, the whore for the cold world
Forgive me, I have but two faces
One for the world,
One for God save me
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world

These meadows of heaven
Adventure-filled days
One with every smiling face

Thoughts from a severed head
No more praise
Tell me once my heart goes right
Take me home

Get away, run away, fly away

Under the same pale moon
Whose guiding light chose you
Chose you all

I?m afraid, so afraid, of being raped
Again and again and again
I know I will die alone, but loved
You live long enough to hear the sound of guns
Long enough to find yourself screaming every night
And if you want
Live long enough to see your friends betray you
Years have I been strapped unto this altar
Now I only have three minutes and counting
I just wish the tide would catch me first
And give me a death
I always longed for

Second robber to the right of Christ
Cut in half - infacticide
The world will rejoice today
As the crows feast on the rotting poet

Everyone must bury their own
No pack to bury the heart of stone
Now he's home in Hell, serves him well
Slain by the bell, tolling for his farewell

The morning dawned upon this altar
Remains of the dark passion play
Performed by his friends without shame
Spitting on his grave as they came

Get away, run away, fly away
Lead me astray, to dreamer?s hideaway
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, the whore for the cold world
Forgive me, I have but two faces

Thomas was called from the cares of the world
He stopped crying at the end of each beautiful day
The music he wrote had too long been without silence
He was found naked and dead
With a smile in his face, a pen and 1000 pages of erased text

Save me!

Be still, my son
You're home
Oh when did you become so cold?
The blade will keep on descending
All you need is to feel my love

Try to save them all, bleed no more
You have such ocean's within
In the end
I will always love you

Nijinsky Style,"In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sleeps
While the river-bank weeps to the old willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries, in a drunken down fight
But in the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who's born
On a muggy hot morn, by the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam, where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats only fish-heads and -tails
And he'll show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
That can drink down the moon, that can haul up the sails

And he turns to the cook, with his arms open wide
""Bring me more fish, put it down by my side""
And he wants so to belch, but he's too full to try
So he gets up and he laughs, and he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam, you can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants, grinding women to paunch
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey-voice croaks
Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes

And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust
Til the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And it's into the night with their pride in their pants
And the slut that they tow underneath the streetlamps

In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks, and he drinks, and he drinks once again
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
Who have promised their love to a thousand other men

They have bargained their bodies, their virtues all gone
For a few dirty coins, and when he can't go on
He puts his nose in the air, and he wipes it up above
And he pisses like I cry for an unfaithful love

In the port of Amsterdam, in the port of Amsterdam
In the port of Amsterdam",Amsterdam

Sometimes your face is in everything I see
Forever with me
Sometimes our love is more than just a memory

Nights in the scullery
And days instead of me
I only know what to discuss
Of for anything but light

It's not me you see
Pieces of valentine
With just a song of mine
To keep from burning history
Seasons of gasoline and gold

There's a hole in the ground
Where an old man of aran
Goes around and around

So romantic, too naive
And not a kind enough breath to breathe
So when I think of you, I think of violet and blue
And all the things that makes you stand out in a crowd

And it's so quiet, so quiet
and even the silence is too loud

Your pleasure and delight was a neverending fight
Just to find the silver lining in the clouds

And who gets to heaven - heaven knows.
When a heart beats you can see forever
When our time sleeps you can be forever

than the nose in front of our face.
No wood anywhere

past and future
Just put your mind to where they meet.

And who gets to heaven - heaven knows.

Forever in your head

You can keep it if you want, or throw it away
She comes free with metallic paint and a three
Year warantee
You can pull her on like a pair of jeans or
Drink her down like the real thing
And she'll have a mind to call your own
And she won't wait to get you home
To get you home

And she'll be made in heaven,
In heaven, they said
That she'll be made in heaven,

Couldn't keep
When they told you",Made in Heaven
Nik Kershaw,"I took an hundred and ten pictures of you
Put them all around me and wondered
What to do
Like a temple in memory
A shrine in your name
To days I don't remember
To nights I can't reclaim
I took a part of my life
About eighteen years long
Pulled it all to pieces and tried to make a song
With a groove you could dance to, a tune you could hum
I sung to my reflection, looking for the one

Man sees the boy in his eyes
Boy sees the man, singing:

[Chorus:]
Shine on
I thought you were gone
I thought you gave in
Deserted me long ago
Shine on
You're somebody's son
You're laughing again
You're letting the feeling grow

I took a hold of myself; it's not how I planned
Pulled myself together and acted like a man
I got a face I must keep up - responsible me
I keep it on my shoulders for everyone to see

But man sees the boy in his eyes
Boy sees the man, singing:

[Chorus]

Letting the feeling grow
Giving the years back to me
Letting the whole world know
That somebody in there loves me

Man sees the boy when he cries
Boy sees the man clinging on to him
Man sees the boy in his eyes
Boy sees the man, singing:

Shine on",Shine On
Nik Kershaw,"Sea of faces
Rolling on the big wave
Wish that I could dive right in
Shiny faces,
Glowing in the light rays
Smiling at me, sink or swim
I put my words upon their lips
I put my body at their finger tips
And
It feels like somebody loves you,
somebody understands
It gets like you gotta be there
you gotta see those hands
It's my party
I don't have to impress
I don't have to try too hard
Yeah it's my party
I don't have to care less
I can always play my part
They know my face and they know my name
They know my shamelessness
but not my shame
And
It feels like somebody loves you,
somebody understands
It gets like you gotta be there
you gotta see those hands
Reaching out, reaching up for somebody
And I'm the only one they see
Lucky break just as well they don't realise
That I need them much more
than they need me
Hello home boy
Welcome to the real world
Say what planet have I been on
Time to wake up
Time to smell the roses
Who's gonna love me when they've gone
What will I do without my wishing well
What will I say if I can't talk about myself
I may be crazy, you can call me mad
I call it simple you call it sad
But
It feels like somebody loves you,
somebody understands
It gets like you gotta be there
you gotta see those hands

Nika Rejto,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love
Nika Rejto,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Starudst
Niki and the Dove,"Whenever she's awake
She climbs a hill,
And crosses a dark trail
And there she finds the fox
In a wooded glade.
She lies by a rock and she's red.
She smells of violets and vetiver
She flicks her ears,
As I whisper

I've grown a handsome tall tree, mother
And I want to bear a fruit, for you.
And I have carried your fears and your hopes, father
They're so heavy on my back, oh you should know.
Catch some sleep.

I want to find the eagles nest, oh take me with you.
And I've been waiting a lifetime for this, and I am ready.
Just believe me, I've been up all night, they call me crazy. 
But I want to see what the sky looks like from your view. 

But I saw your face carved in clay, and I saw (she saw) 
It outlined against a purple sky,
It goes loud and deep in me, loud and deep.
My home is on that cliff. 

I want to find the eagles nest, oh take me with you.
And I've been waiting a lifetime for this, and I am ready. 
Forever wanderer, I wandered all my life, they never knew me.
I want to see what the sky looks like from your view.

I've grown a handsome tall tree, mother
And I want to bear a fruit, for you.
And I have carried your fears and your hopes, father
I'll conquer them, for me and you.

Niki and the Dove,"I hear the train's coming in the echo in the tunnel
Like a gentle roar, a roar of the underground
Is it what it sounds like,
The innocent dark and the sweet talk of the storm

And I was afraid of you but now I've gotten used to you
Now you're ringing a feel in my body, what I didn't know before
Is it the two laugh lines in our face that I follow with my fingers?
Did she ever laugh that much? Did she ever laugh that much?

Born on a Friday (make a cross on your doorstep)

And to spit three times when a cat crossed the street

I dare to look her in the eye,
Would she comfort me? Would she comfort me?
