Barenaked Ladies,"Ever since we said our good-byes
The onion rings, the phone makes me cry
Something isn't right
Like the Deep Blue without the Great White

In the morning open your eyes
The waterfalls, the fire flies
You're an abacus
And my heart was counting on us

Your heart's got a heavy load
There's still a long way to go
Keep your eyes on the road

Crescent moon sings me to sleep
The birches bark, the willows weep
But I lie awake; I'm adrift without a snowflake

Your heart's got a heavy load
There's still a long way to go
Keep your eyes on the road",Adrift
Barenaked Ladies,"It was an upset
In two minutes flat
We're back on the freeway
Foot to the mat

I can't understand it
We had it down pat
It's very upsetting
Could we leave it at that

We all had positions
We each had a role
We'd overrehearsed it
We had full control

They can't teach you acting
It's there in your soul
It's the same with a bank job
And each thing we stole

So I don't need attitude
'Cause you knew just what to do
We all did our best now
We all need to rest now
Leave me alone
And wait by the phone

I was the driver
You ran the show
You had the last word
The go or no go

I knew every laneway
In Ontario
But it's not what you're sure of
It's what you don't know

It should have been filled with
The usual ones
Throwing their cash in
To mutual funds

We all had our ski masks
And sawed off shotguns
But how do you plan for
A bank full of nuns

But I guess we panicked
We all have taboos
And they were like zebras
They had us confused

We should be in condos
With oceanfront views
Instead we're most wanted
On the 6 o'clock news

So, I don't need attitude
'Cause you knew just what to do
We all did our best now
We all need to rest now
Leave me alone
And wait by the phone

Inside the police car
You tried to explain
Your crisis of conscience
The voice in your brain

And now that the whole thing
Has gone down the drain
I think we all know who
Should shoulder the blame

'Cause you made a choice there
Almost sublime
I'm all for compassion
Just not on my dime

You look like an amateur
And that's the real crime
So I'll take a walk now
And you do the time

And I don't need attitude
'Cause you knew just what to do
We all did our best now
We all need to rest now
Leave me alone
There's no need to phone

We all did our best now
We all need to rest now
Leave me alone
We all did our best now
We all need to rest now
Leave me alone",Bank Job
Barenaked Ladies,"I'm a kid in a candy store
I'm a bull in a china shop
I'm a tired old metaphor
For everything you can't afford
And everything you can't afford to be

I'm a public embarrassment
I'm a bottle of diet poison
I'm a walking advertisement
For everything I never meant
And everything I never meant to be

I can't hear a thing
'Cause I've stopped listening

I'm the reason I don't go out
I'm afraid I might tell me something
I'm the shadow of every doubt
I'm the product the song's about
And I'm the product the song's about to be

I can't hear a thing
'Cause I've stopped listening
I can't hear a thing
'Cause I've stopped listening

Every morning
Since I was born
It's been hard to look in the mirror
And see my face for the horns

All the fun that the law allows
All the fun but with half the meaning
Come on over, I'll show you how
If you lived here, you'd be home by now
If you still lived here, you'd be home now with me

I can't hear a thing
'Cause I've stopped listening
I can?t hear a thing
'Cause I've stopped listening",Bull in a China Shop
Barenaked Ladies,"What's a boy to do?
When you tell your tale
And it never fails
I just end up feeling bad for you

With your hang-dog eyes
You can bring me down
Now I'm wrapped around your whole hand
Stop looking so surprised

You make it easy (Easy)
Make it easy (Easy)

I've been burned before
You're not fooling me
There's no mystery
You've forgotten what you're hiding for

Call it self defense
You can obfuscate
And manipulate
But it's only at your own expense

You make it easy (Easy)
Make it easy (Easy)
Make it easy (Easy)
Make it easy (Easy)

Easy to be with you
Easy to obey
Easy to forgive you at the end of the day
Easy now to judge you
Easy to betray
Easy to adore you though you want to run away

It's easy

Look what you have done
I can do the same
Two can play this game
You'll no longer be the only one

You make it easy (Easy)
Make it easy (Easy)
Make it easy (Easy)
Easy (Easy)",Easy
Barenaked Ladies,"On the path of life, I wish you well
With urgent chariots, we will meet again in Hell
Kept my head down and moved
'Til every friend I'd known was gone

Then one day, I was not alone
Everything had changed
Everything was strange
Everything had changed
Everything was strange

When in rags and when in wealth
A solemn promise never to give too much of myself
Despite the hopeful words I've said
I've lived my life inside my head

Then one day, I was not alone
Everything had changed
Everything was strange
Everything had changed
Everything was strange

I hold my breath and count to ten
I hate it now, hated it then
Seen it all before
A failure and a bore
That's what friends are for

So it seems I must have won
As I survey the ashes of the damage that I've done
Everyone I've ever known
Is just as closed off and alone

Then one day, I was not alone
Everything had changed
Everything was strange
Everything had changed
Every thing",Everything Had Changed
Barenaked Ladies,"Side of the road I stopped and
Picked up the pieces of your car
You were just standing, speechless
Knowing you'd never travel far
That's what you do when someone's given up on you
That's when I knew I was giving up
And giving in
That's when I knew where I was
That's when I knew I was home

Stuck in the middle of the road
For better or worse we compromise
You may have won my hand, dear
But it was the consolation prize
That's when I knew that I was running out on you
That's what you do when time is running out
Running down
That's when I knew where I was
That's when I knew that I was home

Where does the heart reside
If not where I lay my head?
I could run but I'm petrified
And choose this instead
Again
And again

End of the road I'm running
And look back to survey where I'd been
Someday I'll write and ask you
If you could imagine what I'd seen
How could you think that I could turn my back on you?
How did you think this would be turning out?
And turning around
What could I do but call you?
What could I do but call this home?
That's when I knew where I was
That's when I knew that I was home",Home
Barenaked Ladies,"It was often talked about; it was often raised
But nothing was ever done about it
To hear the way they talked about it, no one could be saved
But nothing was ever done about it

Shall I take back everything I've ever said
And live my whole life in silence instead?

It was oversimplified; it was under-thought
And nothing was ever done to stop it
Everything was fortified by all the lies we bought
And nothing was ever done to stop it

Shall I take back everything I've ever said
(Shall I take back all my attacks? All of my accusations?)
And live my whole life in silence instead?
(All my mistrust - we never discussed anyone's reservations)

There was a time when a crime was a crime
But now I think I'm losing my mind
Or taking it all too hard
Taking it all too hard
Taking it all too hard

Shall I take back everything I've ever said
(Shall I take back all my attacks? All of my accusations?)
And live my whole life in silence instead?
(All my mistrust - we never discussed anyone's reservations)
Keep to myself

Maybe you're right

Barenaked Ladies,"I left you in the rain
Peterborough and the Kawarthas
Your reflection in the pane
Peterborough and the Kawarthas

Apples, pears, prunes, and plums
His favorite food, I told his mum
Wait for him at the end of the slide
When he climbs the stairs, stay by his side

I heard you got some rain
Peterborough and the Kawarthas
Looks like we're in for the same
Peterborough and the Kawarthas

Barenaked Ladies,"It couldn't happen to a better man
It wouldn't happen with a better plan
While we were napping someone else began
To rule the world with love

It didn't happen to us overnight
Just 'cause it happened doesn't mean it's right
To our embarrassment we lost the fight
To rule the world with love

Hearts are won, empires fall
In love with love
Love will conquer all for one
One for all is fair in love and war

It couldn't happen to a nicer guy
You shouldn't ever have to question why
Just with the power of suggestion I
Could rule the world with love

I need to love you with an iron fist
I need to love you with a secret list
I need to love you til you don't exist
And rule the world with love

Love
Love
Love as defined by whom?

Hearts are won, empires fall
In love with love
Love will conquer all for one
One for all is fair in love and war
Love and war are one

How could it happen when we couldn't lose?
And now we're slapping makeup on the bruise
Though it was handed to us we refused
To rule the world with love

Barenaked Ladies,"The moon is full
But there is an incompleteness
The days are beautiful
But I feel a bitter sweetness
If I had a wish, or even a choice, I'd wake up to the sound of your voice

Oh, how I miss waking up to the sound of your voice

I let you down
And fell right off your good list
I hope each day you'll find peace
And forgiveness
The alarm clock rings
What a lonely noise
And I long for the sound of your voice

Oh, how I miss waking up to the sound of your voice

Take it from me: there's not much to see
In this void

The saying goes
There will be other dances
This little song is about
Second chances
Just say the word
And I will rejoice
And wake up to the sound of your voice

Oh, how I miss waking up
To the sound

Barenaked Ladies,"It's hard enough to notice
Harder still to react
Just a stone's throw from the center of our attention
We all fade to black

Save me from a villainous imagination
Deliver me from my friends
If I said something to make you mad
I will take it back

It's hard enough to stomach
But try to look away
Is this a news report or a trailer for a motion picture?
It all fades to gray

Save me from a villainous imagination
Deliver me from my friends
If I said something to make you mad
I will take it back

Long lines and warning signs
Think of all the lives saved by plastic knives
It's naive, but make believe
We will never lose if we remove our shoes

It's hard to keep your mouth shut
Harder still to make noise
But we can't have the perfect 20/20 hindsight
That our fate enjoys

Save me from a villainous imagination
Deliver me from my friends
If I said something to make you mad
I will take it back
I will take it back",Take It Back

Barenaked Ladies,"Everywhere I go someone's trying to be my girlfriend's best friend
I'm tryin' to pretend I'm relaxed but I'm playin' castonettes with my knees
I try to be cool and give her space but a guy's always there ready to jump right up and take my place
Everyone in this room seems to want to make a big fool outta me

Everybody open your mouth
Everybody just say ah (ah ah ah ah)
Everything will be alright if you play along

Everywhere I go there's someone in a trench coat staring at me
And when I'm not at home I'm sure someone's rummaging through my trash
What ever could they want from me?
Is it just a part of a giant government conspiracy?
I gotta go see my doctor about this itchy pentagram shaped rash

Everybody open your mouth
Everybody just say ah (ah ah ah ah)
Everything'll be alright, this won't hurt at all (turn it up)
Everybody get in line
Everybody turn and cough (ah ah)

Tryin' to finally find the only one in complete health
Consult contemporaries if there are some to see
There really isn't anyone who's in my lane

Every night at a lane, someone thinks they've got a find beyond me
I try to take three deep breaths as I walk up to my minivan
Everyone says I'm lookin' great but it's hard to stand up let alone to try to concentrate
I wish that everyone that I knew hadn't sold out to the man

Barenaked Ladies,"It's been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side
and said I'm angry
Five days since you laughed at me saying 
Get that together come back and see me
Three days since the living room,
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you
Yesterday you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days till I say I'm sorry

Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
As I make you stop, think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish,
Although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi 
Cause it's never touched a frying pan

Hot like wasabe when I bust rhymes
Big like Leann Rimes
Because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits
You try to hold me but I bust through

Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinkin', achin' shake 
I like vanilla, It's the finest of the flavors
Gotta see the show,
Cause then you'll know
The Vertigo is gonna grow
Cause it's so dangerous,
You'll have to sign a waiver

How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad
Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean?

I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt

It's been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air and said you're crazy
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees

Like Sting I'm Tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy

Like Kurosawa I make mad films
Okay I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a samurai
Gonna get a set of better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the backswing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon
Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes
That make me think the wrong thing

Dropped your arms to your sides and said I'm sorry
Five days since I laughed at you and said
You just did just what I thought you were gonna do
Three days since the living room
We realized we're both to blame, but what could we do?
Yesterday you just smiled at me
Cause it'll still be two days till we say we're sorry

It'll still be two days till we say we're sorry

Barenaked Ladies,"Some people are just all show
Well, I don't mind that if the show is worth watching
But it's all bark and no tree
What's more ironic than a hippie in Versace?
It's all peace and love and limousines
You got the right message, but the wrong intentions
How can you be touchy-feely when you've lost touch?
I think it's time we had a little intervention with you

And lose the makeup

When you don't know what it's worth
Now you really wanna show her 
How she's just so down to Earth (via satellite) 

There's no better friends than the, the kind you pay
If they don't balance, great - then the door will keep revolving
It's a tight circle of the chosen few
Well, how'd you manage that with the recipe involving
Just a pinch of sweetness and a cup of angst?
Mix it all up you're the all-purpose flour
Though it looks delicious, something smells bad

Knots can come undone,
I should grown but,
I was on the run,
And the walls were crumbling,

Such a hole in the ground,
There's no mistaking,
I will wear the crown,
I'm the lord and master,
Of this disaster.

These streets are dead just waiting to come alive

Break down the doors of our comfortable room
Tear down the walls we never could see through
Aren't we sick yet of missing out on life

Do we want more?
Tell me do we want more?

'Cause we've heard the cry and we'll come alive
And we fight for love and we live to die
Because a life that holds no meaning
Is like a day without the light
So we'll come alive tonight

All have the call but so few have listened
Life is too short you don't want to miss this
Make up your mind before life passes by

Now is the time to wake up and see this
World won't revolve around you and me
So let's be the change we've all been waiting for

We are the passion
We are the movement
We are the fire
We'll never lose it",Come Alive

Barnabas,"Survival is not guaranteed in strange, tumultuous times
When the quest of our humanity strays from the narrow line
The cause of world insanities rests deeply on the few
Whose self-inflicted vanities require your servitude

In days of lies and subterfuge are times most opportune
To drain the living aptitude from those who feel entombed 
A species cannot tolerate predation from within
With power indiscriminate and lack of discipline

So with the captains of these mighty nations awash in a sea of blind mistrust
The man on the street receives information designed to conceal the obvious
Throughout this madness, an offer of true and lasting peace
To soldier and philosopher, demoniac and priest

And when the curtain falls around us in megaton torment
Because the kings of men have failed again in obscene impudence
It will only be the ending of a strange, tumultuous dream
For those who've found the Saviour, waiting and willing",Subterfuge
Barnabas,"Spiritual warriors in life
Battles with sword in hand
I will fight the good fight in life
Conquering I'll make my stand
And overcome the ties that day by day the world hides
Knowing that I've found a place upon the solid ground

I'll always be a warrior
When I started to carry the warrior's sword
Evils came my way
Even though I would see defeat sometimes
I would never let it lead me astray
And I began to see the way true life could be
The opportunity to reach a perfect destiny

Look at it flutter and dance all around
Hear the wind blowing it high off the ground
Feel the string tugging and just hold on tight

I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names

Barney Kessel,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me

North and South and East and West of your life

""Romance is a game for fools""
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in
Open up your heart and let this fool rush in!",Fools Rush In

De que se estaba convirtiendo

RompiÃ³ todos los moldes con su aceptar
Un mundo tan vacÃ­o de creatividad
Se fue a buscar otros lugares
DejÃ³ su casa why su ciudad
Un caso perdido, un hombre sin moral
Un caso perdido para la sociedad.
VagÃ³ sin rumbo fijo
Quiso disfrutar viviÃ³ mil aventuras
Noches sin final
Nunca fue un hombre de negocios
Siempre se abstuvo de votar
Un caso perdido
Un hombre sin moral
Un caso perdido
Para la sociedad.
Hoy no se tiene que preocupar
De conservar un capital
Vive al dÃ­a en su refugio
No tiene nada que ocultar.
Cuentan que estando cerca su hora final
PasÃ³ de toda ayuda espiritual

You need someone willing to give their heart and soul to you
Promise you forever, baby that's something I can't do

Is the hardest thing to do

When chains are torn by courage born 
Of a love that's free 
A time when dreams so long denied 
Can flourish as we unveil 
The love we now must hide 

*A time for us at last to see 
A life worthwhile for you and me 
And with our love through tears and thorns 
We will endure as we pass surely 
Through every storm 
A time for us someday there'll be 
A new world, a world of shining hope 
For you and me

Barratt Waugh,"A ray of hope flickers in the sky 
A tiny star lights up way up high 
All across the land dawns a brand new morn', 
This comes to pass when a child is born. 

A silent wish sails the seven seas

The winds of change whisper in the trees 
And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn, 
This comes to pass when a child is born. 

A rosy dawn settles all around

You got to feel you're on solid ground 
For a spell or two no one seems forlorn 
This come to pass when a child is born. 

It's all a dream, an illusion now.

It must come true some time soon somehow 
All across the land dawns a brand new morn 
This comes to pass when a child is born.

There's no other name by which I'm saved
I've got the power it's in my sights
Because with him I'm not afraid to die

Now I will disclose his name, it's Jesus Christ

Why is our system of dating based on one man's death?
And why is the world upside-down
Cause of one man's life

They are the foolish and they are the ones who will burn, burn in hell

Do it now! You will live!

Feel the metal from inside my head
Feel the steel, take his flight
For when it leaves, heaven will be in sight

And if you believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead,
Then you will be saved and forgiven, you just have to ask

You don't have to go
Over the edge

Wait out your strife but don't take your life

I'm now in pieces in a garbage bag
Guilt will now take over
'Cause where is the relief you thought you had
The shame and tears she bears
The scar of guilt she is going to wear
But he can forgive her
If she gives her life to the saviour
No, no, they're gonna kill me
I don't want to die, just let me be

Barrence Whitfield,"Edith Piaf was the Little Sparrow 
She flew high above the Paris streets 
Saint of the bars and bistros 
Chanteuse of a tear-stained sheet 
She sang for the drunks and the sailor boys 
Who'd sunk as low as low can get 
I read she kicked a three-pack habit once 
On chocolate cigarettes

And she didn't have a smoke 
Though she wanted one 
Didn't take a drink 
Though it hurt her some 
She stared across the 
River Seine hummin' 
""No Regrets"" Pullin' on a chocolate cigarette

Oh, those chocolate cigarettes I've seen 'em in my youth 
There beside the Hershey bars, 
The Almond Joys, the Baby Ruths 
I kicked a three-pack habit once I won a hundred dollar bet 
With the help of chewin' gum 
And

And I didn't have a smoke 
Though I wanted one I didn't take a drink 
Though it hurt me some I thought of 
Little Sparrow hummin' 
""No Regrets"" Pullin' on a chocolate cigarette

It's an Edith Piaf night tonight 
As I put her records on 
All that smoky passion 
In every line of every song 
Old love affairs and wasteful habits 
We'll all survive them yet 
Memories drown in coffee grounds 
And chocolate cigarettes

She didn't have a smoke 
Though she wanted one 
She didn't take a drink 
Though it hurt her some 
She stared across the River Seine hummin' 
""No Regrets""

Barrence Whitfield,"He was born in 1890, on the Gulf of Mexico 
Fought his way around the world with hand, and heart, and soul 
So trot out all your Great White Hopes, 
But they'd better bring a gun 
Jack Johnson's made of iron he's all counter punch and run

Yonder comes Jack Johnson 
Like he owns the town 
There's a lot of white American's 
Like to see that man fall down 
Like to see a black man drown

Jack stood on the Titanic pier with a thousand dollar roll 
But the captain said, 
""Sorry, Boy, we ain't haulin' coal"" 
So Jack danced the Eagle Rock in a tavern on the shore 
While the captain danced his final dance on the Atlantic Ocean floor

Yonder comes Jack Johnson 
Like he owns the town 
There's a lot of white American's 
Like to see that man fall down 
Like to see a black man drown

Jack Johnson beat Jim Jeffries, till there weren't nothin' left 
And every time he'd throw a punch he'd say, 
""Package for Mr. Jeff!"" 
The he ran off with some white girl, man that made 'em mad 
All agreed and all decreed, that Black Man was bad

Yonder comes Jack Johnson Like he owns the town 
There's a lot of white American's 
Like to see that man fall down 
Like to see a black man drown

I don't think he'd mind 'Cause Lead Belly and Jack, 
They were cut from the same vine",Jack Johnson

There's songs and poems and promises and dreams that might come true
But I won't talk of starry skies or moonlight on the ground
I'll come right out and tell you I'd just love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around
Oh darlin' how I'd love to lay you down

There's so many ways your sweet love made this house into a home
You've got a way of doing little things that really turn me on

You'll still be beautiful and I'll still be around

Baby last night was hands down
One of the best nights
That I've had no doubt
Between the bottle of wine
And the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern lights
If I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man, oh yes I could

Baby that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You're a saint, you're a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, the masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you
In my wildest dreams

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
What I need in this life is your crazy love
I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
You're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Or dance around the fireplace

If I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California

And a smile can hide all the pain

Where your kiss filled me with thrills

Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

 That saved a wretch like me.

 Was blind but now I see. 
 T'was grace that taught my heart to fear 
 And grace my fear relieved 
 How precious did that grace appear, 
 The hour I first believed. 
 Through many dangers, toils and snares 
 We have already come 
 T'was grace that brought us safe thus far 
 And grace will lead us home. 
 When we've been there ten thousand years 
 Bright shining as the sun; 
 We've no less days to sing God's praise 
 Than when we first begun",Amazing Grace

[Chorus]
There's a long train rollin'
And a blue moon above
You switched me back, I jumped the track
On that railroad of love
You engineered my sadness
You treated me so cruel
Now I'm just another rider
On your long train of fools

Things kept movin' faster
We had love to burn
Thought we were on the same track
But you took a different turn
And now that it's all over
I ask myself sometimes
How many others have you taken down that line?",Long Train of Fools
Barry & Holly Tashian,"Before you take another step there's something you should know
About the years ahead and how they'll be
You'll be living in a world where roses hardly ever grow
Cause all I have to offer you is me
There'll be no mansion waiting on the hill with crystal chandeliers
Then there'll be no fancy clothes for you to wear
Everything I have is standing here in front of you to see
All I have to offer you is me

Sweetheart I'll give you all my love in every way I can

Barry Crocker,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura
Barry Crocker,"Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

Barry Dixon,"Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl 
With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there 
She would merengue and do the cha-cha 
And while she tried to be a star 
Tony always tended bar 
Across the crowded floor, they worked from 8 til 4 
They were young and they had each other 
Who could ask for more? 

At the copa (CO!) Copacabana (Copacabana) 
The hottest spot north of Havana (here) 
At the copa (CO!) Copacabana 
Music and passion were always in fashion 
At the copa they fell in love 

His name was Rico 
He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola, 
Still in dress she used to wear, 
Faded feathers in her hair 
She sits there so refined,and drinks herself half-blind 
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony 
Now she's lost her mind 

At the copa don't fall in love 
Don't fall in love",At the Cross
Barry Gibb,"She says she loves me
And you say you don't
And life has no meaning
If you won't

She's one in a million
A million to one
And love makes us so much stronger
We hide the sun

It's undercover
You'll discover
We have lived a lie
I never meant a thing to you
All I did was waste your time

If it hurts, don't let it
Someone loves you
You will find the way

She says she loves me
And you say you don't
And life has no meaning
If you won't

The one road to heaven
Is hell when she's gone
And love makes us so much stronger
We hide the sun

It's wrong to go on blaming someone
You don't even know
One song was all she sang to me
All her words were soft and low

If it hurts, don't let it
Someone loves you
You will find the way

She says she loves me
And you say you don't

Barry Gibb,"Now I like the way you move
Anyway that you make it work
And you offer something new
And the doorway is open for me

Now a man needs a woman
And I know that for me is true
And life, we got too much reality
There's gotta be other things to do

Me electrify you
Simply mystify you
Very strange but nice

Now somebody wrong
And somebody right
And somebody knows
it's neither one thing or the other

It's a fine line
between taking and giving
It's a fine line

It's fine line
between dancing and making love
It's a fine line

I can see the possibility
Anyway that you wanna be
We all got secret emotions
Anytime after the midnight hour

Now love, don't get short on the action
Anyway you got the energy
My heart is a part of the plans you made
You're the star of my sexual fantasy

Me electrify you
Simply mystify you
Hope you stay all night

I'll have you for dinner
or breakfast in bed

Either way I get you
for the worse or for the better

It's a fine line
between taking and giving
It's a fine line

It's a fine line
between dancing and making love
It's a fine line

Oh oh

It's wild, it's weird, it's what we think about
This ain't no strip, club, shame on you 'cause
you know somebody that got a bead on what you need
Don't sacrifice your love
You analyze, don't minimize
what only you can rise above

Now, I know that, don't you think
I know you're watching me
You got no claim to make
Well, that's no excuse
And know the truth
You got brain drain, long as there's a game to play
Sad, but there's only one fool to blame

It's a fine line, fine line

You don't think my love should tie you down
I say love can turn your groove around
Watch me please you
Watch me play your game
Someday love will make your water flow

It's a fine line, fine line",Fine Line
Barry Gibb,"On the dark side of the street
Just about midnight on the way
to the bright side when she calls

She turned out the light

from a number on the wall

All God's children
need someone to love
And you know, you know I found mine

I've been waiting for the one
After her you will see me gone
I got a question answered anyway
She turned out to be a lesson in love
A lesson in love

Bad girls cross the line
Get it for nothing anytime
I am a victim of the blues

She don't know the truth
Nobody told her how to cry
She got a back against the wall

All God's children need someone to love
And you know, baby, you know I found mine

She can show me I'm the one
After me she'll be on the run
And lightning strikes in my bedroom
The satisfaction was to me a lesson in love


If you give your love for the first time
A lesson in love

Barry Gibb,"I send you down my love tonight
on a dream that I can hold you near.
Will the message in your eyes
take shape and crystalize?
Or will you disappear?
That feeling when you sigh.
I could not want you more.

Ah, so close and yet so far.
And you know it's where we are.
And the moment I have waited for.

The rhythm of the turning tide,
and every star that shines in harmony,
like the fairy tale you read,
like the only heart you need,
is here inside of me.

And we are held in time.
Your love lost in mine.

There is no yesterday.
Just the music on the bay.
We can lie together.
Make forever..

One night for lovers.
Kiss your lover tonight.

On a night like this you lie awake,
and no one can tell you why
you fall in love, and love takes over
with no goodbye.

I'm dancing in your arms.
Tonight I'd give my life for you
if you were...

Mia, no te voy a hacer llorar. (Mine, I won't make you cry)
Dime lo que quieres, mi amor (Tell me what you want, my love)

It's the way it has to be.
If I get you close to me
I will not let you go.

Say you'll be in my arms.
Don't make me wait so long.

Ah, love me with your lips.
Touch me with your touch.
Fill me up with one anticipation.

One night for lovers.
Kiss your lover tonight.

On a night like this you lie awake
and no one can tell you why
you fall in love and love takes over
and there is no goodbye.

I'm dancing in your arms
and I'm close enough to know,
you make me yours,
and you,
you're mine.
You're mine.

And the wonder of it all,
when tomorrow comes, I call you mine.
I'm the promise you fulfill.
In a lifetime you will still be mine.",One Night
Barry Gibb,"There she was
She dragged my heart around
No desire to hurt you, girl
I gave it all before I found
The damage had been done

Burning love
I was too weak to fight
Searching fingers in the night
I should have been a stronger man
But I was overcome

Someone can steal your dream
You know love is blind
I can't lose you now
Or I lose my mind

Hold me like you know
Stay inside my soul
It's my love and your love goes to show

That's right, that's right
You blame it on temptation
It happens all the time

That's right, that's right
You blame it on temptation
It happens all the time

I was wrong
So wrong to make you cry
All your friends may tell you why
you and I should say goodbye
the way that people do

Jealous words
Don't let them kill the flame
I won't let you forget my name
And no one feels the same way
that I feel for you

Live for you all my life
Live your night and day
With you on my side
I can't lose my way

I'll be a shoulder for you
Be a man of steel
That woman's gone
She was just a dream
And you are real

That's right, that's right

Save me from temptation eyes

Barry Gibb,"You took a mystery and made me want it 
You got a pedestal and put me on it 
You made me love you out of feeling nothing 
Something that you do 
And I was there and not dancing with anyone 
You took a little, then you took me over 
You set your mark on stealing my heart away 
Crying, trying, anything for you 

I'm in the middle of a chain reaction 
You give me all the after midnight action 
I want to get you where I can let you make all that love to me 
I'm on a journey for the inspiration 
To anywhere and there ain't no salvation 
I need you to get me nearer to you 
So you can set me free 
We talk about love, love, love 
We talk about love 
We talk about love, love, love 
We talk about love 

You make me tremble when your hand moves lower 
You taste a little then you swallow slower 
Nature has a way of yielding treasure 
Pleasure made for you, oh 
You gotta plan, your future is on the run 
Shine a light for the whole world over 
You never find your love if you hide away 
Crying, dying, all you gotta do is 

Get in the middle of a chain reaction 
You get a medal when you're lost in action 
I want to get your love all ready for the sweet sensation 
Instant radiation 
You let me hold you for the first explosion 
We get a picture of our love in motion 
My arms will cover, my lips will smother you 
With no more left to say 
We talk about love, love, love 
We talk about love 
You let me hold you for the first explosion 
My arms will cover you 

All you gotta do is get in the middle of a chain reaction 
You get a medal when you're lost in action 
Don't pass me by 
I want to get your love all ready for the chain reaction",Chain Reaction

All my life was so wrapped up in you
And I could only wish
That you could feel the way I do

I found a love and I can't get enough
To have you suddenly
Standing right in front of me

I may be lonely but I'm not alone
And we don't need conversation
I'm only happy when I hear you moan
You speak the pleasure within

In my heart, in my soul, in the now

We claimed last summer darlin'
You began to slowly bend my way
Love is like it, we got no shame
And time is standing still

You were what I'm searching for

In my heart, in my soul, in the now
In my heart, in my soul, in the now

This is the story of what might have been
It's just my imagination
I made it up instead of givin' in 
In the now

I may be crazy but I'm not alone
I call it intoxication
They say tomorrow is another day

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday

To see what I could see

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

I've been down since you went away
It wasn't love, but it felt okay

My head is numb, I've been up all night
I stood there seein' the mornin' light
Can't explain what I feel inside
I wanna run and I wanna hide

My shattered hopes on the telephone line
I hope you're picking it up this time
It's only dreams that I hold onto
Dreams are all that I had with you

Memories and dreams of love
Days I had with you
I never thought it'd be so tough
To feel the way I do

Over you

Livin' high and without a care
You and I we were almost there
Can't explain what it meant to me
Every night was a fantasy

I've been down since you went away

It wasn't love, but it felt okay
Lookin' out in the mornin' light
Was it only a dream that night

Livin' out all your fantasies
I've been down since you went away
It wasn't love, but it felt okay

My head is numb, I've been up all night
I stood there seein' the mornin' light
Can't explain what I feel inside
I wanna run and I wanna hide

My shattered hopes on the telephone line
I hope you're picking it up this time
It's only dreams that I hold onto
Dreams are all that I had with you

Dreams are all that I had with you
Dreams are all that I had with you
Dreams are all that I had with you",Dreams

You were only waiting for this moment to arise.

Take these sunken eyes and learn to see

You were only waiting for this moment to be free.

Into the light of the dark black night.

Barry Harris,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes
Barry Harris,"Oooooh... 

It happened the moment, when you were revealed 
'Cause you were a dream that you should not have been 
A fantasy real 
You gave me this beating baby 
This rhythm inside 
And you made me feel good and feel nice and feel loved 
Give me paradise 

So shouldn't I realize 
You're the highest of the high 
If you don't know, then I'll say it 
So don't ever wonder 

Shouldn't I realize 
You're the highest of the high 
If you don't know, then I'll say it

How long it's gonna take until you speak, babe 
'Cause I can't live my life 
Without you here by my side 
Ooh...

Barry Harris,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

We're dancing in the dark and it soon ends,
We're waltzing in the wonder of why we're here,

To brighten up the night, I have you love,
And we can face the music together,

Barry Harris,"Once I was young
Yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul
And kissed some other chaps

Once I was young
But never was naive
I thought I had a trick or two
Up my imaginary sleeve
And now I know I was naive

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too

I didn't know what day it was
You held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say, ""I'm all your own""

I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes
I'm wise and I know what time it is now

To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch

Barry Harris,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love
Barry Harris,"I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stopped right there

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Barry Harris,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Barry Harris,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now
Barry Harris,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely

Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath

I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

I never miss a thing

And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me

I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?

Because my gal had turned me down.
Then we met and you can bet

I hope that we two will never say ""Good-bye.""

And your kissn' and your huggin'
And your sweet turtle-dovin' pretty baby.
I won't be satisfied til I hear 'em play,

Listen to me baby and I don't mean maybe.
Listen to my story, it's terrifficly true.
I gotta find a way of telling
You that I really go for you.
I hope you really believe me baby
'cause I certainly do.

'Cause you're thrillin' me, you're really,
Really thrilling when you tell me
That you probably got a kind of crush on me,
That moves me, grooves me.
How divine can one woman be?

Well little darlin', you got me fallin'.
You got me goofy and gay.
I'm gonna get carried away.
Just think, you're gonna be mine someday.

Park a little, stop a little,
Spark a little, live a little, love a little,
Maybe turtle-dove a little baby.

Nobody loves me like you, dear.

Let's stop a little, squeeze a little,
Probably maybe tease a little,
Try a little, sigh a little,
Maybe have to cry a little bit,
'cause to tell you the truth,
I'm gonna love you and that's it.

'Cause I love you baby,
Love you baby, love you baby, love you baby,

I know, pretty baby,

How do you cause the cloud to burst?

Find a lover, find a lover, find a lover.

If it's silvery under clouds of gray.
How do you chase the clouds away?
You gotta find a little girl
And make her love you a lot.
Don't ever leave unless you flip your
Lid and really want to ruin the plot.

Sounds easy does it?
Light as a breeze thru the trees.
Boy, how pleasant was it?

Barry Manilow,"She's a great little housewife
Though sometimes she talks like a fool
But she helps at the store in the holiday rush
And she picks up the kids after school
And she puts down the phone
When her husband comes home

And she changes from mother to wife
'Til she feels the words hanging between them
And she hangs by her words to her life

She says I swear I love my husband,
I love my kids
I wanted to be like my mother
But if I hadn't done it as soon as I did
Oh there might have been time to be me
For myself, for myself

There's so many things that she wishes
She don't even know what she's missin'
And that's how she knows that she missed

She's a sweetheart, except when she's moody
It's hard to get through to her then
Depressed for a while
When the youngest was born
Oh but that happens now and again

She might take a drink with the housework
Or when Michael's kept late at the shop
A Martini or two before dinner
But she always knows when to stop

She says I swear I love my husband
And I love my kids
You know I wanted to be like my mother
But if I hadn't done it as soon as I did

Now it's seldom if ever they go
Once you've paid for the sitter
And parkin' the car
There's no money left for the show

She was doing the dishes
When a glass fell and broke on the tile
And she cut her wrist (quite by mistake)
It was real touch and go for a while

And I love my kids
You know I wanted to be like my, my mother

Wasting away, making believe 
There's a reason to stay together 

Now, we're happy to sit, 
Night after night The two of us 
Convinced that it's right, hiding the yawns 
Somehow getting along together 

Afraid we'd always be alone 
We made a home that we could always share 
Just to know that someone would be there 
Even if we never learned to care

Barry Manilow,"I was looking out the window just this morning.
Wasn't finding inspiration in my bed.
I was wondering if all this was a warning,
'Cause I'd rather waste the day than work instead.

It's been quite a while since I could feel my heart beat.
I appreciate you offering me yours,
But I got to use my own and let it guide me.
It's the only thing to get me home for sure.

Let's hear some good news for the lady.
She's coming out from far behind
And if she seems a little slow,
It only goes to show
That everything will grow in its own time

Well I haven't really lost my sense of humor;
(say) it all depends on where you're coming from.
But I would tend to give some credence to the rumor
That this bird in flight just might be on the run.

Let's hear some good news for the lady.
She's coming out from far behind.
So if she seems a little slow,
It only goes to show
That everything will grow in its own time

I sort of hope you'll understand (that I've been there before)
That I can't always join the band you want
And if I hide behind the words I'm saying,
Don't let it fool you; you're not comin' through.

I need some good news for my lady.
She's coming up and wants to shine.
So if she needs the time to pause,
Just give her room because
She'll be comin' round the mountain in her time.
(You know) everything will grow in its own time.",Good News [#]

Yeah, she likes to leave 'em hungry, 
Yeah she loves to hear 'em yell!

you're pretty as a picture

Why don't you see the show again.
I've been singin these love songs forever
Sometimes the words don't make much sense
So I'm living it all through the music
Using last nights compliments
I've been playing for thousands of people
Sometimes, it just never ends.
But the look in your eyes feels so good to me
Why don't you see the show again.
God knows, there's not much I can say
I don't have time for love in my life
But if I ever thought, about changin my mind
It might be with you, tonight.
I've been on the road, for so many weeks now
And I'm losin track of time?
Tryin? to make everyone happy

Your side of the bed is cold
I haven't slept a wink

To the face inside my drink
Lay me down and roll me out to sea

Got your picture in my wallet
And some pictures in my mind
A pocketful of memories
I never thought I'd find
And it's rainin' like a Monday
And the world seems so unkind
So lay me down and roll me out to sea

Roll me out to sea

Cause I haven't told it all

When they asked, ""How ya' doing?""

While making love in some hotel
I am a part of you

You'll never know my name

I am the strings that enter softly
Or three guitars that glitter gold
I am the thousand trumpet lines
That were an afterthought
Intended eyes,
The way to get a dying record sold
I never ride the road
I never play around
I played what they set down

I'm a working musician
Living from week to week
I'm the voice through each empty men
Tried to speak
A studio musician
Blowin' the chance I see

And when the woodwind coushing rises
I start to dream
With the low brass bed
But I awake the horns

We're up the letter D

I'm a man of the moment

Or things I never said

There on you side of the bed
Remember when we used to talk so much
I think we're losing touch

Who had ever guessed, that we could fall
After all the things we had in common
Where they too common after all?

Won't you tell me what's wrong

And I like what I said, and I liked what I heard
And I started to think, I could think about starting again

We where laughing again over memories and wine
And the years in between didn't seem along time
When I smile she knew why in awhile it was starting again

And I started to think, I could feel again
All the bad times seemed unreal
When she looked in my eyes
The cheating, the lies, the things that were wrong seem far behind

Then I started to think, I could care again
And my fears all disappeared
When she called me by name, I knew that she changed
The flaws were all gone, the saint remained

But it started again when I asked her to stay
And she said there's this friend who's in town just for today
And she really felt bad but she had to be leavin' again

And she left me again as she left me before
Still pretending she cared when we kissed at the door
But I saw in her eyes that the lies were all starting again

Just when I'd started to feel again
When all the bad times seemed unreal
When it all seemed so right
And I tough that tonight if she said she cared

She really might just when my fears disappeared again
And I heard what I wanted to hear it all started again
And I knew what that meant
It wasn't the start, it was really the end

Music and passion were always in fashion

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl
But that was thirty years ago, when they used to have a show
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola
Still in dress she used to wear
Faded feathers in her hair
She sits there so refined, and drinks herself half-blind
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony
Now she's lost her mind

Barry Manilow,"Hello, my friends I've been neglecting you awhile
Maybe now, we'll know each other better
Time has a way of always turning up a smile
Now, I've got the time to know you better

I'm not as crazy as I used to be
Some of my devils upped and left me free
To find a quite space
I'm not as out of place

I'm not as lonely as I was before
I don't go [Incomprehensible] there's an open door to leave by
I'm starting to believe my own existence
Has a right to be

And I'm coming home again
It's been too long a time, getting back what's mine
And I can't remember why I went away
But it's looking now like maybe I can stay

The poets cry for dreams they never saw
The only certainty is nothing sure
And nothing stays the same
Go back where they came

And though my answers are still undefined
By taking chances, I can start to find some reasons
Something to believe that I can make it through
I can make it through

And I'm coming home again
It's been too long a time, getting back what's mine
And I can't remember why I went away
But it's looking now like maybe I can stay

And I can't remember why I went away
But it's looking now like maybe I can stay

Barry Manilow,"Not even ambition
Led her right in to the palm of his hand
Not that she didn't know better
But she never been out on the streets before

Lost in her ambition
She just had to know the good and the bad
So she took a apartment
And spend all the money she didn't have

[Chorus:]
No love for Jenny
She's wasting her smile
Takeing a chance that it's all worth her while
Dancing for strangers
Thinking she's grown up
Loving so many
But no love for Jenny

Fakeing dependents
Kept her right on top of his list
Makeing some really good money
But knowing it won't last very long
A happy birthday
What away to spend your sweet 16
Saying she's 20 but looking like 30
Hey what went wrong

Looks like we made it
Left each other on the way to another love
Looks like we made it

And all I could taste was love the way we made it

There's nothin' gonna stop or stall her
And luck is on her side tonight
They're pullin' over to the curb to call her
Man, she loves these city lights

So what's the difference
I gotta live
I gotta be somebody
And I wanna go where the apples grow
And all I need is the money
Hey mister, smile and buy my time
And I don't want you fillin' funny
Just think of Bonnie Lee like a busy bee
Gettin' by by sellin' honey

She's got this picture of her brother
That she took when she left home
She rolled her hair up like her mother
With her mother's ivory comb
She was sweet sixteen last Easter
But she know how to treat you right
Tomorrow she's gonna be in the movies
But she won't forget tonight

There's another that rides far behind

She'd never find a man like him again
So she closed the door and never looked any more
So of course she's been alone since then

She gave in to the blues
So you know she just had to lose
Soon as she gave in to the blues

There's a man who won't try her, why
He says only fools even play the game
Never have the breaks, the money that it takes
So he says he's not to blame

Started to drink, the day he started to think
The world was out to bring him down for good
So he close the door and drank a little bit more
And went down just like they said he would

He gave in to the blues
So you know he just had to lose
Soon as he give in to the blues

No, no, don't you give in to the blues

I let myself believe that you would stay
I swore I'd never do this, go through this again
But I let myself believe and now I can't believe you've gone away

I should have learnt from times before
Why can't I stop myself from coming back for more?
I fall too fast, I say too much, my heart is on my sleeve and then

I let myself believe again
I let myself believe that you could love me
I let myself believe that you would stay
Though I swore I'd never do this, go through this again
But I let myself believe and now I can't believe

The signs are always there as they were with you
And still I did what I always do

Barry Manilow,"Goodbye there's a word I've hated all my life.
Unanticipated tears can hurt so much
My friend, it's so sad to see you at love's end
I've been through the pain myself it's really wrong
To play it strong.

Go on and cry till you run dry it's alright.
Go on and scream at broken dreams it's alright.
Let sorrow have its day and when its done
Life will go on.

In time thoughts of ""might have been"" will leave your mind
And sweet forgetfulness will come
Don't worry now just when or how

Go and cry till you run dry it's alright
Go on and scream at broken dreams it's alright.
Let sorrow have its day to cry out is no crime
In no time life will go on.

Go on and cry till you run day it's alright.
Go on and scream at broken dreams it's alright.
Let sorrow have its day and when it's done
Life will go on and on.

It's alright oh it's alright.
Let sorrow have its day and when it's done
Life will go on and on",Life Will Go On
Barry Manilow,"New York winter Traffic squeals
The city feels...so old
Late December taxi ride
Then run inside it's cold

Got your letters Monday
I think or Tuesday
I lose track
Since then I've been thinking of you
And I've been looking back to

London
Can you believe it's so many years since
London
Hitching a ride and carrying knapsacks
London
In the park by the Thames Drinking tea
London
Sitting in pubs and living in walk-ups
London
Learnin' the accent learnin' to love you
London
We were young we were sure
We were... free

Was it really ages
Ago the memories Never fade
Can you hear Big Ben where you are
And are you glad you stayed in

London
Dodging the rain with broken umbrellas
London
Readind the Times on Saturday picnics
London
Counting stars 'till the stars
All were gone

London
So many plans and nothing but time in
London
Nothing to fear 'cause nothing could last in
London
We grew close we grew scared
I moved on

Oh London
What were we scared of
Why did I run from London
Part of me still has
Never come back from London
Is it fair that I miss
You so much

Take good care all my love
Keep in touch
New York winter taxi ride
Then run inside it's cold

Barry Manilow,"Your eyes are sad eyes
Mine are too
It doesn't take to much to see
What we've been through

You lost your baby
And me the same
Ain't it true how love's a hurtin' game

Could I have this dance
May I be so bold
It's just my arms are empty
And the night is so cold

[Chorus]
Wouldn't it be fine bein' lonely together
Wouldn't it be fine havin' a shoulder to share
You could tell me how he broke your heart
And I'll tell you how she broke mine
And maybe later on I could take you home
Now wouldn't it be sad bein' lonely all alone

A heart that's hurtin's
Not to hard to see
I guess he promised you the world
Like she did me

But dry your eyes now
You'll be just fine
We can drown our achin' hearts in this glass of wine

Well I hate to say
What's done is done
It's just two could ease the pain
Much better than one

[Chorus]

Love
It's such a crazy thing
All you gotta give and no regrets
But love

It can live again
Stay with me tonight
I'll make it work out right

[Chorus: x2]",Lonely Together
Barry Manilow,"I went back
Yes I went back to find out
What we did wrong
And I went back
Yes I went back to see just
How we could feel so good
In Chicago we seemed to have it all
It was real, it was real

I went back
And I sat by the lake
And looked at the stars
And oh I swear
I remember how much we laughed
And I loved you so
In Chicago I know we had it all
It was real, it was love

Only in Chicago
Love is in the air in Chicago
There's a magic there in Chicago
Our Chicago
Baby, you and I, we tried to take it with us

But you can't go back
‘Cause I went back to find out
What we did wrong and now I see
That it wasn't just you
It wasn't just you it was in Chicago
But I'm still in love with you
Only you, only you, but only in Chicago",Only in Chicago
Barry Manilow,"I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna write words oh so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet
A lot of kisses on the bottom, I'll be glad I got 'em

I'm gonna smile and say I hope you're feeling better
And close with love the way you do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you

Barry Manilow,"I'm not the man I used to be, fell down a time or two
When luck was lookin' out for me
I missed the knock and never knew I let you go
But you can't get away from me again

Do you want me to plead? Do you want me to cry?
Any proof that you need, any promise you'll buy
Do you want me to break down the door?
Do you want me to break down the door?
Break down the door

You say you saw me lose control, look now I'm in the lead
And you can have my heart and soul
I'm overhauled and guaranteed, what do you say?
Why don't you take a chance on me again?

Do you want me to plead? Do you want me to cry?
Any proof that you need, any promise you'll buy
Do you want me to break down the door?
Do you want me to break down the door?
Break down the door

Can't say for sure what's comin'
It ain't what's gone before
Except we had some damn good times
And I know we both want more

Do you want me to plead? Do you want me to cry?
Any proof that you need, any promise you'll buy
Do you want me to break, do you want me to break down?
Do you want me to break down the?
Do you want me to break down the door?

Barry Manilow,"She was just a girl who knew the way
I was so naive
Everything she ever said to me
I wanted to believe
I was close to too far gone
When she sat down and
Told me tenderly

Don't fall in love with me
I'll only break your heart
For us forever is just tomorrow
Don't fall in love with me
Don't let the fire start
If you should fall
I'm afraid I'll follow you

Now I'm on the other side of love
Lookin' right at you
There you are so young and sure
Your life has room enough for two
So it's up to me to try and say
Words that didn't stop me yesterday

Don't fall in love with me
I'll only break your heart
For us forever is just tomorrow
Don't fall in love with me
Don't let the fire start
If you should fall
I'm afraid I'll follow you",Don't Fall in Love With Me
Barry Manilow,"When I see you lying there
Like a living answered prayer
There are no words
For what I feel for you
My life was once a high trapeze
You pulled me down
And gave me peace
That's something no one else
Could ever do
And on nights like tonight
It scares me recalling
How close I came to falling

[Chorus]
But fools get lucky
Fortune must like me
When people ask where you came from
I tell them that
Fools get lucky
Destiny likes me

It must be one of nature's rules
Love like yours
Should save the fools like me
When I see the good times shine
On this wayward life of mine
I tell the world
It's all because of you

Like me",Fools Get Lucky
Barry Manilow,"Here is the room that we shared 
The room that you cared for 
So I haven't changed the room 
How did the years slip away 
I could swear you're still there 
For I haven't changed the room 

Now that you're gone 
What am I to do 
So many fantasies 
Plans that we made 
That will never come true 

And I haven't changed all that much 
And I'm sure you'd be proud of 
The way that I came through 
So if you happen to be passin' by 
To make sure that you recognize it 
I haven't changed the room",I Haven't Changed the Room
Barry Manilow,"Oh my love 
You were the only one 
Now you're gone and I'm alone 
All my friends 
They say what's done is done 
I pretend 
But deep inside I know 

If I should love again 
If I find someone new 
It would be make-believe 
For in my heart 
It would be you 
And though I hold her close 
And want her now and then 
I'll still be loving you 
If I should love again 

All day long 
I keep remembering 
All the night 
I think of you 
All my life 
You'll be the song I sing 
I'll get by 
But this I swear is true 

If I should love again 
If I find someone new

You know I want to stay
How I want to stay

So let's take all night

Why don't we
Make this the sweetest of memories

Is all we have

Barry Manilow,"There were no violins
There were no soft guitars
Hot summer love under the city stars
I was Mr. Dynamite
And you were my only girl
We held each other through the night
Caught in a whirl

No other love
In all of the world
In all of my life
There was no other love

There was no fireside
No Beaujolais for two
Winter was cold but we had me and you
All the words we used to say
All the crazy plans we made
We were so naive that way
So unafraid

No other love
In all of the world
In all of my life
There was no other love

I don't know where it went
Turned into yesterday
Time comes and goes like music in a play
Looking back I still don't know
Why we ever had to end
And it's so hard letting go
Of what we had then

No other love
In all of the world
In all of my life There was no other love",No Other Love
Barry Manilow,"We had the right love at the wrong time
Guess I always knew inside
I wouldn't have you for a long time

Those dreams of yours are shining on distant shores
And if they're calling you away 
I have no right to make you stay

But somewhere down the road
Our roads are gonna cross again
It doesn't really matter when
But somewhere down the road
I know that heart of yours will come to see
That you belong with me

Sometimes goodbyes are not forever
It doesn't matter if you're gone
I still believe in us together
I understand more than you think I can
You have to go out on your own
So you can find your way back home

But somewhere down the road
Our roads are gonna cross again
It doesn't really matter when
But somewhere down the road
I know that heart of yours will come to see
That you belong with me

Letting go is just another way to say 
I'll always love you so

We had the right love at the wrong time
Maybe we've only just begun 
Maybe the best is yet to come

Well, not too long ago in 1944
When every mother's son was goin' off to war
They had to lift they spirits high (High)

In hot spots in the Bronx
They went to hear the kind of jazz

Mixed with bar light 

Listen 
The empty streets echo the night song 
A melody I used to think was only for the lonely 

Night song I hear you 
Now as the night disappears 
But this time your blues 
Is music to my ears 

The rumble of a train 
The rustle of the wind 
The rhythm of the footsteps 
The blarin' of a horn 
The murmur of a voice 
The echo of a siren 
Night song! 

You used to find me cryin' in my beer 
Now you remind me tomorrow she'll be here 
She'll be here! 
Oh, night song 

You sing of a train from New Orleans 
And deep in the music I hear her hummin' 
Now she's comin' home! 

The city is singin' its night song 
Listen",Night Song
Barry Manilow,"The night is new 
The faces are friendly 
So have a few 
And let me play 
Some new songs, some blue songs 
The mood is always right 
Every night at the Paradise Cafe 

The world outside 
May make its own madness 
But here we hide 
The world away 
No headlines, no deadlines 
We'll make them disappear 
While you're here at the Paradise Cafe

The room is kinda smokey 
The phone ain't workin' 
The same old broken keys don't play 
But no one seems to mind it 
'cause someone's buyin' 
And we'll all get through one more day 

Just me and you Around the piano 
Not much to do But dream away 
So stay on I'll play on 
I'm all yours for a song 
All night long at the Paradise Cafe 

Forget the one who loved you 
Then lied and left you 
Forget the love you almost had 
But if you must remember 
The way it left you 
We'll make it feel good to feel bad 

Just me and you around the piano",Paradise Café
Barry Manilow,"Say no more 
You know we've been here before 
Quiet, sleep now 
Baby, say no more 

Say no more 
Don't you tell me what's in store 
I know you must go 
Oh love, say no more 

You know how much I love you 
Just how much I care 
Place no one above you 
No one else is there 
Try to live my own life 
?cause I know your game 
Still it's been a long night 
And the night drives me insane 

Say no more 
Come inside and close the door 
Hold me, close now 
But please say no more",Say No More
Barry Manilow,"What am I doin' here 
Alone in this lonely house 
This house that we dreamed about 
This house we shared till you walked out 

What am I doin' here 
This place ain't no good for me 
It just brings back memories 
And the last things I need is memories 

I should be movin' on 
Wath am I doin' here 
Now that you've really gone 
Why can't I dry these tears 
But oh, the years we had 
Here is this house that we both loved so madly 

I've never been like this 
Just livin' in yesterdays 
But there's so much I miss 
And so much that I still can't face 

If there's a chance for me 
I just can't see it now 
All I see is what can't be 
And all I see is no way out",What Am I Doin' Here
Barry Manilow,"When love is gone 
What good is candlelight 
Each lonely day 
Becomes a sleepless night 
No one is there to share the rising dawn 
And so it fades away when love is gone 

When love is gone 
Life's just a hollow shell 
The stars don't shine 
The moon has lost its spell 
That old familiar ache 
that makes the night so long 
just seems to linger on when love is gone 

When love is gone 
There's just the memories 
An empty heart where love once used to be 
Those lonely blues refuse to let you carry on 
It's just that way each day when love is gone",When Love Is Gone
Barry Manilow,"And when October goes
The snow begins to fly
Above the smoky roofs
I watch the planes go by

The children running home beneath
A twilight sky
Oh, for the fun of them
When I was one of them

And when October goes
The same old dream appears
And you are in my arms
To share the happy years
I turn my head away to hide 
The helpless tears
Oh, how I hate to see October go

And when October goes
The same old dream appears
And you are in my arms
To share the happy years
I turn my head away to hide 
The helpless tears
Oh, how I hate to see October go

I should be over it now, I know
It doesn't matter much how old I grow
I hate to see October go",When October Goes
Barry Manilow,"Where have you gone 
It's been so long 
Winter's turned into spring 
And you're still not with me 
So far away sweet yesterday 
Love came' round but couldn't stay 

Where have you gone 
Do you still care 
Rainy April regrets 
All this pain and sorrow 
Let me find some other kind 
Some sweet love that's right this time 

Friends, dear hearts all around me 
But deep in my soul I'm cold as stone 
Once true love found me 
Now I'm so alone 

Where have you gone 
Where are you now 
It's so hard to forget 
All those magic moments 
I still sing our song 
Still holding on to love 
Where have you gone",Where Have You Gone
Barry Manilow,"Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I've got your picture hanging on the wall
But it can't see or come to me
When I call your name
I realize it's just a picture in a frame

I read your letters when you're not here
But they don't move me and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice
Whispering in my ear

Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I play my game of fantasy
And I pretend that I'm not in reality
I need the shelter
Of your arms to comfort me

No other sound
Is quite the same as your name
No touch can do quite as much
To make me feel better
So let's stay together

I've got the memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone
I'm well aware
But nothing can take the place of your being there

So glad we've got the real thing, baby
So glad we've got the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing",Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing
Barry Manilow,"Feel the heat tonight
Everything so right
Let's get together
At the dance

Turn down all the lights
I want to hold you tight
Let's stay here forever
At the dance

Music starts to play
Carries us away
Let's get together
At the dance

Feel your body move
Get into the groove
Let's stay here forever
At the dance

I've been watching you
You've been watching me
You're my dream come true
You're my fantasy
Will you be my girl?
Will you stay with me?

Let yourself go free
Come along with me
Let's get together
At the dance

Girl we'll be so fine
I'll be yours and you'll be mine

Barry Manilow,"So all alone
Little girl blue
You tell me the tale
And stand there crying

I'm here for you
You know that I care
Listening to you
Inside I'm dying

Your heart may be breaking
But my heart is breaking too

He doesn't care if you're all alone
But I do
He doesn't care if you come back home
But I do, yes I do
Why can't you feel it too

I'm your best friend
A brother you say
Hurting me so
To see your sorrow

Knew all along
He's not for you
Sadness and tears
But tomorrow

You'll see how I need you
And maybe you'll need me too

He doesn't care if he breaks your heart
But I do
He doesn't care if you fall apart
But I do

Oh, don't throw your love away
On someone who doesn't deserve it
If you belonged to me I'd love you more each day
I'd take you and make you believe what I say",He Doesn't Care (But I Do)
Barry Manilow,"Sometimes late at night
When the shadows made by street lamps
Cast a darkened silver light
You'll drift into my mind
Reminding me of all I've lost
And all I've yet to find

So many things I know I should have told you
Now what I wouldn't give if I could hold you

If you were here with me tonight
This time I'd never let it end
We'd find those feelings we once had
And feel them all again
We'd make love stronger than before
And give each other even more
And finally find a way to make it right
If you were here with me tonight
Here with me tonight

Somehow now I see
How time can soften
Even the most painful memory
Now what we had is gone
And the sooner I believe in that
The sooner I'll go on

But love like ours comes just once in a lifetime
So I tell myself it just wasn't the right time

If you were here with me tonight
This time I'd never let it end
We'd find those feelings we once had
And feel them all again
We'd make love stronger than before
And give each other even more
And finally find a way to make it right
If you were here with me tonight
Here with me tonight

Tonight the minutes seem like hours
How long before the light of day
Helps to chase these thoughts away",If You Were Here with Me Tonight
Barry Manilow,"There is somebody
In this world somebody
She was put on earth for me
Where can her love be?

See, I'm no exception
I need real affection
What's life worth living for
If not to give it all...so

I'm reaching out
I'm in search of love
You're everything that I'm dreamin' of
I can't give up, no!
I'm reaching out
I'm in search of love
Been on my own for long enough

Well, I'm goin' crazy
Only you can save me
>From the tears and loneliness
Girl, I must confess

That day or night time
There is no right time
For a heart to be alone
I just can't go on...so

I'm reaching out
I'm in search of love
You're everything that I'm dreamin' of
I can't give up, no!
I'm reaching out
I'm in search of love
Been on my own for long enough

Barry Manilow,"Once you find what matters in your life
Keep on pushing through the darkness
Till you see the light
You're gonna find it
You're no longer behind it

Once you learn what you've been doin' wrong
You can make the change
You need to make to carry on
Now and forever
The sooner the better, just remember now...

It's a long way up
When you're coming from nowhere
It's a long way up
When you're coming from nowhere
You gotta fight a little harder
You gotta push a little more
You gotta gamble everything you got
To get you through the door
Cause it's a long way up
You've been down before but that's okay
You can rest assured
That every dog will have his day
And life is a jungle
But you ain't gonna crumble, remember now...

That's when you'll make it",It's a Long Way Up
Barry Manilow,"I spent my whole life thinking
Oh, that there could not be
Anyone in this world
Who'd show me they care
Who'd really be there to love me

Now you're holding me
And I see in your eyes
That you've been lonely too baby

We've been all alone on our own for so long
But it's all behind us
The words no one heard when we sang our sad song
Well it's all behind us now

Every time I looked for love
It looked the other way
Now love has turned around
It's smiling at me
Now someone loves me
All the nights in the moonlight
With no one to hold me
Take a good look at us baby!

We've been all alone on our own for so long
But it's all behind us
The words no one heard when we sang our sad song
Well it's all behind us

Every dream is coming true
Now that I am holding you near
Happiness without an end
I feel alive again
Suddenly I can not even remember when

We were all alone on own for so long
But it's all behind us
The words no one heard when we sang our sad song
Well, it's all behind us now",It's All Behind Us Now
Barry Manilow,"All my life
I've been living in a fantasy
Songs of love
To help me through the night

All my life
I keep wondering where you'll be
When will I finally see the light

Oh, some sweet day
I know I'll find you
I won't stop searching til I do
This I swear
If I live my whole life through
I'll hold on till my dream comes true
Some sweet day
Some sweet day

Where are you
Darling, how I need you now
Need your voice
I need to know your name
Where are you
Please try to get through somehow
I don't want to be alone again

Oh, Some sweet day
I know I'll find you
I won't stop searching til I do
This I swear
If I live my whole life through
I'll hold on till my dream comes true

And I keep on asking why
If I have to hold out much longer
I will surely die",Some Sweet Day
Barry Manilow,"Midnight
Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan
Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can dream of the old days
Life was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
Every street lamp seems to beat
A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp sputters
Soon it will be morning

Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life and
I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin
Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale court smell of morning
A street lamp dies
Another night is over
Another day is dawning
Touch me
It is so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you'll touch me
You'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day has begun...",Memory
Barry Manilow,"Just one voice 
Singing in the darkness
All it takes is one voice
Singing so they hear what's on your mind
And when you look around you'll find 
There's more than

One voice
Singing in the darkness
Joining with your one voice
Each and every note another rock
And hands are joined and fears unlock

If only one voice
Would start it  on it's own
You need just one voice
Facing the unknown
And then that one voice
Would never be alone
It takes that one voice

Pa pa pa pa pa, pa pa pa pa 

It takes that one voice
Just one voice
Singing in the darkness
All it takes just one voice
Shout it out and let it ring
Just one voice
It takes that one voice
And everyone will sing",One Voice
Barry Manilow,"I've been tryin for hour just to think of what exactly to say
I thought I leave you with a letter or a fiery speech
Like when an actor makes an exit at the end of a play
And I've been dying for hours trying to fill up all the holes with some sense
I like to know why you gave up and threw it away
I like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant
Well, I can tell you goodbye or maybe see you around
With just a touch of sarcastic thanks
We started out with a bang
And at the top of the world
Now the guns are exhausted
And the bullets are blanks
And everything's blank

[Chorus:]
If I could only find the words
Then I would write it all down
If I could only find the voice
I would speak
Oh its there in my eyes
Oh can't you see me tonight
Come on and look at me
And read 'em and weep

[Chorus]

I've been whispering softly
Trying to build a cry up to a scream
We let the past slip away
And put the future on hold
Now the present is nothing but a hollowed out dream
And I've been dreaming forever
Hoping something would eventually come
I saw your eyes in the dark
I felt your kiss on my lips
I traced your body in the air
'Til the bodies were numb
Well, I could tell you goodbye
Or maybe see you around
With just a touch of a sarcastic thanks
But now the rooms are all empty
The candles are dark
The guns are exhausted
And the bullets are blank
And everything is blank

[Chorus]

Oh it's there in my eyes
And coming straight from my heart
It's running silent and angry and deep
Oh it's there in my eyes
And it's all I can say
Come on and look at me
And read 'em and weep",Read 'Em and Weep
Barry Manilow,"If ever you got rain in your heart,
Someone has hurt you, and torn you apart,
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?

And let it be like they said it would be -
Me loving you girl, and you loving me.
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?

Run to me whenever you're lonely. (to love me)
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Now and then, you need someone older,
So darling, you run to me.

And when you're out in the cold,
No one beside you, and no one to hold,
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?

And when you've got nothing to lose,
Nothing to pay for, nothing to choose,
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me

Run to me whenever you're lonely. (to love me)
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Now and then you need someone older,
So darling, you run to me.",Run to Me
Barry Manilow,"There must be lights burning brighter, somewhere
Got to be birds, flying higher in a sky more blue
If I can dream of a better land
Where all my brothers walk hand in hand
Tell me why, oh why, oh why can't my dream come true
Oh why

There will be peace, and understanding sometime
Strong winds of promise that will blow away
The doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun
Where hope is shining on everyone
Tell me why, oh why, oh why can't that sun appear

We're caught in a cloud, with too much rain
We're lost in a world, with too much pain
But as long as a man, has the strength to dream
He can redeem his soul and fly, and fly

Deep in my heart, there's a trembling question
But I am sure that the answer's gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark, there's a burning candle
And if I can think, if I can talk
If I can stand, if I can walk, if I can dream
I'll make my dream come true

Deep in my heart, there's a trembling question
But I am sure that the answer's gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark, there's a burning candle
And if I can think, if I can talk

When you remember me
If you remember me
I hope you see it's not the way
I want it to be
Oh I'd be with you now
But wherever you go
My love goes with you

Keep on smiling, keep on shining
Even though you know you want to cry
I tried to love you
Looking in my eyes
You saw promises and lies
Too many times

And if you blame me, try and realize
There are promises and lies too many times

Barry Manilow,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far

To lose it all

It doesn't even matter",Mandy/It's a Miracle

Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do, about you now

Backbeat, the word was on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I
Would like to say to you but I don't know how

Because maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all, you're my wonderwall

Barry Manilow,"See I flew in from the West Coast
Just the other day
Yes, I flew in from the West Coast
And we circled J.F.K.

The movie ended and I pulled up the shade
Looked out the window while the Muzak played

But in my head I'm singin'
Singin' the Brooklyn Blues, oh, yeah

When you're growin' up in Brooklyn
The Bridge is like a friend
Said when you're growin' up in Brooklyn
That Bridge is sure your friend

Because that river looks a hundred miles wide
When all your dreams are on the other side

And that can start you singin'
Singin' the Brooklyn Blues, oh, yeah

Now I've got myself some money
A mansion in Bel-aire
Yes, I've spent a lot of money
And I've been most everywhere

But still there's somethin' missin' I've got to find
A part of me I must have left behind

That makes a guy start feelin'
Feelin' those Brooklyn Blues, my my

I've sung love songs to a princess
More than once or twice
I've sung rock 'n' roll in Paris
Jazz in paradise

But there's a song of mine I couldn't have sung
A tune I started back when I was young

Now I've come home to finish
Finish my Brooklyn Blues, my Brooklyn Blues

Barry Manilow,"Love slips away, and we move on
Night becomes the dawn

Words tear us up just like a storm
Now love is gone, leaving us strangers

The morning sky fills with rain
Nothing feels the same

Time leaves me remembering dreams
And places we've been
And how it all changes

Once, when you were mine
We lived within a world all our own
Once, when you were mine
Once, there was a time

Love slips away, and we move on",Once When You Were Mine

As we lie by the firelight
Let me hold you
'Til you have to go away
Don't let it end
Let me pretend you'll stay

One more thrill
While we're still in our solitude
One more moment
I can touch you tenderly

Can this be real?
Doesn't it feel like a fantasy?

When the night moves on
I'm afraid you'll be gone
With no reason or rhyme
So if I borrow
A bit of tomorrow
Is that such a crime?

Why can't we make believe
That the evening has just begun
Close your eyes to the rising sun
And hold me one more time

When the night moves on
I'm afraid you'll be gone
With no reason or rhyme

Barry Manilow,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart

You wandered down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by

Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
Now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright you are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
Of paradise where roses grew

Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain

Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain",Stardust

Barry Manilow,"It's raining down sorrow and nothing but bad news
You know I've had it up to here living with these blues
But I won't let it get me down, it's not the only game in town
In my mind, I'm goin' to Swing Street

I'm a dreamer on a rough road
And I need to hear the music once again
When there's nothing but bad news, I've got a way to beat the blues
I close my eyes, and I go to Swing Street

We can dance there, there's a chance there
Of finding a little romance there
You don't know who you'll meet
When you're down on Swing Street

Lose your blues in a minute
Cop a groove and you're in it
I'm tellin' you once, I'm tellin' you twice
Better take my advice

If you're weepin' and you're wailin'
I've got a cure to fix exactly what is ailin,
Count to four and grab my hand say I'll meet you by the band
You and I, we're goin' to Swing Street

Give yourself to the rhythm
And every wrong is forgiven
You may even lose the bluest of blues
Get back on your feet

When your best friends turn to strangers
And one more workin' day don't seem worth all the changes
Just reach out and take my hand and I'll meet you by the band

Hide another tear in the corner of your eye
I don't understand
What kind of game is this we're playing

Dancin' in the dark, shadow's in the night
Slowly going wrong, trying to make it right
The silence is so loud
I can't hear the words we're saying

Anyone can do the heartbreak
Everybody knows the dance
Oh, it's so easy to do
You tear a dream in two to kill a true romance

Anyone can do the heartbreak
Anyone can make love end
It's gonna take a little pain
Some fire and some rain to bring it back again

I know you're afraid, baby, so am I
You think you're going to fall, all you want to do is fly
We're up against the wall
And love is the chance we're taking

So baby, look into my heart, tell me can't you see
I belong with you, you belong with me?
When I hold you in my arms
We can hear the music playing

Anyone can do the heartbreak
Everybody knows the dance
Oh, it's so easy to do
You tear a dream in two to kill a true romance

Anyone can do the heartbreak
Anyone can make love end
It's gonna take a little pain
Some fire and some rain to bring it back again

And it's one step forward and two steps back
Well, we keep on moving
But we're only losing ground
We've got to turn this love around

Anyone can do the heartbreak
Everybody knows the dance
Oh, it's so easy to do
You tear a dream in two to kill a true romance

Anyone can do the heartbreak
Anyone can make love end

I can here the city screams

In another world
I could walk away
Pretend there was nothing
I wouldn't need you anyway

In another world
But not in this world

But still my heart is outside, beating at the door again
No promises to make or keep
And though I'm free to go
I end up chasing sleep again
Drift away
Wonder if you think of me
Yesterday, is the place I'm going endlessly

And though I realize the truth
Is not idealized in you
Why should I be surprised to find
That you are always on my mind

But now we must make a choice 
Whether to fall in love. 

[Chorus]
Once and for all 
Do you really want to have someone for good? 
Would you stay in love forever if you could? 
Do you want a friend who's always standing by, 
When your back's against the wall, once and for all. 

We're a pair cut from the same cloth, 
Deep in our own souls, 
Alone and yet perfectly whole, 
But seemingly in control. 
Afraid not knowing just where we are, 
But knowing we've come so far, 
So far that we just might make it. 

Once and for all, search your heart 
And then I want you to decide. 
Is simple love enough to keep you by my side? 
Can we stay together through the thick and thin, 
Through troubles big and small, 
Once and for all?

Now you and I have lived out centuries,
And all I can say is what you've offered to me.

'Cause I've stood there too;
Between survival and the right thing to do.
'Cause only the strong admit their fears,
And if you really need me,
I'll always be here.

Fade to memories in the still of the night.
And you wonder in your mind,
If there's nothing left to show for all the time.

But someday someone will make you glad you survived.

You're nowhere in sight
And all that I wanted was
To be with you
Tonight
I've watched love get closer
And then fade away
I've seen you believe in me
I've seen you trying to stay
But what good is holding on
When you know
That all you can think about 
Is letting go
They say if you love someone
Then set them free
If they come back again
Then in the end
It was meant to be
I thought we were lovers
I thought we were friends
I guess when reality
Steps in
The dreaming ends
We live for the future
We learn from the past
No matter how hard we try
Some good things never last
All you can think about
Is letting go
Be true to yourself my love
That's all I ever wanted you to be
Just don't forget to smile
When you think of me
I'll reach for the stars
I have got them in sight
There's someone who really needs me

Yesterday fades away into the past

Is gone

Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win 
But you begin again 
Even though you're heart is breaking 
In time, the sun will shine 
And you'll begin again

Life's bittersweet mystery 
Never tells what will be 
You can create your own reality 
And make your dreams come true 
It's really up to you 
If you begin again 

Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win

I kept my world protected

When friends are hard to find
And life seems so unkind
Sometimes you feel afraid

Just aim beyond the clouds
And rise above the crowds
And start your own parade

'Cause when I chase my fears away
That's when I knew that I could finally say

Too see if reindeer even know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from 1 to 92
All though it's been said many times
Many ways
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you",The Christmas Song
Barry Manilow,"Now, I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Barry Manilow,"I've been walkin' these streets so long
Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'

We will kiss with our eyes
We will sleep without tears

For the song that we sing

We can heal all our wounds
We can use our own names
If we only have love

We can melt all the guns
And then give the new world
To our daughters and sons
If we only have love

Then Jerusalem's stands
And then death has no shadow
There are no foreign lands
If we only have love

We will never bow down
We'll be tall as the pines
Neither here or nor clowns
If we only have love

And we'll drink from the grail
To be born once again
Then with nothing at all

We'll have conquered all time

Barry Manilow,"There's a kid inside, 
And I have him with me always. 
There's a kid inside, 
Walking down old high school hallways. 
Where's a kid inside, 
At a desk, at a dance, in the halls,in the showers. 

There's a kid inside to this very day. 
And he makes a try for that high pop fly, 
That I fumbled one September. 
And he makes a fuss over some A plus, 
That I shouldn't still remember. 

And he goes along, 
Getting hurt, getting mad, fighting fights that are over. 
And unless I'm strong, 
All my senses are carried away. 

I can feel my hand, my trembling hand, 
On Michelle's angora sweater. 
I can hear my band, that awful band,
Only now it sounds much better. 

I can see the kid, the kid I use to be, 
On the stage, on the field, on the lunch line. 
I can feel him tugging at me, 
Every time I think I don't care I blink, 
And he's there, he's there again. 

Fighting ancient wrongs, 
Humming old hit songs in my head. 
Singing come along, come along, 
Come along for the ride. 

To a time and place, 
I could not forget if I tried. 
And I never know, when the breeze'll blow, 
With a rush of old sensation. 

Why the kid should wake, 
And my heart should ache, 
Every time I smell carnations.
Something rings the bell, 
Any thing at all, 
All it takes is a slam of a locker. 

Or the switch from summer or fall, 
A change of season seems barely reason, 
But there he goes, he's there again. 

Fighting ancient wrongs, 
Humming old hit songs in my head. 
Singing come along, come along, 
Come along for the ride. 

To a time and place, 
I could not for get if I tried. 
There he goes again, 
Hummin' his songs. 

He's there again, 
There's a kid inside
Hummin' his songs. 
He's there again, 
There's a kid inside.",The Kid Inside
Barry Manilow,"On the day I was born
Set me father said he
I've got an elegent legacy waiting for me
It's a rhyme for your lips
It's a song for your heart
To sing it whenever the world falls apart

Look, look , look to the rainbow
Follow it over the hills and stream
Look, look, look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow who follows our dream

It was a sumptuous gift
To beguile to a child
Or the lore of that song kept her feet running wild
For you never grow old
And you never stand still
With whipper will singing beyond the next hill

Look, look , look to the rainbow
Follow it over the hills and stream

Follow the fellow who follows a dream

Strike one me heart and I roam the world free
To the east with a lark
To the west with the sea
And I searched all the Earth
And I scanned all the sky
But I found it at last
In my own true love's eyes

Luck let a gentleman see
How nice a dame you can be
I know the other way you treated
Other guys you've been with
Luck be a lady with me

A lady doesn't leave her escort
It isn't fair, it isn't nice
A lady doesn't wander all over the room
And blow on some other guys dice

So let's keep the party polite
Never get out of my sight
Stick with me baby
I'm the fellow you came in with

A lady wouldn't flirt with strangers
She have a heart, she have a soul
A lady wouldn't make little snake eyes at me

No I never met one that I didn't like

Almost made me change my mind
Yet somehow I always find
If you don't expect too much
There's a certain human touch

Try the shoes on that are his
Feel what makes him what he is
What's it like inside his skin
Living in the skin he's in
Just like me a lump of sod

Barry Manilow,"We walked to the sea, just my father and me
And the dogs played around on the sand
Winter cold cut the air, hangin' still everywhere
Dressed in gray, did he say, ""Hold my hand""
I said, ""Love's easier when it's far away""
We sat and watched a distant light

We're two ships that pass in the night
We both smile and we say, ""It's alright""
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night

There's a boat on the line where the sea meets the sky
There's another that rides far behind
And it seems you and I are like strangers a wide ways apart
As we drift on through time
He said, ""It's harder now we're far away""
We only read you when you write

We're two ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night

We're just ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight

Lay me down roll me out to sea

Barry Manilow,"I remember all my life 
raining down as cold as ice. 
Shadows of a man, 
a face through a window cryin' in the night, 
the night goes into 

Morning just another day; 
happy people pass my way. 
Looking in their eyes, 
I see a memory I never realized 
how happy you made me. 

Oh Mandy well, 
you came and you gave without taking, 
but I sent you away. 
Oh, Mandy well, 
you kissed me and stopped me from shaking, 
and I need you today. Oh, Mandy! 

I'm standing on the edge of time; 
I walked away when love was mine. 
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing, 
the tears are on my mind 
and nothin' is rhyming. 

Oh Mandy well, 
you came and you gave without taking, 
but I sent you away. 
Oh, Mandy well, 
you kissed me and stopped me from shaking, 
and I need you today. Oh, Mandy!

Yesterday's a dream, I face the morning
cryin' on the breeze, the pain is callin'

Oh Mandy well, 
you came and you gave without taking, 
but I sent you away. 
Oh, Mandy well, 
you kissed me and stopped me from shaking, 
and I need you today

Oh Mandy,

Oh, Mandy, 
you kissed me and stopped me from shaking,

Barry Manilow,"Candles burning, glasses are chilled and soon she'll be by 
Hope and pray she'll say that she's willing to give us another try 
And if all those plans I made don't melt the lady's heart 
I'll put on the old 45's 

And maybe the old songs will bring back the old times 
Maybe the old lines will sound new 
Maybe she'll lay her head on my shoulder 
Maybe old feelings will come through 

Maybe we'll start to cry and wonder why we ever walked away 
Maybe the old songs will bring back the old times 
And make her want to stay 

It's been too long since I've seen her face light up when I come home 
It's been too many hours I've wasted staring at the phone 
Sweet old songs I'm counting on you to bring her back to me 
I'm tired of listening alone 

And maybe the old songs will bring back the old times 
Maybe the old lines will sound new 
Maybe she'll lay her head on my shoulder 
Maybe old feelings will come through 

Maybe we'll start to cry and wonder why we ever walked away 
Maybe the old songs will bring back the old times

Barry Manilow,"Just One Voice, 
Singing in the darkness, 
All it takes is One Voice, 
Singing so they hear what's on your mind, 
And when you look around you'll find 
There's more than 

One Voice, 
Singing in the darkness, 
Joining with your One Voice, 
Each and every note another octave, 
Hands are joined and fears unlocked, 
If only 

One Voice 
Would start it on its own, 
We need just One Voice facing the unknown, 
And then that One Voice would never be alone, 
It takes that One Voice. 

It takes that One Voice. 

Just One Voice

All it takes is One Voice, 
Shout it out and let it ring.

Barry Manilow,"She's a great little housewife
Though sometimes she talks like a fool
But she helps at the store in the holiday rush
And she picks up the kids after school
And she puts down the phone
When her husband comes home

And she changes from mother to wife
'Til she feels the words hanging between them
And she hangs by her words to her life

She says I swear I love my husband,
I love my kids
I wanted to be like my mother
But if I hadn't done it as soon as I did
Oh there might have been time to be me
For myself, for myself

There's so many things that she wishes
She don't even know what she's missin'
And that's how she knows that she missed

She's a sweetheart, except when she's moody
It's hard to get through to her then
Depressed for a while
When the youngest was born
Oh but that happens now and again

She might take a drink with the housework
Or when Michael's kept late at the shop
A Martini or two before dinner
But she always knows when to stop

She says I swear I love my husband
And I love my kids
You know I wanted to be like my mother

Now it's seldom if ever they go
Once you've paid for the sitter
And parkin' the car
There's no money left for the show

She was doing the dishes
When a glass fell and broke on the tile
And she cut her wrist (quite by mistake)
It was real touch and go for a while

She says Oh God I love my husband
And I love my kids
You know I wanted to be like my, my mother

Guess I always knew inside
I wouldn't have you for a long time

And if they're calling you away 
I have no right to make you stay

But somewhere down the road
Our roads are gonna cross again

But somewhere down the road

I still believe in us together
I understand more than you think I can
You have to go out on your own
So you can find your way back home

But somewhere down the road
Our roads are gonna cross again
It doesn't really matter when
But somewhere down the road
I know that heart of yours will come to see
That you belong with me

Maybe the best is yet to come

Down the pike
Never met a man I didn't like.

Royal Prince of Wales or working Joe
Though I know life's one long rocky hike
Never met a man I didn't like.

I've bumped into all kinds of people
Fancy cinema stars, false evangelists,
Politicians, morticians,
And I have reached the conclusion
While hiking the pike
Though I try and I try
Never once met a guy that I didn't like.

I said I've roamed along the Napa Valley
Shubert Alley, Rue De La Play,
Oklahoma and Kalamazoo, oh oh oh

Yes I'll say it till I'm done
No I never met one that I didn't like.

Almost made me change my mind

Try the shoes on that are his
Feel what makes him what he is
What's it like inside his skin

When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

Took me away
To long rocky beaches
And you by the bay
We started a story
Whose end must now wait

When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

I feel brave and daring
I feel my blood flow

Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina
 
When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin'

Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you

Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore
 
Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless why stir up memories?
 
Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for?
Awf'lly diff'rent without you

Barry Manilow,"Your green eyes with their soft lights,
Your eyes that promise sweet nights,
Bring to my soul a longing, a thirst for love devine.
In dreams I seem to hold you, to find you and enfold you,
Our lips meet and our hearts, too, with a thrill so sublime

Those cool and limpid green eyes -
A pool wherein my love lies.

So deep that in my searching for happiness
I fear that they will ever haunt me,
All through my life they'll taunt me
But will they ever want me?
Green eyes, make my dreams come true.

Green eyes with their soft lights
And eyes that promise sweet nights
Bring to my soul a longing, a thirst for love devine.

A pool where in my love lies
So deep that in my searching for happiness
I fear that they will ever haunt me,
All through my life they'll taunt me.
But will they ever want me?
Green eyes, I love you.

When you taught me how to say

And that happy tune is your step

That summer of '78
It seem we floated through the days
And nights were always filled with stars
And it seemed every song they played on the radio
Was ours

Only for lovers

And now when the winter's are long

Barry Manilow,"You make me feel so young 
You make me feel so spring has sprung 
And every time I see you grin 
I'm such a happy individual 
The moment that you speak 
I want to go and play hide-and-seek 
I want to go and bounce the moon 
Just like a toy balloon 
You and I, are just like a couple of tots 
Running across the meadow 
Picking up lots of forget-me-nots 
You make me feel so young 
You make me feel there are songs to be sung 
Bells to be rung, and a wonderful fling to be flung 
And even when I'm old and gray 
I'm gonna feel the way I do today 
'Cause you make me feel so young 
You and I, are just like a couple of tots 
Running across the meadow 
Picking up lots of forget-me-nots 
Cause you make me young 
Give me songs to be sung 
Fell like bells should be rung 
And a wonderful fling should be flung 
And even when I'm old and grey 
I'm gonna fell the way I do today 
Cause you make me feel so 
You make me feel so 
You make me feel 
I feel so young",You Make Me Feel So Young
Barry Manilow,"Got nobody left to listen to
Got no promises to keep
Something's gotta be out there
Fine a world for me out there
No more livin' half asleep

There's an island in the misty night
Little platform by the track
I dreamed I saw a light for me
A face, a place so right for me
That I'd never think of lookin' back

Through the shadowland
Like a silver band
Got no kind of plan
I ride the border train
Somewhere new to be
Light the way for me
Moon and memories
I ride the border train

City jumps up like a circus
Neon flutters out of sight
The town itself is traveling
America unraveling
And swallowed in the hungry night

Through the shadowland
Like a silver band
Got no kind of plan
I ride the border train
Somewhere new to be
Light the way for me
Moon and memories
I ride the border train

There'll come a time
With no goodbyes
When I'll simply grab
That border train
And at journey's end
They will all be real
My lovers and friends
And I swear to God
There's time for me
And I'll live the life I waited for!

Wooo oooo ooo oooo
Wooo oooo ooo oooo
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
I ride the border train

Somewhere new to be
Please light the way for me

Barry Manilow,"Freddie's got the dirt on
Everybody on the street
Don't know how he does it
But it isn't too discreet
Everybody says
It always winds up being true
He's got somethin' on everyone
Maybe even you!

Freddie know-oh yeah
Freddie goes-""oh yeah,
I got the 411 in my head!""
That's what freddie said

One night freddie's goin' home
He's had a long, long day
When he see big eddie
Runnin' out the alleyway
Freddie looks at the shadow
Of a body with a shrug
There's slapsie layin' deader
Then an ugly fire plug

Freddie know-oh yeah
Freddie goes-""oh yeah!""
I'll get the 411 to the feds!""
That's what freddie said

Personally I don't think that
Was such a wise move on freddie's part
If you see what I'm sayin'

Freddie now has the biggest news
He's ever had
But eddie knows that freddie knows
And man, you knows, that's's bad!
'Cause next night
Freddie's walking home
Just like he did before
Badda-boom! badda-bang!
Badda-bing!
He won't be blabbin' anymore!

See eddie said-""oh yeah!
Freddie's dead!-oh yeah
No more the 411 in his head
That's 'cause freddie's dead

Now you know the skinny
All about the scuttlebutt
And the moral of this story is
To keep your big mouth shutt!

'Cause freddie said-""oh yeah!""
Now freddie's dead!-oh yeah
I'll keep the 411 in my head!""

Barry Manilow,"I hear her playing music
In her room alone at night

She just moved in a month ago
She isn't gonna play the game
I thought she'd smile
And come on slow
I still don't even know her name
She must like being lonely
Got no time for anyone
But I hear her play that stereo
Right through to the rising sun

I hear her playing music
In her room alone at night
Through the day she's so elusive
Staying safe and out of sight
If you say hello she lets it go
Cool and so polite
And I hear her playing music
In her room alone at night

Baby are you sad and lonely
Or did somebody do you wrong
Cause you know that you need only
Look my way
And they'll play our song
And I love your nightly music
But you can't keep playing through
Cause I'm having trouble sleeping
And when I do I dream of you

I thought I'd try
And break the freeze
And win her heart with harmony
So I answered back
And played a stack
Of my favorite CD's
But she just doesn't hear me
Doesn't have a word to say
So I stay awake and turn it up
Hoping she'll look out my way

I hear her playing music
In her room alone at night
Through the day she's so elusive
Staying safe and out of sight
If you say hello she lets it go
Cool and so polite

Barry Manilow,"When I wake up everyday
I miss you
And it never goes away
I miss you
People smile and while
I take and even laugh
I'm not even half the man they knew
Without you
When I'm in our bed each night
And I turn out the light
Oh how I miss you

Little things reminding me about you
Who will I annoy again, if not you?
In my silent room sometimes
I'll close my eyes
And I whisper sweet good-byes
You'll never hear
Esther dear
Fifty years, Ester and Joe
Tell me how could this be so?
Oh how I miss you

Was I there
When you needed me to be there?
Could you see
There wasn't one day
When you weren't my best girl?
Though we both drove each other crazy
I love all the love you gave me
And you where all that mattered
In my world

Everyday I love you more
And miss you
And I wish you knew
That through the darkest night
You are still the light
That helps me find my way
And I pray

One day we will meet again
And all this emptiness will end
And I will kiss you

The crowd was hangin' in the neighborhood

Everyone was feelin' so good
Now, mister puente

Said he was comin' back to his roots again

My life forever changed
I felt my heart and soul come alive
I felt it all
Movin' and swayin' under the moon
Prayin' to the rhythm of a puente tune
The night that Tito played
Nothin' was ever the same

There was Romona
She came uptown from corona
Right there on the stairway of the subway train
We danced real slow
(She was heaven to know)
She whispered secrets
The way she kissed me it was perfect
We held on in the shadows of the city lights
Oh, it felt so right

I'll be right back
I just gotta talk
To a friend
For a couple of minutes

I see you looking
At the two of us
And what do you see
The oldest couple at the Mayflower
Esther and Me

I push her in the chair
I know she'd walk
If she could
She says ""Take your pills""
As if they do any good

I'll bet you think
That what you're looking
At is all we are
Two old people forgetting
The way we were
Sonny, no one is
What they look like

Sonny, no one is
What they look like
And we're not what
You see that's for sure

You should have known her before
You should have known her before
Legs she had legs
That made the guys drool
And her waist was as small
As your neck
And the face and the hair
And the rest of her
And when I look at her now
I still see her young and beautiful
She's my girl and I'm her Joe
And we're not what you see

In a minute baby I'll be right back
I just got some more to say
To my young new friend here

Esther just turned 80 and I'm 83
The oldest couple at the Mayflower
Esther and me
I knew that when I saw her
We were meant to be one
She says she didn't notice me
But don't you believe her

Loved to feel and a built
Watch out Joe Poluka
I could see I could hear
I could run a mile
And when I dream of us now
I still see us young and beautiful
She's my girl and I'm her Joe
And we're not what you see

I guess I better go now
She's my family
The oldest couple
At the Mayflower
Esther and Me
I'll help her with her bath
And then I'll kiss her goodnight
And sometime's we dance
In the early moonlight

You're looking at is all we are

By the harbor
I'll find you
There you'll be
As you where

By the jukebox

Gone a mile
Swayin' your head
To the crazy ragtime
Sayin' ""hey you got a quater?
Hey you look familiar
Hey you got a quater?
Let's dance to the ragtime""

Slow down
Don't time fly
Chased your smile
To some cold dingy attic
Now memories of
A room we shared
Heaven and home to me longer
And longer ago

I can remember

Time's up
Callin' ships all of the sounds
Of a restless harbor

Barry Manilow,"After it was over,
After the crying and
All the angry shouting
When we've both just given up
And you turned and closed the door
I didn't know what was wrong anymore
Than I did before

Maybe it was over
When you stopped trying
Or when I started doubting
Maybe you don't care enough
Maybe I'm just scared you'll go
But maybe what's really wrong is that
I still don't really know

Talk to me quietly, peacefully
Tell me what to do
Talk to me honestly, don't you see I need to talk to you

I need to hear that we're okay
And say the things I meant to say

So, talk to me before
Before it's really over

When it all was starting
When I first met you
We couldn't keep from talking

I knew everything you felt
And I felt you knew me too
Now I'm talking to myself
Or I'm just yelling back at you

How this could have happened
How I could loose you
Or you could think to leave me
After where we started from
I'm too dumb I guess to see
But you can't go till I do
Any you know you owe that to me

Talk to me quietly, peacefully
I don't want to fight
Talk to me nice and slow
So I'll know how to make it right

I'm not afraid to take the blame
I'm just afraid we'll stay the same
And we won't talk until
Until it's really over

I don't understand why you're always mad
What could I have done?
What could be so bad?
Don't you want to know why I never sleep?
Look what we've become from all these secrets
That we keep

When it's really over
'Cause I can't take it
Or you've walked out for the last time
When these years are just a dream
And those tears somehow have dried
I can't wake up in my bed
And regret what we never tried

So, please don't say it's over
Don't even think it
Just think about the good times
Think of all we've got to loose
And not who's done what to who
And when it comes time to choose
Think of who would still die for you

Talk to me quietly, peacefully
Make me understand
Say what you need to say
By the way-take me by the hand

The only thing I ask of you
Is please for once just listen to
And talk to me before
Before it's really over

Talk to me
Before it's really over",Talk to Me

I'd give up again
I'd remember when the days
Were stormy

And it feels like home

In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Like a child you whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel a power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Barry Manilow,"It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And signing songs of joy and peace
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on

But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green
I'm going to make a lot of money
Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I made my baby cry

Well she tried hard to help me
You know, she put me at ease
And she loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on

I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the best baby
That I ever had
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I made my baby say goodbye

Barry Manilow,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Barry Manilow,"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say ""Are you married?""
We'll say ""No man,
But you can do the job when you're in town""

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
Were walkin' in a winter wonderland
Yea, walkin' in a winter wonderland...",Winter Wonderland
Barry Manilow,"

Oh my love
You were the only one
Now you're gone and I'm alone
All my friends
They say what's done is done
I pretend
But deep inside I know

If I should love again
If I find someone new
It would be make-believe
For in my heart
It would be you
And though I hold her close
And want her now and then
I'll still be loving you
If I should love again

All day long
I keep remembering
All the night
I think of you
All my life
You'll be the song I sing
I'll get by
But this I swear is true

If I should love again
If I find someone new
It would be make-believe
For in my heart
It would be you
And though I hold her close
And want her now and then
I'll still be loving you
If I should love again

",If I Should Love Again [Live]
Barry Manilow,"Candles burning, glasses are chilled and soon she'll be by 
Hope and pray she'll say that she's willing to give us another try 
And if all those plans I made don't melt the lady's heart 
I'll put on the old 45's 

And maybe the old songs will bring back the old times 
Maybe the old lines will sound new 
Maybe she'll lay her head on my shoulder 
Maybe old feelings will come through 

Maybe we'll start to cry and wonder why we ever walked away 
Maybe the old songs will bring back the old times 
And make her want to stay 

It's been too long since I've seen her face light up when I come home 
It's been too many hours I've wasted staring at the phone 
Sweet old songs I'm counting on you to bring her back to me 
I'm tired of listening alone 

And maybe the old songs will bring back the old times 
Maybe the old lines will sound new 
Maybe she'll lay her head on my shoulder 
Maybe old feelings will come through 

Maybe we'll start to cry and wonder why we ever walked away 
Maybe the old songs will bring back the old times

Barry Manilow,"FOREVER AND A DAY

They said we'd never last
A week, a month, a year
They shook their head
Dream on, they said, 'cause dreamers disappear
But here we are, no matter what they say
It's you and me forever and a day

We knew we had it right
We knew we broke the mold
They said have fun, it's kiss and run
Then back out in the cold
I could have told them
We were here to stay
To you and me forever and a day

Didn't we show them
Aren't they blown away
'Cause what ever time may do
Our love is through, forever

And once our hearts were full
And once we felt the flame
Such hunger then, much younger then
But really we're the same

And once the music played
And once they lit the light
And years ago, we felt a glow
So very like tonight

And now I know
It will always be that way
For you, for me,
Forever and a day



",Forever and a Day
Barry Manilow,"Harmony
Unforgettable harmony
Harmony
First there was harmony
And there was rhyme
This was our time

Harmony
Did we have harmony
And that's just about all we had!
Suddenly
A little harmony
And the poverty's not so bad
Thin, we were
Poor as sin in berlin, we were!
Patches on our pants
Mercif'lly, when you're in harmony
You're in a trance
Others went marching
Not us, we'd dance

No one in grodnogubernia
Ever learned to dance like this!

Spoken:
(Believe it or not I was a rabbi before all this started!
In grodnogubernia yet!)

If you're in grodnogubernia
Tell em', this you shouldn't miss!

Harmony
All arm in arm were we
Well, except when the punches flew
Squabbles, sure
But squabbles don't endure
When there's harmony in the brew
Then did we
Oh, so splendidly blend, did we
Like a spell had come
It was clear
My pals and I could hear
A different drum
Outside they hollered!
But we hadâ?¦harmony!

In this joint
All encounters with counterpoint
End in harmony
And it's clear
No man's a solo here
Not even me
No solo mio!

No we've got harmony!
When we've got harmony
Then just maybe we've got a chance
Harmony, the best is harmony!
And the rest is a song and dance!

Where you find
You're in harmony
There you find
Shelter in a storm
Every note
A button on the coat
That keeps you warm
Stars have the heavens
But we've got harmony!
Harmony!
Harmony!
Harmony!
Troubles disappear
And what you feel is what you hear
Not what you see!
Yes, first there was
Harmony!

Night after night I can see the life
She's stumbing through
And I know that she'll never notice me
But I still look for a sign

'cause she should'a been mine
She could'a been mine
We would'a been sharing love until the end of
Time
I should'a known how
We would'a been close to paradise by now
If it could'a been
It would'a been
Still she should'a been mine

sometimes she smiles when I see her passing by
Sometime she waves
When she turns and whispers ""hi"", again
And I see the pain of the life she lives
Yet I'm hoping for a sign

'cause she should'a been mine
She could'a been mine
We would'a been sharing love until the end of
Time
I should'a known how
We would'a been close to paradise by now

And you´re changin' the way 
That you're wearin' your hair 
And I wonder yes I wonder 
Something's on my mind 
The letters you get, cigarettes that I find 
And you know that I'd have to be deaf, 
Dumb and blind

And the milkman he smiles 
when he's shakin' my hand

Barry Manilow,"Every day
As I sit and stare through my window
I look out
At a world that's tearing apart
This is what I see
And what do you see?

Time goes by
And the times get worse
Through my window
Still I watch
As the madness darkens the heart
This is what I see.
And what do you see?

Tell me how do we live in a world
That is crumbling away--
And be happy
As we are today?

Still I watch
As I pin my hopes on the future
Still I wait
Wond'ring what in heaven will be--
Is this an ending
Or a beginning
That I see?
And what do you see?

And at times it appears that our happiness
Hangs by a thread
Can we hold on
Through what lies ahead?

People say
I should turn away
From the window
All the worry
In all the world doesn't pay
And still I wonder
What kind of future
Starts this way?
For you...
And me....
And what do you see?



",And What Do You See?
Barry Manilow,"There are times
You live as if in a dream
Drawn by your heart to a distant door
One that opens
For a moment
To a world that you've never known before
Were you real
Or were you part of a dream
Calling to me from across the floor?
In your sweet voice
There was music
And we danced the Bolero de Amor
Let the drums carry us away!
They say all there is to say
And all too soon the night becomes the day
And magical, miracle
You are real
And we are living a dream
Sharing a love we have hungered for
Let your passion soar like music
In the spell of Bolero de Amor
The drums carried us away
They said all there was to say
And all too soon the night became day
And magical-miracle

Drawn by your heart to a distant door

How in the world?
Now that I've found you

This peculiar world we live in

That's lost all its reason
At last there's a reason
For hope in my heart
In this world
Unsure of its future
So sure of you
I say, let the future start!
In this world
That's yearning for someone
To answer the call
From out of the blue
In this world
I prayed there would come one
Magnificent someone
Someone like you

Look at the stars
How brilliant they are
How can they be shining now
When hope seems so far?

Look
Look how they shine
These cruelest of stars
What promise inspires them?
What faith is it fires them?

Darkness grows
The world turns cold
And still there glows the light
Heaven knows
What hope they hold tonight

Look
Look how they tease
These stars in the night
The darker the night becomes
The brighter their light becomes

Chill winds wail
The tempest brews
And clouds assail the sky
Through the veil
The stars refuse to die!

In this world
Of darkest night
Where hope is hurled away
There they are
And still there's light
Oh so far
But will they...?
Dare they lift our hearts
As we lift our eyes
Are we fools to see
The hope that's gleaming in the skies?
Look!
There's the light!

Barry Manilow,"When my heart is torn apart 
by love I wish I had, 
Well, I spend my nights in the city's lights 
and things don't seem so bad. 
Ya know the movement seems to soothe me, 
and the temp takes control, 
and I lose my blues 
when the Ne w York City rhythm fill my soul; 
it's the New York City rhythm runnin' thru' my life, 
the pounding beat of the city streets 
that keeps mydreams alive. 
I'm lost, I'm found, I'm up, I'm down, 
but somehow I survive. 
It's got to be the New Y ork City rhythm in my life, 
It's got to be the New York City rhythm in my life, 
in my life. 
When I'm out for love or sin, 
Oh, it's good to be in town, 
In the funky dives on the old west sid 
there's always somethin' goin' down. 
Oh yes , I live my life with strangers, 
and the danger's always there, 
but when I hit Broadway and it's time to play, 
ya know that I don't care; 
It's the New York City rhythm runnin' thru my life, 
the poundin' beat of the city streets 
that kee ps my dreams alive. 
I'm lost, I'm found, I'm up, I'm down, , 
but somehow I survive. 
It's got to be the New York City rhythm in my life,

Barry Manilow,"Time can never mend
The careless whispers
Of a good friend
To the heart and mind,
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort
In the truth
Pain is all you'll find

Should've known better

I feel so unsure
As I take your hand
And lead you
To the dance floor
As the music dies,
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind
The silver screen
And all it's sad good-byes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

[Chorus]
Should've known better
Than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance
That I've been given
So I'm never
Gonna dance again
The way
I danced with you

Time can never mend
The careless whispers
Of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort
In the truth
Pain is all
You'll find

I'm never
Gonna dance again
Guilty feet have
Got no rhythm
Though
It's easy to pretend
I know
You're not a fool

[Chorus]

Never without your love

Tonight
The music seems so loud
I wish
That we could lose
This crowd
Maybe
It's better this way
We'd hurt each other
With the things
We'd want to say

We could have been
So good together
We could have lived
This dance forever
But no one's
Gonna dance with me
Please stay

And I'm never
Gonna dance again
Guilty feet have
Got no rhythm
Though it's easy
To pretend
I know
You're not a fool

The day you caught my eye.
I hope that we two will never say ""Good-bye.""

I hope you really believe me baby 'cause I certainly do.
'Cause you're thrillin' me, you're really,

Really thrilling when you tell me that you probably got a kind of crush on me,
That moves me, grooves me.
How divine can one woman be?
Well little darlin',

You got me fallin'.
You got me goofy and gay.
I'm gonna get carried away.
Just think, you're gonna be mine someday.

Park a little, stop a little,
Spark a little,
Live a little,
Love a little,

Nobody loves me like you, dear.

Try a little, sigh a little,

Barry Manilow,"Fairy tales can come true, it can happen to you
If you're young at heart
For it's hard you will find to be narrow of mind

And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or on its way

To be young at heart?
For as rich as you are, it's much better by far

Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon-dust
In your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around

When you're on the street,
When evening falls so hard

And pain is all around,

With many a winding turn
That leads us to who knows where

Strong enough to carry him

His welfare is of my concern
No burden is he to bear
We'll get there
For I know
He would not encumber me
He ain't heavy, he's my brother

If I'm laden at all
I'm laden with sadness
That everyone's heart
Isn't filled with the gladness
Of love for one another

From which there is no return
While we're on the way to there

Was everything a man could wanna do

How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again

And misty memories of days gone by

Caught up in a world of uphill climbing

Well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you 
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you 
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Be mine tonight
Let this be just the start of so many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow and then seal it with a kiss

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you 
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you 
Now that I have found you
Don't ever go 

Don't ever go 
Cause I love you so",The Look of Love
Barry Manilow,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",Love Is Here to Stay
Barry Manilow,"I knew the time had to come
When I'd be held under your thumb
I'm like a pawn in your hand
Moved and compelled, at your command
Whether it's for bad or for good
I would never change it if I could

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you
So if I laugh or I cry
I made my bed, that's where I'll lie
For what happens there's no excuse
I put my own head in the noose",Nevertheless
Barry Manilow,"Where do I begin? 
To tell the story of how greater love can be
The sweet love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me
Where do I start?

With her first hello
She gave a meaning to this empty world of mine
They'll never be another love, another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart

She fills my heart
With very special things
With angel songs
With wild imaginings
She fills my soul
With so much love

That anywhere I go
I'm never lonely
With her alone 
Who could be lonely
I reach for her hand
It's always there

How long does it last?
Can love be measured 
By the hours of the day?
I have no answer now
But this much I can say
I know I need her 
Till the stars all burn away
And she'll be there","Where Do I Begin? [Theme from ""Love Story""]"
Barry Manilow,"Just like a leaf
That keeps blowing in the wind
And where it happens to fall
No one at all can plan
Just like I kicked around
Until you showed me
Where I belong
That's when my song began

How can I thank you for the love
You've given me
With all my heart I hope
You'll see what I see
I've got the best seat in the house
I've got the most beautiful view
You can't imagine how it feels
Just sitting here looking at you
I've got the best seat in the house

Night after night
I look at you
And try to be the best I can be
Knowing you'll see me through
I swear I'll never take your love for granted
I'd never trade the dreams that you made come true
It's sweet to know
We're growing closer
Every year
With all my heart I hope
You'll keep this place here

I've got the best seat in the house
I've got the most beautiful view
You can't imagine how it feels
Just sitting here looking at you
That's what I love to do
I've got the best seat in the house
I'll tell you I got the most beautiful view
You can't imagine how it feels
Just sitting here looking at you
I've got the best seat in the house
I've got the best seat in the house",The Best Seat in the House
Barry Manilow,"Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation

We can ride it together, 
Making love with each other 

Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha

I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing when you got no one
And you walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that wont happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever

We can ride it together,
Making love with each other,

Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, 
From one lover to another",Islands in the Stream

Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We're no strangers to love
You know the rules, and so do I
A full commitments what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how Im feeling
Gotta make you understand

[Chorus]

We've know each other for so long
Your heart's been aching
But you're too shy to say it

And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

Knowing what I got inside of me
Working a job
That any poor slob could fill

Out of some fairground
Over the hill

And spinning above the clouds
Here I am just a nobody
Longing for hot light
Lost in the crowd

Don't let me be an untold story

Riding the world like a rocket
Painting the sky
For all of those eyes below

Couldn't you clock it
Wouldn't I go?

Lose yesterday's blues
When you're ready for morning
Have I got news

It's no longer on hold

Dream baby, dream

I had mountains to climb 
And a promise to keep
Now home is the hunter 
And holding the prize
I'm waiting to tell you 
When you open your eyes

Bring on tomorrow for me and for you
We hung on through dark hours, dawn's overdue
Bring on tomorrow and show me the sun
We'll live it together 'cause you are the one

But you'll really be smiling 
By morning's light

They promised I'd lose
Forgive and forget them

Barry Manilow,"It really doesn't matter if he suffered all he claims
You know he started somewhere and he found his way to fame
And feeding on the lonely crowd, he finally belongs
A power by the microphone, he sings his troubled songs

He's a star
No one can tell him anymore
He'll ride as far
As the road can go
And what it costs, he oughta know
He said she'd do it
He's a star, oh oh whoa

They're hangin' on his music as it fills the concert hall
And he's teasin' them with moments, when you think he'll give it all
But he's holdin' back the total, 'cause that's how he works the spell
Yeah, he likes to leave 'em hungry, yeah he loves to hear them yell

'Cause he's a star

And finally, the wild applause that cleans his soul and saves
He's left with no companions, only enemies and slaves
He's scared again the show was slow, he felt it fall behind
Tomorrow night's already raising riot in his mind

But he's a star no one can tell him anymore

Barry Manilow,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far

I had to fall
To lose it all

Of a warm summer morning
A symphony born in the sun

And followed your climb

Most beautiful one

Is quiet and darkened
The crowd is 
Covered in smiles

But you sure kept 
'Em waiting awhile

And danced in your light

Isn't it strange how
Dreams fade and shimmer?
Walking on foreign ground,
Like a shadow,
Roaming in far off
Territory.
Over your shoulder,
Stories unfold, you're
Searching for sanctuary.
Y know you're
I see a picture
By the lamp's flicker.
Isn't it strange how
Dreams fade and shimmer?
Walking on foreign ground,
Like a shadow,
Roaming in far off
Territory.
Over your shoulder,
Stories unfold, you're
Searching for sanctuary.
You know you're

Never going to get to France.
Never going to....
Never going to get to France.
Never going to....
Never going to get to France.
Never going to....

Barry Ryan,"Under a temperamental sun
On the dark hillside of your sorrow
If there's pain in your heart
Let it go
Just reach inside and let it go
Now dig
To know someone deeply
Is to know someone softly
To know someone deeply
Is to know someone softly
Listen to me know
In my love garden
I wrestled with an angel
Not in a dream
Her eyes did seem
Like the grapes of the vine
Her lips were made like the gates of Heaven
Not to be missed
Made to be kissed
But not to kiss goodbye
The larger picture
Will come with time
But for tonight, dear
Let's lullabye
To know someone deeply
Is to know someone softly
To know someone deeply
Is to know someone softly
Listen to me know
Once a flower opens
It never closes
Until it dies
And the it lies
Amongst the roses
I wanted to play her like
A black grand piano
A clarinet
A minuet
Or lyric soprano
In my arms there's
A safety zone
Where nothing can harm you
Your heart or home
To know someone deeply
Is to know someone softly
To know someone deeply
Is to know someone softly
Sing
Dum Dum Dum Dum Sha La La
Da Da Dum Sha La La La La
To know someone deeply
Is to know someone softly
To know someone deeply
Is to know someone softly

Barry Stramp,"I painted a picture, of a day gone past
An ancient scripture, a house of glass
People looking through the window
Never knowing what they'd find
When they couldn't see me
I locked the door, left them behind
The sky will tell me, I'm not the only one
And the sky will tell me, I must believe the sun

I shut my eyes, to not go blind
Things I can't see, I see in my mind
Oh now the passing clouds of rain
Have surely passed us by
Poor is the man
That believes his own lie

And the sky will tell me
I'm not the only one

I must believe the sun

Barry Tuckwell,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I","Bewitched, Bothered And Bewildered"

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Barry Tuckwell,"Some day, when I'm awfully low,
When the world is cold,
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight.

Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.

Lovely, never, ever change.
Keep that breathless charm.
Won't you please arrange it?
Cause I love you 
Just the way you look tonight.

Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed

That's where the two will go,

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel

Oh, girl, I swear I've got to talk to you
There's something that I feel we need to do
Let's take the time to try to figure out
What's happened to us, baby, what's it all about

We're getting further from each other every day
We can't just sit by and watch love walk away
If we don't try to save the love we got
Once we lose it, girl, we're gonna lose a lot

It never changed a thing between the two of us
We always found a way to face it all together
We need each other now, darling, more than ever

We've got to find the love we used to know
Oh, if we find that love we'll learn to let it go
Oh, what a shame if we lose all that

I miss my baby's arms
His tender finger tips
Knows just how to keep me warm

It may be zero degrees
With the snow falling down
But I've got warm and tender love
Just as long as he's around

It may be winter outside
But in my heart it's spring
How much joy and pleasure, baby
Can one guy bring me

Winter nights can be awful cold
Without someone to hold
But when I have him next to me
Baby, I'm in ecstasy

[Chorus]

Throughout my life
I've had my share of guys
But he's been the only one
Who can make my temperature rise

Things are just not the same
When he's not by my side
But yet, I shouldn't complain
But be waiting with my arms open wide

[Chorus: x3]",It May Be Winter Outside (But in My Heart It's Spring)
