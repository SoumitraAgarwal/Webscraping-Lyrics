Tech N9ne,"Had a shindig everybody in mi casa
When I was approached by a lady trying to blend me proper
When she asked if I really was the king of the choppers
Bitch, I'm Mufasa

Let me know if you rolling
Let me know if you down
'Cause I see you choosing
You know I hold it down
Even though I came a long way from the blocks
Still wave my finger to the cops
I see you like what I got
So let me know if you rolling
Let me know if you down
I see you choosing

Aye
With this bimbo, hit this indo
Said she wanna give me hella vicious dingo
'Bout to make the music crescendo
So don't nobody hear me knock it out with the quickness Kimbo
So I had to get the bitch's info
The top was mental, lovely ladies suck it, stay silento
Resemble monkey wrench though
I don't need your credentials
We men though
Leave you in light and leave you in limbo
She chose
N9ne I'm impossible to figure and decode
She wanna really welcome me to the freak show
She fuck with the homies, Sav Siccness and Bleezo
She said that both of my homies they gave her the heave ho
But she never had me killin' it befo'
So I gave her the meat and it was more than Rodigo
She coming to every blur party we throw
(Tim Tebow)
Fakers be oozing illusions
They said they banging, but they moving and grooving
That's why the ladies want the dude with the fusion
Of indica oil and Keith who'd'n and coolin'
Stuffed and puffed like a Cuban
You trippin', she left with us
You get bruised and contusions
Used and abused and fooled
'Cause Tecca N9na, she choosin'

Let me know if you rolling
Let me know if you down
'Cause I see you choosing
You know I hold it down
Even though I came a long way from the blocks
Still wave my finger to the cops
I see you like what I got
So let me know if you rolling
Let me know if you down
I see you choosing

Aye
Choosin' me because I make her nod
Wanna eat my dick up like a brat
Ya niggas hope that Tecca N9na rot
They never close enough to get a shot
'Cause I be chilling way up at the top
But we never too comfortable and thinking it won't pop
You can bet that the heaters on my family stay cocked
And my governors ready for the petty who said he hot
'Cause I beat, beat, beat, beat, beat her
With the d and not D Jeter
Then I found out she a queef skeeter
When I mixed OJ with the Beef-eater
Your girly's punani it was a deep greeter
Coming at me you'll be a hit by the peace bleeder
I'm a beast I beat beep and she's cheater
She want me in her mouth, I will at least feed her
You know the rules of the game
Your bitch just chose me
We can handle this like we got some class or
Get into the gangster shit if you tripping low-key
Women is never nothing to steal
When you making hella bread and you go from here to Brazil
So you gotta know I'm the nigga that she wanna get to for big thrills for real

Let me know if you rolling
Let me know if you down
'Cause I see you choosing
You know I hold it down
Even though I came a long way from the blocks
Still wave my finger to the cops
I see you like what I got
So let me know if you rolling
Let me know if you down
I see you choosing",Choosin
Tech N9ne,"Blah, blah, blah, bitch
Using bid'ness just to sit up on my dick
How I know is cause she asking for my Addie, Addie
When we at work, she hopin' that we both be chatty patties
Yeah?

Fuh what?
They want your number so they can call you
Fuh what?
Just to come over to cook for all you
Fuh what?
Thought she was thirsty and it was all true
Only business she want is hopin' you let her fall through
Fuh what?
They want your number so they can call you

Just to come over to cook for all you
Fuh what?
Thought she was thirsty and it was all true
Only business she want is hopin' you let her fall through
Fuh what?

Givin' y'all the shout of the day
We celebrating, we no longer selling powder for pay
Though the ladies really wanna question without a delay
They beat around the bush instead of gettin' it out of the way
Come to my success, we yelling ""Prost"" (Prost!)
I can never blame the bitches wanting to get close
'Cause this independent game, we make the most
That's why all the ladies asking me ""Can we get ghost?""
(Ghost!)
Then these ladies wanna fuck down
But they want us all to hush now
Instead of saying she wants her guts pounded, she think of everything to cut 'round it
I'ma just tell you to cut to the chase
You want the D, and you up for the taste
Lie and run away, got lots of people
They rushing for our way like fucking seagulls
Wanna see you after hours, to cut
But instead of steppin', like a coward, you stuck
Wanna come and make me chowder? drink some Amaretto Sours?
Play that Absolute Power louder to fu-fu

Fuh what?
They want your number so they can call you
Fuh what?
Just to come over to cook for all you

Only business she want is hopin' you let her fall through
Fuh what?

I ain't with that phony shit
Stop acting like we got bid'ness when you wanted to only sit on thee dick
See me and passin' you, wanna see you wag your tail
Worse that can happen is me telling you ""Take this bag of L's""
Hate you had to fail, 'cause really it was on groom-watch
Havin' visions of you when I was livin' up in the Boondocks
Bringin' children up in the building, try'na consume shots
Blood-sucking bitches be the reason I keep my room locked
So keep a square bid'ness
The thing you really want from Tech Nina ain't near bid'ness
They really quick to run up and offer you their digits
They got millionaire wishes
They want you to bare witness, to share kisses

Fuh what?
They want your number so they can call you
Fuh what?
Just to come over to cook for all you

Only business she want is hopin' you let her fall through

Ringin' my phone
Real late at night when my bitch is at home
I can't believe it, this got me heated
How you gon' hit me this late 'bout a song

Bitch, watch your lip quick
Let us be realistic
If you come in fraudulent, you'll never sit on this dick
She look at my Rollie
Barely even know me, wanna cook me some Bertolli
Question is fuh what?
Answer is to fuck!

Keep it real baby bubble
Burning bridges bein' a bish washer
Tech N9ne!
And she's on call, fuh what?
They want your number so they can call you
Just to come over to cook for all you
Thought she was thirsty and it was all true
Only business she want is hopin' you let her fall through",Fuh What?
Tech N9ne,"(Tech Nina, let's get it)
Mama told me get it and I did
Make a beautiful livin' for my kids
Man, I'm really in love with my gig
Wasn't always known I couldn't take the throne 
Until I raced for home and I slid
For my labels flown where I lived
But the Yates was growin' in my biz
And I couldn't even afford Reebok's
It was Payless shoes and holy socks
Then I started to earn G-knots
Screamin' F-T-I on TV spots
Livin' the lovely life we chose
Still I'm livin' it by street codes
Pain and poverty put these flows in Beast Mode
Here we go

The road to my success from here was not a block away
On the coast they told me I'ma part with Travis, not today
We just wanted what's hot to play
But they gave me no slot to slay
Even though I'm not Lecrae, every day Tecca Nina would drop to pray
On my knees in a cot
There was multiple beds in my spot
So let the champagne pop
Everybody feelin' my gang, gang lots
Took a lot of hard work to get guap
When you comin' from a scarred turf, could be stopped
From the hurtful dirt to the top
Yeah we gonna celebrate today cause we got

Let the song play (we got it)
'Cause we done came a long way (we got it)
They know we get that grown pay (we got it)
Now they mess with me the long way (we got it)

They know we get that grown pay (we got it)
Now they mess with me the long way (we got it)
The long way

Too big and too ugly, would you ever love me?
Every city we visit, we get it, but people they look at us funny
I feel like I'm way too fat, but what I'm packin' is making them kitties get after 'em
They hearing me flippin' and rip the back up out the track, then they trackin' a pack of 'em
Applause, applause, now we sell it enough to get our house and our cars up
Gotta get them bars up to be part of the upper echelon and hit the stars up
And we did it (okay)
Me and Nina stay committed to our art, we always doin' our part
We get it (okay)
And we knew we gettin' the cheese or we siezin' our G's up, Jesus
Only breaking from making 'em rock
The pushin' manuever been making the block
Indusin', I'm cool when I'm oozin'
I'm cruisin' the planet, they think I'm faking a lot
I gotta get to the money, gotta get to the money, and they think I'm making a lot
I'm keepin' a millimeter pilly under the tummy for dummies, if they wanna plot
New money, I ain't trying to save
'Cause I just made it
Look at my royalty state
Thank God for the ones who gave it
Lots of props for the ones who made it (okay)
'Cause this road ain't paved
Sippin' till I'm elevated
We made it, so we gon'

Let the song play (we got it)

They know we get that grown pay (we got it)
Now they mess with me the long way (we got it)

They know we get that grown pay (we got it)
Now they mess with me the long way (we got it)
The long way

Yeah, we started this Strange Music in Trav's basement
Now we gonna have our fifth Strange building because we had patience
And I got all these mass payments with a mad cadence
Kill it when I rip it up, I'm makin' 'em listen, not pickin' me up, and I never have a cash craving
We appreciate this, so we create hits
See me lay this, inebriated
And we be faded, indeed we stay lit
From the oddest, to people listen, and look at me Godish
Not a time for Nina to be modest
People celebrate with me 'cause we got it

Let the song play (we got it)

Tech N9ne,"It's too many wanna be loved
I just wanna kcuf and get up
Don't gotta tell me what you're thinkin'
'Cause I know just what you're thinkin'
She light to me with a sign up
She just wanna get mind kcuffed

Hey
New pic through, my twit view
Had me wishin' I was next to you to sniff you
So the fact I never met you was an issue
It's true so I'm hopin' it's a get to
You baby what I am creating hope it lifts you
To where you never need a tissue
Just a wet towel when I see it's somethin' I wanna lick boo
Like your eyelids
Lot of beautiful parts of your body baby this is my bid
Have you trippin' about the freaky shit I did
You're interacting with the poet and porn hybrid
Lickin' things on your body
That they prolly, never thought of servicin' but romancin's my hobby
I'll lick you like a lolly, from your eyes and I'll leave
Your teeth in my sweet with my tongue like it was Molly
Hella beauty wake the N9ne up
When you share pretty pictures of your fine butt
Had a dream I bit your neck and red wine gushed
So I sipped you every time I eat the prime cut
Wanna take you to a spot, no one'll find us
Be secluded, we gettin' zooted, we design lust
You submissive with mental misses and I'm what?
Super dominant, get your ankles, wrist and mind kcuffed

Con-trol, something's wrong with me
I just can't let, go
Let me, let me see how far that you'll go
I got control of yo body
Now let me kcuf your mind
Let me kcuf your mind
Mind kcuf!

I tongue the inside of my mouth all day
So, by the time I get to you it'll be all play
Dancin' my tongue around where your pink drawers lay
We freaks but you creep's y'all wanna peek y'all pay
Yeah-e-yeah
A little bit of crazy there
She will be my lady if she don't look away, she will see my shady stare
Trying to hold your brain hostage
So you listen to every single thing I talk miss
Like let me hit it from the back in a crowded mosh pit
People peepin' what we doin', think we lost it
Hope you thinkin' what I'm sayin' isn't awkwid
And you ain't trippin' off of me 'cause you a boss bitch
I wanna take a dip in all your sauces
Don't be cautious, I wanna eat you 'til I'm nauseas
Can I suck your tongue? (Let me do it)
Can I touch your buns, when you push your gun in a lustful sprung (ooh)
With a thrust so hung, I'mma crush yo lungs (Yeah!)
You still readin'
I'm hoping for a response this evening, I'm teethin'
I'm hopin' your picture is not deceivin' 'cause jeez 
When I look at your body girl you're not even a vegan
Please direct message me
We try at best and then we die in ecstasy
I request that you mesh with me
See why it catches me, she fly as heck to me
I'm the kind that really wants to control your brain
Wanna lock you up in chains
Give you this pain when you feel every fuckin' thing

Con-trol, something's wrong with me

Tech N9ne,"Yeah, you must be throw'd
You gon' make them thangs come up out that load
You ain't built like that but you talk so cold
Yeah, we know

Hurts now, purps found 'cause a nigga squirt rounds
Acting like ya wore a purse on turf grounds
Like how his homies didn't tell him to pull his skirt down
Now look at'cha
Loud mouth we found a round to match ya
Bound to smack ya, now the ground'll catch ya
'Cause you frowned at the hounds and you found disaster
He talking hella shady
How I get it on the daily
They jelly bout my gravy but they crazy 'cause they think I won't be banging like the 80s
Your homie was a movie
So we dot him with the tooly
Got his family sick and woozy giving him the finger where Rodney O and Joe Cooley
They hot around the collar
'Cause I got a lot of shotters
So don't nobody bother, if they try to then we stoppin' they medulla oblongata
So be careful when you saucing
You could end up in the coffin
You better take precaution when you see real niggas crossing, shut the fuck up when we talking
If you get my killers heated
You'll be curled up like a fetus
All them words, you're gonna eat it
Every fist and all the feet is never ceasing when you pleaded
So I think you better comma
Or get lit up with the llama
KC all the way to Ghana, when you grown and start the drama, ain't no running to yo mama, nigga

No running to yo mama
When you caught up in the drama
No running to yo mama when you caught up in the drama 'cause you did nobody honor

No running to yo mama
When you caught up in the drama
No running to yo mama when you caught up in the drama 'cause you did nobody honor

We the boss players
In this, industry and not SEGA
Nigga we are stop haters
We take 'em to the end and then it's biva las begas
If you tripping, y'all nuts
'Cause we sick and all bust
So get the motherfucking pineapple, the rum and the coconut and mix it all up
We coming from the ghetto
And we keep the heavy metal
So you suckers better settle cause we turn a wolf and devil to a woman in stilettos
'Cause they didn't really want it
They was only in the moment
Hella talking, never on it
Had they're chance and now they blown it cause the king was their opponent
He bit the hand that fed him
Run you over if you let him
All the homies wanna get him, heard the words when he said them now I know that he regret them
'Cause we be getting money
And he be looking bummy
So keep the coward from me, when you see me don't be chummy
Muh'fucking dummy
I know you can't stand me
But you know that we go hammy
Have you sleeping like a xanny, hit them with a super whammy when I cut them from the family
We in every nook and cranny
Hit you when you're in your jammies, when you're in your manny panties
See me and my brother Sammy, ain't no yelling for your granny and no running to your mammy nigga

No running to yo mama

Tech N9ne,"I made a mistake
Now you can choose to stay and live with that mistake
Or you can beat me over the head with it over and over
'Till I'm gone

Beat it 'till it's broke and closed
'Till I'm gone, til I'm gone
This heart is just a fallen rose
So I'm gone, so I'm gone
You know you're my highlight

Break me, I'll be all right
Know that I'll be all right
You know you're my highlight
Fell into the limelight
Break me, I'll be all right
Know that I'll be all right

If you're blinded by the limelight that shines bright
On this individual's residuals fond slitch
Your mind might rip up the mess to design fights
To cry heif, destined to plummet in hindsight
If you feel you in my shadow and females'll get you rattled
With every tale they tattle, you raise hell in battle
Let us jail and hassle when the Queendom fails the castle
She unveils the shackles trying to bail is natural
You still here but complaints they stick
'Cause my life is too complicated and ain't basic
So the saint may split
Stay after that hiccup, you can't play vict
No you can't say sh

You chose to ride on this carousel
Anything petty, I para sail over
You stay where there is hell
I'm drowning in Ceroquel
Embarrassed this resembles marriage under a terror spell
Running free even though the cerebel isn't parallel
I do something you think is shady and you stay
Says you agree with us moving forward and we like okay
But a year later that means you can't take us back to that day
If so, better watch what you say 'cause it'll have us in disarray
Aye, so beat it 'till it's broke and closed
Break me down it won't be smooth like lotioned bows
Chosen souls meet the love potion flows
But when the oceans froze that's when we get ghost and rogue
Baby

Beat it 'till it's broke and closed
'Till I'm gone, 'till I'm gone
This heart is just a fallen rose
So I'm gone, so I'm gone

I keep my family by my side
I sleep with one eye open

I'm for real when I say I got an army
Stand down if you think you can harm me
Think about the war you'll be starting
Come for my people, you'll be sorry
'Cause we're not sorry, we're not sorry
So think about the war that you'll be starting
'Cause we're not sorry, we're not sorry

So called Christians, what do they do?
They label me evil, man you don't know just how crazy these people
So many conspiracies they get from hearing me
Fearing me 'cause they think that I'm the tyranny of Devilry
Think they planning to level me
'Cause I'm king of the revelry
I will never be taken by the hands of another man
I get grim like no other can
Christian household my mother ran, in this gutter land
Then she married a good Muslim brother man
So I had a hell of a lot of teaching
We leave sin on the table with the goodness and feasting
Eating like cannibals we're the animals beasting
Seeking the enemy who invented these preachings

If you come for me and my family, I'ma spray this clip
And my army is super ready if you haters trip
Keep popping off at the mouth, you get inflated lips
Ain't no Illuminati, don't let the ruckus consume ya body
I'ma groom the shotty then I'ma aim it at whom is naughty
With them damning me to hell, planning for me to fail
Ain't no landing me in cells, abandoning me in jail
Stop mocking me and my symbols
Back in the day was bishop, more, and me in the temple
So if you coming at me I will never be gentle
You gotta know ya conspiracy theories are mental
Me and my children breathing that is really essential
So me just being a rapper is not my only potential
Was brought up in a war, you can check my credentials
All I gotta do is tell my army come and let the sin flow
They see tenfold

Make hella doe like blow but it
Must be that vodka that's making me hot as fuck

Look at me I'm sweating like I hit a sherm stick
Fishnet, hairnet to cover my perm bitch
That's how I feel right now, I ain't concerned with the germs
Here to kill right now
I come to terms with the loss of my swisher right when I passed it to a bad bitch
Maybe she'll let me take home that ass, hit and casket it
Functional drunk and I masted it, fast with it
Asking if this chick wanna dip and dap and let me smash it a bit
Talkin' bout wet? Gave her the woop wap she shoutin' out ""Tech""
Nina bout to see the proper thing that brought the cream
I'm bout the jeans and I'm bout the zing zing leaders spot
And flee to the block and I free her like a stream
Whole team keep it's hot grits
I do not spit shit if it is not lit
So much liquor mixing in here I might be toxic
Sweating like fire, and bombing fluids where I drop sticks

In this thang dripping like I'm on we-we-wet
Whole body on my face full of swe-swe-sweat
On my level everybody try'na ge-ge-get
I don't get that stress when I rep that set

Spillin' Bom booze on shoes

Grab a brizzy, then get busy, Kansas Cizzy in Missizi

Question
Anybody ever feel
That some people around you claim to be solid but ain't real?
In relationships, business, family, in the end it's about they bills
And everyone of them wanna cheat and steal
Time for me to have no chill
Come and get ya meals and they really will with zeal
All is needy, y'all is greedy
I'm falling freely
This gonna be scogging me, we brawling easy
Had a lawman seize me
Get the hell on stay
What ya gonna do but if it's a fail on pay
Loved ones exude hella rude when it used to be smooth
Like the face of Janelle Monae
She's got the glee stopped
I'm in a pit of animals really making me bleed lots
Fatigue I wanna leave then my knee dropped
When I breathe not cause she needs guap
So extract me from this place full of hate that'll tax me
Pass the sack 'cause I'm trying to get to happy
Exactly people are feeding they call me nasty at me

Sometimes I just wanna fly away
Sometimes I just wanna leave the sky

Listen
They don't love you no more
They discover your flow
But I'm feeling my fans trying to shudder don't slow
Leaving the clown now I'm nothing but a bozo to 'em
Give my all in my sessions
I never thought that I would fall in regression
The music business now we call it recession
We bawl and we stressing 'cause y'all is divesting
I feel it when I ought to be top of these
Where the hip hopper be and The Rock put me
At the forefront but galore won, nothing but the Pac could be hypocrisy
They forgot about the prophecy that I keep the lock and key
But they talking ""He soft"" and flee now they wanna coffin me
Y'all can be treacherous, I'm the best at this effortless
But with Tech it's been deficits
Wanna fly away like a Pegasus
I feel like the scare is near, they don't care that Tech share his tears
At this moment, at this point in time I'd rather be anywhere but here

I'd rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here
I'd rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here

Sometimes I just wanna fly away
Sometimes I just wanna leave the sky

I'd rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here
I'd rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here

Sometimes I just wanna fly away
Sometimes I just wanna leave the sky

I'm sure to be
At this rate, a nigga that fades into obscurity
I can't take being treated like an amateur
This is impure to me
In closing, it's messed up when you know you one of the chosen
But you can't have a show when nobody rose and all the people go when everything's frozen

Flippin' the fire for the family focused and free-e
Listen to me-e doing it for T.V-e
With the rebel yell, came out of my shell
Preacher said tell your people let go of your coat-tail
With a tremendous fail he never to say my livin' is hell
But even worse said I lead my people to Hell's Bells
Lookin' at me just like my mother and father would breed creatures
Not an evil bone in my body and never known to be naughty in my seeds either
Simple and plain like a cheese pizza
I don't know prayin' on my knees keep us from heat seekers
Lovin' the bleed feature while the people tell me that I need Jesus!

Talk about, judgement
Speakin' to me with the people I'm leadin' em underway
And you read me and see me easy to be shunned away
But you got it all wrong
You seem to tell me I need Jesus! (oh, Jesus! Jesus!)
Every day they wanna condemn me
None of 'em even know me
Anyone ever that sinned cast the stone out
I'm stoned, let's talk about it

I'm askin'
What's happening?
Boy, 'cause they bashing me
Bangin' the Bible, butcher boy don't bother with blasphemy
Call em a crazy critic comin' causin' catastrophes
Aimin' at Aaron a lot of ammo and an angel actually
Ah mane, Amen
You people let the steeples speak in evil and the neezle playing God hymn
My mother was a Christian but I used to go with the wicked for the stick and whats the problem
Questioning the K.O.D.'s grim, anybody talkin hella crazy I'm 'bout to jaw them
You'll be up on a cross whenever you step to me so take precautions
Y'all false actors, callin' me a demon when I talk backwards siht pot
Tecca Nina gonna be sought after this drop by the people that go toss rappers hip hop
So you thinking you religious?
When you condemn another man you never lead us
Telling me whats under me is gonna heat us
Never believe ya cause really you need Jesus
Leave us

Talk about, judgement
Speakin' to me with the people I'm leadin' em underway
And you read me see me easy to be shunned away
But you got it all wrong
Let's talk about it

Mama never really talked about God
All that I was ever taught was I'm odd
Heard he knew 'bout every thought that I hide
Dirty mind I'd see a cross and I'd hide
Lost without God, salty 'bout that
But I was captivated by the bosses outside
I plotted every way to getting draws by my squad
Ask round why every man goes bad
Happens to pass down like second hand clothes man
Salvage a blouse gown and manicured toes had
Half of us ground bound for hell and Lord knows
Need a savior they say slain for your behavior
Raised in three days grace be what he gave ya
The sun that'll make ya want to gravitate ta
Pain temperate son, 'cause sins you didn't pay for
Bow to a name insane fast they told her
Vows to a dame, the tame Casanova
Wild, didn't change and came crash imposer
Doused in the flames and bank chapter closure
Spiritually drained, crashed and vulgar
Needed somewhere to go until rain passes over
Seeking a miracle from a stained-glass Jehovah
But I don't know if the ordained pastor's sober
Dang in disdain, prayed in vain
Care to sling dough, explain, do anything
Lay hands, borough plain, you entertained
Dealt pain, process ain't growing the brains
Confusing, now my fangs out, protruding
Rebuking, from mouth full of Communion
Scorned by lukewarm kind it's time you've been
Warned the storm formed now find refusing",Need Jesus
Tech N9ne,"I once said in a cypher of famous friends back in 2011
""Who do I catch?""
Outside of technicians' tunneled Tech vision
At a point in time when dope is the new whack
So it's safe to say we're in Bonnie says Cheadle
On the outskirts of our army, we scare people
But it's not for evil, up with hawks and eagles
But I'm lost and feeble wondering if this restarts the needle
Look around, do you spot Tech
In front of seventy thousand at RockFest
By the way he won the crowd does he got next
To infect the mainstream or sell a lot less
God bless my core fans still around
We're here 'cause you held us down
Love the way that you love my sounds
But I'm still try'na break new ground

Feels like I could blow out a fire with one breath
Look at the sky in the sun set
Sing a new song to change the mood
And move mountains with my hands
But just don't understand
Why this needle just won't move

Yes doing this for, yes doing this for, yes doing this for profit
And my pocket's one dimension
I wanna reach so many hearts and souls is my intention
Since 2001 is when I started my ascension
But in 2015 I went up just to get honorable mention
Makes me wanna end it, I get so offended
When they speak of genre breaking but no N9ne is ended
Or friended I'm winded, my music's intrinsic
But it's kinda looking like the needle ain't moving even when I did a killer with Kendrick
Jimmy Kimmel was splendid, formally an attendant
But when we were done it's like not one of them were mended
Maybe it's my image and large amount of grimness
My pen spits on them scripts
Thinking I'm on a sin trip and then skit
Rock on the range we had 'em flocking for Strange
But it was a shocker when no rockers remained
When it came to the game where they claimed
Fame could get you big as the Beatles
Yeah we got it this far but I really wanna push that needle

I could blow out a fire with one breath
Look at the sky in the sun set
Sing you a song to change the mood
And move mountains with my hands
But just don't understand
Why this needle just won't move

Pardon me Lucas
I was blessed to do a song with Marshall Mathers
I was thinking when the emcees hear this they hearts'll shatter
'Cause the art's so radder than babblers with partial chatter
But the garble swagger actors win it all, but this?
Not a chart no latter, dark so daggered
Why do nigga artists do this with me?
Man it make me feel so good when they all really do skip the fee
Slipknot, System Of A Down, Deftones, Doors got a few hits with T
But the one thing that makes me wanna say screw this and flee
Man I did it all this when music is free

I could blow out a fire with one breath
Look at the sky in the sun set
Sing you a song to change the mood
And move mountains with my hands
But just don't understand
Why this needle just won't move

Now they gonna say ""poor N9ne, please you're fine
'Cause you made it to the Forbes List 'bout at least four times""
But since I wrote my first rhyme it's been war time
To get the masses to see this talent deserves more shine
So this year I sat at my very first Grammys
Me and my partner Travis watching my peers go hammy
I thought about all the awards these folks should hand me
Man I swear I'd disappear if it wasn't for fans and family",The Needle

I'm the righteous
But I'm killing 'em like I'm Cypress
Play me like I'm not the nicest
No weefee, leave you lifeless
Taking a knife to fight with ISIS, I like it
When they spite they get vices
When they hit that pipe think they're psychic
Wanna get in my mic and try to slice it
But they do fizzle when they hear SuWu whistles
Disrespect me true this will happen and they lose signal
This was long awaited
Strange is how all the fakes were created

Spit shine on the track call me Armor All
And walk off with a life size Barbie doll, I'm like damn

Baby got back (L.A. fits with the Oakland booty)

I like 'em round, and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I want to get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talkin' bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I want to get with ya
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I want to fuck
Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies (yeah) Ladies (yeah)
If you want to role in my Mercedes (yeah)
Then turn around, stick it out
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back

Baby got back
Yeah, baby, when it comes to females
Cosmo ain't got nothin' 
To do with my selection 
Thirty six-twenty four- thirty six  
Ha ha, only if she's 5'3

So your girlfriend rolls a Honda, playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none 
Unless you've got buns, hon
You can do side bends or sit-ups 
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers want to play that hard role 
And tell you that the butt ain't gol'
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines
You ain't it, Miss Thing
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to dis
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round,
And you want a triple X throw down
Dial 1-900-MIXALOT
And kick them nasty thoughts

Who me?  A tease?  Brother, please
You're just having bad memories
About some skeeze who did the squeeze
And had you on your hands and knees
Look, I am telling you straight out
That's not what I'm all about
I'd just be playing myself out
If I spent the night at your house
Now don't get me wrong
I didn't mean to turn you on
We haven't known each other long

You showed me many of things  plenty of hard times 
Then I got up on it but the hard way 
Out there to tax  you chose me to slay 
I saw what you did  uh huh  and said nothin' 
But watched  clocked  then I kept bluffin' 
And schemed to capture the skill of your rapture 
Master become the massa and kick at ya 
A plan  a new stand for this woman 
Made to be deadly just like the omen 
No more trippin', too strong to fall 
Shoe's on the other foot, shots are mine to call 
Little did you know what you were showing 
It hurted when you flirted, but I kept going 
Now the student is the teacher, you can't freak her 
Play the game of life, and I'll beat ya 

You showed me what to do, exactly what to do 
When I was in love with you 
Oh, it's true, I can do it, too 
You showed me what to say, exactly what to say

Oh, it's true, games were made for two

Got three, four, and five fly bitches 
You dummy, you're so funny, leave me in stitches

Now I relieve the scratch when he itches 
I'm not the man, but I wear the britches 
So pitch your love and lies in the ditches 
P.S. hugs and kisses

And I decided it wasn't hard at all

In that very special way 
Oh, it's true, games were made for two 
You taught it to me too, exactly what to do 
And now I do it well

I tried it then I decided it's fun 
To catch the wave and ride it 
On from what you spawn 
Yo, I play like a rose, but I live like a thorn 
But anyhow, I do know now the tricks of the trade 
I ain't never gettin' played 
Say what you will, and do what you must 
It all fell apart when you betrayed my trust 
Don't worry, babe, you're still my main dish 
First on the menu but of a long list 
This ain't me, it's what you made me 
Now I'm slappin' you back with the same crap you gave me 
So get a grip, I'm hipper than hip 
And I'm sick and tired of your shit 
Let's make this clear, dear, I swear 
Never will I get dogged again, I'm outta here

See the danger,
Always danger,
Endless talking,
Life rebuilding,

Walk in silence,
Don't turn away, in silence.

My illusion,
Worn like a mask of self-hate,
Confronts and then dies.

Hunting by the rivers,
Through the streets,
Every corner abandoned too soon,
Set down with due care.

För att binda sköra trådar
Tvinna trådar
Till en tross
Mellan oss
Så vi når varandra

I den hårda tidens brus
Finns de skrik som ingen hör
Allt försvinner I ett sus

Till kristaller på min kind
Jag har ropat allt jag orkat
Allt jag orkat efter dig
Hör du mig
Kan vi nå varandra

I den långa vinterns spår
Trampas frusna blommor ner
Och där ensamheten går
Biter kylan alltid mer
Ändå har jag aldrig tvekat
Mellan mörker eller ljus
För när månens skära bleknat
Har allt pekat åt ditt håll
Och från mitt håll
Kan vi nå varandra

So don´t cry now behind your door
Asking the stars what we´re living for
I will show you
How you

Get to the shelter of peace
Where our minds are at ease
And believe me love is The Reason we´re here
Smile now wipe off your tears
It´s only human to show your fears
So don´t hide now your innocence
Lean on my shoulder with confidence
I´ll console you
Hold you

´til all your agony´s gone
And I´m sure that you´re strong 
So believe me love is The Reason we´re here

Empty skies are everywhere
Life will be so lonely there
In the silent Milky Way

Where the trees can´t grow
And children can´t play
Tell me who´s gonna stay
You say there is a better place
Than this earth we walk and the sky we face
Must be more than the atmosphere
Tell me why we´re stranded here
On this planet close to Mars
Where the shining stars
Decide who we are

Hear me I wish to say
Sometimes our needs are a touch away
So don´t fear me I´ve also cried
I know how it feels to be pushed aside
You must trust me

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

And they'd play his gay Hawaiian chant
Soon the other little natives started singin' it
And the hula hula maidens started swingin' it
Like a tropical storm that's the way it hit
Funny little gay Hawaiian Chant

You will hear this gay Hawaiian Chant",Hawaiian War Chant

Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

She'd be unhappy without me I know

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name

Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky

Where two hearts become one

Loving one who loves you

I'd like to add his initial to my monogram

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

That ain't no ghost - it's a reflection of you
Why do you turn away keep it out of sight

Or don't live up to your given role
There's more inside you that you won't show

But you keep it hidden just like everyone
You're scared to show her make you vulnerable
So you wear that ghost around you for a disguise

But there's no need just 'cause it's all we've known
There's more inside you that you haven't shown

So you keep on moving moving moving your feet
Keep in shuf- shuf- shuffling to this ghost dance beat
Just keep on walking down never ending streams

One day you'll walk right out of this life
And then you'll wonder why you didn't try

To spread some loving all around
Old fashioned causes like that still stand
Gotta rid this prejudice it brings you down

How do you feel at the end of the day
Just like you've walked over your own grave

So why are you frightened can't you see that it's you
At the moment there's nothing - so there's nothing to lose
Lift up your lonely heart and walk right on through",Ghosts
Ted Leo,"When I was a young boy
I wanted to sail around the world
That's the life for me, living on the sea
Spirit of a sailor, circumnavigates the globe

The lust of a pioneer, will acknowledge
No frontier
I remember you by, thunderclap in the sky
Lightning flash, tempers flare

'Round the horn if you dare

Lucky just to keep afloat

Glisten like a pearl
At the bottom of the world

Didn't stop the cavalier
So why should it stop me
I'll conquer and stay free
Ah c'mon all you lads

Let's forget and forgive
There's a world to explore
Tales to tell back on shore

Ted Leo,"Oh, lonely day, oh, led astray, oh, burden on the land
Oh always same, oh, nothing changed, oh, urge to bite the hand
Withholding on your promise to the air
Will only lead to something bad, I swear
You can't escape the Angels' Share.

Down again it seems a losing fight
Yet, down again, I sit, to try to write
An open letter to a President
Or melodies to help a girl pay rent
(We saved and saved, only to find them spent).

When oh, the long road leads me to your door
Feed me food and heal my health and offer me your floor
There, you'll find me lying there in the morn. 
If I don't wake, you've got to let me go on.
Let me go on my way.
Do try.
Get by.
Because on and on, the tides are going to come
As sure enough, they'll leave again as one
As you and I, we will or won't be here

Ted Leo,"I had a golden ring, and I kept it with golden things
In the Bank of a Million Dreams that was bursting at all the seams
I had a gold ring. It was such an important thing
That I kept it beneath my bed, and I carried it in my head
I had a golden dream, and the way it down came to me
Was through Captains of Alchemy, who came up from a steely sea
And I dreamed through the rainy night, and I managed to sleep alright
And my body became so light, that I managed to give it flight
Because I know gold is just a trick of light
And lead is light as a feather
So, leave me where the kids are alright
And we will all go down together
I had a golden dream, and they took it away from me
And they pulled it out of my head, and they showed me that it was lead",Better Dead Than Lead
Ted Leo,"Innocence, it don't come easy - in a sense it never will
Accidents mean no one's guilty; ignorance means someone's killed
So I asked our Mr. Mellor how to get to where one's going
And he points to his survival, and he points me down the road
As I go on
Wondering if I've got a soul and
Counting down the hours 'til it goes
On a dark wet night in April, on a street in Jersey where
I went looking for some writing that I knew would not be there
And a punter from the Pelhams and the police, in the rain
Were concerned more with a car than with the fact the light had changed
But after listening all morning, as I drove down 95
To a story of detainees who were barely kept alive
I could deal with trying to process pigeons acting like they're doves

But not with interference from the power lines above
As I go on
Wondering if I've got a soul and
Counting down the hours 'til it goes
And oh, precautions, yes precautions
But if you're playing with a gun, you could kill someone
And in the dark it's hard to know a friend
But I'm not angry, I won't be forever angry
As I'm walking toward tomorrow with a rifle in my hand
And I'm thinking about New England, and I'm missing old Japan
And a mountain in California where a spring runs hot and cold
And if I told you I felt ageless, would you tell me I'm not old?

Ted Leo,"Well Little Dawn walks on,
And she thinks she don't belong under the starry heights
So take a sigh as long as the war's been going on in your heart tonight
And if you want to make that light, go on and swim across the ocean
And if you want to make it right, go on and put your plan in motion
The gap is only as wide as the hollow of the sky between you, my dear
And the truth, absolute,
Adding naught more profound to it than that you are here
And if you want to keep it bright, well you might have to burn a candle
And if you want to keep it tight, well you might have to learn to handle
But on the days and nights you try to breathe
And you can't believe you still walk the streets
Stretch out your weary hand to me - it's alright
And if you're not content to just believe
And if you don't consent to just let it be
Stretch out your legs and dance with me all night, tonight 
It's alright",Little Dawn
Ted Leo,"As I was walking through a life one morning
The sun was out, the air was warm but oh,
I was cold, 
And though I must have looked a half a person,
To tell the tale in my own version,
It was only then that I felt whole.

Do you believe in something beautiful?
Then, get up and be it
Fighting for the smallest goal: 
To get a little self-control.
I know how hard you try. 
I see it in your eyes.
Call your friends, 'cause we've forgotten
What it's like to eat what's rotten,
And what's eating you alive, 
Might help you to survive.

We went on, as we were on a mission, 
Latest in a Grand Tradition. 
Oh, what did we find? 
It was Ego who was flying the banner,
Me and Mia, Ann and Ana, oh,
We'd been unkind.

Do you believe in something beautiful?
Then, get up and be it
Fighting for the smallest goal: 
To get a little self-control.
I see it in your eyes, 
I see it in your spine, 
But call your friends, 'cause we've forgotten
What it's like to eat what's rotten
And what's eating you alive, 
Might help you to survive

Even the nights that could get better.
And even the days aren't all that bad.
And after a week of fighting,
As more and more it seems the right thing 

Do you believe in something beautiful?
Then get up and be it
Fighting for the smallest goal: 
To gain a little self-control
Won't anybody here just let you disappear?
Not doctors, nor your mom nor dad,
But me and Mia, Ann and Ana
Know how hard you try, 
Don't you see it in my eyes?

Sick to death of my dependence,
Fighting food to find transcendence.
Fighting to survive.
More dead, but more alive.
Cigarettes and speed to live,
And sleeping pills to feel forgiven.
All that you contrive, 
And all that you're deprived.

All the bourgeois social angels
Telling you you've got to change.
Don't have any idea. 
They'll never see so clear.
But don't forget what it really means to
Hunger strike, 
When you don't really need to
Some are dying for the cause, but that don't make it yours.
And even the nights, they could get better",Me and Mia
Ted Leo,"I said, ""I wonder how it is I'm standing here, while war is raging everywhere under the sky?
I feel defeated here by everything, cheated here by everyone on every side.
I want to take you to a quiet place, and never ask the meaninglessness to reply.
When will we get an hour to celebrate, find the time to breathe a sigh?

I've been working too hard to be living, and later
Walking all night, until I'm shivering, and is it
Wasting the time that I've been given, to maybe
Wait for the day of oblivion?

I want to take it to the president, him and all the cabinet, with a broom.
I want to sweep the Halls of Arrogance, sweep the walls of the excrement of these baboons.
But I respect and prize the covenant -- I respect the process, I respect the rules.
When will we find a chord as resonant as to shake the sheets and make us move?

You've been working too hard to be living, and later
Walking all night, until you're shivering, and is it
Wasting the time that you've been given, to maybe
Wait for the day of oblivion?""

And she said, ""Roll out and make your mark. Pull on your boots and march.
Then roll on and meet me where you'll find me doing my own part.
Roll out your dented car. Maybe it won't roll far.
But if you do everything you can, well babe, that's more than a start.

Roll out and make your mark. Pull on your boots and march.
Then roll on and meet me where you'll find me good and ready.
Sometimes it's gonna hurt. Sometimes you're gonna deserve it.
But if you hold on to what you've got, I know you'll keep it steady.

So there's no end to work, so there's no end to the murk.
So everything else is dirt, but I am pure and steady.
So cut out the morbid verse. I know you'll make it work.
And how're you gonna save the world, when the world ain't ready?""",Shake the Sheets

Never an evergreen
Floating above the scene
As still as a figurine

Expressionless, so serene
But I know what makes you scream
So don't you run out of steam
I know you, Colleen

It's been all messed up since the very beginning
You act so tough, people think that you're winning
Everyone wants something from Colleen

Colleen, perpetually between
What is and what could have been
Floating through your routine
Every day since you were fifteen

And as rosy as you make it seem
I know life for you ain't been a dream
To have to deal with the things you've seen
While they work you like your

Machines break down, but you can't break with them
It's too late now, so don't break the rhythm
Everyone wants something from Colleen

Colleen, if ever you walk into
A dead-end street, come clean
Don't say that it's all, all in your mind
Because I know what you mean, Colleen

Hey, it's been all messed up since the very beginning
It's too late now, 'cause we're already in it
Everyone wants something from Colleen
And no one gets 'cause she's no one's Colleen, Colleen

Ted Leo,"Well, the day dawned and dried the grass on the ground
Someone up and died without a sound
And though we looked for you, well, you couldn't be found
You were already on your way, dear

But tall through it all, you'd admit no defeat
Despite the grief that you get from everyone you meet
But open up and let things change, dear
Now we don't ask for medals, we don't ask for praise
We work hard instead, and then we walk away
But when the question still pends at the end of every day
Oh, open up to what it's saying
So the weight of the world, it won't get you down
You make what you wear and you don't wait around
You give ‘em what they want (or as much as you can)
Like you've done all along, and you'll do again
But who do you love? Who do you love? Who do you love?
So the weight of your will will stave off decline
And you won't stop that war, but that don't stop you trying
You say all the words that move all our friends
And you work ‘til the clock has gone ‘round again
But who do you love? Who do you love? Who do you love?
And so goes the most of our freedom of speech: we live for the city, we work for the beach

Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,

She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;

They wanted all the buffalo dead. 

Everything was SO sad. 

When I looked above the canyon wall, 
Some strong eyes did I see. 
I think its somebody comin' around 
To save my ass,baby. 

I think...I think he's comin' around 
To save you and me. 

Boys...... 

I said, above the canyon wall... 
Strong eyes did glow. 
It was the leader of the land,baby. 
OH MY GOD, 

The GREAT WHITE BUFFALO..... 
LOOK OUT!!!! LOOK OUT!!!!!!! 

Well,he got the battered herd. 
He led em cross the land. 
With the Great White Buffalo, 
They gonna make a final stand. 

The Great White Buffalo, 
Comin'around to make a final stand. 
Well,look out here he comes. 
The great white buffalo,baby. 
The Great White Buffalo.... 
Look out,here he comes. 
He's doin'all right. 
Makin'everything all right.

Ted Nugent,"Did you know
Could you see
Don't you feel

You should have told me
I was there 
When you needed

But you lied
Now you're gone
And I'm alone

I get scared
Feel the pain
My hearts bleeding

Ch:
I can't believe all the loneliness
I was lost when you left our home
It was strange to exist with the loneliness
I'm not used to being alone

They were sure 
I was strong 
I could take it

They don't see
All the nights
That I cry

Ch:
I can't believe all the loneliness
I was lost when you left our home
It was strange to exist with the loneliness
I'm not used to being alone

Maybe now 
I can find
A new baby

Maybe now
I can start
Over again

No more tears
No more pain
And no lying

Its so hard
Its ok
Now I'm trying

Ch:
I can't believe all the loneliness
I was lost when you left our home
It was strange to exist with the loneliness
I'm not used to being alone

Not used to being alone
Not used to being alone
Not used to being alone
Not used to being alone
Not used to being alone
Not used to being alone
Not used to being alone
Not used to being alone
Not used to being alone
Not used to being alone
Not used to being alone

Ted Nugent,"I just got out my little red book
The minute that you said goodbye
I thumbed in through my little red book
I wasn't gonna sit and cry

And I went from A to Z
I took out every pretty girl in town
They danced with me and as I held them

All I did was talk about you
Hear your name and I'd start to cry
There's just no getting over you, ohh, no

There ain't no girl in my little red book
Who could ever replace your charms
And each girl in my little red book
Knows you're the one I'm thinkin' of

Ohh, won't you please come back
Without your precious love I can't go on
It's hard to be, I need you so much

All I did was talk and talk about you
Hear your name and I'd start to cry
There's just no getting over you, ohh, no

Ohh, won't you please come back
Without your precious love I can't go on
It's haunting me, I need you so much

All I did was talk about you
Hear your name and I'd start to cry
There's just no getting over you

All I did was talk and talk about you
Hear your name and I'd start to cry
There's just no getting over you, ohh, no

All I did was talk about you
Hear your name and I'd start to cry

And let your poor heart break a little.

You've got to laugh a little, cry a little,
Until the clouds roll by a little.
That's the story of, that's the glory of love.

As long as there's the two of us,
We've got the world and all its charms.
And when the world is through with us,

Ted Nugent,"Oh Carol, don't let him steal your heart away
I'm gonna learn to dance if it takes me all night and day

Climb into my machine so we can cruise on out
I know a swingin' little joint where we can jump and shout
It's not too far back off the highway, not so long a ride
You park your car out in the open, you can walk inside
A little cutie takes your hat and you can thank her, ma'am
Every time you make the scene you find the joint is jammed

Oh Carol, don't let him steal your heart away
I'm gonna learn to dance if it takes me all night and day

And if you wanna hear some music like the boys are playin'
Hold tight, pat your foot, don't let 'em carry it away
Don't let the heat overcome you when they play so loud
Oh, don't the music intrigue you when they get a crowd
You can't dance, I know you wish you could
I got my eyes on you baby, 'cause you dance so good

Oh Carol, don't let him steal your heart away

Across the streams of hopes and dreams where things are really not

You lost your emotions. You're paralyzed. 

Amputate your logic, you're hypnotized. 
You show no emotion. You're paralyzed. 

Don't you know you crucify yourself, oh, no. 

You're killin' you and nobody else, 
And know you been spending your nights alone. 
The lights are on but there's nobody home. 

You don't know where you come from. You're not too wise. 
You got nowhere to run to. You paralyzed. 

Can you feel your body? Can you move your eyes? 
Can you feel your heartbeat? Well, are you paralyzed?

That we own a telephone, dear; 

Day will break and you'll awake 
And start to bake a sugar cake, 
For me to take
For all the boys to see.

We will raise a family, 
A boy for you, a girl for me.
Oh, can't you see
How happy we would be?",Tea for Two
Teddy Wilson,"You go to my head
You linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round
In my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne
You go to my head

Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two
The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought
To my plea, casts a spell over me

Still I say to myself
Get ahold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be
You go to my head with a smile
That makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julys
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance
In this crazy romance
You go to my head, you go to my head

To fall in the sea?

And you care for me!",Who Cares

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

Ever tell me he will care

I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

When I think about how I've hurt you so.

I've been unfaithful.

A feeling of guilt, oh it tortures me;
And only you darling can set me free.
 
And darling;  All, All I Need is just to hear you say you forgive me,
Forgive me baby.
All, All I Need is to have you touch my hand,
Say you understand.
A moment of weakness darling, caused me to stray.
 
When I look, look into your eyes,
I can see the hurt baby that I feel inside.
Although I've hurt you, you never once complain,
It makes me feel sweet darling, that much more ashamed.
Tears of guilt, tears of guilt running down my face,
Tears only you, only you can erase.

Forgive me baby.

When all your love darling,yes, I did forsake.
It's on my mind, it's in my heart,
This guilty feeling tearing me apart.
With ev'ry step I make, with ev'ry breath I take,
I'll make it up to you, I'll make it up to you.

I've been unfaithful I know it's true, but I'll make it up to you baby.

Planted in love by a being far beyond this
What can it be?
Such a sweet yet painful feeling,
Came over me?

[Chorus:]
Knowing this can never be,
Do I love you? Yes indeed.

I am the bird which cannot be caged completely,
Even though I long to spread my wings so bittersweetly.
What will I do ?
Shall I hold my love in silence
Wonder if you feel it too.

[Chorus]

I've heard it said that all is fair in love and war,
But tell it like it is, does the distance hide the scar
Living our lives all alone, changing,
Never really knowing what games we're playing (oh baby)
Laughing when we should have both been praying 
(Living, I'm living a lie)

You are the rush and the flow of every river,
Soft as the touch of love when you want to be the giver.
How do I know 
I guess I just imagined
Painfully so

You broke my spirit
All those nights I cried

He always keeps me guessing
But never keeps me guessing about his love
He's had more girls than Howard Hughes had money
And you may think it funny when I say he loves me only
And who are you to say what he did when I was not around
Just because I fell in love with Casanova Brown
Act 2 scene 5 is my command performance
My name is clairvoyance and it's all too clear

Who said tune in tomorrow
I think about tomorrow, even when I am asleep and
Who are you to say

What I did when you weren't around
Just because I fell in love with you

Of you and I

That the tears fall harder than the whole dam crowd

Throw it down my love
Is just about all I can do
Wasn't I the one who said
I'll have my cake and eat it to
Just couldn't wait any longer
You pushed till I was through

It hurt me but I had to let,
Let you go
Did you hear me crying, baby

You didn't have to make me cry

Scanners of our love affair
Like we were the L.A. Times
The headlines read ""Beware""
I don't deal in hearsay
Calculation ain't my game
But today I see you
And I hang my head in shame

Lipstick on your collar, and the colour isn't mine
White lines on the dresser, and you even drank my wine
Babe your face is flushed
It's more than just a hunch
Tell me what's this fear
Maybe she's still here

You cross your heart and hope to die
Promising to tell no lies
Baby you're an alibi

I can hear the engine roar

Dashes through the garage door
Now you cry injustice and synthetic violins
Every night outside my door
A candle in the wind

Teena Marie,"Two weeks ago last Sunday, I was on my way from church
I met a guy named Youngblood, who was totally berserk
He told me he was looking for a place to lay his head
I read him Romans 8:14 and this is what he said

Girl, some of my homeboys told me 'bout a freaky party
Down on 63rd and Babylon
Come on girl, let's go, I got plenty of blow, and it's more fun doing wrong
The ladies call me lover, 'cause I got the gift of gab and a few other specialties
I'd really like to make you, if you'd only let me date you
You'd belong only to me
He said I know that there's a freak deep down inside of you
Dying to get out, and oh
He asked me to help Youngblood get to the freaky party
But I'm not gonna help Youngblood get to the freaky party

I can't begin to tell you of the sadness in my mind
Knowing there was no contentment in two eyes so blind
I told him that the joy would surely bring eternal bliss
I read Galatians Chapter 4, and he said yea check this

Girl, some of my homeboys told me 'bout a freaky party
Down on 63rd and Babylon
Come on girl, get live, it's a much hipper vibe
And it's more fun doing wrong
The ladies call me baby 'cause I've got a killer smile
And they love my smooth touch
Only time will tell, if there's Heaven or Hell
Or if I'm just out to lunch
He said I know that there's a freak deep down inside of you
Dying to get out, and oh
He asked me to help Youngblood get to the freaky party
But I'm not gonna help Youngblood get to the freaky party

Girl, some of my homeboys told me 'bout a freaky party on 63rd and Babylon
Come on girl, let's ride, it's a long way to slide and it's more fun doing wrong
And the ladies call you lover 'cause you got a killer smile and they love your smooth touch
But all that you have done, you can tell to the one
Who has given you so much",Help Youngblood Get to the Freaky Party
Teena Marie,"Baby, I was just a young girl
When you came on the scene 10 years ago
I thought I was hip, I could deal with the trips
No matter how fast or slow

I was like a moving violation
Give me a ticket and I'm ready to ride
Thought I was the queen of syncopation
You know you can't give the queen no bad advice

Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby
Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby

?Cause when you kissed my lips
When you kissed my lips
I was jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time
Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

Baby, I was young, I was green
When you showed me the ropes 10 years ago
I thought I was cool, I could break all the rules
No matter how fast or slow

I was like a moving violation
Give me a ticket and I'm ready to ride
Thought I was the queen of syncopation
You know you can't give the queen no bad advice

Jammin' for the first time

Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time
Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

I was a girl from the streets
Dancin' to the beat
Of a different kind of drummer
Little Ms. Know-it-all, you don't know it all

Caught up in the rhythm of sound
Living to get down
As the song became my lover
Attitude keeps your head up to the sky

Then you kissed my lips and, ooh
I lost my cool

Look at me I'm jammin'
And everything's happenin'
I'm feeling the bliss and the reason for this
Is the love in your kiss, baby
Jammin'

Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time
Jammin', jammin'

But I didn't know it all, baby
Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby

?Cause when you kissed my lips
And my backbone slipped
I was jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

The square root of a positive groove
Times a happening melody equals a jam
Give some to the back

No
Ooh, baby
No
You got me movin' and I'm jammin' for the first time

No
Ooh, baby
No
You got me movin' and I'm jammin' for the first time

Could be wearing the same smile

Drink the milky, from the Milky Way cup
Hold me tighter, touch me, then do
All of the sweet things
That star lovers do

A strong pyramid, where secrets of life hid
Ancient hieroglyphics told
Of one man touching like Midas
He turned my love to gold

When I say how much I care
It hurts me so inside each time we say goodbye

I mark red Xs off and with each tear that drops

Has gotten out of hand, it's more than I can stand

Without really saying goodbye
Can you make it easier on me
Can you stop these tears I cry
Baby, I can only try
Can you find a reason why
Love shouldn't die

I hear what you're saying
And my love will be waiting
I hear what you're saying
And my love will be here
After your other lovers fall
If you'll only stop meeting like this...baby

Two children playing grown-up games

And left you with silence

And now I'd trade one day of wealth and fame
For just one model airplane

I'd rub Aladdin's lamp until Aladdin's lamp turned into you

And emerald city love songs
The jest and the jester
And somewhere in your nursery rhymes
I found and lost my innocence
And what could be better
And now we live in separate worlds
But here inside I'm still your little girl

Teena Marie,"Mary's into new things got a brand new bag
Superficial living made her life a drag
World stereotypes her as she coins the phrase
Living for the hot wax and the printed page
She no longer wants to boss the bull around

Contrary to popular belief
All she wants to do is get inside your head
And play the fun rythms of the street
Batucada Suite-rythms of the street
Music for the soul-Love to make you whole
Estebans a walker and a superman

Says that love will someday reign throughout this land
Says he's glad you let him try it all again
'Cause his last time on earth he lived life in sin
All he wants to do is spread his eagle wings
And fly south for the winter just like me
All he wants to do is get inside your head
And play the funky rythms from the streets

Batucada Suite-rythms for the feet
Music for the soul-geared to make you whole
Tribal drums of the African
The reggae of the Rastaman
The ragas of the Indians
Rock-n-Roll music of my homeland

Tender lutes of the Orient
The salsa of Spanish descent
Jesus music is heaven sent

Where everybody showed but no one came
And every time I looked into the most familiar face
It seemed they all had gone and changed their names

I think she never really sleeps at all

Until you happened on an Amstel Light
And even though the brew was cold it couldn't chill me out
And then somebody offered me a light
I said thank-you no Ni Nikki but you know I don't indulge

But how's about electrifying solo
He said I think I could oblige you
With my guitar even blind you
I said hey baby take a walk on the wild side

The fact we're still together baby doll, is so significant

I sign myself to you baby every time I speak your name
Back in the days when I was young and blind
Hanging with the sister's we was fine as wine
Checking you out on a regular basis
I even let you touch me in all my secret places

I'm your main squeeze, come on and squeeze me baby
Don't erase me I'm your baby

And every guy that tried to turn my head
Could not obstruct my view

Who went their separate ways
Impassioned lovers wrestling as one

Common sense may tell me that the ending will be blue
Listening to my friends all goes up in smoke
When I'm making love to you
No one knows how you do your thing.
I'm a puppet on a string
Cause still waters run deep and kisses never lie
And day light turns to darkness
Humming birds do fly
And if I loved you too much baby,
It really don't matter
Just do it, do it
Do it to me on the smooth tip
Can't nobody groove me like you do
Do it to me on the smooth tip
Cause I'm down for you
I just got caught up in a triangle my dear
Then you ran away from here
Steal my heart and then you rob me blind
But no one in the world is that fine
Cause violets are blue
And roses are red
And I forgave all of your short comings once in the bed
And even though you never touched my sensitivity
I've got to admit it
You did it to me on
The smooth tip smooth tip baby
Can't nobody groove me like you do
Do it to me on the smooth tip
Cause I'm down for you
Nice and easy so bitter sweetly
You did me on the smoothe tip-I was down for you

I'll never forget you did it to me on the smooth tip

And let me whisper something in your ear

Teena Marie,"You are the seed and the grain of every harvest
Planted in love by a being far beyond this
What can it be?
Such a sweet yet painful feeling,
Came over me?

Knowing this can never be,
Do I love you? Yes indeed.

I am the bird which cannot be caged completely,
Even though I long to spread my wings so bitter sweetly.
What will I do ?
Shall I hold my love in Silence
Wonder if you feel it too.

Knowing this can never be,
Does it hurt me? Yes indeed.

I've heard it said that all is fair in love and war,
But tell it like it is, does the distance hide the scar
Living our lives all alone, changing,
Never really knowing what games we're playing (oh baby),
Laughing when we should have both been praying
(living, I'm living a lie)

You are the rush and the flow of every river,
Soft as the touch of love when you want to be the giver.
How do I know
I guess I just imagined
Painfully so

Knowing this can never be,
Do I love you? Yes indeed

You Broke my spirit
All those nights I cried

Do I love you? Yes indeed.",Ballad of Cradle Rob & Me
Teena Marie,"Hey, baby, how you doin'
Wow, huh, it's really been a long time
You know
Remember that night
You remember

On a starry winter night in Portugal
Where the ocean kissed the southern shore
There a dream I never thought would come to pass
Came and went like time spent through and hourglass

You made love to me like fire and rain
Ooh, you know you've got to be a hurricane
Killing me with kisses, oh, so subtly
You make love forever, baby
You make love forever

[Bridge:]
I ain't gonna let you go that easy
You've got to say you love me too
I ain't gonna let you go that easy
I'm gonna give it all to you

[Chorus:]
Portuguese love
Won't you say it to me, say it to me, say you love me, baby
Portuguese love
Won't you say it to me, say it to me, say you love me, baby
Portuguese love
Won't you say it to me, say it to me, say you love me, baby
Portuguese

Harbor nights, we made love till the morning star
Then you crooned a song to me on your guitar
Was it so familiar calling soft my name (Teena)
Sunlight dancing slowly through loves window panes

And you made love to me like sugar and spice
Hush my broken heart, this must be paradise
Killing me with kisses, oh, so tenderly
You make love forever, baby
You make love forever

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Amore Portuguese
Say you love me, baby
Amore Portuguese
Say you love me, baby

Yo quiero a la ser amor
A feeling too hard to ignore
Say amore Portuguese
You've got to say you love me

You knew that you felt good to me, oh, baby, oh
From the first kiss to the last I'm trembling
You made love to me like no other man
And if you please I'd like to go back there again
Killing me with kisses, oh, so tenderly
You make love like, wee
You make love forever

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Amore, amore Portuguese
Aye, say you love me (Portuguese love)
Amore, amore Portuguese
Aye, baby, aye, aye Portuguese love

Amore, amore Portuguese
Say, say, baby, aye, aye, hey, hey (Portuguese love)
Portuguese amore, amore Portuguese
Say, say, say aye, say aye, aye, aye, hee

Portuguese love [Repeat: x7]

Love me
Say you love me
Love, love me (I love you)
Portuguese amore
Say you love me, say, say
Say you love me, baby

You know what I'm sayin', baby
Maybe that will express what I've been going through (I love you)",Portugese Love
Teena Marie,"I remember your songs
And they were timeless, Minnie
The perfect melody
You were the sweet and soulful bird

And you left a fire Marvin
Here in the darkness
To light my life, to lift my voice
To bring some peace into my world

Kyrie Elieson, Christie Elieson
I love you Lord, you head my cry
And pitied every groan Donny

As long as I live Whilst trouble rise
I'll hasten to your throne","Opus III, Pt. 2"
Teena Marie,"Wow
It's really good to see you again, baby
And I must admit you're looking very, very, very nice these days
I guess life must be treating you well
Oh, me?
Well, I've just been doin' the same ol' thing I've always been doin', you know
I've got a new lady now
And it's a little different then it was when I was with you
You know, I think back to when we met
The way I used to be and the cold way I used to act
But more than that, I think of how you changed me with your love and sensitivity
Remember when I used to

Love them and leave them
That's what I used to do
Use and abuse them
Then I laid eyes on you, it was pain before pleasure
That was my claim to fame
With every measure, baby
Tasted teardrop stains, yeah
I was cold as ice long ago, baby, baby
I wasn't very, very, very nice, you know
Sugar, sugar, sugar
Then I kissed your lips and you tuned on my fire, baby
And you burned me up within your flame
Took me a little higher
Made me live again, you turned on my fire, baby
Then you showed me what a love could do
Fire and desire, baby
Feel it comin' through
And I thank you, baby

Oh, how I thank you, baby
You taught me so much and you showed mw so much and love and insensitivity
That since you've been gone I don't think I've ever felt this way before
You know it's funny how a man can change so quickly from a cold-blooded person
Thinkin' he's God gift to women
Remember how I used to do that?
I must have been crazy then
Remember when you used to

Love them and leave them
Oh, that's what I used to do
Use them and abuse them, whoa
Then I laid eyes on you
It was pain before pleasure
Oh, that was my claim to fame
With every measure
Tasted your teardrop stains, yeah
You were cold as ice long ago baby, baby
I-I wasn't, I-I wasn't very nice, I know, whoo!
Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar
Then I kissed your lips and you
(You turned on) turned (you turned on) on
(You turned on my fire) my fire, baby
Then you showed me what a love could do
Fire and desire (fire and desire)
Feelin' good to you (feelin' good to you)
You turned on my fire (fire), baby (oh, baby)
And you burned me up within your flame (you burned me, you burned me)
Fire and desire (fire and desire)
And we're both to blame, both to blame

You know
I guess I think we both said a little too much today (no, ooh)
After all, Tee, you're kind of with somebody else
I'm kind of livin' with somebody
But please do me a favor just before you go (what is it, baby?)
Just put your arms around me and hold me like you used (I want to hold you tight)
Tell me ""Rick"" (oh, oh) ""everything is gonna be alright""
(Everything, everything, everything is gonna be alright) put your arms around me
Put your arms around me (ooh)

Oh, baby
Oh, baby",Fire and Desire [Single Version]
Teena Marie,"I feel good
I knew that I would now
So good
So good
I've got you
I feel nice
Like sugar and spice
So nice
So nice
I've got you

When I hold in my arms
I know that you do me no harm",I Got You
