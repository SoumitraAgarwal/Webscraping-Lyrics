Ry Cooder,"Jesse James we understand 
Has killed him many a man 
He robbed the Union trains 
But history does record 
That Bob and Charlie Ford 
Have laid Jesse James in his grave 

It was on a Saturday night 
The stars were shining bright 
When they robbed that Union train 
And it was one of the younger boys 
That gathered in the spoils 
And carried that money away 

In his small home unaware 
A-straightening pictures there 
He thought he heard a noise 
And as he turned his head 
Well, the bullet killed him dead 
Fired by Bob Ford, one of the boys 

Poor Jesse had a wife 
She lived a lady all her life 
The children they were brave 
But history does record 
That Bob and Charlie Ford 
Have laid poor Jesse, laid poor Jesse 
Have laid Jesse James in his grave",Jesse James
Ry Cooder,"Once I had a secret love,
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love,
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Now, I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore.",Secret Love
Ry Cooder,"3 cool cats
3 cool cats

Parked on the corner in a beat up car
Devourin' up a liquor candy bar
Talkin' all about how sharp they are
These 3 cool cats

3 cool chicks
3 cool chicks

Walkin' down the street just swingin' their hips
Spinnin' up a bag of potato chips
And 3 cool cats did 3 big flips
For these 3 cool chicks

Up pop that first cool cat
He said, ""Man, look at that
Men, do you see what I see?""
""I want the middle chick""
""And I want the little chick""
""Hey men, save one chick for me""

3 cool chicks
3 cool chicks

They look like angels from up above
3 cool cats really fell in love
3 cool chicks made 3 fools
Of these 3 cool cats

That's what they did, brothers
(3 cool chicks)
Made fools of these 3 cool cats
'Cause I'm a fool for you, baby

3 cool chicks
3 cool cats

Ry Cooder,"Mister, you’re a baseball man
As anyone can plainly see
Greatest game in this great land
Take a little tip from me

I work here nights parking cars
Underneath the moon and the stars
Same ones that we all knew
Back in 1952

And if you wanna know
Where a local boy like me is coming from
3rd base, Dodger Stadium

2nd base, right over there
I see Grandma in her rocking chair
Watching linens flapping in the breeze
And all the fellows choosing up their teams

Hand over hand on that Louisville
Crowning the top king of the hill
Mound to home, sixty feet
Baseball been very good to me

And if you wanna know
Where a local boy like me is coming from
3rd base, Dodger Stadium
3rd base, Dodger Stadium

Back around the 76 ball
Johnny Greeneyes had his shoeshine stall
In the middle of the 1st base line
Got my first kiss, Florencia was kind

Now, if the dozer hadn’t taken my yard
You’d see the tree with our initials carved
So many moments in my memory
Well sure was fun, ‘cause the game was free
It was free

Hey Mister, you seem anxious to go
You’ll find that seat in the 7th row
Behind home plate, we used to meet
When we were young, we had dreams

Just a place you don’t know
Up a road you can’t go
Just a thought, laid to rest
In my mind, just a time

You care to know where I’m gonna go
When I hit my last home run
3rd base, Dodger Stadium
3rd base, Dodger Stadium
3rd base, Dodger Stadium

Hey Mister, you are a baseball man
Yes, I’m a baseball man myself
Yes, I’m a baseball man too
Baseball been very good to me
Yes, baseball been very good to me

Ry Cooder,"Era la medianoche, when oímos the scream
""Se requieren cien taxis en el almería de Chavez Ravine""

Un montón de soldados, jóvenes y engañados
Llevaron su bronca to Downtown L.A.
Contra Los Pachucos, sin saber porqué

Brotó un desmadre, por tipo acomodado
Sobre un pedazo de tierra injustamente robado

El precio en sangre que se sacó de mi gente
Hasta tal día mancha La Loma y el Palo Verde

Como duele el recuerdo si me pongo a pensar
En el mal gusto de vida y tración dineral
Una bola de pinches, sin corazón y falso piedad
Por llenarse las bolsas se van a quemar

Onda callejera, onda sin honor
Maldita onda, onda de lo peor

Onda de lo peor

Ry Cooder,"Tell you 'bout a friend of mine that you don't know
He lives way up a road that's lost in time
Don't know his name or where he's coming from
Only thing you know
He's a real gone cat, this friend of mine

He don't have no uptown friends that drive a Cadillac
But he's got cool threads and a beat up car
All his downtown friends like me, ride around in the back
Cause he's a real cool cat
Yeah, he's a real gone cat, this friend of mine

Do anything that you want 'em to
And if you need a friend 'cause you're feeling blue

Underneath the moon and stars

What's that sound? What's that light?
Streaking down through the night
What's it mean? It's a red cloud over Chavez Ravine

Orale, UFO, come gliding low
Se cayo, up Chavez road
Space vato, square cat
Say, ""Caramba, partners, where's the party at?""

I heard about the cool jerk and the alligator
And I heard about Tokay Wine, Mary Jane, and lil' Julian Herrera
I wanna learn to dance, make romance
These La Bishop girls might take a chance

My friend say, ""No, be cool, bro'
If you want to dance slow
Learn to ask a mi hermana con respeto""

Ry Cooder,"There's a place where I've been told 
Every street is paved with gold 
And it's just across the borderline 
And when it's time to take your turn 
Here's one lesson that you must learn 
You could lose more than you'll ever hope to find 

When you reach the broken promised land 
And every dream slips through your hands 
Then you'll know that it's too late to change your mind 
'Cause you've paid the price to come so far 
Just to wind up where you are 
And you're still just across the borderline 

Up and down the Rio Grande 
A thousand footprints in the sand 
Reveal a secret no one can define 
The river flows on like a breath 
In between our life and death 
Tell me who's the next to cross the borderline 

En la triste oscuridad (In the sad darkness) 
hoy tenemos que cruzar (today we have to cross) 
este río que nos llama más allá (this river which calls us further away) 

But hope remains when pride is gone 
And it keeps you moving on 
Calling you across the borderline 

When you reach the broken promised land 
Every dream slips through your hands 
And you'll know it's too late to change your mind 
'Cause you pay the price to come so far 
Just to wind up where you are 
And you're still just across the borderline 
Now you're still just across the borderline 
And you're still just across the borderline

Ry Cooder,"Now my room has got two windows
But the sunshine never comes through
You know it's always dark and dreary
Since I broke up with you, baby

I live on a lonely avenue
My love don't say I do
But I feel so sad and blue
You know it's all because of you

I could cry, I could cry
Whoa, I need somebody
'Cause I live on a lonely avenue
Oh yes

You know my cover, it feel like lead
And my pillow, it feel like stone
But I toss and turn every night
I'm not used to being alone

I live on a lonely avenue
My love don't say I do
But I feel so sad and blue
You know it's all because of you

I could cry, I could cry, baby
Whoa, I need somebody
'Cause I live on a lonely avenue
Oh yes

Now I live so sad and lonesome
Since you left this town
You know if I could beg or borrow the money
Child, I would be a-highway bound

I live on a lonely, lonely avenue
My girl wouldn't say I do
But I feel so sad and blue
And it's all because of you

I could cry, I could cry, baby
Whoa, I need somebody

Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies

As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company

As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

Hair all a mess and a dress all disheveled

Better luck in the next life,

Tasted your lips with my hands on your hips
Danced in an apartment named nine,
Your cats on the sill and my head to your breast
Feeding your rhythms divine

Tasted the salt through your skin,
Loved you back then, but I couldn't say when

I had a firecracker waiting to blow
Breakin' like a rocket who was makin' its way
To the cities of Mexico
Lived in an apartment out on Avenue A
I had a tar-hut on the corner of 10th
Had myself a lover who was finer than gold
But I've been broken up and busted up since

And love don't play any games with me, anymore
Like she did before
The world won't wait, so I better shake
That thing right out there through the door
Hell, I still love you, New York

Found myself a picture that would fit in the folds
Of my wallet and it stayed pretty good
Still amazed I didn't lose it on the roof of the place
When I was drunk and I was thinking of you
Every day the children they were singing their tunes
Out on the streets and you could hear from inside
Used to take the subway up to Houston and 3rd
I would wait for you and I'd try to hide

And love won't play any games with ypu, anymore
If you don't wanna 'em to
The world won't wait and I watched you shake
But honey, I don't blame you
Hell, I still love you, New York

I remember Christmas in the blistering cold
In a church on the Upper West Side
Babe, I stood there singing, I was holding your arm
You were holding my trust like a child
Found a lot of trouble out on Avenue B
But I tried to keep the overhead low
Farewell to the city and the love of my life
At least we left before we had to go

And love won't play any games with you, anymore

Where do you go when you're blue

Ryan Adams,"Poor girl, no Ma
Nothing much to speak of
But a rough diamond
Sleep now and your angels will come, dear
Poor Matilda
Handcuffed hard to the wheel and
Steering wildly
Through love's fields, so blindly

Forever only takes its toll on some, oh-oh
But, tonight you're sleeping alone without him
Tonight you're sleeping alone without him
And everything went up in smoke
Like wildflowers
Wildflowers, dear

Poor girl, lonely
Shuffles through the parade
Of a sleepless circus promenade
Hold on, dear

Poor girl, no Ma
Sister steals her a coat
For the windless breezes
Sleep now and Jesus will come, dear

Forever only takes its toll on some, oh-oh
But, tonight you're sleeping alone without him
Tonight you're sleeping alone without him
And everything went up in smoke
Like wildflowers

Ryan Adams,"Took a walk with you 
In the shadow of my shoes 
Danced around the broken blues 
In the dirty summer rain 
Moonlight on the cars 
Parked in single file at bars 
With a thick and rosy smoke 
Waving its busted hand 

Bringing you down, can't bring you down 
Bring you down, can't bring you down 
Bring you down, can't hear the sound 
Run through the river and into town 
Pretty little moon with it's head hung down 
Chin up. Cheer up. 

I took a walk with you 
And I busted up my shoe 
In an old yellow canoe 
Out in Hollywood 
You called the police 
But they didn't care the lease 
On your place had run out 
Your landlord straightened his hat 

Bringing you down, can't bring you down

And dies every night with her face on the news.

You'll never guess
You know the girl you said I'd meet someday?
Well I got something to confess,
She picked me up on Friday,
Asked me if she reminded me of you?
I just laughed and lit a cigarette,
Said That's impossible to do.
Life's gotten simple since
And it fluctuates so much,
Happy and sad and back again
I'm not crying now too much.

I think about you all the time,
It's strange and hard to deal
I think about you lying there,
And those blanket's lie so still.

Nothing breathes here in the cold,
Nothing moves or even smiles,
I've been thinking some of suicide,
But there's bars out here for miles.
Sorry about the every kiss,
Every kiss you wasted bad.
I think the thing you said was true
I'm gonna die alone and sad.

The wind's feelin' real these days,
Yeah and baby it hurts me some,
Never thought I'd feel so blue,

I'm never ready to go
Twenty-seven years of nothin' but failures and promises that I couldn't keep

Oh lord I wasn't ready to go
I'm never ready to go
Let it ride
Let it ride easy down the road
Let it ride
Let it take away all of the darkness
Let it ride
Let it rock me in the arms of strangers, angels until it brings me home
Let it ride
Let it roll
Let it go

Loaded like a sailor
Tumbling off a ferry boat
I was at the bar till three
Oh Lord, and I wasn't ready to go
I'm never ready to go
Tennessee's a brother to my sister Carolina where they're gonna bury me

And I ain't ready to go
I'm never ready to go
Let it ride let it ride easy down the road
Let it ride
Let it take away all of this darkness
Let it ride
Let it rock me in the arms of strangers, angels until it brings me home
Let it ride
Let it roll
Let it go

I want to see you tonight
Dancing in the endless moonlight
In the parking lot in the headlights of cars
Someplace on the moon
Where they moved the drive-in theater
Where I left the car that I can't find but I still got the keys to

Let it ride
Let it ride easy down the road
Let it ride
Let it take away all of this darkness
Let it ride
Let it rock me in the arms of strangers, angels until it brings me home
Let it ride
Let it roll
Let it go",Let It Ride
Ryan Adams,"You plant a rose 
And if the rose comes up 
You're thankful to God 
And when it doesn't you cuss him 
You raise a child 
And when the child grows up 
You got to learn to let go 
If you can't learn to love him 

But, oh, what a beautiful thing when you sing 
Hear all them bells ringing out in the street 
Hammer strikes the metal and it makes me believe 
'Cause if I don't believe in love 
Then I don't believe in you 
And I do 

Now I'm not saying only bad news comes 
For the people who want it 
But you gotta play that music for who's listening 
You got to have someone you wanna sing it to 

Oh, what a beautiful thing when you sing 
Hear all them bells ringing out in the street 
Blue sky cracking and it makes me believe 
Oh, hear all them bells ringing out in the street 
Hammer strikes the metal and it makes me believe 
'Cause if I don't believe in love 
Then I don't believe in you 
And I do 

Close my eyes, see the glorious sunset 
Through the windows of a store and I want it 
Anyway, if I ever felt haunted 
You were there for me 

These angry people who are waiting to judge you 
Have their own judgment that they'll have live up to 
Open your mouth 
And if nothing come through 
Remember 
You're the one that sings 
And it's a gift 
And life's a beautiful thing 
Oh, don't waste it doll 

You build a house and if the house comes up 
You gotta work on that house 
If you want to make it your home 
'Cause everything inside that's not something you own 
Is what you're taking with you 
On the day that you go 

And oh, what a beautiful world when we sing 
Hear all them bells ringing out in the street 
Hammer strikes the metal and it makes me believe 
Hear all them bells ringing out in the street 
Oh, hammer strikes the metal and it makes me believe 
'Cause if I don't believe in love 
Then I don't believe in you 
And I do",Life Is Beautiful
Ryan Adams,"I want to go to Magnolia Mountain
And lay my weary head down
Down on the rocks
Of the mountain my savior made
Steady my soul and ease my worry
Hold me when I rattle like a hummingbird hummin'
Tie me to the rocks of the mountain my savior made

Lie to me
Sing me a song
Sing me a song until the morning comes
If the morning come, will you lie to me
Will you take me to your bed
Will you lay me down
Til' I'm heavy like the rocks in the riverbed
That my savior made

I want to be the bluebird singing
Singing to the roses in her yard
Roses in her yard her father grew for her
It's been raining like Tennessee honey
So long I got too heavy to fly
Ain't no bluebird ever gets too heavy to sing

Lie to me
Sing me a song
Sing me a song until the morning comes
And if the morning don't come, will you lie to me
Will you take me to your bed
Will you lay me down
Ti'l I'm heavy like the rocks in the riverbed
That my savior made
Please

We burn the cotton fields down in the valley
And ended up with nothing but scars
Scars became the lessons that we gave to our children after the war
There ain't nothing but the tunes of Magnolia Mountain
Where nobody ever dies
Steady your soul and ease your worry
They got room

Lie to me like I lie to you
Hold me down until the morning comes
And if the morning don't come
Will you lie to me
Will you take me to your bed
Will you lay me down
'Til I'm heavy like the rocks in the riverbed
That my savior made

Ryan Adams,"There's something about you
That reminds me of all those times
When I wasn't sorry, when I wasn't blue
The cherry moon it shone down on us
Under the stars shining down every one for you
If I could count them all
I would circle the moon
And count 'em back to nothing
Till I got to you

Something in you dies, when it's over
Everybody cries sometimes
If loving you's a dream
That's not worth having
Then why do I dream of you?

I used to be the house that you lived in
Down on Meadowlake Street
When you moved they cut down the maple tree
I carved your name into
The tree became a boat, I christened it your name
And when the water turned to salt
From your tears it hit the bottom of the ocean
Where I go when I hear your name
And I sink like a stone

Something in you dies, when it's over
Everybody cries sometimes
If loving you's a dream
That's not worth having
Then why do I dream of you?
Why do I dream of you
I feel like a dream that's not having
Like a nervous joke ain't nobody laughing
Like somebody with nothing 'cause they don't know
What they're wanting
Tiny like the sand in the cracks of drift wood
Washed up on the shore of an ocean of you
Boats out on the horizon
Made of the maple tree where we used to lie down
On Meadowlake Street counting the stars you and I
You and I
Something in you dies when it's over
Everybody cries sometimes
If loving you's a dream that's not worth having
Then why do I dream of you
Why do I dream of you
Why",Meadowlake Street
Ryan Adams,"Mockingbirds sing
Sing me what the Lord was singing
On the day He made the water
The color of the blues
Sing me that song
Sing me till the heavens rising
On the day He made the water
The color of my baby's eyes

Love her in the way you want to be loved
Love her in the ways you want to be loved
Love her in the ways you want to be loved

But the way I'm loving her
It must not be enough
'Cause the way she cries
It only tears me up,
I feel dead inside and dying
And if you give up

Don't give up on love
Don't give up on love
The rivers they run
They run until they get too tired
Until they run behind the houses
And they become the creek
When I was a child
I ran until the creek became the river
When it turned into the ocean
I wondered why he made it so deep

Love her in the ways you want to be loved
Love her in the ways you want to be loved
Love her in the ways you want to be loved

But the way I'm loving her
Must not be enough
'Cause the way she cries
It only tears me up,
I feel dead inside and dying

It only tears me up,

Don't give up on love
Don't give up on love

Love her in the ways that you want to be loved
Love her in the ways that you want to be loved

Ryan Adams,"When I pick up my guitar
This is the song that always comes
Don't know what I'm singing 'bout and
Don't know what for
I think about you
And I think about Rosebud

Wish there was a song to sing
To bring you back
But you can't get here from nowhere I guess
Rosebud's shipwrecked up on the Ohio
Behind a wall of glass
Telling me to take care of myself
And my friends

You sing to a field of trees
And roses singing those melodies
Simple and easy where everything moves
Underneath you
And Rosebud too

I wish there was a song to sing
To get you back
But you can't get here from nowhere I guess
Rosebud's shipwrecked up on the Ohio
Behind a wall of glass
Telling me to take it easy
But I took a photograph
And she's just a wooden machine
But you and Rosebud, you're still singing to me",Rosebud

I got nothing to say to you now
Lose the feelings that are weighing me down
When I'm sane

It's turning morning all the birds sing
I'm not complicating anything
I'll have another and then I'll go to bed
And dream of you

Cause it's almost over
Yeah it's almost gone

I can feel the sweet illusion
Sweet confusion
Sweet illusion coming down
And I ain't got nothing but love for you now

You and I used to shine like a jewel
But time's been nothing to us but cruel
So play it out and never play the fool
Cause you'll lose everytime

We were nothing,we were only the past
Hard times like that don't last
I've been forgiven,I've been surpassed
By my heart
Have you?

Cause it's almost over
Yeah it's almost gone

I can feel the sweet illusion
Sweet confusion
Sweet illusion coming down
And I ain't got nothing but love

Love for you that I can't use
Lonely nights multiplied by the blues
I can't resolve

You never knew me but you did you're best
I'm just lonely inside I guess
You gave me everything you really tried
Thanks

If we are nothing and we're only the past
Well I'm just living in a dream I guess
A long black dream that takes me down the river to you

Where it's almost over
And it's almost gone

Sweet confusion
Sweet illusion coming down

Ryan Adams,"There's something in the way she eases my mind
And lays me across the bed till I close my eyes
Stirs me in the morning till I can ever be satisfied
I leave Carolina every night in my dreams
Like the girls that try to love me that I only leave
Rock me like a baby doll and hold me to your chest
But I'm always moving too fast

If I could find my way back home, where would I go?
When everything about me, I used to be,
Shivers in the sheets and the blankets of snow
Lost out in the woods were you're looking for me

When, when will you come back home
No one leave the lights on in a house
Where nobody lives anymore
Loaded like the boxes up in the bedroom
Coming off the hinges like the door
The shadows dancing up in the window
They're not who we are but who we were
And I'm not gonna break, but if I do
I'm gonna shatter like the glass I turned your heart into
I'm broken like the windows in the house where I used to live
And If I could find my way back home, where would I go?

When everything about me, I used to be,
Shivers in the sheets and the blankets of snow
I'm lost out in the woods looking for you

Think about you to think about me

I wonder, I want to see you tonight
I want to see you, I want to see you,
I want to see you smiling back at me in the starlight
Shining on the streets downtown
I was looking for you
Looking for me, again
God I want to taste your mouth

Back you are up against the wall behind a subway station
I want to see you smile
I want to see, I want to see, I want to see you tonight
Meet me on the corner, 44th and Broadway

Did it rain, oh, God
You could be happy in love
You can be happy in love with me
That's is you want to for just a little while
No promises no guarantees tonight
Meet me in the hall
Meet me in the hall

I'm terrorizing so
You bet
'Cause I want to see you tonight
I want to see, I want to see, I want to see you tonight

And utility bills, every Monday the company calls 
I got a nice bed to sleep on 
And a chest of drawers, where I keep those jewels of yours 

Cause you're always mine to keep when you're gone 
Two silvers rings, one's on my finger and the other one's gone 
It went underground with you, oh John 

Ten years passed 
And I ended up with a house full of cats 
But most of them went missing 
On that window you never fixed, the door you never latched 

When you were on your way out like the last time

That summer when Candy came around 
But I had too much hurt to bother you 
When we lost our first child I thought a little payment was overdue 
And I wanted you so bad

The leaves burn like effigies of my kin 
And the trains run like snakes 
Through the Pentecostal pines 
Filled up with cotton and dime store gin 
Oh Jacksonville, how you burden my soul 
How you hold all my dreams captive 
Jacksonville, how you play with my mind 
How my heart goes bad 
Suffocating on the pines in Jacksonville

With a sky full of nothing but moon 
And I lose my reflection in a bottle of wine 
Till the morning comes down 
And I ain't nothing but blue (you) 
At the diner in the morning for a plate of eggs 
The waitress tries to give me change, I say 
""Nah its cool. you just keep it"" 
I read up my news 
I start thinking about her 
And I wonder if anybody here besides me 
Has got any decent secrets

Then he drove to old man Ed Sutterton's place 
To find him some peace 
He got there round about twelve 
And he stayed till three 
And the sun left him down in the valley 
But the moon met him up in the hills by the lake 
Reflecting the ghost of ma's place 

Suppertime came and went 
No one heard from him 
Sis left his food on the plate 
At the end of the table right next to ma's place 
Where nobody'd sit 

The telephone rang bout four 
My sister answered it 
And I felt the news through the floor boards 
Like a long, sullen moan 
Like a wreck on the road 
Like a joining of hands

When the sun's crawling up the sheets

Gnawing on me like I was a chew toy

Whatever I'm feeling, baby doll

And the things that you want 
Are the things that you need will last

And let yourself go blue for once

Trying not to slide
Into the ocean

But only if you want
I'm strong enough to carry you
Across the icy lake

What's left of my mind
I can't win
But for you I will try

And she's the one I'll have to climb

And let go of that pain?

Ryan Adams,"Rose lived on the south side of town 
Until her landlord showed up with two hundred dollar bills
A notice of eviction on the other hand
Now she don't live there no more
And everyone thinks he drowned

I pulled into Mecklenburg on them trains
Into a station that got flooded when they opened up the dam
And broke their connections to the railway lines
So they could blast into the quarry
And for every load of granite
We got a ton of worry

One night at the diner over eggs
Over easy she showed me the length of her legs
But that gold plated cross on her neck, it was real
And you don't get that kind of money from pushing meal

I should've told him that you were the one for me
But I lied, but I lied
To most any drifter whose looking for work is too weird
I met your sister and I married her in July
But if only to be closer to you, Caroline

Percy and I moved down the street
Until we lost two pretty girls
One was seven and one was three
Alderman and Caroline owned the house right up the hill
Where we laid those babies down
So they could still see our house

Suspicion got the best of old Alderman Haint
He owned an auto parts store off the interstate
But the lord took him home in July
And then Rose spilled the beans on the day that he died
We was in trouble 

I should've told him that you were the one for me
But I lied, but I lied
Tied up to concrete at the bottom of the quarry
With a tattoo on his heart that spelled out ""Caroline""
He was silent but his rosary
Well, it drifted into the custody
Of a sheriff that was just deputized

And I was down at the banquet hall
When two guys came up, pretty angry and drunk
And I'm still here at the banquet hall
At the banquet hall
Where the gun went off in the Carolina rain
In the Carolina rain
In the Carolina rain
Oh, Caroline",Carolina Rain

Tear myself in two
Just to hear you breathe

Turn to nothing and then multiply
Yourself by my pain

Over you is where I stand
I wish I knew why
But I don't understand

I'm waiting on someone that just won't show
And every night it seems like there's no tomorrow
Not that you will ever know

Wherever you are, I hope you're happy now
I'm caught in a dream and I can't get out
I'm caught in a dream
I'm caught in an endless dream

Wherever you are, I hope you're happy now

In an empty house
In an empty room

From a million years
Of lying and getting drunk

They are loud and in the night
They scream and smash the windows
When they fight

Please have mercy let me go

Without her I am nothing at all
The change is happening and I'm almost gone
On her heart is my faith
And it wins against the sadness

The train it moves through the desert
The horses they will challenge its stride
And into the boxcar she leaps
And is my hero
And penetrates the demons inside

The clouds they pass
But they're moving so fast
As I watch them collide
Collide and collapse in her arms like a newborn child
And I am at once reborn

As he grabs my throat
It lifts as she comes
She opens her cloak and the color of blood
It is the sign of what now must come

Deny, deny me my destiny
I am not ready to go
I am the horror that brings us to the morning
Where I will have to stand and fight God

At the starlight diner
You said, ""meet me at a quarter to twelve""
Now I'm standing in the corner
Wishing you was here
In my arms

Fare thee well, my old friends
Fare thee well

Is it possible to love someone too much?
You bet

The drugs are in the safe
And the clothes are on the couch
Intertwined
But none of them yours
And none of them mine

So cry, cry like a baby
Into an ocean of wishes
But it don't never rain
On a street drenched with
Pain and ladies

Fare thee well, my old friends
Fare thee well

Have you ever slept it off to the bones?
Haven't woken up at night, my love
And dreamt that you called them all
Every person that you can never love

It's a blowout on a birthday cake
And a birthday candle floating on the lake
Where are you? it's getting late

Now it's midnight

In fact, it broke right in two
And I fell in
The strawberry vines
Into a pool of strawberry wine
Strawberry wine and clouds
Burning in the desert, surrounded in flowers
But the stems broke the armor
And the morning comes
Until it's all just the same things again

Don't spend too much time on the other side
Let the daylight in

Before you get old and you can't break out of it

'Cause its getting winter, and if you want any flowers
You gotta get your seeds in
And I worry about you
Why? Because you want me to

Can you still have any famous last words
If you're somebody nobody knows
I don't know
Somebody go and ask Clair
She's been dead twenty years just look at her hair
Strawberry blonde with curls
She gets hair done then she gossips
With the younger waitress girls at the bar
The old Irish rose
Drinking strawberry wine
Until it comes out her nose

She spent too much time on the other side
And she forgot to let the daylight in

Before you get old you'd better break out of it

He was angry about a letter he received from his friend
He fell in
To the arms of the most beautiful girls
That have ever, ever lived in the history of the world
And with nothing left to lose he got screwed
He sold his apartment before they made him move
Then he jumped straight in
To the San Francisco Bay
Now he lives on Molly's farm
Picking berries all day

Don't spend too much time on the other side

Marty was a kid when he learned to steal boats
His dad was a deejay on the radio
He fell in
To a life of riverboating crime
He's the man you see in prison
If you want strawberry wine
Strawberry wine and smokes
He sent a letter to his friend
Explaining one night on coke
He and Clair
Jumped in to the strawberry vines
And lord knows you get lost
On that strawberry wine

Don't spend too much time on the other side

Now I'm getting old and I gotta break out of it

Like a sun that just wouldn't set out on the horizon

I took a train and came up from Carolina
I was looking for something to do
Nothing I found could ever quite occupy me
With nothing to gain there's always nothing to lose
Singing and dancing to them nighttime songs

I got arrested down south for hitting a clerk
I spit in his face, the bastard knocked me out

Go on put it to me shake it till the rattles come on
Take me where the morning don't come

I had a dog named Jet, when I was a kid
Until one day he wandered off and died
One night I went in the yard and dug him up
And he laid in the box just like a pile of bones
Singing and dancing to them nighttime songs

I used to get loaded and baby Id drive your car
It seemed like there was always a cop
Coming behind me and following close as they could
Eventually they'd just trail off
Loaded and cruising to them nighttime songs
Cry me a river till the morning comes

Bar room boogie just like in the movies
Go on put it to me shake it till the rattles come on
Take me where the morning don't come

I think I died a hundred thousand times
Mixing liquor with mystery pills
Mystery pills and heroin mixed into cocaine
Face down out on the riverside
Most of my friends are married and making them babies
To most of them I already died
And whatever it is about you I've always hated
Is something about myself I just couldn't hide
And I'm going going baby I'm gone

But when you smile it spins me like a ferris wheel
Washed out to sea in your eyes

I make these promises but all my promises hurt
It's like they never get a liftoff
So if I'm being honest with you and it seems like I'm being cruel
At least you didn't get a rip off, a rip off
A rip off
And you know how I feel ...",Rip Off

That people faded out
When there was love enough left to fix it

There it is, we are only one push from the nest
There it is, we are only one argument from death
There it is, the sun rises, but the sun also sets

Oh, be sure
You're gonna tear someone apart

Ryan Adams,"One day we are young

And by the next one we are old despite the years
And tears of gold precede the rapture

Time has its way with everyone
In its path, she combs her hair
And tears of gold fall on the grave
Tears of gold
Tears of golden restraint
As evidence of the pain that we feel inside

Mary-Anne settle down, let's bring the band around, how 'bout?
And we'll sing you to Heaven and back
Laura-Lee sets the food out on the tabletop for us
And when she asked Mary-Anne to say grace
Mary-Anne settles down wiping tears of gold from her face

Where we are strong by tomorrow we will grow weak and disappear
Our families all gather round to remember
Where we are flesh and blood, by the next one
We are dust under the wheels
Without a love, we are only ashen urns of silver
Tears of gold
Tears of golden restraint
As evidence of the pain that she feels

Tears of gold promise the rapture and heal the soul

Replacing the tears of gold with music, and laughter

And I feel alright
Yeah, I feel alright

Late night girls are anxious and they're coming out to play
I've been stranded on their doorstep for every night and day
I only want them more, it's so sad
But when they smile, God, I've been had
I get hypnotized and I wanna go to bed

I used to pickup shells cast off the reef
One Christmas I got a funeral and they handed me the receipt
How many lies I'd tell without my tongue
Get twisted into memories till I believe 'em some

And I toy with you
And you toy with me
Can you stop it please?

Two hearts, one of them will break
Like bad ideas on a beautiful day
Two figures, moving through the dark
Three words is all it takes to break your heart
In two

I just pretend that it's not happening
And every time she comes, well then she comes, oh God
So what she's right, so what if she's so beautiful
Beautiful as that

Head full of tricks and treats it leads me through the nighttime streets

Salt shaker spills just throw it over your shoulder, babe

I got a bad idea again, I got a Halloween head

Head full of candy bags, costume shops and punks in drag
Head full of tricks and treats, places where junkies meet
And it leads me through the streets at night
That's alright, I just watch, I don't go inside

Like I've got something to sell

Blowing through the trees leaving me raw

And she's inside me like a secret
And I've got no one to tell

Our love is there above us holding everything so still

For everything but this.

Feels like a thousand in my heart and soul

Be tired of himself so much he must be more
Than disappointed Christmas comes we eat alone

Takes your order she yells it and cries alone in
The backroom once in a while until it stops

His hunger to leave well it gnawed his poor heart alive,
Her skin smelled like black cherry, blossom perfume,
The sail boats they all sailed by
And a river she cried.

And the wind was suddenly sweeter? than Roosevelt pine,
The windows broke out and the cigarette smoke drifted by,
The bums on the bowery were swallowed in the lights as cars rumbled by in the night
Screaming run for your life.

With cool and silvery eyes
And a heart was fit for desire,
Drowned in a river of tears
Oh a river? she cried left her with a heart
Made of ashes and fire.

One day there was a silence and it washed through the town,
There was no reason to speak and no one made a sound,
Her eyes were indigo and the cats were all calico
And the sail boats they all sailed by
And a river she cried.

Nobody has to cry
To make it seem real
And nobody has to hide
The way that they feel

If you'll stay right here
Tomorrow you'll be fine
I will be here for you
Standing by your side

So come home, come home

You built those walls
To hide your fears inside
We were younger then
It's safe now to come outside

We built this home
On this little piece of land
The sky above is dark
No rain comes in

Nobody has to cry
To make it seem real
Nobody has to hide
The way that they feel

If you'll stay right here
Tomorrow you'll be fine
I will be here for you
Standing by your side
So come home, come home

As the storm grows stronger deeper and wide
My face a winding river with no riverside
As the years grow longer I will be here by your side
Ashes to dust and storm by storm
Forever I will always be your love

Nobody has to cry
To make it seem real
Nobody has to hide
The way that they feel

If you'll stay right here
Tomorrow you'll be fine
I will be here for you
Standing by your side
So come home, come home",Come Home
Ryan Adams,"Last time I was here, it was rainin'
It ain't raining anymore

The books scattered across the floor
And the church bells are ringin' through the sirens
And your coat was full of bullet holes

When the night is silent and we seem so far away
Oh I love you but I don't know what to say

I was lost, I was lost
Tried to find the balance, got caught up in the cost

Used to have the goods
That when I could use 'em

So don't let go, don't change your mind
If the stars fall into the ocean side
Someone hold the ribbons from my eyes, free, my soul
Let him roll away on an invisible riverside

I didn't travel far
But my feet were moving
Couldn't read the signs
They were too confusing
Standing by the ocean

I wanna lay my head forever on your shoulder

And the dark will bring you down
And the night will break your heart
But only if you're lucky now

Waiting outside while you find your keys
Like bags of trash in the blackening snow
City of neon and toes that freeze
We've got nothing and nowhere to go
We've got nothing and nowhere

And the lights will draw you in
And the dark will take you down
The night will break your heart

And if the lights will draw you in
And the dark will take you down

I'm not sure what there is to say

I am not rock, I am not rain
I'm just another shadow in the stream
That's been washed away after all these years
I am not rocks in the river
I am bursting in tears for it
And the day is dawning

Whatever it is you wanted I think you got
But take a little something to light the way
Inside your mind when the weather is gray
I believe the sun still rises here but when it falls

It's just too much pain
If someone can save me
Come the morning, I will remain

And your careless heart

Everywhere I've been
Following me again

Choking the life out of me

Ryan Adams,"As he stared past the fire,
His hunger to leave well it gnawed his poor heart alive,
Her skin smelled like black cherry, blossom perfume,
The sail boats they all sailed by, and a river she cried.

And the wind was suddenly sweeter than Roosevelt pine,
The windows broke out and the cigarette smoke was drifting by,
The bums on the Bowery were swallowed in the lights as cars rumbled by in the night 
Screaming run for your life.

With cool and silvery eyes and a heart that was fit for desire,
Drowned in a river of tears oh a river? she cried left her with a heart, made of ashes and fire.

One day there was a silence and it washed through the town,
And there was no reason to speak so no one made a sound,
Her eyes were indigo and the cats were all
Calico and the sail boats they all sailed by, and a river she cried.

With cool and silvery eyes and a? heart that was fit for desire,
Drowned in a river of tears oh a river she cried left her with a heart, made of ashes and fire.

That were written for the fella who broke your momma's heart
And the envelope folds, smelled of her ancient perfume
I'll bet she didn't know
How to respond before the blankets of snow
Caught him out wandering alone
With no place to go

There were stars in the sky
There were houses on the hill
And there bottles of pills that were easy to buy
To keep her warm from the oncoming storm

Well I found them in the northwest corner of the attic in a box
Labeled ""tinsel and lights""
Didn't know what I was I looking for
Maybe just a blanket or artifacts
Eisenhower sent him to war
He kept her picture in his pocket that was closest to his heart
And when he hit shore
Must have been a target for the gunman

There were bunkers on the hill and there were caskets to fill
Where he will lie
Shrouded in the red white and blue with the stripes

It's hard I got the windows down
I wish I could call you
I wish you were still around

Nothing much left in the tank
Somehow this thing still drives
You forgot what it needed
But somehow still survives

Hey, you're my wrecking ball
Won't you come and maybe knock me down
Hey, you're my wrecking ball
Won't you come and maybe knock me down
Hey, you're wrecking ball
Won't you come and knock me down

Come and knock me down tonight

Lying in the bed at night
Feeling like I'm somebody else
My thoughts inside my head get lost inside that haunted house

Everyone I used to know
Left their dreams by the door
I accidentally kick 'em that's how I can tell you're still not sure

Watching cars go by

Carries me away into the undertone
At the bottom, there's no air, there's no sound, no light

Somewhere
Hanging from the side

Lost in outer space

Driving past your church and all the houses in a row
The feeling in my chest is fire
Broken glass and wire

See my smile?
I’m thinking of the days
Light reflecting in your eyes
It was never the same

I wanna lie down
I wanna ride in your car
You could take me anywhere
Roll us into heaven I don’t care

You will always be the hardest thing I will let go
Driving past your church and all the houses in a row

And I pour my thoughts
Down the drain in my head

There ain’t no one inside
Staring through the screen
Looking back at my fucking life

The longer it takes
Daylight is so close I can almost taste it
It's all I got, it's not right

Ain't no place to run
Ain't no place to hide
Don't wanna lose control
Baby I just might

Black candle, fire on the fuse
Shaking in the wind like a lame excuse
Never leave the house, barely leave the room
Got nothing to say, got nothing to prove

Hell is rising in front of my face
I'm free from desires, I rise above the maze
Every step I take, closer to the sun
Darkness is so loud, surrounding everyone
Ghosts dwell in the streets from a hit and run
Keep your head down
Keep your eyes shut tight
Don't wanna lose control
Baby I just might
Don't wanna lose control
I just might
Don't wanna lose control
I just might

You make a wish, you want it to come true
But somewhere underneath all the hope is the truth
Prayers go unanswered

It's a slippery slope

Dark as a room with the light shut out
I'm feeling round the walls for another way out

Shattering the light on the oceanside
Standing alone, I am not waiting

Straight to the fall, before the film is through
Today in my head, that field of reason why
Come a little closer, honey

Shadows

Heaven waits, in the darkness of a room
And the shaking at the gates,
From here to Timbuktu
Cold front rolls in, like a black balloon
And it sinks into your soul
And you tell it what you knew

How long do I have here with you?
How long do I have here with you?
How long?
The flowers that once were anew
Are shadows

The mystery of the stars
That fell from your eyes
Watch it as it burns

Screaming, crying, perfect storms

When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months, and months of back and forth
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
Hung my head, as I lost the war, and the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do
When the butterflies turned to dust, they covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof, ah ah
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing

And the rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean

Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older I won't give in
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it

Ryan Adams,"Looking at it now, all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch, I remember
You took a Polaroid of us, then discovered
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we in, are we in the clear yet, girl?

Looking at it now, last December
We were built to fall apart, then fall back together
Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't forget, when we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying

Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we in, are we in the clear yet, girl?

Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we in, are we in the clear yet, girl?

I remember when you hit the brakes too soon
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out and said ""I'm setting you free""
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
And when the sun came up, you were looking at me

Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?

Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise

I should just tell you you should leave

Watch us go around, 'round each time

You've got that Daydream Nation look in your eye
I got that pent up love thing that you like
And we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style

So it goes, I can't keep my eyes on the road

High tide, came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, on and on

And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone
In silent screams, and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good
This love is bad
This love is back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
This love came back to me

Tossing, turning, struggle through the night for someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on

It's the last house at the end of the block
My friends all disappear one by one

The cracks in the windows and the spiders, they crawl
Across the lattice from 1924
Life is too sweet, yeah, and life is too short
And there's nowhere to fall

And I don't want to live in this haunted house anymore
I don't want to live in this haunted house anymore

There's a painting on the wall
I see its eyes watching me as I walk on down the hall
Nobody stops to write, nobody calls
My friends all disappear
They all got lost

The cracks in the windows and the spiders, they crawl
Across the lattice from 1924
Life is too sweet, man, and life is too short
And there's nowhere to fall

And I don't want to live in this haunted house anymore
I don't want to live in this haunted house anymore",Haunted House
Ryan Adams,"How am I supposed to know
When it's time to go
In the middle of the night
When I'm all alone
Don't know what to do
Don't know what I'm even supposed to say
Like a train gonna go
Till it starts rolling away

And cars don't move in the middle of the night
Lost inside the void of the fading tail lights
Swear I wasn't lonely when I met you, girl

But I was so bored, I was so bored
I don't know anything anymore

I got this achin' in my chest
Rollin' 'round like a pile of bones
In a broken little box
It sounds a lot like you
Laughing to yourself
In a quiet room
Our eyes knowing more than they probably ought to

And cars don't move in the middle of the night
Lost inside the void of the fading tail lights
I swear I wasn't lonely when I met you, girl

But I was so bored, I was so bored
I was so sure, I was so bored
I was so bored, I was so bored
I don't know anything anymore

Walls are all cracked
The fan stutters in the room
Where we slept
Where I woke up next to you
Sometimes a man don't know
When he's got to walk away
I hear a rumbling and a moan
I feel like an outbound train

The cars don't know move in the middle of the night
Lost inside the void of the fading tail lights
I swear I wasn't lonely when I met you, girl

I was so bored, I was so bored
I was so sure, I was so bored, I was so bored

Ryan Adams,"Free my heart
Somebody locked it up
Still waiting on parole
I can taste the freedom just outside that door
Same gray walls
Same great calls
Mmm, I know my friends all know
Can't keep it under control

I know our love is wrong
I am a criminal
Mmm, I am a prisoner
Mmm, I am a prisoner
For your love

There's this one bird
Lands on the sill beside the bars
How can something born with wings
Ever know freedom to truly be free
Clock don't know what your memories do
They're stacking up beside the bed
I count 'em every night inside my head

If loving you is wrong
I am a criminal

Ryan Adams,"Midnight coming, I can feel it in the air
I hear your voice, run your fingers through my hair
I reach out for your hand but I know it isn't there
I pick up my phone and I shiver and I stare

Morning coming early every day
I can barely sleep, I been lying here awake
I close my eyes, I see you with some guy
Laughing like you never even knew I was alive

Maybe I'm a fool, doesn't matter anyway
My chest is all tight, my heart still aches
These are the days, you need double what it takes
I've missed you so much I shiver and I shake
I've missed you so much I shiver and I shake

I've been waiting here like a dog at the door
You used to throw me scraps, you don’t do it anymore
I miss your loving touch, I miss your embrace
But if I wait here any longer I'm gonna fade away
If I wait here any longer I'll just fade away",Shiver and Shake
Ryan Adams,"Strong winds and my head's on fire
Walk another day across the high wire

I'm on a tightrope, watch it as it swings
Like a countdown ticker on New Year's Eve

We run the numbers spinning in the side
Counting all the reasons that we're broken and we lied
I'm on a tightrope, watch, it isn't easy
Heating up the metal, putting pressure on the springs

All I want is for you to make me smile
All I want is for you to drive me wild

Pretty candles on a birthday cake
Covered in confetti with the caffeine shakes
Fuck all the money, everything is trash
Papers in the glove box, light it up and pass
Flip on the tube, we watch it 'til we sleep
Ain't nothing but static and the panic and the feeling manic

I'm on a tightrope, watch it as it swings
Like a countdown ticker on New Year's Eve

But a bag of tricks and a broken noose
Nobody hangs around that's got something to lose
If I was born to be the loner, okay
But I'm not made of stone
And I'm so blown away
Don't know what's the rubble
And the parts I want to save

We disappear and we fade away
We disappear

Maybe tomorrow the sun will shine
But the moon is full and what's on my mind
Is like a bad commercial in the movie of my life
Was I alone, am I still?
Nobody gets in, nobody ever will
You deserve a future and you know I'll never change

We disappear and we fade away
We disappear

A beggar's cough, so musical and blind
Must've crossed the railways 'til he lost this mind
Hard to tell the difference, didn't matter anyway

We disappear and we fade away
We disappear

Broken mirror and my hand starts to bleed
Wish I could explain but it hurts to breathe
Didn't fit in my chest so I wore it on my sleeve

We disappear, we disappear
We disappear, we disappear",We Disappear
Ryan Adams,"Walking by your house, I see the light
Shining down upon the land

What I wanna know is are you home?
What I wanna know is are you home?

Light will shine, I might go in
Not if you're gonna pick up again
Walk to the store, see that guy
Used to make fun of the way he was dressed
And the way that you batted your eye

What I wanna know is are you home?
What I wanna know is are you home?
What I wanna know is are you home?
What I wanna know is what I wanna know?

I've crawled to you on my hands and knees
Sailed to you across the seven seas

I've come to you from broken times
I've shown you my face with no disguise
My memories a mirror without eyes
If only to take away your pain
If only to hear you say my name

You're the whispering in the rising wind
Empty and so cold too dark for the birds to fly in
And they're lined up on the wall
And as I'm walking by, they scattered and take off
I watch them as they rise into the sun
If only you believed you were the one

When the day is new the light is warm
Upon the bed the curtain is drawn and torn
The shadows forming, falling just behind
If only you believed all of my lies

Hanging in my heart just like a flag
When I'm lazy the wind, the colors sag
As the clouds rolling off the hill
Can't tell where the roofs begin and end
No more will I know my home again

Hear the whispering in the rising wind
Empty and so cold too dark for the birds to fly in
They're lined up on the wall

Maybe everything is not okay
I feel so crazy now

Wonder if you're coming home again

Pretty things also have to fall
We're the earthquake, I'm what's on the wall

And all your pain left us in the houses to cry
And all your pain left us so speechless and shy
Out in the rain

Ringing your number, I would just run to where you live

Ryan Bingham,"If you ever see me walking down the side of the road
Do you ever stop and wonder why
Would you think it's lost that I paid the cost
Stop and give a poor boy a ride
And forget my past

I'm never gonna worry 'bout the things that I could've done
'Cause I've done a lot of things I could've done better
But now it don't matter none

'Cause I've raised my glass

I fell in love and then lost touch
I dropped it and broke her heart
I drove off a cliff
And I barely missed
Walkin' days through the park

With a selfish boy

But I have not forgot that the food in the pot ain't cookin' for a boy like me
I been fightin' all night with the dogs in the alley, looking for a bone to eat
Been starving to death

I guess I'll be in pretty good shape

I scribble on down the lines

Hung with the hippies in Austin and the cowboys of Mexico
I've laid up in Fort Worth with beautiful ladies

In the back of a Ranchero, I rode down to Laredo
Had a good time at the la posada, yea you know I was left alone

If you stray there is no change, in the end you're gonna fall

Burn me down, I'm a book, not a page

Lay on the table the rest of your lies
It's time for you to go

Ryan Bingham,"The other day I found myself up on the corner
I thought I run into a friend of mine
Ended up that he was just a stranger
I said hello as he passed me by

But then he turned and put a gun to my head
He said, my friend I'm going to rob you blind
I said you must be down on your luck
I'm out of money and I'm all out of time

He pulled the trigger and I fell to my knees
My spirit left and then my body went cold
I'm looking down upon the lights of the city
I feel alive, but I'm dead and gone

Ain't no more walking down the side of the road
Ain't no more sleeping on the edge of a frown
Ain't no more favors from someone I don't know
'Cause there ain't nobody hear me, nobody's around

Hallelujah, I'm coming home
Hallelujah, he's dead and gone
Hallelujah, something's wrong
Hallelujah

So tell me now if your singing can bring me
Another day with my feet on the ground
I miss living and living misses me
I miss it so much that I'm holding me down

For all the things that I never could change
For all the reasons that I never understood why

I feel alone, baby
I'm dead and gone, baby
There's somethings wrong
'Cause you know I still feel alive

My train is rolling down the line
And I'm waiting 'till it bring me a dream
For holding you up in my eyes
Oh feel my love, honey
From up above, honey
Oh don't give up on me 'cause I'm coming down

I'm not a one nighter
I'm not a flat liner
I've everything in between the harmony you're singing loud

I shot 'em dead and I hung my head, and drove off his in his car
So on the run with a smokin' gun, lookin' for the coast
Of all the things I've had and lost, your love I miss the most
And hell will have to pay
I went a little bit too far I'd say
Half drunk I stumble on the whiskey from the bar
Sleepin' on the Santa Monica pier with the junkies and the stars
For when I woke a Spanish cross, was reachin' for my hand
Then the stranger took the place, the words I couldn't understand

And there's nothin' but the ground
It's the only place I found
Where I can lay my head in town

Down on the boulevard, the sidewalk shuffles change
Cracked out from the night before, hallucinatin' in the rain
So I borrowed me a quarter for a call to the other side
I told God that the whole damn world was waitin' in line to die
But not me, this time
I left the trouble far behind
And he tied his arm off one more time
The man come to shake my hand, and rob me of my farm",Junky Star

The ground above, the sky below you
Must beat the hell out of being alive

How many times can I forgive you?

I've tried so hard to outrun you

Love here, my head, along the way
If ever brings, I will step down
It's only the wind, knocking me down
Some say that angels, were all looking down

My only soul, vultures circling around
With no help from god, the shadows fall
Sometimes the truth is scared of the dark
I did my weakness, with all my doubts
And trade in my secrets, to figure it out

With no help from god, forever I roam
Till I found your heart, I was on my own
I feel the alter, sake of my bones
And I hear your tender, kiss for my own
With no help from god, we stood all alone
And followed our hearts, and bury the stones

With no help from god, I will stand proud
Stand by your side, under the clouds",No Help from God

Among the crowd, say all loud

Of the ghetto
For the rising, of the ghetto

There's no turning around, we will never be put down
Alive and well, we have not the time to fear

Running from flashlights, in alleys on dark nights

And keep us at arm's reach, in case there's a war to feed in

And everybody's tired of the fellows

And left me without food for supper time

And all my doubts were killed

I could fight it

Shining on the outside
Empty on the inside

Feel your heart beat, deception is intense
And you think I didn't know

It's like Bombay traffic in my mind
How can you keep up with all your lies
And you think I didn't notice

I said keep your enemies close and your lovers closer
I'm letting you know the show is over now
So lean in closer now

Well, keep your hands up so I can see
I think it's too late, you got the best of me
So lean in closer
Keep your enemies close and your lovers closer

And it's toxic but you can't refuse
The first to volunteer to be abused like this
Well, don't act like you don't know
We're in the bedroom of your very best friend
I'm fucking guilty

I'm letting you know the show is over now
So lean in closer now

Well, keep your hands up so I can see
I think it's too late, you got the best of me
So lean in closer, lean in closer

don't say that we're something were not
If we think to much then we're gonna get caught
Don't say that we're something were not
The truth is maybe I wanna get caught

Frozen people, frozen lungs
Frozen buildings block the sun

Only man I ever think of with regret

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Wake me up when it is over

Describing eveything that you've missed
So far I'm kickin this bad habit on my own

It takes me to the safest place

Why do they hide in the basement?
Pretending everyone’s safe from
This master plan I made up
Inside my head

How foolish do you think I am?

We got smoke to roll

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

How long can a gal go on dreaming?

Ryan Kisor,"War, war, war, war, war, war, war
On a silent shore
I spoke to god
The sun is down
Assemble the great pandemonium
War

One more down by the brook of Babylon
One more down in accordance with my fate
One long drift across the lake of Avalon
One more trip that I must create

And my eyes sweep a shore
That was always there
A blood red line
Through the sonisphere
I can't resolve where it's coming from
I sense it's the great pandemonium

One more, just one more
Just one, just one more day
One more day by the pits of hell
Just one more when even yesterday was too late
One more thought that I have to sow
One last trick that you can't debate

War

On a silent shore
I confronted fear
I spoke to god
But he wasn't there
The sun is down
And the war begun
Assemble the great pandemonium

Growls
Break down
Got to break down
Break down

And my eyes sweep a shore
That was always there
A blood red line
Through the sonisphere
I can't resolve where it's coming from
I sense it's the great pandemonium

On a silent shore
I confronted fear
I spoke to god
But he wasn't there
The sun is down
And the war begun
Assemble the great pandemonium

Just one, just one, just one more day
Just one, just one, just one more day
Just one, just one more

And I wonder if you'll ever find out how it was supposed to be, baby
Said I wonder if you'll ever find out how it was supposed to be, baby

Now when I thnk back the days you were mine
Oh how I wish I can flip a switch to turn back the hands of time (oh baby)
You were the one that made me real
Now that you're gone tell me what in the world am I suppose to feel.
Without you here with me

And I wonder if you'll ever find out how it was supposed to be baby
Said I wonder if you'll ever find out how it was supposed to be baby

Listen
Something tells me I've been wrong
Of the love I felt that you should have given
Never thought you would leave me on my own
But I see that it's over
And I hope one day you're mine

Tell me, if I left you out of the blue
Would you fight back tears while your heart gets torn to pieces

Left me out of the blue

I should've been more true, takin' better care of you,

I had to make moves
And when I got mine, I came and get you
You couldn't believe the way I flipped it
Did it that smooth
I couldn't believe it was that easy to impress you

Its so uncanny how I knew that you were the one
You were a pretty little thing, had all the fun
I been to city after city, looking for love
I, want, you, ah
I wouldn't spend a penny though I had all the change
You made me switch now I'm thinking another way
And outta all these other women I got to say

Told you, you was fly, you said ""that's what they all say""
I made it easy; you showed me the hard way
Even though the look in your eye was like foreplay
I got some great taste in women
I've had a lot but when it comes to great face, you're winning

Is it the accent the hype or the way she walking
Am I, am I dreaming or am I sleep walking
Got my arms out stretched so I don't bump into her
Silly me now I'm so into her fashion
To her style her dress
And I'm looking in the mirror like do I look fresh? do I?
Do I look fresh enough to get her,
If I see her one I'm then I wont forget her

'Cause I, I took a picture mentally when I pulled up in the black on black bentley
I really feel like she was meant for me
If she wasn't then I know she was sent for me
Cos she, she's the only one that made me chase
Got me singing love songs like baby face
And I tried to one night her but she made me wait, she made me wait, hah!

Its 8 o clock now we dating, inevitably dudes be hating
But I, I still gotta flaunt my chick
I laugh, no surprise that they want my chick
Shes... more than they can comprehend
British dudes idolize me they copy him
Hes just to witty, game is too gritty,
Look at his track record man, there's too many
Tens, that's too many to count
I spin, that's a any amount
No matter to sum homey got the cash to cover it
And I when wanna see she be fast to mother it
Yeah, just so she can take my ends
Would I let her to it hmm, well that depends
Can she raise a young king? my blood is royal
And if she can man it aint a thing to spoil her

So I think she got something, she got something
Yes she got something, something that I like

You could call my phone, you could swing over my way
On your nights alone, you could come over my place
If he treats you wrong, let me give it to you my way
Just remember that you're not, you're not my girl

Without theses secrets it would feel so incomplete

Went overseas and had 'em cop cars whipping slow
They're looking funny I was bad with a black band
Eating everybody in the game, Pacman
The only issue is, it's not a game,
I've got these kids looking at me, saying ""What a shame!
He's so underrated, he should have sold more
Should've had a number one record with his own tour.
Look at his live show, look how we touch dem keys,
Look how dem girls scream when he fall to his knees!
Look how he pour his heart out when he tell a story.
I guess I had to spill my guts so I could get my glory!

Listen,
Have you ever even seen such determination?
Despite it all, I'm still a theme for the adulation.
Everything I ever wrote I did it form the heart
Never had a top ten but you still respect my art.
I'm in the club and they still send me free bottles,
Still push that G-55 with a super model.
It's my reality, this ain't no show, brother
Go check my girl on the February Vogue cover
And catch me whipping through the city in that silver Jeep
Kids screaming ""Oh, that's Ryan Leslie"", yeah, they know it's me

I'm not ashamed at all, in fact I love my story,
No matter what it takes oh, Ima keep my glory!

Shit!
The glory, give it to me!
oh, oh, oh! Yeah
I get it
The glory, give it to me!
oh, oh, oh!
Yeah

You asked me why I'm rapping,
Well I give you the reason,
The same reason you're hating when you should be believing
It's in your heart to hate, it's in my heart to win,
So yeah, I'm rapping now, let the hating begin!
I write my own records, write my own checks,
Wondering which hotel which city I'm calling home next!
One thing I know for sure, one thing that's mandatory,
I owe it all to God, I give him all the glory!

Shit!
The glory, give it to me!
oh, oh, oh! shit, get it, the glory, give it to me
oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah

Ima get my glory,give it to me! oh, oh oh, yeah

Ryan Leslie,"Tell you something you don't know

I just tell 'em what they wanna hear
Soon as you don't give a fuck that's when they wanna care
She say the truth is overrated like underwear
And if the shoe fits, she want a pair
Yeah, I tell you something that you don't know
`Cause if you don't water plants, then they won't grow
I drop jewels, she pick them up and kick them up
Legs in the air and give it to me, stick them up
Tell me it's mine, tell me it's mine
Biggest lie in the world, like yeah baby I'm fine
Yeah maybe I'm lying, but I am fly
Say they see me in some trues that's a ? lie
Ah, Louie V bow made if I call names
Game time, uniform no ball game
Beautiful lies not as good as they sound
Truth to those in the box cause they couldn't be crowned
(Nice)

And if you're feelin how I'm feelin put your hands to the sky
(It's so unforgettable)
'Cause we only gon' get this moment one chance in our lives

Anytime, anyplace, no control when we're throwing the sheets
Where my pretty girls at? My 2 door coupe
I fit a couple in the back, baby voulez vous
Coucher, I beg the kid when they say that we didn't
`Til your girl's curiosity killed the kitten
Only problem is the paparazzi
Cause you're outside my hotel tellin` me grazzie
Armani custom sheets and the tub Versace
The whole world loves to watch me
I just can't help it
Now being fair

Ryan Leslie,"Your red lights
Ain't never slowing me down, oh no no

Uh yea
My passion a reason for my existence
My success the product of my persistence
Self-made, I did it with no assistance
Luxury suite view through these Cartier lenses
Huh, and we started in the nose bleeds
No my feet up on the wood in my own seats
Court-side and it's cheap bucks versus Knicks
Watch my homie B Janice, drop 36
And that's a definition of, when pain meets love
That it turns the game, and you earn your name
Them girl come, will you earn your fame?
Get off me, I'm too hot, you can't burn a flame
And my teacher told me, that my rap dreams were ?
I still pursuit them even though I seem ridiculous
The taste of success bittersweet like licorice
A flight with the wings of Icarus
And when I achieve, I could turn with much satisfaction
To reply Michael Jackson was not ?
So back to my ? dreams of riches
More money, more balls, more rings, ?
Yet many believe in God but they ain't religious
I'm suspicious, I believe in them digits
I believe in them digits

So picture me above the sky
Shine a brighter day, sunlight
I'm a write a name in the stars
So everybody knows who we are

And I'm a be about, be about, be about, 
Be about, be about, be about it

Before they even think about, think about, 
Think about, think about, think about, think about it

Yea, let the black flag fly uh
Yea, and it's a waste when this new money can't buy taste
Bought yourselves some Versace, mispronounce it Vercese
It's my time, blow your mind like an ounce to the face
Yea I do believe in miracles, heaven is so empirical
And you could see the way I climbed up the ladder
Education, Ivy League, I'm talkin mind over matter
And so called innovators is always asking for favors
Then they take the credit to the fruit of your labor
But not me, I'm a beast, that's JF Leccord Jeezy
Not many can say they play keys with Eas-E
Or they had a couple girl on their knees to please me
I can't leave the game, not yet, it still needs me

Uh, so let the black flag fly
My vision of ascending the heights that rap can't buy
It's fully realize when I open my eyes and stop dreaming
I'm stuntin' while you lames is scheming
Kiss the ring, I got the gifts of a king

So picture me above the sky
Shine a brighter day, sunlight
I'm a write a name in the stars
So everybody knows who we are

Man, I'm such a fiend, this is psychedelic loot
I'm countin' 20 stacks in this Pignatelli suit
My 'Diamond Girl' she loves the way the precious stones adorn
And accessorize the fashionable clothes that's worn
And when she moves she's an aphrodisiac
And I complete the circle 'cause I'm everything she lacks
And when it starts to rain, that's the time I'm goin' in
I take her zig-zaggin' underneath Missoni throws
She's soaking wet, I rip the fabric from her skin

It’s a crazy life, yeah it’s a mad world
Where good dudes will betray you over a bad girl

And bad girls, they take advantage of good dudes
Smear your name in the press and call it good news
Oh he hot now? oh he blowin’ up?
Call the cops restraining order for showin’ up

If I was you I’d be seeing if I was OK
We had a problem you didn’t call me the whole day
Your girlfriend picked up the phone and hung up on me
Who is she to do that she don’t even know me

Fuck the “He say she say”,
The ‘blame game’ blasting Kanye on the freeway
I called my mother up for advice she said son, you should hold your heart

You should work it out wit me tho I’m the one who caused it
I should’ve cleaned the skeletons from my closet
Drivin’ to my apocalypse with 400 horses

Drop dead gorgeous unfair advantage
You deserve an Emmy award for all your antics
Caught up in a battle of curse word semantics
Tryna find our way back home from Atlantis

Reading about your new first date like it’s meant for me
Tryna stay focused on winnin’  yeah, hold my course
Meanwhile you infiltrated my heart a Trojan horse

Baby work for this camera that you're appearing on
Go, go, go and get it girl
Give me everything you got like there's no tomorrow
Go, go, I know you with it girl
Let me make this movie hot like I'm Modevar
And I know you are pleased to see me
The kitchen kind is cold but the scene is steamy
And like the re-run that you seen on TV
I'm a rub like dream of genie, that's classic

Whether you ready or not, we right here (Right here)
This is the moment for making love
I don't care if the neighbors might hear
How we get down, get down
Whether you ready or not, we right here (Right here)
This is the moment you're waiting for
I don't care if the neighbors might hear
How we get down, get down

So don't be scared if you ain't prepared
I know it's people everywhere and it's illegal here
But since time flies and we all die
Let's make a movie, one time for the archives (yeah)
Let's do it one time for the lovers
And one time for the haters jealous of us yea
Just give it to me girl
Baby, just give it to me

What it is
What it does
What it is
What it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the internet and checking out who hit me, get up

Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby

Yup, Bad, moonwalking
This here, is our party
My posse's been on Broadway
And we did it our way
Grown music
I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I’m on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But, I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was 14
With the four track bussing
Halfway cross that city with the backpack
Fat cat, crushing labels out here
Nah they can’t tell me nothing
We give that to the people
Spread it across the country

Nah they can’t tell me nothing

Now can I kick it, thank you
Yeah I’m so damn grateful
I grew up, really wanted gold fronts
But that’s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y’all can’t stop me
Go hard like I got an 808 in my heart beat
And I’m eating at the beat like you gave a little
speed to a great white shark on shark week
Raw, time to go off, I'm gone!
Deuces goodbye, I got a world to see, and my girl she wanna see Rome
Caesar make you a believer
Nah I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Nah sing a song and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure gain humility and then we keep marching I said

Ryan Lewis,"I was seven years old, when I got my first pair
And I stepped outside
And I was like, momma, this air bubble right here, it's gonna make me fly
I hit back-court, and when I jumped, I jumped, I swear I got so high
I touched the net, Mom  I touched the net, this is the best day of my life
Air Max's were next,
That air bubble, that mesh
The box, the smell, the stuffin', the tread, in school
I was so cool, I knew that I couldn't crease 'em
My friends couldn't afford 'em, Four stripes, some Adidas
On the court I wasn't the best, but my kicks were like the pros
Yo, I stick out my tongue so everyone could see that logo
Nike Air Flight, but bad was so dope
And then my friend Carlos' brother got murdered for his fours, whoa

See he just wanted a jump shot, but they wanted to start a cult though
Didn't wanna get caught, from Genesee Park to Othello
You could clown for those Probings, with the Velcro, those were not tight
I was trying to fly without leaving the ground,'cause I wanted to be like Mike, right
Wanted to be him, I wanted to be that guy, I wanted to touch the rim
I wanted to be cool, and I wanted to fit in,
I wanted what he had, America, it begins

I wanna fly
Can you take me far away
Gimmie a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high
I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Stitch my wings
And pull the strings
I bought these dreams
That all fall down

We want what we can't have, commodity makes us want it
So expensive, damn, I just got to flaunt it
Got to show 'em, so exclusive, this that new shit
A hundred dollars for a pair of shoes I would never hoop in
Look at me, look at me, I'm a cool kid
I'm an individual, yea, but I'm part of a movement
My movement told me be a consumer and I consumed it
They told me to just do it, I listened to what that swoosh said
Look at what that swoosh did. See it consumed my thoughts
Are you stupid, don't crease 'em, just leave 'em in that box
Strangled by these laces, laces I can barely talk
That's my air bubble and I'm lost, if it pops
We are what we wear, we wear what we are
But see I look inside the mirror and think Phil Knight tricked us all
Will I stand for change, or stay in my box
These Nikes help me define me, but I'm trying to take mine, off

I wanna fly
Can you take me far away
Gimmie me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high
I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Stitch my wings
And pull the strings
I bought these dreams
That all fall down

I started out, with what I wear to school
That first day, like these are what make you cool
And this pair, this would be my parachute
So much more than just a pair of shoes
Nah, this is what I am, what I wore, this is the source of my youth
This dream that they sold to you
For a hundred dollars and some change, consumption is in the veins

And now I see it's just another pair of shoes",Wing$

Of a world that sleeps outside
As still as it was midnight
Is heaven left behind?

It's a book that has no story
Shakespeare had no time
Or is it like poetry that never ever, never ever rhymes?
Baby, wait your turn 'cause you might crash and burn

And you're runnin' and runnin' just as fast as you can
'Til the ground's a blur
And you can see it, almost touch it with the palm of your hand
Watch, you don't crash and burn, crash and burn

Like a movie with no ending, fame at any cost
How do we know what's precious
If innocence, innocence is lost
So let's wait our turn before we crash and burn, oh

And you're runnin' and runnin' just as fast as you can
'Til the ground's a blur
And you can see it, almost touch it with the palm of your hand
Watch, you don't crash and burn, crash and burn

For it to survive just a listen

Ryan Montbleau,"He was the son of a loving business man,
Young days filled with affluent affection.
Late nights all alone, walking along those suburban roads,
Searching for some cosmic connection.

And as he walked those tree-lined roads,
He would swear himself a sacred oath
To always reach up endless toward the sky.
Walking through the midnight dew
He would curse the lack of something new
And he'd stare up at the sky and wonder why'

Why it's all been done before
And so it will again.
'Nothing new left for me to do,' he said.
And it's all been done before
It''s all been tried and true and said,
There must be something somewhere out there someone left.

She was the daughter of a military man,
Each year marked by a different direction.
Seasons spent in the solitude of some transitory plan
Running from any constant connection.

And just as she might settle in
The orders came to leave again
And she'd stare down at the ground and refuse to cry.
Bags packed and off to go
She would swear herself a silent oath
To someday stay in one place just for a while'

Because it's all been done before
And so it will again.
'Nothing new is ever new,' she said.
And it's all been done before,
It's all been tried and true and said,
And it makes no bit of difference in the end.

They met on a moonlit night when the evergreens were waving
Ever so slightly in that misty western wind.
He walked along his usual path
And she sat upon her brand-new, old fence
And through the haze of the streetlight their eyes met.
Their eyes met'
Their eyes met'
And then they started up a conversation,
Just a simple little conversation
And that was it.

And though it seemed like endless nights and days
It did not take long for him to say,
'You''re the one for me, I'll buy you a diamond ring.
And together we will see the world,
Walk every inch upon this earth,
We will climb the highest mountains,
Sail the shining seas,
Do everything.'

And she said,
'No, it's all been done before.
Worry not your head.
Me and you is something new,' she said.
And it's all been done before,
It's all been tried and true and said,
'I want you, not something new,' is what she said.

And he lifted up his head,
Looked her in the eye,
And said, 'I think I understand
For the first time in my life.
That it's all been done before.
And it's all been done before.
Ain't it beautiful

It's been time since I have written
For the things that we have given
Me and all my brothers and my sisters and the lovers in the street

All saving a lonely goodbye
For a time we're born to shun
But surely someday soon will come
But we will pass pleasantries, even under the gun.

Here's my open letter to the words written by feathers dipped in the ink of several generations' blood:

Throwing fits through conduits to future generations
It's a fools game to rule
In the practice of what's already done

Composing a lonely goodbye
For a time when you are gone
To any victim yet unborn

But we will tell it like it is, even under the gun.
It's taken most of what I am to understand that we are in the same boat.
Despite the things that I might say,
My will is never far away to keep going
To keep going
To keep on going, going, going, going, going, even under the gun.

Here's my open letter to the president of which whatever white-brick palace in the mud:

Spending slashing underhand
From high up not to understand
Your fellow man, who walks in line and makes the most of his time
While you're shouting a lonely goodbye

Not to let the people know that you could ever let it go
But we will tell it like it is, even under the gun
We will move right on, even under the gun.
We will dance right on, even under the gun.
We will move right on, even under the gun.",Under the Gun

And gave my life a second look
It read 'Blessed be the poor'

I just can't keep it in
Sick and tired of the situation I'm in
And I'm sick of the bills that are weighing me down.

Bus is late, couldn't wait,
Took a chance on the 64
It's my luck, it doesn't rain on me, it pours.
Take note I've got a one way ticket to hell.

If I was half the man that I try to be,
Just to live my life in harmony
My pockets need to be sewed to hold my dreams

I want the key to the city that's held me down

And my face on a board saying,vote me number one, yeah.

Don't tell me money's nothing
Look around, I can't get a job
But I work to live, 
I don't live to work.

So my head's all filled with ""yes I can""
And my suitcase packed with my master plan
With my lucky penny swinging around my neck

If I was half the man that I wanna be
With my feet step to some degree
But the only way that I need to go is up

It's my time to shine, on the picket line
And my letters begged and my picket sign
Get, your, hands, up.

Ryan Sheridan,"I've worked my days away for what?
For someone to say well done
For someone to say good job!
Well its not for me!
Don't need no-one to hold my hand
I feel this quest of life, and say if I am wrong
Or begrudge me if I'm right!
But don't get me wrong at all, my friend
Your knowledge is in my head
And these stories are far too long but intriguing, my friend
But why don't you piece what you can say
That thing at the back of your mind
That thing that is hacking away
Every day and every night

I got lost to find my way
Still I'm standing in the dark
With the one hand holding on to night 
And one to day

Its all to do with what you need
And being what you want
Leave it on your desk
Don't leave it in your bag
But I've got the view to get me home
The means to get me there
The fire in my soul, and the lighter in my hand
And I disagree what I've been told
To listen to myself,
I'm my one and only man who can make me who I am

But you tossed a coin to pick my path
To even out my odds 
Two faced that leaves me blind
So you can leave me in the cold

I got lost to find my way
Still I'm standing in the dark
With the one hand holding on to night 
And one to day

Smooth walking
Take my time to reach the canyon
Smooth talking
The only thing that slows me down from fast thinking
To the day I missed the way
I was fire!
Move closer!
Nothing matters when you're out, you're
Not nothing
Till you let your feelings go, that
Tight fisted
No expression face you have
It won't work!

Still I'm standing in the dark
With the one hand holding on to night

Help to carry on when the troubles come your way.

I have been loving you so wrong.

I hold onto you as you hold onto me;
I'm afraid to come.
I wait there for you as you wait here for me;
I'm afraid to come.

I will not dance with you no more.
My lips, my face, my dick is so sore.
Tell me who you'd rather be;
The fool in you, the king in me.

I hold onto you as you hold onto me;
I'm afraid to come.
As I wait there for you, you wait here for me;
I'm afarid to come.

Here, in my room, on the floor,
With the blade in your hand,
I see you bleed.
You always bleed.
These numbered days
Are on your skin.

I hold onto you, as you hold onto me;
I'm afraid to come.

RyanDan,"Vado con te nel mondo dei sogni
Dove tutto e' possible
All'alba come luna te vai
Ma nel cuore tuo mi porterai

Chorus:
E mentre il mondo gira
Ascolto la musica
Che canta la tua
Anima
Ma sono perso per te
Come lo sei tu per me
Per sempre sarai
Dentro me

Insieme tutto sembra magico
E voliamo come rondini
Anche se non see'e' piu la luce qui
Questo amore e' un lume dentro me

RyanDan,"Traveler of the great divides
Vagrant on a path to life

Everyday feels a little closer
To where it is that you're headed for
Given to a hope of so much more

[Chorus]
For every time you fall apart
There'll be a soul to guide your journey
But if you choose to turn away
There in the mirror
You'll see my face
You'll see my face

Think you're on this road alone
Looking for a truth untold

Many times you've been close to breaking
Giving up and letting go
Something inside says it's not over

[Chorus]

And when the world crowds your space
Remember days when noise was silent
Now empty vows, loveless displays
Just a sense of knowing
You'd see my face
You'd see my face",The Face
RyanDan,"Well here I am with so much to offer
Nothing to do but be here today
Giving myself it's the best I can do if I'm needed
Use my strength in anyway

[Chorus]
If we all work together
We would be stronger
If we all open our eyes
We could see further
If we all stand tall enough no one can beat us
If we all hold our hands up high we can carry the world

And all I ask is that we be honest
Do what we can if we're gonna stay
I want to make you a promise
Love and understanding
Is the game I want to play

[Chorus]

With my hands with my feet
When I dream when I sleep
From the start here inside I believe

If we all work together
We would be stronger
If we all hold our hands up high we can carry the world

RyanDan,"I tried to hide from you
But I failed
I tried to lie to you
But how I failed
And even in my darkest time
You gave me light
I never knew this kinda love could feel so right
When I'm in your arms
I find myself believe it
We could be anywhere
So I can keep on dreaming

[Chorus]
Whenever your close to me, you're like the sun
You feel like the sun
And everyday you telling me
I am the one
I am the one who makes you shine

And I know
Whenever you want me to, I'll go
And even when your not with me
I feel you there
I only have to look and see
And I'll know where
When I'm holding you
The world can stop it's turning
You're always gonna pull me through
And I won't be returning

You're like the sun
You keep me warm
You're telling me

And watch us where we go
And help us to be wise
In times when we don't know

When we lose our way
Lead us to a place

To a place where we'll be safe

I pray we'll find your light

When shadows fill our day

Lead us to a place
Guide us with your grace
Give us faith so we'll be safe

A world where pain and sorrow will be ended
And every heart that's broken will be mended
And we'll remember we are all God's children
Reaching out to touch you
Reaching to the stars

We ask that life be kind

And watch us from above

RyanDan,"July we sat on the rooftop
Watching the city lights
School days and heartbreaks racing to each finish line
The first time I kissed her
Surprised that she kissed me back

Goodbyes
They put on their bravest faces and waved as I went
I left so unsure, not knowing where I would go next
The looks on their faces I kept, to remind me of home

[Chorus]
I think of my life
As moments in time
The ones you don't catch
Unless you look back
Are the moments that you keep your whole life through
That stay with you
That stay with you

She said, I love you but I just can't stay
I remember her hand and its weight
On my arm as she said its okay
She was right all along

[Chorus]

It's not about the money
It's not about regret
And it's not about the things that you wanted
That you never seem to get

[Chorus]",Stay with You
RyanDan,"Even roses need their thorns
Every evening needs its dawn
Just as rivers reach the sea
In that moment, you reached for me

And I never turned away
Best decision I ever made

[Chorus]
And I'll remember all my life
Maybe it was just one time
Can honestly say
That when it came to it I know at least
You needed me
You needed me

Now it's the measure of a man
That took me time to understand
That it takes courage to walk that road
You're the strongest I've ever known

Things may never be the same
But I'm still grateful, it turned out this way

[Chorus]

And until my final day
I will always feel the same

About how many times
I've thought through all this before
Been pacing circles on the floor
Inside of a suitcase, eating on a map
Oh, I wake up I don't know where I am
And I need to touch, but I can't promise you that much
'Cause what once was hot, by two gets colder
And three, I'm looking over my shoulder
Wondering, what will I miss
If I commit to this, and choose to stay?

Oh, you know that I would
You know that I would
If I could stay
Oh, you know that I would
You know that I would

I've been thinking that it can't be wrong
Just to see where it leads, it might even be fun
But hey, what happens when I'm gone?
So then again, I think I should forget the whole thing?
'Cause waiting on a letter or the phone to ring
Just slowly breaks you
As you wait for words you think will make you stay

Oh, you know that I would
You know that I would
If I could stay
Oh, you know that I would
You know that I would

So it seems I can do nothing for you baby
Like this I can do nothing for you baby

Oh, I know that I should hold on tight
And not let that girl out of my sight
If it's worth the wait
If it's not too late
Then it's not okay
To let her get away

Ah, but you know that I would
You know that I would
If I could stay
Oh, you know that I would
You know that I would

Oh, I know that I should hold on tight
And not let that girl out of my sight

Waiting for the dude to come down my way,
Praying, wishing, hoping, thinking,
And I felt my emotions sinking.
I've been waiting for the phone to ring,
I check constantly, but it was all a dream
I never thought you could be so mean!
Tired of the waiting, so it's time to come clean
And why do boys have to be so shady?
First it's all good and he's glad you his lady
Baby this, baby that, see another chick and he act like that.
But the thing with me, I can't take it,
Kept it a hundred, was real, now face it!
You gonna eat your words and I'mma make you happen

And you wanna feel his touch,
Put your hand in the air, let them know that you truly care

All the lies and the trust games,
Guessing, age don't make a difference,
And I'm getting fed up, so listen!
First you told me that you loved me dearly,

I loved you, did I make that clearly?
And you're thinking that you can play my game,
But I wanna think twice, so retain my claim
And I'm kinda mad at myself, cause I let you get the best of me,

Tell that chick that she better get at you

Me and you always together!
Too bad I was too much clever, can't be played a fool
That's never.
Suppose she made you happy or whatever
Learn from the past, proceed, get better

Guess you didn't realize just what you had

Hear my heart beat, major keys
Nothing competes
When love is free

My compass may be broke
But you follow where I go
And you never really seem to mind it, sun
Stare it in the eye, now I'm blinded by the light
But seeing you with eyes wide open

Just the echoes of scars and the unbeaten road
Trip the gun on cautions that I've been sold

To want more than the truest of blue and a love like a roar
I will run to wherever I want to go

Ryn Weaver,"Oh, father time
That meter maid who lends one lively winking eye
We dance a borrowed jig while hiding from the fine
Oh, what I wouldn't spend to lend you mine

Nobody knows where they are going
Oh, how we try to wrap our minds
Over the edge of all our knowings
Be it a bang of the divine
Tip of my iceberg, blues are showing
I've never been on for goodbyes
So, till I meet you there, I'm singing
A traveling song to ease the ride and so you know

Everywhere I roam
I'll see you on the road

Oh, I take it in vain
All the plans and moves that we made
Half a heart is aching to grow
Soulmates aren't just lovers, you know
I know, I know your eyes are the rain
Just a soul that's changing its shape
I'll be laughing all of the way
Thinking 'bout the days

Oh, nobody knows where they are going
Oh, how we try to wrap our minds
Over the edge of all our knowings
Be it a bang of the divine
Tip of my iceberg, blues are showing
I've never been on for goodbyes
So, till I meet you there, I'm singing
A traveling song to ease the ride and so you know

Everywhere I roam
I'll see you on the road

So, farewell to my friend
He who taught me to love like a beast
And to feast like the queen that he fed turtle soup
Little boy from Paris to the states, check the facts
That was Magical Max
He was black sheep and mischief and love for his craft
And he told me that I was Apollo 13 on that very last day
He said shoot for your dreams, little girl
To the stars, well, I'm taking you with me now
This one is ours
And I know what you'd say, you'd say, on with the show
So on we go",Traveling Song
Ryn Weaver,"And now I see technicolor
A movie-script lover
You chase me while I play the clown, oh
But then you know, oh

I tend to stack the deck with wild cards
You're betting all you've got on a broken heart
I say don't
But now you know oh

So I curse my stars for a fair game
While you nurse my scars and the old flame
I'm a fool for you, I'm a fool for
I'm a fool for you, I'm a fool for
I'm a fool for you, I'm a fool for
If I let you down, like I tend to
I'm a fool for you
I'm a fool

And now I see shades of roses
Your love I suppose is an ocean
The ebb and the flow, oh
And undertow, oh

But I can feel the rogue inside my veins
A wave to crash the castle we made of sand
Oh, I hope
It doesn't show-oh

So I curse my stars for a fair game
While you nurse my scars and the old flame
I'm a fool for you, I'm a fool for
I'm a fool for you, I'm a fool for
I'm a fool for you, I'm a fool for
If I let you down, like I tend to
I'm a fool for you
I'm a fool

Old dog, new treat a shorter leash
I cannot breathe, I lock the door
You flood the gate
Tic tic, too late but still you know
I'm a fool for
I'm a fool for
I'm a fool for
I'm a fool for you",The Fool

In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake

North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes

Ryo Kawasaki,"I heard from a friend today
And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me 
In my mind

How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many
I know you did

I come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
never fall again

Making love to you
Oh it felt so good and
Oh so right

How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

So here we are alone again'
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss

I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
No never fall again

Kinda late in the game and my heart is in
Your hands
Don't you stand there and then
Tell me you love
Me then leave again
Cause I'm falling in love with
You again

Hold me
Hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me
God knows I do
Love you

Ryo Kawasaki,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Ryo Kawasaki,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)
Always
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)
Always
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)
Always
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)
Always mm mm

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude

With memories
That never die

And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude

Send back my love

And even if I could it'd all be grey, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay, my head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today, I'm late for work again
And even if I'm there, they'll all imply that I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad, it's not so bad and

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life
Push the door, I'm home at last and I'm soaking through and through
Then you handed me a towel and all I see is you
And even if my house falls down now, I wouldn't have a clue

Hit the bodega for a 40 ounce son, Garcia Vega
Two bags of chips, and one pack of Now & Laters
Flame tucked down to my nuts, on my last buck
Only thing keep a nigga calm is a good fuck
Loose-leaf cigarettes be dipped in wet
Chicken of the seas get trapped inside my net
With their clothes off, son when the gun goes off
I'm bound to play Napoleon, and blow a nose off 
Your Sphinx; your stumble rap style, your flow's off
Like Kunta, tryin to run with his chopped toes off
Unchallenged sword I yield the storm rider
Clip full of ruffled-tip fast-actin long fire
Four hundred grain cartridge, with steel casin
Those who can't draw the crowd is still tracin
The mic is cast to the floor and shapeshifted
Heavy as the hammer of Thor you can't lift it
So tense, bitch there's no defense
This four-four inch'll make you jump the fence
Right eye squinted; I speak brok-len english
Stumble off the cold four,oh of Olde English Wu brew
Two-two inside the shoe
No describin what this heat, in my jacket could do
I teach, seeds to read, never reach for the weed indeed
Bow down to the great Bob Digi Digi

(Bobby) Yo, it must be Bobby
(Bobby) Oh, no, it must be Bobby
(Bobby) Oh, no, it must be Bobby
(Bobby) Oh, no, it must be

I keep rice soaked in coconut milk mixed with tofu
Sit in the sun six hours then I charge up like Goku
Dragonball Z; imagine you're raggin me
That's like walkin through a Blood hood flaggin a C
Not, tryin to tell you how much weight we carry
It may get, every snake in the tri-state buried
Plus, Feds had one add, sayin I gun traffed
I sold twenty million records bitch; some laugh!
Fresh shafts of morning dew on Nancy Drew
Sherlock Holmes crime sleuth couldn't figure the Wu
You loaf of bread head, keep a sober head
One point five million years my overhead

(Bobby) Yo, yo, it must be Bobby
(Bobby) Yo, yo, it must be Bobby
(Bobby) Oh, no, it must be Bobby
(Bobby) Yo, check, yo

I keep MC's puzzled keep my dogs in the muzzle
Ice cold forty ounce drink 'em down with one guzzle
Son might spit a word at a bird, see if she chirp back
Tall chocolate deluxe buttercup, off the meat rack
A chickenhead scratch the yard for worms
And roosters walk around with their heads in the perm
I be spreadin knowledge keepin my third eye polished
Never, chase for dollars to fulfill the black wallet
You must be Bellevue son I walk with twelve jewels
Afford anything this world could sell you
Beats that the change the style'll rearrange ya
BZA-Bobby! I'm strikin you like Beatlemania

Yo, it must be Bobby
Oh, no, it must be Bobby
Yo, son, it must be Bobby
BZA-buh, BZA-wha', BZA-Bobby

Where mayor guiliani rest at, so let me get that
Microphone up off of you, cause it's
Definitely not meant for you to have it in your palm
To try to rock the crowd
Puttin it all on to stay calm
You waited for the god islord to drop the bomb
And swarm the stage about a hundred fat
With lyrical material that's all that
Like a two point five carat clustered jew-el
Rock like patti la-belle
Cause everything is real kid, you dead up
Dissect the true kids gettin set up
For a car/jeep heist, it ain't nice
As we ran up in the crib and stuck the kid
And smacked the wife, cause she, had on two chains
With a tray full of ice in em

All you analog cats from weak tracks, and weak raps
And weak video clips and weak stacks
Beatin bitches with weak lawyers, and weak acts
And weak staffs, born life couldn't copyright
With weak math, come get a dose, of the strong
Coconuts splittin, all you chocolate deluxe butter alms
French buttercups, probably want to see bobby in handcuffs
With the toes in my mouth
Stand up or rape me, rotate auto-locate me
In the center solar
Corner block hip-hop now expand to the polar
Fuzzy low short frequency
Circuit breakers, try to take
Us on illusionary rides to the future
Polygram graphic rap actors, flash ya
Cash and jewelry like bus passes
That's why your ass got stuck up
So wake the fuck up or get smoked
Analog rhymes hoes are like groupies we fucked
Took for derelict, sales are too soupy
Better get the bobby digital movie!

Tarantula, that groove season
Newlywed of rap, which g you believe in?
Rally back, twist a half a man arm off
Late night, nearly happy standoff
How boldly blinded by bobby crossthievin van diva
Lever 2000 mic talk
Might bolt to match, pinch me in the eve
Carved perfectly from god
Manufactured through the eye, came puma dash

Half a coke dutch sprinkle sage

Candy to a baby why'know, I'm ready to take it 

She spread your wings like a peacock 

Girl you be the bomb, and Bobby be shellshocked! 

Behold as I shape and mold your formless globe 

into a perfect O, and breathe the breath of life into your nose 

With the fragrance of a fresh pink rose 

and stroll into your eyes, the windows to your soul 

And choose the best part, the dark pupil I chose 

Your heart was mutual, into the center I dove 

Backstroke in your abyss like a fish 

Countin every thought and dream and wish, that exists within six 

She was filled with pleasures, of all measures 

But never took the time to discover, her own sunken treasure 

Unlock the jewelry box, knowledge rose to the top 

The distilled back in the fine mists, that gave birth to the crops 

and seas, that brought us together, for the better 

We could never separate so maintain your stormy weather

And like doves, we makin love above the bright moonlight 

You know I fills you, so let my love pass and spill through 

your sexual vessels, that bless you then fills you 

up with knowledge and wisdom you understandin 

that bring forth the power refines your whole planet 

She couldn't maintain this heavy slang that I dropped upon her 

She claimed it never rains, down in Southern California 

Bein a black man is most prominent and all dominant 

I couldn't wait to get her home so I could explore her dark continent 

And put my fountain, between her hills and mountains 

Impingin every square inch of her circumfrence I was countin 

Twelve trillion, four hundred and seventy-eight billion 

one hundred and eighteen million, four hundred thousand ways 

to make children, by buildin 

Detected a fine mist but couldn't resist, I told her, 

""You want to travel inside my head and see if you could rise above six?"" 

Then tilt her at the axis then bent her at her equator 

and stuck the diamond might deep inside the crater

How it was it all started? 

It was fighting off this blackbird 

Although it was only a tenth of the bird's size

Hoverin the city inside the Wonder Woman's invisible jet 

Clouded by the Meth we move undetected 

in secret society sects, NARC's radar 

suspected us to be a cumulus cloud, ejectin lightning 

Strikin like a wild knuckle fight, in New Brighton 

A million strands of spider webs weaved to make my vest 

The energy compacted deep within, my inner chest 

One touch of my eagle claw clutch, rips your guts 

Brass head kill you fast with a rapid, head bust 

Ninjas spyin, the ammo flyin, the steel iron 

Blow a nigga neck from his head, like dandelions 

My team is a magazine of M-16's 

But we calmly, defeat your army, by blowin steam 

Noisy as a thousand barkin dogs, rap's sweat hogs

You worry Duck, you get touched by the razor cut 

You feel the flurry huh, don't worry yo 

You get cut by the razor, yo, yo, yo yo

Carry large black guns in small school bags 

Funeral date, will be engraved on the wall, in roman numerals 

The Looney Tune niggaz I be rollin with, be screwin you 

Quick to make a nigga shit in his pants, with one glance 

Laid back like a fat Huffy bike, on the kickstands

Yo diamond crystal rings sharp like icicles
nickel plated pistols, official Wu-Wear covers my physical
Insulated thermal while others drain they co four butt solos
Photographic photo type static great motivated soldier
Or Wu say boulder head flower
You can detect the true and living God from the scorer
Keep your sword straight, maintain your weight
But he ate too much monosodiumglutumate, and polysorbate
And drug rate concentrate, with sodium benzoate
By the chicken thighs and tryglycerides
And this bitch advertised her breast size
Eighty-five didn't realize, til the truth opened up his eyes
Then he became highly civilized
and spent time amongst the wise, went through a garment renaissance
and stopped wearing Benetton
Tommy Hill, Perry Ellis, Nautica, or Liz Claiborne
Ocean Pacific, Fila, Bill Blass and leave fitted
Quit the Armani sweaters with the Gucci wool knitted

RZA,"What dey gives you blood?
Three months man
Whatchu doin in here anyway?  You oughta be home with your momma
How old are you boy?
Thirteen
Thirteen?  Damn, the bastards must be runnin outta niggaz to arrest

Yeah, ohh yeah, this goes out
to all the families that went through the struggle
Yeah, from the heart
It was from the heart, everything was real

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

Yo, dwellin in the past, flashbacks when I was young
Whoever thought that I'd have a baby girl and three sons
I'm goin through this difficult stage I find it hard to believe
Why my old Earth had so many seeds
But she's an old woman, and due to me I respect that
I saw life for what it's really worth and took a step back
Family ain't family no more, we used to play ball
Eggs after school, eat grits cause we was poor
Grab the pliers for the channel, fix the hanger on the TV
Rockin each others pants to school wasn't easy
We survived winters, snotty nosed with no coats
We kept it real, but the older brother still had jokes
Sadly, daddy left me at the age of six
I didn't know nuttin but mommy neatly packed his shit
She cried, and grandma held the family down
I guess mommy wasn't strong enough, she just went down
Check it, fifteen of us in a three bedroom apartment
Roaches everywhere, cousins and aunts was there
Four in the bed, two at the foot, two at the head
I didn't like to sleep with Jon-Jon he peed the bed
Seven o'clock, pluckin roaches out the cereal box 
Some shared the same spoon, watchin saturday cartoons
Sugar water was our thing, every meal was no thrill
In the summer, free lunch held us down like steel
And there was days I had to go to Tex house with a note
Stating ""Gloria can I borrow some food I'm dead broke""
So embarrasin I couldn't stand to knock on they door
My friends might be laughin, I spent stamps in stores
Mommy where's the toilet paper, use the newspaper
Look Ms. Rose gave us a couch, she's the neighbor
Things was deep, my whole youth was sharper than cleats
Two brothers with muscular dystrophy, it killed me
But I remember this, mom's would lick her finger tips
To wipe the cold out my eye before school wit her spit
Case worker had her runnin back to face to face
I caught a case, housin tried to throw us out of our place
Sometimes I look up at the stars and analyze the sky
And ask myself was I meant to be here... why?
Yeah, yo

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

Word up mommy, I love you
Word up
It was all you, word, you brought me in like this

I sit and think about
All the times we did without, yeah
I always said I woudn't cry
When I saw tears in your eyes
I understand that daddy's not here now
But some way or somehow, I will always be around, yeah
All things that I did from this to them
Oh from drugs to being there
Being down and out and I love you always

Yeah, you say
You see the universe, which consists of the sun moon and star
And them planets, that exist in my space
Like man woman and child
You understand?
We got to keep it real, and what reality and reality will keep it real with us
I remember them good ol days
Because see, that's the child I was
What made me the man I am today
See cause if you forget where you come from, heheh
You're never gonna make it where you're goin, aheh
Because you lost the reality of yourself
So take one stroll through your mind
And see what you will find
And you'll see a whole universe all over again
and again and again and again and again
Heheheh, yeah heheheheh ahaheheheh

See you on Pickens with a bunch of chickens how you're clickin'

Caught me like a fresh-water scrod, or may I not be God

Ooh baby I miss you, your sweet tender touches
Take pulls off the dutches, orgasm in my mindstate
Masterbate in your clutches, I want you for self
Like wealth, so play me closely
Bitches paranoia for the sting, who want the most of me
Only a hard dozen want to be callin' me cousin
Thirsty for my catalog, baby shoppin' spree you're lovin'
Call me if you want to get dug like the pockets

Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)

This rhyme you digest through the RZA console
Ask why I slam nine diagram pole
Raekwon dropped the bomb, Hunchback, Norte Dame
Golden Arms is bronze, buddah palm hit Qu'ran
It blows extreme, mean stream be the theme
Supreme team, America's Cream Team, redeemed
Vidal Sassoon, chrome tones hear the moans of Al Capone
Gun POW to the dome
And split the bone, wig blown off the ledge
By the alledged, full-fledged, sledge RZA edge
One dose of my feroc(ious) handheld trigger cuts
Acapella spitting shell paralyzed when you get touched
And critical mic cords, hanging like umbilical
Cords, dope swords, five star general
Raw be the quote rap style sore throat
Through the fully operational, handheld tote mm-hmm

Yes the shit is raw, coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more

A hundred thousand times one, snatch up my styles get done
I hold a title, and here's how my belt was won, check it
Slick majestic, broke mics are left infected
Germs start to spread through your crew through lack of effort
You asked for it, shot up the jams like syringes
My technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges
Masked Avenger, I appear to blow your ear like wind
With a freestyle, sharper than the Indian spear
So sit back and let the king explore
Describe me, the kid's nice and he holds swords
And his name, black attack's the nerve like migraines
With more gains than beggars on trains, livid sharp pains
Poisonous Rebel like Deck, you can't destroy this
You get ambushed, skate, try to avoid this
Side effects of, hot raps and hot tracks
A duffle bag full of guns son, dipped in black
My culture, glides and attacks just like a vulture
Ghostface in Madison Square is on your poster

Yes the shit is raw, coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)

Be on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect
That fills more body bags than apartments in projects
And as far as the coroners know
The autopsy show, it was a Shaolin blow
Put on by my family brought to the academy
Of the Wu and learned how to
Fuck up yo' anatomy, steadily, calm and deadly
Spatter-head lyrics I lick through your transmit
MC's submit to the will as I kill your
Juvenile freestyle, civilize the men-tal
Devils worship this like an icon
Bear-hugging mics with the grips of a python

Yes the shit is raw, coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)

You heard other raps before but kept waiting
For the Son of Song, I keep dancehalls strong
Beats never worthy of my cause, I prolong
Extravangza, time sits still
No propaganda, be wary of the skill
As I bring forth the music, make love to your eardrum
Dedicated to rap nigga beware of the fearsome
Lebanon Don, Malcolm X beat threat
CD massacre, murder to cassette
I blow the shop up, you ain't seen nothing yet
One man ran, trying to get away from it
Put your bifocal on, watch me a-cometh
Into your chamber like Freddy enter dream
Discombumberate your technique and your scheme
Four course applause, like a black dat to dat
You're stuck on stupid like I'm stuck on the map
Nowhere to go except next show bro
Entertaining motherfuckers can't stop O
In battling, you don't want me to start tattling
All up on the stage cause y'all snakes keep rattling
Bitch, you ain't got nothing on the rich
Every other day my whole dress code switch
So just in case you want to clock me like Sherry
All y'all crab bitches ain't got to worry
Can't get a nigga like Don dime a dozen
Even if I'm smoked out I can't be scoped out
I'm too ill, I represent Park Hill
See my face on the twenty dollar bill
Cash it in, and get ten dollars back
The fat LP with Cappachino on the wax
Pass it in your thing, put valve up to twelve
Put all the other LP's back on the shelf
And smoke a blunt, and dial 9-1-7
1-6-0-4-9-3-11
And you could get long dick Hip Hop affection
I damage any MC who step in my direction
I'm Staten Island's best son fuck what you heard
Niggas still talking that shit is absurd
My repertoire, is U.S.S.R
P.L.O. style got thrown out the car
And ran over, by the Method Man jeep
Divine can't define my style is so deep
Like pussy, my low cut fade stay bushy
Like a porcupine, I part backs like a spine
Gut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design
I know you want to diss me, but I can read your mind
Cos you weak in the knees, like SWV
Trying to get a title like Wu Killa Bee

He should meditate up on being up to blocked 
By arrows, rifles, spears and swords
Being carried away by surging waves
Being thrown in to the midst of a great fire
Being struck by a lightning, and shaken to death by a great earthquake
Falling from thousand foot cliffs, dying of a disease
Committing seppiku at the death of one's master
In everyday when one fails, one should consider himself as dead
This is a substance of the way of a samurai

Nigga I don't want to talk
I own one, ghost gun, briefcase in this equilibrium
It's the killa on your block, melodic flux
War flock, of perfected, dead it, bloods chop it up
And the birds of a feather, fly together
Intellaced moving mo' murder messages of me and Leatha Face
I'm your retainer, your perfect stranger
36th Chamber, Wu-Tang banga
I hit the dust and bust a straight no braina
Heavyweight gaina, and a lone blown ranger
Welcome to the world I rock
Doing what in the cut, while niggaz know not
Grand theft, awaited with baited breath
Hear witnesses fear just as clear as death
In the twinklin of an eye, in the ways of the samurai
It's do or die, for the devil's pie
Now I'm phat broad down, received from mo' high
So beautiful it make you want to cry, cry, cry

In the streets they hear it, some will remember the lyrics
In my demise, some will remember me in spirit
And I ain't tryin to die like 'Pac and BIG
And lose my talent to a cultured thug life

Damn, he wildin in the back cab rap

Through the upholstery, even through your mom's groceries

I'm still stitchin motherfuckers up
I deal with high sciences, supreme refinements
Till any wicked germ is destoryed and burned
We the Gods without question
Prove what I'm manifestin, all show ways and actions
Hopeful that, lick your cannon
I'm ill when I shoot to peal like Ed O'Bannon
In my head is a thought, perm cocked, off safety
Shots fired, follow blood trails to the stairwell
Faced down, he lay sound, rounds to his crown
Shorty hip flock was midtown, big fly holdin him down
With the dead-arm, siren sounds
Bullets chip brick, precincts followed by the ambulance
Respond to the bomb threat
I picked up his MC tray through the masters
I'm sharper than my carpentry blade

Challenge instead of grace

Ever since my Birth (no one there!)
I've had no one to care (worried all I know... yeah!)

They say wisdom, is the wise words spoken
By a brother attemptin' to open
The graves, of these mentally dead slaves
Who've been lost on a cross, for decades
And centuries, lookin' for the liberty
But receive nothin', but misery
And hard times, and things of that nature
By the devil in a genocide caper
Little Boy Peep, has lost his sheep
But I found 'em, in a deep long sleep
Nine thousand miles away from home
Livin' the life of a modern-day Flintstone
We the people, supposed to be equal
But the men who wrote that, they was evil
Slave owners, who did not include us
They just used us, and abused us
First they trick you, then mentally kill you
And use technologies, to rebuild you
This whole plan was a perfect scam
See that's why they called it, the Six Million Dollar Man
Six is the limitation of the Devil
In the Million square miles of land that he settles
Put you in a three piece suit, give you loot
Chemicals in your head to make you look cute
They use you as a fool to deceive your own people
And fillin' my children head with pins and needles
But I'll take out the pins you inserted
And I'll avenge all my mothers that you murdered
And brutalized, by this modern form of slavery
To speak the truth it takes bravery
And no man could stop my flow
Because I know what I speak and I speak what I know

What, becomes of a broken family?
Dreams are crushed and there's no more family

[Chorus: x2]

Yo, as a life can be slowed down 20 frames per second
Seen through Panavision
The inner light inside my mind's shines expands the prism
A man of wisdom, victorious and the glorious
Sight beyond sight we stand up as Divine Warriors
Who smite with the mighty right hand of God
Yield the holy sword, swings the holy rod
Then bathe in the pond of Nirvana, escape the realm of Karma
Allow the true grace of God to shine through my persona
And build the reconstructional terms that's constructive
As we destroy the negative germs that's destructive
Productively, sincerely, we uphold the righteous banner
With the gold touch of Midas, mold the righteous hammer
And anvil, to the sound of Man-drill
Ignite to the speed of light cause time to stand still
Rewrite the script of Egypt, who made the Holy Bible
Or Koran, how long ago, who made the Holy Title?
Of I Self Lord And Master, who control the vital
Parts of your heart, who wrote the wise recitals?

Still puzzled like the jigsaw

Heading to the Western Hemisphere, non-stoppin'

Now shit's gettin' deep, you should've thought a lot deeper
It's my time to get over and I got on my blinker
So I write and I spit on the mic, so you can feel
what is truth, what is right and what's not
Yo I must kill the ideal and enlight this Earth
and yo I will give birth to a light that lives to keep it real
All through research, I learned in schools, not even Church
Can instill, these words are jewels so you can heal
Still I search, and I works real hard, I need a deal
and with speed 'caise it hurts indeed

all real and the pastor's best and I always will, do my thing

Strapped down, I'd still get my point across

You debate whether big, whether small
Whether short, whether tall
Whether dense, whether length
Whether strength, whether width
Either man, animal, bird or fish
Whether, black or white, more shapes than snowflakes
Existin', everywhere but you still can't locate
The man of steel couldn't bend me

In the scale of justice and my heart remains balanced and neutral
My respect for all men is mutual
As my thoughts surpass a level to which you devils compute to
You've been given the chance to hear the true and living
So do the knowledge, son, before you do the wisdom
So you can understand, how the thunder and
Lighting above your head is caused by the Son of Man
We experimentin' with high explosions
That cause the place to quake and the surface erosions
The earth produce lava like the mouth produce saliva
This wisdom goes deeper than your scuba diver
In search for the pearl jewels sold to Tiffany
My verbal heart symphony will strike the epiphany
Insight, ignite, and then men might, see love and hell
Hell and right, then excel, to be masters of your circumference
First, by obtainin' mastery of your common sense
This supreme wisdom clears a man's vision
You can see it through the lies and the fantism
Of the equivocal, two-faced political individual
Who's only out for residual, fabricatin' lies
To eradicate the wise
But we come to civilize and gravitate to the skies
Of the heavenly celestial sphere
Trust me, son, it's dear, in between your ears

A day to God is a thousand years
Men walk around with a thousand fears
The true joy of love bring a thousand tears
In the world of desire, there's a thousand snares

Oh sweet joy!
A brand new baby boy

My mind flashed back to the early moon
When I was just a sperm cell in the fallopian tube
In the mist of a state of triple darkness
Going through a struggle so I could exist
Avoiding everything that came within my path
As I watch other sperm cells get ripped in half
One out of a million completes the job
And for the other sperm cells the womb is a grave yard
Though my travels I had to pass through
a lot of battles and violent hassles
Cause inside the womb I was a foreign object
I'm like a new nigga walking through the project
Trouble, everywhere I turn
Damn its a struggle just being a sperm
cell, so I attempt to prevail
I guess the womb is the first stage of hell
Now here I am in the danger zone
My head and my tail, my 23 chromosomes
But then again yo it can't be that bad cause my dad
He could have used a body bag
And if so then my tomb would have been the trash can inside my moms bedroom
But they was fucking, they was true to this
And here I go on a mission to the uterus
A million mother fuckers tried to race ahead
But I was the one that fertilized the egg
Then I thought then I was safe
Because I reached home base
But oh no my job wasn't done
In fact my troubles had only begun life as a struggle
Life is the struggle
Life is the struggle

See the joy of life beginning

The bass shake in the club like it's earthquakin'
I cock arm, pass the bomb, like Troy Aikman (Aikman)
Play the basement like Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson
You miserable, you get kidnapped by Kathy Bason
Thrown to the dungeon, for your spongin'
Of Wu Killa Bee, what's your total malfunction?

We pop, we brawl, get money til the day we fall (yeah)
My glock (my glock), my four (my four)
throw shots through your bedroom door (bedroom door)
From the P's, to the morgue, cop Louie all the way to my drawers (New York)
We pop (pop), we brawl (brawl), get money til the way we fall

Come on, let's cut the crap, money
I've been gettin' this rap money
Crack money, stack money, I'm tryin' to get that Shaq money
That Mike Tyson, Michael Jordan, Michael Jack' money
Five hundred mill' and better, dog, yeah, now that's money
Act funny, ya'll make me laugh (haha)
Frontin' like you tough, you softer than a baby's ass
These lazy ass labels -- fuck you! Pay me cash
My crazy path promoted me into a Mercedes class

We pop, we brawl, get money til the day we fall (yeah)
My glock (my glock), my four (my four)
throw shots through your bedroom door (bedroom door)
From the P's, to the morgue, cop Louie all the way to my drawers (New York)
We pop (pop), we brawl (brawl), get money til the way we fall

Yeah, all ya'll can see is the back of my jersey
Blowin' in the wind, goin' back to Jersey
Off to Brooklyn, left you back in Jersey
I was doin' a buck 90 like a throwback jersey
Shame on a Nigga, take it back to Dirty
Run, game on a nigga, I'll be back in thirty
Seconds, got the world's greatest record
And that money I'mma spend it like your greatest record
This Division, all the ladies respect it
Disrespect it and the eighty'll check it
It ain't hard to see how ya'll ignorin' the steel
Niggas that I clap, lookin' for me still
Til they look like they came out of George Foreman grill
Thoughts are stolen on Free, must be on them crills
Plus my, team gon' be holdin' like forty mill'
Thoughts are rollin' on E., must be on those pills

We pop, we brawl, get money til the day we fall (yeah)

We still in the hood with this one, ya'll
Yeah, from the projects, slums, Fort Greene
Huh? Ain't no sun outside, never sunny where I'm from
Always grimy, yo, yo, yo, yo

Everyday is a struggle, but you can catch my team hustlin' to the late night
Takin' risks, playin' dice, screamin' ""We hate life!""
Gettin' this money, but we want more
I see a lot of niggas beefin', but they don't want war
I heat targets, anything you sese, rob it, got beef like the meat market
I'm clappin' captains, lieutenants, and police sergeants
I got two hoes named Denise and Margaret
They come through and finish drama after we start it
All my chicks major, I rep N.Y. like a Knick player
Get paper, split haters, I still spit and shit razors
Got eight pair of sick 'gators, five watches
Switch flavors, 50 red and blue rocks around the wrist, player
My vision is deep the Division will creep
Run up on you, start hittin' your peeps
Nigga, we ain't playin, our mission's discreet
I'm clippin' your peeps, have you missin' for weeks
To let you know we ain't playin'

Olive oil and fried tomatoes and basil
I stepped in flared nasal from Hazelnut Amaretto
My watch 80 G appraisal
Plus they drop 50 G's for a RZA beat
Cherry wood, hid the receipts, presidential suites
Ice cold bottles of Cristy 'til my eyes misty
Complainin' to my lawyer how this rookie tried to frisk me
Jealous of my jeep, I gave his badge to the chief
And got his ass directin' traffic in the heat for a week

Keep comin' out your gums like loose teeth
You gonna take a 40 to the mouth and it ain't no brewski
That monitor gonna show straight lines like looseleaf
Got Up North niggas straight out the box like Lucies
Wanna shoot me? know you get a kick out of that just like Bruce Lee
Ya'll don't wanna lose teeth
Comin' all out of your face just like pimples
That thing comin' out of my waist, gotta hit you
'cause ya'll niggas ain't with it, better quit it
'Til you catch one through that man dribblin' on your fitted
That mean one through the front, through the back of the cap
Like the great Pun packin' a Mac in the back of the Ac'
You could take one, not talkin' bout a Ac'
I get cake from the fat crack bag with them packs, what?

Yo, I beat the case, now I face the acquittal 
You nizzles try to belittle, but ya'll lest in spittle 
From a baby's lip, the digi made me flip 
Plus they paid me chips, just to spray the clip 
And empty out on you, in sync like the SMPTE output on the MPC 2002 
We be housin' crews, plus we housin' fools 
In abandoned apartments with a thousand tools 
Crazy shootin' dudes buck off the beat 
Brainless boutless fools who be stuck off the leaf 
Two guns in their hands yellin' ""Fuck the police!"" 
On the weekend get drunk and they fuck with the niece 
Of the precint chief, she got the tattoo 
On her breast that's shaped like The W 
Go 'head snatch the guns, son, I'll cover you 
And if they get past me we got another two, yeah... 

[Chorus: RZA & Prodigal Sunn] 
We smoke those blunts the size of bats 
We got those gats as long as ax 
We snatch that cheese right off the trap 
We put those Beez all on your map

I shoot the fair one, I dare ya'll run through New York City 
Or any city or place, my face, royal taste, pace myself 
Ace my health, great with wealth 
Undetected like the wings of a Stealth, I move for self 
Or any man, woman or child that I call fam 
That's the way I am, word to Glock, my sister Pam 
Son, lived through the terror of the World Trade blues 
Nine o'clock news, abused the mind of many fools 
Braves and jewels, made my moves, paid my dues 
From the School of Intelligence, I stayed benevolent 
Most high, magnify, multiply, as I add to the Kings of Kings 
We never die, built my name, sustained like blood 
Flow through the veins divine sign 
Dine with wine forever sunshine 

[Chorus] 
[RZA] 
We smoke... 

[Masta Killa] 
From the Vil to Brazil, live on your see-SPAN radio band 
Explicit, dice kiss it, pour a little liquor 
Golden imported from Cuba, Miss Aruba 
Sexy as Asia, met her up in Mecca 
Getting up in Just Cipher, hit it on the first date 
Plotted my escape, twelve hours shift at the gate 
How can you beat a G a week in '88? 
Trips to the Pocono Lodge, the fresh Izod 
Mama shouldn't work so hard to pay the landlord 
A grand in your birthday card, times is hard 
The gun hammer click, when the pigs blitz 
We scramble like Vick, automatic six plus one to the head 
Yo, the east so hot, it's red, but that's home 
And my Glock still burn your skin to the bone 
Sonny Corleone don't discuss it on the phone

I love you like how the Park Hill cats love to pull metal
The heat will make ya head whistle loud like a full kettle
I come like the Mecca in civilizin
The hallway jackal, Chicago Bull bandana
I keep police scanners from fishes
They try to slash me out like Douton Hanna
And blow my spot, yo, I'm not the polka-dot
I tote weight, sip Scotch, bust shots, smoke a lot
My cousin Billy, he done it silly, used to joke a lot
Chased bitches, cut class, got high and stayed broke a lot
So when the rent was due he would grab the identical
Twin gats and put a fuckin hole in your right ventricle
Not sober yet no potent threat, yo, I hold a Tec
Show this jet pack on my back, blast like no respect
While you bickerin, this flame is still flickerin
Then the magnetic attraction to my wisdom keeps you listenin

Be the haunting, dauntin, brothers won't fuck
with The Wu-Tang swordsman, slowly get dropped
When my Shaolin sword, swing at Nasty Immigrants with passports
To teach Man, Woman and Child, with the sword style
God, complete the presence
It only takes seconds to chop a nigga head on RZA records
But you a worthless effort, follow faster then leopards
I can't wait to return to the fuckin essence
Of hip-hop, yo, my shit chop constantly
It's over when my shit drops, son, honestly
I love the RZA and the whole Wu Academy
For givin me a chance to be what I want to be (What?)
But You will Never Know how much..

Come on my nigga.. Listen yo..
Do you think this black mic will cock back, jam or choke?
I should stick a long silver hook down your throat
And snatch out your vocal, bitch my eyes is black opal
Reflectin this 2.2 kilogram Mac that smoke you
Firin lightnin, Northern Lights, duck tight and chocolate Philly
Lyrics pierce through the ear like the spear of Achilles
Iron body Bobby Digital suit, don't bother to shoot
Quicker than Clint when I draw the six shoo'
Mortal Kombat whether it's the blind or the mute
Cripple a idiot, dunn, it sounds ridiculous
Rapid flow got you petro, my voice echo, echoes
Off the Wall Street money we stack like golden geckos
Gecko, gecko, let go my Eggo or feel my Eagle
4,5,6 in my hand, I've rolled the see-lo
Brother knocked the long pound, ounces or straight kilos
You know how we go, it's the Killa Bee show
Then I love you like how the Pharaoh loves Joseph
The jewelry of Moses, like a man bendin down on one knee before he proposes
The special 8, laid the hammer, about to slay Isaac
and the paitence of Daniel in the lion's den with closed eye lids

You know they say
In every man's life, there comes a time
When you get struck by the arrow of cupid
By the love of God, or the beauty of a woman
Sometimes this love, brings thunder into your life
And it brings the storm, sing about it

[Xavier Naidoo]
There was once a love in this
Love is more than just a kiss
Will we take you to that step
Will we do more than just connect
And will you, bring the thunder in my life
And the fire in my eyes
Cause then there, will be days of pleasure when
Everything far will be so near

[Hook: Xavier Naidoo (woman)]
I have never felt thunder (thunder)
And lighting (lightning) like this
I have never been struck by (struck by)
A wonder (a wonder) like this

[Xavier Naidoo]
There aren't days where I can, stop talking about you
There aren't days I can't stop, saying your name
And I'm looking for ways in never, to part from you, ha-ha
And everything change and you, still stayed the same

[Chorus: x 4]
I've never seen, and there's never been
Anything, with the beauty of you

[RZA]
Yo, yo, yo
Aiyo, shorty, I've never met someone so beautiful
From your hair follicle to your finger nail cuticle
Struck by the arrow of cupid, this love is deep rooted
Like someone, took my heart sampled it and looped it
To a song that's endless, passion brings the tempest
I'll slay a thousand dragons to save my little princess
A walking gift from God, you are my shining star
The diamonds and gold that most men be mining for

[Xavier Naidoo]
Days that we shared our light treasures
The treasure light fire is to mankind
My hands will try to carry you to heaven
But since I've seen you, you've brought heaven to my mind

Prevent that, find ya self in a tight squeeze now

It's all about see's now, too many MC's now
Please now listen, I'm takin somebodys place
Fuck who that be, ya'all cats can't hold it like me
Though I'm not from no famous, borough or state
I've spent years in this shit, more than eight
I'm more than great, I cross more borders than weight
I serve you 24/7, ya'all can order this shit late
And choose the language too, just go ahead
You want norwegian or the spanish row instead
Toma, para los que pueren entender (Spanish)
Til de som stÃ¥r og ler, vi fÃ¥r bent dem ner (norwegian)

I don't know if ya know this, but ya facts are twist
Up and coming motherfuckers just act as if
What they need to learn about is what practice is
Ya'all should get a teacher, who you lack is Chris
It be funny to see how you react to this
I'm like that +Activist+, I run up with bombs
While screamin 'fuck rap', with see-4 in both palms
I keep spittin after I blew off both arms
RZA came through, I'm used to flow over tarms
Beef that is, I'm tryin to reach these kids
Go head to head with these labels, beat their bids
Do whatever it taes, I never shit slide
Bout to switch on they ass like Jekyll to Hyde
Nobody takes me for a ride, put it to side
That's not an option, time for me to go outside
Hard to knock loose, cool with that much pride
God's my witness, I don't got too much to hide
That wasent the truth, Virgin Mary would I cry?
Peeped it with closed gates and I've would've fried

We like to get, get high
Smoke, smoke, lah, lah
Trees, and feel the breeze
Y'all can't fuck with this cat from the northeren sea

I might, get my, my big, big G-A-T
And start the squeeze, 16 shots at you crab MC'z

Nigga, we can get high, high
Chase ????, chop
Ski, feel the breeze
Y'all can't fuck with this cat from the northeren sea

I might get, get my, my big

A real fighter, maybe there's a young Sly in me
I'm like that Spanish Rocky, attitude a bit cocky
Me around ya girl, y'all could guess where that cock be
Well it's not in my pants, not in my hands

Un sac de croix sur l'dos j'affronte
Ces foudres prêt à en découdre
Tout blanc vêtu, moi le sale noir, l'esprit nue
Seul sur le ring sous le sol spacial, entends la cloche fatale
Quand les anges ont la dale, see'est mieux qu'un blanc qui sale

Ca fait un bail que j'danse avec l'espoir
Faut que j'sorte do bétail où j'traine ma vie animale
Outre les raisons, seul dans les choix et actions
Et trop de souvenirs en tête, est-je pris les bonnes décisions?
See'est dans la pulsion souvent qu'jai choisi la friction

Mais bon Franchement ya des cons sur

Et tout ce que j'aurais pu dire et faire, ouais je sais j'espère
Veinement qu'les impairs why'a que moi qui va devoir les payer

Et j'ai bien essayer, tu peux me rayer d'ta liste si ça t'plais
Et si tu laisses en fait les mêmes parfaits
Ton peuple il va faire les jetés
Ni l'moins bon, ni l'meilleur vécu à cent à l'heure

Devant la question éternelle d'lhomme Qui nous sommes?
Dis leur qu'on est le peuple d'celui qui a croqué la pomme

Au delà d'l'univers et ca le monde le sait
Là où la vie est cadenassée, Père

Allah be the maker
Bow down to your creator

Tout seul face à lui
Put your wicked heart on the scale
You melt like a snow flake in hell

Seul face à lui
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
No disgiue, no alibis and no lies
Tout seul face à lui
You realize every breath you took
It came from the most High

Ma première clope, j'lai fumé en traitre
D'une traite, dans une punèbre
J'ai même pas aimé, quelle merde
Pourquoi j'lai fais? je l'ignore

Faut qu'ca serve comme être célèbre
Putain, tu crois pas que see'tait mieux être bon élève?
Avec une crève deux ans dans les dortoirs
Premier coeur j'crèvre

Histoire comme les autres, brève
Debout dans les piqués de grève
À cette époque ma mère vit ses rêves
Le syndicat est puissant et à la une des prèves
Et après quoi? Ils se sont tous taillés comme des lâches
Se sont couvert de la misère dans les flashs

Maman are'viens sur Terre
Ici merde see'est chacun sa ganache
Excuses moi pour ma scolarité à l'arrache
Accroches mon coeur dans l'cadre
Et mon are'gard sévère s'évade

Comme Jules se tire dans le back dans monade et sérade
La vie see'est grave me laisse indifférent, maintenant cest grave
Dans un arbre prosse l'ail nos initiales s'gravent
Mes amours, see'est ma main que j'tends
Attrapez la sans dire non, on perd déjà trop d'temps

On joue tous les mêmes scènes, les mêmes peines
Restez fort quand les difficultés d'te voir caller
Crie ou implore
See'est comme un implant qui tient l'bon chemin de haut
Alors que rien se tient, seul l'instein pousse nos limites

Excuse, why'en a pas mal qui imite
Chacun son sort, chacun ses rites
Chacun sa cause, fuck les antisémites
Je dois rien à personne à part au Seigneur
Et see'qu'il emporte, faut l'gérer

Chaque cellule grise part pas
Mais pour être jugé dans c'monde
Pourtant j'rêve de liberté dans c'monde
Ceux qui dirigent, see'est la minorité
Les femmes qui aiment faire ce spécial
Pour les deux pour, crient trop
Là-bas why'aura pas d'blancs ni d'negros

Caro RZA qui la storia è tesa
Potersi esprimere sta diventando un'impresa, o meglio
Poterlo fare liberi da vincoli politici
Senza assecondare orrendi gusti estetici

Appena fuori standard ti senti solo dire
Di essere troppo all'avanguardia e quindi incollocabile
Fuori tempo minimo per essere comprensibile
Condannato alla gavetta eterna a raccattare briciole

Per semplice che sia RZA mio, credimi
Sono anni che va avanti questo gioco degli screditi
Dei titoli assegnati senza meriti
Da chi il fischio d'arbitro la vinto ad una lottery

Troppi incompetenti nelle posizioni cardine
Troppe le barriere che si alzano ad un ordine
Troppi quei sorrisi a mascherare I modi barbari
Troppe le energie necessarie ad esser liberi

Prima che I teppisti dell'estetica
Istigati dall'istinto
Si insinuano negli intestini
Artistici di direttori stitici
Avanzano con moti di rivolta peristaltici

Risalgono alla volta dello stomaco
Altamente indigeribili si insediano
Aprendo ulcere profonde come gole
Urlandoci parole fino a farle traboccare

Volando in un conato salvatore
A metà della riunione
Ma dimmi, ti pare giusto RZA?
Che si debba fare questa cosa
Ogni volta che uno si riposa?
Dopo aver provato a dare il meglio

Dopo avere fatto un altro figlio
Vederselo strappare da chirurghi
Dilettanti allo sbaraglio
Che se commettono uno sbaglio capita
Fanno una modifica e il tempo si decapita
Non versano una lacrima, bacio all'anima
Avanti il prossimo

RZA,"You ain't sayin' nothing slick to a can of oil
Tell your man to tell his man that his man's a girl
I holds weight, y'all niggas skinny like Olive Oil
We throws at least half a ki' in the pot to boil
Royal niggas, rags to riches
Because your boy breaks bitches like glasses, dishes
Burn money like I put it in some grass and spliffed it
If I don't get my man that's passed, it's not misses
Female donkeys, y'all niggas ass and dickless
Hard white rap, just some foil like Chiclets
Never had a wife, you better settle for the mistress
The truth like Al Capone dying from the syphlis
Cross me, your name flying on the hit list
Y'all niggas buck, won't even pop a clutch on the gear shift
That ain't the hard pose, nigga, you just scared stiff
I'm on my grizzly, you might walk right into bear shit
You rock your pants too tight, get off that queer shit
No turning back when it's on, I ain't trynna hear shit
Like the coast guard, I got them choppers than can airlift

Sword, don't you know what you bring?
You destroy everything, all the blood that you give to men
There's, no excuse I could give, we just all want to live
All the war that you bring to men
War, is comin' home, takes families
War, I'm not a great big fan of it
War, is something that is scandalous
Oh no, oh no
War, is comin' by air, land and sea
War, is man's insanity
This world, for sure...
Must stop, this world of war

Tell ya fake niggas don't get me involved, my back is chunky
Four-five hanging out the jeans, is crunchy
Facial hair beard, looking like Abe Lincoln
Stand next to you and my jewels look like ya cage is shrinking
Love sweets like a dope fiend, nodder with fat hands
Keep birds around me, they be calling me Batman
Precisely I pop like cheap luggage, prefusely bleeding
Word on the streets is you lost three buckets
Fuck it, you keep dying, I'm into red diamonds
Rob me, bitch, I have your whole hood crying
Lighting candles on the street like, ""why you trying?""
Oh Lord, why you had to lullabye him
His jewels is cursed, his seeds is first
When he do shows, he pop a wheelie off his merch'
6'3, medium built, tall like Lurch
While y'all faggots be sleep, he be putting in work

That's his absorbance stance, I got it down to a glance
It's war, I got the biggest gun down my pants, pants
Got a rock, rocket in my pocket
For to knock ya head right out the socket
Turn teardrops to smile, been graced this spare child
Spray a gallon of mace in your face, burn off your 'brows
No phone home, you dribbling, we stone ya sibling
Get my bloods from Tilden, to burn your building
Poison tip dagger sword, chop through your collar bone
No, you don't got a fucking chance to holler home
Nice dream, your sliced spleen, cut through your ice bling
G-O-D, heats, melts you like it's ice cream
I'm not vanilla, I'm Black Panther chinchilla
My cousin's an orangutan, my brother's a gorilla
The other's a ape, he turn a rainbow straight
Get you trapped in the jungle now you can't escape
War it is, that's the biz, glock pop, plops the feds
Split your wig, crack your whip, smack your wiz, blast your 'quip
Chains and whips, planes and ships, guns, swords and flip stones
And bricks, munch, clothes and kicks, you know it's

Sword, don't you know what you bring?
You destroy everything, all the blood that you give to men
There's, no excuse I could give, we just all want to live

Keep a super suit like I’m incredible

Handcuff the judge, and throw the cops in jail
Make the meanest woman break down and cry

Say my name three times, and you knock on wood
Candy man walks, I terrorize your hood
Flashing macs on a cop, the way a gangster should
I snatch food from the mouth of a tiger
Take a gasoline bath, and I walk through fire
Bear hug a grizzly, suck milk from her titty
Take the sergeant hat from his head and use it for a Frisbee
Spit in a crocodiles face, have a menage a trois with two female apes
Then sleep in a barrel of butcher knives
I drink honey straight from the beehive
Bungee jumping off the Empire State butt-naked
Rollerblade across the Golden Gate, butt-naked
I’m the baddest man alive, and I don’t ṗlan to die
When the grim reaper come, I look him right in his eye
I bust off in the face of the witch of the East
Tell a great white shark to go and brush his teeth, heh heh heh
I’m the man who stole the golden fleece
And I date rape Beauty right in front of the Beast

S,"Down from the glen came the marching men
With their shields and their swords
To fight the fight they believed to be right
To overthrow the overlords.

To the towns where there was plenty
They brought plunder, swords and flame
When they left the town was empty
And the children would never play again.

From the graves I heard the fallen
Above the battle cry
By the bridge near the border
There were many born to die

Then onward over the mountain
And outward toward the sea
They come to claim the Emerald
Without it they could not leave.",Emerald

Will you miss those arms that used to go

In the dark

Will soothe, so close your weary eyes

If we were trapped in an elevator after the earthquake
Five stories under debris
You and me in the garden indefinitely

After 10 hours were thinking about food
We lost our voices from shouting, and screaming 
And crying and singing and being really crude
My tummy rumbles but theres' no guitar so we have sex instead and we go so far
And we do that for days til we're knee deep in cum
Dehydrated , exhausted, insane aquarium

 Get your ass on over here and show me,
 Stop wasting time,
 And if you need me to get your act together boy,
 And show me,
 You should be mine.

 Is it me or you?

 That our love was to last all time.

 The happy with the sad,
 But don't get mad if things
 Don't got the way you planned.
 Just understand that real love is in demand.
 If you're ready for commitment girl just take my hand.
 If you get lucky, love will be a cruise.
 There are so many roads,
 Which one you gonna choose.
 But there's a rish you know you've gotta take,
 No messing, a choice you gotta make.
 The one cross you know you've gotta bear,
 All in love is fair.

Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed

With her I feel at home and even when we're apart it's
Strange but I can feel her presence beside me
So in a sense one could say that she guides me
Now I'm remembering the first time I saw her

Impossible to measure it, one can only treasure it
Sort of like a legacy, maybe it's my destiny
Maybe it's a test of me, to bring out the best in me
Who knows, who cares, all I know is that there's
A reason for everything and whatever fate may bring
See I didn't plan this some don't understand this
They try to play the role of thinking that's what a man is
To me she's more than just a fashion accessory

S Club 7,"I still think about how it used to be
So entwined in my own lies
Surrounded by this make believe
I've been held by despondency
I should have known the road I chose
Would run out on me, oh no

I could've faded, been jaded
By every consequence
Every word that you hurdled
Was part of my defense
You can hurt me, desert me
It makes no difference
I give as good as I get

Like a weight falling from my shoulders
I'm not going to go that way again
(Never going back)
When everybody said that my days were over
Wouldn't get the time to comprehend
(You should've known that)

You should've known it would make me stronger
I was never gonna fade away
(Don't you know that)
I keep it coming, my destiny ain't running away from me
And it's all so bittersweet

In my life, I had no room for compromise
The things I've done have been
The ones I have had to leave behind
Look in my eyes, you barely recognize
The woman who depended on you
To sing a little praise or criticize, oh no

So I hide it, divide it
'Bout what I feel inside
Now I take it or make it
I'm gonna be alright
Whether you need me, believe me
You'll never hurt my pride
Finally all this feels like

Like a weight falling from my shoulders
I'm not going to go that way again

Wouldn't get the time to comprehend

I keep it coming, my destiny ain't running away from me
And it's all so bittersweet

Look into my eyes, I won't be left behind
Every thing's going to be fine
And I have never felt like this
I have no need to reminisce
Those old days have gone
And I keep holding on

Like a weight falling from my shoulders
I'm not going to go that way again
(Never going back)
When everybody said that my days were over
Wouldn't get the time to comprehend

A corner of my head
You're the tainted mirror Image
That my heart has to reject

So I've gotta keep my distance
When you tell me you can change
You can't burn me with
The heat of your love
'cause I've put it in the shade

Nothing you can do can phase me
Since I got my wake up call
You can't do your damage like before

Too little to Late Girl
Didn't know what you had till it's gone (Don't Tell me your sorry now)
Too little to Late Girl
Can't get back what's already lost
Now Your Alone
 
Can't turn back the clock
Can't make momentum stop
And every time I look at you and hesitate
I get a trigger in my mind
That makes me rewind
And remember how you blew my heart away

Didn't know what you had till it's gone, So gone

See things in black and white

Like I never ever loved no one before you
Pretty pretty boy of mine
Just tell me you love me too
Oh my pretty pretty boy I need you
Oh my pretty pretty boy I do
Let me inside
And make me stay right beside you

I used to write your name
And put it in a frame
And sometimes I think I hear you call
Right through my bedroom wall
You stay a little while
And touch me with your smile
And what can I say to make you mine
To reach out for you in time

Oh my pretty pretty boy I love you
Like I never ever loved no one before

Just tell me you love me too

I crawl when I creep, looking for a dime piece
That's down to get knocked down, like porno freaks
I'm just a ghetto superstar, that's trying to climb out the hood
So if you haters thinking jack, I'll bust a round if you would
Try to plot come on my block, my slugs will meet ya
And greet ya, social security will have to delete ya

Leave the murder scene, on my gold and chrome adaptors

It's the Jay'Ton, so you know I don't play
When I bo'gaurd the block, better get out my way
If you fuck up my slab, I'ma fuck up your day
So back-back, before my click get on your ass
And we don't need a mask, for them niggaz talking too fast
In a blue tipping and turning, wrecking 'em while I'm swanging
Call me an O.G., the way my trunk banging
Fuck roaming the club, I'ma knock the top off
And show you how we be stunting, in the Dirty Dirty South
They mouth be wide open, stuck like they wet
I bet, these niggaz gon respect my set

You better get out of dodge, my entourage coming quicker than flash
That's your ass, Slow Loud And Bangin got you feeling like trash
Never need to get in the club, we be crawling the lot
Trunk popped top done dropped, on thirty some'ing dots
Out the roof one hundred proof, on a mission for bops
Yeah they try to get my attention, but the rims don't stop
Entertaining up in my slab, got 'em riding my jock
Throwback ""Fondren & Main"", got 'em doing the wop
See the mind frame is fast, and the wide frame is slow
My game is too fly, my mouthpiece is thoed
Piece and chain, hitting about a hundred below
So when it get hot I'm garunteed, to be pulling a hoe
Whether in a silver bullet, or in a Excursion
They need a anthem for the streets, and this is my version
Slow Loud And Bangin is what I'm yelling, when I be swerving
And I can show you what it do, when I hop on the curb and

I find myself in a daze, sitting watching time fly on by
I tried to catch a grip, but somehow we keep moving on by
We came a long way, from playing hide-and-seek on the block
To bleeding corners on the daily, barely missing the cops
We turned to grown men, quicker than the blink of an eye
Some of us made it some of us didn't, but still we got by
What about the good times, ain't too many but I remember
Stadium Bowl, the rest of the clubs wouldn't let us in 'em
We was young, and plus our pants sag like Dubs
But we ain't care, cause half of the parking lot knew who we was
We came from riding on a bike, and graduated to a Houpe
Six deep with a grey cassette, trying to swang banging Screw
That was the days, but now we only riding with guns
Only understanding I got, is multiplying my funds
And moving slow in a drop, pass bops so grimey
Missing better days, hoping they could come and find me

[Hook]
I remember, being kids on the block
Pennies and my nickels, soon turned to a knot
I went from playing tag, to me running from the cops
Went from Tunker Toys, me swanging in a drop
Flying pass bops
I remember, being kids on the block
Pennies and my nickels, soon turned to a knot
I went from shooting water, to me loading up a glock
I came from the gutter, trying to make it to the top
Shit don't stop

[Jay'Ton]
I remember kicking it, with my niggaz in Middle School
In the hall full time, fuck class and all the rules
Late night, I was with the O.G.'s on the block
Curfew broke, but I was trying to stack me a knot
With my nigga Raw-C, Nick and the T-Head
Can't forget about the J2, and blocks we bled
Playing tackle football, while we on the concrete
In the house, imitating everybody we can beat
From the West to the North, with my nigga Pyrex
On the hunt for some bops, roaming through the projects
When I turned 16, Trae bought me a car
Four 15's, so the hood know who we are
Jay walking, so you know I'm walking it fly
T-shirt creased up, fuck a suit and a tie
Them was the days, I'll probably never see him again
So my main focus now, is for me stacking my ends

[Boss]
I was raised back in the 80's, I can tell ya bout the Smurfs
We was kids, we done traded our nurse for hard work
I can go back in the day, to playing get like me
In the hood looking for trouble, can you hit like me
I was a youngster in the street life, bailing through the street lights
First pair of G-Nike's, ask a nigga what that G like
I remember playing curve ball, and soccer
They got most of my homies chained up, in 5-by-7 lockers
The days ain't the same, in '79
Nigga was cool in '94, but now everybody walk in a shady line
25 years of keeping it real, wasn't hard for me
Living for the moment, to hit the gates for the Lord to see

[Z-Ro]
I done came a long way, from cutting class
No more ducking hall monitors, now the FED's on my ass
Grown man shit Joseph Wayne McVey, I never thought I would say
That a state jail or prison, is a place I'd have to stay
I remember Saturday morning, cartoons and basketball
Half of the niggaz I was hooping with, in a casket y'all
The streets, is a graveyard
187's every second, please watch over my days Lord
I'm nothing but a Christian, I'm down with Jehovah
But this day in time, you ain't gon make it if you ain't a soldier
So God forgive me because I'm strapped, somebody might try to do me
The real world ain't like my block, this shit it like a movie
Make me wanna travel back in time, like Michael J. Fox
To when all my people was living, and it was love on the block
But ain't nothing but the future, bout to take place
It'll never be 1989 again, so nigga fuck friends

Saafir,"I've been down this corridor -
Before you enter you have to bring
Back the creator of winter damn,
Too late I'm spoiled, I need the napalm
I got it, I shot it in my left sector,
Blew up the timing device on the reactor.
Time shifted I had to remold the floor
The foundation for creation - mate's blend
The pleasure dome into another roam -
A walk stalked nightly by the ogre
That's rarely sober. but there's no tracin
I see the place in the flow. I'm beyond dawn,
No I'm not in the lawn under pawns -
Don't rest, never possessed stagnate magnets.
I never pulled slits lips wit no braille skilled eyes -
Balls through eyesockets. I'm currently current
Currents of electricity; they can't get wit me
Invisible to the retina half - way reality part limbo.
A nervous laugh while ya climbin through windows,
Never spin ho's on merry-go-rounds,
Be the ground level for ghouls, schools of fish,
Victims on a hit list me like geronimo on a pratt -
Tackle patt tacklin patterns addin in seasonings, flavor.
No false teeth for beef, catapulting fingers to light
Switches so you can see the real, I feel the tension
My sight twitches - I'm bent.

Second scene: I'm the star in a step show
Around corners, the coroner's office;
Where my rep grows. I'm on some sort of drug
Like the president, it's evident that I'm noid,
A little bit of pizza - the riddle gets deeper.
I'm lookin for outs n ins, stolen isotonas,
The gloves, the bout begins three jabs on a transport
It's a sport for me to take another life on landing,
Branding wit a prattle prod designed by god.
It's my job to resign frauds,
The odd is against you got a degree in me,
So I know that I flow, credentials are essential -
It's blasphemy the type of shit they be askin me.
I don't feel the vibe, abstract art the veal
Doesn't heal this deprived stomach from a plummet.
Swinging on a duet with the bullet.
I never pull out for suspense - I'm on a bent mission.

Jack cousteau couldn't take it no deeper -
I'm a resident in davey jones micro-locker
Holds the phone, foamin at the mouth:
Mad dog, a taste, never had hog I'm droppin
The scrooge, makin fools hit the log - axe it.
I seen it beneath where the cowards hope
Trembled sleeper see if you can find the lost
Treasure through measures in bars - I'm bent.

Saafir,"Intro:
Yo Saafir what's goin' on playboy? 
Saafir: What's really goin' on? 

Huh, you tell me baby. 

Saafir:Hey, it's like this man. 
I gotta let these motherfuckers know how to crawl man. 

I know everybody tryin' to come up immediately. 

Saafir:You know they don't got the motherfuckin' perseverance cause they 
ain't have it hold up though. I gotta go and do this man.

Verse 1:
You can hear the ambition mobbin' in my po position
The intention is to come up 
Do your grindin' pay the boss before you floss
And don't lose your mind and find discipline' 
And stackin' your scratch 
So it don't come up missin' in
As you're askin' the Lord for guidance
While you ridin' 
Stickin' and movin' slidin' 
In and out the game
Unless you realize you're sprung before you legalize your funds
All you track hustlers that was made for the corner 
Dodgin' the coroner's office 
I'm tossin' this at you
Now on some sermon type shit 
I'm burnin' and I gotta write this
The mic got me ballin' 
Shot callin' 
It's the murk one like that 
Sit back but not in starship 
So I don't tarnish or rust 
When I'm bustin' on the next jerk
Who swears he's ballin' but can't network
You better off with sexwork
The way you fucked in the game
It's a shame
I'm aimin' at the bathroom stall on all of y'all
With the H.J.s deflecting these hate rays
Until the sun falls 
You acquired a dream
Crawl before you ball

Hook:      (x2)
What you thought?
You was just gonna ball on the spot?
Let's be real
You gotta stack dollar bills before you get a mil
Gotta handle business before you choose to chill or you fall
Crawl before you ball  

Verse 2:
All you pompous ass marks in Babylon yawnin' 
Becomin' another nigga spawnin'
>From the trenches 
The stench is unknown 
I've been crawlin' like a two toed 
Chameleon for so long 
Writing these songs and ridin' these thongs
With bracelets on they ankle bone
That's anxious to moan 
Like Neena Samone
Have a trick 
Sickin' thinkin' 
That we know it's on 
You better crawl before you ball man
Before you fall man
Keep ya hoes off your payroll
Unless they crawl with you 
And you know they all with you 
And even then they won't fall with you
I'm like fuck 'em
I got to 
It's a new sheriff in town his name is Reggie Mamoo
Ya hear?
More like Saafir
On a crawl 
By watch how daddy ball
I'm all ears and all eyes 
Recognize 
I'm crawlin'

Bridge:      (x2)
Baby baby let me kick my all to y'all
You gotta crawl before you ball
I've seen so many many soldiers fall
They didn't know you had to crawl before you ball

Verse 3:
You see gotta put in major work in at first 
Before you burst
Crawl before you ball but never lose your thirst
When you ballin' 
Or you gonna end up broke and butt naked with no garments on
While I'm makin' more cheese than Parmesian
Learn game at a fast rate
Apply it to my walk then stalk
I won't fall off cause I'm a put in that work
And I'm a stick to that plan 
Now I'm a stay down with my folleys 
The team then turn and brace God gave green
Going, going till I'm gone
I'm ballin'

Hook",Crawl Before You Ball
Saafir,"[Intro:]
Can I talk to why'all for a minute
See the game has become a lil twisted
See you gotta cat like me imma east coast playa
Str8 from up state
Then you got my man Cam he a west coast playa
Then you got my homey saafir..se he a westsiiiiderrr!!
And we get down like dis

[Cam:]
You See I'm standing strong
But still don't want to break no bread
Now why'all gonna think I'm wrong when I start going up side your head
Str8 left you for dead
And that's the reason why
I still be riding on these Niggaz like giddyup horsey ride
I'm on the wind on my saddle
Bout to herd up some cattle
Cut the head of a snake and save the rattle
You willing to battle
Partna but you fail to see you losing the war
I stand up for what I believe in not leaving enough to score
Bet to show that why'all can't ignore my rep for making people shout
Whether popping they ass on stage..or socking they ass on out
I'm like Luke on this money..Dont stop!
Get it Get it..down south they bout it! bout it!
But out west we Widdit Widdit
If you fools admit it
Maybe you wouldn't be on the ground
And everything would be OK I wouldn't have to lay you you down
why'all haters ain't doing me no harm I'm still rich
Just like Old Macdonald on his farm.bia bia ittch!

Chorus:
Niggaz be hating me constantly plotting downfall
But I ain't scared of none of why'all 
Watch how daddy ball 
""I ain't scared of none of why'all watch how daddy ball"" too short (3X)

[Saafir:]
Now watch how daddy ball on all of why'all
While why'all plotting for my downfall
Always gotta watch my back around why'all
When I touch the turf, everybody slow down
Shit is getting worse, 'cause ain't no money in the town
For what its worth, I have to give my hustle a rebirth
Research another circuit, so I can really work it
I'm sick of sending ripples down the stream of ounces
In order to triple my scratch on the scheme of things I'm bouncing'
Outta town to get mined fuck these mousetraps
Niggaz fighting over cheese like rats
My whole family is against me, pullin out gats, what type of shit is that?
You got me strapped with a tight grip, 
when I'm around fools they tight lipped
But want to jaw jack me to death around a tight bitch
I know the script but while you stuck on some town shit
I be ballin nationwide bound bitch!

[Chorus (3X)]
[Saafir:]
One year later with from inflated plan
Just me and my man, touching back down in the town
But in the background, wishing into whispering
He's back! With all the scratch and all the contact
Now what why'all lack contracts mackin the gats (I got that)?
See I'm mobbing with a permanent plan, you say he came up quick (damn)
While you still on the corner standing in quick sand
You think you know what time it is, but your hourglass 
Let the hour pass right by you
Why fool? You should have taken more than an hourglass in high school
Instead of snorting dog coughing wit your tweaking ass
I speak fast, stick a move in and out
Now I'm the man with all the clout
Nothing but big shit, mobbing in big ass whips
Own big ships, floating on big battle ships
Fuck a yacht,I'm trynna own a block like the Jewish
Watch how daddy ball this year Saafir knew it!

Imma tell why'all one more time..listen!
[Chorus (3X)]

Snipers are moving unseen
Fight for land, to lose it again
Shrapnel is filling the air

Hell on earth, the trenches mean death, better keep your head down low
Charge their lines, the ultimate test it's a synchronized sacrifice

Get the wounded after dark
Left alone in no man's land
Maddening chaos at the front

Dream of heaven
Angels are calling your name

Shells and guns, a rifle and scope
Bullets are wearing your name
Losing track of time and of space
Midnight at sanity's edge

Losing friends to artillery shells, at the break of dawn
Break their will, as yours has been broken, they're here alone, dream of home

Scout at night to guard their lines

Serve me Berlin on a plate!

Will I find a way, will I find a place
Will you let me go in peace
Will I find a way to the other side.

Sad are memories from the life I lived
Cannot go on, cannot go further
I has to end right here
For the things that I have done
All the girls I lost and won
Let me rest in peace at last

Will I find a way, will I find a place
Will you let me go in peace
Leave behind those dark days
No I ask again will you hear my cries
Then you realize why oh why
I must find a way to the other side.

Sad to realize to late death was meant to be my fate
All this pain will follow me.

But now you are mine.
Weaving the web that entwines you,

Like a puppet you play on the end
Of your strings 'till the end of
Your days.""
Then fleeing from the terrors

At the night before I leave,
The remenants of reality behind
Me 'neath the trees.
Waking in the light of dawn I

Pray that God will send -
His wisdom now to guide me
Through this night-time without end.
Now I see that this quest isA test of my fidelity-

Lest he find himself within a
Cage of his own making.

The Ways of Wyrd are many and
Our path you must decide,
For the secrets that you seek
Are all around you-

Use your eyes.
The threads cannot be broken
That have brought you here to me -
And bind two foes together
Like the best of enemies.

You gaze upon me -
I can tell what you see,
A simple man -
With simple thoughts and

Simple needs.
Superstition -
Preying on a mind filled with fear,
Opposition-

To all your 'enlightened' ideas.
Yet I will show you more than
You can comprehend,
Beware delusion is a
Dangerous friend.

Ask loaded questions seeking
Knowledge of a faith that
You wish to pervert -
All our values,
With hidden meanings
You try concealing your
Underlying wish to convert -
'heathen' souls,

To a faith that will doubtless
Send our Gods to the grave -
Mistake you're making overlooking
The fact that we might not want
To be 'saved'.

Fear is an old friend of mine,
We have met many times before.
(Drawn to these spirits like
Moths to a flame-
When there is no risk then
There can be no gain).
Death is a harsh fact of life
You cannot avoid or ignore.

The Life-force is as strong in
You as it is strong in me,
The difference is what you

Hold captive I set free.
You seek to subjugate all
Those who won't comply,
I'll take your prejudice and
Pride and show you why -
The values that you hold so dear
(all your laws and rules),
They hold no more sway here
Than the mutterings of fools.
Just look about you and
I'm sure that you will find -
Heaven lies within our hearts
And Hell is but a figment of
Your mind.

These teachings that you deem so
Sacred bcome words devoid of meaning,
When compared unto a faith that

Preaches something worth believing.
What is to become of us when
Truth is turned to lies,
Will none remain to wipe the tears
When Mother Nature cries?

Proceed with caution -
Subservient to all you survey,
Hidden dangers await us on
Each step of our way.
Do not falter -
For if you do you will fall,
Prey unto perils far worse
Than you've encountered before.
Compared unto the threats we face
Your devil seems so mild,
A relic from the faerie-tales my
Mother told me as a child.

Why do you carry your God
Like a weapon -
A dagger drawn ready to strike
At the heart of a foe when you
Don't really know the reason
That you fight? -
To replace our disgrace with
The 'loving' embrace of your Lord -
Can't you see that the plans
Made for me and my people
To us seem absurd.

Death is the only recourse
I require in my hour of need.

Impassive it shows no remorse
For folly and greed.

Pre-emptive prejudice has
Dogmatised your life,
These blinkered views that once
Held true will no longer suffice.
For in my world there is no point
Where you can draw the line,
'twixt good and evil,
Saint and sinner,
Damnate and divine.
Shaven-headed servant of
An infantile faith -
By what right do you presume
To come and take my place?
If there is one grain of truth
Amidst your hoard of lies, 'tis
""Love your neighbour as yourself""

With this alone I can abide.

The way of the warrior
When living your life
Like an arrow in flight
You must always accept that
The end is in sight,
Be gtateful at least for the fact
That you knew you came to death -

He did not come for you.
You are like targets
Who sit and await -
Patiently suffer
The arrows of fate,
Saying ""I am but mortal
And destined to die -
I can change nothing
So why should I try?""
Each morning you wake is an
'ember day' dawning,
Your penance for living in
Permanent mourning.
By erst while ideals your
Hearts are enslaved,
You crawl out of the cradle
Straight into the grave.
What reward is a banquet
Of red wine and bread,
When you hunger for life -

But on death you are fed?

Do not underestimate
The task you undertake,
Overcome your hopes and fears
And meet them face to fate.
These spirits aren't your enemies -
But neither are they friends,
Do not dare insult them lest
All nature you offend.
They who were here before us
Will remain when we have gone,
And though we're long forgotten
Still their memory will live on.
Perhaps one day mankind will see
The error of it's ways,
And in it's future glimpse
Reflections of our yesterdays.

That we lack now they have gone.

Betrayed I taste the bitterness

Of pain upon my lips.
Though I try to drown my sorrows
They will surely drown me first,
For swallowing my pride 

Won't quench this thirst.
MY SOULS LAMENT:
In this darkness light has faded -
Hope becomes despair,

You have worn then cast aside.

So what if I have been to be

I better steal your heart and you’ll like it

And I don’t think it’s any kind of secret
I feel you from a million miles away

And your love is the best thing that I got
And it’s only just begun, but it’s never gonna stop
It's the best thing, the best thing that I got

I know sometimes it seems like I
I'm just a little bit behind
I get back on the beat and you know it
And sometimes I can tell that I
I'm just a little out of time
I make you skip a beat and I know it

But I don’t think it’s any kind of secret
I think of you a billion times a day

And your love is the best thing that I got
And it’s only just begun, but it’s never gonna stop
It’s the best, the best thing that I got

So don’t feel lonely tonight
You know I’ll never be hard to find
So don’t go out of your mind (your mind)
You know I’ll never be too hard to find

I know sometimes it seems like I
I'm just a little bit behind

But I'm way too proud, never giving up

Feel like giving up, but I'll never stop
Run run, running like a fool
Never win if you never lose
And find hope and a little truth
Gonna learn new tricks, gotta jump through hoops

Oh, something's gotta happen
Something's gotta give and something's got to break
I know, someday it's gonna happen
Someday it's gonna give, can't always be this way

And if the riptide comes to get me
And pulls me under, it won't upset me, I'll go down
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
I'll throw the white flag of surrender
Knock me down, not forever, just for now

Not forever, just for now

Sabrina Carpenter,"Here I am again, the same old situation
Why does the guy thing have to be so complicated
I should’ve played it cool, instead I made a fool
Oh, the things I do

I do stupid things when it comes to love

Well, you can’t blame a girl for trying, oh oh

No, you can’t blame a girl for trying, oh

And maybe someday
I’m gonna catch a shooting star falling out of the blue

And just as I’m giving up, my heart is palpitating
Here comes another one and it's so intoxicating
Being where I’ve been I know that in the end
I’ll do it all again

It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way all the way",All the Way
Sacha Distel,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad;
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Sacha Distel,"I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard, for love to ever last
My heart should be well schooled, 'cause I've been fooled in the past
And still I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
 
I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast

Sacha Distel,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You
Sacha Distel,"It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.
For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults, I love you still,
It had to be you, wonderful you,
It had to be you.

It had to be you, it had to be you.

Sacha Distel,"L is for the way you look at me.
O is for the only one I see.
V is very, very extraordinary.
E is even more than anyone that you adore can.

Love is all that I can give to you,
Love is more than just a game for two.
Two in love can make it.
Take my heart and please don't break it,
Love was made for me and you.

Sacha Distel,"Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

Sacha Distel,"Young and foolish
Why is it wrong to be
Young and foolish
We haven't long to be

Soon enough the carefree days
The sunlit days go by
Soon enough the bluebird has to fly

We were foolish
One day we fell in love
Now we wonder
What were we dreaming of

Smiling in the sunlight
Laughing in the rain
I wish that we were
Young and foolish again

Smiling in the sunlight
Laughing in the rain
I wish that we were
Young and foolish again",Young and Foolish
Sacha Distel,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me
Sacha Distel,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April
