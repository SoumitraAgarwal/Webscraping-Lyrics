Pipedown,"Stay, stay focused
There's no time to be outside yourself
Don't let them ever tell you
You can't acknowledge doubt

I think we've had enough
Make me sick 'til I've had enough

Hate, pain
Things I'd like to live without
But now the demons in me
Are there and they won't come out
They are the ones that keep you, distract you
From your home
And while you're filled with anger
You will only stand alone

I think we've had enough
Make me sick 'til I've had enough

Don't waste away
The ends not far away
Don't kid yourself
Your hatred lies with no one else - no

Stay, stay focused
There's no telling of what you might see
But always please remember
The monster is not me",Monster
Pipedream,"There's a place in my heart
That I go when I dream
A place that nobody can see
Every night I see love
I see someone who's waiting
Waiting for someone like me
He must be out there
Somewhere, someone for me

Tell me how long
‘Till I'm not just dreaming
How long, ‘til somebody cares
How long, ‘til I meet an angel
And give him my heart,
When can I start
How long ‘till I fall in love

I sit every night
By my window just wishing
And searching for one perfect star
Can anyone hear me
Dunno if you're listening
Please send him right here
To my arms
He must be out there
Somewhere, waiting for me

Tell me just how long, will it be...

Tell me how long
‘Till I'm not just dreaming
How long, ‘til somebody cares
How long, ‘til I meet an angel
And give him my heart,
When can I start
How long ‘till I fall in love

I've always believed
That my dreams would come true
That one of these nights
He would appear
He'd be here in my arms
I see it all, so clearly
How it could be
I wish he was kissing me now...

Tell me how long (how long)
Till I'm not just dreaming
How long, ‘til somebody cares (‘til somebody cares)
How long, ‘til I meet an angel (my angel...)
And give him my heart (heart...)
When can I start
How long ‘till I fall in love (in love...)

How long ‘till I fall in love...
How long ‘till I fall in love...
How long ‘till I fall in love...",How Long

Yeah thought you had me played huh 
Well check this out yeah 

See all those times you thought you had me 
Fooled yeah 
You were wrong ''cause I knew this is for you 
This is for all the times you did me wrong 

And all the lady friends you strung along 
I don't ever want to see you cry 
But I'm tired of your lies 
This is for all the things you put me through 

When lord knows I gave my all to you 
No more in and out of my life 
Now's the time I do things right 

You can have 
You can have all your money 
You can keep all your lies 
Keep all your lies 

You can take all of the games you played

I'm over you and 
I want to know baby 
What ya gonna do 
What ya gonna do when I'm gone 

Now that I'm done trading things with you 
I'm wondering who your friends are calling a fool 
I must have been blind to let you in my life 
Telling my friends I've found Mr. right 

I'm so much stronger now that I've left you 
You wouldn't believe the changes I've been through 
It won't happen to me again I'd rather keep hanging 
Out with my friends

What ya gonna do when 

I'm over you and 
Let me know 
What ya gonna do 
What ya gonna do 

Oh I used to cry myself to sleep at night 
'Cause you never gave a damn about me 
So many rumors I could write you a song 
Of how you keep on doing me wrong 

What ya gonna do when I'm gone 
What ya gonna do when 
I'm over you and 

What ya gonna do 
What ya gonna do when

I'm saying bye bye

Pippa Hayes,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",Nearness of You
Pippi,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

Who know where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way
All the way",All the Way
Pippi,"The leaves of brown came tumbling down
Remember in September in the rain
The sun went out just like a dying amber
That September in the rain

To every word of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seemed to play our sweet refrain
Though spring is here to me it's still September
That September in the rain

To every word of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seemed to play our sweet refrain
Though spring is here to me it is still September
That September in the rain

That September that brought the pain
That September in the rain",September in the Rain
Pique Novo,"Existem muitas coisas que é melhor não ver
Quando a gente ama
E outras que só tem coragem de dizer
Quando está na cama

Eu me apaixonei
Faço tudo por amor
Mas só que nada acontece
Todo mundo diz
Que é melhor eu esquecer
Porque você não me merece

E sempre me procura quando te convém
Eu não nego aceito
Eu vivo me enganando
Que está tudo bem
Não tem outro jeito

O que eu vou fazer
se o medo de perder
E esse amor já me sufoca
Se pra eu viver
só preciso do prazer
De quando você vem e me toca

Eu tenho muito mais
Guardado pra você
Aqui bem num lugar que ninguém pode ver
Tá no meu coração
Esperando uma atenção
Que pena que você parece não querer

Eu tenho muito mais guardado pra você
E cada dia mais aumenta o meu amor
Tá no meu coração
Esperando uma atenção
Que pena que você não dá nenhum valor",Eu Tenho Muito Mais
Pique Novo,"Eu em minha vida torta
Difícil até pra me sustentar
Deus aperta mas não enforca
Eu sabia que ia melhorar
Um empresário japonês
Me viu batucando no terreirão
Finalmente chegou minha vez
No outro mês eu já estava no Japão (sayonara)
Conheci uma linda japonesa
Que adorava dançar miudinho, miudinho, miudinho
Nosso amor era uma beleza, ai, ai, ai, ai
Aquele olhar apertadinho
Voltei com saudades mas tô infeliz
Ela faz tanta falta pro meu coração
Se ela não vier no meu país (ôh infeliz)
Eu volto correndo pro Japão

Sem você meu pranto chora

Pirates of the Mississippi,"Well, you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

I'm only a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife

Pirates of the Mississippi,"I don't know, if I can recover
How can we be friends, if we can't be lovers
It's killing me, thinking of you with him

Call it pride, call it stubborn
But I won't give up till I know
There's no other way to start all over again

'Cause there's just so much, one man can take
Even the strongest heart can break
When the tears start to roll
It's like trying to hold back the sea

But I won't give up, you know how I am
I'll fight till I fall and make one more stand
How can I lose fighting for you

'Cause there's just so much one man can take
Even the strongest heart can break
When the tears start to roll

Pirates of the Mississippi,"Too much workin' will make your back break
Too much trouble will bring ya heartache
Too much gravy will make ya fat

Too much money will make ya lazy
Too much whiskey will drive ya crazy

Too much, just ain't enough
Too much ain't enough
Baby, you're the only thing
I do too much of ain't enough

Too much hot rod get ya a ticket
Too much dog make ya kick it
Too much hidin' out will find ya
Too much you know, what'll blind ya?

Too much wrist watch make ya hurry
Too much waitin' will make ya worry
Too much smokin' will give ya cancer
Too much cocaine ain't the answer

Too much walkin' will wear ya shoes out
Too much juice will blow your fuse out
Too much Mexican food will fill ya

Too much chip will bruise your shoulder
Too much birthday will make ya older

Too much fun always cost me

Pirates of the Mississippi,"I'm standin' at the crossroads in life
And I don't know where to go
You know you've got my heart,babe

Let me play it one more time
Tell the truth and make it right 
And hope they understand me

Now I lay me down to sleep
And pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake,feed Jake

If I die before I wake,feed Jake

Bums and hookers everywhere
Winos passed out on the sidewalk
Doesn't anybody care?
Some say ""He's worthless,just let him be!""
I for one would have to disagree
And so would their Mama's

Now if you get an ear pierced
Some will call you gay
But if you drive a pick-up
They'll say ""No,you must be straight!""
What we are and what we ain't
What we can and what we cain't
Does it really matter?

Some that I thought I was genetically born to miss
I feel it in the morning that I'm getting old
But this part of the birds and bees I was never told

When it's time to say goodbye I'll say it with a frown
Got no chance to look my best when it all keeps falling out

There ain't nothing that can prepare me for this
Can't find the genie that can grant this kind of wish
I know that thinking bout it is gonna only make it worse
At least I won't replace my grass with AstroTurf

When it's time to say goodbye I'll say it with a frown

Can feel it on my hands if I 

I still can't believe this is happening

I consider myself a young adult
I want others to see me that way
If my looks deteriorate, I don't know what it will do to my self-esteem
Is this what I have to look forward to?

Aunt Tammy's in there claiming all the diamond rings
Uncle Bobby's holding up the TV set
The only thing they are grieving over
Is what they ain't gonna get
She's only been in the ground a day or two
I'm glad Mama ain't around to watch this family feud

Great gran daddy's shotgun started it all
She wasn't even cold
Before they ripped it off the wall
Wanda's fighting Angie over antique quilts
Nobody even waited for the reading of the will
If Daddy was here he'd beat us black and blue
I'm glad mama ain't around to watch this family feud

I'm watching it all go down in shame
Wish the whole house would go up in flames
Who gives a damn about a cedar chest?
When we just laid her soul to rest

And the baby ain't been sleeping
All I need is a washing machine

Right around Christmas time
Mama made a turkey
Daddy was worried he was gonna have to break up a fight

Everybody was walking on eggshells
Drinking eggnog instead of beer
We were holdin' our tongues, scratchin' our heads
Wonderin' how the hell we got to here

Hush, hush, don't you dare say a word
Hush, hush, don't you know the truth hurts
Hush, hush, when push comes to shove it's best to keep it hush, hush

And we were eating our pumpkin pie
While the sugar-coated pretty little secret was eating everybody alive

Well daddy's reading propaganda
And he's talking 'bout the end of days
Well cheers to the vodka mama's been sneakin'
Let's all gather 'round and pray

Hush, hush, don't you know the truth hurts
Hush, hush, when push comes to shove it's best to keep it hush, hush

And I took myself a toke
Since everybody here hates everybody here
Hell I might as well be the joke

I'm gonna dance up on the table
Singing ""This Little Light of Mine""
God gave it to me, what good's it gonna do me
If I don't, by God, let it shine

To my killers be careful when you burning up the glock!

Haters in the club (back up)
Gold Diggers (back up)
Broke niggaz (back up)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)

(Verse 1)
I'm in the cut in the club
Scopin the scene
Cup half way full
Smokin the green
She got her hand on my nuts
What does that mean?
Pointed at her friend
And she said, they'll tag team
Now who said dreams don't come true
Its like I'm dreamin
When I come through
I always find something to run through
Speak into the mike mami
Mic check one two
Drunk in the club
Off the chain
But who gives as fuck?
That's why I came
So pour it up
And get down
Ya'll have no choice
But to listen to Pit now

(Chorus)
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)
It don't involve money then (back up)
Dawg, get from me and (back up)
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)

Broke niggaz (back up)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)

(Verse 2)
Everybody knows
Pit's got tight raps
When I'm in the club
DJs bring it back
With no questions asked
But the number one question is
""Does he got cash?""
Lil Jon's at the bar
While me and them eastside boys smoke out
Roll another one
No doubt
Get a couple hoes
Roll out
Beef, you don't want none
To go down
dumb diddy dumb dumb
My times now
The city I'm from
Is covered with federals
That'll make your crew run run
Your crew run run
Its next to come

Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)
It don't involve money then (back up)

I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)

(Verse 3)
I convince mami to creep on the DL
Even though my head spinning
Like some sprewells
Skip the details
Its the vodka bottom line
that's testin my patience like doctors
I'm not impressed by the cool shit
Or those chains or that ice or them cars
All that's bullshit
If that's what your lookin for
Keep lookin hoe
Cause you got the wrong one bitch
I'll let you know
Mami's like damn
That Cuban's shot out
Bitch I came to the club
To wild out
If you came to act up
Then you need to get from me bitch
And back up

Cross the bridge and it'll fuck with ya mind 
Word of advice don't follow the streets, follow the signs 
'cause the last thing you wanna do is get lost, cause it might just cost ya life 
Y'all heard about the smash-&-grabs 
So watch where you put the map on the dash 
Cause they might end up clapping ya ass 
Why you think the traffic lights, they blink at late night 
They don't want you to stop cause the streets'll be filled wit red stripes

2000 heltah skelta, talking bout families and killers 
Vicious like silver-back guerillas see then peel ya 
Niggaz down here ain't tryna feel ya, see ya, hear ya, know ya 
Serve ya, for ya or for ya (Feel it!!!) 
You pussy niggaz been hatin on us for too long 
So we finna prove you wrong, teach you hoes a new song (thats what's up) 
'cause the time is now (now), the place is here (here) 
I could smell you scared nigga, I could taste your fear 
Go make it clear and move the smoke outta yo eyes 
So that when everything go down, it won't be no kind of surprise 
And I got no time for yo lies (No time for lies!!), save 'em for peter 
Just remember my name, I'm facing my heater (BITCH!), let's get it dirty!

M-I-A-M-I till I die, 3-0-5!!! 
Candy paint and leather, they don't fuck wit nothing but dubs or better 
Y'all call 'em street sweepers, we call 'em choppers 
'cause when the bullets spit they spin like helicopters 
This city's filled with crooked coppers and crooked doctors 
So how could these streets not be filled with crooked bitches 
And niggaz cocaine cooking brick flipping bitches trippin for figures 
This Cuban has seen it, heard about it and lived it 
That's why I spit it so vivid, you got it, I want it, you give it 
This is for everybody in county, TGK, Metro West and Stockade 
Doing time 
And if you got more than 365 
And you're up the road rep MIA with pride, That's right!!! 

[Chorus] 
Everything we do is dirty!!!! 
We pull up in the drop, it's dirty!! 
We pound that twat, dirty!! 
Miami!!!, we're dirty! 
Where they lace 'em, roll 'em, smoke 'em and blow 'em dirty! 
Guns they hold 'em, if they clean dogg, they make 'em dirty!

To rip on this  track, I'll rip any broad

Hee's baaacckk!
If Pit's on the job, then there's no need to worry
Dog just hurry up and wait
'cause I ain't Going no where anytime soon
Sick what these rappers want to be?
That's me, times 2
Now...
Get ready for me to take over this game
I'm cutting the flow, like I'm cutting the cane
Things will never be the same
Pause...
There's a lick for 50 bricks
Now pause...
And think about it
Then pause...
Is it really worth it?
Then pause... pause...
FUCK YEAH!!!
I'm ready to go, jump in the ride
Get the mask, get the gloves
Cut off the lights, pop the gat
Run inside, fire'em up or tie'em up
But don't forget to pick up the prize
And upgrade the ??
If they don't give up the pies
Now...
I would hate to have to calm these boys down
'cause to be honest I can't, so Pal...
Why don't you just give us the keys and pounds
Now Guess What He Said?

y'all want me to stop?! Hurry up and wait!
y'all want me shot?! Hurry up and wait!
y'all hurry up and wait! y'all hurry up and wait!

By street cats who didn't get caught up
Like that New Jack Nino Brown at the Carter
I'm the new Tony Montana, only I'm just a
Little bit smarter!",Hurry Up and Wait
Pitbull,"Yeah
Hah
Yo
Ugh
Yeah

(Verse 1)
He went from a street kid doin regular street things
Straight to a street king
Takin over the city, block by block
Breaking down bricks, servin them rock by rock
He's everything a young gun want to grow up to be
But if only these young guns could see
That murder, money, and lust is slowly murderin' us
'cause the drug game ain't what it used to be
So look deeper when they paint you a picture
And try to sell you a dream
'cause a lot of these drug lords turn to the feds, or turn into fiends
The crack game ain't everything it's cracked up to be
Now that same cat that was a, neighborhood celebrity
Is coppin rocks off the news kids on the block
At the same time tryna school them
But these hoodlums got heads as hard as the rocks that he's doin'
Hustlin's like a drug, it's got withdrawal symptoms
And if you know this, you won't skip fame
But you will gain wisdom, and wisdom gains power
Don't let your life go sour over power

(Chorus)
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addicting
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
If you used to push weight you relate (it's the hustler's withdrawal)
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addicting
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
If you used to push weight you relate (it's the hustler's withdrawal)

(Verse 2)
Not only did my father used to deal dope
He used to do the dope he used to deal, I'm juss' keepin it real
Now my father doesn't have shit
I don't have shit
We don't have shit
'cause he didn't stack shit
With all the money he made, he didn't think for one second to put money away
That's 'cause his mind was clouded with white thoughts
He's lucky that he didn't end up outlined in white chalk
The only thing I can say I gained from my father is
Knowledge of the street game
And I hope that y'all follow this
I can't say I haven't sold weed or cocaine
But I can say this
Money that comes quick, leaves quick
And y'all better believe this
'cause this I've lived and witnessed
Catch a couple of charges
Now you're on the Lord's shit list
Now you're forced to do business
Until this business does you of course
You can die doin' dope, or dealin dope, either or
You choose the road that you need to follow
And you choose the people that you look up to as role models

(Chorus)
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addicting
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
If you used to push weight you relate (it's the hustler's withdrawal)
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addicting
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
If you used to push weight you relate (it's the hustler's withdrawal)

(Verse 3)
I know about hustler's
But I won't mention no names
'cause they still got cases pending
And some are even, appealing, life in the cage
At least they made it past the first phase, they passed a certain age
Hustlin's like AIDS
At first your infected with HIV, and then it's full blown
Only difference is, instead of havin' no immune system
You become immune to the system of havin dough, by dealin blow
It's a fast life and even if you survive, your mind will die slow
Dirty money attracts, dirty things
And if you plan to deal dope I hope you're ready for the murder game
'cause that's what it brings
I'm not a preacher, I'm not tryin' to preach, no
I'm not a teacher, I'm not tryna teach, but yet
Like a faucet, I'm tryin' to leak
Any foe, tell these young'ns and their kinfolk
And let em' know there's more to life than a G of coke
If you used to push weight then you relate
'cause you already had a taste of, hustler's withdrawal

(Chorus)
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addicting
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
If you used to push weight you relate (it's the hustler's withdrawal)
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addicting
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
If you used to push weight you relate (it's the hustler's withdrawal)",Hustler's Withdrawal
Pitbull,"Every time I see you, you're trying to take me home
And it makes me wonder, if we were to get it on
Would you take the time to touch me(touch me)
And take me in to extacy yeah

And I wonder if I take you home 
Would you give me your love baby
Would you fulfill my fantasy's

I want to be that man, that you've, never had before
I want to be that man, that'll put it on you fast and slow
I want to be, everything that you need baby and more
It would be no fun, if I told you everything that's in store
You've got those body parts, I just want to explore
Coma with me loco, ven paca mi amor
You got my two boys, below my waistline, singing the blues 
Tell me baby, honestly, what is it exactly you got to lose
Nothing there's always some time in the wall*
And now you know you want some more
I'ma have you going crazy, praising the lord
I fuck like I rap, hardcore 
I'm not a hot boy, I'ma hot man

When it burn slow
Motherfucker I'll stank ya

Taught on these streets
Ain't a god damn thing

You want a life gone
That could be done
I'm like a nigga that did ten years
I'm eager to come
In the game
And do more than entertain

And I always bring the pain

Haters want to slug me

Cause he's the only thing that's above me
Y'all goin feel me till it hurts
Like, losin your family over someone elses work
Or,losin your case cause your co-defendent chirped
Or, losin your brain cause them thangs done burped

Cause you made this all possible
I live a dangerous ass life you know
So I thank you for your doctors and your hospitals
Thank God for the thugs too
He understand what these drugs do
He want to see us all pull through
But only if niggaz in the hood knew
Hell, prayin ain't wrong
But the sqeezin trigger
Could you go kill a innocent man
While these weak niggaz grillin his end
They tellin ya dawg
Reducin they business
If I wasn't doin this
Then I'd go do him in
Cause if he was dead
He couldn't say he knew me then
For them niggaz who lie
When they pull me in
Its in the same older cell that they threw me in
And I just pray for 'em

My dogg Demi, keep ya head up, I gotchu, I promise!
All my chicos, I gotchu, I promise!
Miami, I gotchu, I promise!! I'ma take over this bitch! I promise!
So get ready mothafuckers, this is not a game!! (eeyo!)

I'm from the dirty dirty, where a lot of these cats mix the weed
With the coke and blow dirty, we're off the chain meng
Rap game, crack game, cut it, cook it, chop it, record it
Album shop it, its all the same thang
Y'all look at these blue skies and think paradise
I look at these blue skies, and think what a disguise
That's why its called the ""Magic City"", it's a treat to your eyes
Cross the bridge and it'll fuck with ya mind
Word of advice don't follow the streets, follow the signs
Cause the last thing you wanna do is get lost, cause it might just cost ya life
Y'all heard about the smash-&-grabs
So watch where you put the map on the dash
Cause they might end up clapping ya ass
Why you think the traffic lights, they blink at late night
They don't want you to stop cause the streets'll be filled wit red stripes
Like Jamaican beer, we fry 'em like bacon here
Yo life'll get taken here, I just thought I should make it clear! Yeah!

We pull up in the drop, it's dirty!
We pound that twat, dirty!

Where they lace 'em, roll 'em, smoke 'em and blow 'em dirty!
Guns they hold 'em, if they clean dogg, we make 'em dirty!

Straight up outta Texas, the reckless, PA to be exact
Where the streets is cutthroat and fiends kill you for a G of crack
8 G's and Cadillacs, Chevy's cut on the deltas
Might swang up on ya then hurt ya, nobody here gon help ya
2000 heltah skelta, talking bout families and killer
Vicious like silver-back guerrillas see then peel ya
Niggas down here ain't tryna feel ya, see ya, hear ya, know ya
Serve ya, for ya or for ya (Feel it!)
You pussy niggas been hatin' on us for too long
So we finna prove you wrong, teach you hoes a new song (that's whats up)
Cause the time is now (now), the place is here (here)
I could smell you scared nigga, I could taste your fear
Go make it clear and move the smoke outta yo eyes
So that when everything go down, it won't be no kind of surprise
And I got no time for yo lies (No time for lies!) save 'em for peter
Just remember my name, I'm facing my heater (bitch!) let's get it dirty!

[Chorus: x2]

These boys from the bottom are obsessed with old school Chevy's
We call 'em verts and donks, some we call box Chevy's
Seven-duece, seven-trey, seven-four, seven-five
M-I-A-M-I till I die, 3-0-5!
Candy paint and leather, they don't fuck wit nothing but dubs or better
Y'all call 'em street sweepers, we call 'em choppers
Cause when the bullets spit they spin like helicopters
This city's filled with crooked coppers and crooked doctors
So how could these streets not be filled with crooked bitches
And niggas cocaine cooking brick flipping bitches trippin' for figures
Clip oh no he didn't

This Cuban has seen it, heard about it and lived it
That's why I spit it so vivid, you got it, I want it, you give it
This is for everybody in county, T-G-K, Metro West and Stockade
Doing time
And if you got more than 365
And you're up the road rep M-I-A with pride, That's right!

Wait for you outside 
We can 
End this evening right

What you can do 
We'll have a private party 
For just me and you

It's a Dade thing when you speak cocaine
Slash perico, chi chi get the yayo mang
I'm stating facts
This where we from
The bottom dog
This where you come
When you need it, want it, don't got it, in the drought
Looking for a good price
Hit ninety five south
K's as in kilos
P's as in pounds
E as in ex,
We got it on deck
So show some respect
To the cocaine capital
Dade County bitch!

Shh
Be quiet
Keep it cool, you don't wanna start a riot
I'm cool, I'm quiet
A couple shots will put yo ass on a diet
This is for them big boys
Doing them big things
In the big Chevy's
With them big rims
Making big noise
With them big speakers
And anytime they cook yay
Its some big beakers
Listen buddy
We off the chain
Now what they do, what it is, what it ain't
Listen buddy
We off the chain
I suggest you hand over them thangs
I got my game from Jose Antonio Armando Perez Torres
Ese si era mi consorte
And I missed ya dad
But I know you watching me
With you in heaven
I know ain't stopping me
The game is mine now
I'm building 
I'm just tryna get paper like Seinfeld
Sign, seal, deliver, its done
Ready or not, here I come

Pitbull,"I know y'all listen to my music (red eyes) 
But what I'm a do know is try and describe my life to y'all

Sometimes I fell like I'm loosing it 
My life is upside down 
A gift and a curse that's my life now 
There is no looking or turning back 
I used to watch coke turn to crack that's what made me turn to rap
I fell like Keanu Reeves in the movie Devils Advocate 
Confused but blessed with extravagance 
I thank god for all the opportunities 
Given the opportunity dem boys would put two in me (bla bla bla)
We live in the land of the free, hustlers and thieves 
I made money now I got uncle Sam hustling 
Me for a quarter of what I make 
Hand a quarter sentence to a fake and watch them turn state (that's right)
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)
Until the fed's step in (that's just the way it is) 
Most of these fools are characters 
Men with no character welcome to America 
Where we fight for freedom 
If ain't about oil than we don't need them 
Ain't that the truth? 
Pitbull I'm just tell y'all the way I fell 
Thank god that god made me to keep it real

[Chorus]
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)
Until the fed's step in (that just the way it is)
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)
Till that fame step in (that's just the way it is)
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)
Till dem bitches step in (that's just the way it is)
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)
Till that money step in (that's just the way it is)

Huh hun yo 
After the turf war the smoke clears 
All these years around these busta I'm convinced there ain't no hope here
In the past four years of my lifetime 
I witness leaders sacrifice freedom just to get this pipeline
Guess I'm chosen at the right time mama stress
Facing the table and she's snorting up white line 
Blood is thicker than water
In a few cases your daughter can have touched for the money that in dem suit case 
Tighten my shoelaces the fugitive running 
In fear of a criminal past 'cause dem folks is coming 
I've been wrongfully judged being from this environment 
The city gangs planning retirement 
I'm a a Dade nigga 
Voicing my set 'cause a spray quick 
Took some of the same steps through little Haiti 
As these main nigga (like who) hit man, big dog, and she hound 
Y'all predict it back then shit I see it know

[Chorus]

I escape poverty (poverty) 
I don't own jewelry motherfucker I own property 
You can send dem tsunamis that hit Indonesia (but but but) 
Ain't no motherfucking thing stopping me 
Like good coke I'm a good swimmer 
God knows I done lost but god dam I'm a good winner
It feels great to make something out of nothing 
Yea I'm humble but I tell y'all to push a chicos buttons 
And watch how them thing get to dumping 
Real estate New York game now you saying something 
I only talk about what I know about 
Illegal turn legal this year that's what I'm all about
I'm from the south and I ain't gonna lie 
At fist time I preach ye till god struck me with pride 
I was confused now I'm like let's ride 
Three o five till I die 
Three o five till I die

Mamita te voy a hablar claro 
Yo me siento mal, muy mal 
Ken-Y, explicales 

Ayer me dijistes que me amabas 
Que no habria quien nos separara 
Que yo era tuyo y tu eras mia 
Para nuestro amor no habian medidas 
Pero de repente todo cambio 
Ya no eras la misma cuando haciamos el amor 
Hoy me pides que me vaya sin ninguna razon 
Tu no sabes cuanto daao le hace a mi corazon, perderte 

Dime como olvidarte 
Si no quiero alejarme 
No me pidas que me vaya, no 
(Que no me vaya no) 
(Que no me vaya no) (no) 
Que no ves que ya no puedo 
Que sin ti me desespero 
(Muaecatu eres la razon que yo hago) 
(Todo esto es la razon que Yo trabajo tan duro) 
No me pidas que me vaya, no 
(Yo te quiero dar una vida, diferente) 

Yo te quiero con todo mi corazon 
Pero no entiendo la razon 
Porque siento como tu y yo no somos lo mismo, a lo mejor 
Estamos acostumbrao' 
Y no estamos enamorao' 
O maybe es algo que da duro 
Y viene y se va como un morao 
Pero mami let's work it out 
Es un daao profundo 
Pensar en los aaos 
Que tu y yo viviamos juntos 
Y que, todos esos aaos se fueron por gusto? (No, no)
No me digas eso mami 
Eso yo no lo puedo aceptar 
Un amor como el nuestro es real 
Un amor tan profundo 
Yo te apuesto el mundo 
Que tu te sientes igual 
Un amor que no se puede olvidar 
Un amor que no se puede ocultar 
Un amor tan rico y tan fuerte 
Que no se puede dudar

Yo te adoro, mi cielo 
Yo quiero, vivir, mi vida, contigo 
Yo te quiero complacer 
Pero dime lo que tengo que hacer, dime 
Yo te quiero complacer 
Pero dime lo que tengo que hacer, dime! 

Dime que debo hacer si la verdad es que no puedo 
Alejarme de ti, olvidarme de ti, mamita yo no quiero 
No me pidas mas que no, no te voy a complacer 
Si todo estaba muy bien 
Dime amor, en que falle!?

Where we slang rocks that claim blocks 
And those red and blue lights just keep our streets hot 

C'mon and ride with a nigga 
so I can show you what Dade County really got 
See don't be fooled by South Beach 
Thinking when you come to the Bottom 
You can just run these streets 
You and your jewels are like a menu 
And trust me nigga we intend to eat 

Fuck around and cross that I-Three Ninety Five 
You just run into a bunch of dead end streets 
Niggas with wife-beaters and bare feet 
That's right, I'm talking straight goon style 
Go beyond that about three miles 
and you're now entering the infamous Lil Havana 
Now I know yall studio gangsters be vibing off the movie Scarface 
But the wrong move in this place, 
you'll fuck around and meet the real Tony Montana 

So fuck them palm trees 
I got shit for you to really see 
Like there's a graveyard with bury sub
With niggas buried four generations deep 
And I aint even talking about sister lined next to brother 
I'm talking granddaddy to grandmother piled up on top of each other 
And all that rap about your Lil Haiti connections? 
Nigga you don't even know a real zoo 
But I can introduce you to one that'll kick in your door 
Put you faced down on the floor 
And have your whole family wiring money from Chicago 

But you a star, though 
Okay, nigga if you a real G 
This is where you tell your car to go 

Opa Locka 
Where there is continuous spotlight 
helicopters and a triangle full of choppers 
Carol City will make holes in you so big, 
They can't be plugged by doctors 

Nigga, this is the real Dade County 
Where we are soldiers from birth to the hearse 
That's why my childhood consisted of a bulletproof vest and a Pyrex 
Nigga, you haven't even seen the real Miami, yet 
So Welcome to Miami Dade County, the real Miami 
Where we live and die, for life",Intro

Mamacita so nice to meet ya,
You drunk off that rum,
You shouldn't drive tonight,
Give me the key to that Beamer,
She looked at me and laughed,
Started shakin her ass,

It makes me wonder
How I keep from goin under
With all these around me.
I got em all colors, shapes and sizes,
I'm in over my head, these women gone drown me.
Spike lee was definitely talkin bout me when he made that movie 'jungle fever'.
'cause I like em a little bit darker
Take it from the back to the front, rosa parkuh
But to tell you the truth, it makes no difference
As long as they know what they doin when it's time to get busy
We can take it from the floor to the bed from the bed to the kitchen
Coffee with no cream,
That's like a rock with no fiend
Martin Luther king with no dream,
John Lennon couldn't even imaging such a thing
And for those that don't know nothin,
Welcome to the jungle,

If you got that hot blood
Esto es pa' la gente con sangre caliente,
Turn around now back up,
Preparate mujer porque mi lengua esta fuerte,
Morenita que rica esta,
She don't speak Spanish, ay mama,
That's cool 'cause I'll put the Spanish in ya,
And by the end of the night you'll say ay papa.
I'm that chico that got a fetish with women
Light skin red bones they blow my mind
I'm that chico that'll get em and hit em
Now all of a sudden they wanna be mine
Stop playin with me
Say it with me,
Dale papi, dale papi oh

This doesn't necessarily mean I like uh, dark women,
Doesn't necessarily mean I don't like dark women,
What it means is, uh
To get nasty
To get freaky
To do things you've never done before
To act like an animal straight out the jungle, that's jungle fever.

Pitbull,"A 1980 exodus of 125,000 dreams, a quest to find out what freedom really means at any cost. Boat loads of Cubans lost in a maze of red tape and hate, entered this country through the bottom of the united states and straight set up shop. As Arthur McDuffie was being beat to death by four white cops this world was about to face the music. Between the El Mariel and the 1980 riots, we as minorities Americans could no longer take our freedom for granted and misuse it because incase you haven?t notices we?ve gone from the El Mariel boatlift to the Hurricane Katrina bus lift with the same response. With America standing to help us with one hand on her hips and the other one on her guns. Like 9/11 some how made us all Americans but it took a tragedy to make us all feel like we were one. You see the El Mariel boatlift, Hurricane Katrina and the Oklahoma bombings, we all got something in common and that?s the desire to enjoy a freedom that can not be rearranged by fear. To let nothing stand in the way of the freedom of those who chose to live here so today is 1980 again and I?m that bus that crashed through the gates of the Peruvian embassy. I hope that when I spit this poem the whole world will remember me. I?m screaming like [something] give us us our free, me Pitbull and this industry.

This dedicated to everybody who lost somebody important in their life, 
Don't worry their in a better place now.

I fear not what the future holds
But more what the future unfolds
Cause I'm dying each time that I breathe in life without you (yeah)
Every hour solemn I need you
Undevoured I'm falling now what can I do
There's so much to give
If only I had my hands to fix what you did
So I hold it inside watch as it dies
I can't even look at the sky its burning my eyes
Similar to cigarette smoke I wish I could float far away from here

I hope one day that this pain stops (no no)

I hope one day that this pain stops
Washing me away
Washing me away
Washing me away

I miss you dad

Still dealing with my the death of my father
Still dealing with the death of my best friend
Eddie I'm a miss you dog
But you know that I'm a ride to the end (I love you)
I didn't cry when you died
But I'm a let my tears fall on the track
My brother yula just came home
And it feels good to have him back
(Welcome home dog)
See everything happens for a reason
You don't know what you had till its gone
That's why I'm a take advantage of the fact I'm breathin
And the words of this song are
Dedicated to Eddie and maria
But I know in the future I'm a see ya
I know your both looking down on me , proud
I know ya both love me

I hope one day that this pain stops (no no)

I hope one day that this pain stops

See in life things go wrong
If it don't kill you its only goin' make you strong
So you must hold on
If everything was right then there's something wrong
Ironic ain't it that's just the way life is
That's why I thank god every chance that I get for blessing me
With beautiful kids

What's victory with no laws
What's smiling with no tears
Whats love with no hate
Whats courage with no fears
Just think about it and apply to your life
And no matter what the problem is
Don't worry baby keep your head up
Its goin' be alright

Pitbull,"[Chorus: x2]
Damn, it can't get no worse than this cause I done hit rock bottom
I'mma get up on a muthafuckin' sack and a big ass bottle to solve all my problems
I'm goin' in circles man, goin' in circles man
Sometimes I feel like, feel like I'm goin' in circles man

Damn, if you a man put some muthafuckin' food on the table
That's what she said but still a nigga wasn't able
To get up some bread for the rent, lights, and cable
The gas and water
She actin like I'm tryna starve her
And I know the baby growin' and her belly gotta eat too
Only thing I got left is this gun on my belt, If I can't feed myself how I'mma feed you?
How I'mma ride with this tank on empty, sellin yola hoping that the jakes dont get me
Cause when I leave the crib man that thang go wit' me
My nigga from the jets got stained for a 50
Sack of the hard
Tryna match you a broad
Got 'em shot up in his car by a muthafuckin' dope fiend
A bitch tryna get a fix, put my nigga in a ditch, we been hittin them licks since we was 14
Now they say you in a calmer place
I couldn't tell by the looks on yo' momma face
Now everytime she look at me I see a look of disgrace
She disappointed by the dreams we was lookin' to chase
Cause we was cookin' the base and we was flippin' the spinach
And if a nigga violated then we handled our business
We never knew one day the street shit would catch up with us
And I don't roll with many niggas, you was one of the realest
I'm like

[Chorus: x2]

Damn, open my mailbox and all I get to see is bill after bill
Shit kinda slow ain't no real money be comin' in but yo, I still got ten on the kil'
Ten on the drank, a nigga be on ten when I'm sober to get me over keep me full of the poison
My nigga Rich doin' a bid they sent the boys in, to get him if I would've been wit' him I woulda joined him
And now I'm out here lurkin' the streets wit' no work feelin' like my throat been cut wit' no plug
You know just what I mean if you ever done sold drugs, finna rob me a nigga cause I ain't got no love
And I ain't got no qualification for no career move, people up in corporate america probably fear dude
Gettin' shine off of my rhyme for like a year or two, still got the police lights up in my rearview
Damn, as I sit behind a tint, in a car full of smoke
Hopin' this officer don't do nothin' to make me have to hurt him cause it's over if I get caught up with this dope
Give me a coal, might aswell hang me from a rope
Cause the government lynchin' niggas more than ever before
Sort of like the slavery days but if we ? the change, then how the fuck is we supposed to grow?
They got a nigga like damn

Talk to her, Frankie

Just yesterday you said you loved me
That there was nobody else above me
That I was yours and you were mine
That there was no limits to our skies
But then you had to put our love on hold
When it came to making love, it wasn't you anymore
And now you're telling me to leave
I gotta walk out the door
Can't you see that this is killing me?
It's hurting my soul
Oh baby

When my heart tells me to keep you?
How can you ask me to let you go?
No, I just can't let you go
No, I just can't let you go

Can't you see I'm slowly dying?
But I'm gonna keep on trying
Please don't ask of me to let you go

Let me start
By telling you I love you with all my heart
But I can't understand the reason
When you tell me you're leaving
Girl, me and you were supposed to be forever and ever
Now instead of being in love
It's like we are used to each other
How could we do this to each other?
We use to ride for each other
Die for each other
Cry for each other
Now, it's like all we wanna do is say is bye to each other
I can't let this happen
I refuse to lose you
I love you, baby
It's the truth as usual
I wanna make you happy

Look, baby, just tell me what you need
Look, baby, I know I'm far from perfect
But the game and the money - they can take 'cause it's worthless
I know it's hard to deal with my life
I know it's hard to deal with all the gossip
I done seen 'em wit' this one
I done seen 'em wit' that one
But everything they say is monotonous
Can't you hear it in my voice?
Mami, you know you're my heart, my soul, my love
And I swear to you, baby
I just want to give you my heart, my soul, my love
I know we can work this out
I know we can
Baby, let's try
But one thing I won't do is let this love die
(Is let this love die...)

All I know is the hustle and grind.
All you want is some quality time.
I can't give it to you due to the life that I choose.

I might wear diamonds if they really could freeze time.
But then again time is money and I need mine.
There I go again being selfish, 
And there you go again the love and helpless.

Seen them fall, go broke and lose it all.

I got a bad stomach with these haters on my shit list.

But its outta my hands, 
This is God's plan.

I apoligise, but this game is a monster.

Owes it all to Dade County and the ATL
Picked rap and skipped the triple beam scale
And it's a known fact he gon' die before he fails

I call that hustling backwards and that's real

The way the game is shit, man, I mind as well
I look at these fools on camera flashin' they tools
They must've forgot the streets got codes and rules
But me, I'm confused
'Cause rappers wanna be gangstas
Gangstas wanna be rappers
Ballers wanna be rappers
And rappers wanna be ballers
The truth is it's more sickening than Ebola

But them nights, nights
Only happen, happen
Once in your life, life
And I ain't rappin?

I wanna take you 'til ecstasy, without ecstasy
Just follow me, follow me
And let me do the things I want to
I promise baby that you'll want me to

I wanna strap you, shake you, break you
Make you lose your mind, lose control and lose it all
C'mon baby, I make it hot weather, spring, summer, fall
That's why

In the middle of the night you think about me
In the night, in the middle of the night

Pitbull,"To all the DJ's out there I appreciate the love
Let's show 'em why Pitbull one of the rawest (Mr. 305)
I'm one of the best, one of the rawest
Nah I ain't perfect but bitch I'm flawless
Nah I ain't stupid but the flow is retarded
Barely made high school, the streets was my college
Rappin here for years, workin and grindin
On the streets if you copped it, I supplied it
I've worked everything, every drug you name it
I've seen families get tied up for missin payments
Keep thinking that this thing is just entertainment
Disrepect, get introduced to the pavement
Catch me somewhere on the islands of Caymen
Me, I see the future, ya'll boys cavemen
Now it's cartoons and tv shows
First album gold, remix did fo, El Mariel in stores
I hustle (I hustle), I grind (I grind),
That's why they call me Mr. 305",Mr. 305 (Outro)
Pitbull,"Drop that beat, it's the truth
You don't know what you have until you lose it

I've had all the women you could possibly imagine
In my life, in my life
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money
In my life, in my life

I've had my ups, my downs, I paid my dues
Earned my stripes
But nothing compares to the love
I have for you, have for you

All I know is the hustle and grind
And all you want is some quality time
But I can't give it to you due to the life that I chose
My heart?s so cold to the point my blood it froze

I might wear diamonds if they really could freeze time
But then again time is money and I needs mine
There I go again being selfish
And here you go again in love and helpless

You mean the world to me, baby you know it's the truth
But I don't know who I love more, you or the booth
These are just some things I need to get off my chest
Sometimes I feel all I can give you is sex, I'm sorry

I've had all the women you could possibly imagine
In my life, in my life
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money
In my life, in my life

I've had my ups, my downs, I paid my dues
Earned my stripes
But nothing compares to the love
I have for you, have for you

I ain't gon' lie baby, this life is addicting
The fame, the money, especially these bitches
I've been around it all, I've seen 'em ball
I've seen 'em fall, go broke and lose it all

That's why I work hard 365, 24/7 baby, this my life
I breathe, I bleed, I eat, I sleep, I shit this
I got a bad stomach with these haters on my shit list

Baby, I know it's hard to understand
But it's out of my hands, baby this is God's plan
I came, I saw, I conquered
I apologize but this game made me a monster, I'm sorry

I've had all the women you could possibly imagine
In my life, in my life
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money
In my life, in my life

I've had my ups, my downs, I paid my dues
Earned my stripes
But nothing compares to the love
I have for you, have for you

In my life, I done some wrong
I done some right
In my life, I done some wrong
I done some right

In my life, I done some wrong
I done some right
In my life, I done some wrong
I done some right

I've had all the women you could possibly imagine
In my life, in my life
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money
In my life, in my life

I've had my ups, my downs, I paid my dues
Earned my stripes
But nothing compares to the love
I have for you, have for you

I done some wrong and some right, yeah
Derulo, Pitbull, this how we do

I've had all the women you could possibly imagine

I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money

Humpback, humpback, hoochie momma
All I really want is some coochie momma
You a star when you work the pole
We don't make it rain we make it snow
When you go fast then break it down slow
From the window to the wall
Get low
This is for the strippers that be shaking for them tips
Big oh ass big oh tits, pretty ass pussy, pretty ass lips
Baby your amazing

Tell me who your creeping with, I wanna know
Lying to my face again
I know you on the low
My boys done told me that your doin' wrong
So baby tell me

No le hagas caso daddy
Yo solo soy tuya, amor
Deja que se mueran de envidia, no bailo desnuda

You think that I'm a fool babe
Don't make me lose my cool babe
Not tryin to hear what you say
You can't play me

You must go
I caught you on that stripper pole
Ain't never gonna trust you no
Ass in the air, grabbin' dollars while you droppin' like oh oh oh oh

You don't know the half of it
I found you out last Friday
Thought I was out to get you
At the club I met Peaches
She said she knew your secret
I asked if you were hookin' or creepin'
I had a quick lap dance
Damn near skeed in my pants (Whoa)
Look how bitches got me sweatin' in my white-T
Lovin' how she do me
Then I saw you in stilettos and a thong
Shaking that booty to the ""Do the Brown"" song (Do the Brown)
Shorty gots to go ooh oh...

You must go
I caught you on that stripper pole
Ain't never gonna trust you no
Ass in the air grabbin' dollars while your droppin' like oh oh oh oh 
Ass in the air grabbin' dollars while your droppin' like oh oh oh oh

Let me see you climb the pole to the top
Let go, make it drop
Make it clap, don't stop
One check at a time don't stop
I've been waiting all night to see you take it off
I got some paper baby you can take it all
What you wanna do?
We can go to the back boom, boom fo' sho
These just them things that be going down in them strip clubs
Bend over baby come over and get these crispy dubs

No le hagas caso daddy
Solo soy tuya, amor
Deja que se mueran de envidia, no bailo desnuda

Just yesterday you said you loved me
That there was nobody else above me
That I was yours and you were mine
But the words don't image you to fine
But then you had put our love on hold
When it came to making love it wasn't you anymore
Now your telling me to leave I got walk out the door
Cant you see that this is killing me its hurting my soul (oh baby)

How am I supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to Let you Go
(No I just cant let you go)
Cant you see I'm slowly dyin
But Im gunna keep on tryin
Please dont ask of me to let you go

(pitbull)
Let me start by telling you I love you wit all my heart
But I cant understand the reason
Girl you and me were supposed to be for ever and ever
Now instead of being in love like we used to eachother
How could we do this to eachother
We used to ride for eachother
Die for eachother
Cry for eachother
Now its like all of us wanna say bye to eachother
I cant let this happen
I refuse to lose you
I love you baby
It's the truth as usual
I wanna make you happy
Girl its hard to see
That your the world to me
We've been through it all
Thick and Thin
Right Or Wrong
I cant let you go
Because this love is to strong

How am I supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to Let you Go

Cant you see I'm slowly dyin
But Im gunna keep on tryin
Please dont ask of me to let you go

Look baby just do what you want
Look baby just take what you need
Look baby I know we're far from perfect
With the game with the money
They could take it its worthless
I know its hard to deal with my life
I know its hard to deal with all the gossip
I've seen her with this I've seen him with that
But everything you said was a manotness
Cant you hear my voice
Mami your my heart my soul my love
And I swear to you baby
I just wanna give you my heart my soul my love
I know we could work this out
I know we can
Baby lets try
But the one thing I wont do
Is let this love down (fading echo)

How am I supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to Let you Go
(No I just cant let you go)
Cant you see I'm slowly dyin
But Im gunna keep on tryin
Please dont ask of me to let you go

Dime, I'm tryin to let you go
But the only thing I'm gettin is all this crying
Tell me how am I supposed to let you go(no no no)

And put on my shades
And threw on my headphones

That made me move my feet
Boy that thang' was sticky

And then I heard this (melody)
The dopest one I've ever seen
Something out the usual

So Mr. Pilot please

Hurry to the studio.

Hit the bras and thongs
Long way from what I came from
Fighting in the club
For just sayin' somethin'
Now my passports full
I'm outta pages
New places, new faces
New fans, all ages
Black, pink, purple, orange,
Caucasians
Latinos European and
Asian, Anabaenas'
Knew all my lyrics, it was Amazing!
They spoke Spanish...
I guess its true what they say
Music is the universal language
It's a true blessing you know
To travel the globe

I'll play across the world
(across the world)
Across the world
I'll play across the world
(across the world)
Across the world
I'll play across the world",Across the World

Money got ya tongue tied
Its a slow ride
Up 'til your going down
Funny how your friends lie
Its a landslide
When
You
Wear
The crown
Give it to me!

Tell people that you sing on the radio 
Same people you don't see on the radio (can't stop me now)
Tell people that you sing on the radio 
Same people you don't see on the radio (can't stop me now)

They Said I couldn't do it but I did it
Fought T-B-T beat the most attention.
Met with all labels they ain't get it.
Now I'm taken over
Fuck who with it.
Time ta get filthy rich
Try ta stay not guilty bitch
They said they used ta handle bricks
I believe them when they projects are brick
All they rap about is crack n coke
Knowing they ain't never dealt crack or coke
Yea its a joke
But thanks 'cause I'm laughing all the way to the bank
Ha ha

[Chorus]

Tell people that you sing on the radio 
Same people you don't see on the radio (can't stop me now)
Tell people that you sing on the radio 
Same people you don't see on the radio (can't stop me now)

It's not how you fall
It's how you get back up, dog
Struggle, hustle, fight, hard
That's all I know is right, dog
Blood of a king
Heart of a lion
(Heart of a lion)
They some wrinkled pussy boys
Somene please pass me the iron (please)
Death before dishonor
That means for years I've been dying
Stop your bloodclots crying
I'm here to save Private Ryan

Pitbull,"This is for all the women
That have been stripped of their innocence
(she was daddy's little girl)
But no matter what,
They kept their head up,
And this is my way of saying thank you.
(all alone in the world)

Confused, and don't know what to think,
Cause she thought that she was
(she was daddy's little girl)
Confused, and don't know what to think,
Cause she thought that she was
(she was daddy's little girl)
To find for herself cause she thought that she was,
(daddy's little girl)
(daddy's little girl)
She thought that she was,
She was daddy's little girl
(daddy's little girl)
She was daddy's little girl

I was raised by women,
A women made me a man,
Its just to bad that a man,
Took her innocence.
And god knows that I,
I would finish him,
Diminish him,
End up killing him.
Blame it on the ignorance,
That's where her childhood went,
New country,
New language,
That's how seven years were spent.
Time you can't buy it,
And some lose 'em here
I know that we bumped heads,
Just know mum that I'm here.

Cuba peter pan,
The rebelution was crazy,
I wanna thank you mom,
For the way you raised me,
All your life you wanted
Only one thing,
And that was to say
(she was daddy's little girl)

Confused, and don't know what to think,
Cause she thought that she was
(she was daddy's little girl)
Confused, and don't know what to think,
Cause she thought that she was
(she was daddy's little girl)
To fight for herself cause she thought that she was,
(daddy's little girl)
(daddy's little girl)
She thought that she was,
She was daddy's little girl
(daddy's little girl)
She was daddy's little girl

Took care of me,
Just like a mother,
Till you got pregnant,
Then you was off to Georgia,
It was tough how we,
How we were brought up,
Tougher for you,
Cause you had no father,
Now I understand,
Now that I'm a man,
How much a woman needs,
Someone to call dad,
You cut through the pain,
You walked through the rain,
The game ain't playin' you,
Baby you play the game.
Now your in search of,
That father figure,
And if you find him,
He denies you,
Jenny fuck that nigga,
Karmas a bitch,
Even though I know she wish

(she was daddy's little girl)

Confused, and don't know what to think,
Cause she thought that she was
(she was daddy's little girl)
Confused, and don't know what to think,
Cause she thought that she was
(she was daddy's little girl)
To find for herself cause she thought that she was,
(daddy's little girl)
(daddy's little girl)
She thought that she was,
She was daddy's little girl
(daddy's little girl)
She was daddy's little girl

This is for all the women that stayed strong,
And beat all the odds
(she was daddy's little girl)
The ones that have been raped,
The ones that grew up fatherless
(all alone in the world)
Oh ho
But still found a way to raise their kids,
To do the right thing
(she was daddy's little girl)
This is for y'all,
I love y'all

Pitbull,"Ladies and gentlemen, I like to introduce you all to a new game.
It's called Dope Ball.
Similar rules and regulations, but at the same time very different.

(Ha ha ha)

Goes a lil' something like this.

It's not pick 'n roll, it's more like pick a roll.
What you gon' push? We waste a blow.
If it's all three, then that's the three from the top of the key, before you cup a brick, scrape some grams of the top of the key.
Same for the blow, we call those free throws, they call 'm cheerleaders, we call 'm cheap ho's.
Find some low ones, have them beg a few O's.
Next thing you know you're putting numbers on the... boat.
The whole point is to stay on the courts, but, in this game the whole point is to stay outta courts.
Yeah they similar, but not the same sports.
Both international, import, export.
Extort, and if you get caught, the law is like referee, it can get bought. Extort, and if you get caught, the law is like referee, it can get bought.

Dope Ball, Dope Ball, we play, we play, we playing, Dope Ball, Dope Ball.
This is called what? Dope Ball, Dope Ball!
I know y'all later, if you push weighter, you see a Dope Ball!",Dope Ball (Interlude)

And how they squeeze to listen getting high
They move it hooray
Another dope boy wannabe
All in the club talking back
Wha' wha' what what they got
Pull out the club on 26's
Go str-straight to they momma's house
Like southern Cali they hardly ever make it rain to drizzle
That's why I do them so opposite of these nizzle for shizzles

They used to wanna be like mike
Now they just wannabe on the mic
They cut fucked up deals with music
And even if they got 25 to life
They'll be singing like Whitney
Before before she met bobby
These boys think think they hard
Knowing they green like wasabi

Pitbull,"Drop, They thought he was done dawg,
But he's back bigger, better,
Stronger and free (ha ha ha),
Like I ain't fucked my way out
Of all these motherfuckin' situations, Watch this,

I'm here to remind you, just in case you forgot,
MR 305 no label stay hot,
38 choppers, but please no glock,
Used to move work but had no
Trap no block no spot,
Ma was cool with work, but no rocks,
Until she found my first nickel ruff bag,
Said I had enough shit to push a dad,
So she told me to get the fuck out the pad,
I was out to my first baby mama's crib,
Caught her fuckin' round with her wellas crib,
Thank god for music my saviour,
That's what helped me fight Xavier,
Don't believe these rappers and what they play ya,
I wanna be owner, fuck a playa,
Shit better say it,
I am an owner, bitch!

I got the city on my back and I won't surrender,
Let 'em know now that they gon' remember,
City on my back and I won't surrender,
Let 'em know now that they gon' remember,
They don't know (what I got into),
They don't know (everything I been through),
They don't know (what it takes to get through),
They don't know, they don't know,

[Chorus]
My life, pain,
Struggle, hustle, grind,
Them boys knock me down,
You must be out yo fuckin' mind,
My mom taught me to fight,
Dade county raised me right,
And we gon' take over this thing,
Put down my fuckin' life,

Lemme come back, I've been here for years,
Grindin', blood, sweat and tears.
I don' gave the game my life,
Turned the streets from my bitch to my wife,
Every mornin' I woke up to the same shit,
Everybody sayin' that I ain't shit,
Them boys in the streets on that hate shit,
Them boys on the same street doin' that same shit,
Planned to move bricks, but it's 8 balls,
Y'all want me, I hate y'all but I ate y'all,
Young and stay, we realest,
I'm on my way to the show,
Gettin' paid, marvelous rates,
You the ace I'm the spade,
Cut cut gay, buck buck spray,
This ain't a duck duck goose,
This duck duck hey, plus hey duct tape ace that.

I got the city on my back and I won't surrender,
Let 'em know now that they gon' remember,
City on my back and I won't surrender,
Let 'em know now that they gon' remember,
They don't know (what I got into),
They don't know (everything I been through),
They don't know (what it takes to get through),
They don't know, they don't know,

[Chorus]

Now you can stack the world against me,
Close the doors, I can't come in,
You could bet your life against me,
Bet your ass I'm gonna win,
You take that chance, you roll them dice,
I prove you wrong, you prove me right,
So damn what they say anyway",Triumph

It's 2 P.M. and our snow is falling still
as our good city lay still.

around some no smoking bar
warming on alcohol.

yeah, we step slowly and quiet.

just don't grow old.

When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land
Reach from my hand

I sacrificed my life to give you my life to speakers
I tried to do good even though I've been crossed like Jesus
God knows I got a good heart but my blood's been with demons
I'm fighting myself, believe me, I'm far from ignorant
Far from greedy if you knew what I come from
Knew what I've been through, you think there shoulda
Been another outcome just like most kids
A father, I did it without one
Come from the city where they X you like Malcom
Then you wonder how come I can move in the room
Full of woos, so sweet, so smooth
Thank you mom for making me a man
Let 'em mother fucker knock down my castle in the sand

So you tried to believe in the castles made of sand
When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land
Reach from my hand

Reach for my hand

I live my whole life with the world on my shoulders
So I couldn't care less what this music game throws us
I see them looking in front of ? , but they won't find it
I come from struggle, I am a fighter, must you be reminded
My mother's past has a trap, has a blinded
But I took her past, I took her pain
I made it strength, I fought the game,
Do or die, Pitbull's the name
Now all I see is the future, mom, I love you, I salute you
Then no matter what happens jusst you're the reason I am rappin'


Look I'm from the home where the spit is the wind is the big apple
Came down to south beach to build a new castle
Every day I'm hustling and every day you hassle
Doing what you can and I'm doing what I have to
Throw me in the jungle and I'll show you I'm a winner
I'm coming out with dinner and wearing a chinchilla
I did it for my town to show 'em the big picture
Kid hit the switch, I promise to never switch up
This is for my brother took three and went to jail
I'm sending all my pictures through the mail
He hit me with a letter, I know you'll never fail
So put me on the beach with a bucket and a pail

So you tried to believe in the castles made of sand
When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land
Reach from my hand

Reach for my hand",Castle Made of Sand

You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one
You took my love, took my love

Loquita, I don't play, you know what time it is with me
You want my heart, you got to work
And show me that you'd ride it there for me
I can see right through your eyes, and I know what you tryin' to do
You tryin' to rob, steal, take my love, well fuck you

Take my love, ha ha, not a woman on earth that can do that
Say what, I don't know where you from, or where you been at
I'm letting you know what's up, and if you don't play by the rules
Oh baby, you get cut, I talked so much, you took my love

You took my love, I thought I was the only one
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one

Yaoh, I'm in the club, and the place is poppin'
Sip-sippin' bub and the bass is knockin'
Times are great, 'cause I'm with my crew
But my smile is fake, 'cause I'm missing you
Baby you know that I didn't learn my lesson
Shoulda gave you more time, more love and affection
And when I see you later with that other guy
Keep telling myself a player ain't suppose to cry

You took my love, I thought I was the only one
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one
You took my love, took my love

She took my love, and played me for a sucker
But it don't even matter, 'cause you know I still love her
She took my heart, and threw it on the ground
But it don't even matter, 'cause I still want her around

She's such a love taker, she's such a love taker
It's guaranteed that she's a professional heart breaker
But a great love maker, all in a sheet
She made my heart skip a beat
But for now she's as cold as they come
Not mags, no life and no guns
She took my love

You took my love, I thought I was the only one
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one
You took my love, took my love

So I think I better get in line,
Get in line, get in line,
Get in line, get in line, get in line,
Yeah! cause every nigger in here want you!

You name it, she's got it, realistic about it,
Disrespecting, acting fool in public, I doubt it!
If this skeleton is in a closet, that's where she keeps it,
I don't do business with sharks, so she stays quiet and peeps 'em.
Even if she's playing with time sequence, she keeps 'em,
Never goes through his mind, she respects the crown,
I respect her mind, that's why I made her, man!
For me she'll fight the world, and that's my kinda girl!

[Chorus]

My kind of girl, yeah, she's got a vision!
That's food for thought; now let 'em haters do the dishes!
A pair of high heels and her stockings business,
And ain't talking fishing, she's got a six sense.
don't impress her,
She'll break a full, so watch how you press her!
She came some nothing 'till she know some, yeah, that's true!
For me she'll fight the world, and that's my kinda girl!

[Chorus]

My girl is the kinda girl that walks in the room,
Other girls want my girl, which I think is cool.
My girl is what these others girls wanna be,
But that's why she's with me! my kinda girl!
Sometimes she's, sometimes she's
And when she's with me, she know she's good,
Yeah, she's my town ass bitch!",My Kinda Girl [Deluxe Edition Track]

Stop the movement, they can try if they want to
Ignorar lo latino, si, they can try if they want to

To all the women out there motivated
Always finding ways to make ends meet
All my women out there innovative
You name the game, and they've played it
They've heard all the stories, so save it

Next thing you know she's on top of the bar no clothes for sure
Afrojack
She's telling me to slow down, I live a fast life
Funny thing is she wasn't saying that last night

I can't believe what we did last night
I'm gonna wake up in the morning sun
Roll over, telling everyone
I can't believe what we did last night
I wanna say oh my God that was so much fun
I'll never forget it, telling everyone about last night

What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas
What happens in Miami, never happened

Never happened

Last night we were off the chain
You name it we did it, you loved it for sure
I can't remember her name, but her ass that I remember for sure
Convenient amnesia, remember the good, forget the bad
Remember the present, forget the past
She don't get down, then forget to ask her
One life, two worlds
English, Spanish, one night, two girls
English, Spanish, she's telling to slow down

Different night different city
Different girl but it's all the same
I party every night like my last
Be careful buddy you may run into my past
I don't got a conscience, and I don't got time to deal with the nonsense
I came to get off to everything
So alert all the bonds men
One life, two worlds

Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Every time one of us ending up in tears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere

Is it good that we hurt every day?
Is this worth all the pain that we feel inside?
Am I too blind to see this is happening to me
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere

I live the fast life, going nowhere fast
I see my past life and politely pass
But I’m already planning on doing it big
For my life after death, I live my life after death (baby)
Baby what you think our train is for?
That’s to properly prepare you for war
So I keep you on your toes
So you could look out for your friends that are really foes
This career try to swallow us
Paparazzi try to follow us
I’m everything that my mama was
Rider, survivor, a motherfuckin' fighter
Thank god for this rapping shit
Forget the cash, find happiness
No more life, that’s for the birds
I work hard so you never say these words

Sooner or later that spark just disappears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Every time one of us ending up in tears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere

Is it good that we hurt every day?
Is this worth all the pain that we feel inside?
Am I too blind to see this is happening to me
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere

The critics going nowhere (nowhere)
Thinking that they know me like the Bible, oh hell
But they don’t understand me oh well
Snitching is a sport now so please do tell
The world how I raise hell
Yea, so the clown when I skip jail
I’m just tryina own teams, beat it playa
And dance on the globe like Fred Astaire
The world is ours baby
It’s just waiting for us so don’t be late
And we could both aim for the sky
And shoot for the stars and call it a day
Now you know that I know that we know
If the world wants war cock back and reload
A normal life, that’s for the birds
I work hard, so you never say these words

Sooner or later that spark just disappears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere

But I played the point in school
Broke ankles, more than a few
Broke hearts, yeah, that too

Same player, more chips, more women, more haters
Different toilet, same shh
Why get caught up in the motions?
Why go through the same emotions?
In a sick way she love to see me mad
It gets her wetter than the ocean
She's a good girl gone bad
But bad girls don't like good guys
Now tell me if you think I'm a good guy
That's what I thought huh let's ride

All the things you do, all the things you say
Playing with my heart so I can run away
All the things you did,
All the things you said to me said to me, said
Now I'm lonely in my bed

Then they fall in love and make everything seem what is not
Damn, these are called rules of engagement
Welcome to the world of entertainment
They don't want a man like Reeman
They want a man that's stuck in the remains

I put my thing in motion (I don't know how I do what I do)
I do it all night long (I just do it)

You know the resume
Call it what you want, boy as it may
Not from the bay but hella paid
Every day above ground is a good day so I celebrate
Mami got that bubble-yum booty
I wanna run through it like Rudy
She said ""do you own Nike?""
I said ""not yet"", she said ""then just do it""
Fresh at the Grammy's in a tuxedo
Play about 18 holes on any given day
Tiger Woods steelo, yea I get around but only on the D low

Just to think I used to dream about kilos
Bank account used to be negative

Man what a trippin'
Bogota, Medellin, Colombia
Man what a trip
If you been there
Then you know what I'm talkin' bout
I'm runnin' through the world, y'all walk it out
It's a marathon, not a sprint
Long term, that's how I think
My life could've turned out ugly
I'm talkin' ugly, generino

Where niggas go to see naked ho's
Shake that ass bitch
And be off in the club with a hard-ass dick
Then drop like this bitch
If you want to make the money

Put a hump in your back

Then they fall in love and make everything seem what is not
Damn, these are called rules of engagement
Welcome to the world of entertainment
They don't want a man like Reeman
They want a man that's stuck in the remains
I know it's ironic, but the good girls like bad guys

Se ha vuelto una aventura
Como tu cama ninguna
Yo me enrede en tu locura
Bajo un eclipse de luna

Yo me robe tu ternura
Y he perdido hasta el sentido
Después de lo que vivimos
No paro de soñar contigo

Y te estoy entregando todo
Y tu me dices que estoy loco
No quiero parar (no quiero parar)
Y tu no puedes más (y tu no puedes más)

Se que tu me quieres
Don't you want me oh oh
Se que tu me quieres
Don't you want me oh oh

Yo te leo la mirada y me dicen tus ojos, que tu eres mala
Pero eso me gusta, vamos hacerlo en el carro, entonces en la sala
Entonces en el baño, entonces en la cama, entonces en la mesa
Entonces en el piso y tu gritas, ay que rico dale Pitbull!

Como te suena
No es el 24 de diciembre
Pero si es una noche buena
Deja la pena, que tu estas buena

Y te estoy entregando todo
Y tu me dices que estoy loco
No quiero parar (no quiero parar)
Y tu no puedes más (y tu no puedes más)

Se que tu me quieres
Don't you want me oh oh
Se que tu me quieres
Don't you want me oh oh

Yo te leo los labios y me dicen que tu, que tu sabes mucho
Eres una droga, muy inteligente pero te haces la boba
No matas los hombres, pero si les das soga, ay que loba
Pero eso me intriga, en que me ha metido, ave maría

Vamos a jugar el juego
De formar figuras en público
Volverte loca mami
Tu sabes que yo soy el único

Y te estoy entregando todo
Y tu me dices que estoy loco
No quiero parar (no quiero parar)
Y tu no puedes más (y tu no puedes más)

Se que tu me quieres
Don't you want me oh oh
Se que tu me quieres
Don't you want me oh oh

Se que tu me quieres
Don't you want me oh oh
Se que tu me quieres
Don't you want me oh oh",No Puedo Más

Pitbull,"Tyrese let's go 
She's playin' with my heart 
She's playin' all this games 
Stayin' in my mind 
Drivin' me insane

I just wanna fly far away from here 
Take me to a place way above the atmosphere 
I just wanna fly far away from here 
Take me to a place way above the atmosphere 
Take me away 
Come and take me away 
Come and take me away 
Come and take me away 
Come and take me away 
Take me away 
Come and take me away 
Come and take me away

She says she loves me 
She says she loves me not 
She's playin' with my mind 
She's playin' with my heart 
It's a contract 
And the devil breached
Life can taste sour 
But god it's sweet 
We can work it out 
And put the future past us 
I mean the past the past 
And make the future last 
Old school mentality 
But make that future cash 
Now take it back to the future 
And shake your future ass

What did I do 
What did I say 
To make you hate me so much 
Where should I go 
Nobody knows 
Maybe I lost my touch 
When I look in your eyes and I see you cry 
I'm thinking how can I make this difference 
When you stood by my side 
Through the lows and highs 
Maybe my mind just twisted

I just wanna fly far away from here 
take me to a place way above the atmosphere 
I just wanna fly far away from here 
take me to a place way above the atmosphere 
Take me away

I just wanna go a little bit to the left of here 
Connect and lift to the atmosphere 
Touch the stars sleep in the sky 
Wake up with the sun, hands up high 
Top of the morning middle of the night 
I know the majors don't fight, that's right 
But not on earth, thing's so hectic 
It's love but you don't respect it 
I gotta go 
Weather it's culture first 
If I don't leave first 
You might leave in a hurry 
So take that clutch 
Pack your purse 
When you come back here I'll be gone 
I gotta move on 
This to much for my psyche 
What makes you wanna fight me 
I gotta get in my Nike, go with no fear 
Any place except here

When I walk in the door 
You walk away 
'Cause you don't wanna see my face 
Sorry I lied 
Sorry you cried 
Feel like this love just died 
Everything that I do it makes you cry 
To late to apologize 
I'm sorry the way whey ended this page 
Now let's put it all behind

I just wanna fly far away from here 
take me to a place way above the atmosphere 
I just wanna fly far away from here 
take me to a place way above the atmosphere

Don't need no proof or no validation
You leave no wound on you second to none
You said you over me but you looking lonely
So as far as my eyes can see, you look better on me

They say you really doing good for yourself
But I know you out there feeling so lonely

Don't need no proof or no validation
You leave no wound on you second to none
You said you over me but you looking lonely

I can't listen to this new school shit to me it's just so-so

I may not like the players, but I love the game
I love the hustle and that's real
And that's why love is a battlefield

Such a beautiful baby
Gonna teach him what's wrong and what's right
Gonna show him direction

He probably wouldn't change it even if he could at all

You got to read between the lines
What is not and what is real
You got to learn how to recognize
What you're holdin' in your hands
What you see before your eyes
If you're gonna understand
You got to learn how to recognize

Heart is in danger
Well, love is a stranger
When the fear turns the anger to rage
It's not makin' any sense
'Cause you don't know the difference
Wouldn't know it if it slapped you in the face
Now it's all mixed up
It's all a big mistake
He don't know the difference between love and hate
He probably wouldn't change it even if he could at all

Why should I understand
When I could not comprehend what you say
Just shove it in my face
But if I cannot be made

Pitingo,"At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock, I should have made you leave your key
If I'd known for just one second you'd be back to bother me
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Do you think I'd crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give and I'll survive
I will survive, hey, hey

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh-so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high and you see me
Somebody new
I'm not that chained-up little person and still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
Well, now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's loving me
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye

And took the sky to the ground

Pixie Lott,"Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Felt like I was having one of them days,
When nothing goes right, so I drift away,
Stuck with my back up against the wall,
Didn't know it was you I was waiting for,
Close to tears I was stressing out,
With you I forgot what I worry about,
Took your time but at least you here,
And all the drama's disappear

Oh, you saved my life you saved my life

It started out as the worst day,
But now you got me feeling like its my birthday,
You got me singing like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
You got me like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
Caught in the rain with no lifeline
Till you came along and brought a piece of sunshine
You got me singing like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
You got me like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)

Don't need to party or Bacardi and coke or cake,
I get exited when I know I see your face,
We can stay home cause its just as fun,
An invitation you can be my plus one,
Now I know there's nothing that I can't do,
I'm pretty sure that its something to do with you,
Took your time but at least you here,
And all the drama's disappear,

Pixie Lott,"(You know I'm trying to make it happen for us right now
I gotta do what I gotta do, for me and you)

I remember we were living like kings and queens
In a little tiny castle made of hopes and dreams
It was destiny, meant to be, so complete, the perfect team
Suddenly there's a glitch in the system
And between us is a big strip of distance
They say it's supposed to make the heart grow fonder
From all I can tell it couldn't be wronger

A little bit more goes a long way
A little bit of right goes the wrong way
I keep giving you keep taking
Trying to make a living be patience

I just don't know where to go
So I'm dancing on my own
I've been waiting way too long
Dancing on my own
Play one more song, song, song
But you're not coming
Song, song, song
But you're not coming home

I don't want you dancing by yourself
And I don't want you picturing yourself with someone else
I know I made some promises and honestly I wanted this to work out
I didn't know the shiny star I found was about to burn out
So what now, we go around like a record
I'm feeling disconnected and you're feeling disrespected
I don't know how this going back but 'til I'm home you should turn that track on

And that's all I get from you
But I give my all to you
And that's all I hear from you

I just don't know where to go
So I'm dancing on my own
I've been waiting way too long
Dancing on my own
Play one more song, song, song
But you're not coming
Song, song, song
But you're not coming home

I always think about her
Try to not over think about her
I always dream about her
Try not to dream about her
I'm feeling so lost without her
I, I, I, I try to come home
And it's so hard being out on my own
It breaks my heart to leave you alone

I just don't know where to go

I've been waiting way too long

Pixie Lott,"At the end of the dream
If you know where I mean
When the mist just starts to clear
In a similar way
At the end of today
I could feel the sound of writing on the wall

It cries for you
It's the least that you can do
Like a spiral on the wind
I can hear it screaming in my mind

Long live rock 'n' roll

In a different time
When the words didn't rhyme
You could never quite be sure
Then on with the change
It was simple but strange
And you knew the feeling seemed to say it all

It cries for you
It's the least that you can do
Like a spiral on the wind
I can hear it screaming in my mind

If you suddenly see
What was happened with me
You should spread the word around
And tell everyone here
That it's perfectly clear
They can sail above it all on what they've found
It cries for you
It's the least that you can do

But you bring out the worst in me
There's nothing that I wouldn't do (for you)

Wish that I was strong enough to weather this storm

But when I say ""I'll leave"" you don't believe me anymore

Maybe that's why you don't care

You're the reason I still choke
Used to be your love will take my hurt away
But now you love to watch me break, mm

Pixies,"I was driving, doing nothing on the shores of great Salt Lake
When they put it on the air, I put it in the hammer lane
I soon forgot myself and I forgot about the brake

I forgot about all laws and I forgot about the rain
They were talking on the Nine and all across the Amy band
Across the road, they were turning around and headed south with me

It got so crowded on the road, I started driving in the sand
My head was feeling scared but my heart was feeling free
The desert turned to mud, it seems that everybody heard

Everybody was remembering to forget they had the chills
Then I heard the voices on a broadcast from up on the bird
They were getting interviewed by some good man whose name was Bill

I'm almost there to Vegas, where they're puttin' on a show
They've come so far, I've lived this long
At least I must just go and say, ""Hello""

I think it used to sit right here
Encrusted in blue and hard and true
For now I will kiss her finger

Have you ever seen Andro Queen
Wandering all for her ruby?
One day she'll come in through my window
Yes, she gave me her own true pledge

For what's missing I'll sacrifice my flesh
Only kissing you is so hard in this wild thresh
That's how it's been with Andro Queen

Loving on our bed of flowers
Breathing in the smell of her musk
In a moon of milk she is scared, yes, she is
But she shows me under her silk

For what's missing I'll sacrifice my flesh
Only kissing you is so hard in this wild thresh
I wave goodbye to Andro

Mi aspekti cxe via mano al vidi la ringo
Kaj ni will promeni kune al via cambro
Nia ami will esti nova
Nia ami will esti nova

She's off in a silver rocket
Off to the gas and rings of Saturn
Off her head she gave me a lock, yes, she did
For my neck a rusted locket

For what's missing I'll sacrifice my flesh
Only kissing you is so hard in this wild thresh",Andro Queen

This can't be love
It's just pain
We you are in my arms
It hurts so much
We always go alone
On a car ride
From the radio you can hear
'itoshi no erii' ('my love, so sweet')

We look
Just like
We were lovers
And then
We are
Always very tired

Baby baby ooh
Baby baby
Please just
Tell me you love me
Ooh baby baby
Please say it again
That you love me

You are not an angel
You're just a girl
You'd better take a nap
On the backseat ('my love, so sweet')
I don't think we'll be going
Anywhere else tonight
Let's go back
To your place after two ('my love, so sweet')

We are
Silent
We don't talk
And then
You end up crying

Baby baby ooh

Please just
Tell me you love me
Ooh baby baby

Loving eyes meet, but

It's okay if that's all there is
You are riding a dream boat
Paradise someday
Surely can be reached

In an strange city
An unexpected encounter
Surely this must be
A trick of the gods

Magical connection
Two hearts
Love's parallel lines
But it's OK

Ah how mysterious
Ah so mysterious
Ah",Magical Connection

We all love jack, we are sailors
The name of our boat is
Shirley temple

Then one day came the devil sergeant
While he was drunk he swore like a flute
He threw her photo up to the blue sky
What's more, he hit me on the head
With the deck brush

My name is jack, my important mascot
Greta garbo's picture in a bathing suit
We all love jack, we like very much
The greta garbo that now floats on the waves
I wonder if she'll make it to hollywood

Day after day, all I see is the sea
I climb the mast, from morning to
Night I'm depressed
Joyful buddies laurel & hardy
Say with amazement
""be skillful like errol flynn""

From today I'm deck boxing from dawn to dusk

In this new morning
Love is always like this

It begins suddenly
For no apparent reason
Especially in the morning
A clear early morning

On a day when
Everything looks
Shining bright
On a day when you whispered

One word: 'love'
This new morning's
Memorandum number two:
The perfect world

Will simmer with love
In the new morning
The smell of pancakes
I'm hungry

The follow up for
This morning's memorandum:
Everybody is entitled
To a perfect day

In the new morning
Fresh juice
Everything is going
Too well today

It's as if the world
Was going to change today
When everything
Goes

Wrong
Please just say this
One word: 'love'
And hug me

The summarized version
Of this morning's memorandum:
One day
There will be a perfect world

A moment in the morning
A peaceful moment
In this new world
In this perfect world",A Perfect World [Sunaga Texperience Remix]

It's all emotion when you take control,
I can feel wild horses running in my soul.
Oh my love, all I see

If this going to kill us then let it go,
Quit dreaming this is real life baby

Up high above a desert sky where the space shuttles scream,
Sixteen men from a dying earth take their last dream.

Let me tell the second mother it's been done

But the second mother with the seventh son
They were out on that highway sixty-one
Now the roving gambler he was very bored
Trying to create a next world war
And he found a promoter fell off the floor

And the color was red and he drove me
He drove me out of my mind
I'm over it now
It was spring or summer sixty five I don't remember
Steaming and sweating and sticking against the wheel
And I could see the tendons stand out in the back of his neck
And he used to make me pray, wearing a mask like a death's head
When he put me there in the back seat, and he said

Jesus save me
Jesus save me

Inherited his father's hate that what he'd say
And he custom of destruct the pain of every escape but somehow
He could make joy come loose inside
I would feel really I would feel really and truly alive
And I would do anything for him
It just wasn't enough
It was never enough
He'd turn to me and say
He'd, he'd say ""even the son of god had to die, my darling""
And he wanted everything
He wanted everything
He wanted the honey from the king
Each new moon
He used to make me pray
Every morning
Hidden in the backseat, such Jesus
He'd make me pray
And he'd in there when he wanted everything
He wanted the honey from the king

We wanted success
Until nothing was enough
Until my middle name was excess

Somehow I lost touch 
When you went out of sight
When you got lost into the city
Got lost into the night

I was in need of help
Heading to blackout
'Till someone told me ""run on in honey
Before somebody blows your goddamn brains out""

You shoplifted as a child
I had a model's smile
You carried all my hopes
Until something broke inside
But now

We float
Take life as it comes
We float
Take life as it comes

So will we die of shock?
Die without a trial?
Die on Good Friday?
While holding each other tight

This is kind of about you
This is kind of about me
We just kinda lost our way
We were looking to be free

At one in the morning
Watching the lights flash
In Manhattan

I see five bridges
The Empire State Building
And you said something
That I've never forgotten

Describing the colors
And the smells of our homelands
Acting like lovers

How did we get here?
To this point of living?
I held my breath
And you said something

And I'm doing nothing wrong

Fell from your lips
66 kisses
To rest on my child fingertips
66 lovers
To come till I tell
66 positions
To take on this well-worn train

66 magicians
Deliver the goods
Documented our marriage
For some silent film in Hollywood

Is it not what you thought it would be?
Is it not what you wanted it to be?
Was I not what you thought I would be?
Is it not what you wanted it to be?

60 mouths talking
But making no sense
Of life and of liberty
And the pursuit of happiness
Waiting for something
To smash a few holes
In the wall of good fortune
And the windows to a outer world

And 66 promises
They came with a kiss
Provided a meaning
Now I see how it really is

Do you remember watching?

To all the men whom I've loved
To all the men whom I've loved
I dedicate my song saying
""Today is the day, today is the day""

So we fall and we fall again
And I have come to tell you today
That I loved you there's still time to save
The falling hearts of our children

Through hating and loving
Through lucking and nothing
Through a manner of sorrows
That I have spoken

I open up my tender heart
I open up my tender heart
To all the men whom I've loved
All of those who I adored

But I remember something
I remember walking
When my heart was frozen
With that feeling

It's gotta give, it's gotta change
It's gotta give, it's gotta change
Turning round and round saying
Today is the day, today is the day

So we fall and we fall again
And I have gone to tell you today
That I loved you there's still time to save

Is holding my hand

Shelled by a million bullets
From gunners, waiting in the corpses
With hearts that threatened to pop their boxes,

PJ Harvey,"A restlessness took hold my brain
And questions I could not hold back
An orange monkey on a chain
On a bleak uneven track

Told me that to understand
You must travel back time
I took a plane to a foreign land
And said, I'll write down what I find

Beneath a mountain's jagged shelves
Cloaked with snow and shadows sheer
Plates tipped up upon themselves
The pain of fifty million years

And mules and goats were running wild
A happy chaos carried on
And old men and the young boys smiled
And worked until the day was gone

The packs of sandy-coloured dogs
Walked streets that looked like building sites
But piles of rocks and dust and smog
Could not block out a different light

When I returned I ran to meet
The monkey, but his face had changed
He stood before me on two feet
The track was now a motorway",The Orange Monkey
PJ Harvey,"Oh my Anacostia
Do not sigh, do not weep
Beneath the overpass
Your Savior's waiting patiently

Walking on the water
Flowing with the poisons
From the naval yards

Saying what will become of us?
What will become of us?
Oh

Wade in the water
God's gonna trouble the water

A small red sun makes way for night
Trails away like a tail light
Is that Jesus on the water

Oh

PJ Morton,"One month ago today
I was happy as a lark
But now I go for walks
To the movies, maybe to the park
I have a seat on the same old bench
To watch the children play, huh
You know tomorrow is their future
But for me just another day
They all gather 'round me, huh

Like the roadkill
I'm paralyzed
You see through my disguise

At the drive in

Pull the lever
Break the fever

Now nothing ever ever goes my way

One fluid gesture
Like stepping back in time
Trapped in amber
Petrified
And still not satisfied

Airs and social graces
Elocution so divine
I'll stick to my needle
And my favorite waste of time
Both spineless and sublime

You pucker up, our passion's spent.
My hearts a tart, your body's rent.
My body's broken, yours is bent.

Carve your name into my arm.
Instead of stressed, I lie here charmed.
Cuz there's nothing else to do,
Every me and every you.

Sucker love, a box I choose.
No other box I choose to use.
Another love I would abuse,
No circumstances could excuse.

In the shape of things to come.
Too much poison come undone.
Cuz there's nothing else to do,
Every me and every you.
Every me and every you,
Every Me...he

Sucker love is known to swing.
Prone to cling and waste these things.
Pucker up for heavens sake.
There's never been so much at stake.

I serve my head up on a plate.
It's only comfort, calling late.
Cuz there's nothing else to do,
Every me and every you.
Every me and every you,
Every Me...he

Every me and every you,
Every Me...he

Like the naked leads the blind.
I know I'm selfish, I'm unkind.
Sucker love I always find,
Someone to bruise and leave behind.

All alone in space and time.
There's nothing here but what here's mine.
Something borrowed, something blue.
Every me and every you.

As the cigarette burns on my chest
I wrote a poem that described her world
That put my friendship to the test
And late at night
Whilst on all fours
She used to watch me kiss the floor

What's wrong with this picture?

Farewell the ashtray girl
Forbidden snowflake
Beware this troubled world
Watch out for earthquakes
Goodbye to open sores
To broken center floor
We know we miss her
We miss her picture

Sometimes it's faded
Disintegrated
For fear of growing old
Sometimes it's faded
Assassinated
For fear of growing old

Farewell the ashtray girl

Beware this troubled world

Goodbye to open sores
Goodbye and furthermore

This is the story of Melody Nelson 
Apart from me, no one 
Ever took her in his arms 
Under her thumb, ice in the sun 
She was nothing but love, poor Melody Nelson 
Her life was more said than done 
But her days were numbered nil 
Count fourteen falls
Fifteen on call 

A baby tiger was Melody Nelson 
Forever purring in the sun 
Just as dangerous as a child with a gun 
Shooting me down 

Oh my melody, my Melody Nelson 
Still playing hurting games for fun 
As adorable as dumb 
Deaf to the sound 
To what's going down",The Ballad of Melody Nelson

Sailed the seas for a hundred years
And left me all alone

Now I've been dead for twenty years
I've been washing the sand with my ghostly tears
Searching the shores for my Jackie-oh

And I remember the day that the young man came
Said, your Jackie's gone, he is lost in the rain
And I ran to the beach
And laid me down

You're all wrong, I said
And they stared to the sand
That man knows the sea like the back of his hand
He'll be back some time
Laughing at you

And I've been waiting all this time
For my man to come, take his hand in mine
And lead me away
To unseen shores

Searching the shore these long years
And I'll walk the sea forever more
