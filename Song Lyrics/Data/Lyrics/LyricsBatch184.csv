Jack Doyle,"Paradise can not refuse us
Never such a happy pair

Everybody must excuse us
If we walk on air

All the shadows now will lose us
Lucky stars are everywhere

As a happy being
Here's what I'm foreseeing

For you, for me, forever more
It's bound to be forever more

It's plain to see
We found, by finding each other
The love we waited for

I'm yours, you're mine
And in our hearts
The happy ending starts

What a lovely world
This world will be
With a world of love in store
For you, for me, forever more.

What a lovely world
This world will be
With a world of love in store
For you, for me, forever more.","For You, For Me, for Evermore"
Jack Doyle,"Maybe it was the music, or the glamorous sky of blue.
Maybe it was the mood I was in or maybe it was really you, really you.

This heart of mine was doing very well.
The world was fine as far as I could tell.
And then quite suddenly I saw you, and I dreamed of gay amor.
At dawn I'll wake up singing sentimental overtures.

This heart of mine is gayly dancing now.
I taste the wine of real romancing now.
Somehow this crazy world has taken on a wonderful design.
As long as life endures, it's yours this heart of mine.

This heart of mine is gayly dancing now.
I taste the wine of real romancing now.
Somehow this crazy world has taken on a wonderful design.
As long as life endures, it's yours this heart of mine.",This Heart of Mine
Jack Erdie & the Insubordinates,"Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play
Dear Prudence, greet the brand new day
The sun is up, the sky is blue
It's beautiful and so are you
Dear Prudence won't you come out to play

Dear Prudence open up your eyes
Dear Prudence see the sunny skies
The wind is low the birds will sing
That you are part of everything
Dear Prudence won't you open up your eyes?

Look around round
Look around round round
Look around

Dear Prudence let me see you smile
Dear Prudence like a little child
The clouds will be a daisy chain
So let me see you smile again
Dear Prudence won't you let me see you smile?

Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play
Dear Prudence, greet the brand new day
The sun is up, the sky is blue
It's beautiful and so are you
Dear Prudence won't you come out to play",Dear Prudence
Jack Evans,"Breaking up is hard to do

When you turned and you walked through that door
It hurts me sore, now
I said it hurts me sore, my darling
When you looked at me and you said, goodbye
You made me cry
I said you made me cry, my darling

So listen to me, what I say to you
Breaking up is hard to do, everybody knows
Breaking up is hard to do

And saying, if you've ever been in love
Then you'll realize just what I'm talking about
Breaking up is so very hard to do
It's hard to do

I cannot let you go now
'Cause my love is so strong
My love is so, strong
I said my love is so, so strong

And if you leave I will surely cry
Breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up is hard to do, everybody knows
Breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up is hard to do",Break Free

DEEP IN MY INNER SELF
BURIED IN ASHES AND STONES
WIND AND RAIN
IN MY SOUL
A FALLEN FAIRY GODMOTHER
IS WAITING FOR THE LIGHT

[REF:]
SO RISE AGAIN
DANCE TO A WALL OF TEARS AND PAIN
RISE UP AGAIN
DANCE TO THE WALL OF TEARS AND PAIN

SHE WILL BE RELEASED
COMING UP
LIKE A GODDESS IN HELL
PLEASE DON'T STOP THE DANCE
BEFORE THE END OF MY TIME

[REF:]
SO RISE AGAIN
DANCE TO A WALL OF TEARS AND PAIN
RISE UP AGAIN
DANCE INTO MY LIFE OF TEARS AND PAIN

Jack Frost,"Lightning smokes on the hillrise
Brought the man with the warning light
Shouting loud ""you had better fly""
While the darkness can help you hide
Trouble's comin' without control
No one's stayin' that's got a hope
Hurricane at the very least
In the words of the gypsy queen

Sign of the gypsy queen
Pack your things and leave
Word of a woman who knows
Take all your gold and you go

Get my saddle and tie it on
Western wind who is fast and strong
Jump on back, he's good and long
We'll resist till we reach the dawn
Running seems like the best offense
Staying just don't make any sense
No one could ever stop it now
Show the cards of the gypsy town

Sign of the gypsy queen
Pack your things and leave
Word of a woman who knows
Take all your gold and you go

Shadows movin' without a sound
From the hold of the sleepless town
Evil seems to be everywhere
Heed the spirit that brought despair
Trouble's comin' without control
No one's stayin' that's got a hope
Hurricane at the very least
In the words of the gypsy queen

Sign of the gypsy queen
Pack your things and leave
Word of a woman who knows
Take all your gold and you go
Sign of the gypsy queen
Pack your things and leave
Word of a woman who knows
Take all your gold and you go

Jack Frost,"They packed us up in boxes, wooden boxes
And sent us home
Underneath the willow, near the the river
By my headstone
And all you do is carry on
It's snowing now it's winter, river's frozen
And still you come
I can almost see you, and touch you
My pretty one
When all you do is carry on",Civil War Lament
Jack Frost,"Well you spoke about amnesia, as though it's where it's at
Your lover had a seizure, while her brother fed her pussycat
You were hanging from the railing, like a flag that's just been torn
You were trying, you were failing, you were screaming through the storm
Didn't know where I was, didn't know where I was
I didn't know my name
Didn't know where I was, didn't know where I was
It all looked the same
By the time I reached Wisconsin, it was looking just like Perth
A damaged doomed Charles Bronson stumbling on this earth
When the carburettors buckled your pistons just went slack
From the time that you were suckled, you were crying through the cracks
There's people in the city, there's witches in the caves
There's matchsticks in the kitty, why can't you behave
Torches search the heavens, it's raining out at sea
Everyone has disappeared you keep telling me
Your cover is blown, your smile is cracked
Your house burned down and that's a fact",Didn't Know Where I Was
Jack Frost,"Yeah, and somebody said, if you really want to get ahead
You can make your bed, but you don't have to lie in it
So keep your bad advice, I listened to it once or twice
I'll just throw the dice and wait a minute
Even as we speak, the headlines of the week
They may be wrong, but I'll be strong
And you belong with me
Yeah, and somebody sang, I don't believe in this whole shebang
The Lutherans rang, and I felt the power
I opened up my arms, walked out underneath the palms
And the car alarms went off every hour
Yeah, and somebody wrote, that it might have been a joke
Or just a mistake, at least that's what I reckon
I threw the windows open, it didn't matter that I was broken
I'm still hoping for something better every second
Even as we speak, the headlines of the week
They may be wrong, but I'll be strong
And you belong with me
Even as we speak, when things become more bleak
They may be wrong, but I'll be strong
And you belong with me
Even as we speak, the passing of another freak
They may be wrong, but I'll be strong
And you belong with me
Even as we speak
They may be wrong
And you belong with me",Even as We Speak
Jack Frost,"So you fly, then you fall
Why'd you learn to walk, when you can crawl
Every hour god sends some wings
Every hour god sends some stones
You steal, and you scheme
You think therefore you are, and you seem
You seem a little nervous, just relax
Just give them all your innocence, you've got stacks
Every hour god sends some wings
Every hour god sends some stones
Now cool out and don't push
Sooner or later they'll give you an ambush
An ambush unexpected, from the blue
I like a little circus, don't you?
Every hour god sends some wings
Every hour god sends some stones
Every hour god sends some eyes
Every hour god sends some nerves
Every hour god sends some luck
Every hour god sends some love
Every hour god sends some light
Every hour god sends some prize
(Hey we're gonna have a jihad)",Every Hour God Sends
Jack Frost,"As you stumble into the future
Remorselessly moving out of the past
And you separate the reflex moments of living
You drag down the morning into your room
You can sing with your partner
You can sing by yourself
You can sing that everything takes forever
You can sing with the vampires
You can sing with the beast
You can sing that everything takes forever
As you sit at the table you make small decisions
You lie in your bed and you laugh at the dark
You ask yourself a hundred dumb questions
And you answer yourself with a hundred dumb lies
(Chorus)
And then tomorrow wake up with a stranger
You drag down the morning into your room
(Chorus)
You can sing in the twilight
You can sing in the morning
You can sing that everything takes forever
You can sing in the orchards
You can sing by the streams
You can sing that everything takes forever
You can sing under stars
You can sing in the graveyard
You can sing that everything takes forever
You can sing in your sunglasses
You can sing by the moon
You can sing that everything takes forever
You can sing with accordians
You can sing with violins
You can sing that everything takes forever
You can sing with the knifethrowers
You can sing with the freaks
You can sing that everything takes forever
You can sing in the avenues
You can sing under starlight
You can sing that everything takes forever
You can sing with the last ones
You can sing with the children
You can sing that everything takes forever",Everything Takes Forever
Jack Frost,"Remember when I told you
You were pretty lost
It seems you had it up to here
You just paid the cost
All I have, all I need, all you got, is providence
You're looking pretty tired
Seems you lost some weight
You made it through, I don't know how
That's what you can do
The plants smell sweet in the frozen air
And their silhouettes just fading there
The wolves crouch close against the snow
But where we're running I don't know
In villages and soft sad towns
The candles sway as night comes down
Cold bones creak and strange beasts cry
Watching shadows in the sky
Remember when we were lovers
The things we used to do
The way the wind came through the door
The way it pulled you through
It was over before we knew it
Gone from both our minds
So if you get the inclination
Just think of me sometime",Providence
Jack Frost,"The very second time I walked in this room
You knew that I was gone
And just the way the sun slanted in
Made it all seem wrong
I know you say you love me
And somewhere I think that you do
I love all the tricks you've shown me
I'll cut myself in two
It's coming on again
So I saw the newspaper that had burnt in the fire
The headlines were rain
Go walk outside and clear my head
Down on Albion Lane
I know you live around here somewhere
As I scan the sky
I know that you sleep around here somewhere
Where it's warm and dry
On Saturday afternoon the crowds rolled in clouds
Ignored the rumors of war
We drink a toast to auld lang syne
Stretched out on the floor
I know you'll never remember
And it's better that way
Let this wine take your memory
Of everything before today
",Ramble
Jack Frost,"Well I saw you at the opening
Somebody's hand was up your dress
You were showing off everything
Except your finesse
Thought that I
Thought that I was over you
Thought that I, thought that I
Thought that I was over you
In a shack one night in Brisbane
You said that I'd just missed my flight
Playing cards, raining hard
And holding on with all my might
Like a firework going off in my mind
I have to say it hurt me seeing you have a good time
I know you're there, you've got new friends
From my point of view, well it depends
I'm sure there was a reason
It's pretty clear to me
If he's got a hold on your heart yeah
I hope he shows some mercy
Can't you hear the phone ringing
Can't you see the train has come
Can't you hear the Seraphim is singing
Devil beating on his drum",Thought That I Was over You
Jack Frost,"I can barely bear to be with you tonight
I can hardy stand to see you in this light
How can I even try to deny it
I can barely bear to be with you tonight
How long will you keep me waiting
I can only hold you in the dream tonight
I won't even think what claims you've made tonight
How can I even try to deny it
I can only hold you in the dream tonight
[Repeat verse 1]",Threshold
Jack Frost,"I hadn't thought about Mrs. Morgan for years, until I read in the paper
That she had died. When I was a boy, Mrs. Morgan played solo with my
Mother every Tuesday afternoon. There were two other women there, but
I can't remember their names anymore. Monkey, Magden, something like that.
Mrs. Morgan collected opals. Her husband Ted owned a circus, which kept
Him away and out of the picture most of the time. I'd come home from
School and the women would be hard at the cards. I liked Mrs. Morgan, she
Always had a little chip of opal for me, and said that I should save it for
A sweetheart. I came home one day and Mrs. Morgan was crying in our kitchen.
My mother told me to leave them alone. I learned later that a boy from the
Circus had fallen and died. He used to ride the trapeze. Mr. Morgan went out
Of business and they moved away. I've still got the opals. It's funny how
Someone you've never met manages to stay with you.",Trapeze Boy
Jack Garratt,"Speak and open up your mind
It's something you should do all the time
Keep exploring, seek and find
You know you might surprise yourself
Talk without a taint or hold
The doubts that should embrace your heart
The calm and chaos of your soul
You know you might surprise yourself

Take a pen and write this down
Draw something that can't be found
And learn to walk again somehow
You know you might surprise yourself",Surprise Yourself [GRYFFIN x Manila Killa Remix]
Jack Garratt,"Bad times are coming, coming
Good friends are gone
And my eyes keep hoping, hoping
To tell need most?
My faults were full and plenty
And yours tore me up
So it's no wonder I'm thinking really
You're better off
You're better off

And I didn't want you anyway
Don't need reminding I'm yours mistake
No, I couldn't want you anyway
Not anymore
Not anymore

Don't keep the fire burning
When the colds dead and gone
And wait until the warmth starts skipping
And the flames are gone
And the flames are gone

And I didn't want you anyway
Don't need reminding I'm yours mistake
No, I couldn't want you anyway
Not anymore
Not anymore

Don't keep my hope in darkness
Let my mind digress
I know your broken heart has laid my lives to rest
But I didn't want you anyway
No, I couldn't want you anyway
I couldn't want you anyway
Not anymore
Not anymore",I Couldn't Want You Anyway
Jack Garratt,"Let me be something you use up
For one night
Burn the remnants of my youth in
Fire and light
Pull me apart and I will fade
Spill out the truths I've learnt

I am gone
I am remnants pouring from the pyres, pyres
They keep me young
Keep my remnants pouring from the pyres, pyres

I'm too weak to carry you
And I will fall
Into the pyres, burning resurrection from the embers
I'll stand tall
And you'd only weight me down

I am gone
I am remnants pouring from the pyres, pyres
They keep me young
Keep my remnants pouring from the pyres, pyres

By the sounds of women I'll never meet

Jack Garratt,"My love is overdone, selfish and domineering
It won’t sit up on the shelf
So don’t try to reason with my love
My love is powerful, ruthless and unforgiving
It won’t think beyond itself
So don’t try to reason with my love
And when you pray, he will not answer
Although you may hear voices on your mind
They won’t be kind

My love won’t reason
Loosen up the chains that bound you
Don’t try to reason with my love

My love is chemical, shallow and chauvinistic
It’s an arrogant display
So don’t try to reason with my love
And when you pray, he will not answer
I know this for I ask him all the time
To reassure my mind

My love won’t reason
Loosen up the chains that bound you
My love won’t reason
Break away the walls surrounding you

Free you from the pain you’re captive by

Talk without a taint or hold

You know you might surprise yourself

Take a pen and write this down
Draw something that can't be found
And learn to walk again somehow
You know you might surprise yourself

And tears me from a place I know

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

And through foggy London town,

And your path is free to walk

And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
And for hours, you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence, tears of joy might stain my face
And a summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

I dipped my cup of soap
Back from a gurglin', cracklin' caltron in some train yard
My beard, a roughen coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled down across my face

Through cupped hands around a tin can

Jack Greene,"I went to church this morning and heard you say a prayer
You didn't even notice that I was standing there
I heard you whisper softly dear God in heaven above
Forgive me please for hurting the one you know I love
If God can forgive you so can I you were not the only one to cry
When you went away dear I've thought that I would die
If God can forgive you so can I
And when the prayer was over I sat there quietly
The teardrops slowly falling I knew them suddenly
You had been forgiven I felt it in my heart
What God has joined together let no man tear apart

By your side I will stay till we're old and gray reminiscing young moments we knew
If my heart had windows you'd see a heart full of love just for you

About the years ahead and how they'll be
You'll be living in a world where roses hardly ever grow

And there'll be no fancy clothes for you to wear
Everything I have is standing here in front of you to see all I have to offer you is me

Jack Greene,"But you know I love you oh I love you
When the morning sun streaks across my room
And I'm wakened up from another dream of you
Yes I'm on the road once again it seems
And all I've left behind is a chain of broken dreams
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you
How I wish that love is all we'd need to live
What a life we'd have cause I've got so much to give
And it seems so wrong and it breaks my heart
To know the dollar sign is all that's keeping us apart
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you
And if only I could find my way back to the time
When the problems of this life had not yet crossed our minds
All the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come running back to you
But you know we can't live on dreams alone
And to pay the rent I must leave you all alone
But I had to I make my choice many years ago
And now this traveling life is the only life I know
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you

Jack Greene,"Your mem'ry always brings out the fool in me
I can't deny I love you more than life
But so many times before I should have said goodbye
Still I know I'll never be completely free
There's something holding on to you it's the fool in me
I've tried to keep my feelings for you locked up tight
But the thoughts I have of you just won't be denied
And no one knows that you remain my destiny
Until I grow too weak and they see the fool in me
Yes the fool in me keeps hanging on to you
Even after all this hurtin' that you can't be through
And I can't escape the past I know I can't be free
Cause your mem'ry always brings out the fool in me
Yes your mem'ry always brings out the fool in me

Jack Greene,"You look so lovely lying there with dreamland's grin up on your face
Your golden curls in disarray upon your starched white pillow case
The soft blue satin covers pulled up tight around your lovely throat
It almost makes me want to go destroy the message on the note

The note I wrote upon your perfumed stationary by the phone
I hate to think about you waking up at dawn to find me gone
It's hard for me to get up in the middle of the night and go
But thinking back I do remember faintly that I told you so

I told you I was like a bird a free and wild and restless thing
And even though I take a mate and build a nest in early spring
When summer winds have had their day and winter clouds're flyin' high
Instinctively I spread my wings and fly

I only know why but I must go and nothing here must hold me back
I like the love you gave me and the tender way you scratched my back
I like your warm sweet kisses and the way you cook your ham and eggs
I like the way the suntan lotion softened up your lovely legs
I like the static noise I heard when you would sit and brush your hair

The way you gave yourself to me and never asked to go nowhere
But most of all I like the way you always smiled and never frowned
The way you took this chance for love and took me just for what I am
I told you I was like a bird...

And now my darling as I leave I fight the yearning in my blood
To wake you up and love you just once more before I go for good
But somehow I am fighting back my passion for I cannot stay
And someday you'll look back and know best it ended up this way
I told you I was like a bird...

Jack Greene,"A canvas covered cabin in a crowded labor camp stands out in this mem'ry I revive
'Cause my daddy raised a family there with two hard working hands
And tried to feed my mama's hungry eyes
He dreamed of something better and my mama's faith was strong

And us kids were just too young to realize
That another class of people put us somewhere just below
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes
Mama never had the luxuries she wanted but it wasn't cause my daddy didn't try

She only wanted things she really needed

Since my true love walked out the door
Tears I never had before
Ribbon of darkness over me

Clouds are gathering over my head
They chill the day and hide the sun
And shroud the night when day is done

Rain is falling on the meadow
Where once my love and I did lie
Now she's gone from the meadow
My love goodbye

Ribbon of darkness over me
Where once the world was young as spring
Where clouds bloom and birds would sing

In this cold room lying, I don't want to see no one but you
Lord, I wish I could be dying to forget you
Oh, how I wish, your heart could see my mind
Just takes the breaks of day

Will tell me that you love me anytime I need to know

And the staggering years with their own barren fears
And the rose hips double-edged truth

In the clear moon light
Without fear, insomnia

Gettin' stress, makin' excess mess in darkness
No electricity, something's all over me, greasy
Insomnia please release me and let me dream of
Makin' mad love to my girl on the heath
Tearin' off tights with my teeth
But there's no release, no peace
I toss and turn without cease
Like a curse, open my eyes and rise like yeast
At least a couple of weeks
Since I last slept, kept takin' sleepers
But now I keep myself pepped
Deeper still, that night I write by candle light
I find insight, fundamental movement, uh
So when it's back this insomniac take an original tack
Keep the beast in my nature under ceaseless attack
I gets no sleep

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep

To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step

Jack Ingram,"A young man drivin' down a dusty road
Like he's got somewhere to go
Driving like he's got a destination
Like he's got somewhere to go in that beat up ford

See there was a time when he was a young lost soul
He was chasin' butterflies and rainbows
Until one day when he found his pot of gold
In the words of the young man he turned old
And the old man said

[Chorus]
You gotta have a good imagination
If your gonna live the life of old
He said you've got to drive that Ford like its a stallion
And you've got to wear your heart just like a gun
The old man said, the old man said

The boy walked out with a new found hero
Yea the boy well he walked away a man
And he said to himself that dusty day way down in Texas
Well I'm never gonna walk this path again
And the old man said

[Chorus]

The boy walked out he was dreaming of wild times
When old cowboys and broke down cattle lines
Now those fields are all but gone
But his heart's still free and he rides on

Don't know how it started, all I know is it's got to end
I've got a noose around my neck and I don't know why

I followed you to Detroit City then down to New Orleans
Trail after trail with nothing but a bottle of too old gin
Don't know where you lead me all I know is I've got to go
Gotta find you babe, before I'm too old

With all these loving you things
Don't know how I'll get by

I didn't put up a fight just to find me one more start
Now it's taken me out of my home and put me out on the street
This loving you thing has got me beat

An old film playing at the show
He could tell by the clouds up top
And old northern was about to blow

So he hopped in his pick-up truck
Steered it on down the road
There he picked up his dark-haired beauty
Drove on down nice and slow, singing

This is my girl
This is my world
This is my girl
This is my world

A lovers' tune on the stereo
Cool breeze blowin' through her hair
He whispers to her soft and low
And quietly she stares

He says I know I could be a movie star
I know that you could be my wife
I was thinking at work today
I wanna leave with you tonight, because

You are my girl
You are my world
You are my girl
(You are my girl)
You are my world

Wishing on stars as they go

Taking off to God knows where

Jack Ingram,"Sherry was a waitress at the only joint in town.
She had a reputation as a girl who'd been around.
On Main street after midnight, a brand new pack of cig's,
A fresh one hanging from her lips, a beer between her legs.
She'd ride down to the river, and meets with all her friends.
The road goes on forever and the party never ends.

Sonny was a loner, he was older than the rest.
He was goin' in the Navy, but could not pass the test.
So he hung around town, he sold a little pot.
The law caught wind of Sonny and one day he got caught.
But he was back in business when they set him free again.
The road goes on forever and the party never ends.

Sonny's playin' eight-ball at the joint where Sherry works
When some drunken out-of-towner put his hand up Sherry's skirt.
Sonny took his pool cue, laid the drunk out on the floor.
Stuffed a dollar in her tip jar, and he walked on out the door.
She's running right behind him, reaching for his hand.
The road goes on forever and the party never ends.

They jumped into the pickup, Sonny jammed it down in gear.
Sonny looked at Sherry, and said let's get on out of here.
The stars were high above them, the moon was in the east.
The sun was setting on them when they reached Miami Beach.
They got a hotel by the water, and a quart of Bombay Gin.
The road goes on forever and the party never ends.

They soon ran out of money but, Sonny he knew a man,
Who knew some Cuban refugees, who dealt in contraband.
Sonny met the Cubans in a house just off the route,
With a briefcase full of money and a pistol in his boot.
The cards were on the table when the law came bustin' in.
The road goes on forever and the party never ends.

The Cubans grabbed the goodies, and Sonny he grabbed the jack
He broke the bathroom window and climbed on out the back.
Sherry drove the pickup down an alley on the side,
Where a lawman tackled Sonny and was reading him his rights.
She stepped out in the alley with a single shot four-ten
The road goes on forever and the party never ends.

They left the lawman dying they made their getaway.
They got back to the motel just before the break of day.
Sonny gave her all the money, he blew her a little kiss.
If they ask you how this happened say I forced you into this.
She watched him as his taillights disappeared around the bend.
The road goes on forever and the party never ends.

Its main street after midnight, just like it was before,
Twenty-one months later, at the local grocery store.
Sherry buys a paper and a cold six-pack of beer.
The headlines say that Sonny well he's going to the chair.
She pulls back onto Main Street in her new Mercedes Benz.
The road goes on forever and the party never ends.",The Road Goes on Forever

He forgot the times before the war
There was a girl he could have called his wife

He plays guitar on the corner some
Not enough to be a star
But it's enough just to have some fun
And make some people happy awhile

I don't have enough to pay your fare

And they're looking for an able bodied man

In a letter that I mailed two days ago
But when I wrote the letter saying
You could come to me I didn't know

That I was going to lose my job in such a little while
So now we're going to have to change our plans
They may not hire me in Columbus but I'm pretty sure they will
'Cause they're looking for an able bodied man

I'd have made a better life for me and you
But such simple manual labor
Is the only kind of work that I can do

Jack Ingram,"Well, it's Friday night, Mary's lookin' fancy
Got her red dress on, she must be goin' dancin' on the town
That Mary goes round
Everybody knows her all over town

Well, I wanted to dance, so I walked up and asked her
We were on that floor
She said, ""Faster, faster, come on, cowboy
Let Mary Go Round""
Everybody knows me all over town as Mary Go Round

[Chorus]
I can do the do the two step, I can do-si-do
I can even do the damned ol' cotton eyed Joe
I can do the waltz and I can spin around
I can keep up with any man in town

We were all alone, I thought I'd take this little girl
Back to my home and fool around with Mary Go Round
And everybody knows her all over town

Jack Ingram,"My old man, he had a ramblin' soul 
He'd hear an old freight train and he had to roll 
Said he'd been blessed with a gypsy bone 
That's the reason I guess he'd been cursed to roam 
 
He came to town back before the war 
He didn't even know that it was he was looking for 
He carried a tattered bag for his violin 
It was full of songs from places he had been 
  
He talked real easy, had a smilin' way 
He could pass it on to you while his fiddle played 
He was makin' people drop their cares and woes 
They'd hum out loud to tunes that his fiddled bowed 
  
The people there began to join that sound 
Everyone in town was laughin', singin', dancin' round 
Like the fiddler's tunes were all they heard that night 
As if some dream had said all in the world was right 
  
His eye caught a dancing lady there 
She had that rollin', flowin', golden, danglin' kind of hair 
He played for her as if she danced alone 
He played his favorite songs, the ones he called his own 
  
She alone was dancing in the room 
The only thing left moving to his fiddler's tune 
He played until she was the last to go 
He stopped and packed his case and said he'd take her home 
  
In all the nights that passed, a child was born 
And all the years that passed, love would keep them warm 
All their lives they've shared a dream come true 
All because she danced so well to his fiddler's tune 
  
But the train next morning, she blew a lonesome sound 
As if she sang the blues of what she took from town 
All that I recall he said when I was young 
Was no one else could really sing the songs he sung",My Old Man
Jack Ingram,"Bill lights a cigarette
Thinkin' that it might do him some good
Tammy comes over and sits right down beside

Billy's just another boy
He's from the other side of the tracks

But he's not so sure that she will lay down

Well she put up a fight

Well, Billy he's acting cool'
So he smirks a soft one
Say's ""darlin' that's real neat""

Think I'll go downtown 
But me a beer and drink myself 
Into next week

Billy rolls a crooked one
Ya he's gonna smoke it 
And see where he can go
He's gonna lie out in an open field
And he don't give a damn
About the rain, the sleet or the snow

He's gonna leave this town behind him
Where he lands, baby, nobody knows
Nobody cares, nobody gives a damn
About the little boy down in Texas

Well the wind's gonna start to rumble
And those tumble weeds are going to roll
Well, that's when we're gonna to catch the next train to Boulder
We're gonna get out and take a long look around

Jack Ingram,"Another Tuesday night
In the rain
Another day gone by

I thought I knew the plan

Late nights in my car
Late nights chasing you
Wherever you were

Maybe those were the days
And those were my nights

So dim those lights

And even when I dream at night
I cannot see your face

You cheering for me

Jack Ingram,"I found myself down at the Airways Motel
Drunk and half hearted again
Alone with a woman who's not gonna tell
What I've been doin' and where I have been
It seems Sunday mornings, they come without warning
I'm never ready for the way that I feel
I'm so sick of lying, I know that I'm dying
From all of these secrets that I can't reveal

But I can still sing along with the choir
While I fight through my own private hell
Caught between heaven and all my desire
For the girl at the Airways Motel

When I promised forever the night that I married
I meant every word that I said
But a couple years later I stand here a liar
Next to the woman I know I've misled

Looking around at this whole congregation
Too tired to listen, I play with my ring
I wonder who all of us think that we're fooling
Hiding from someone who sees everything

She can't clear the picture from her eyes
Of leaving that little girl behind

But she's gonna find a daddy here
And her little girl?s gonna come here too
But just like every other dream so far
She knows that one probably won't come true

And you can see it in her smile looking at her eyes
Yeah, that's right, she keeps her smile when she's about to cry
And I think she knows the truth but she whispers faith
And Inna?s friends back home, think she's got it made

So every week she sends some money home
She says things here going well
She doesn't let the tears touch the page
And stain the letter all to hell

I met Inna at a grocery store
We were waiting in line
I asked her who the Barbie doll was for
You'd thought that I had asked her who died

So I started to apologize
Man, I was just trying to kill some time
But I still can't get Inna from my mind
But I will never look behind

?Cause I can see it in her smile looking at her eyes
Yeah, that's right, she keeps her smile when she's about to cry
And I think she knows the truth but she whispers faith
And Inna?s friend's back home, think she's got it made

Yes, I think she knows the truth but she whispers faith
Inna?s friend's back home, they think she's got it made

Jack Ingram,"Well, I know that you'll see her before I do
'Cause she told me I never would again
But I've got to get a message to her somehow
So I'm asking you this favor as a friend

If you see Juanita ask her for me
Why she's holding on to something that I need
If you see Juanita ask her nicely
Won't she please bring back my heart to me

She can keep all my Willie Nelson records
She can have my velvet poster of the king
She can keep almost everything she's taken
?Cause I all I really want is just one thing

If you see Juanita ask her for me
Why she's holding on that something that I need
If you see Juanita ask her nicely
Won't she please bring back my heart to me

If you see Juanita ask her for me
Why she's holding on that something that I need
If you see Juanita ask her nicely

And she's got a fast car so you know I like that
While I'm never asked to pay for gas
If it should happen I could fix a flat

It's one rare moment she don't know what to do
Now I know that don't seem like much

Maybe there might not be someone else

Comin' to my house and taking me home
There's only one reason she don't stay
It's 'cause I work so damn hard to push her away

Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on
It's really good to hear your voice
Sayin' my name
It sounds so sweet
Comin' from the lips of an angel
Hearin' those words
It makes me weak
And I
Never want to say goodbye
But, girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It's really good to hear your voice
Sayin' my name

Jack Ingram,"Happy happy, country, country 
Somethin' snappy Somethin' funny 
Make 'em laugh, make 'em have a good time 
Don't make 'em lonely cause it makes 'em cry 

Just give 'em happy, happy, country, country 
That's what they want, man to feel that funky 
Happy country music's gonna make 'em think everything 
Is gonna be all right      

So many people feelin afraid 
It looks like everybody's got it made 
So many others feelin' alone 
Got no one to love 'em when they get home 
 
Give em: 
Chorus 
 
They go to the bar to get away 
From all the problems of everyday 
Don't need another tear in my beer 
I got enough problems, don't bring them here 

Happiness and love that's lost 
We all want it and we pay the cost 
But tonight let me get away 
And talkin' to the people, the people say

Jack Ingram,"Hey, this Jack, thanks for buyin' ""Live Wherever you are""
A collection of songs we did live 
At Green Hall at the historic dance hall in Green Texas
A place where my musical heroes grew up, guess what, 
so did I I love this live record 
And I've also got some studio stuff on here that I wanna play for ya
The first ones called ""Wherever you are"", a song I did with Jeremy Stover

It's song about gettin' to where it is you need to be
Doin' what you have to do, to get where you're supposed to be
In this case it's goin' through the storms, through the sleet
Through the rain, through the wind, doin' whatever it takes
To get ""Wherever you are""",Hello
Jack Ingram,"Dang this sun dang this day
Yea I'm just tryin' to stay out of your danged ole way
The heck with this the heck with us
Shoot if I'll ever look back on where I've been
Shoot if I'll ever get away my heart again

Love you love this town
Love this mother loving truck
Keeps on breaking loving down
There's only one little four letter word that will do
Love you

Love your cat love this house
I can't believe myself that I'm loving getting' out
Love talking love fighting
And the thought of never seeing your loving face
Well there's some words that some words just have to replace

So love you love this town
I'm sick and loving tired of all you're loving around
There's only one four letter word that will do

The next great white hope
Not just another pretender
Not just the next big joke

You had to reach for the stars though

Without playin' a game, son
You're gonna take a fall

You've never knocked me down
You've never knocked me down
You've never knocked me down

You don't get nothin' for nothin'
Ain't that what they all say
We're all fightin' for somethin'
But there's a price to pay

Yeah, you can stand there forever
Just take it blow by blow
Nobody else is the wiser
They just came for the show

You've never knocked me down
You've never knocked me down
You've never knocked me down
You've never knocked me down

There is a shadow of doubt
Go on, pretend you're a winner
Go on, sell yourself out

And I know it's you that I'm waiting on
And that sweet promise of our first kiss
Keeps me hanging on, through times like this

So wherever you are, I'm thinking of you
I wonder if you're thinking of me, too
There's only so long, time can keep up apart
So until we meet, keep me in your heart
Keep wishing upon that same ol' star
And know that I love you, wherever you are

Can't say I know what you look like 
But you're in my heart, you're on my mind
And I feel your love deep down in my soul
When I finally find you, I'll just know

So wherever you are, I'm thinking of you
I wonder if you're thinking of me, too
There's only so long, time can keep up apart
So until we meet, keep me in your heart
Keep wishing upon that same ol' star

Keep wishing upon that same ol' star
And know that I love you, wherever you are

God I'm missin' you
Been runnin' blind under a broken sky
With regrets I was sorting through
But lesson learned baby
I've made the turn

Wherever you are
No matter how far
Girl I'm gonna find my way to you
Through rivers of rain
Over mountains of pain
Do whatever on earth I've gotta do
I'll follow the dream I'll follow my heart
Girl I've gotta be
Wherever you are

So many miles to where we said goodbye
To the street of shattered dreams
I'm prayin' hard you didn't start a life
With someone who's not me
And if you're just gone
Girl I'll be movin' on

Let the sunrise find me searchin'
Let the west wind carry my plea
Give this changed man one more last chance
Open your arms to me

Jack Ingram,"I always believed and followed
Trusted in things, relied on faith
Faith let me down in hollow
Now, I have found another way

All I can do is what you want me to do, but I don't
And all I can say is what you want me to say, but I won't
All I can prove to you is I got nothing left to prove to you
Truth is that anything for you is all I can do

Everything is an empty promise
All that you say are lies to me
Silver and gold, shiny polish
It ain't worth anything if it ain't what you need

All I can do is what you want me to do, but I don't
All I can say is what you want me to say, but I won't
All I can prove to you is I got nothing left to prove to you
But at the end of every day, blinded by the truth
Anything for you is all I can do

It?s all I can do
It?s all I can do
It?s all I can do

All I can prove to you is I got nothing left to prove to you

You are the one for me

But I'm already way gone
In the eyes, Ava Adele

And I know that I
I ain't the first guy to take one look
At a beautiful girl and declare
That my search is through, I say this to you
I found love in Ava Adele

And I searched low and high
Never did find one thing worth dyin' for
But I'd fall to the ground
I'd go all the way down
Fightin', Ava Adele

And I know that I
I ain't the first guy to take one look

Jack Ingram,"I look around and all I see is people
Trying to find a reason
If this world can hand out such a beatin'
And they don't wanna hurt anymore

When we were young it all seemed to be easy
Everything within reach
One broken heart and we're retreatin'
'Cause we don't wanna hurt anymore

Don't want to, don't want to
Don't want to hurt anymore

But you look at me and you say you feel sorry
But you never understood
And you never knew the things I wanted
I just don't wanna hurt anymore

I keep trying to explain myself and figure
Why bother what's the use
I finally realized that all that matters is
I don't wanna hurt anymore

Don't want to, don't want to
Don't want to hurt anymore

I look around and all I see is people
Trying to find a reason

The other day you should've heard my girl

She said you better find a way to loving this world
As it baby you know I'm just dying to

Something simple and not for me
I need something that make me feel better
Something as easy as 1, 2, 3, something as easy as 1, 2, 3

Why's it got to be so damn complicated

I walk outside and I stare at the sky
In sight of second a star shoots by
And I think to myself, man what a lucky guy
And blink and I would've missed it

I need something that make me feel better

Jack Ingram,"We still listen to high school football
On the radio in West Texas
Lights to shine bright every Friday night
And you can drive ninety miles an hour
Down the highway straight to ' Cisco
The cops are at the ball game, they're getting tight

And the sky gets wider and wider
It disappear like the day
Into the great divide you fade away

And it's another world all together
Right in the middle of God's country
Smells like money, smells like shit
Yeah, it smells like hell

But when the cattle's all together
And the pump jacks all are moving
And the [cartons] are in blooming
It smells like nothing else

And the sky gets wider and wider
Just like a brand new day
Out in the great divide you fade away

It's the land of my people
My dream is come out here to find a bigger piece of sky
It's all the winners and all the losers
Real good people but just like you and I

Hey, but nothing's really changed much
As you drive on down at twenty
Mexicans still work out in the field

But everybody's dirty
Man they're all a bunch of gamblers
But some got rich
Yeah, but they're gamblers still

And the sky gets wider and wider
The day's gonna be your day
Out in the great divide you fade away

And it's the land of my people
My dream is come out here to find a bigger piece of sky

Jack Ingram,"I've been following your ghost
Running circles 'round this house
Tripping over memories
Trying to figure things out
It's been a few years and I miss you still
Get your picture on the window sill
Been thinking of ways, I got days to fill
I don't think I ever will

CHORUS
Hold on to things you can't explain
Hold on dancing in the rain
Hold on to kisses on the lips
Savor every sweet moment, cause baby this is it
And hold on
Hold on

I've been cleaning up this mess
Found a metal box with some black and white photographs
A little faded but baby you sure do look good in that old dress, oh yes
Didn't we wish we were superstars?
Sign our names in the dust on your family car
We'd be waving to the crowd
You be the diva
And I'll play guitar

CHORUS
Hold on to things you wanna be
Hold on to friends and family
Hold on to burning summer sun
It makes a difference, every one
Hold on

Thinking that we'd say the same
But we didn't know that the world would change
Yeah it just keeps on spinning
And we just keep on holding on

Start the car and call the road your friend
Tell the girls and the Lord above
You'll think fondly and call back now and then

Head out of the city
Go find what they brought you down here for
Take that shiny penny
That daddy gave you from the day that you were born

And make a wish that dreams come true
Go on sail the ocean blue
Ride a highway like the wind
Drink the good times down like sin
Go on, take that car and drive so far
It looks like you're comin' home again

Stare at the moonlight
And threaten every star it won't be long
You tell 'em this is the very last night
I look to you to make sense of it all

Then head into the city
Electric lights that shine from dusk till dawn
Take that rusty penny
Throw it in the air and then move along

And make a wish that dreams come true
Go on sail the ocean blue
Ride a highway like the wind
Drink the good times down like sin
Go on, take that car and drive so far

Tore up the tracks and then some

Well, I burned those wheels down the highway
And I learned what I learned the hard way

Work hard for the money in your hands
That's the measure of a man

Anger burns, love cools it down
Pretty young woman turned my head around
The world through her eyes looked so different
She lives on faith, she looks for forgiveness

She stole my heart on this highway
She taught me to love through the hard days
Yeah, she's cool when I'm not; she's as steady as a rock
She's as solid as the ring on my hand

It killed me to do it, but I picked up the phone

Jack Ingram,"How many times have I been face down
Drowing in the bottom of a bottle
Tryin' to get up 
Only knocked me to me knees

And how many times have I flown around this world
Tryin' to find something that I really wanted
But I didn't need
Come here girl

I need to tell you something
Nothing matters more than what is right in front of me
All my searchin' finally found me 
Where I needed to be

Took a whole lot of flying
A whole lot of falling
And damn near drowning
And you, not giving up on me

God knows how many times 
I've begged and pleaded
For one more second chance
Only you know how many times
You gave it to me

And the grace it takes
To let a man make
The mistakes that he's gotta make
When you already knew the way

Come here baby
I must've been half crazy

Nothing matters more than what is right in front of me
All my searchin' finally found me
Where I needed to be

What got me to where I am
What made me a better man

I love you
For not givin' up on me

Jack Ingram,"Saw a story on the local news last night
About one more struggling single mother
She was talking about how hard it is getting by
With no help, no money, no nothing from the baby's father
Made me think about this guy I know with a wife and a child
Who's working two jobs just to get by
Yeah, he says he'd do anything he could in this world
Just to give his young family a better life; yeah, a better life

Oh, that's a man
That's a 19-year-old, modern-day hero man

Those two young marines over there fighting for their country
Man, they're gonna be friends forever
They've both come back eventually
But as bonds and destiny would have it
They don't come back together
Yeah, the one who lived to tell about it
Why he can't even talk about it
Keeps fighting that fight up there in his head
Ain't a day goes by he don't wonder why
Why it wasn't me instead
It could've been me instead

Oh, that's a man
That's a you don't know how hard he tried to save his buddy's life man

I don't know about you
But sometimes, I just need a little reminder
When I've been walking through this world
With blinders on, yes I have
You know it'd never hurt a man
To try and be a better man
And reach down and find some understanding
Find some kind of kindness

Read about a man who said his family
Had been farming the same land in Ohio for 100 years
Felt like he'd paid for it ten times over
With his own blood, his own sweat, and his own tears
If he had to, he'd be out there on that tractor working
Seven long, hot days a week
Yeah, he's the kind of feller that people get real quiet
When he stands up in church to speak
They know when he speaks

Jack Jenney,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

I'm no longer one of those guys
As sure as I live, this love that I give
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth

Away in a manger
No crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus
Lay down His sweet head
The stars in the sky
Look down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay
Asleep on the hay

O holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us

Jack Jezzro,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more

Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

But the fire is so delightful

And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low

How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight

Jack Jezzro,"That certain night
The night we met
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

I may be right I may be wrong
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square

The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love
The whole damned world seemed upside down

The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square

How strange it was
How sweet and strange
There was never a dream to compare
To those hazy crazy nights we met
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

Ah this heart of mine
Loud and fast
Like a merry-go-round in a fair
We would dance cheek to cheek
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

The dawn came stealing up
All gold and blue
To interrupt our rendez-vous
I still remember how you smiled and said
Was that a dream or was it true?

Our homeward step was just as light
As the dancing feet of Astaire
And like an echo far away
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

That night in Berkeley square.",A  Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square

That her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes
On the feet of a queen of the hearts of the cards
And her feet are all covered with tar balls and scars
It's as common as something that nobody knows
That her beauty will follow wherever she goes
Up the hill in the back of her house
In the world she love me forever,
I know she could

I remember when you and me mmm how we used to be just good friends
Wouldn't give me none
But all I wanted was some
She's got a whole lot of reasons
She can't think of a single one
That can justify leaving
And he got none but he thinks he got so many problems
Man he got, too much time to waste

You go with the flow
You don't stop
Move like a jellyfish

That just won't tick

I want to wake up
From this concussion

And all that tension between his gears man

And if heaven was below
He'd know just where to go
Dive in the ocean

Lift him up to see what you can see

He's aiming at you

And now he has cutaways from memories
And close-ups of anything that
He has seen or even dreamed
And now he's finished focusing

He's imagining lightning
Striking sea sickness
Away from here

Look who's laughing now that you've wasted
How many years and you've barely even tasted
Anything remotely close to
Everything you've boasted about
Look who's crying now

Incoming tide touches roots to expose them

As if they'd never even heard it before
And maybe they were truly amused

Because the news was spread all over town

Suggestions on what to believe

I got a stranger's friend

And now that its gone well of course we assume
That somebody else needed something so bad
They took everything that somebody had

Losing hope is easy
When your only friend is gone
And every time you look around
Well, it all, it all just seems to change

Make sure that you aim
Open windows with passing cars
A brand new night
With the same old stars

When your only friend is gone
And every time you look around
Well, it all, it all just seems to change

Feed the fool
A piece of the pie
Make a fool of his system
Make a fool of his mind
Give him bottles of lies
And maybe he'll find
His place in heaven
'Cause he might just die

He gets his courage from the can
It makes him feel like a man

He's only stuck on himself

There just ain't no truth left at all

Riding with the boys and pushing the luck 
Singing songs loud on the way to the game

Chinese home runs over the backstop

Been raining all night so everybody knows 
Over to the field for tackle football 
Big hits, big hats, yeah give me the ball

We're talking kinda funny from helium

Wet trunks and schoolbooks and sand on my toes 
Do anything you can to dodge the bus-stop blues 
Like driving a padiddle with a burnt-out fuse

So meet her by the sugar mill after school

What about your soul?
Is it cold?
Is it straight from the mold and ready to be sold?

Those are only removable things
What about your mind, does it shine?
Or are there things that concern you more than your time?

Gone
Goin'
Gone everything
Gone give a damn
Gone be the birds when they don't want to sing
Gone people all awkward with their things
Gone

Look at you out to make a deal
You try be appealing but you lose your appeal
What about those shoes you're in today?
They'll do no good on the bridges you brought along the way, oh
You willing to sell anything, gone with your head
Leave your footprints, well shame them with our words

Jack Johnson,"The air was more than human
And the heat was more than hungry
And the cars were square and spitting
Diesel fumes

The bulls were running wild
Because they're big and mean and sacred
And the children were playing cricket with no shoes

The next morning we woke up, man
With a seven-hour drive
Well there we were stuck in Port Blair
Where boats break and children stare

And there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven
And there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven

Disembarking from the port
With no mistakes of any sort
Moving south the engine running smooth

Officials were quite friendly
Once we drowned them with our sweet talk
And we bribed them with our cigarettes and booze

The next morning we woke up man
With the sunrise to right
Moving back north to Port Blair
Where boats break and children stare

And there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven
Yes, and there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven",Holes to Heaven

The children's laughter sang 
And skipping just like the stones they threw 
Their voices echoed across the waves 
It's getting late 

And it was just another night 
With a sunset and a moonrise 
Not too far behind to give us just enough light 
To lay down underneath the stars 
We listened to Papa's translations 
Of the stories across the sky 
We drew our own constellations 

The west winds often last too long 
And when they calm down, nothing ever feels the same 
Sheltered under the Kamani tree 
Waiting for the passing rain 
Clouds keep moving to uncover the sea 
Stars up above us chasing the day away 
To find the stories that we sometimes need 
Listen close enough and all else fades 
Fades away 

And it was just another night 
With a sunset and a moonrise 
Not so far behind to give us just enough light 
To lay down underneath the stars 
Listen to all translations 
Of the stories across the sky 
We drew our own constellations",Constellations [Acoustic Version]
Jack Johnson,"Girl I wanna lay you down Jack johnson 
I come over early in the morning
I'm like a heat wave, without warning
And when I touch you my heart begins to flutter
'cause you're smooth and creamy like peanut butter

Girl I wanna lay you down
I said girl I wanna lay you down 



I'm gonna flood you, like a love river
Awe baby the post man, is about to deliver
Cook you up some dinner, a little pasta
Listen to some music, a little Rasta

I said girl I wanna lay you down, 
I said girl I wanna lay you down,
(Girl I wanna lay you down)
Aww baby baby
Don't you no I need your love!

So turn out the lights, bring out the candles,
Wrap your arms around my love handles,
They say the passion may not always endure,
But this feeling that I have for you is burning up my world

girl I wanna lay you down oooohhh
I said girl I wanna lay you down
Girl I wanna lay you down
I said Girl I wanna lay you down
I said Girl I wanna lay you down
Girl I wanna lay you down

Jack Johnson,"Can't you see that it's just rainin'
Ain't no need to go outside

But baby
You hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song is meant to keep you
Doin' what you're supposed to
Wakin' up too early
Maybe we could sleep in
Make you banana pancakes
Pretend like its the weekend now
We could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just rainin'
There ain't no need to go outside

Just maybe
Halaka ukulele mama made a baby
Really don't mind the practice
Cause you're my little lady
Lady lady love me
Cause I love to lay here lazy
We could close the curtains
Pretend like there's no world outside
We could pretend it all the time
And can't you see that it's just rainin'
There ain't no need to go outside

Ain't no need ain't no need
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Can't you see can't you see
Rain all day and I don't mind

But the telephone's singing ringing
It's too early don't pick it up
We don't need to
We got everything we need right here
And everything we need is enough
Just so easy when the whole world fits inside of your arms
Do we really need to pay attention to the alarm
Wake up slow
Mmm wake up slow

But baby
You hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song is meant to keep you
From doin' what your supposed to
Wakin' up too early
Maybe we could sleep in
Make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now
We could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just rainin'
There ain't no need to go outside
Ain't no need, ain't no need

Jack Johnson,"There is no combination of words I could put on the back of a postcard
No song that I could sing, but I can try for your heart
Our dreams, and they are made out of real things
Like a, shoe box of photographs
With sepia-toned loving
Love is the answer, at least for most of the questions in my heart
Like why are we here? And where do we go?
And how come it's so hard?
It's not always easy and
Sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing, it's always better when we're together

It's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look at the stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments
Just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings
And brings new things
For tomorrow night you see
That they'll be gone too
Too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way
Into my day to day scene
I'd be under the impression
I was somewhere in between
With only two
Just me and you
Not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be
We'll sit beneath the mango tree now

Yeah, it's always better when we're together
We're somewhere in between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

I believe in memories
They look so, so pretty when I sleep
Hey now, and when I wake up,
You look so pretty sleeping next to me
But there is not enough time,
And there is no, no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better together",Better Together
Jack Johnson,"I hope this old train breaks down
Then I could take a walk around
See what there is to see
Time is just a melody

With all the people in the street
Walk as fast as their feet
Can take them
I just roam through town

And though my window's got a view
Where the frame I'm looking through
Seems to have no concern for me now
So for now

I need this here
Old train to breakdown
Oh, please just
Let me please breakdown

Well, this engine screams out loud
Sayin' the beat gonna crawl westbound
So I don't even make a sound
'Cause it's gonna sting me when I leave this town

And all the people in the street that I'll never get to meet
These tracks don't bend somehow
And I got no time that I got to get to
Where I don't need to be, so I

I need this
Old train to breakdown
Oh, please just
Let me please breakdown

I need this
Old train to breakdown
Oh, please just
Let me please breakdown

I wanna break on down
But I can't stop now
Let me break on down

But you can't stop nothing
If you got no control
Of the thoughts in your mind
That you kept in, you know

You don't know nothing
But you don't need to know
The wisdom's in the trees
Not the glass windows

You can't stop wishing
If you don't let go
The things that you find
And you lose and you know

You keep on rolling
Put the moment on hold
The frame's too bright
So put the blinds down low and

I need this here
Old train to breakdown
Oh, please just
Let me please breakdown

I need this here
Old train to breakdown
Oh, please just
Let me please breakdown

I wanna break on down
But I can't stop now",Breakdown
Jack Johnson,"The light was leaving and the west it was blue
The children's laughter saying they're skipping just like the stones they threw
The voices echoed across the ways, it's getting late

It was just another night with the sunset and
The moon rise not so far behind
To give us just enough light
To lay down underneath the stars listening to
Papa's translations of the stories across the sky, we drew our own constellations

The west winds often last too long
But when they come down nothing ever feels the same
Sheltered under the Kamani tree waiting for the passing rain
Clouds keep moving to uncover the sea
Stars above us chasing the day away
To find the stories that we sometimes need
Listen close enough all else fades
Fades away

It was just another night with the sunset and
The moon rise not so far behind
To give us just enough light
To lay down underneath the stars listening to
All the translations of the stories across the sky to do our own constellations",Constellations
Jack Johnson,"It's such a tight game
Will it ever stop?
How will this all play out?
Both sides out of mind now

By now we should know how to communicate instead of coming to blows
We're on the road and there ain't no stopping us now
We're burning under control
Isn't it strange how we're all burning
Under the same sun
By now they say if it's a war for peace
It's the same old game
But do we really want to blame?
We could close our eyes it's still there
We could say it's us against them
We could try but nobody wins
Gravity has got a hold on us all
We could try to put it out
But it's a growing flame
Using fear as fuel
Burning down our name
And it won't take too long
Cause words are burned the same
Then who are we gonna blame
Now and all

It's such a crying, crying, crying shame
It's such a crying, crying, crying shame
It's such a crying, crying, crying shame
Shame shame shame

By now it's beginning to show
A number of people their numbers that ain't coming home
I could close my eyes it's still there
Close my mind, be alone
I could close my heart and not care
But gravity has got a hold on us all
It's a terrific price to pay
But in the true sense of the word
Are we using what we've learned
In the true sense of the word
Are we losing what we were

It's such a tight game
Will it ever stop?
It's not for me to say
And is it in our blood?
Or is it just our fate?
And how will this all play out?
Both sides out of my mind now
Who are we gonna blame all and all?

It's such a crying, crying crying shame
It's such a crying, crying crying shame
It's such a crying, crying crying shame, shame, shame",Crying Shame
Jack Johnson,"Do you remember when we first met?
I sure do, it was some time in early September
You were lazy about it, you made me wait around
I was so crazy about you I didn't mind

So I was late for class, I locked my bike to yours
It wasn't hard to find, you painted flowers on it
I guess that I was afraid that if you rolled away
You might not roll back my direction real soon

Well I was crazy about you then and now
The craziest thing of all is over ten years have gone by
And you're still mine, we're locked in time
Let's rewind

Do you remember when we first moved in together?
The piano took up the living room
You played me boogie-woogie I played you love songs
You'd say we're playing house now you still say we are

We built our getaway up in a tree we found
We felt so far away but we were still in town
Now I remember watching that old tree burn down
I took a picture that I don't like to look at

Well all these times they come and go
And alone don't seem so long
Over ten years have gone by
We can't rewind, we're locked in time
But you're still mine
Do you remember?",Do You Remember
Jack Johnson,"Well you win, it's your show now
So what's it gonna be
'Cause people will tune in
How many train wrecks do we need to see
Before we lose touch of

It's bad getting worse so

Where did all the good people go,
I've been changing channels
I don't see them
On the TV shows
Where did all the good people go,
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

They got this and that
With a rattle of tat
Testing, one two
Man what you gonna do
Bad news, misused
Got too much to lose
Gimme some truth
Now whose side are we on
Whatever you say, turn on the boob tube
I'm in the mood to obey
So lead me astray, and by the way now

Where did all the good people go,
I've been changing channels I don't see them
On the TV shows
Where did all the good people go,
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

Sitting around feeling far away
So far away but I can feel the debris
Can you feel it
You interrupt me from a friendly conversation
To tell me how great it's all gonna be
You might notice some hesitation
It's important to you it's not important to me
But way down by the edge or your reason
Well it's beginning to show
And all I really want to know is

Where did all the good people go,
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the T.V. shows
Where did all the good people go,
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

They got this and that
With a rattle of tat
Test down, one two
Man what you gonna do

You got too much to lose
Now whose side are we on

Jack Johnson,"I heard this old story before
With the people keeping calling for the metaphors
But, don't leave much up to the imagination
So I want to give this imagery back
But I know it ain't just so easy like that
So, I turn the page and read the story again and again and again
Sure seems the same with a different name
We're breaking and rebuilding, and we're growing always guessin'

Never knowing shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing and confusing
We're tryin' but where is this all leading
We'll never know

It all happens so much faster
Than you can say a disaster
Want to take a time lapse and look at it back
We found the last one but maybe that's just the answer
That we're after but after all
We're just a bubble in a boiling pot
Just one breath in a chain of thought
The moment's just combusting
Feels certain but we'll never never know
Sure seems the same give it a different name
We're begging, and we're needing and we're trying and we're breathing

Never knowing shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're clever but clueless
We're just human
Amusing and confusing
We're helping rebuilding and we're growing
Never know

Never know
Never know
Never know

Knock knock on a door to door
Tell you that the metaphors is better than yours
And you can either sink or swim
Things are looking pretty grim
If you don't believe in what feedin'
It's got no feeling so we'll read it again and again and again
Sure seems the same, so many different names
Our hearts are strong, our heads are weak, we'll always be competing

Never know we're shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're clever but clueless
We're just human
Amusing and confusing
But the truth is, all we got's question
We'll never know
We'll never know
We'll never know
We'll never know",Never Know
Jack Johnson,"When your mind is a mess so is mine I can't sleep
'Cause it hurts when I think my thoughts aren't at peace
With the plans that we make, chances we take
They're not yours they're not mine

There's waves I can't break
All the words that we say ain't the words that we mean
Words can fall short can't see the unseen
'Cause the world is awake for somebody's sake

Now please close your eyes woman please get some sleep

And know that if I knew all of the answers
I would not hold them from you
Know all of the things that I know
'Cause we've told each other
There is no other way

Too much silence can be misleading
You're drifting I can hear it in the way that you're breathing
We don't really need to find reason 'cause obviously know that it came
But it's leaving, it's leaving

Leaving like a day that's done a part of a season
Resolve is just a concept that's just dead as the leaves
But at least we could sleep it's all that we need
When we wake we would find our minds would be free to go to sleep

And know that if I knew all of the answers
I would not hold them from you
Know all of the things that I know
'Cause we've told each other
There is no other way",No Other Way
Jack Johnson,"Well I was sitting, waiting, wishing
You believed in superstitions
Then maybe you'd see the signs

Lord knows that this world is cruel
And I ain't the Lord no I'm just a fool
And a loving somebody don't make them love you

Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?

I sang your songs, I danced your dance
I gave your friends all a chance
Putting up with them wasn't worth never having you

Aw, maybe you've been through this before
But it's my first time so please ignore
The next few lines 'cause they're directed at you

I can't always be waiting, waiting on you
I can't always be playing, playing your fool

I keep playing your part
But it's not my scene
Want this plot to twist
I've had enough mystery

Keep building it up
But then you're shooting me down
But I'm already down
Just wait a minute

Just sitting, waiting
Just wait a minute
Just sitting, waiting

Well if I was in your position
I'd put down all my ammunition
I'd wonder why it had taken me so long

But Lord knows that I'm not you
And if I was I wouldn't be so cruel
'Cause waiting on love ain't so easy to do

Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?

Jack Johnson,"Situation number one, it's the one that's just begun
But evidently it's too late
Situation number two, it's the only chance for you
It's controlled by denizens of hate
Situation number three, it's the one that no one sees
Is all too often dismissed as fate
Situation number four, the one that left you wanting more
It tantalized you with its bait",Situations
Jack Johnson,"It's really too bad he became a prisoner of his own past
He stabbed the moment in the back with a brown thumbtack
Then held up the list of things he gotta to do

It's really no good he's movin' on before he understood
He shot the future in the foot with every step he took
Caught from the places that he did cause he forgot to look

Better staple it together and call a bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather

Well I guess you could say that he don't even know where to begin
'Cause he looked both ways but he was so afraid
To get deeper into the ditch every chance he missed
And the mess he made cause hate is such a strong word
And every brick he laid, the mistakes they said
And his walls are getting taller, his world is getting smaller

Better staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather

It's really too bad he became a prisoner of his own past
He stabbed the moment in the back with a brown thumbtack
Then held up the list of things he's got to do

It's really no good he's movin' on before he understood
He shot the future in the foot with every step he took
Caught from the places that he did cause he forgot to look

Better staple it together then call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather

If the weather gets better we should get together
Spend a little time or we could do whatever
And if we get together we'll be twice as clever

You're gonna have to pay her if you want to park here.

Working on the streets now, never gonna keep it.
It's quite an imposition and now she's only wishing
That she would have listened to the words they said...poor Taylor.

She just wanders around, unaffected by, 
The winter winds here, she'll pretend that
She's somewhere else, so far and clear
About two thousand miles, from here.

Well Peter Patrick pitter patters on the window,
The sunny silhouette won't let him in.
Poor old Pete's got nothing 'cause he's been falling,
And somehow sunny knows just where he's been.

Now that Saturday's gone.
And sometimes he thinks that he's on his way,

Jack Johnson,"Questions, I've got some questions
I want to know you
But what if I could ask you only one thing
Only this one time, what would you tell me?
Well maybe you could give me a suggestion
So I could know you, what would you tell me?
Maybe you could tell me what to ask you
Because then I'd know you, what would you tell me
Please tell me that there's time
To make this work for all intents and purposes
And what are your intentions, will you try?

Impressions, you've made impressions
They're going nowhere
They're just going to wait here if you let them
Please don't let them
I want to know you
And if they're going to haunt me
Please collect them
Please just collect them
And now I'm begging
I'm begging you to ask me just one question
One simple question
Because then you'd know me
I'll tell you that there's time
To make this work for all intents and purposes
At least for my own
What is a heart worth if it's just left all alone?
Leave it long enough and watch it turn into stone

You can still share, just by taking turns

If there is a new kid, invite him out to hang
If you got one sandwich
Cut that thing in half
You if you know a secret joke, tell it and share a laugh
If you got one drumstick
Give one to your friend
Make one beautiful rhythm
Share a beat that never ends
And if your feeling lonely, share time with your mom
Share some milk and cookies and sing the sharing song

Is about last night
When the sun went down
Yeah, and the trees all dance
And the warm wind blows
And the same old sound

And the water below
Gives a gift to the sky
And the clouds give back
Every time they cry
Make the grass grow green
Beneath my toes
And if the sun comes out
I'll paint a picture all about
The colors I been dreamin' of
The hours just don't seem enough
To put it all together
Maybe its as strange as it seems
Mmm, mmm

And the trouble I find
Is that the trouble finds me
Its a part of my mind
It begins with a dream
And the feelin' I get
When I look and I see
That this world is a puzzle
Find all of the pieces
And put it all together
And then I'll rearrange it
I'll follow it forever
And always be as strange as it seems
Mmm, mmm

Nobody ever told me not to try
Not to try
Always try

There's no stopping curiosity

I want to turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
I don't want this feeling to go away

I can't do everything

Things aren't always just what they seem

I blew on the sail
Watched it drift out to sea
The further it drifted the closer it came to me

A map to keep beneath your seat
You'll read to me in time I'll get you there
But fold it up so we don't find our way back soon
Nobody knows we're here

We can park the van and walk to town
Find the cheapest bottle of wine that we could find
And talk about the road behind
How getting lost is not a waste of time
The water mole will take us home
And in a moment we will sing as the forest sleeps

It's all for the sake of arriving with you
Well, it's all for the sake of arriving with you

Well, I will make the table into a bed
The candle is burning down it's time to rest
Can't take back things already gone
But I could give you promises for keeps
And I would only take them back
If they become your own and you give them to me

And it's all for the sake of arriving with you
Well, it's all for the sake of arriving with you

We could make this into anything
We could make this into more than words we speak
This could make us into anything
It could make us grow and become what we'll be, mm

Jack Johnson,"I've got an angel
She doesn't wear any wings
She wears a heart that could melt my own
She wears a smile that could make me want to sing
She gives me presents
With her presence alone
She gives me everything I could wish for
She gives me kisses on the lips just for coming home

She can make angels
I've seen it with my own eyes
You got to be careful when you you've got good love
'Cause them angels will just keep on multiplying

You're so busy changing the world
Just one smile can change all of mine

Jack Johnson,"Don't worry
Everybody in the room notices you
Sit back and relax
The night is early
We are about to overdo it
So come and tell me something that you've already told me
'Cause everybody's already heard your lovely stories
I'm hoping some of them are true

I've been losing lots of keys lately,
I don't know what that means
But maybe I've been better off with things that can't be locked at all
I've been feeling kind of sea sick lately,
See you reaching to me gonna save me
You were me, I would much rather take the fall

The world has its ways
To quite us down
The world has its ways

To quiet us down comes the rain
Down comes our spirits again
But Down comes the strength
To lift us up and then

For to long
Forget how
To let go
Seems to hard
To late now

Jack Johnson,"Tied down against the tracks
Screamin' in silent black and white
You trust us
We are such villains
We will tell ourselves anything we want to hear
If we are willin'
To listen is to learn
And too much is what we deserve
And how come when we say that we do, we don't
Can pray to anybody you want, we won't

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

But if were the ones to blame then the fruit
It shouldn't taste so good
We were used
To think we got nothing to lose
We're losin' everything but the truth
'Cause walkin' straight into a road block, bendin'
Left, it ended
Your point of view is chosen by the serpent's rules

With all its do's and don'ts
The future's an empty promise
I'm concerned and so tired of waitin'
But we could sell it wooden horses full of nightmares
And when they open
This all might be composed
There's no goin' back to the good old days
It's just a favoring and some new light
Archaism is a dusty road leadin' us back to nowhere

If we're the ones to blame then the fruit
It shouldn't taste so good
We were used
To think we got nothing to lose

I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Jack Johnson,"The light was leaving and the west it was blue
The children's laughter saying they're skipping just like the stones they threw
The voices echoed across the ways it's getting late

It was just another night with the sunset and
The moonrise not so far behind
To give us just enough light
To lay down underneath the stars listening to
Papa's translations of the stories across the sky, we drew our own constellations

The west winds often last too long
But when they come down nothing ever feels the same
Sheltered under the Kamani tree waiting for the passing rain
Clouds keep moving to uncover the sea
Stars above us chasing the day away
To find the stories that we sometimes need
Listen close enough all else fades
Fades away

It was just another night with the sunset and
The moonrise not so far behind
To give us just enough light
To lay down underneath the stars listening to
All the translations of the stories across the sky to do our own constellations","Constellations- Manchester, TN]"

Lord I pray let them be safe

Sometimes it's hard to ease my mind to realize
You're always with me waiting, willing
To hear my, thoughts my hopes,
My dreams, my every need

I pray for wisdom and overstanding

What's meant to be will always be though I control my destiny,
Free will you gave me even though you made me.
Be careful of the things you do it eventually comes back to you,

What goes around comes back around,

As I walked away

And if you could've tried to trust the hand that failed
You would've never been hungry

The more of this or less of this or is there any difference
Or are we just holding onto the things we don't have anymore

Sometimes time doesn't heal
No not at all

Lot of people spend their time just floating
We were victims together but lonely
You got hungry eyes that just can't look forward

When you're specially designed for crash testing
Or wearing wool sunglasses in the afternoon
Come on and tell us what you're trying to prove

You store it up, unleash it, then you piece it together
Whether the storm drain running rampant just stamp it
And send it to somebody who's pretending to care

Just cash in your blanks for little toy tanks
Learn how to use them, then abuse them and choose them

Who needs keys when we've got clubs?
Who needs please when we've got guns?
Who needs peace when we've gone above
But beyond where we should have gone?
We went beyond where we should have gone

Stuck between channels my thoughts all quit
I thought about them too much, allowed them to touch
The feelings that rained down on the plains all dried and cracked
Waiting for things that never came

Shock and awful thing to make somebody think
That they have to choose pushing for peace supporting the troops
And either you're weak or you'll use brut force-feed the truth
The truth is we say not as we do

We say anytime, anywhere, just show your teeth and strike the fear
Of god wears camouflage, cries at night and drives a dodge
Pick up the beat and stop hogging the feast
That's no way to treat an enemy

Well mighty mighty appetite
We just eat 'em up and keep on driving
Freedom can be freezing take a picture from the pretty side
Mind your manners wave your banners
What a wonderful world that this angle can see

Who needs please when we've got guns?
Who needs keys when we've got clubs?
Who needs peace when we've gone above

He shot the future in the foot with every step he took

And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me

And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Jack Johnson,"But there is no combination of words I could put on a post card
No song that I could sing, but I can try because this is your heart
Our dreams, and they are made out of real things
Like a, shoe box of photographs
Sepia-toned loving
Love is the answer,
At least for most of the questions in my heart
Why are we here? And where do we go?
And how come it's so hard?
It's not always easy and
Sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing, it's so much better when we're together

Mm, it's so much better when we're together
Well it's so much better when we're together
Yeah, it's so much better when we're together
Mm, so much better when we're together

And all of these moments
Just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings
Or brings new things
For tomorrow night you see
That they'll be gone too
Too many things I gotta do
But if all of these dreams might find their way
Into my day to day scene
I'd be under the impression
I was somewhere in between
With only two, just me and you
Not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be
We'll sit beneath the mango tree now

Well it's so much better when we're together
Mm, we're somewhere in between together
Mm, it's so much better when we're together
Yeah, it's so much better when we're together

I believe in memories
They look so, so pretty when I sleep
Hey now, and when I wake up,
You look so pretty sleeping next to me
But there is, there is not enough time,
And there is no, no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say

The children's laughter saying they're skipping just like the stones they threw
The voices echoed across the ways it's getting late

It was just another night with the sunset and
The moonrise not so far behind
To give us just enough light
To lay down underneath the stars listening to
Papa's translations of the stories across the sky, we drew our own constellations

The west winds often last too long
But when they come down nothing ever feels the same
Sheltered under the Kamani tree waiting for the passing rain
Clouds keep moving to uncover the sea
Stars above us chasing the day away
To find the stories that we sometimes need
Listen close enough all else fades
Fades away

The cannons don't thunder, there's nothing to plunder
I'm an under-forty victim of fate

And I've made enough money to buy Miami, but I pissed it away so fast
It's never meant to last, it's never meant to last

And I have been drunk now for over two weeks
I've passed out and I've rallied and I've sprung a few leaks

Should I be trusting them
Or only let them be?

Does it even matter at all?

From the sky to the sea
If I should fall
Would you fall down with me?
Would you fall down with me?

It was underneath me all along

So we're clapping and we're laughing like it was so absurd
In the future we'll be laughing at who we were right now
As man plays god with the land that he plunders

To the one unknown no one can know nor see
That's resistant to greed

Through the window into my life
I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind
There's this wine trying to find
It's way from the bottle into my mind
In my mind
In my mind
In my mind

And so this vine is trying to climb
Through the window into my life
To bring me symmetry
And memories of a backlit breeze
Back into a dream on the ground
Looking up at the sun coming down

Into a world of boys and girls
Are holding handheld devices
While they're eating and they're sleeping
And they're dreaming of the prices
We'll be paying down the line
When the ice melts maybe it will turn to wine

And all the greatest of the heroes started jumping from the books
They started wearing ones and zeros
Looking more and more like crooks
They stole the sunlight from the future
Took a sip, drained half the glass, and put it back

And a lot of people like to have a feast
Not so many could stomach the killing
Lot of traffic on the streets, so who's really doing all the drilling
Keep on filling what can never be full
My imagination has got a hold on me

There's this vine trying to climb
Through the window into my life
I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind
There's this wine trying to find
It's way from the bottle into my mind

Roll right in and make me their slave

Jack Jones,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Call Me Irresponsible [Performed Live on the Ed Sullivan Show 3/15/64]

I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood

I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Jack Kelly,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

Doing what he can
But what does she care
When a woman loves a man
She'll just string along
All through thick and thin
Till his ship comes in
It's always that way
When a woman love a man
She'll be the first one to praise him
When he's goin' strong
The last one to blame him
When everything's wrong
It's such a one-sided game that they play
But women are funny that way
Tell her she's a fool
She'll say yes, I know
But I love him so
And that's how it goes
When a woman loves a man

Like snowhite clouds floating through the night

Jack McDuff,"Folks here's the story 'bout Minnie the Moocher
She was a red-hot hoochie coocher
She was the roughest toughest frail
But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale

She messed around with a bloke named Smokie
She loved him though he was cokey
He took her down to Chinatown
And he showed her how to kick the gong around

She had a dream about the king of Sweden
He gave her things that she was needin'
He gave her a home built of gold and steel
A diamond car with p-platinum wheels

He gave her his townhouse and his racin' horses
Each meal she ate was a dozen courses
She had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes
She sat around and counted them all a million times

Poor Min, poor Min, poor Minnie

do you really want to to know 
Do you want to to give 
or do you just want to to take it all and go 
Coz you've gotta let it out 
if you want to let it in 
Gotta get a little bit of lovin' in 
to make it all begin 

You've gotta find time 
to pick the right time to make a change 
'cause its a fine time 
to pick the right time to make a change 

So when you gonna learn that it takes all sorts 
Don't you think life would be a little drab 
if we had the same thoughts

but you leave me with the bad 
And if you don't make a change pretty soon 
there won't be nothin' comin back

You've gotta find time

I just need to let you out to let you in with me

Do you want to give

Better let a bit of little lovin' in

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

You repeat back as if you're learning lines
It?s so easy to fall into this trap
'cause once you get there, you can't get back

As I get older I wonder what I?ll do
When I make my own choices and they say it's up to you
'cause right now I'm feeling safe, it's all the same
But in a few years if I'm nowhere, it's me to blame, ohh, ohh, ohh, ooh

People around seem to have their heads screwed on
But dreaming?s become my life, I'm finding it hard to move on
It?d be so easy if I wanted to charter survey

Deciphering is the game we're all in
If you don't see we're all made of codes

When one's within, it gets quite dim as you're just one included
Look between the glossy sheen and the shapes emerging
Heaven laughs while breaking past tiny cracks that's surging

Deciphering is the game we're all in
If you don't see we're all made of codes
Deciphering is the game we're all in, oh

The different lands are trapped in hands of rulers making us think
The worlds not ours, these ancient scars do not show anything, but
This is trite, it is our right to live that full, we possess
No one owns what nature's grown, this truth they must confess

It's a constant cycle, so hurry
Do all you can before you're buried

Ferry us through life, ferry us through life

So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

Jack Reilly,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",Ghost of a Chance
Jack Reilly,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is

So hear me if you're out there
Take these words and try to understand
That I want you and I need you

It's like you read between the minds
You know before the silence has been broken
Well, at least most of the time
But I don't know what you're going through
It must be something I didn't say to you

So hear me if your out there
Take these words and try to understand

Jack Sheldon,"In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear
And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake such a break never happens
How long can a gal go on dreaming?

If there's a chance that you care
Then, please, say you do, Baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true",I Had the Craziest Dream

Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

Jack Sheldon,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree

And I like it, how about you?",How About You?

So sweet, cool and so fair

She may search this wide world over

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Jack Teagarden,"Come to me my melancholy baby
Cuddle up and don't be blue
All your fears are foolish fancies, baby
You know dear that I'm in love with you

Every cloud must have a silver lining
Wait until the sun shines through
Smile, my honey dear while I kiss away each tear
Or else I shall be melancholy too

Every sunset too
Seems to be bringing me
Memories of you

Here and there, everywhere
Scenes that we once knew
And they all just recall
Memories of you

How I wish, I could forget those
Those happy yesteryears
That have left a rosary of tears

Your face beams in my dreams

We'll build a dream house of love dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way dear
Sharing our love in the pale moonlight

Just you and I, 
Forever and a day
Love will not die, 
We'll keep it that way

We'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune

Jack Teagarden,"No use of talkin' no use of talkin'
You'll start in dog-walkin' no matter where.
There's jazz-copation blues modulation,
Just like a Haitian you'll rip and tear.
Most everybody likes the blues

Here's why I'm ravin', here's why I'm ravin'
If it's blues you are cravin' just come on down.
You'll hear 'em playin', you'll hear 'em playin'
Soon you'll be sayin', ""Hon jazz me 'round""
Because your feet they can't refuse.

What's that familiar strain that true blue note refrain
It's drivin' me insane,
Can't keep still, tho' it's against my will;
I'm on my P's and Q's I just can't refuse.

There goes that melody, it sounds so good to me,
And I am up a tree,
It's a shame, you don't know the name;
It's a brand new blues, 
The Royal Garden Blues.

Everybody grab somebody And start jazzing 'round

Hon don't you hear that trombone moan? 
Just listen to that saxophone.
Gee, hear that clarinet and flute, 
Cornet jazzin' with a mute,
Makes me just throw myself away, 
When I hear 'em play.

That weepin' melancholy strain, 
Say, but it's soothing to the brain;
Just wanna get right up and dance, 
Don't care I'll take most any chance;
No other blues I'd care to choose, 
But Royal Garden Blues.",Royal Garden Blues

Jack Teagarden,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confessin' that I need you,
Honest I do, need you every moment.
In your eyes I read such strange things,
But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,
Saying ""can't we still be friends""
If you go, you know you'll grieve me,
All in life on you depends.

Jack Tempchin,"Well, I got lost on my way home from Tijuana
I didn't think highway five went that far
But I had to stop someplace and get directions
And I guess that's how I wound up in this bar.

Now I'm stuck in this bar 'Cause I can't find my car
I'm wishing on a star like a fool
I need a dime for the phone I wish I was home
The lonesome night can be so cruel.

Well, I lost all my paycheck playing eight ball
Foxy waitress made a rail shot one time.
I bet her that she couldn't do it again.
And that's when I lost my last dime.

And now I'm stuck in this bar 'Cause I can't find my car
I'm wishing on a star like a fool
I need a dime for the phone God, I wish I was home
The lonesome night can be so cruel.

Well, this reminds me of the time We were drinkin' Red Mountain wine
In the back of a Volkswagen bus
And I wound up in Jail with no one to go my bail
But at least, I knew where I was",Tijuana
Jack Tempchin,"It's late at night and we're all alone
With just the music of the radio
No one's coming, no one's gonna telephone
Just me and her and the lights down low

We're slow dancing, swaying to the music
Slow dancing, just me and my girl
Slow dancing, swaying to the music
No one else in the whole wide world
In the whole wide world

We just flow together when the lights are low
Shadows dancing all across the wall
Music playing so soft and slow
And the rest of the world so far away and small

We're slow dancing, swaying to the music
Slow dancing, just me and my girl
Slow dancing, swaying to the music
No one else in the whole wide world
The whole wide world

Hold me, she said, ""Hold me""
I'll never let her go

As we dance together in the dark
There's so much love in this heart of mine
She whispers to me and I hold her tight
She's the one I thought I'd never find

We're slow dancing, swaying to the music
Slow dancing, just me and my girl
Slow dancing, swaying to the music
No one else in the whole wide world
The whole wide world

In questa notte senza fine come dentro un film

Jack the Smoker,"Nella tasca io c’ho una cosa
L’appizzo giusto per scordare ogni cosa
Per affogare nel vizio
Cresciuto da solo gridavo nel vuoto “Ci sei?”
A scuola ero un demonio con la media del 666
Sogno un auto presidenziale tutta di smizzle
Io sposato alle strade buttami il riso
Sti palazzi del cazzo con la parete grigia
Esco solo da fatto: tipo valigia
Giorni uguali che senso c’è
L’odio cresceva dentro me
Sognavo una pila di cash
Alta come la torre Eiffel
Oggi precario, pendolari
Senti il piano che ho per domani
Per mia madre una casa nuova grossa duecento metri quadri

Quanto ci vuole per cambiare sta vita, sta vita, sta vita
Quanto sudore per cambiare sta vita
Chiuso in studio fino alle sei
Chiudo e fumo fino alle sei
Non scordo i guai prima delle sei
Ancora non ho benca chi cazzo sei, chi cazzo sei

Io animale nel freddo un husky
Odio il cash e temo non basti
Ma qua senza soldi è come senza caschi quando in moto caschi
Nati casti in un mondo sporco
Mascherarsi e coprirsi il volto
Sognerei un giorno un colpo al Monte dei Paschi
Questi qua hanno perso già i sogni
Chiusi al bar e senza un progetto
Ora i teknofolli son rimasti sotto e vedono i folletti quando vanno a letto
Io fumo e volo, qua è Nasa
Chi mi dice stai a casa
Dimmi su che cosa si basa
Anzi cosa si basa
Tu dov’eri qua non c’eri no
Fra i dolori della gente mia
Torni soltanto quando vedi i colori dell’argenteria
Resto con la gente mia fino alle sei
Tu alle undici vai via da dove sei

Quanto ci vuole per cambiare sta vita, sta vita, sta vita
Quanto sudore per cambiare sta vita
Chiuso in studio fino alle sei
Chiudo e fumo fino alle sei
Non scordo i guai prima delle sei
Ancora non ho benca chi cazzo sei, chi cazzo sei",666
Jack the Smoker,"Yeah
Vivi come una leggenda, muori come una leggenda

Quando muoio seppelliscimi coi testi
A fianco a Biggie, Leo da Vinci oppure Shakespeare
Seppelliscimi coi soldi come un mega re
A fianco a Gesù Cristo, a fianco a Giulio Cesare

Rime ricche Rothschild, Smeezy Boy è so fly
Volo appena soffiai, la tua tipa Yorkshire
Mi fermo quando in banca avrò one thousand
A te la porta si spalanca si però Mauthausen
Smeezy bwoah, a sti rapper brucia shoah
Riconosci quanto flow ha, più trance che a Goa
Ti soddisfa, sei un puzzle perchè il flow disfa
Ho jolle grosse tira su gridando ""oh issa""
I miei fan su, canne mica bambu
Tavola rotonda con la bomba nuovo Artù
Per alcuni genio, ma per altri un sottone
Dopo un tot ore, nella mia vita tu chiami un dottore
Tu con quella faccia sembri Yelawolf
Ieri in stanza con la tua cagnaccia che faceva ""wof""
Mattoncino da 3g dentro le Chesterfield
Poi mi faccio viaggi come il Ministro degli Esteri

Quando muoio seppelliscimi coi testi
A fianco a Biggie, Leo da Vinci oppure Shakespeare
Seppelliscimi coi soldi come un mega re
A fianco a Gesù Cristo, a fianco a Giulio Cesare

Fammi un mausoleo più grande quando muoio della piazza
Sotto casa di Bergoglio e copri d'oro l'obitorio
Dopo brucia nel petrolio tutti i miei nemici acerrimi
La tua tipa un foschi, la mia Ratajkowski Emily
Rapper Made in MI ma non mi vedi Ray-Ban
Soldi veri Cayman, tu sei Made In Taiwan
Il tuo attimo in un attimo va via
Se scrivi bene datti alla dattilografia
Lieviti leggero come Brio Blu
Ti sentivi Dio tu, dopo hai visto il mio crew
Così è la vita, entro io la chiudo tripla
Dammi una tastiera a due note perchè Smeezy si fa
Io non voglio nessuno a fianco qua frà
Sto nel deserto la classe non è acqua
Dai '90 ancora con le Converse
Ancora per mostrarti quanto la tua vita è no-sense

Quando muoio seppelliscimi coi testi
A fianco a Biggie, Leo da Vinci oppure Shakespeare
Seppelliscimi coi soldi come un mega re
A fianco a Gesù Cristo, a fianco a Giulio Cesare

Jack the Smoker,"Ogni successo è come vuoto se
Non ha uno scopo quando è senza te
Avessi più coraggio ti direi la verità
Scorderei l'orgoglio e direi vieni qua
Ma ogni vittoria è come persa se
Io ne vivo la gioia senza te
Avessi meno orgoglio ti direi la verità
Prenderei coraggio e direi vieni qua

Ora sto solo in alto, ma non sono più libero
Senza nessuno affianco, ho solo guadagnato ossigeno
Il mondo sotto non so più dov'è
Ora che sono solo in vetta affianco ho solo nuvole
Sono fatto così, tu non sai niente di me
Vedi soltanto i miei film chiusi in un mp3
Lo so che fuggo vorrei dire scusa
Ma la faccia sotto sta maschera forse ti lascerà delusa
E le certezze cadono in sequenza è un domino
Dimentica il tuo nome tutti sanno il tuo pseudonimo
Mi sento a posto solo sopra il palco, dinamite
Quando le persone sotto sono macchie indefinite

Ma ogni successo è come vuoto se
Non ha uno scopo quando è senza te
Avessi più coraggio ti direi la verità
Scorderei l'orgoglio e direi vieni qua
Ma ogni vittoria è come persa se
Io ne vivo la gioia senza te
Avessi meno orgoglio ti direi la verità
Prenderei coraggio e direi vieni qua

La mia vita altelena, da un trionfo ad un tonfo
Questa carriera è una galera e poi sei solo al mondo
Gli spettatori qua a teatro fan risate finte
Cerco soltanto il tuo sorriso ora dietro le quinte
E non ho tregua, non voglio stare con chi non mi conosceva
Ti acclamano ma è solo scena
Ricordi l'emozione? Tutta la notte a fare sogni sul balcone
Fino a quando spuntava il sole
E ora potrei avere in mano il mondo intero ma
Non c'è niente di vero qua, il mio sogno che si sgretola
Puntavo a stare come gli aeroplani
Ora ho solo molecole di cielo fra le mani

Ma ogni successo è come vuoto se
Non ha uno scopo quando è senza te
Avessi più coraggio ti direi la verità
Scorderei l'orgoglio e direi vieni qua
Ma ogni vittoria è come persa se
Io ne vivo la gioia senza te

Entro in parlamento e grido “Legalize!”
Augurando a quelli della Lega l’Aids
Ce l’ho con chi fa il mascolino
Prima fanno i grossi e dopo il nascondino
Rapper cani chiusi dentro un trasportino
Mi vedi dal vivo mi dici “cattivo fai il freddo tu sei come Helsinki”
Non sono cattivo è che canto dal vivo mica faccio foto coi selfie stick
I tuoi rapper preferiti se mi sentono poi urlano distrutti Munch
Entro e fanno tutti slurp, tu entri e fanno rutti burp!
Non c’è crew come la mia crew tutte le altre crew non vincono
La mia crew entra in radio col singolo
O Gesù entra in radio col cingolo!

Io no, io no

Da morto parlerò con le canzoni in Poltergeist
Siamo grezzi come cassonetti quindi cazzo rappi
Io riempio i locali tu i fazzoletti
Non sei degno della voce fatti il segno della croce, smetti!
I miei bro ascoltano Asap Ferg dicono yessir bevono Sizzurp
Giriamo con i rapper morti sulle t-shirt
Ed i Timberland Boots non i boots with Fur
Do not disturb è una gincana per il nirvana come Kurt
Fatti mille selfie da Trendy Girl
Così prendi più uccelli che in Angry Bird!
Investo soldi però non secondi perché ho poco tempo
Tu sei così vuoto dentro che se ti piscio in bocca dopo un po’ ti riempio
Quindi fatti meno film bevi nei locali in
Ma non reggi mezzo drink nuova scuola nuovo king
Ogni strofa è un evergreen ciò che passa tra un Lord e un Mr. Bean
Kung Fu Tai chi e tu vai giù da ring
Taglio teste col mio team new Mujahidin
Non parlarmi più di hip hop non sei tu Spike Lee
Per me rimani un chi non so io sono un tu sai chi!

Fanculo la fama, tu passi il giorno on line
Fanculo la fama, foto con i vip ai live
Io no, io no 
Io no, io no
Io no, io no

Non ci credi ma ti sta accadendo
Resto in piedi mentre stai cadendo
E ti salta il nervo con quel che ho in serbo il tuo gergo pare rap in serbo
Questo è inferno come inferno in disco
Jack uccide questi li colpisco
Non parlano di me dopo questo disco
E non parlano di me perché li zittisco (zitta troia)
Lascia fare ai più grandi bwoy risparmiati sto sforzo
Livelli infantili perciò complimenti per il disco d’orzo
Questi li vedo nei locali invece di pensare a stare sopra un mic
Invece di mostrare che sai fare con le bic
Mi vieni a molestare sulle strade per le pic

Fanculo la fama, tu passi il giorno on line
Fanculo la fama, foto con i vip ai live

And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak,
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew.
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true,
And the games you play
You would always win, always win.

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!

When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together
Nothing is better

'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew,
All the things you'd say,
They were never true, never true,
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win.

But I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time!

Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you.

Since I realized that you're the most important thing in my life
I've gotta the need to tell you I know that I was wrong
Show you how I feel and what's goin' on

I'm grown enough to say

I was too young but that's no excuse
I had too much too soon I wanted more room
To please my restless youth
Now all this peace
I can't feel your bliss
You treated me so kind, you were all mine
But I just walk away

Hangs heavy on my mind
Is there a way that you can turn back the hands

The more love that precious time I let slip by
I can't take much more of this

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,

Jack Wilkins,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

I'd surely be Spring,

Jack Wilkins,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Jack Wilkins,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now

And you'll be met there by others like you

Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer

So I walked on down the road a mile, 
Went to the house that brings a smile
Sat upon my grandpa's knee, and what do you think he said to me?

When you awake you will remember ev'rything, 
You will be hangin' on a string from your... 
When you believe, you will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know

You can take to the left or go straight to the right,
Use your days and save your nights,
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat,
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat.

Ollie warned me it's a mean old world,
The street don't greet ya, yes, it's true;
But what am I supposed to do:
Read the writing on the wall,
I heard it when I was very small.

Wash my hand in lye water, I got a date with the Captain's daughter. 
You can go and tell your brother. 
We sure gonna love one another, oh! you
May be right and ya might be wrong, 
I ain't gonna worry all day long.

Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite,

Of all my downer thoughts 
In no time there'll be 
One less sad robot 
Looking for a chance to be 
Something more than just metal 
Now I'm going part time 
With a film projectionist 
And she's the vinyl queen 
From my surfer dream 
She likes the beach boys 
More than radio metal 
And she's so good 
But, she's no good for me

What's the matter? 
You waited by the window 
(You waited by the window)

With the green grass 
But the times pass, when 
I think of you 
Whenever I'm at dinner 

Finally I've found someone 
To duel this lonely sea 
I don't spend my nights 
Searching for earthquakes 
Though it's biblical 
How fucked my sleep can be 
But she won't sleep with me

About the latest fads

Are passing fancies

And never get love
You'd better let love depart

I hope that he turns out to be

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo, yo, hey yo you brought me on Jerry just to take you back
After that bullshit you put me through a couple months back
That wasn't right, call the cops on me, and told them I had it like
""Yeah, pop the trunk, he got dope and guns""
Check for warrants, that son of a bitch on the run, I know
Three of his niggas got life, he use to roll with
And told 'em I bodied an upcoming basketball star
Once I heard that, I fell out the cop car, real hard
You bugged out, and thugged out, wanted me to take you back
That could never happen, I'm sorry
No disrespect, but you a psycho, honey
Got that S.S.I. money, and you start actin' funny
Shrimp's every night, ordering steaks
Them jumbo joints, them shits cost a buck 50 for eight
And when you told me your Merlo, need more grapes
I said ""Honey, you never had wine before!""
And if you did, that's not how you act at all
And no... that's not how we rock in Theodore

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah (Jacki-O)]
Please, babe, I love you
(Take me back, I'll never do it again)
Always want you

(Come on, home, where you belong, let's get it on)
Please, babe, I want you

Back to them days, when the yay' was bein' frontin' to you
Hundred thousand dollar shopping sprees wasn't nothin' to you
When three was a crowd, but I dealt with it
And your sex wasn't wild, but I dealt with it
I always felt shitted, you should of take me back
The girl that introduced you to boy, and helped you open your stacks
I got you in South connects, for the hard grind
That's why I took mine off the top, for the hard time
You know you need me in the streets, to help you run things
And if you catch a case, you got it wrong, I'mma pawn rings
I'm your lady boo, that's what I'm suppose to do
I know when you was coppin' my Coupe, that you was coppin' two
I know when you got me the red one, that she got the blue
But the way I chew on you, you should of got me two
Now you got me in the kitchen, with your fryin' on
Tell me that you gon' move with me, I know you lyin', dog
Who loves you baby? Nobody like Jacki-O
Cook, clean, break up your weed, and I give you nasty throat
What you actin' for? Get back in the door
Come on, home, where you belong, let's get it on

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, you know I always love you, I never meant to hurt you
Even the stress'll work you, I miss your old perfume
Promise never curse you, I want you in my circle
Honey right by my side where I keep my herbals
We both agree on no more fighting, we'll just have a verbal
The man'll treat you like a queen, I will bird you
Mother and father birthed you, if I have to hit you
Then damn, I might as well leave, 'cause I don't deserve you
Watch from you face, when you sleep, let the heat disturb you
Fiendin' from the magic wand, when she 'nique and serve you
Take me please, take me with ease
Take me back, God damn, and scrape marks on my knees
'Member the first time you made my key
You was drunk, you went behind a tree and pee'd
I miss shit like that, and all of the times
We played cops, I'll arrest you in bed
Police brutality, I'll leave the side of your ass red
God damn it, is sex for real girl? Girl, we in special ed
Fuck that, take me back, pretty please, with you on top

Jackie & Roy,"In A Sentimental Mood

Is like a flame that lights the gloom

It's all like a dream to call you mine

Jackie & the Starlites,"For all we know
We may never meet again
Before we go
Make this moment live again
We won't say goodbye
Until the last minute
I'll hold out my hand
And my heart will be in it

For all we know
This might only be a dream
We come and we go
Like the ripples, like the ripples in the stream
So baby, love me, love me tonight
Tomorrow was made for some
Oh, but tomorrow
But tomorrow may never, never come

Jackie Allen,"Your words go through and through me
And leave me totally dazed
For they do such strange things to me
They nearly make me gloomy
For you dear are so clever
So obviously the top
I wish you'd go on forever
I wish even more you'd stop

Oh it's bad for me it's bad for me
The knowledge that you're going mad for me
I feel certain my friends would be glad for me
But it's bad for me

It's so good for me so new for me
To see someone in such a stew for me
And when you say you'll do all you could for me
It's so good for me it's bad for me

I felt 'til you whispered to me
Completely left on the shelf
But since you started to woo me
I'm just crazy about myself

It's a boon for me a break for me
To hear that your heart's on the make for me
Yet no matter however appealing
I still have a feeling it's bad for me

It's so sweet for me it's swell for me
To feel that you're going through hell for me
Yet no matter however appealing
I still have a feeling it's bad for me",It's Bad for Me
Jackie Allen,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air 
For the little dark star on the wind down there 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care 
So it wouldn't get lost again

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim 
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over them
Keeping track of how it all goes on

But I've been walking all the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
And we're lost out here in the stars

Little stars, big stars, blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars
Little stars, big stars, blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars",Lost in the Stars
Jackie Allen,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves
Jackie Allen,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now
Jackie Allen,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble

Jackie Allen,"""Romance is a game for fools""
I used to say
A game I thought I'd never play
""Romance is a game for fools""
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in
Open up your heart and let this fool rush in!!",Fools Rush In
Jackie Allen,"I can hear that old clock ticking, passing time up on the wall
I can hear the faucet drippin' in the kitchen down the hall
I just sit here wishin' there was something I could say
To the one that I keep missing every night and every day

There's things you learn to live with, now that's all I ever do
But I'll never get used to living without you

Now I got used to tenderness, we'd hold each other tight
And I got used to happiness, we'd make love day and night
And I'll get used to mornings, eating breakfast all alone
Sitting in the evenings, when there's no one else at home

But there's things you learn to live with, now that's all I ever do
But I'll never get used to living without you

Without you the sun still rises, without you the rivers run
I thought by now that I'd be realizing, what's done is done

I accept the notion that there's things you can't control
The changing of the seasons or the fact we're growing old
And I know I'm the reason that you had to go away
But I will keep believing that's the price I have to pay

But there's things you learn to live with, now that's all I ever do
But I'll never get used to living without you

Oh there's things you learn to live with, now that's all I ever do
But I never get used to livin' without you, without you, without you",Living Without You
Jackie Allen,"When the night
Is wrapped around us
And the dawn might come too soon
When the only light
That's found us
Is the solitary moon

When the songbird in the willow
Sings a soft and soulful tune
Once again
You share my pillow
Making love to me
Tenderly
Here, as we share
The silent moon

As it slowly sails above us
In it's solitary flight
Seems the moon
Must surely love us
As it bathes us in it's light

Say that we can spent the day
Through a sunlit afternoon
Let your kisses say 
You'll stay here
And make love to me
Tenderly
Here, as we share

Nearer than the wind is to the willow
Dearer than the rain is to the earth below
Precious as the sun to the things that grow

You're nearer than the Ivy to the the wall is
Nearer than the winter to the fall is
Leave me but when you're away
You'll know you're nearer for I love you so

You're nearer for I love you so

Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't
