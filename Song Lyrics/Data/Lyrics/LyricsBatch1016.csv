Sweat running all over my chest (chest) I don't quit no!

The dreams that I have in store in my mind (mind) and I know
That I'm makin it I gotta get mine and nobody's takin it away
(No!) cause hammer don't play that you try to get mine
Boy you better step back freeze (freeze) cause
You don't want none I hustle for my muscle and you look

[Chorus]
Too legit... Too legit to quit (hey...hey...) Too legit...too

When I feel high post don't you play me close a dig 'em smack
A get you back and I'll hit with a dose of oaktown power
And charge you by the hour I'm shakin like a quake and funks
Get devoured I choose to abuse, misuse and confuse
Competitors who think they're makin up all the rules, fools
In the game lame and insane it's a shame I gotta do this but
I remain the same unchanged gettin better never known
As a sweater kickin it at the top cause I got myself together
So roll with a guy who's physical and fit knows the time
And too legit to quit...sang!

[Chorus] - 2X

Step to the rhythm of a sho-nuff winner (winner) I been
Here before (yo!) I ain't no beginner (word) but I been new
Tried and true survival of the fittest yo!..it brought me through
My crew (talk) we're ready to strike trained for the mission
So believe the hype and sweat it (sweat it) cause you're gonna
Regret it the day that you dissed us you'll wish you never met us
You remind me of a real short story one hit record and you
Star to bore me get ready cause this is it your crew is
Through and we too legit to quit...sang!..

[Chorus]

Too legit... Too legit to quit...Too legit... Too legit to quit
Too legit... Too legit to quit...Too legit... Too legit to quit
Get buck...get buck...get buck...get buck...get buck...(many times)

My people we don't know defeat we crush the strong and
Percolate the weak daily (everyday) we make our moves to
Improve our groove because we love to rule where we

MC Hammer,"(lyrics by M.C. Hammer; transcribed by Tone-C)
We are hittin' hard in Oakland
Word!
We are hittin' hard in L.A.
Word!
Cleveland, Chicago & Yo-town is on fire
Word, word, word!
Atlanta's proper
Word!
And in Miami, we are mooovin' somethin'
Hmmmmm.

Turn this mutha out
Oaktown posse they will
Turn this mutha out
Yeah boy, they will
Turn this mutha out
M.C. Hammer he will
(chorus ends early)

Hammer, you ain't hittin' in New York
What?
So what you gon' do about that, Hammer?
I'm gon' turn this mutha out.

Hammer, he is...

Strong like a lion, no denyin'
I'm in effect and you suckas are tryin'
To get with me, you can't hang
Doin' it like this, I'm in with a bang
Goin' boom like thunda, and you wonder,
How in the world can the Hammer be underneath me?
He's gonna beat me, say yes to the master and I will teach thee

(chorus)
Turn this mutha out
Turn this mutha out
Turn this mutha out
Turn this mutha out

Hammer, tell 'em how you came up babeeee!

I was a student, now I'm the teacher,
I was a member, now I'm the preacher,
I was a worker, and you were the boss,
Now I'm gettin' paid and you're takin' the loss
Once says stop, the other says flee
No, don't perpetrate M.C. Hammer is the feature
Step off, you punk, no fear, I'm M.C. Hammer and I came here to...

(chorus)

I'm improvin', better start schoolin
Headed to the top where I'll be rulin'
On top, of hip-hop, I'm in effect and you're not
Your records aren't cool, your shows are weak
Duel with the Hammer and meet defeat
Every night, every week,
I'm comin' correct, you don't want none of me.

(chorus)
X2
I keep hearin' what you sayin'
""Yo Hammer, we knowin' New York's on the wayin'""
I don't care where you from,
I make most look silly, and others look dumb
Yeah suckas, you should, run,
I am, def on the stage, pumpin' at the club
Hammer is an eagle, and you a dove

(chorus)

(funky beats & breaks)


(chorus)
I'm from Oaktown, be-boy straight down
Takin all comers, whoever want to get some
I'm original, you're digital
You want somethin' to say, you're show is pitiful
Don't worry, I'm in tact
Whatever I say, the Hammer will back
Twice as strong, It's goin' on
And I willll...

And this is a beat uh u can't touch

Yo I told you u can't touch this
Why you standing there man u can't touch this
Yo sound the bells school is in sucker u can't touch this

Give me a song or rhythm
Making 'em sweat that's what I'm giving 'em
Now they know when you talk about the Hammer
You talk about a show that's hyped and tight
Singers are sweatin' so pass them a mic
Or a tape to learn what it's gonna take

MC Hammer,"Ah yeah, I'm glad I put this tape in
I'm just gon' cruise down the road
Look at the stars in the sky
And drift off into the sweet memories that I have
Of a love that my heart has been searching for
For so long, and I know somewhere
If I keep searching, that love I'll find
The picture grows clearer and clearer
From the back to the front of my mind
And like love, a love I know I'll have
The girl that I want, she'll be mine, she'll be fly, and it'll last

I see her face and I can't let go
She's in my dreams and my heart, so let me know
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I'm looking for that love
She's a thought and a vision in my memory
I haven't met her, but tell me where could she be
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I'm looking for that special love
(Love, oh love, love is a feeling that I need)
Love is a feeling that the Hammer definetly needs
(Please be mine)
Baby be mine
(I need your love to make it)
I need your love to make it
So why don't you be mine
The search is going on
From coast to coast
A women for the man, who's propping the most
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
My heart is beating strong
This love cannot be wrong
I need her and I want her, so come on to my home

At the movies, in my car, on my stereo
At a game of Different World or the Cosby Show
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
Yo veo, tell me what's up
At the track, at the club, or out buying dub
If you've seen her, then I'll have her, cause I'm in love
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
My heart is hurting so bad

Be mine baby
(I need your love to make it)
I need your love to make it
Why don't you be mine
(Baby, be mine)
Where could she be?
At the store around the corner
Or wondering at night
Or chilling with another brother holding the mic
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
Hammer, you know I'm looking
Calling all my friends all around the place
Guy, Lavertte, or my homey Rob Base

Have you seen her?

(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)

The thought is so clear of the love I need here
Like D-B magic, and why don't you appear
(Have you seen her?)
Oh baby, why don't you appear
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I can see yo' face
I'm seeing her face, again and again
Come knocking at my door, and you know I'll let you in
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)

Tu peux miaulé ou te trancher les artères fais un choix, ok je les mérite ;mais y pourrait bien
que ça se frite car les lardus me chauffent, envie de coller des gaufres je pourrai m'estimer heureux
car d'autre ont été fumée à Auschwitz, j'ai la scoumoune au pays de la choucroute
mon espace vital que dalle à part un chiotte et une crotte laissée par une ex,
je suis furax ma gueule ! y a de quoi devenir la masse bref, chaise,

MC Lars,"My girlfriend hates you but I love your stuff. 
I listen to it all the time, I can't get enough. 
I dig your first CD (your debut), 
And â??Society of People Named Elihu.â?? 
And â??Making Loveâ?? is fresh, this much is true, 
But â??Redefining Musicâ?? is funky and new. 
And so I crank it up, turn it up, 
And pump up the bass. 
The package's synth lines are up in my face. 
I listen to it when I drive any place. 
Up yours to anyone who says I've got bad taste! 
Atom's music rocks, with nerdy soul. 
His new-wave-synth-punk is never dull. 

CHORUS
Atom, you're awesome. 

I had a dream 
When I was in grade school 
That Rob Halford, he kissed me, see fool. 
And I was welcomed to the family with Connor, 
It was undercover funny just like a longer 
Keyboard that Enya played. 
So I pumped iron and I got paid 
When I owned the Redskins 
With the Ghetto Boys, 
Breaking down the walls with kilogram toys. 
And we sang to Madonna, all night long, 
I opened up my heart, I opened it strong 
To Tim Allen, who's not that funny, 
In Philadelphia where I made lots of money 
As a goalie, sixteen-hundred pounds. 
Chillling on the ice rink so profound, 
Upside down from here on the map, 
Sick of people who give me crap. 
So I put them on an island in the middle of the sea, 
And it was just Atom, Atom and me. 

REPEAT CHORUS",Atom You're Awesome
MC Lars,"[Chorus]
Roses are red, violets are blue. 
My rhymes rhyme, but yours don't. 

Hey! I'm all up in your face like a rabid chimp, 
I'll eat shrimp on a blimp but I ain't no wimp. 
I send American flags to Ho Chi Minh, 
And Bart Simpson toys to Sam Kinison. 
If you're akin to sin, you may just win, 
Unless you buy a condom that's made of lamb skin. 
I'm down with you of course and your friend Ian, 
Although half of this rap is Indo European. 
I translated it so it would make sense 
To all you ladies and gents but there's no evidence 
If I'm going too fast or if I'm going too slow. 
You can always press""repeatâ?? on this funky fresh flow. 
Though you may not even know if I mean what I say, 
It's legit when I tell you this homey don't play. 
So sit back and relax and pop open a Coke, 
Compared to me, 50 Cent, your rhymes are a joke. 

[Chorus] 

Word, word, word to your mother and your father too, 
And props to anyone who keeps staying true. 
And shout outs to my homeys across the globe, accept diversity but diss a homophobe. 
The only way to understanding is to embrace the truth, 
We're all creatures of God, Buddha, Allah, and Zeus. 
We're only here for a bit, so make the best of it. 
Don't look back in sixty years 
To see your life wasâ?¦ garbage! 
But the point I'm trying to make is that 
My flows are so def like a big milkshake. 
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast, 
But the Sugarhill Gang is misquoted the most. 

[Chorus] 

So get this point right here, it's perfect clear, 
Props to anyone who bought""Nothing to Fear.â?? 
Shout outs to Wesley Willis, Atom G., and John Hall. 
Word to MC Paul Barman, hey return my call! 
What's up to Jerry Garcia, Hendrix, Morrison and Zappa, 
Word to Devo,""Weird Al,â?? and those girls from Abba. 
I hope you have a good day and that you're feeling swell, 
Even though the music industry can be hell.

Post-rap, post-punk, post-Kurt Cobain, post cool Moe Dee post-House of Pain.
Chuck D told me I had to be me so I bought the Public Enemy CD.
I ripped one track in .mp3, ""ill Lars Ulrich came after me.
I said, ""It's me your lost nephew"", he said, ""No way, that can't be true.""
I kicked him with my Converse shoe all the way to Timbuktu.
Of Wolf and Ulrich, Sad But True, he lived there for a year or two.
He mastered Puppetry alone, justice for Sean Fanning clones.

I got mad props from the BBC, but hip-hop heads still don't get me.
So I take a chance, I rhyme white but so what? I like James Brown and Beyonce's butt.
Whatever your race I'll Friendster you and rent two Spike Lee NetFlix too.
And I still rock shows and try to dance, still rock Simpsons underpants.
And I still like Rush and Dr. Dre. I still keep bumping N.W.A.
I get fresh on the mike like a milkman on duty,
So burn this disco to the ground and baby shake that booty.
I attack the track like a Steve Segal movie. 3D fresh, not 2D fruity.

Now that's fresh, that's fresh (get fresh). Now that's fresh,

05 so live, I've been doing this for years,
making money 'cause I'm funny with this music of the spheres.
And I dance! Hey, watch me dance.
Goofy MC's can't be me even if they had the chance.
Pondora have you seen Persephone?
Hades rabies got me going like KRS-One.
Why is that? (I don't know) MC's act like they don't know.
I poison this track with a Scorpion flow.

Because I rock the mike like a hurricane.

MC Lars,"Nd people tried to put us down, when iTunes bumped a post-Cold War sound.
My generation sat the mecca of malls, Times Square, I'm there, Viacom installs.
So we hit the net while the Trade Center fell, New York met Hollywood, we ran like hell.
No Vietnam for us, yo, Iraq it's on. So who agree upon this cowboy Genghis Khan?
The choice made, baby. Hey we'd take it back, logged in dropped out, MTV took track.
They sold it back to us and claimed no correlation. The iMac, iPod, iGeneration.
And I'm waiting for the day we can get out. The world is ours, that's the story no doubt.
Want to be more info super highway traffic, want to be more than a walking demographic!

CHORUS
""Hey! You're part of it."" Talking about the iGeneration.
""Yeah! You're part of it."" Talking about my iGeneration.

See the iGeneration knew organization meant optimization and unification,
When imagination gave participation in creation of culture a manifestation.
The Berlin Wall fell and out we came, the post-Cold War kids laid claim to AIM.
LOL, OMG, yo, BRB. Space, colon, dash, closed parenthesis.
We sat at our laptops and typed away, and found that we each had something to say.
Web-logged our fears, our hopes and dreams. Individuated by digital means.
Fiber optic lenses, DVD, Coca Cola, Disney and Mickey D's.
Flat mass culture, the norm that took holdÉ I hope I die before I get sold.

Who's that (who's that) rapping?
Who's that rapping at my chamber door?
Mr. (mister) Raven!
All up in my grill like, ""Nevermore.""

Kick it! Once upon a midnight dreary, while I kicked it weak and weary,
Dark and cold just like Lake Eerie, Brand New sample, someone clear me.
While I nodded nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping.
Up like, ""What?"", this thunder clapping in my brain like graphic Halflings.
Staffing me, I put down Milton. Cell phone mute like Paris Hilton.
Open window, halfway built-in. Times a changing like Bob Dylan.
Twenty-pound bird black as could be, cold feet cold eyes aimed straight at me.
Grim face, grim stare, death carnivore, quote that raven ""Nevermore.""

[Chorus]

I miss Lenore, my Annabel Lee, taken by angels from me.
Alone with books (hey that's me!), harbinger of death visiting me.
I said, ""Can I help you, evil prophet? If you got a problem, look, I'll solve it.""
He checked my hook, DJ revolved it, perched on Pallas, chalice dropped it.
""Tell me sir, please, if you can. Am I good or evil man?
What can I say, what can I do, when will I be rid of you?""
""Nevermore,"" quote he at me, hating on this fresh MC,
Satanic raven, Niche glee, killing me softly like the Fugees.
Now I feel worse, my verse is terse, joy inverse just like Fred Durst.
Call a nurse, disperse my thirst put this process in reverse.
Wish I'd had some warning first, MC Lars, '88 hearse.
Now I'll never be Slug or Murs, under that black raven's curse.
The ravens eyes still have the seeming of a demon that is dreaming,
Lamplight over him still streaming, hear my screaming, hear me screaming!
My soul still floats there on that floor and shall be lifted nevermore.
Afflicted calm, like Michael Moore, canonized piece, US folklore.

[Chorus]

Who's house? Raven's house!",Mr. Raven
MC Lars,"Once upon a time, in the city of Los Angeles...
""Marty, Marty listen to me. Bring me something the kids will cry for.
Get out there, and get us stoked!""

Meet Marty, major label A&R scout, forty years old, gut hanginh out.
Red Ferrari, Marty livinh in L.A. bumps another line to get through the day.
Dumped by his girl, he paid for her liposuction,
His friends call him ""Money"", in his introduction.
And Marty knows nothing but claims to know it all,
Lose the flat screen TV if he drops the ball.
You're as good as your last hit, find the next big thing.
If he doesn't bring the bling, his cell phone won't ring.
What's the trend, what's new? What's a label scout to do? Office life, Marty 11:32.
The label pres. calls and yells, ""Sign more emo!""
How about screamo? ""If it sells, sign Nemo,""
""We're down 2%, and BMG knows,
My Daughter likes Dashboard, so get me one of those!""
He checks AP.net, the Scout and more,
yelling band names to his assistant through the door.
The kids like this, who cares if it's great?
So he signs a band called Hearts that Hate.

""Marty... we've got a hit.""

CHORUS
Cry tonight. My hands around your hands.
I won't let you die tonight.
Cry tonight. My heart's in your hands.
I won't let you...

Hearts that Hate, Marty goes to their show, up in the club and here we go.
Marty sees a girl in a Simple Plan shirt with a Senses Fail boy, that'll never work.
He finds his label friends in the corner they huddle,
An emo cattle auction, they penetrate the bubble.
They talk about Victory and signing TBS,
Dissing the same bands they just tried to impress.
So the lights go down, the crowd starts to scream,
Hearts that Hate have hit the scene.
Blake on vocals, and lead guitar,
He does a backflip, ""Look how different we are!""
They show up at the studio to record it,
A TRL, Billboard Modern Rock hit.
They auto-tune Blake, but he can't tell.
He says, ""I've got perfect pitch, damn I sing well.""
ProTools, Logic, cut, copy, paste, quantized solos and quantized bass.
Signed, sealed, deliver and sent, across the U.S. and the single went...

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Momentum builds, but it all caves in.
Industrial comes back, the pres. needs a NIN.
Marty finds a new band called ""Fetal Coil""
And Hearts that Hate try to keep their fans loyal.
They re-work their sound for album number two,
As ""Machines of Hate,"" but their career is through.
They break up and work pushing mops and brooms,
Blake gives guitar lessons in his living room.
Blake gives guitar lessons in his living room,
Blake gives guitar lessons in his living room.

""Can you teach me track five Mr. Blake?""
""Hey, I wrote that song and it goes like this!""

MC Lars,"9 o'clock class feels like five, asleep at three, so sleep deprived.
STAT-60 satisfies 2C, the math GER, not the one for me.
The Central Limit Theorem? Speak English.
The Sum of Squares? I don't need this.
But I'm positive, studying hard, gotta pass this, no holds barred.
But essay due last Thursday man, Moby Dick I understand.
Up 'till five in the library, Meyer Lair, kind of scary.
Asleep at eight then up at ten, missed the lecture can't pretend,
I get the null hypothesis... on Tuesday's test, I was dissed.

Got STAT-60 on my mind,
In my notes and in my rhymes.
Chi-squared values all the time,
Easy quarter? Not this time.

Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated, Professor Thomas?
Never are the quiz score grades ever inflated, but you taught this:
You get involved in radio, work really hard, get your own show.
But whoops, you slip, and play a track, uncensored as matter of fact.
The FCC gets on your back, the station manager says it's whack.
The probability that you'll loose your show on 90.1? 1.0.
Let's say that you're late for class, racing down peddling fast.
You live in A, class is at be	, integrate time and velocity.
The probability that you'll crash your bike,
In White Plaza on the way to Psych, .34 on your cell phone, .85 if you hit a cone.

Got STAT-60 on my mind,
In my notes and in my rhymes.
Chi-squared values all the time,
Easy quarter? Not this time.

Let's say you meet this hot sophomore, she likes you, you can't ignore
X the months that you date, P the probability that it's great.
You break up but you still kiss, you're not discrete it's continuous.
Late night hook ups nebulous, thin line friendship no big fuss.
Weekly sessions on the phone, made the right choice, you're on your own.
Good to be single all alone, degrees of freedom you can't clone.
But calculate E of X, you're at a party you see your ex,
The probability that your heart breaks in 2
She's with someone new and it's not you.

Got STAT-60 on my mind,
In my notes and in my rhymes.
Chi-squared values all the time,
Easy quarter? Not this time.

S-T-A-T sixty, baby.
S-T-A-T sixty, baby.
S-T-A-T sixty, baby.

MC Lars,"Check this see major!

Comin' straight outta Stockholm, a fun boy named Lars,
Survived Loma Prieta, Mad Cow, and SARS.
I hit you with these flows like your name was Nancy Kerrigan
Here and back and there again, atypical American.
Third generation Swedish, second gen. Aussie,
Am I street enough for this? Sometimes I'm ""Paranoid"" like Ozzy.
See it used to be punk rock for about four years,
I played lead guitar, we dissed Britney Spears,
Amphoteric the name, Central Cali band,
Local shows, t-shirts, EP's, no plan,
Just chilling with the crew slamming power chords,
They wanted more guitars but I got bored.
I was born to rock heads and fill them too,
But did the world really need another Blink 182?
Stuck on this Earth like glue since 1982,
Cooked up my own post-modern salmagundi stew.

[CHORUS]
Straight outta Stockholm, lap-top rap,
American iconoclast, alien boom-bap,
Cali's my home, baby, West Coast boy,
I get more love than Helen of Troy.

Straight outta Stockholm, lap-top rap
American iconoclast, alien boom-bap,
I make rap fun, friendly, fresh and new
MC Lars in the place, yeah boy, I thought you knew!

""But... were you actually born in Stockholm, Lars?""
No, but my family on my Mom's side is Swedish-American.
""Uh... okay.""

Comin' straight outta prep school, on the mike at assembly,
Class clown, straight A's, running KSPB.
Pebble Beach, sheltered high school, like a nun on Mars
The Horris was Dr. Quin, Heavyweights gave me Lars.
""So how do you spell it? Yo, what's the website?""
Is it really that hard? ""Morris"" with an H - alright!
And okay yo today see I'm still experimenting,
Venting & presenting never misrepresenting.
And it's not quite rap, not quite pop,
Alien hip-hop Lars punk rock,
If I make the big time I'll still sit up in my room,
My brain on the keyboard and I'll try to resume,
Such a great story that I'll always behold,
I'll look back on this when I'm 80 years old.
London, New York, UK tour, NY demo,
Tickled as can be, when I tickle you like Elmo.
So much to say, new sounds to try,
Laptop, costumes, local buzz, and why?
Don't ask me, buddy, but you're bumpin' me now!
Amalgam for the future revolution like Mao.
You're right when I grab the mike, I do what I like,
I sit with a pen by the full moon light.
Euphonic epiphany like Keat's lyre trope,
I am it, iambic's rap's last hope.
My Grandma says I have rhyme talent, and I love her.
I flow lethal, Weapon? Lyrical like Danny Glover.
I flip your paradigm manhole cover,
Mutant reptiles, surprised what you discover.
But I still like Bob Dylan more than any MC.
Most depress me, like Hepatitis B.
Reverse them like Pi when they step to me
Nine five one four one point three.

MC Lars,"21 Concepts

I wrote a song about a fetus named Cletus who tried
To run for governor before he died
He lived in California but traveled worldwide
It was a big huge hit! Just kidding I lied
There's the song about the 90's, I sampled Ace of Base
But kept it off the album in the interest of taste
“Cheyenne Rock City,” a song about touring
But rhymes about Wyoming are really very boring
As for the Churchill song, give me a break!
How many songs about England could my listeners take?
There was a track about women and the drama they bring
“Hot Girls Make Guys Do Really Stupid Things”
Remember “Geeked Out”? You don't but I do,
“The geek shall inherit the Earth,” it's true!
I rapped about nerds being cooler than jocks
But if I wanted biased news,
I would have just watched Fox

CHORUS
I've got 21 concepts but a hit ain't one
If you're having lyric problems I feel bad for you son
I've got a list of songs here I once thought were the bomb
But when I laid them down in ProTools
They all came out wrong!

“Las Vegas Invasion” was a sci-fi track
About aliens addicted to playing blackjack
I wrote a song about a kid who made his own flick
But got a bad review in Ranger Rick
I didn't want to get lynched or punched in mouth
So I didn't do that song making fun of the South
I did a song about how girls at Stanford are whack
Called “College Is Where Girls Go to Get Fat”
There was the KRS slash Nirvana debut
But the mash-up thing was so 2002
I did an anti-Bush track, and then I did five more
But “Rock Against Bush” was so 2004
I wrote a song about China, how could I go wrong?
I rapped in Cantonese about Mao Zedong
It went um goy, neh ho ma?
Nehih sik ying mun ma?

CHORUS
I've got 21 concepts but a hit ain't one
If you're having lyric problems I feel bad for you son
I've got CD-R of tracks I once thought would be tight
But when I played it for my girl I slept alone that night!

Write a song about a can that gets crushed a lot
Write a dental hygiene jam that says, “brush a lot”
Write a Bill O'Reilly track that says “hush” a lot
No I'm not a player I like Rush a lot!

CHORUS
I've got 21 concepts but a single ain't one
“If you're still referencing Jay Z I feel bad for you son”
So what's the secret to hip-hop, jazz, blues and rock?
Step one get out a pad and kill your writer's block… start!
I've got 21 concepts but a hit ain't one
If you're having lyric problems I feel bad for you son
I've got a list of songs here I once thought were the bomb
But when I laid them down in ProTools
They all came out wrong!",21 Concepts
MC Lars,"Call me Ahab, what, monomaniac
Obsessed with success unlike Steve Wozniak
On the hunt for this mammal that once took my leg
With my warn down crew and my man Queequeg
“You're never going to find him!” He's a big sperm whale
“The ocean is enormous!” Shut up, we're setting sail
This scar that you see that runs down my face
Has scarred my soul and inspired this chase
Mental sickness has got me on the run
Full speed ahead! This is American fun
There is wisdom that is woe, so welcome to my life
It was fine until Moby scarred me like a knife
Towards thee I sail, thou unconquering whale
To stab my spear into your white tail
The first one to stop him gets this gold doubloon
Now excuse me while I go be melancholy in my room!

CHORUS
(Got a low low feeling around me)
Bad trip thanks to Moby Dick!
(And a stone cold feeling inside)
Peg leg, sperm whale, jaw bone, what!
(And I just can't stop messing my mind up)
Whale crash so fast
(Or wasting my time)
Oh no, oh no!
The ship's got a hole, plug it up, plug it up!

“We're never going to find this white whale,
Are we captain?”

Hey Ishmael… can I call you annoying?
Grown up Beluga in the deep blue sea
Swims so fast and swims so free
With the heaven above, Moby Dick stressing me
And this crazy drenched crew below
Call it idiot pride, or call me Oedipus
My main tragic flaw… “But what about us?”
It's your battle too, crew, man vs. beast
At least have respect as we sail south and east
And north and west, look I'm doing my best
While the rain keeps pouring
we're exhausted and stressed
Pip went insane when he almost drowned,
So profound when he shrieks like a little sailor clown
Random ships we met warned us of our doom
They said our boat would be our tomb
Near the Mariana Trench, deep and oceanic
We spotted Moby Dick so white and titanic

REPEAT CHORUS
I said, “You took my leg, and for that you must die!”
I threw my spear and hit Moby in the eye
He charged the boat, it began to sink
I said, “How about that? Hubris really stinks!”
I didn't think that it would end like this
Pride met fate, this captain got dissed
Let it be a lesson, revenge is never sweet
So I stomp my peg to this Supergrass beat!

REPEAT CHORUS

(Got a low low feeling around me)
That's it, thanks to Moby Dick!
(And a stone cold feeling inside)
Peg leg, sperm whale, jaw bone, what!
(And I just can't stop messing my mind up)
Whale crash so fast
(Or wasting my time)
Oh no, oh no!

Lars: Hey yo Ill Bill – will you sign this for me?
I found it at Amoeba it's the Green CD
Bill: No doubt kid, what's your name?
Lars: It's MC Lars
Bill: Word, Howie Abrams is a mutual friend of ours
He played me your joint Lars: What'd you think of it?
Bill: I think it's bugged out, it's hot
Lars: Thanks, I like your last record a lot. Your lyrics are
Graphic, much like your brother Necro, is he psycho?
Bill: I don't know, it really depends though
He's Psychological, half psycho, half logical,
Half businessman, half put-them-in-the-hospital
Lars: Business and art, there's a very fine line
There's the person that you are
And the person when you rhyme
But the best MC's bring both intertwined
Bill: I agree, that's when the best of both worlds collide
When the realness pops off one time for your mind,
And your words cause the people in the crowd to riot

CHORUS
As many places I've been. As many people I've met
As many haters I've dissed. There's people that I respect
As many times as I've failed. As many times as I've won
As many lives as I touch. The dialogue has begun

Bill: I grew up on heavy metal and hip-hop
The energy was the same to me, it was insane to me
It made me want to rage against the machine
Pick up a guitar and scream into the mic like Run-DMC
Lars: Nine Inch Nails, Primus, “Weird Al,” and King Missile
Influenced me like a postmodern epistle
Geeked out on my Performa looping digital drums
Playing rock guitar in punk bands just for fun
Who's your favorite rapper? Bill: Rakim, G Rap and Kane
KRS, EPMD, NWA, Public Enemy, Shante and LL Cool J
I could keep naming MC's all day,
What type of metal stuff you listen to?
Lars: Old school Slayer CD's, Biohazard and
Bile were the bands for me
The first time that I ever heard Chuck D
Was the Anthrax CD, “Attack of the Killer B's”… chorus!

REPEAT CHORUS
Lars: So Bill, what's your take on censorship?
Politicians on a church/state fusion tip?
Bill: I speaks my mind while kids I went to high school with
Bleed on the sands of Kabul hit, it's bullshit,
Lars what you think of it?
Lars: Out in Iraq, a lack of dialogue
Between the people is whack!
Bill: In fact I speak militant like Black Panthers
These gas prices got my people
With seeds having to gank pampers
Lars: The answer is not plutocracy.
The answers is not hypocrisy,
The answers is true democracy
Bill: The answer is the dialogue constantly

Maybe I can come and visit? Maybe you should wait
See, I'm really forty-seven, I have kids and a wife
I weigh three hundred pounds and I hate my life

Are you serious? Yes, well, I've got a secret too
I'm not twenty, I'm really thirty-two
I only have one leg and I like to sniff glue
You lied to me, Carol
Well, you lied to me too

Online relationships are just pretend
Unplug your heart, upgrade your system
Get, get off the Internet

But people can surprise you from behind a screen
Listen to this verse and you'll see what I mean

Hi, I'm Susie, I like your profile
I checked out your pics and I like your style
Sounds good, Susie, I?ll be your friend
We can write each other again and again

Comment on my pics and post on my page
Join my groups and guess my age
You must be eighteen, how could you not?
You can't be in high school, you're just too hot

Let me send you pics for your personal collection
I hope they inspire you and give you a smile
Susie sent Bob pics that were borderline obscene
Cops showed up at his door, she was only sixteen

It?s not normal to have an Internet girlfriend
Online relationships are just pretend
Unplug your heart, upgrade your system
Get, get off the Internet

If you don't believe, us here's a final story
About a boy named Marcus and his online girlfriend Lorie
Behind the monitor truth is hidden from your eyes
Marcus didn't know but he was in for a surprise

we've been dating for a while but let's cut to the chase
I don't know what you look like and I wanna see your face
But what does it matter? You know who I am inside
What if you're not a woman and this whole time you lied?

You got me there, I'm not really a female
I'm a guy who pretends to be a girl through email
So this is why it?s bad to meet women online
Living life behind the screen is a total waste of time

The following is an entirely fictional account.
Any similarities between people living or dead is entirely
Coincidental… just kidding.

She fell from the sky on a black October night
She wrote these funny songs and every one was tight
She asked me for advice on jump-starting her career
But I'm staring in her eyes as she's talking in my ear
Suburban rap queen, I wrote this song for you
Suburban rap queen, what's an MC to do?
Suburban rap queen, every Biggie needs a Kim
Suburban rap queen, sometimes you lose, sometimes you win

CHORUS
Rapgirl, Rapgirl, I like you a lot
You've got what it takes to rock that Lars emo spot
Rapgirl, Rapgirl, now tell me what to do
When the playback is too quiet and the
Song's already through

This is called a breakbeat!
It's the musical element hip-hop
Was founded on back in 1969.
That's educational.

She fell from the sky with a superhero icon
We battled in the studio like, “Hey, yo, is this mic on?”
I went down for the count, she went up on the beat
I told her she was hot because stuff like that is sweet
She attacked me with her similes like killer bees at a park
I came back with a metaphor, an angry great white shark
The bass line that she struck threw me flat on my back
So I came back with a track in a lyrical attack

REPEAT CHORUS

Because girls are so confusing, and I guess they'll always be
I should just become a monk, resign to celibacy
Then I'd never have to worry about what a hug might mean
See these girls who want to be your friend
May be just what they seem
We had burritos in your dorm and talked about Dizzee Rascal
We wrote a song together, recorded it, and that's all
Romantic love is fear of waking up alone
In Redwood City with platonic voice mail on your phone

REPEAT CHORUS

[Intro, MC Nate]
hey, welcome to the orientation
my name's Nate and I'll be your homie for this year
today we'll be moving into our dorms and building community
so go get your keys from the main office
come back,and get ready to meet your roommates
alright?
(alright alright alright)

He was the roommate from hell
He was the roommate from hell

[verse 1, MC Lars]
Satan was my roommate, so junior year was hell
he lacked social skills and had a pudgent smell
when your roommate is the devil it can be extremely wack
putting posters on the wall of Trapt and Nickelback
until the break of dawn he'd be mutilating sheep
it's 4 A.M. Satan, can you please go to sleep?
I can't have girls over when the dorm smells like Sterno
when did room 56 become Dante's Inferno?
he likes death and destruction, I like radio and art
he likes holding down Christians and reading (?)
while I'm going class studying my notes
he's eating baby fetuses and sacrificing goats
he tricks the freshmen girls into eating apples
holding black masses down at the campus chapel
should of never moved in (but no) wished I were dead
should of found a place off campus on Craig's List instead

[chorus]
he was the roommate from hell
his name was Lucifier
someone call a priest
and bring the crucifer
he was the roommate from hell
leaves his pitchfork in my bed
I'm in a satanic panic
cuz he is messing with my head

[repeat chorus]

(yo)
(wut)
(pass the dope helium over here yo)
(okay, but wait... Satan, that's too much!)

[verse 2, mcchris]
boy you need a bitch slap, not my fault we're mismatched
you geek out over Beakman's World, I dig out World of Witchcraft
you thinkin' that I'm riff-raff, huffin' on a dishrag
I am just a player, play Slayer then I kick back
I know I reek of sulfer, leave the shower curtain open
I come home drunk, make crank calls to (?)
but college is like Salem, all these bitches be so smokin'
if you're thinkin' that I'm leavin' then I'm thinkin' that you're jokin'
I gotta share my bong with this post-punk chump
(?) says you've been through all my stuff
""I wish you'd go to hell"", I say ""hey that's where I'm from""
blast Death Cab and Devo, he's too emo to get crunk
I was a very nice boss down in Paradise Lost
I have very nice bling cuz my minions (?)
colleges is knowledge at a very high cost
gotta go do some blow with that ho Kate Moss

how many dope albums are there named after you?

MC Lars,"Move over Kevin Bacon, ‘cause I've got a new game
It's called “Six Degrees of Kurt Cobain”
The man was an icon of Generation X
A sound between Joy Division and NOFX (what?)
Let's dissect this album called “Nevermind”
Produced by Butch Vig of Garbage not Sublime
Butch toured with U2, who wrote a song called “Bad,”
Just like Michael Jackson, this next part is rad
“Weird Al” made fun of “Bad,” and Nirvana too
It brings us back to Kurt (here we go) (round two)
Kurt was in a band with Mr. Dave Grohl
Dave was in Scream, that's the band not the movie
Courtney loved to scream for a band called Hole
She married Kurt Cobain and had a troubled soul
Some people said she killed him, but that could be a lie
Kurt wrote a song called “I Hate Myself and Want to Die”
Courtney Love landed “Man on the Moon”
Where Jim Carrey sang a song
From the Mighty Mouse cartoon
Danger Mouse not Mighty Mouse worked with the Beatles
He mixed them with Jay Z the whole thing was illegal
Speaking of illegal Jack White did some time
He hit another guy and assault is a crime
So “Get Behind Me Satan” was loved by Rolling Stone
Which leaves us with a cover: Kurt Cobain all alone.

You can take away my space ship
You can take away my space suit
You can even take away my space lasers
But you can never, ever take away my space game
I broke through the carbonite that's how I got free
Jabba, back up, because there's no stopping me
Post-modern player, sample-tastic.
Flow's ekphrastic, I get drastic
Hey, watch the plastic, yo, I name check
And leave you drowned in space oobleck
Player of the future, watch me go!
Sith girls scream when they hear my flow
These alien chicks reproduce with spores
So I go where no MC has gone before
Hey Fry, look, we can still be friends
I won't ask Leela out again. Sci-fi, I try, I fly solo
Shoot your landspeeder up just like Bolo
“What's with Lars, and what's with his name?”
Never mind that ish, ‘cause I've got space game!

In 2112, all the players play on
Everyone bumps Rush and that “Tom Sawyer” song
I took the red pill, and high fived Neo
Hey what should I sample? “If it sells pick Dio!”
Yo Morpheus, look, you're a real cyber punk
But your friend Trinity has junk in the trunk
And I'm from Mars, and she's from Venus
She has ovaries and I have a light saber
‘Cause I get more play than Captain Kirk
He found out and went berserk like a jealous jerk
But no puny Vulcan death grip can paralyze me
I said beam me up Scotty, and then I got free
Princess Leia said that my flows are tight
So I said I supposed she can spend the night
A long time ago in a galaxy far away…

This song is futuristic, so hardcore
Hey T.S. Eliot! Please shut the door
Because modernism is so passé
The postmodern revolution is here to stay
In the house tonight because of Frank Lloyd Wright
The bass goes “boom!” like dynamite
“Yo, Wright was a modernist!”
Yeah I know that, all right,
But you can't rhyme “Bob Venturi' with “dynamite”
See it's Guernica Part II when I storm the stage
I draw fans like Warhol draws soup cans on the page
Did I say postmodern? Well, that was a lie!
I've been post-postmodern since junior high

CHORUS
Ezra Pound can't stop me (I'm on fire tonight)
Virginia Wolfe can't stop me (I'm on fire tonight)
Joseph Conrad can't stop me (I'm on fire tonight)
I excite the modern mind like a ray of light

What's up?
Yo, I'm going to put the song about your house on the album. Is that cool?
Uh  Yeah, I just don't want to have any, like, stalkers knowing my name, like my full name.
Do you think it's cool?
We'll keep it on the DL. We're going to spell it in the lyrics different than it is.
Alright, that's cool, yeah, whatever.

And that is what this song's about
As I write these rhymes I'm starting to doubt
This kid will ever take the garbage out
The living room is full of cans
The ping-pong table barely stands
I guess he's too busy with other demands
like Game Cube and listening to pop punk bands
There's pizza boxes stacked in the living room

No mops, no brooms, and no vacuums
Open the fridge and you might see
Half a Mr. Pibb and some moldy cheese
Upstairs the toilet barely works
That's just one of the many perks
Last time it took me half an hour
To figure out how to work his upstairs shower

John Thatcher Longley, clean up your house
John Thatcher Longley, clean up your house
My drummer has the messiest house in New Jersey
My drummer has the messiest house in New Jersey

His house makes me think about
All the things in life you can live without
Like Internet, pens, tables and chairs
There's mail stacked randomly on the stairs
The bathroom door's falling off
I went to the attic and started to cough
But every time a tour rolls by, you know we'll stay at
Laurel Drive

I mean, does it make you mad at all?
No, no, I think it's hilarious.
Alright cool, I just wanted to make sure it was cool.

Bumping indie hip hop
Calculator wrist watch
Shins t-shirt and flip flops

Queen of the hipster scene
Straight out of Vice magazine
Social outcast at sixteen
But now she lives her Boho dream

She came from Omaha to Williamsburg
She loved Karen O and she had heard
That Brooklyn was the hipster mecca
Packed her bags with her friend Rebeka

Said she had a thing for broke dudes in bands
Who lived by Union or by Grand
So we went down to the Bedford Bar
And bought a six dollar PBR

Hipster girl
Cool by the numbers and she rocks my world
Knows all the indie bands you've never heard
She's my hipster girl

She thinks uncool stuff is mad cool
Indie culture's fad rule
But cool stuff is uncool, right?
That's why Friday's Jewel night

She reads books no one has read
Laughs at jokes no one has said
So ironic with her taste
Her whole life is cut and paste

It's a metro sexual romance
She wears my shirts and I wear her pants
We play dodge ball, kid sports are cool
Watching Spank Rock and McCarren Park Pool

She's my trust fund baby bohemian
Her vegan humus keeps her thin
I love my L-Train girl, it's true
She always goes down on the weekends too

Hipster girl
Cool by the numbers and she rocks my world
Knows all the indie bands you've never heard

Your fixed gear bike makes no sense

Dad found me on the steps of the video arcade
Oprhan baby in a basket, seven pounds is all I weighed
And before I learned to walk well I'd mastered Donkey Kong
Q'bert, Final Fight, Master Blaster and Pong

Blindfolded, okay, yeah, I know it sounds adorable
But dollars signs in pop's eyes grew creepy and deplorable

He said, ""Play by the noises, follow the ding boing""
But can I walk the dog and do my homework?
First, collect coins

Kid, didn't I find you with a controller in hand?
Now why do you got to go and bring shame to your old man?
Same to your old fans, you were a child prodigy
Up on a milk crate at the cabinet, making cottage cheese

Out of anybody'd put a quarter on screen
My pride in you, extended like the limbs of Dhalsim
All green money motives must a back seat take
Put the textbooks down, I'm trying to make you great

Locked in the attic I was trained from my crib to the stroller
While dad beat me senseless with the NES controller
Kid, listen, I promise, it's for your own good
Wits that you've shown, should you level up? It's understood

I hadn't been out since '98 like Sega Saturn
I've been learning ten-hit combos and the speed run patterns
More play, less chatter, you're a champion, kid
Under your mattress there had better be some cartridges hid

Up up down down left right left right B A, mad scary
It's like Clockwork Orange meets Ray Bradbury
It's unnecessary to struggle, you're fated to win
But till you beat Bowser you stay strapped in

I wanna live a fun life, I've only seen the sun twice
I want real friends, dad, Nintendogs won't suffice
Why do you ask for nothing when the world could be yours?

I don't wanna sit here playing Doom
Three, can't you see I need to go out and play, yo
Real sports like baseball, I'm sick of Halo

Then you're sick of the meaning of life at your age
Better try a little harder, you want to clear that stage
And step into the middle of an existence examined
Do it or you're grounded, make you play backgammon

Here's a list of things that I'd rather do
Than sitting home playing Super Smash Brothers with you
Eat peas, do the dishes, walk the dog, mow the lawn
Take your wii and shove it, I'm off pops, I'm gone, peace

Don't Joust with me, kid, I'll go Berzerk

All the winnings that you earn, you're celebrity too
You wanna put us on the streets like the TV movies do

MC Lars,"Billy built a robot in his parent's garage
Because he had a list of problems that he needed to solve
He said, ""I'm sick of the Hills, Laguna Beach is fake and whack
Let's party like it's '96 and bring the horn section back""

Back before Gwen Stefani started rapping with Pharrell
Gas cost one fifteen and Goldfinger could sell
When reality TV wasn't scripted or contrived
The brass was phat and bumpin' and the beats were all played live

See, Billy was obsessed with third wave ska
The Mighty Bosstones, Reel Big Fish, Less Than Jake
He'd seen them all
He longed for a time when even Bill Clinton played the sax
On the white house lawn and kids wore shades and checkered slacks

So Billy sits back in the class and labs
Put a notebook on his lap 'cause he plans a task
To make a giant robot, how's that?
And bring the real Orange County back

This gigantic robot kills
He's gonna come down the block, he's gonna fire at will
He's got a cannon on his shoulder and a laser in his hand
He's gonna win the day for Billy, make the city understand

The robot was completed and it opened up its eyes
Weighing seven hundred pounds and standing eight foot five
With his black coat, white shoes, black hat, set to attack
The robot headed to the hills to give those spoiled kids a smack

Christoph Leary got knocked flat as Billy bumped the Aquabats
He ripped out Mischa Barton's spine to crank Save Ferris and Sublime
He burnt down Heidi Montag's home and to blast the OC Supertones
His scream was smashing LC's head, ska is not dead

This gigantic robot kills
He's gonna come down the block, he's gonna fire at will
He's blasting bullets from his elbows, shooting missiles from his eyes
He's gonna win the day for Billy, take the OC by surprise

He'll make you do the Macarena as you rock your Tamagachi
With your Newton down in Woodstock playing Sega la-di-da-di
He brought the 90's back and then he freed Tibet
If you can't find his jam on Napster then the warehouse sells cassettes

He's gonna come down the block, he's gonna fire at will
He's got a cannon on his shoulder and a laser in his hand
He's gonna win the day for Billy, make the city understand

He's blasting bullets from his elbows, shooting missiles from his eyes
He's gonna win the day for Billy, take the whole world by surprise

MC Lars,"Where ya been Lars?
Where ya been?
Where ya been Lars?
Where ya been?

I've been touring everywhere just to bring this world
Joy
On a three year long mission just to merch & destroy
I've been to Sydney, been to Dublin, been to Tokyo and
Back
Still rocking Capcom hoodies and that dirty A's cap
I'm still repping Northern Cali, hella non-conformist
I toured with Gym Class Heroes and then they got
Ginormous

I've drawn a lot of comics and I've rocked a lot of
Shows
I saw nerdcore come and I saw nerdcore go
I did a track with mc chris, though I kind of whish I'd
Knew
He'd be like ""I want three grand for that verse or I'll
Sue"" (true)
I opened for T-Pain he had zero production
He made my drummer move his drums, gave his stage

Manager instructions (move your drums)
I DJ-ed Johnny Phillips wedding, Gerard Way was there
I'm like ""We have the same booking agent"", he's like
""ask me if I care?""
I met Weird Al, I met Flava Flav
I met DMC but the photo wouldn't save
I'm like ""Camera phones suck,"" he's like ""I know
They're tricky""

He didn't actually say that, but if he had, it would
Have been good for comedy purposes.

MC Lars,"I wish I was a little bit hyphy, I wish E-40 liked me
I wish I didn't crash going ghostriding nightly
I wish I didn't have to fact the fact that I'm whack on the track, white kids aren't hyphy

got kicked out of Slim's like a week ago
For krumping in the front row, at the Anticon show
And everyone I know says I'm taking my chances
Cruising through Oakland, bumping Sage Francis?
San Jose rappers say they don't want to hear
Angry emo raps by Eyedea and Atmosphere
They hippies out in Berkeley, tell me I should stop
Ghostriding my Volvo wearing Birkenstocks
So I took my dad's Lexus in the Town for a spin
Surprised him back at home with some 18 inch rims
Up at Live 105 jumping on Aaron's desk
Stop playing Mickey Avalon his concepts are a mess
Traxamillion did this beat, now he's calling on the phone
Drank too much hyphy juice and I got a kidney stone
The Bay has come back with a brand new sound
But its so hard to be retarded, I guess I'll never be down

I wish I was a little bit hyphy, I wish E-40 liked me
I wish I didn't crash going ghostriding nightly
I wish I didn't have to face the fact, that I'm whack, on the track, white kids aren't hyphy

I wish I was a little bit hyphy, not quite like Keira Knightley
I wish I had a whip for the girls rockin Nikes
I wish I didn't have to face the fact, when I'm back with the raps, white kids aren't hyphy

showed up at the sydeshow but they laughed at me
Tried to ghostride my whip but I hit a tree
And I can't get my volvo under 60 a gallon
Didn't have any thizz, so I popped a Valium
Because that's how we roll when we in the Yay Area
The rippers ride the Yellow Bus we bring the mass hysteria
I'm up in the club in my brand new stunnas
Had a seizure from the strobe so my moves got dumber
Keak da Sneak looked at me and said 'yo this kid can dance'
I was keeping it so trreal that I split my baggy pants
The I got on the mic all deaf, dumb, and hyphy
From Richmond to Vallejo rappers want to be just like me
E-40's in the scraper with his brand new slumper
Chillin with Bubb Rubb, in his tricked out hummer
Kids yell 'YEE,' the whistles go 'WOO'
Don't know what I just said on this verse, do you?

I wish I was a little bit hyphy, I wish these rappers liked me
I wish they went on myspace always typing 'bite me'
I wish I didn't have to face the fact, that I lack, the attack, white kids aren't hyphy

I wish I was a little bit hyphy, not your average white-g
Catch me in the Source, with five mics, that's unlikely
I wish I didn't have to face the fact, that I'm whack, like I rap, white kids aren't hyphy

I wish I was a little bit hyphy, I wish E-40 liked me

You stole the beat, are you having fun
Now me and the Aud's gonna show you how it's done
You are what I label as a nerve plucker
You're plucking my nerves you MC sucker
I thought I oughta tell you, better yet warn
That I am like a stock and my word is bond
Like James, killing everybody in sight
The code's three-six, the name is Lyte
After this jam I really don't give a damn
'Cause I'mma run and tell your whole damn clan that you're a

You shoulda won a prize as a Rakim sound-alike
Here's a Milkbone, a sign of recognition
Don't turn away, I think you should listen close
Don't boast, you said you wasn't bragging
You fucking liar, you're chasin' a chuckwagon
The only way you learn you have to be taught
That if a beat is not for sale, then it can't be bought
When you leave the mic, you claim it's smoking
Unlike Rakim, you are a joke and I think you ought to stop
Before you get in too deep
'Cause with a sister like Lyte, yo I don't sleep

When I'm in a jam, with my homegirl Jill
My cousin Trey across the room with a posse of girls
So I step in the middle, shake it just a little
Wait for some female to step up and pop junk
Give my cousin a cue, treat the girl like a punk
Now I'm not trying to say that I'm into static
But yo if you cause it, yep, we gotta have it
'Cause I ain't going out like a sucker no way
So I sit around the way for you to make my day
We can go for the hands, better yet for the words
'Cause you'll be ignored, and at the same time I'll be heard
Throughout the city, the town and the country
The beat is funky, my rhyme is spunky
There is no delaying in the rhyme I'm saying
Neither are there flaws in what my DJ is playing

So sit back Jack, and listen to this, it's 10% dis
'Cause I'm just about ready to fly this fist against your lips

But I'll wait for the day or night that you approach
And I'mma serve and burn ya like a piece of toast
Pop you in the microwave and watch your head bubble
Your skin just crumble, a battle's no trouble
Get my homegirls Joanie and Kiki to get stupid
This thing called hip-hop, Lyte is ruling it
I hate to laugh in your face, but you're funny
Your beat, your rhyming, your timing, all crummy
On the topic of rapping, I should write a pamphlet better yet a booklet
Your rap is weak homegirl, and it's definitely crooked

Others write your rhymes while I write my own
I don't create a character when I'm on the microphone
I am myself, no games to be played
No script to be written, no scene to be made
I am the director, as far as you are concerned
You don't believe me, then you'll have to learn
This ain't as hard as MC Lyte can get
Matter of fact, you ain't seen nothing yet
So never let me step into a party hardy
Talk to some people and then hear from somebody
You wanna battle 'cause you know where I am
You don't wanna come in the ninties and see me at a jam when a 
Mic is handy, ten feet away
I stretch my arm like elastic, head like a magnet
Set assure, you know I don't play
When it comes down to it, the nitty gritty
For a sucker like you I feel a whole lot of pity

MC Lyte,"This is Lyte, and I'm just here to say
That I choose to express my feelings this way
Always alone, either with a microphone
Or just plainly emphasize the tone of my voice
'Cause yo, I know I'm your choice
So when I am speaking, show your gratitude
While I am teaching, I have no attitude
I'm just here to get the job totally done
Eighty five percent work, fifteen percent fun
Sometimes I admit, I get so excited
Rhyme for rhyme, I just can't fight it
Can't stop the flow, it's just too persistent

(Big girls don't cry)
(Big girls don't cry)	

Can't stop the flow, it's just too persistent
The level is extremely low on my resistance
By you or any other I'll never be beaten at a
Rap meeting, in other words a battle
'Cause y'all, I'm like a farmer, and y'all's the cattle
Be a big girl about it, don't you start cryin'
That'll mean I made you weep without even tryin'
Lyte takes it like a big girl, I'm no jive girl
Comin' direct, tellin' you that I'm a live girl
I'm positive', you've heard this expression before
So next time you see Lyte shine through the door
Don't talk behind my back, confront me like a big girl

(Big girls don't cry)
(Big girls don't cry)	

Don't talk behind my back, confront me like a big girl
So I can take you to all slimmies of the world
Big girls, we don't fight over men
Although there's one worth fighting for every now and then
But then I think again, it's not worth my while
And it's also not a big girl style
And I know you're thinkin 'wait, Lyte is slim and short?'
While being brought up I was also taught
Take it like it comes and proceed with the flow
Lyte is the biggest of the big girls, and now you know

MC Lyte,"I am woman, hear me roar
When I grab the mic it's never a bore
When I'm on stage, sayin' a rhyme
I often wonder what ya think of mine
Is it fresh or weak, or is it live or dead?
Yo, it's got ta be somethin' if you're boppin' your head
To the beat, can I get an amen brother?
Liked that rhyme? Well here goes another

Hold up, hold up, hold up
Check it out, before we go any further
We gotta announce who we are
I am DJ K-Rock and this is my homegirl, MC Lyte
Kick it for 'em!

We had to pause for station identification
Now ya know my name here's some more information
Well, let's see, what you wanna know about me?
MC L-Y-T-E
(The queen) Nah, that's too corny
(The sexy) Nah, that gets the guys too horny
(The best) Now that sounds conceited
But what is true is true, so it has to be repeated
The best is Lyte, when I'm on the mic
And MC's look straight ahead cos this pitch'll make your neck tired
And I say loosen up and relax
The fiction you been livin' I'mma fill with facts
Right now

Name of the group is Me and My DJ
Kickin' it live in '88

I am woman, hear me roar
Comin' out fresher and flyer than I did before
That's right, I'm well respected
Don't get stupid, I'm well protected
If ya wanna battle I'm well prepared
Me and K-Rock are far from scared, you know what
We're brave, livin' in a cave of gold
Waitin' for the misbehaved to get bold
But as I look around so far so good
MC's behaving just like they should
Hands are folded, no whispering or passing notes
All attention to me ya have to devote
I'm like a teacher, but then again not quite
'Cause a teacher's salary I'm makin' a night
On the mic rhymes witty and bright
Maybe that's why the name is Lyte

MC Lyte,"I used to be in love with this guy named Sam
I don't know why, cause he had the head like that of a clam
But you couldn't tell me nothin, 'cause Sam was number one
'Cause to me, oh my gosh, he was one in a million
I shoulda knew the consequences right from the start
That he'd use me for my money, and then break my heart
But like a fool in love I fell for his game
But I got mine, so I show no shame
In Empire winked his eye, and then he kept walkin'
And all of those who live in Brooklyn know just what I'm talkin'
The roller disco where we all used to go
Just to have some fun back in 1981
You know the place, Empire Boulevard
Is where I first saw the nigga, and he tried to play hard
But I knew the deal, 'cause I knew his brother Jerry
And Sam, he just broke up with his girlfriend Terry
So Jerry introduced Sam and I that night
He said, ""Hello, my name is Sam"" I said, ""Hi, my name is Lyte""
We dipped and we dapped and we chit and we chat
About this and that, from sneakers to hats
He said, ""Look, I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me""
(Let's go) To my house, lay back and get nice
Watch television, Riunite On Ice
I said, ""Slow down, I know you wanna shake me down
But I'm not one of the girls to go rippin' around""

Ju-just like a test

Next month I finally went to his house
I walked into the door, there was a girl on the couch
I said, ""Who's the frog, the bump on the log?
You chump, you punk, how could you do me wrong?
Singing sad songs about your love is so strong""
You said, ""Wait Lyte, you're confused, the girl is my cousin""
Your brother agreed, but later she said that she wasn't

Forgotten, next month we went to the Deuce
Well, I thought it kinda strange 'cause you had lots of juice
You knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody
Asked ya how you met 'em, said you met 'em at a party
Then these girls tried to tell me you were sellin' the stuff
I said, ""It's not your business, so shut the fuck up""
They said, ""Okay Lyte, think what you wanna think
But it's gon' be some shit when your man becomes a fiend""
I said, ""Look, to bust a move, I don't even know you
To put it Lyte, I really don't care to""
They kinda got mad and sort of offended
They said, ""We only lookin' out for yo best interest""
I said, ""Thanks but no thanks"" in an aggravated tone
""When I wanna find out, I find out on my own""

Just like a test
Ju-just like a test
Ju-just like a test
I cram to understand you

Then my cousin said she saw you with this lady named C
Well I'm clawin' my thoughts, I wonder who she could be
You're spending all your time with her and not a second with me
They say you spend your money on her and you're with her night and day
Her name starts with a C and it ends with a K
I strain' my brain lookin' for a name to fit this spellin'
But I just couldn't do it 'cause my heart kept yellin'
Burning, begging for affection from you, Sam
But just like a test I cram to understand you
Thought I knew you well enough to call you a man, but

Just like a test
Ju-just like a test
Ju-just like a test
I cram to understand you

Then it came a time you started looking kinda thin
I asked you why, you said, ""Exercise, tryina stay slim""
I bought it, even though I knew it was a lie
'Cause it really didn't matter, you were still lookin' fly but oh no
Oh no, you started askin' me for money
Butter me up, beg me and call me your honey
So I gave you 2 yards, and then I gave you one more
You picked up your jacket and you flew out the door
You came back an hour later and you asked me for a ten
I said, ""I only got a twenty"", you said, ""Give me that, then""
I said, ""Nope, I'll tell you now, you better stop slobbin'
Find you a job, or you better start robbin""
So I stepped off with a giant step
Picked up my belongings, and I just left
And now I see you in Empire every Sunday
Juicin' the girls up for some money and a lay
But every time I see you doin' it, I just ruin it
Tell em how ya on crack, smoke, sniff, and chewin' it
And as for this girl, Miss C, oh well
I was shocked as hell when I heard, Samuel
When your homeboys told me, I almost went wack
That the girl you was addicted to, her name was Crack

So here's the microphone, let's see what you can do""
So I took the microphone and I threw it to the ground
'Cause I need no assist when it comes to gettin' down
When I start to rap, she start to shake
She knew to confront me was truly a mistake
So she picked the microphone off the grey concrete
And before I turned around, she was down the street

It's explaining, how heavy the young lady is
You know what I'm saying King?

Yes my brother, but I would consider 'Lyte as a Rock'

Talk and I'll ignore you, is it that offensive to you?
The problem is you can't understand
The logic in my rap you can't comprehend so you
Merely step aside, what all, call the weak
But you'll also step aside when I'm, comin' down the street
You'll give me lots of room, to whistle and walk
And then everything is silent just in case I wanna talk, but I
I never do, small talk I like to hear
Other girls rap and you say that I'm wack
Comin' from a female that is totally dedicated
Every rhyme I say you ought to appreciate it
And if not I'll tell you like I told my neighbor Dana Betty
What? You ain't ready
For a fly female MC you just ain't ready

Listen up everybody, listen up everybody
Listen up, everybody, it's Lyte Thee MC
Listen up, everybody, it's Lyte Thee MC

Competition I take it as food for the mind
Past experience from the future, is the best kind
Of advice that you could ever receive from another
Whether it's a stranger or your night time lover
Sorry silly rabbits, Trix are for kids
Brings back memories of the things that I did
Played jokes on suckers, just for fun
But now I'm much older, those days are done
Everything is business, forget about games you see 'cause 
Once I'm finished, you're gonna know my name is Lyte and in Brooklyn
Brooklyn's where I'm chillin'
Better known as the MC Villain
No I'm not good but I'm not bad either
Come into your life it can't get no liver

Listen up everybody, listen up everybody
Listen up, everybody, it's Lyte Thee MC

So now, competition is taken out of my vocabulary
I don't vary, I bury
Steppin' up is like diggin' your grave
So sucker MCs you ought to save
All the mess you be talkin', meanwhile hawkin'
When I'm on the stage, audience watchin'
Suckers in the corners just keep on clockin'
The way I hold the mic, the stance I use
The rhymes I recite and the beat I choose
But it's not your fault because you don't know better
You see green I wear you go buy the same sweater
You look me up and down sight the jeans name brand
You go to Macy's and for hours you stand
Online just to buy what you saw Lyte wearin'
Don't try to lie homegirl I caught you starin' 'cause yo
The beat is dope and the rhymes are kickin'
I'm the chickenhawk and you are the chicken

Listen up everybody, listen up everybody
Listen up, everybody, it's Lyte Thee MC
Listen up everybody, listen up everybody
Listen up, everybody, it's Lyte Thee MC
Listen up everybody, listen up, listen up
Listen up, everybody, it's Lyte Thee MC
Listen up everybody, listen up everybody
Listen up, everybody, it's Lyte Thee MC

You like a female MC who can handle the mike
How do I know? Because you told me so
You instantly prefer a pro to supervise the show
So that's why I'm here, don't mean to make a case of it
This rap here, well, it's just for the taste of it
I write the rap to make the whole world sing

You believe it too, that's why you never walk away

The rap is smooth, cause it's sealed with chapstick
Not gonna say that I been rappin since the day of birth
But I've acquired the knowledge like Ms. Butterworth

MC Lyte,"When you say you love me, it doesn't matter
It goes to my head as just chit chatter
You may take this egostistical or just or worry free but
What you say I take none of it seriously, and
Even if I did I wouldn't tell you so
I'd let you pretend to read me and then you'll know
'Cause I hate when one attempts to analyze 
The fact that I despize those who even try
To look into my eyes to see what I am thinking
That dream is over you gotta sink it
And I tell all of you like I told all of them
What you say to me is just paper thin, word

I'm not the kind of girl to try to play a man out
I take the money and the gear and then break the hell out
No that's not my strategy, not the game I play
I admit I play game but it's not done that way
Truly when I get involved I give it my heart
I mean my mind, my soul, my body I mean every part
But if it doesn't work out, yo it just doesn't
It wasn't meant to be you know, it just wasn't
So I treat all of you like I treat all of them
And what you say to me is still paper thin

In one ear and right out the other
hurt is mumbo jumbo lover
I don't pay attention I don't concentrate
You ain't got the bait that it takes to hook this
Sucker you missed, I put feelings aside I know who I am
My name is Lyte is your name Sam?
'Cause if it is step off, grab your coat and get lost
Wrap your scarf around your throat and go back and catch a rope and hit the road Sam
Don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Sam, don't you come back no more

So now I take precaution when choosing my mate
I do not touch until the third or fourth date
Then maybe we'll kiss on the fifth or sixth
Time to be me 
'Cause a date without a kiss is so incomplete
And then maybe I'll let you play with my feet
You could suck the big toe and play with the middle
It's so simple unlike a riddle
It's as easy as counting to 1-2-3
In other terms, letters L-why-T-E
I'll tell you, you, you and all of you

MC Lyte,"It was a café
It was a café on the westside
It was a café on
It was a café on the westside, midtown

It was a café on the westside, midtown
Said they had the best cap of cappucino around
So I stepped in, and I ordered a cup
Someone grabbed me by my throat and said, ""Shut the fuck up!""
And I did, pronto, quick fast
How much longer would the torture last?
In the wrong place, at the wrong time
It was a drug sale, I could feel from behind
Death, it was gettin closer, right behind my back
Ready to attack
I got shot in a shoot-out, and then I died
I could feel it, I was on the other side
In between lives, I'm so confused
What do I do, oh, what do I do?
But was it really time for me to go?
Why, oh why did I need cappucino?
Why, oh why?
Why, oh why did I need cappucino?
Why, oh why?
Why, oh why did I need cappucino?

Why, oh why did I need cappucino?
But then I calmed down, I spotted some friends
That I knew in a past life, way back when
A couple had died in a drug world
And this one guy died fightin over his girl
Another died drivin while intoxicated
Why do people make livin so complicated?
But then I saw a girl, her name was Mary
Introduced to drugs by her boyfriend Harry
He sold crack to the kids on the uptown corners
A social worker named Hannah Smith tried to warn her
But she wouldn't listen, no one listens
I saw the light, I awakened, it was a dream
Man oh man, you shoulda heard me scream
So glad to be given - my life back
So good to be livin - or is dead better?
I didn't have to run from the bullets or drugs
And I didn't have to run from the murderers or thugs
I didn't have to worry about fallin from a plane
But at this café was death still callin my name?
Or did this café even exist?
And was my name just another on the death list?
I knew it couldn't happen, even though
On the bottom of my shirt was a spot of cappucino...

Cappucino
Cappucino

Bust it, to some of you that really don't know
I break it down to you, the word 'cappucino'
It's somewhat like coffee, then again not quite
It's creamy and smooth, and it goes down light
They charge you 3 dollars, you ask is it worth it?
But when you start drinkin... shit, it'd be workin
I'm hooked, well, I was, cause, yo, it's the best
But if everytime I drink I voyage through death
I leave it alone and just stick to tea
Cappucino was fly, but too fly for me

Why, oh why did I need cappucino?

Why, oh why did I need cappucino?

You can cha-cha-cha to this Mardis Gras
I'm the dopest female that you've heard thus far
And I do get better, the voice gets wetter
Nobody gets hurt (as long as you let her)
Do my thing with an '89 swing
The dopeness I write, I guarantee delight
To the hip-hop maniac, the Uptown brainiac
In full effect, MC Lyte is back
And better than before as if that was possible
My competition, you'll find them in the hospital
Visiting time, I think it's on a Sunday
But notice they only get one day to shine
The rest of the week is mine
And I'll blind you with the science that the others have yet to find
So come along and I'll lead you the right way
Just clap your hands to the words I say, come on...

[Kick this one here for me and my DJ]

I've got the power to spread out and devour
At the same time I'll eat you up with a rhyme
But I'll let you slide 'cause you accidently hopped on the wrong side
Now come on, that's suicide
Hypothetically speaking
Ok, let's say you didn't know what you were doing
You're new in town, and you're looking around
For another name to ruin, and it's me that you're pursuing?
Well well well, I'll be damned
I might as well tell you who I am
I am the capital L-why-T-E
And it's shocking I'm the one you're mocking
Oh yes, I've been watching you watching me
And like the fat on your back it's plain to see
That you're a wannabe, but you can't be what you're not
So you better start living with what you got

[Kick this one here for me and my DJ]

Yeah, DJ K-Rock when you hear a scratch
Now it's time to kick a rhyme out the batch
And you're the receiver eager as a beaver
Time to convert the non-believer
That I'm a roadrunner leaving you in the dust
I can adjust to the times and at times I might just get quicker
Than the ticker of your pacemaker
More tender than a roni but harder than a jawbreaker
So don't ever second guess me
And if you're wondering who could the best be
Think a second and recollect the worst whipping you ever had yet
And I'll bet that I did it
My fingerprints are still on you
How many times I gotta warn you
About the light?  It'll blind your sight
But the rhythm will still guide you through the night

Examine the style used in this sequence
The rhyme's the clue, the record's evidence
To the fact that I'm hypin this episode
Cold carryin the extra wide load

The beat is fat and the rhyme is thick
All over the town you hear the sound and pick
Me, the L the why the t the e
Me, and if you see the Rock, I'm sure you'll see

Me (Hey Lyte, what will you be doin?)
Kickin it, bashin down competition
And when I drop the bomb, you'll listen
Boom! Now that I've got your attention

I'm slammin what you want to hear
I just thought that I should mention
'89 is the Lyte year
Now's the time to roll like a rhinoceros

Step to Lyte, that's preposterous
I'm heavyweight, though I'm lightweight
My looks the hook, my rhymes the bait
And when I throw the line you proceed to take

The goody, the treat that I hand you
That you couldn't refuse
Damn, I cram to understand you
Your love is to Lyte to lose

[Verse 2]
I think you deserve this, you waited long enough
For a rhyme that's super-duper extra tough
Every human is lurkin and loomin
Puba on the beat and you know the shit is boomin

Tasty like pastry, fresh from the bakery
First Priority, that's the way it has to be
Feel the drum, I bet it makes your body numb
One for all, and all for one I bet you come

Hurry, hurry, step right up and see the show
MC Lyte and K-Rock are about to throw
Get on line and purchase your ticket
(Hey, don't worry) Lyte is gonna kick it

(Go on, be happy) I put you up on the scoop
Now come and watch the party hoop

[Verse 3]
I am the Lyte, and it is time for me to go
You want to beef, save that shit for the toilet bowl
I use styles, styles and much many styles
I leave smiles, smiles and much many smiles

On the people who come to see the Lyte perform
(Word is bond)
The rhyme will kick as the brain will tick
You can tell because the record'll sell

Old styles and new styles formatted together
Bold or dull, so it doesn't matter whether
Which comes first or vice-a versa
It won't make a difference, as long as you rehearse-a

Get it down pat, and come right and exact
MC Lyte is comin right and I'ma say goodnight

A friend of mine (Which one?) Cecilia
(Yeah?) has a man (so?) a dealer
(Which one?) Born - Born Supreme
You know the type (Yeah, I know what you mean)
Gold and cars (cars and gold
The more he got, yo, the more he sold
He told her he loved her (Huh, gased her head)
Her love he bought just to warm his bed
I tried to tell her, but it went out the other ear
She didn't want to hear, what I had to say
She just replied this way
(Girl, I love him, he treats me so good
He gets much respect in my neighborhood)
I cram to understand why she wants this man
(Yo, he sold the crack to Sam...)

[ CHORUS ]
	(I used to be in love...)	
	But not with a dealer
	(I used to be in love...)
	I know how it feels
	(I used to be in love...)
	You make love while he makes deals

The story gets worse, they threaten her life
A guy walked on her (Yo, come here) with a knife
And said (Being with Born is a big mistake
It's a shame your life I have to take
If you leave him now, you'll be alright
If not, you won't make it through the night)
She came to me and said (Lyte, what do I do?)
Forget about Born, or else you're through (Ahh...)
She said (But, but I love him!) Hm, I wonder
Is love worth bein six feet under?
Nope (And that's on the real tip)
I think it's time you skip
Town (Hey girl, don't hang around
Or else you'll be goin -)

[ CHORUS ]

Miss see said (No, I'm stayin with my man
He stands by me, so I too must stand)
Girl, you're stupid, you're gonna take a fall
( *phone rings* ) and then she received a call 
(Hello? Listen, baby, they got a contract on me
I know because Brian warned me
I'm outta here, goin back to Cali
Grab your stuff and meet me in the alley)
She grabbed her stuff, the gold and the cash
Headed for the door in a flash
She said (I'm outta here) Now wait just a minute
You know he's a dealer, his windows are tinted
(Naw) He has truck jewelry, and no job
(So?) Carries ducats in ??? (So what?)
Now hell the hell does he get these things?
(I don't know!) The Gucci, the Louis, the Polo rings
(Yeah?) Dealers are bad news, take it from Lyte
They say they kill you, and they might
(You're right, Lyte, you tell no lie
Just let me go say good-bye)
She ran down the stairs in a minute or more
I heard a thunderous roar
( *shots* ) Born and Cecilia - killed by Uzis
See why it pays to be choosy?

I met a guy named Tommy, damn, he charmed me
Met him at the mall, but I knew he wouldn't harm me
We exchanged numbers, hopin to meet again
We couldn't wait for the romance to begin
The relationship grew strong
I didn't want to be right if this love was wrong
But oh no, came the problems, the first segment
The dumb kid went and got some girl pregnant
The second segment: started wheelin and dealin
Didn't give a damn about how Lyte was feelin
But then he got wise, started treatin me better
Cause all of his friends said I was a go-getter
He knew he was usin me, and abusin me
He also knew that soon he'd be losin me
First I clocked him, yeah, I docked him
But I rocked him - and then I dropped him

[ VERSE 2 ]
Then there was Dave, couldn't behave
So I punished him and put him in my Lyte-as-a-rock cave
Then he got bold, tried to play insane
So Bigfoot threw him off my paperthin train
He tried to 10%-dis me, but he pissed me off
Cause I'm the boss, and you know I'm not havin it
Lyte is too dope, and you know I ain't crabbin it
Then there was Henry, way too friendly
I needed a trip, he said he would send me
Pay my airfare, if he could come with me
I said, ""Listen, honey, I don't need your money
Believe me when I tell you, I've got my own
Cause I'm MC Lyte on the microphone""

Here's another story: a dude named Corey
When I used to work, yes, I was a clerk
At the Worldtrade Center, back in high school
This little player musta thought I was a fool
He took me out to lunch, offered me a ride home
When we got there, he asked could he use my telephone
I said, ""Yeah, sure"", flipped him to the floor
Cause he said ""What's up?"" and tried to feel my butt
I kicked him down the stairs and said, ""What you're provin?""
Rolled him to his car and said, ""Get movin!""
He tried to score it, I wasn't goin for it
You can't play me, I'm Lyte Thee MC
Never saw his face again until last week
All beat up and bleedin down the street

You have all waited, now you can stop waiting
Shall I ease into the disses, go 20, then 30
Or shall I got straight to 80 percent?
Aw, it doesn't matter, when you're dissed, you're dissed

When you should really ask: where is the father?
(Where is the father?) of your child, aren't we wild?
You get around like a cab, now that's too bad

You ain't gettin loose, you fuckin jerk
And you ain't gettin paid, you're just gettin laid
Sexin and suckin, yeah, that is your trade
Put on this earth just to distract me
Get those to write rhymes and try to attack me
You will get nowhere, the Lyte is too blinding
Tell me, why must I keep reminding
You to step back, let the Lyte shine
Do not take shit till you write your own rhymes

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Your mold is fake, crayola, crayon
Don't dare to sleep or even prey on
The Lyte is too wicked, too worthy, too strong
And the rhymes I create are made to last long
Let me wise you up, rappin isn't a sport
You either have to teach yourself, or you have to be taught
And being that you are not wise enough to do it on your own
The ones that write your rhymes might as well hold your microphone
Dropped a little vinyl, now you think you're large
Step aside, Lyte Thee MC is in charge
Don't sleep on me, I'm far, far, far from dumb
So roll correctly if you decide to come
MC sucker, this is what you waited for
I'm sick of the battle, let's go to war
Why do you challenge me, Lyte Thee MC
Did not you know that I am crazy?
My screws are quite loose, in fact I don't have any
But when it comes to rhymes, I've got many
Like I said and will have to say
Over and over, cause you disobey
Here on this earth I reign superior
One of these days I will have to get with ya
Tear you up mentally, from limb to limb
Cause I am the Lyte, and you are just paperthin

[ VERSE 4 ]
I sensed it, predicted it, knew it would happen
You plopped off fast on the scene and start rappin
Now it is my duty, to all MC's
To ask you to go elsewhere, pronto, please
Now I was quite polite, nice I might add
But you insist on stayin, that makes me mad
But then again I don't mind, I've got someone to pick on
Write rhymes to diss and even play tricks on
You ain't really down, you wig-wearin clown
Burrowin money to buy an outfit
Not even good enough for a Sunday picnic
I ask you: do you know who you're fuckin with?
With those bubble gum jeans and those 2 for 1 skips
I'm MC Lyte a/k/a MC Payback
Payback is a bitch, and I'm givin you no slack
Unfinished Business, that shit was wack
So Lyte made no attempt to strike back
But here we go again, what is Light's Out?
Let me ask what the bomboclut you a-chat about?
Let me say next time that you feel pissed
I suggest that you don't try to diss

You better watch what you say to me, cause I can get evil
The things that I'm capable of are unbelievable
In 10% I popped your head in a microwave
I'm into blenders now, so you better behave
Or put you in a toaster, because you're gettin toasted
Better yet an oven, because you're gettin roasted
Don't listen to your rhyme writers, cause yo, they souped you
You ain't dope, you can't cope, they musta dooked you
You musta had some wack crack (real wack crack)
Sent you on a mission, and now you're comin back
But let me school ya, Lyte is runnin this show
So yo, hoe, I think you oughta go
Before Lyte Thee MC gets into it (into it)
But remember, you forced me to do it

I'm rhymin and designin, also creatin
The dope def rhyme that is always being taken
By a sucker MC that wants to be like me
No trait of originality
But yo, I am not one to down another
So like I said before, just go for yours, sucker
I'm gonna take the time to drop a dope line
Or maybe even two, for you and your crew
So you can start shakin and movin all around
To the Lyte Thee MC and the King Of Chill sound
It's new and improved like a freshly cut diamond
Perfect timin, like a gem it's shinin
Or better yet a ruby, somewhat like a saphire
This jam you are forced to admire

	Stop, stop
	Look, look
	Listen

want to battle me? Now that's strange behaviour
Drink and drive, yeah, you're probably safer
Cause when I start, I never give slack
You feel like a 'kick me' sign was pinned to your back
Yes I'm the super-duper with the roper-doper
Got the clean drawers on, yeah, I hope ya
Do, because I'm gonna strip you of your peace of mind
Now your piece is mine, damn, that's unkind
Come on, admit it, the Lyte is too fly
The rhymes that I say you can't deny
Because 100% is what I give it (Say what?) 
I haunt the house with the hip-hop spirit
I tear it, repair it
Like a hand-me-down make you wear it
Save all your crocodile tears, grin and bear it
And with all your other brothers you're gonna share it
You hear me, junior? Cause soon you'll
Be a grown man with the mic in your hand
Adn understand biting's not part of the plan
That's wrong, I thought I taught you better than that
But that's what you get from a stabber in the back

	Stop, stop
	Look, look
	Listen

Rappin is the activity
Rhyme is the sport, let it be taught
That Lyte Thee MC is takin no shorts
In '88 I was great, but '89 is my time
Stop, look, and listen - to the right rhyme
K-Rock the DJ throws the cuts my way
Put em on the reel-to-reel and let them play
Leg 1 and Leg 2, they do the jumpin
The dancin, the pumpin, always up to somethin
But when it comes to the rap category
MC Lyte headlines the story

Yeah, now what about that dope stuff?
Alright, now give me a 808
Now let the beat roll..

[ VERSE 1 ]
Any competition, checkers or chess
Whatever the game, Lyte'll never fess
But did you say rappin? Cause I'm with it
I hold the title, you might as well forget it
You can put me to the test, I'll prove I am the best
You'll be the last coockoo to fly over the nest
Try to dis this? Nah..
You'll be the only scarface in the place
Cause I'll rip out your eyes, cut your tongue off
You can't talk no more and let the bullshit walk
In this lifetime you're no MC
You're just labelled in bold black ink as a want to-be
Now that I pulled your card and I read you
I should punish those that misled you
Into thinkin that you was just too good
I beat your ass in your own neighborhood
I have yet to threaten you with sticks and stones
That'll hurt your bones

[ CHORUS ]
I'm just throwin words at you

I step in a jam, they know who I am
All I do is smile and the crowds go wild
MC Lyte's on top of the pile
Waitin to put a sucker in her place
Won't hesitate to dis a bitch to her face
Cause you're a half-assed MC, a part-time hooker
When talent was given out, they overlooked ya
I rock ya blindfolded, better yet with no mic
Hype it acappella, make your deejay go on strike
This kinda comp I know you're not ready for
You're just a amateur dying to explore
Territory that is soon to be conquered by Lyte
Tonight, alright, alright, alright, alright..

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
I think you better leave now, your mommy is callin you
Rap is like a pit and your whole crew is fallin through
But once I'm gone there ain't no catchin me
I'm talkin bon voyage, I mean you're history
I'm takin my fans to a new land
If anyone can do it, Lyte Thee MC can
Because I'm hypin my rhyme to a new hype
So get equipped and prepare yourself for the flight
Cause yo, you're about to enter a new dimension
Sit back and listen, Lyte is on a mission
I'm takin out those who attempt to oppose me
And even those that try to get close to me

I'm too old?  What's with that crap?
Come on now brother, age is just a number
Anyway what matters is your state of mind
And if you give me some time I'll make your heart all mine

I don't like pushin' and I don't like rushin'
But most of all I don't like fussin'
So come on now sweetie why don't ya stop frontin'
Besides older folks come equipped for good lovin'

Are you really serious?  Age really matters?
I thought telling you this, you would be flattered
Well I guess I was wrong cause you still ain't widdit
... oh well, forget it, nope nope

But don't you dare touch me, you said you wasn't with it
You waited too long now, Lyte is not havin' it
I could of showed you things, taught you how to explore
My question is, what are you too young for?

I could pf shown you things that you never seen before
Took you all around on my wild world tour
But you're too young, too young to have fun
... oh well, I'm done

[MC Lyte]
It may sound nasty and it may sound mean
But I'm into little boys that are about seventeen
I don't know why, but they put up a fight
And hot damn that excites the MC Lyte

'Cause yo I love a young buck, that give a firm {fuck}
But once in a while, they become lovestruck
But that's okay though, cause I can handle them
I love young boys on the brink, of being young men

I mold em, shape em, make em then I break em in
They get the job done, I make em get the job done
Well, swell, make em kiss and tell
All of their friends around the neighborhood

That Lyte is GOOD, soul food GOOD
So tell me honey, are you ready to score?
Again I'll ask, what are you too young for?

Last but not least yo here's a description
Hard workin', not one that sells prescription
So if you're in school, that's okay
Get straight A's and I'll be back on Friday

You won't miss me, you know where to find me
And these words I will say finally
Never let age, restrict you from what you want to do
Whether you're young or ninety-two

So if you're seventeen or around that age..
... baby come to the stage
And if I didn't change your mind I'd find that odd

MC Lyte,"There's a song that I sing
Whenever I'm sad, feelin' bad

It was a date, a simple little fuckin' date
Or so I thought, wasn't that my great mistake?
He picked me up at eight from my crib
We went to dinner and he ordered Babyback Ribs

What a waste, a waste of the mind and body
And then he said, ""Lyte, would you like to go and party?""
I thought about it and then I said no
Pay for my food, motherfucker and let's go

He said, ""My, aren't we aggressive?""
Damn right and I'm also perceptive
I know your kind, you roam around the fuckin' town
You wanna slap it, flip it and rub it down

You want some booty but you're gettin' none this way
You better ask Suzy, Sally or that girl, Fay
You gets none, you hear me you cheesy rat?
Because I'm Lyte and I'm havin' none of that

I'm all that, yes, I'm all that
You ask how? I'm all that now
I'm all of that, yes, I'm all of that
And rollin' through your hood with a baseball bat

First I head out into the red eyed
Turn the AC on, so it feels cool inside
Step in the jam, baring good news
Although for some folks I bring the blues

Always solo, no relyin' on a posse
I see what you see, do you see what I see?
I see suckers, many pucker uppers
Asskissers as well as buttlickers

Many, many that will do me good and plenty
Don't know me from Adam but wanna get with me
Claimin' they will do or have done or have did me
Talkin' that yang, your ass'll get slapped
Because I'm Lyte and I'm havin' none of that

Ladies and gentlemen

I'm all that, yes, I'm all that
You ask how? I'm all that now
I'm all of that, yes, I'm all of that
And rollin' through your hood with a baseball bat

That, that

Aiyyo, milk, aiyyo, milk, this is Teddy be
Yo, I just checked out Lyte's new cut
(That, that)
And, yo, it's all that, all that
Yo, I get with you, peace

Back, way back when shit wasn't funny
I'm talkin' L Q days, your golds and your money
If you wore gold the shit was gettin' taken
Hard rocks, don't even bother fakin'

'Cause they can sense a sucker as soon as they saw ya
And oh well, how I felt sorry for the
Razor in my pocket for my protection
Blackjack in my bag for a little selection

You got beef? Bitch, chose your weapon
I sliced and diced and then I kept steppin'
For me to go for that woulda just been whack
Because I'm Lyte and I'm havin' none of that

I'm all that, yes, I'm all that
You ask how? I'm all that now
I'm all of that, yes, I'm all of that
And rollin' through your hood with a baseball bat

(That, that)
Yo, yo, Lyte, you there?

Yo, and don't make that shit soft, alright? Yo, pump it up
Alright, when you get in just give me a buzz

I'm takin it to the extremes
New blend, I've been schemin
Raw type stuff I know you've been fiendin

for MC Lyte to drop another dope rhyme
Well I deliver as quick as you call my name
I'm beyond the hype, beyond the fame

So now, I prove to you
That I can shake you groove you and move you too
I am, too much to bear
to touch and then share

Once you've had one taste one touch one bite
All you want is M-see Lyte!
And I deliver as quick as you call my name
I'm beyond the hype, beyond the fame

We've got to try to move beyond
I'm comin
We've got to try to break on through

We've got to try to move beyond

Can't, you, see, I'm beyond the hype
And all that type of jazz and pizazz
I'm, into, reality
Forget the fantasy, this is me

Beyond the hype, so don't believe
what you read, cause they'll deceive
So now I come to you
telling no lies, the truth is in my eyes

Unlike the broadcasters on the news
who try to tell you, the donts and the do's
The media blows things out of proportion
The public's eye, proceed with caution

It's a dog eat dog world
but we'll be alright
All we gots to do is stick together
and move beyond the hype

[Chorus: x2]

You, must, trust when I say I'm here to stay
and believe I'll never leave
Haste, makes, waste
The track is all that, so pick up the pace

Forget the rumors, gossip, shit-talk
Besides that's old news, and that can walk
I'm beyond that, you are also
Release the negative vibe and let it go

So now, I come to you
Bearing gifts that certainly uplift
From coast to coast, Midwest I'm the most
but still, not on a high post

I'm comin, just call my name
Beyond the hype, beyond the fame
Down to Earth, I'm just that type
to take you and move beyond the hype

I'm comin' [Repeat: x3]

Brooklyn's in the house, so come on now

Long Island is in the house, say what?

The Bronx is in the house, uh

I just toot the whistle and you go fetch them
Bring them back into the real rap attack
Set the soft silly stuff back on the rack

Tell the silly mothers that we do give a
I'm not a psychic but you can tell your sidekick
In ninety-one, Lyte is kickin' some fly

Take it from me, or could you really take it?
And if you got away with it, would you really make it
In the world of hip-hop, frontin' like you're me?
C'mon now Hobbes, that I could never see

So just step aside and feel it tonight
'Cause comin' to a store near you is M.C. Lyte

Who's that bad? Who's that bad?

I'm bigger than Bono, see I go solo
Broader than broad, see how I soared
The big bad sister from around your way
I'm not tall but I'm small don't matter what I weigh

I kick the copacetic rhyme from the down to earth mind
I get hip with the hop I'm the tip from the top
I go all out, you never see me fall out
Although you hear me yell out, you never see me sellout

Because my rhyme's about a profit, no one can stop the one
Funky lyrics synced with M.C. Lyte 'cause I be droppin' it
The name the Lyte because my skin I'm blacker than black
Comin' right and exact, for the rap attack

Some say they don't like the words I choose to use
I don't give a damn, Lyte will never loose
I ain't no sucka and I ain't into pleasin'
Some critic that criticizes me for no reason

What's with the opinion it's a stated fact
I rule the pack, from the top of the stack
So fuck the stocks and bonds I'm your new investment
Pick up the album it's quite a refreshment

Compared to the day to day bullshit you hear
Pay attention and listen I'm comin' clear to the ear
For all you non believers and you perpetrators
That talk to me now but talk about me later

It's time for you to grieve, grovel in your sorrow
I'm the star of today and the star of tomorrow
I'm takin' out the old jacks, rippin' up the new ones
I don't care if it means I have to ruin

I will and I shall and I get the job completed
Those that don't belong they will be deleted
From the rap roster, I'm not an impostor
I'm comin' to you live with the forty five

The whole three four five six seven eight nine
In the pocket, bursting in the air are rockets
Creating lots of Lyte, get it?
How many different ways can I say it?
Piano Man, how many ways can you play it?
I spell it out, the L-why-T-E
Without a doubt, ""Got to be funky!""
And it damn sho' nuff is
It gotta be like that, in this rough biz

MC Lyte,"He knows he's leaving, not much time left
Holding on to his very last breath
I saw him last week, nervous and uptight
Losing sleep, stays up all night
Wishin he woulda used his mind and not rushed
to push in the bush but took his time
to get to know the girl he slapped skins with
shared needles with
Wish he could go back, change the direction
But now he's got the infection
I spoke to him, gave him inspired words
I'm sure he's heard
live by the sword, die by the sword
What's left, pray to the oh Lord
You can deny but the truth will unfold
because the eyes are the soul

	Eyes are the soul..
	Eyes are the soul..

I look into his eyes, but he's so high
from the crack, he thinks that he can fly
He has problems he doesn't like solving
Takes one hit, and thinks the world stops revolving
19, his eyes full of tears
He hasn't smiled at least for a year
His mom is gone cause he was high one night
while they killed her, because of the crack pipe
He's wanted by the law
because he's robbed at least three grocery stores
He's lost, all control
Take a look, eyes are the soul

	Eyes are the soul..
	Eyes are the soul..
	Eyes are the soul..

I look into her eyes, she's so young
but I know, where she's comin from
I've watched her grow, little girl down the street
White shirts and skirts with pleats
She cried, fear in her voice
Not knowing, she had a choice
Oh so sad, oh so lonely
If she knew that she's not the only
one in school that didn't use the caution
Facin, raisin a baby or abortion
Her mother said she had to leave
Who wants to be where a baby is not received
No ultimatum, she's goin to the G.Y.N.
to put it to an end
She's learned a lesson I suppose

MC Lyte,"Outside of me, you try to picture me
Young and black, that ain't no mystery
But inside runs deep like an ocean
You couldn't understand if I spoke in slow motion

I'm tryin' like hell to get some results
But you can bet your ass that it's difficult
They try to keep it down because I talk to a beat
In other words because I try to teach

But if I talk that yang-yang shit
Like you can't touch this, that shit'll hit
Don't we have any morals anymore
Or did rap take the toll out the fuckin' door?

Well if it did, hardcore's back to claim it
I'ma take it, change it, fuck it, rename it
I got the plan, now let's make it effective
You hip-hoppers, you got to be selective

And stop lettin' that bullshit slide for rap
Can't you see that it's a brainwash trap?
I rap a cha, cha, cha and I sat and watched
You liked that shit, you rock around the fuckin' clock

But when I talk of education, you fear that
Drugs and such, you don't wanna hear that
First I pleased you, now I teach you
Don't you dare try to bite the hand that'll lead you

To the pot of gold, over the rainbow
Lyte'll guide you, I know the way to go
So just close your eyes and just take my hand
Remember MC Lyte has the master plan
We can go thick, in a posse
You ain't said nuttin' slick, I'm goin' kamikaze

Inside of me, you try to picture me
Can you detect, can you see I'm angry?
Well, usually Lyte don't get upset
But when I see wack shit gettin' pressed I get vexed

Turn on the video, what's this mess?
A disgrace to rap and I'm not impressed
So just leave, get out my domain
You lame sucker, you fuckin', no name

Takin' up my airtime, with that weak whack
Full of, full of bullshit rhyme
So step off roach or get stepped upon
Because my rhymes they spray like D-Con 4
Do you want more?

'Cause I floor any emcee
That wanna gets with me
So yo, pack your bags, and skedaddle
Just walk, 'cause you don't wanna battle

I got the button that'll get rid of wack emcees
It's called the Brooklynizer, have you beggin' on your knees
So quit takin' up space on the CD rack
You better prepare, 'cause Lyte gives no slack

Inside of me, dwells a hundred maniacs
Waitin' for the kickoff, waitin' for attack
Who gives a fuck? Bring your posse
'Cause in the 90's, Lyte is goin' kamikaze

Inside, there's no flipside
Outside there's more than meets the eye
So now you know not because you're guessin'
But because I told you so, I never fess

Everyone wants to rap, what's this a wagon?
Bring your band and hop and start draggin'
All you rappers, you're fuckin' impersonators
Sayin' I'll rap now and learn how to rap later

No time for that, time is too short
And the rappin' gift it cannot be bought
A solo artist? You can't be
Maybe you'll look better with a posse

But all that you're talkin', you ain't sayin' shit
So why you where you at? I think you oughta quit
Posses don't matter in the 90's
Here's a warning, Lyte is goin' kamikaze
",Kamikaze
MC Lyte,"Fifteen years old, thought I was in love
I was never told, sex is like drugs
Too much will drive you crazy, in fact
The brother was so good, had me comin' back
Took my virginity, like he took my heart
I had to find the Lyte, he left me in the dark

All alone, no one to be with
And the brothers they ask me why I riff
I got hard, grew a shell upon my back
I had to get a grip, to keep my life intact
I had to let em know, Lyte is not fragile
'Cause if they think this, brothers can get, foul

they'll use, bruise and abuse
Dump your ass and be sure to choose
The next fresh fish that steps into the place
If they desire, they forgot your face
Lovin' them and leavin' them, that was their reasonin'
Thinkin' he was pleasin' you, when he was just teasin' you

Summer was over, back in school
He said come over, that would be cool
I said okay, it?s been a year now
Some even asked why, some even asked how
Could you wait that long, for me to be with it
Some said yo hobbes, you're never gonna get it

But then the time came, you and I both came
Things would soon change, never would they be the same
Before this afternoon, took place, I was in love, I walked around
In space, I?d rush home from school just to speak to you

Talk for an hour, maybe even two
We?d just laugh though, nothing serious
I guess back then, you were just curious
To see what I was like, just to touch my flesh
I could be wrong though, that's my first guess

You was in your house, I was in mine
As long as we were chattin' on the line, it was fine
All alone, yet talkin' on the phone if you got bored you felt your bone
And as bad as I am, I talked you through every stroke
Lyte ain't no joke

you've been beggin' for some time, for me to come visit
You never got mad though, if I wasn't widdit
But this day was different, I was feelin' in the mood
For some slow type of groove or some soul food

In other words sex, yeah that's better
I threw on the Jordache, the izog sweater
That was in style then, come on don't laugh
Sergio?s, Lee?s, you wore those in the past
Anyway I arrived, twenty past five

he'd been hypin' himself, sayin' he was quite live
I said here's your chance, show me some romance
We begin' to slow dance, off with his pants
Boom it was over, damn that was quick
Too bad little homey had a widdle widdle

The only one I've seen, 'cause yo he was the first
But since I've had others, damn he was the worst
I was in love though, that didn't matter
Nothin' you could say, could ever shatter
My world, take it away, just a young little girl

Oh well, he stepped, jet, family moved
Leavin' me in the mood for some soul food
Damn I felt hurt, just like a jerk
Would somebody please just mush my face in dirt
So I can hide, from the whole fuckin' world
What the fuck is love, such a naive girl

Suppose I got pregnant, damn I?d be lost
My mom woulda kicked me out to live with jack frost
I guess I'm lucky though, lonely for sure
Waitin' for the fucker to come knockin' at my door
I didn't hold my breath though, I might be dead
Yo 45, next time I?ll use my head
",Like a Virgin
MC Lyte,"Ready?
No
Oh
Puppy, power

Okay, hello
Watch your drink, what? Watch your drink
No, no, I think I'm too late, am I too late?

Hit it, I'm coolin' in the sun, on a beach in the cabana
Sippin' on some vodka in a glass with Tropicana
I'm chillin' and I'm chompin' on a turkey shish-ka-bab
Too far from work to hear the phone ring at the job

Men in bikinis, G-strings should I say
Waitin' for the daddy long one to come my way
Here he comes, now, I feel I start to sweat
Blunder but I wonder just how wet will I get

He offers me his hand, of course you know, I take it
Until he tells me that he wants to swim a little naked
My eyes are bulgin', I black out, damn, it's black as tar
Woke up, I don't know when, sittin' at the bar

I know it's hard to follow, the story's kinda tricky
What I didn't know was somebody slipped a Mickey
Into my drink, which caused a fantasy
And somehow slapped me back into reality

Wish I had another Mickey, I'd go back for a quickie
Find the daddy long one that was surely tryin' to get me
This just goes to show, you must stop and think
When you're out partyin', never leave your drink, word

MC Lyte,"I met him in a club hangin out one night
He said, ""Hello I'm George.. hi Lyte!
How's everything goin, huh, how ya doin?
Hope everything's fine, ooh, and umm
can I call you sometime?  Can I get the digits?
And the address, so I can come visit?""
I gave him the digits, that wasn't a problem
Cause if he caused any, I would have to solve them
cause George looked good, MMM damn good!
And if I didn't, some other girl would
In my mind, I hope for the best
Convincing myself that this was not a test
Cause I heard many things about Georgie
Nothing kinky, like no orgies
I heard he knows how to make love
like an angel from the heaven above
Who was I kidding I'd give him a try
Cause Lyte needs love too and that ain't no lie
Keep your ears open, hope that you listenin
Cause I'm about to take you on a George Porgie mission

     ""Can it be I've stayed away too long"" (2X)

I gave him the number, I saw it in his eyes
""She gave me the number?  Hmmm I'm surprised""
Good conversation, over the phone
He began to come for me whenever I was alone
George was sweet, so nice and so neat
With any other guy he didn't have to compete
George was mature, he made sure
that he was the only one I'd ever adore
Girls, have you, ever had a friend
that you'd get with, every now and then?
I know for a fact George had a lot of girls
spread out from state from state around the world
As long as he was smart and kept his girls in check
Made sure I never saw them and showed me respect
He didn't have to be loyal, like men should be
I don't care about the other girls, just be good to me!
But if I ever saw one, that would be the end
He couldn't kick the storyline that she was just a friend
The girls I didn't care, fine legs don't lie
See cause Georgie was into making your girls cry

     ""Kissed the girls and made them cry"" (4X)

     ""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
     ""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
     ""Kissed the girls and made them cry""

     ""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
     ""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
     ""Kissed the girls and...""

George was clean, no drugs and such
But once in a while, he'd drink too much
Hangin in a club where they play rockers
Him and his friend, drinkin vodka
I was lookin for him, and I found him there
With his clothes messed up and his (fucked) up hair
I told him he was messin up he wouldn't go far
He got mad and asked his friend for the keys to the car
I said, ""Don't drive, use your head
Drive while you're drunk and you'll kill yourself dead""
We begin to argue, bad words were said
Then he got kicked out by some longhaired dread
Ran into the car as if, in a hurry
He started the car but his vision was blurry
He didn't care, he drove off into the night
Riding for miles, without his headlights
Georgie Porgie had too much on his mind
He was still young yet running out of time
Last week he took tests as the doctor told him
George had cancer in his lungs and his colon
See when he was young, he started smokin
Paid no attention when he started chokin
Thoughts flashed through his head, there they stuck
Till Georgie Porgie, crashed into a truck
I wished I woulda told him how I liked him so much
How he made me feel with the slightest touch
Now he's gone and I can't tell him nothin
Wish he was here so I could say somethin
The story is not to say that I'm in sorrow
Just to say no one is promise tomorrow
If you love someone you should say it often
You never know when they'll be layin in a coffin
Wake up, it's important that you know that
No one on Earth is promised tomorrow..
Believe that!  And don't think that it can't happen to you

One by one they fall in the darkness
I'm glad, that I could take part in this
And I'm hoping, that you just might
Get together and Search 4 the Lyte

Finding the Lyte means happiness
It's the best and nothing less
So I'm waiting, at the end of a tunnel
Where happiness comes in bundles

But it takes time, to get to the Lyte
To get in the Lyte, to be with the Lyte
And I'm hoping, that you just might
Get together and Search 4 the Lyte

How you get there is this question
Honesty is my suggestion
But first you must be awakened
If you say you are, you're faking

One who has seen the Lyte doesn't have to proof
That they've been moved
They just let it be, let it rest
For that is the mental test

Within this, there's so much happiness
Sort of like lasting moments of bliss
Everyone wants to be so happy
Let me explain my theory:

Some type of grief you MUST experience
In order to appreciate happiness
'Cause if you are always satisfied
Life will just pass by, you would've never tried

To get to the Lyte, to get in the Lyte
To be with the Lyte, to go see the Lyte
And I'm hoping, that you just might
Get together and Search 4 the Lyte

If you are not ready the Lyte can be BLIND-ING
And not worth finding
So for this you must prepare:
Stay awake, wake up, stay aware!

There are SO, many distractions
Those that see the Lyte, just a fraction
Those that don't, remain blinded
The Lyte is there, they can't find it

One by one they fall in the darkness
And it's sad, to take part in this
But I'm hoping, that you just might
Get together and Search 4 the Lyte

Now finding the Lyte is what's so difficult
And you can bet, that the results are
Splenderous, wonderful, yeah
What wouldn't you do?

'Cause once you've seen the Lyte, been with the Lyte
Got to the Lyte, got in the Lyte
I know that you just might
Never ever want to leave the Lyte",Search 4 the Lyte
MC Lyte,"Now you called my house and you said come over
Your mother and your father are gone, and you're alone
With Rover the dog, but now you're fronting
You said if I come you'd give me something
So don't start playing around cause I'm serious
What did you call me for cause I'm curious
Or did you call me just to look in my face
Now I know I didn't come just to take up space
The night is right, and the stars are bright
So see'mon now brother just treat me right
And just take it off, I mean everything
Hurry up pretty boy so that we can SWING
I don't smoke and I don't get high
But if I say I don't love well that would be a lie
Because I do every chance I get
But if I don't I won't fall I won't fret
I'm no fool I got plenty of sense
So I just be cool, and have patience
Make up your mind, please let me know
And when you give me the green that's when I'll go
So please pretty boy don't hesitate
And entice me nice and cooperate
You tried the rest and I tried the best
And when the time comes boy no regrets
And just take it off

Now take off your hat, untie your shoelace
And after you finish, I want you to face me
Now baby, don't get scared
Cause I'm not like the other girls so don't compare me
Tender loving care is all I give
And if possible boy, well I would like to live with you
And if I do it ain't everybody's business
It seems to me ya just how you got into this
Take it off, cause I'm ready to rock
Like Maxwell baby, until the last drop
Cruising down the street in my SL
When I seen this dude who was built very well
Face was handsome, body was fine
How did I know, I was cruising behind him
Looked at the car, looked at me
Then he asked me my name, I told him Lyte the MC but
I didn't want to outplay my hand
So I talked so smooth he could understand me
He was definitely the move
I only said sweet things, that could soothe him
Opened up the door, and he got in
And automatically my mind just turned to sin
I told him take it off, I mean everything
Hurry up pretty boy so that we can swing
I mean take it off, cause I'm ready to rock
Like Maxwell baby until the last drop

Met this guy at an amusement park
He was good to go and it was after dark
You can guess girls what was on my mind
Let's go under the boardwalk and have a good time baby
Instead the boy asked me my sign
And I said, ""Why?"" and he said, ""Never mind.""
When the time come and it's you I'm thinking of
A sign don't make a difference only how you make love to me
You make me feel so good you're a man
Oh baby I melt like cotton candy
If I could predict the rest of my life
I'd be a millionaire and I'd also be your wife
So let's take a bout through the tunnel of life
Because you know what I'm thinking of,
See'mon baby just take it off

Take it off
Take it off
That's right, now take it off
Take it off
Pal Joey, take it off
See'mon now, take it off",Take It Off

When in Love (3X)

When in love you might cuss and fuss and fight
But at the end of the night, everything is alright
Drips of tears turn into drops of sweat
It'll only get as wet as I let it baby
I love hard, I've done some effed up things
from kicking them in the Nerfs, to throwin away his ring
So if you love me, love me and stay with me
But you can walk if your plan is to play me
I'm not embarrassed, nor am I ashamed
To say once in the past, I've been gamed
But that was then, and this is now
And there's no way damn it, there's no how
Although you gotta go through the good and the bad
Pray to the one up above it's not a fad
You'll do some crazy things when in love
Those in love know what I'm speakin of

When in Love

When in love you do things that are strange
Look back and say, ""I must have been deranged!""
I'm talkin like pickin your lover's nose
cooking his food and washing his clothes
And if you thought that was goin too far
What about givin him the keys to your car?
You could be partyin and havin a ball
but you stop and check your messages to see if he called
How about sittin in the house all night
waitin for the phone to ring -- that ain't right!
But you do it anyway cause you love him to death
And if he was dyin, you'd give your last breath
You gotta go through the good and the bad
Pray to the one up above it's not a fad
You'll do some crazy things when in love
Those in love know what I'm speakin of

When in Love (2X)

When in love you go out your way to please him
Wait outside his job, hope that you see him
And guys buy girls some serious things
like two-seater cars and diamond rings
I know what happens, she got you strung
Guess it doesn't matter long as you're having fun
Love'll make you do some crazy things
Meet a married man and then have a fling
Like Babyface said, ""Love makes things happen""
It's most important, to hear what I'm rappin
Someone in love better take your time
Cause love sometimes make one commit crimes
Although you gotta go through the good and the bad
Pray to the one up above it's not a fad
You'll do some crazy things when in love
Those in love know what I'm speakin of

Only needs his fingers with his food

Frontin' in his ride with his home boys braggin'
Lying 'bout the Lyte how he knocked boots last night
But he's a ruffneck so that's alright
Triple o baldie under the hood
Makin' noise with the boys up to no good
C-low on the down low cops come around so ruffneck front like he gotta go
Evil grin with a mouth full of gold teeth
Startin' beef is how he spells relief

I need a man that's quick and swift
To put out the spliff and get stiff
Boxer shorts everything is fitting large
Body ain't gotta be large to be in charge
Pumpin' in and out and out and in and here we go
He knows exactly how I want my flow and that's slow
Never questioning can he get buck wild
He's gotta smack it, lick it, swallow it up style
Drink a beer, sittin' his chair
Hands in his pants fiddlin' with his dick hairs
He's a rudeboy, a raggamuf
Ready to bag another brother that he ranks not ruff enough

Shed tears or switch
Doin' whatever it takes to make ends meet
But never meetin' the end cause he knows the street
Eat sleep shit fuck, eat sleep shit
Then it's back to the streets to make a buck quick
Quick to beg even though gimme gottem here
Hit'em wit a bit a skins then he's out of there
On the avenue girls are passin' thru
Too much of ruffneck so they ain't havin' you
Hard boppin' always grabbin' his jock and braggin' about his tec
Is the wannabe ruffneck
That's the kind you gotta watch out for
Just to get a rep he'll pull the plug on the tour
Pissin' in corners
Doing 80 by funeral mourners
Showing little respect
Now that's a ruffneck

I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

Would you stop scheming and trying to look hard
I'll get my bodyguard, You'll get that booty scarred,
I'm a veteran which means that I've been
In the game too long Since the days of Paper Thin
Way back when I've been putting it down
Ask your homies who's the baddest bitch on this side of town
I float like a butterfly sting like a bee,
Spectacular on the M I C,
I go for broke, Never giving it less than the best
Many years in the game at your request,
You like the rhyme bite if you dare,
I get the paper so I don't care,
Fly that's me the epitome
Of what a real MC is supposed to be,
Fucking you up every time that I drop,
Fuck a bullet baby, I done took your spot
I guide the best and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

Cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

Would you back off me and let my skin breathe,
Lyte is everlasting it's hard to believe
I shall prevail cause I'm next to none
Cause I'm claiming no set, don't plan to get down.
Just Brooklyn is where I'm from
But I'm resting in Studio City for the fun,
If you don't understand just say you don't(nah!)
And don't wait for me to explain cause I won't
You see it's in my nature to be the best,
West to East See East to West,
Ready or not I have arrived and I'm live
Showing an MC how to survive.
It's crazy how I get you captured with my tactics,
I got many witnesses who can back this
Ruffnecks from New York to LA
Been down with me since Poor Georgie.
It's '96, it's all about show and prove
And I'm about to make the ill type moves,
I guide the beat and ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

Cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

Would you get out my shit, please let me be,
I don't see why, you KGB
Why you gotta be all up on me like that,
Trying to get over like a fat rat,
But I understand, I'm a woman in the land of hip-hop
And the shit don't stop,
It goes on, on, on, on
You see the shit don't stop till the break of dawn
And now who makes it liver than a hip-hop, scuba diver,
Chillin with a pina colada,
Kidada hooked me up with Tommy now I got a lot of gear
From everywhere that I'd like to share (yeah right!)
But I'd rather do Kani, Don't ask why! 5001, my son gets shit
Done
All on the catwalk, what they've ever done for you
You betta get down with your real crew,
Cause I ride the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

Cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

To the L, to the Y, and the T, to the E
Rock a party and rock a party and rock a
Party int the B- girl stance.",Cold Rock a Party
MC Lyte,"Got a new gig, here you come again kid
Fresh out the dog, done did your bid
But you can't stay here no more
Not in this crib

Not with the foul way that you used to live
I remember you would take long trips on the first of the month
Not giving a fuck about what I want
Break, uh! Breathe Lyte! Breathe!

The day that you left I spent mad dough trying to get shit fixed
'Cause of your fucking death wish
Broken glass everywhere, 
'Cause a motherfucka' like you just didn't care
Got my shit shot up, 
Had to buy a new body for my Benz, 
'Cause of your wild ass friends

Years ago when you started on the scene, 
Back and forth smuggling shit from Caribbean
It was you and your boy Dunn, making them suicide runs
But it was all in fun till Dunn tried to run with half of your cut
Now your boss is looking at you saying ""What the fuck is up?""

What's up? But you say, ""Fuck him"" 
You could start your own ring and things
Besides you get a lot of peeps to swing
Now you got eight men working 7 days a week
2 be the runners, 5 on the street

1 be the side kick,, the right hand, 
You know the one that ride shotgun thinking he the man
They'd kill to be where you are, oh yeah! 
The drug lord superstar
You got a new crib, new truck, new car
Trying to fit in, 
Throwing parties for them big type rap stars

But on the other side of town, 
Shit is getting hot, 
Your man got shot
And they blew up your tree spot, 
On 125th and St. Nick, 
Shit is getting thick
Your boy got caught in St. Martin with a brick, 
Now he's exile
You down to 6 motherfuckas 
And three of them motherfuckas is nothing but suckas

I got feds at my door want to know do I know a black
Now I ain't never called ya no shit like that, I'm fed up
I can't take it no more, 
You see I'm blazing at the next nigga knocking at my door
I heard you're on the run now, 
D is in the penile

Ratted your ass out and gave that what, 
When and how
They'd all kill to be where you are, 
The druglord superstar
They found a boy in the sand, 
It was Poppi your man 
With his eyes dug out and you must
Be soft

Heard they shot up your car 
And ransacked your loft, now you need a get away
A place to hide, 
'cause your man done snitched on the inside
You was on the run like a slave aback in the days, 
You must have been nodding when
They said

""Crime don't pay""
I got a new gig, here you come again kid, 
Fresh out the dog
Done did your bid but you can't stay here no more, 
Not in this crib
Not with the foul way that you choose to live

Motherfucker, you know what
Just, just take your shit all right! Just take it!
Cause I'm sick of this shit, 
I can't take it no more
Just take it, 
I don't know who the fuck you think you are

Thinking you could just come back here 
And try to enter my life, like I need you
I don't
I'm through with you motherfucker
Just get out! 
You put me through too much heartache
Too much shit

drippin wit Vaseline
My Mabeline left a ring on the scene
I got mad peeps down with the tag team
Listen you couldn't front it you want to
Trying to escape now I'm the one that you're running to
Looking at my tag it's about that time
for you to get yours, for me to get mine
I got our shit poppin wheelies like a Ninja

Either roll with us, or get rushed in, in God we trust
Cause it's a must, that I kick it like I hear it
Speak it like I see it
It's the spirit, I ain't go to see it to believe it

So let the games begin.
Now I'm a give ya something,
So you could get in to it.
I got the side view so
I could watch it.
You've been on my mind,
But your're so hard to find.

That behind.
I ain't ashamed to play the game.
Listen here I won't say no names.
Put your ass out;
Make your woman put your ass out.

You would pass out 'cause
I gave you bo type of indication and
If I did I was probably on the same medication.

I want to feel your muscle flex off your backbone.
I got the jones and I can't leave you alone.
I want to rub your deltoid down to your bicep.

Well awake and I'm ready for the fun.

Believe that baby.
I want to sacrifice.
I'm on it, you couldn't shake me off
If you tried.
No sleeping on the job and
I'm wide-eyed.
I like the video you got out;
The song is butter.
Try to keep a clean head and my mind
Out the gutter.
But it's hard; you bring out the best and the worst.
If you way back when I
Would've let you hit it first.
Love, its like water on the brain,
Only you can tame this runaway train.
Last time I seen ya, gleam in your eye,
You was looking fly with your girl
By your side.
Shit, I ain't trying take her place,
I just want to have your face
All up in my space.

People get fooled, it ain't easy as it seems.
You can rock on till the break of dawn,
But one by one, your ass is gone.
I got trapped in the rap game at sixteen and saw
It's no more than a craps game, know what I mean?
Like when you feel you shake 'em right, they fake roll snake
Eyes in the this industry; that's how quick niggas die.
Through my eyes its like Russian roulette;
Never do you know when you about to get wet.
So you should stay set, so you don't fall and go under.
Have people saying: ""I wonder what happened to him or her.""
It's sad when you begin to think you can be gone, but you
Can be gone in the blink of an eye, don't ask why, 'cause you try
Somebody came along that was twice as fly.
I remember when I hit the scene, it was the second faze;
Rope chains, two finger rings, those where the days.
Latin quarters, why puma suit was cool.
Now let me be caught in that and I'll be damned a fool.  Ya
Gotta change with the times like the weather.
MC's that lasts is the MC's that's clover.
You can't move too slow 'cause when
It's to time to go, you see it's no time to go.

You can rock on till the break of dawn,
But one day, sister, your ass is gone.
Come back after come back; nigga came back more whack
Than the whackest wax on the rack.  What's up with
That New Jacks are coming through, taking no slack.
They hungry, and they looking for a spot to cop a squat.
You better watch the clock, it can be awfully embarrassing
To not know when it's time to let go of the rhyme.
It's about half past the monkeys ass.
You should have been gone but you
Still trying to hang on, what happens when you
Chilling at the level on the 10th floor, nobody
Knows your name anymore, aren't you?
Wait and let me think, just as quick as you
Got large, you can quickly shrink and sink into the crates and
Collect dust, don't be mad cause it happens to best of us.

You can rock on till the break of dawn,
But one by one, your ass is gone.
To and fro, they come and go, you better change your flow
And then switch up your show, I seen some come with the
Booming ass hits, then they gone, but then they don't leave
With shit, you better tell an exec you need to be set
So when it's over, you ain't living out your Land Rover.
When you rap life dies,
And you still alive nigga, you better know how to
Survive, it ain't easy and it ain't supposed to be.
Letting niggas know what time it is
When it comes to me the L-Y-T-E,
Stronger than the ox the octane that
Knocks in your brain I sustain.
My mission is to maintain sane, know what I mean?
Keep doing my thang, you can't move too slow
'Cause when it's your time to go, you gotta go, gotta go.

I can feel you getting closer.

I come in peace but I got shit that need to be released.
Now who from the chosen shall I choose? 
Yeah, now you wish you was in his shoes. 
I found me a new nigga this year. 
That know's how to handle this here. 
Now I look forward to goin' home at night. 
Brother does mo right. 
Under the candlelight. 
Wax upon my back, can I handle all of that? 
I guess I can. 
Can I, why not? 
If I want to guess I can. Can I? 
More honey than a bumble-bee hive.
Pulling 69 ways in my archive. 
Sweet like licorice. 
Sugar for my booga. 
Juicy like Hi-C. Or an Icee. 
I got shit to make your ass write a bad check. 
Cause like I said I ain't afraid of the sweat. 
Beat on my drum if you feel the need to.
As I proceed to  Open up and feed you. 
I got a longing to put you where you want to be. 
Been I can, I get rid of all company.

CHORUS

Many have tried strict regulation. 
Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation. 
Those that didn't perform well. 
They gets no answer when they ring-a-ring-a my bell. 
You're playing with my time. 
Trying to jerk me hurt me then dessert me. 
You better work me. 
While you got the oppurtunity. 
To be in the midst of the L-why-T-E. 
Only the strong survive. 
Only the wise excel. 
Once said by my born-in-hell.
Only the lonely die slowly. 
Left all alone try to control me. 
Easy does it never ask how was it.
Never speak my info why my sheets in the streets. 
Cause that ain't cool. And that ain't cute. 
To talk about who knocked the boots on a video shoot. 
But it's all good, though you gotta get it when you want it. 
Like your prey, make your move and hop up on it. 
It's natural. Never be ashamed. 
Fuck the fame. Get the name, and kick the game.",Keep on Keepin' On [T.V. Track with Ad Libs]

I'm bout it bout it, you know my ones stay crowded
Fuck around and doubt it, and get that ass louded
The future me, 2003, ultra magnetic, this MC... (MCs, MCs, MCs freeze)
I'm not afraid of you niggas, I'm ready for the masses
I keep it tight like spandex do asses
Palmer's cocoa butter for the ashes, while Chanel laces up my lashes
Uh oh no, stop! It don't get hot because I locked it
Got it, give me 6 million like you gave Tupac it
Hot forever 'coz that's how I plotted

verse 2 (G. Salah)
I'm that are rated nigga from the films with mistique
With taste from the hamptoms but still street
Don't sleep I reach the ghetto to elite
Blessed with the vocals gifted with the feet
Pretty nigga, pearly white teethe
I can't for now 'coz my mind says from Asia
I'm unreachable, fuck a portable and pager
Made nigga, no time for posin', leavin' niggas like Moses
Front and get swollen The black italian G. Salah the chosen

Belle Venezuela, rockin' Argentina
Hot like heaters, swift like cheeters
>From where I stand grass remains greener
(Let me tell you 'bout a girl, maybe I shouldn't
I met her in Brooklyn, and her shit is always cookin')
See I be flowin' yes constantly
That's why the cabbage that I stack is deep winter green
And the way that I be hittin', unlike any other sister, I get into your

Closer to your fears. Close to hear your laughter. 
Hold me when you're close to tears.

Every field and flower fades but love is infinite. 
There are no boundaries. There are no limits. 
My heart's a bigger place now that you're in it.

Here's a situation, skip the talk
Let me know dog if you bite or bark
What it is soldier, you ready to march
Can you make me shoot, or you just soft
Cause I got no time for the games
Just keep my spine full of pain
Hit the boost and hit turbo
In this sexual inferno
Keep my lovin', drippin' drains
Or love highway, switchin' lanes
Show me different thangs with the whip and chains
Hit you with this grippin' pain
Can you handle that, are you alright
Test me out, is it alright
Come on baby, you ain't finished
You servin' time, I ain't talkin' minutes

Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long

Certified misses, I'm misses
Only get my time if it's
Somethin' that stay somethin'
All night, until brunch and
Hit it right, manouvre me
Take your big knot, ? me
Pull my hair back, who the ruler be
Lovin' you so tight, no room for three
Tell me you want me
My love keep you horny
I know's my mother on me
Stay away from the masculine
Thing that keep me needing asperin
Got me gaspin' in for air, pashin' and
Sheets satin and mixed with silk
Here's my love, mixed with milk

Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long
Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long
What does it feel like

Check me out, feminine engine
Brooklyn girl, read the emblem
Him, them, and that's hangin'
Ten, it's nine-eight and then
Till it's hot and you got me bent
On top of my thing, you win
Came nine times, going for the tenth
Think you could hang if you attempt
With energy, when you enter me, hold on
Goin' for a ride, hope you don't fold on
Me, when we in the midst
Of battlin' with my slip
No babblin', close your lips
Get close to it, nothing close to this
Feelin' what I feel when I'm next to you
I stretch for you, please stretch me too
Night got me right as we take the flight
Through the clouds of love, highest heights
My thing's tighter than a Jew's pockets
Think you used to it, go head, rock it

Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long
Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long

Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long
Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong

But you look for good luck, swing in the Expo G
I mean no harm, but that lucky charm
You need to ditch it quick, get with the Brooklyn bomb
I be, we be, bumpin' the spot G
Wherever we be, we hit correctly
It's been so long, we gotta get it on
To this song, my song, now sing along come on

[Chorus]

[MC Lyte]

Come here, let's rap a taste a little
Floor's too high, not to jiggle in the middle of tender vittle
Cell phone, on roam, Syl Rhone, come home we double chrome
But I can't make a mistake, hmmm
Leave the dance floor now (uhn uhn, no no)
I'm on to somethin', he bubblin' the sugar baby
Shoulda, woulda, coulda, that ain't me baby
When I step into my Mizrahi  frame
I change the game, it'll never look the same
Obstruct it, abstract it, my tactic, fantastic
It's been so long, we gotta get it on
To this song, my song, now sing along come on
I can't make a mistake, I can't make a mistake

[Chorus]

[MC Lyte]

Yeah...here he come, lookin' like he 21
Knowing damn well, he too could get done
But he got a partner, and that ain't too hard to fix
Once I slide up in the mix
Juggin' it baby, from right to left
Jigged out, gotta pick ya out from what's left
It's no mystery, the way ya humpin' and bumpin'
I what you comin' home with me?
I'm-gon'-get-some-satisfaction
The way you comin' at me with the action
You betta know it, when ya dealing with the poet
Whatever ? you got, you betta show it
It's been so long, we gotta get it on
To this song, my song, now sing along come on
I can't make a mistake, I can't make a mistake

Boston big beans and candy cane's 
Exchange you look on a number two train 
Run catch kiss sunshine or rain 
Jackson 5 good times with Jefferson's 
Yeah Baby you know I liked it better when 
You lived closer but then you moved 
But that couldn't stop our groove 
My magic man my Brooklyn boy I wonder 
I rub your shoulders and impress that you was under 
Late night rides out to sunrise 
Catch a flick or two and went back to bedside 
You in the bubble goose me in the sheep skin 
Cold as hell back then it wasn't mattering 
Long as we're hand in hand your my man I'm your girl 
Ready to conquer the world

[Chorus]
This is for all the years you've been 
My companion as well as my best friend 
So tonight Baby I'm giving you what you want 
It's all yours 

Our love is like a Romeo and Juliet flick 
So surreal but yet picturous 
There were problems I can admit 
But we handled it and still the candles lit 
So glad that we didn't just jet 
Cause now we reap the benefits 
Who would have thought 
The cute little boy from down the street 
Would fall in love with me 
It's like a number one dream come true 
To have somebody you love love you 
And that's all that matters 
Is that we grow together make sure we never
You're the reason I live 
Because I want you to get all that I got to give 
Long as we're hand in hand your my man I'm your girl 
Ready to conquer the world 

[Chorus]
Our love is mystical like galaxies you can't touch 
Around the world and back again I love you that much 
Our love is destiny like Bonnie and Clyde 
We'll die bolded side by side 
Throughout the day I remain truthful 
I keep it tight for you sexy and useful 
I told my mom when our days are through 
If you have to go first bury me next to you 
What I feel is unexplainable, 'I love you' 
Just ain't enough to say to you 
You've been there from the beginning to the end 
My companion as well as my best friend 
You got my heart now, here's my life 
Yes I'm ready to be your wife 
From here one know that your the one

There's a party goin' on in my hotel room
And you're invited, all you got to do is show up x2

(Verse 1)
Now we done left the venue 'coz the show was done
Before we hit the hotel, make a quick run
To get the Martel to add to the fun, meet me at suite room 151
BYOB, we about to kick it off
Remember that party last year in the loft?
This'll be better 'coz we bigger now
Got mo' figures now, fit in mo' niggas now
I got about 30 of the finest
Ready to get flirty and down right do-dirty
We got twister the dots mean a lot
When you flip the dial end up with a face in your twot
Stop yappin' at the DJ, that ain't right
'Coz tonight this here DJ, he gon' save my life... (woah, woah)

[Chorus:]
(Verse 2)
Now the people are comin', and the party is jumpin'...
... and T is on the beat box
And after this song he'll rock the locks
Hotel security ain't troublin' us none
They partyin' with us, no badge and no gun
Grown folks in the livin' room showin' out
And they ain't leavin' till we kick 'em all out
Strip poker, truth or dare
I swear it's about to get sticky up in here
Back back and forth and forth
From New York to L.A and back to New York
Of course while I'm in town it's gotta be nice
On the North-East corner they're flippin' the dice
Now the bubbly's poppin' all over the suite
Swig on this and kick up your feet
Ain't no party like an MC Lyte party 'coz an MC Lyte party don't stop, pops
And this here's better than when the ball drops

[Chorus:]
(Verse 3)
Now here's the E-low, Jackie and Mark
Done hit the back room to jump start the sparks
It's gettin' all hot, now they pumpin' Beenie Man
Scream for the cream, but holler when you see me man
You know like I know, the party don't end till I say when
Now the grub is runnin' out better get it while you can
Pick is gettin' low better find you a man
Slow jam hit and you sittin' all alone
Ain't nobody gonna take you're borin' ass home
It wouldn't be fair for me to not tell you
I'm the hostess of the year, keep it in the clear
Yo, the party's over here, nope, the party's right here
Be careful not to wear and tear the derrier
Now ain't that supmthin', humpin' and a bumpin'
My motto is never let 'em see you comin'
A party like this can't be compared
That's why it only goes down once a year...

MC Lyte,"B-boy, where the fuck you at?
I been looking for you're ass since a quarter past.
Hot peas and butter, baby, come and get your supper
Before I make you suffer that's when you had enough-a

Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot? Surely I can, if you the man
I get loose and produce large amounts of juice
Can you get used to that or do you need
A boost of energy to enter me and get it on?

You're gettin' warm, I can feel you getting closer
Now baby, down this Mimosa
You better believe it's time to give a toast to
The woman of the decade, too bad to be played

Get vex and I'm bound to throw shade
All over your body, who's body? You're body
I can rock a party like nobody
Leavin' time to take home the loot

Choosy about who I let knock my boots
Now let me take sight while your lovin' the Lyte
Life ain't all that unless you're doing it right

Keep on, keepin' on
'Cause you came and you changed my world
Your love so brand new
Keep on, keep kickin' on
Doin' it right, right, right ah, ah, ah

Beware of the stare when I step into peace
I come in peace but I got shit that need to be released
Now who from the chosen shall I choose?
Yeah, now you wish you was in his shoes

I found me a new nigga this year
That knows how to handle this here
Now I look forward to goin' home at night
Brother does mo right, under the candlelight

Wax upon my back, can I handle all of that?
I guess I can, can I, why not?
If I wanna guess I can, can I?
More honey than a bumble-bee hive

Pulling 69 ways in my archive
Sweet like licorice, sugar for my booga.
Juicy like Hi-C. or an Ice
I got shit to make your ass write a bad check

'Cause like I said I ain't afraid of the sweat
Beat on my drum if you feel the need to
As I proceed to open up and feed you
I got a longing to put you where you wanna be
Been I can, I get rid of all company

Keep on, keepin' on
'Cause you came and you changed my world
Your love so brand new
Keep on, keep kickin' on
Doin' it right, right, right ah, ah, ah

Many have tried strict regulation
Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation
Those that didn't perform well
They gets no answer when they ring-a-ring-a my bell

You're playing with my time
Trying to jerk me hurt me then dessert me
You better work me, while you got the opportunity
To be in the midst of the L Y T E

Only the strong survive, only the wise excel
Once said by my born-in-hell, only the lonely die slowly
Left all alone try to control me
Easy does it never ask how was it

Never speak my info why my sheets in the streets
'Cause that ain't cool and that ain't cute
To talk about who knocked the boots on a video shoot
But it's all good, though you gotta get it when you want it

Like your prey, make your move and hop up on it
It's natural, never be ashamed
Fuck the fame
Get the name, and kick the game

You see they speak on a passin', Lyte was a lesson
I'm still shakin' these hoes down, without a weapon

Sure as you get high, we'll never see eye-to-eye

If I'm on my psycho, act like you might know
Which way the light go, but you never will

Nigga know the mechanicals
Break the pistol down, you should see them handles
The street taught the child, no read up manuals
Push your crack vows, young Nino Brown
Chasin green is the dream, when your young and brown
Bound to be a problem child, look what I'm involved in now
A 'Dozen Dirty' niggaz and they all get down
Dissolve any problem that enlarge with ours
When revolvers we said ""all men get down"" ([gunshot], c'mon)

[Kuniva]
While your punchin and tacklin punks
I'm handlin chumps, packin a pump
That's longer than the elephant trunk [gun cocks]
On the streets I'm a beast, I feast upon the weak
So speak beef, I'll shot you and scream ""increase the peace""
A monster, pistol packin pushin niggaz off they Hondas
Starve ya, get it crackin, yankin bitches for they ganja
Sneaky as fuck, I don't think mama beat me enough
When she was sleepin stuff, I was stealin the keys to the truck
Shut the fuck up, before you end up dead in the dump truck
Or in the streets takin a nap, bleedin and Lugged up
+Who Want What+ like M. Bleek, with this heat if you ten deep
Then fuck it, it will be ten sleepin [gunshots]

[Proof]
Know much about my a land ski
Don't tustle with my hand speed
Clutch your burner, bust it and watch your man bleed
We ferocious, toast no holsters
Approach us, throw heat straight from the soldiers (c'mon, [gunshot])
We the soldiers, ya'll the youngsters (ha)
Youngsters lungs puncture, dead in a dumpster [gunshot]
Upstairs the Munsters, hand full of drama
You scared of the drama, bomber the monster [gun cocks, boof]
I'm back nigga (woof), I reappear
Shoot like [gunshot], homie steer clear
Blackness, carcass covered with cat fish
We murkers with no purpose other than practice

[Bizarre]
There's three things I hate: liars, fakes and cheaters
Alcoholics, sluts and fuckin wife beaters
A gat that describes my life
I don't even know who song this is [Obie Trice]
Bitch, Bizarre don't give a fuck about no hip hop
At my release party in a pink tank top in Reeboks [laughing]
This Ja Rule beef I ain't gettin in
I'll meet an are & be	 singer to sing at my wedding
I turn your face into a fuckin meat patty
I'll fuck your mommy and go fishin with your granny

Rich like Nestle, thick like Wesley
Snipe out, I'm the type that be about
Crashin' up in ya joint and knockin' the lights out
Feelin' lovely, trust me, I'm drug free
Only chewed on bringing out the thug in me
'cause you sittin' on my nerves, when we've already heard
That garbage, played-out crap you call rap
Some chicks say they love that, well I'm above that
Calling me a ? ? ? it's two, double O two
And my crew roll thick like BIG
Act up, and be puttin' that ass to sleep
You got nothing for me, been there, smelt the dope and
Rollin' with the shelter, making niggas jail free
Like a Luger, I spit thick shit
That a leave ya squad sick, 'cause I ran up in this shit

Holla, get crunk, get live with me
Brotha, don't make you as fly as me
Gotta get yo' ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me, come on ride with me
Holla, get crunk, get live with me
Brother, don't make you as fly as me
Gotta get yo' ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me, come on ride with me

Still got the little frame with the big name
Watch it change 'cause, nah nigga, we ain't in the same gang
We walk different and we talk a different slang
You a sidekick, and I'm a four point six range
You a one roof flat, I'm fifty acres of land
In Jamaica with your man laid up, gettin' a tan
Thought you knew, I'm overdue
And you're overrated so cats are over you
I inspired you, come on now, no way
? that rumour, the consumer won't believe it anyway
Never play with the messenger, Head on Joan of Arc
When I'm coming through these parts like just cut the dark
I'm a trendsetter, go getter, bringer back
'cause I'm fed up, ready to get a set up
Oh you scurred, vision blurred
'cause I serve these words
And pitch them bitches with a curse

Holla, get crunk, get live with me
Brotha, don't make you as fly as me
Gotta get yo' ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me, come on ride with me
Holla, get crunk, get live with me
Brother, don't make you as fly as me
Gotta get yo' ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me, come on ride with me

Yo what I'm sayin I've been layin' waitin' for the right situation
New York hawk city playin', back in the BK bomber
Niggas in the hood call me Lyte
But brothers call me Lana Moorer the high scorer
Play fool if you want to, we closin' after quarter
I started it and I shut the shit down
Sit down, don't nobody move, I'm making haters quit now
Been a long time coming but I'm running with the torch
Race, got a lot a rats but I can't be caught, or bought
'cause I won't sell out, that's why me and the big dogs, we fell out
Not with a major, but I'm still major league
Crash ya dome with this ? then watch your nose bleed
You want it, you can get it anytime
'cause I got many lines for niggas of any kind, you know me

Holla, get crunk, get live with me
Brotha, don't make you as fly as me
Gotta get yo' ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me, come on ride with me

MC Lyte,"Oh hey hey well well well
Do you mind if I tell the truth for a second y'all

Maybe I deserve
To wonder who calling so damn late
For you to say I'm trippin' it's just a homie from upstate (said it's just a homie)
Don't he know it's 1:00 in the morning
You say it's cool baby it's cool

Baby I deserve
For you to say he's coming into town ( he wants to see you)
And he's just wondering if you and him can hang out
I don't like it but I know I gotta trust you
It ain't cool cause I know it's true

Maybe I deserve
For you to go out and find some other guy
Maybe I deserve
For you to stay out with him all night
Maybe I deserve
For you to do all the things I did to you
Maybe I deserve ( oh yeah)
Maybe I deserve
Repeat Twice

For you to put on a sexy dress
For me to ask you Who the hell you trying to impress
For you to laugh it off like it ain't nothing
I know it's something Maybe just maybe

To sit a home and wonder where you are
Is he kissing you touching you holding you what
Take a drink and help ease my mind
I want to be mad after all those times

Repeat chorus 2X

For me to ask you where you been
For you to say I better stop tripping
To grab your neck until you let me know
For you to run crying, crying out the door
To grab my coat and chase you down the street
To say it ain't you it's my own insecurity
For you to say yes I cheated on you
I won't care cause after all I put you through I deserve
I desrve yeah yeah yeah
To be mistreated sometimes
To even be lied to sometimes
Maybe you should go cheat on me

Maybe I should sit and wait by the phone
Cause I paged you about 3 or 4 times
Girl I know girl I know I then put you through
I then put you through hell
And I don't care
And I don't care
And I deserve

See a man can't take another man taking our woman
We can't even stand waiting by the phone
But we do the same shit",Maybe I Deserve

Girl where do you come from
I've been looking for you all of my life
Even though I barely know you boy
I think maybe tonight's the night
Cause I've been looking for your love all of my life

It's two o'clock in the morning and I'm still wide awake
Writing letters to you girl but I throw them all away
Because I, I wanna show you what I feel for you
But these words and this paper just ain't good enough for you
How can I prove to you that girl you live inside my mind
And I could see your pretty face every time I close my eyes
Something about the way we met the day we met I cant forget
I play this song again and again and I
I tell myself that one day you gonna be my special queen
Convince myself that you feel the same way for me
And even though we just met it feels so right
It's going down tonight

Tell me can I talk to you
Girl where do you come from
I've been looking for you all of my life
Even though I barely know you boy
I think maybe tonight's the night
Cause I've been looking for your love all of my life

Girl I can tell the way you feelin' your smile is so revealing
That sparkle in your eyes got knowing that you're willing to take a ride with somebody like me
Lets take a chance girl and you can be my royalty
My loyalty from this night until the very end
Is like a game that we play but everybody wins
Si tu fueras mi reina yo te regalaria
Todos mis dias momentos llenos de allegria
You got me fienin for the taste of just one kiss
Im fantasizing what is like and I just cant stop this
I think I'm going crazy so tell me can we talk pretty lady

Tell me can I talk to you
Girl where do you come from
I've been looking for you all of my life
Even though I barely know you boy
I think maybe tonight's the night
Cause I've been looking for your love all of my life

The type of mamasita that is down for mine
And if you feel the same way let me know girl
Let me know mama

The type of mamasita that is down for mine
And if you fell the same way let me know girl

MC Magic,"Why would you lie to me?
After all that we've been through
After the love I gave you
I just need you to trust me

How could I trust you?
How do I move on?
When all you do is tell your lies
Your killin' me inside
Why would I take you back?
So many sleepless nights
We had a good thing, but you threw it all away

They said you don't know what you got until it's all gone
I wish I never had to sit down and write this song
But, baby girl, if I could turn back the hands of time
If I could press rewind, live it one more time
I wouldn't do the things I did
I take back what I said
I never break a promise
If you take me back again
Everyone deserves a second chance, and this is it
So reach inside your heart and be compassionate, girl
Did you forget the way we use to love each other
The way you told me that you could never love another?
Damn, it's like I'm beggin' you to stay alive
I love you, girl, and I need you by my side

You could tell your lies
I don't really care what you feel inside
All you ever did was make me cry
Maybe one day you'll realize
That you had a good girl in your life

I don't really care what you feel inside
All you ever did was make me cry
Maybe one day you'll realize
That you had a good girl in your life

I know you really don't mean the things
You said right now
Baby, (c'mon, girl)
See, all I need is one more chance
To show you that I never gonna do you wrong again
Please, girl, c'mon

I still remember promises of making it together
Forgive and forget
We can still be forever
The key to my happiness
My life is in your hands
I'll do whatever just to kiss your lips again
Come close to me, girl
So you can feel what I'm sayin'
I'm serious, and I can't take it
No more playin'
Today is the first day of the rest of my life
I wanna spend every moment with you
Makin' it right, and
I know that maybe this can take a long time, and
I know that it's always in the back of your mind, but
I know that you deserve the stars in the sky
So if you give me one last chance
I'll never make your cry
You could tell your lies
I don't really care what you feel inside
All you ever did was make me cry
Maybe one day you'll realize
That you had a good girl in your life",Lies
MC Magic,"It's the passion inside
And your dreams come alive
It's the burning inside
I'm going to reach 4 the sky
It's the passion inside
I'm going to reach 4 the sky

Just get your mind right
Get your sprit up and then we can do it
Keep your mind on the prize
And keep prosing
Average people make the world go round
And average instruments make extraordinary sounds
If you got talent baby let it shine
Give it to the world
And let them see what's inside
You're like a treasure and you have the key
Every minute of the day is what it takes to be
The best of the best
So give it all you got
And maybe one day you'll be standing on the top
But open up your eyes and realize
No matter what you do you got to give it some time
I want to see you dance
I want to see you smile
I want to see you laugh every day of your life
I want to know that passion deep inside
You tried every day even if it makes you cry

It's the passion inside
And your dreams come alive
It's the burning inside
I'm going to reach for the sky
It's the passion inside
And your dreams come alive
It's the burning inside
I'm going to reach for the sky

Reach for the sky but I got to stay grounded
As long as I'm breathing my heart is still pounding
I see the vision when I close my eyes
And if I stop right now than I might as well die
Let the strength and the power you posses
Take you to the limit and beyond to express
A strong mind gets high on success
A week mind gets high on bull shit
And so I keep on rhyming
Let my music and my flow get you all so excited
Make you want to change the world today
If you still got the passion inside it's never too late
You got to move
Got to show
Got to rise
You got to let the world see through your eyes
Don't let no one tell you a lie
Today is your day and it's time to shine

Don't let nobody tell you that it's impossible
Just follow your heart and your dreams
Just follow your heart and your dreams
Your dreams
Hold up

Why no quiero sufrir.
Necesito tu amor.
Yo me muero sin ti.

I told you when I met you, that I had someone in my life.
""I won't tell if you won't tell"" is what you said that night.
Do you remember it started as a game.
But when you play with fire, sometimes you can't put out the flames.
You said that you's a big gurl: undertood the circumstances.
Never took for granted- sneak away romances.
Tonight's the last night, I can't go on like this.
Got you crying on muh sleeve, trying to beg me not to leave.
Por favor no llores.
Gurl I gotta go. Estoy perdiendo, tu llanto rompe el corazon.
And if I stay 5 minutes I just might give in.
It's a battle I can't win.
More than just a sin. Made a promise to myself plus someone else.
From this day 'till the end I gotta be somebody else.
Forgive me mama if I'm making you cry.
I never meant to change your life but I gotta say good-Bye.

So many times you make mistakes, lying to the ones we love.
I should've seen this coming, but I choose to be the selfish one.
Muh mind is thinking I'll just see her one more time.
No more sneaking away to the hotel, telling these lies.
But every time we see eachother, I can't let go.
Still muh thoughts are saying you got a good gurl at home.
A good mama to the kids after she works all day.
Does she deserve to be mistreated and lied to this way? No.
But on the other hand I got you on the phone.
Telling me you can't wait to have me in your arms.
DAMN. I'm going crazy, loosing muh mind.
I shouldn't see you on the side, but it feels so right.
Maybe after tonight we can say Good-Bye.
And I'm thinking to myself this has got to be the last time.
Ya no llores baby gurl, don't cry.
You deserve somebody better, that's gonna love you right.

When I got you sitting by side 
When I feel that sexy body 
Rubbing up all over mine. 
That is when I know 
I got a tendoreli 
More then a homie 
When the lights go down 
You are all up on me damn,
Now I gotta show you mamma 
Toching places you wanna 
So hot like Arizona 
In wada California 
Cause you are ma tendoreni 
That I been tryin'to find 
Tell me your fantasies 
And all your secrets on you're mind 
Lets roll on a hotel suit 
Laundry and your pretty feet 
Look so good that I wanna eat 
I think you're twisting me 
And I know you love this place 
So goo like birthday cake 
Lets put it down like Bobby Brown 
And ma man Baby Face

Use to a time 
When I skipped the game 
Always got a girl fora different date 
Its funny how life takes a sudden change 
Cause then I all pimp up on ma brain 
Got one girl that makes me hold all of the other girls are at the front door 
Was one to be grown 
But I will sit back and drop slow 
Got a lot of money you know that 
So let me keep you like a polar cat 
Get a Gucci bag to match 
And then get the shows to go with that 
I love it when you walk down representing

Making plans to never let you go
And if we make a promise,
Girl I never lie
Be together till we 95
Maybe you never had a man that understands, the things to make you happy---girl
But I can be the one to change it all cause see to me you just so beautiful
So when you ready for somebody
Who can really
Love you right
Give me a call, and I can be the one to love you girl until the morning light.

La ra ra ra ra ra

This is how we do it
It's Friday night, and I feel alright
The party is here on the West side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver take the keys to my truck
Hit the shore 'cause I'm faded
Honeys in the street say, ""Monty, yo we made it!""
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by
You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

Let's flip the track, bring the old school back
(This is how we do it)

This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a want to-be player
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case G
But now I'm a big G. The girls see I got the money
A hundred-dollar bills y'all

If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64

He came up to Monty, this is what he said

Sell a million records and we'll make in a dash

MC Mario,"If I, I get to know your name
Well if I, could trace your private number, baby

All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your lovin' arms
I want some, want some

I set my sights on you
(And no one else will do)
And I, I've got to have my way now, baby

All I know is that to me
You look like you're having fun
Open up your lovin' arms
Watch out here I come

[Chorus]
You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round round round
You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round round round

I got to be your friend now, baby
And I would like to move in just a little bit closer

All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your lovin' arms
Watch out, here I come

[Chorus]

I need your love
I want your love

MC Master,"I remember what you said that day
Said, be careful what you wish for baby
'Cause it's a crazy world outside
But you've always got a place to hide

Well you've shown me things that I'd never seen
Gave me something that I could believe
All the love you give, it's a healing thing
And I thank you
For the common ground that you shared with me
For the higher ground, the way you lifted me
Now I come to you and you comfort me
And I thank you
I thank you

I, I, I thank you 
I, I, I, I thank you

There are chances that I had to take
And mistakes that I just had to make
California dreams don't all come true
But I could always count on you

Well you've shown me things that I'd never seen
Gave me something that I could believe
All the love you give, it's a healing thing
And I thank you
I thank you baby
For the common ground that you shared with me
For the higher ground, the way you lifted me
Now I come to you and you comfort me
And I thank you
I thank you baby

I, I, I thank you 
I, I, I, I thank you
I, I, I thank you
I thank you
I, I, I, I thank you

I remember what you said that day
You always know just what to say
I was blind but now I see
Thank you for forgiving me
Oh yeah

Well you've shown me things that I'd never seen
Gave me something that I could believe
All the love you give, it's a healing thing
And I thank you
I thank you baby
For the common ground that you shared with me
For the higher ground, the way you lifted me
Now I come to you and you comfort me
And I thank you
I thank you baby

I, I, I thank you

I, I, I thank you
I, I, I, I thank you",Thank You

MC Nego do Borel,"Cheguei no pistão
Deixa eu falar, deixa eu falar, deixa eu falar
Cheguei no pistão, e vi um bonde lindo
As meninas dançando, e os amigos curtindo
Dançando e zuando, a rapaziada bebe
Quando solta o tambor, as meninas se perdem
Tava uma maravilha, escuta o que eu tô te dizendo
Ela faz o quadradinho, e o baile fica vendo
O bonde reunido, os cara não anda só
Traz logo o meu copo pra noite ficar melhor
Olha o segurança, que caô vai ter caô
Não vale vacilar, porque a noite começou
Hoje eu vou curtir, e falo na moral
Hoje a noite é do chefe, noite especial
Pra quem não tá ligado, olha o que eu vou falando
Tipo pop-star, artista americano",Cheguei no Pistão
MC Nego do Borel,"Ela me chamou na casa dela
Deixou a janela aberta tudo certo pra eu entrar
Sua mãe saiu foi no mercado
Pra comprar um frango assado e a gente no sofá
A doida me arrasta pro chuveiro
Love no banheiro pra deixar molhar
Pego o sabonete ô calor, tem barulho lá na sala
(Ihh, ai meu pai chegou!)

Relaxa 'tá tudo tranquilo
Relaxa não vai ter caô
Diz que eu sou profissional, que eu sou teu encanador

Relaxa 'tá tudo tranquilo

MC Nego do Borel,"Preciso conversar com Deus
Não sei o que aconteceu
Fiz essa canção pra te falar
Então vê se para pra pensar

Qual o motivo pra dizer adeus
Se toda vez que vai embora
Eu sei, que quer voltar

Quando bate a saudade
Um aperto no peito
Lembro da sua imagem
E de todo seu jeito
O seu sorriso lindo
Único e atraente
A pele é a cor da noite
Olha tão reluzente

Whisky, mulheres, balsas e mercenários
Tudo isso é vazio
Você é necessária
Quando o dia amanhece
E eu to com você
Pergunto a Deus o que eu fiz de tão bom pra merecer

Preciso conversar com Deus
Não sei o que aconteceu
Fiz essa canção pra te falar
Então vê se para pra pensar

Qual o motivo pra dizer adeus
Se toda vez que vai embora
Eu sei, que quer voltar

Segundo, minutos e horas vão passando
E essa vontade você vai cada dia aumentando
Com um simples toque
Me aflige, me domina
Pra que a liberdade
Você que é a minha sina

Tudo isso é vazio

MC Nego do Borel,"Amor
Eu gosto tanto de sentir o teu sabor
E ver TV contigo no meu cobertor
É bom demais amor sentir o teu carinho
Mas não me deixe sozinho
Que eu sou vida louca
Quando eu perco o controle
Eu parto pra cima e beijo na boca

As meninas dançando é o mundo se acabando
Eu libero a tequila, whiskey
E a novinha já vem rebolando
Volto pra ousadia
Eu me jogo no mundo
Até de madrugada vai ter cachorrada
É amor vagabundo

A festa na suíte, alivia o estresse
Eu sei que a mulherada
É a kriptonita que me enfraquece

Ficar sozinho dá caô

Na hora em que me olhou eu também olhei
Foi mais de duas horas que eu também fiquei
Te admirando

O som 'tava ali
O groove 'tava alto pra gente curtir
As minas cochicharam, que eu percebi
Eu percebi que 'tava me querendo

Só questão de tempo
Só questão de chance
Pra isso acontecer
Virar logo um romance
Seu beijo me conquistou
Penso nele a cada instante
Sorriso contagioso
Alegria viciante

Parece coisa de novela
Um olha pro outro
E, quando vê, já era
Sentado na minha cama
O pensamento vai nela
Que coisa estranha, loucura pampa

Você passava na minha rua
Eu nem te dava bola
Toda simplesinha, quieta indo pra escola
Cabelo arrumado, sapato fechado
Mas eu sempre soube
Que você tinha um rebolado

Pretinha, vou te confessar

E sai pra night toda elegante pra curtir um baile charme
A mina 100% e zero de sucessagem
Quando passa sorridente, é a mais linda da cidade
Olhou pra mim, que eu vi
Falou baixinho pra eu não escutar
E fez suspense pra eu imaginar a gente se pegando

Gostoso, aqui 'tá bom
Essa é da boa, curte a sensação
Que vem da alma, vem do coração
Visão de mano

Vem cá menina, entra na minha vibe
A casa é tua, tira a sua roupa, fica nua
Que eu te levo pro céu

Eu sou educado
Em algumas horas eu fico safado
Suas amigas comentaram, eu esculacho
Pode vir me amar, meu bem
Eu também garanto que de quieta você não tem nada
Eu adoro o seu estilo abusada
É cheia de encanto

MC Ren,"Now this is the bitch who makes straight A's,
But never got to leave out of the house back in de dayz
And when she was at school she gave people dirty looks,
She always carried books and thought me and my friends were crooks,
You always see the bitch in the classes,
She never wore pants she wore a dress and some glasses,
Teachers used to rag, she was the teacher's pet,
Every nigguz used to brag how much they want to make her wet,
Straight to her butt 'cause yo she ain't tall,
But you would say fuck her when you saw the bitch walk,
Ass hanging out by the pawn,
And that's another reason why niggaz wanted to get her panties down,
She kept to herself in the hallways,
And never looked at niggaz like old day,
And when the last bell rang she was gone,
So one day I decided to follow the bitch home,
Her mother was at work she would'nt get home 'till 6,
So it was time for ren to put the bitch in the mix, 
'Cause back in the school it was every nigguz dream,
So now it's time to get a closer look behind the scene!

""All the pimps, the hores, the pulldaggers, the cocksuckers,
 Gave 100$ bill just to see""

Now I made it to her house but she would'nt let me in yo,
So I said fuck it, smack around to the window,
She get into the room and start to undress,
Now I'm biting on my lips saying ""damn this bitch is blessed!""
The doorbell rang, it was the nextdoor neighbor,
And he was axing up could she do him a favour,
She grabbed de nigga's hand and took him in the room,
And laid on the back as he fucked her with a broom, 
She said she wanted back up so then she said,
She wanted him to eat the pussy so she grabbed his head,
And he started eating it like a thanks-given dinner,
He made the bitch come and then he put his dick up in her,
She smashed up his back with the cloth,
But she was screaming so loud he had to gaggle with his toes,
But after they finish fucking yo the bitch took a shower,
To wash off the sweat from the last half hour,
The bitch put out some bud and then she started to smoke,
Took his wicked jack daddy and made a few miles of cock,
The nigga said shit gotta go,
Bcuz this innocent little girl is a whore!
Yo BEHIND THE SCENES!

""Nobody in .. My neighborhood"" MiX

Now I went back to school the very next day,
And I knew that my niggaz won't believe what I had to say,
I told them what I saw and nigguz said ""yeah right"",
So I told the mothafuckaz to come over there tonight,
Now there's 10 real niggaz at her window,
Waiting to see a whore like alamat natio(?)
They thought that I was lying 'cause we waited 1 hour,
And when we started to leave the bitch walked out da shower,
Ass on the round the bitch do it in her bed,
Her bottomlips was hanging and she started fingerbanging,
Her daddy walked in and started beating her with a belt,
The bitch was so hot she made the leather start to melt,
But she was liking it,
Yelling ""daddy give it to me harder"",
Then he took off all his cloth and start fucking his doughter,
My niggaz outside did'nt believe what they would see-some,
But when her mama got home, they turned into a threesome,
Her mama ate the pussy while her daddy doggy sounded,
The family freak together and they also laid together,
I could'nt take them all 'cause I was too much of a man,
So I jumped back to the window with my dick in my hand,
The hand in the money kept to her neighbors' door,
'Cause now it was even it was 2 against 2,
But a couple minutes after I was in,
All my niggaz jumped in all 10 yo behind the scenes!

""This is the bitches and the ho's crew""

""Yes daddy I love you""

""She like suckin' on dicks .. And lickin' on nutts .. And they even take
 The broomstick on her butt!""",Behind the Scenes
MC Ren,"Hey, hey Ren, hey check this out loc
Hey man I've been hearing a gang of niggas 
Talking a whole lot of unnecessary bullshit man, 
What if one of 'em trick ass niggas 
Come at you the wrong way loc'?

[MC Ren]
I'll beat a niggas ass on the trick just for the hell of it
There the motherfucking piece of pussy there's no tell of it
I don't give a damn I'll beat a nigga like he's stole somethin'
And then I'll let the motherfucker know where Ren is coming from
I'm from Compton everybody's on the wagon
I'm looking for niggas that's thinkin' 
That they're the shit, that's who I'm taggin'
Never asking questions I just go right in and do it
And if you're thinking that you can fuck with Ren
You bitch already blew it
Like I said before, fools want up in my shoes
But after fucking with me
They're givin' up rap, and they're singin' the blues
Me and DJ Train dropping bombs like a P2
So you should get the picture or if not, you get a preview
That we don't take no shit
Cause MC Ren ain't a nigga that you want to try and fuck with
Kick a little ass in my spare time
To keep myself occupied when I'm not bustin' up a rhyme
Writin that shit that ya love to hear
Cause MC Ren is the final frontier

[Chorus]

(Black guy) Who is it?
(White guy) The black nigga that they call Ren
(Black guy) Who is it?
(White guy) The black nigga that they call Ren
(Black guy) Who is it?
(White guy) The black nigga that they call Ren
(MC Ren) Ya fuck with me ya gotta fuck with a Mack 10

[MC Ren]
Now throw your hands in the air and let me see ya slap a hoe
Start the violence going on through an MC Ren show
I don't give a fuck if niggas is fighting in the crowd
I only got one concern, that's my vocals pumping loud
I'm standing on the stage I got my niggas to my right
I bust a couple of verses 
Then jump in the crowd and get with the fight
I hit a nigga off in the head with a chair
The reason for that, the motherfucker he was standing there
Then DJ Train will grab the gauge, just in case a motherfucker 
Talks shit, he'll be the victim on the front page
He's on his way to the morgue, to kick it with the rest 
Of them motherfuckers that I gave free room and board
So when ya at my show
Let me see ya throw your hands up in the air and slap a hoe
Cause that's the only noise I want to hear
Cause MC Ren is the final frontier

[Chorus: x2]

[MC Ren]
The final frontier makes an average nigga wonder
Why they do a couple of records and then they go up under
Try to copy Ren but Ren just can't be duplicated
Motherfuckers making pussy shit so I come in and fade it
Slap the niggas like bitches if they have to talk back
Put my foot so deep in their ass they have a hole and not a crack
The shit just makes a nigga laugh, cause niggas be coming up to me 
Asking me why did I leave size 10 Nike in that ass
I tell 'em I had to do it was part of the plan
To try to stop the fools jacking off by the hand
Putting wack records in the make
By using R&B fucking singers in the god damn breaks
Try to go commercial but they started out street
That's reason why they're still driving their two feet
Thinking they can diss Ren's flow, but singing and dancing
Don't go with the format that I be using in my show
It's just hardcore niggas acting crazy on the stage
Wearing gangsta clothes yo and spitting on the hoes
Doin' that shit that ya love to hear
Cause MC Ren is the final frontier

[Chorus: x2]",Final Frontier
MC Ren,"The year is 87'
Back in the 12th grade G
When I used to hang with CH to the IP hangin' in the halls
Tryin' to get the young bitches ridin' my ballz
We got dissed 'cause we were jog' and kept to ourself shyo
Because it's all about self
We used to try to get the number and the name
But back then - they wanted mothafuckaz in the dope game
We used to try to fuck with ho's
In our graduatin' class there was no woman givin' up the ass
We go to a dance, we see ho's rollin' eyes on my crew,
But what the fuck can I do?
They would'nt even give a nigga like me a chance thou [why?]
Because my feet was my transport
You ax 'em to dance they start to riff
And on the way home niggaz never gave us a lift
But now the tables turned around
Every mothafucka and his mom would want to be down
I see the bitches at the clubs, the same ones
They're thinkin' they're fine and also runnin' the same line :
""What's up Ren, we used to be in the same class""
I'm shakin' my head yeah, now listen to line ass
They ax me what have I been up to,
Knowin' damn well I made money for my record sales
I zip on my drink and say see ya
'cause only a four leg and pregnant mud can be ya'

People that used to hate me
Now when they see me they speak first
But used to demon raps 'cause I cursed
They used to say I would'nt make it 'cause I use profanity
And call myself a Nigga With an Attitude
But once again the tables turned around
Niggaz tryin' to be down - walkin' up like a hound
Especially the ones that never had nothin' to say
Now they talk to me like enow and everyday
Axin' me what's up with Eazy
Or Dr. Dre, yo did he marry Miss She'ly?
Or did the D.O.C get his voice back,
And niggaz think I'm mean when I say I'm not a magazine
'cause when I come around I want to kick it
The ..... is axin' me for concert tickets
The same fools, that used to go to my school
When you see my on the streets just chill and be cool
So if you really want to be down -
Don't crowd around a nigga like a hound!

The hound-dogs, they come in all shapes n' sizes
Jackin' 'round Ren with a gang o' surprises
Nothin' but a groopy in sheep's clothin'
The shit makes me lough when the homies want an autograph
I feel like I'm on a talkshow
Because they ax all the questions then say they gotta go
Never want to know how I'm makin' out
All they want to know is when my alboum's commin' out
Or ax me - 'Yo Ren, when are you goin' on tour?'
I tell 'em 'the same time like I told you before'
Then there's always one beggin' for me to kick hm down
For pissin' on my leg I never knew you you fuckin' hound!
So go back to your home and fetch yo' bone
And quit retrievin' on mine 'cause nigga you got your own
And talk about me behind my back - nigga please!
So much of a hound, all you're missin' is your flees
Scratchin' all day because you're itchin'
You're tryin' to get news wishin' you was in my shoes
But trippin' like that you'd never be down
'cause Ren don't likes a fuckin' hound - 
You straight hound-dog!",Hounddogz
MC Ren,"You kiss my black ass because you sucked my dick off
My balls are fallin out of your mouth when you cough
This is for the people in the business, the people in the streets
And most of all it's to the wack muthafuckas with wack beats
Fools on the streets wish they was in my shoes
Cause every day they wake up, they see me on the news
I'm hittin number one the first week that I'm released
And my muthafuckin business and my bank account increase
Bitches ride the poke and niggas ride the sack
So I guess that you can say they're both caught in the impact
Niggas in my neighborhood ain't about nothin
The po' broke muthafuckas think I owe em something
But I don't owe em shit but a 'what's up' for a hello
And ask for a job, the answer is, ""Hell no""
Go back to the corner with your brew and be angry
Cause lookin at me crazy, that shit ain't gonna change me
But some of them are cool, and they know who they are
The ones that used to kick it with me when I couldn't afford a car
But the others talk shit behind my back
The main muthafuckas always sayin they gotta rap
Wait to make a record like it happens overnight
But the rhymes are always sloppy and they're never ever tight
Then they get pissed when I tell them that it's wack
But Ren ain't a pussy, so step the fuck back
And kiss my black ass

I'm tired of rappers with live instruments on the stage
Save the shit for parades
And while you're at it, why don't you dress like a clown
And draw yourself a permanent frown
Cause the pioneers didn't draw bands in the blueprints
Because it wouldn't make sense
Rappers doin this should retire
Niggas lookin like Earth, Wind & Fire
People don't go to rap shows, so they can hear a band
It's like a man tryin to fuck a man
It defeats the whole purpose
It's like a fish tryin to swim on the surface
A big circus, all that's missin is a tent
Because the shit ain't worth five cents
So a nigga like Ren'll take a stand
To say a real rap artist don't need a band
All you need on the stage is meat and bones
Save the band shit for Quincy Jones
And no more singin on the breaks, please
The shit is spreadin fast like disease
And for them I'll be a cure, pure
You know that I know I'm sure 
So I'ma trap on my lure
Every hypocritical muthafucka that's suckin with the rap
Give him a real nigga slap
Kiss my black ass

Now rappers in the business talk shit behind my back
Just because their shit ain't sellin and people call it wack
But when I go to clubs, I get the utmost respect
Them jealous muthafuckas know I clock crazy checks
Sayin I wouldn't sell if I didn't cuss
But while they fuss, I'm goin, gone, they goin dust
Barely standin the light of the lime
Life's a bitch with some pussy-ass rhymes
But they always on my dick when they see me
I think beneath that point, they want to be me
I don't break my neck to be in other niggas' videos
Standin around like hoes
But them other niggas gotta do it for pub'
Because nobody recognize them in the club
And when they see me they want to kick it, so people'll stare
Quit swinging on my dick hairs
And as soon as I leave, the muthafuckas start yappin
Run they mouth like a bitch, better than they do rappin
And I don't need a crew
Because a crew can't do shit that a real nigga can't do
So to all y'all niggas that's down with a crew
How does it feel ot be number two?
Kissin another nigga's ass so you can slick sign a autograph
And move people out his path
And that's the reason I'ma diss you
Stuff your mouth with tissue
And kiss my black ass",Kizz My Black Azz

""And you have believed those ideas and concepts""

How de fuck can you believe, that people turns to spirits?
Don't run with that bullshit because I don't want to hear it
The shit that you learned in the church - it only was worth
A bottle of piss, now lemme tell you what you missed :
Jesus was'nt white like the lion devil told you
He's the same devil that brought you from africa and sold you!
Made you take the white men's name and now you're one with the same
Playin' all of his devilish games
Ho' runnin' 'round in 93' with your slavemaster name 
like a Fool happy as you can be
Believe it in a burnin' hot hell
But the only hell you got was in the white men's jail cell
The devil owns every fuckin' thing
I doubt you can't make it unless you can tap or fall or sing
Now niggaz will be trippin' 'bout the shit I'm 'bout to speak
How can you go from the streets turnin' to chicks and eatin' pig feet
Lookin' for dope face turnin' to a hog
Mothafuckaz happy you ain't died from the smog
Niggaz got these white devil bitches for the ho's
Don't bring 'em in the room 'cause the bitches are doomed
 ..

""And you have believed those ideas and concepts""
""And you have believed those ideas and concepts""

If you see a nigga with a white ho' beat his mothafuckin' ass
Remind a mothafucka of what happend in the past
Let me tell you somethin' that I think you oughta know
He's the same devil that came from ... 30 years ago
Then you got niggaz that's blacker than the night
Runnin' 'round town sayin' their best friends are white
Niggaz like that are gonna hang up from a tree
And burn 'em up aloud and let everybody see
'cause in 93' we'll come and burn down your store
When niggaz sign up ....... 54'
If you hate the devil you should fall right then
'cause all we're lookin' for is a few good men
So niggaz here we go here we go it's a trip
The devil separates you by a blood and a crip
'cause he knows if you're together yo we'll beat off in his ass
Go to white neighborhood and start to blast 
Nigga you believed ..

Move, now let me fall into the groove
Breakin' niggas off but I break 'em off smooth
Used to try to pimp, but the ho's got old
A nigga can't remember how much dope that I sold
In my youth, the shit is the truth, go to jail for the proof
Niggaz makin' records sellin' two copies
Tryin' to fuck with me because your rap's sloppy
Now back in your cage your wings are short
You tall, dirty motherfuckers dig the basketball courts
I can tear ya ass up in a rhyme
But I won't mention your name, 'cause that's a waste of my time
So I call my niggas, Chip and Dollar Bill
Scoop up to the hill when we move in for the kill
Never retreat you dirty nigga take a seat
Big motherfucking feet, with your wack ass beats
So train ""What up?"" cut 'em with the shape
Make the nigga walk the plank, the dirty nigga always stank
Nigga better raise like the Titanic
Ain't from Atlantic, but I'll make your ass panic
And that's only one step, pride is kept
A glass of piss weigh as much as your rep

Quad is kept, I step
With the nine millimeter come
Complicated with the gat to the back of the devil's head
Then I pull the trigger till he dead
Red rum, all I can see when I close my eyes at night
Dreamin' of vision of murderers comin' with butt, while Satan's out to fight
I ain't rappin' to tight
You're fuckin' with a motherfuckin' madman
That don't take shit from a redneck chick
You can put your mouth up my steel dick
And suck until I pull my trigger come, ejaculate my gun
What'll be done, when I be makin' your blood run
Into the stretch
And motherfuck that white trigger that got his fuckin' ass beat
Many be pussy poppin' can't attail for that knee
But not so many as I gave so much a buck, buck from me
Buck, but it gets it up, I'm tryin' to defend my own skin
From a nigga who loves crackers, so come and ya jack 'em
Sleep with the enemy and get treated as such
The convicted followed no bust, and lust for you
To make that one false move

But if every nigga grabbed a nine
And started shootin' motherfucker's it would put 'em in line [Repeat: x2]

[Dollar Bill]
I was never the one to run with the pack
But was the mastermind for settin' up the jack
So if they every saw my beamin' it wasn't from crack
I must of been beamin' them grubs to hit the sack
And let me remember the days of way back
When everybody was homies and no one played that
Rockin' 'em, sockin' 'em, knockin' 'em out the box now tell me what's up
Look at me wrong fool, you get tossed up
I mean fucked up, you lucked up
I didn't come out a long time ago, with the fast or the slow flow
And callin' me wack, no that's a no no
The style just so wild, while your style just so-so
Nasty, they can't pass me, it's too fast see
Niggas that blast fast I don't let 'em blast me
Usin' my mind like a nine millimeter to abuse
So don't make one false move

You want to fuck her, do you want to fuck her, 
The bitch is a ho, yo I thought I'd let you know
You want to fuck her, nigga you can fuck her, 
The bitch is a ho yo I thought I'd let you know

The bitch is a stripper but thinks she's a star
Still rides the bus, can't afford a fuckin' car
Try to be the shit, needs a foot up the ass
Ya stanky stanky bitch get a new bus pass
I see her all the time gettin' kicks from hard dicks
Your pussy really stinks, who the fuck bought you drinks
At the club, waitin' till two
So you can have a niggaz dick shoved in you
Yo, don't know the meanin' of cleanin' your cock
Ya burnt seven niggaz, yo, around the block
You always leave a trail, 'cause your pussy, it smell
Fuckin' ho, ya need to quit thinkin' that you're the shit
Your stomach fulla nut and just flushed a baby
Ya dumb fuckin' bitch yo ya must be crazy
So get back in your place ya little bitch I ain't no sucka
'Cause all my niggaz fucked her

(CHORUS)

Well here we go in this video bitch
Crabs on her pussy, got no choice but to itch
Yo, she suckin' niggaz dick for two seconds of airtime
Went so fast, didn't see your triflin' ass
Always at the functions fuckin'
Always into somethin', fuck it, you ain't worth nothin'
You're like a disease that's what you are
Fucked the Whole Click in the back of my car
Then had the nerve to leave a stain on my seat
I shoulda slapped yo ass for doin' the same to my sheets
Every week you're on Soul Train
Lookin' like a ho, doin' the same fuckin' thing
Stretch marks, lookin' all nasty and shit
Tryin' to keep down your shirt to prevent from gettin' hurt
But 'cha brought it on yourself ya ho
Ya lost a stupid bitch and don't know where the fuck to go
So quit tryin' to pretend
'Cause you'll get broke down by a nigga named Ren
So peep it out real slow
Next time you about to pimp a ho

(CHORUS)

If ya want to fuck her think again
She might not be the type of bitch you want to put your dick in
But she might suck a good dick, yo, and make ya nut quick so
Never let her go 'cause she's nothin' but a ho
But then again she might start to bitch 'cause she's nothin' but a bitch
Shoot the bitch, a dead bitch, then bury the bitch, a gone bitch
What else can I say to take the place of that?
I saw my nigga DJ Trane shoot a bitch in the back

'Cause fool I'm a soldier with a regiment
10,000 niggaz marchin' to your residence
Fuck the president and his red, white, and blue
I never leave a clue with the shit that I do
Sport the black 80, creepin' with the flashlight
Comin' with this phat shit just last night
The mad scientist from the center of the Earth
Droppin' crazy shit whenever I drop a verse
Niggaz in a rage, want to see me in a cage
But um, I cocked the gauge when the ink hits the page
Fuck a grammy show and your mammy so now
What the fuck ya gonna do when I bust out the zoo

You're fuckin' with the nigga Ren with the phat shit

I'll give ya that I don't give a fuck frame of mind
Make ya want to shoot the police in the back

A buffalo soldier without the dreadlocks
I don't give a damn, I created this shit
With the real niggaz way back in '87
Niggaz walkin' on my footprints in nine five
Fools hit 'em foul, can't hit a line drive
So get the hell away from my throne or a zone

Fuck the police 'cause I still feel the same
And fuck a lotta niggaz bein' whack at the game
I don't give a damn

Ren be bustin' raps, niggaz bustin' caps
The bitch made nigga killa, that's who I be
When bitch made niggaz come and try 
Be a politician kidnapp, who gives a fuck about 'em
Nigga never gave a fuck, I can live without 'em
Niggaz want to journey down the black brick road
They can see me changin' in an I don't give a fuck mode
Then I explode, better hide your neck
Ya new whack niggaz never get my respect
Then center of the Earth is where I dwell
Your shit never sell, I got 'cha trippin' in a livin' hell
So back the fuck out my way, that's what I'm sayin'
'Cause I'll be havin' hypocrite niggaz balls hangin'

Niggaz can't see me on the madden with Frisco
I'm runnin' fools straight to the dirt
While my man Train talkin' on the phone, the evil curse
Niggaz waste gas drivin' down the same streets
And hood rats wishin' for the passenger seats
Flag 'em down, like they flaggin' down to get a taxi
Too good to ride a bus, drinkin' is a must
Another day kickin' back, the scientist is hard at work
Thinkin' how to get paid, kickin' back in the shade
Or call Will and Temple where my homie down by Zeenie
With the bald head it's too hot for the beanie
Sittin' on the porch niggaz run the stop sign
Hookers sell they bodies 'round the way ain't hard to find
Right in the corner of McDonald's parkin' lot
Peepin' out their hair 'cause that spot is hot
And that's real

Nigga gotta keep my shit real
Lettin' punk niggaz know how the fuck I feel
Pussy ass niggaz always want to be around
A nigga like Ren when I put that real shit down

Randy up the street cuttin' up the fresh fade
And Compton P.D. around the corner 'bout to raid
The yellow helicopter hangin' 'round like a gnat
And hood rats yellin' out a car where the party at
My robbin' train go and get a duce
And niggaz 'round the way don't give a damn about a gang truce
But I gotta lotta love for my people
And like they ain't tryin', niggaz just keep dyin'
I won't be like most niggaz and just come 
And shoot my video in Compton and disappear for a year
We make fools like that shake the spot
One for the treble jack yo ass in the parkin' lot
'Cause handkerchief headed niggaz come around fakin'
Braggin' 'bout that money they be makin'
Boot lickin' butt dancin' niggaz just better chill
Before I tell 'em how I feel and that's real

Yeah, uh, break it down
All y'all busta ass niggaz
Do it like this, 1995
Uh, yeah, come all y'all fake ass niggaz to this

Goin' to the pad hit the beach up on the pager
Here comes Korleone up the street in the mini-Blazer
While the dominoes start to get shakin'
The same time that the barbique start bakin'
I don't eat swine, but I take a turkey burger
I can't fade worms, that books' full of terms
Homies pass by, some stop and conversate
On a gang a topics we start to debate
On why in black neighborhoods is always towed down
And white neighborhoods ain't one piece a trash 'round
So we gotta do for self and quit bitchin'
Recycle black dollars so we can roll Impalas
Every street got their own rap artist
On every cover every brother got a gun tryin' to look the hardest
But some deserve a slap 'cause they laid down they strap
When they hear that's a rap and that's real

And check it out y'all (Yo, I'm still the same nigga)

This nigga be creepin' on fools all day and night
I got determined millimeters nigga, fuck a fight
'Cause niggaz don't scrap no mo', that's a no no
Fools get hot, they shoot yo' ass on the spot
'Cause bitch made niggaz get fucked like a ho
But be outta work like that nigga Arsenio
'Cause niggaz be talkin' shit behind my back
Wishin' they could get they hands sweatty on my nut sack
I ain't from Ohio, but I'm a player
So pussy ass niggaz what the fuck ya gotta say a
Poppa gotta brand new bag when I rock
'Cause niggaz on the corner sellin' shit out the ziplock
Uh, but me and my niggaz sit back and relax
While I fuck it up bustin' on them tight ass tracks
Yeah, you niggaz know where you can find me
I'm kickin' back in Compton with my niggaz behind me
Still the same nigga

(CHORUS)

I used to be a magician, but a nigga gave up tricks
'Cause my assistance was fuckin' too many dicks
So I start my mission, leave my residence
Fuck it, nigga makin' dead presidents
But niggaz be wantin' they hands in my pocket say gimme
For a penny, all they feelin' is the jimmy
Like Rick James I'm bustin' out on the funk
Nothin' up my sleeve, the shit is in the trunk
But don't make me bop that shit, and it's on
'Cause I can get rocky like Sylvester Stallone
Niggaz shootin' stones, motherfuck a sly
If I wanted to I could hit ya with my third eye
Then you'll be in a deep sleep
So bring the band by, 'cause nigga chokin' like I mad fly
I'm still takin' niggaz out
With the shit that's droppin' out my mouth
'Cause, I'm still the same nigga

(CHORUS)

Yeah minute you win it, a nigga ain't a loser
It's a black nigga hittin' corners on a beach cruiser
Or you might catch a nigga in a Chevy
'Cause my motherfuckin' shit is so heavy
Rap skits kicked to the curb, they gets no play
When I'm rollin' in the 4-54 in L.A.
Fuck the radio and they format
I got bitch made nigga killa wrote on my doormat
So niggaz don't ring my bell
I gotta bad attitude and I'm mad as hell
'Cause I break God damn necks with my rhymes
Niggaz in the street don't want to fuck with mine
Devil's be askin' what I did
Tell 'em I make funky ass records, plus I built pyramids
But niggaz in the streets I'm a good fella
In the trench like Gotti, and the umbrella
Still the same nigga

MC Ren,"These niggas be actin' like I fucked
And didn't call 'em for weeks
Like they wantin' a nigga dick
In between they butt cheeks
They straight bitchy
Without their bleedin' and Kotexes
The villain that go to Texas
Nigga got a plan full of O's and X's
What's yo' game plan?
Niggas be sayin' you sabotagin' me
But yo' bitch be suckin' my dick,
She be tellin' me that you dodgin' me
Like Piazza, a nigga gots ta,
Keep my roster, with bitches slidin' home,
No lickin' yo' shit, yo' bitch is gone
Niggas be thinkin' they Machiavelli,
Tryin' to bring drama
Soon as these niggas whoop that ass,
You talkin' Dear Mama
But face to face, these niggas be cheesin' like Velveeta,
Lookin' smoked out,
Hitin' mo' pipes than Peter
Stuck with broke hoes, broke and
Pussies that they be fuckin',
Used up and sideways
Stretck marks for days,
She about two-hun,
Gotta get pissy drunk,
To fuck her and have fun

[Chorus]
These niggas and hoes act the same,
Can't tell em apart,
Always runnin' 'round
Lookin' for some shit to start.
These bitches run they mouth,
Nigga, constantly
All in mine, nigga
All the time
It ain't my fault 
That yo' punk ass broke
Mad, 'cause you only got
Stress to smoke.
I heard that shit that you was plottin'
Nigga you can try
To fuck with MC Ren,
But you must be high

Niggas be high because 
They workin nine to five
But the Villain be hibernatin'
Wakin' up at five PM
You see them niggas be bitchy because
I won't let 'em up on my team
And give 'em a title like Hakeem,
I'm peelin' caps like tangerines
Tellin' niggas I should
Break 'em off chips
Get 'em in clubs free
And take 'em on trips
Free-loadin' ass niggas
Lose all they sense
When they think they gon' floss 
Off my expense
Niggas be goin' corner to corner
Bringin' up the bill
Askin' questions like the popos
Tryin' to see if I made a mill'
Then they take that weak shit
Back to they home fo' pillow
She shakin' her head like you tellin' the truth
But she want yo' ass to walk
What the fuck you expected?
Always bitchin' at me
When she fuckin' yo' ass,
Nigga she be seein' me.
Go look in the room,
A costume, fo' Halloween,
Of that black nigga, you know who
So you can live yo' dream

[Chorus]

I hear yo' ho punk bitches talkin' shit,
Tryin' to have some say
Tellin' other hoes they wouldn't
Give me no time of day
Still livin' with they mommy
She babysittin' while you fuckin'
Gettin' county cheques and money
From them niggas that you dick suckin'
But nigga, why these bitches all in mine?
Why, nigga, hearin' bullshit all the time?
Hoes from high school be wishin'
They coulda got wit this dick
You know how they be in the car-hop clicks,
Muthafuckin' tricks
Now these hoes jockin'
Like all up on my style
You broke bitches, 
How you like me now?
Actin' like makin' cheese is a muthafuckin' crime
If I said ""drop yo' panties"",
Bitch you drop em in a dime

MC Ren,"Chorus: X2
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause its do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? (why?)
Cause I'm ruthless for life

Nigga ten years passed and we still up in that ass
Will I make it or continue and
Look at all the shit you in
Eazy does it like happy like the shit we used to do
5 niggaz comin' out the see-P-T so fuck you
Time changed for the good
Niggaz in the hood be comin' up feel it
Can you set it off, for again, you know you should
Yo let's that this shit back
To 1989
Where this nigga shoot and bust and niggaz know they couldn't find
Dream Team lovers
Egyptian fan base
Feelin' on the scene, all the fools got erased
Threw a mothafuckin' monkey wrench up in the rap game
Since I hooked up with E, shit ain't ever been the same
Opened up doors for the niggaz that be thinkin
that your flows be on tizight
Bitin' what I wrizite
Jokin' when I recite
Feelin' manuscripts
When I MC, if it ain't rough it ain't me

Chorus X2

Yo mothafuckin' G'z, nigga like Eric Wright
You can floss for your bitch, but you know this shit is tight
Cause when y'all niggaz started rappin', who'd you try and be?
I'ma slap you cause you lying, if you don't be sayin' me
Or the other 3, that the FBI be phone tappin'
Shoot the government before you niggaz started rappin'
Now its ? city, I gotta bomb it like Iraq
Use my alias, spend my nights at the shack
Ruthless attack all the way to two thou
Try to block it out, but you never knew how
And when I walk through the crowd
I'm seeing mothafucka's bread
I hear their bitches sayin' ask MC Ren
Makin' fools sway when I roll to King Tet's
Because I started cussin' all you fools gettin' checks
Ruthless for life, see that be my state of mind
y'all can kiss my black ass one more time

Chorus X2

I run a hundred miles just so I can MC
villain want that bomb so I get with L.T.
Ain't nothin' changed
We find 'em, fuck 'em, then flee
While you hatin', pillow talkin', with that bitch, she want me
Niggaz weed crazy, Dre and Snoop turned you out
Now y'all cristal sippin', y'all niggaz be trippin'
Make the West look like ass, all full of shit
Invest in drug money, shit, still gettin' in
What it take for y'all quit
Ruthless got it on lock
y'all shootin' videos tryin' to look like Pac
Here we come, here we come, blowin' up your spot
My little brother Jubee and the big homie Rock
Full circle, all this shit gon' repeat
When this shit drop, niggaz clownin' in the streets
The saga continues right before your eyes
Who really gives a fuck?
Cause this is ruthless for life

MC Ren,"[ verse 1: mc ren ]
Niggas in the hood lookin at me crazy
Tellin niggas like they wanna fuck my old lady
Same fuckin shit every day at 8 o'clock
Nigga, start my day off raisin off the cock
I throw the khakis on, with the t-shirt
Never knowin when a nigga might hit the dirt
I'm thinkin, how in the fuck can I get high quicker
Mix the blunt with some muthafuckin malt liquor
These niggas that I love, I don't trust em, but I stay close to em
In case I gotta do em
We from the same set, but that don't mean shit no mo'
I be premeditatin with the .44 (.44)
My hoe be tellin a nigga to peel they caps back
Cause I know where them niggas hide they shit at
Shit be on my mind, return a shot call
Broke as fuck, it's about to get hot, y'all

[ chorus: big rocc ]
Niggas starvin while you're home with the mills
Niggas killin while you're doin dope deals
Out flossin, throwin 100 $ bills
Time to set yo ass up for the kill
Death of a shot caller, who can you trust?
It might be your number 1 nigga that bust
A cap, he's the next one to take charge
Smoke him and his bitch in his backyard

[ verse 2: mc ren ]
A nigga's sittin on the curb
Hear that nigga come bumpin with the suburb
Got my niggas on point, same niggas he be fuckin hoes with
And rollin up the blunts when he wanna get lit
Homie, when that nigga put the mutahfucka in park?
That's the signal, little nigga, pump 3 in his heart
Don't feel shit, cause it's real shit, he a bitch
Niggas in the hood doin bad while he gettin rich
Off this shit we be killin niggas fo'
Can't make a move less this muthafucka say so
Nigga, fuck that, I'm runnin this shit
I'ma look him in his eyes when his punk-ass gettin hit
But if you miss, nigga, I'ma kill you
Cause if he get away, muthafucka, then we all through
Fuck 3 shots, nigga, add 2
And handle what the fuck you gotta do
Kill the shot caller

Man, you know we been smokin niggas for this muthafucka
This nigga ain't paid us shit, man
(I know, dog)
Hold up, hold up, hold up, dog
Man, gimme the gat, I - damn
Hey nigga, you got my muthafuckin money?
Nigga, fuck yo money, nigga
No nigga, fuck you
( *shots* )
Oh shit, oh shit...
Damn!

[ verse 3: tha chill ]
These o.g.'s got me twisted like twizzler
Got me heated and hot, and all I'm thinkin is killin ya
Peelin ya cap back, like starter, fool
I'm comin to get you niggas off my block, so I pack a full
Glock with big slugs, and you know I buck no doubs
Cause you know a nigga steelo, how I did them fools a week ago
One week passed, I'm hearin you wanna wet us
When you see ren, rocc, tha chill, you're puttin on the jetters
What the fuck? these niggas tryin to bust on me?
So I'm cockin up the can and ready to make them do some gas
And do some flippin, and all that
Cause niggas out here shot call, get they ass jacked
And that's the main fact, big payback for you punk muthafucks
Disrespectin the crew, it's mandatory that I buck
Ass down from comptown, mr. shot caller
Gonna be a fast faller if he ain't a fast talker
Fast walker, or better yet better be a fast runner
Chill on the scope with the cannon, finna gun ya
Dumpin 9 to the gut like ""nigga, what? ""
This ol' b.g. big baller, fuck the muthafuckin shot caller

Niggas be thinkin the Villain has stopped givin Compton props
Nigga you smokin off that muthafuckin stress
That your ass was chokin
CPT, I'm straight out, that's my muthafuckin heart
You can't tear me apart, they gave a nigga a start
It's crazy niggas in that bitch, plenty hoes to match
Plenty pussies to fuck, and plenty bitches to catch
Niggas be doin what they got to do, family's a need
Compton niggas hit that pussy so hard, make it bleed
Niggas hittin switches, and movin pounds of dope
So cluck-head muthafuckas got they rocks to smoke
Niggas be killin other niggas when they get in they path
White muthafuckas gives a fuck, they sit back and laugh
These undercover tight bitches be playin the tease
Got my dick hard as fuck but she want the pennies
Niggas be hatin 'cause I'm doin what the fuck they want to do
Niggas still be havin love for you (be havin love)

(Verse 2)
Niggas be at the park, tryin to set the pussy up for the night
Baby you can suck this dick just as long as you don't bite
Go back to the crib, we do that soopafly scene
Fuck your ass in the tub, rub my dick with vaseline
Make my shit stretch all down your throat
Quit tryna talk with that shit in your mouth just write a note
Or use sign language if you need some air
I'll chase your ass around the room, fuck that pussy anywhere
I'm just a Compton nigga, no matter where the fuck I be
Niggas don't get high, with me, I'm just writin what I see
It's reality that's all a real nigga know
All that ""Slob/Cuzzin"" and bullshit - it gots to go
All these niggas know, Villain kickin the real
I gives a fuck how these muthafuckas feel
Niggas hate me 'cause I'm doin what the fuck they want to do
Niggas still be havin love for you (and I know)

A motherfuckin fiend, before I became a teen
the villain was fuckin with bitches instead of cones or ice cream
Niggas be killing the villain like aids with whack rhymes
these niggas don't be havin no lyrics
All they talk about is nines and chronic
The villain be doing that but I can switch up
kick some unreleased shit nigga pick your bitch up
The villain be killin you niggas that's running with clicks
Ren be own em'
niggas be running with clicks cause they can't do it on they own lonesome
From CPT to NYC, I keeps it hot
bitches be worshiping a nigga with shrines and parking lots.
Ten years of damage motherfucking rap god
traded in the Dayton's on the foe with 3 tripods
The villain be travelling at the speed of light, cause I might
be uniden-tah-fied if I come whack, mothefuckers late at night
Niggas be waking up forgetting the whole thing
nigga it ain't over till the hoe sing, bitch sing it

Ain't shit changed, still making bitches pussy's hot
hanging with niggas from Compton carryin big glocks
Fucking em' car hops trippin off some paint and gold D'z

Hanging with rap niggas like Lez and Joe Clair
niggas from Compton multiply and seen everywhere
Making your spot hot attract the feds and protest
kidnapping bitches and make the scene grotesque
Real niggas and bitches niggas hanging out
CPT dwelling shots reigning out
Selling coke, hoes taking dicks down they throat
bitch niggas coming up pissin all you find is a ransom note
New release, promotin fucking police
crooked motherfuckers hot cause I won't give em' a piece

A nigga sittin on the curb rats catch whip lash
same hoes when I was little, fucking niggas for cash
Now they baby mommas cause they wanted niggas with dope
stuck with stretch marks and niggas names tattered by they throat
Some on they tittys, ankles and ass
every neighborhood got these stankin tricks from the past
They be at the clubs, pussy's used up
they tiitys six feet, there stomachs lookin bruised up
Real niggas turn the light out
nigga till they child's through
These hoes today be havin niggas rob you
Just to come up, so niggas can fuck em' with cheap weed
makin motherfuckers go and drop a week seed
Thinkin they max Julie fake ass macks

And you're more optomistic than the Sounds of Blackness
Flip lines that rip through the chest cavity
And I keep going and going just like an Energizer battery

Flattery will get you nowhere, unless it's the derriere
And that will get you everywhere
Went to the flea market, was in the cark, parked it
Big fat blunts, if you got it then spark it

And with the fisticuffs came the fists
And you've joined Steven Segal on the Marked for Death hitlist
Went back to the 70's and brothers got on grants
'Cause they can step to some sisters and say ""Slap me some skins""

Honey dip, and take the squad to the teepee
Hit it off, smoke a cig, watch a little TV
And if there ain't no papes there's no show
I'll just chill and return to kick em in the grill

[Chorus]

[Red Hot Lover Tone]
Bust a style while I do it, if you know it oh you knew it
If you knew it then you knew it, if I catch a punk chewin
I'm a drop the flavor fluid on his head, yep I flew it
And like Aretha Franklin, your moms is jumping to it

So, so, so, where did you go, what do ya know
SO many people want to be fly like Joe
G.I., E.I., oh lots and lots
And rapper can top the Red Hot (Not!)

R&B rips hip-hop (Not!)
MC Serch is gonna flip-flop (Not!)
All my hoes look like sasquatch (Not!)
And George Bush gets nuff props

Well, anyway, Imma slay slay lay
Pull a hoe around my way and make hooker souffle
Red Hot Lover Tone would like to thank MC Serch
Yo, you're chill for making me a part of history
Kicking em in the grill

[Nas]
Finesse, keep a Tech-9 in my dresser
Lyrical professor, keep you under pressure
Mind like a computer, the inserter
Paragraphs of murder, the nightclub flirter

This is Nas, kid, you know how it runs
I'm waving automatic guns at nuns
Sticking up the preachers in the church, I'm a stone crook
Serial killer, who works by the phone book

For you I got a lot to shoot my songs in here
My rhymes are hotter than a prostitute with ghonnerea
On the mic I let vocabulary spill
(It's like that why'all) That why'all, kick em in the grill

[Chorus]

[Chubb Rock]
The Chubbsta breaks ?stabbabi? fakes, steady rate h
The panty mix the verse, looks to Serch, kick him in the grill again
Part 2, sequel of ""The Dialect, The Derelect""
The murder licks, Vanilla kicks alive on the crucifix

Coming around the mountain, when he comes to sell more record bums
Digest the lyrics then you suck on some Tums
Crumbs with the energy from the lump sums
And lips to to the mixture to the friction and then you're
Hummmmmmming, the door rings, yo I'm coming

To a theater near you, get your popcorn and your brew
And a Guinness Stout, check the clout when I'm about
'Cause YOU are a BLABBERMOUTH
A blabber, it gets no badder

Lyrics on a diet cause it gets no fatter
Like a Gewn to the Guthrien, jumping up on the scene
With the Serches with the verses
Word up, the illustrious

Rapper dapper sapper, you want us to sell out your wish
My lips have never touched the circumference of a spliff
And if you see some Coke or some spill
With some ill pill, yo kick me in the grill grill

[Chorus]

[MC Serch]
So here's a true and false, tell me if it's factable
You want to kill the Klan, shoot the fans a tractor pull
Got crazy game, so no one can stop me
But ah-yo, I'm white, I guess my game is hockey

Or basketball, football, taking papes in poker
If honeydip got a moneyclip I'm gonna stroke her
Wait a minute, chill chill, can't swing
'Cause my girl ain't my girl no more, now she got a ring

Respect my wisdom like I respect myself
To to G I'll put you in a tree like the Keebler elves
You couldn't be The Mack if you had the car, the hat, the hoe
And your shit would still be out the back like a patio

'Cause I saw you eating pig knuckles, with Frankie Knuckles
In a bar called Chuckles wearing name plate belt buckles
Goddamn your life is flimsy
Gave you enough respect, but gave it back cause I was stingy

So from the cons and pros to the pros and the cons
Call me a motherfucker I'll say ""Yeah I fucked your moms""
Until she calls back I'm gonna chill
Peace to Red Hot Lover Tone, Chubb Rock, kick em in the grill

[Chorus]",Back to the Grill
MC Serch,"Cast away all of your rhymes into a shredder
Got with my girl, the first day that I met her
Tip-toe, tip-toe, try to step light
And if you say I can't well then I might, be
All I can be without the army or the navy
'Cause aiyyo aiyyo I'm not with the service
Hurt us, no nada, nothin' I'm too thick
Called you Jimmy cause you're actin like a prick
Goody goody two-shoes, here comes the good news
Serch went solo, so do me a favor would you's
Come come come, and run out your drawers
Can you dig it?  It just hit the stores

Yeah, c'mon now, come come now
C'mon now, can you dig it?
Uh, c'mon now, come come now
C'mon now, can you dig it?

I come from no rock, so open up your lids
All up and down your spine I'll send the shivs
It's gettin' mighty nippy
Nipsey Russell I remember sellin' Jiffy
Hit me two times then hit me two times more
Hey yo chill, what'd you hit me for?
Oh yeah for the groove, but not the groovy train
I feel the vibes, but what does that pertain?
It's how I rock the hoodies with the hoods but I never did no hoodin'
And saw ""Gladiators"" cause of my man, Cuba Gooding
Jr., Sr., Mister Mister Big
Shake a leg, break a leg but stay, hip to the jig

Uh, c'mon now, come come now
C'mon now, can you dig it?
Uh uhh, c'mon now, come come now.
Yeah, c'mon now, can you dig it?

I've seen times change, watchin' the rhymes change
From good to bad to worse from worse to hearse
Why is it the hearse makes all the papes?
I know you're mad phony ya know like counterfeit tapes
Hit one, strip one, rip one to the bad boy and ya find
There ain't nothin' there no more
You're blowin' smoke up, where there ain't no sunlight
And I don't need K-F-C to show me how it's done right
I rip mics I grab mics I wreck mics until I'm hoarse
And when I can't rhyme I'll go home and read The Source
Peace to the streets the thugs the vandals and the hoods
You dig it, you dig it, you dug it? Good

Then c'mon now, come come now
You've got to c'mon now, can you dig it?
C'mon now, come come now
C'mon now uhh, can you dig it?

Diggin' the vibe cause the vibe is what I'm diggerin'
Triggerin' samples bigger sounds Serch must begin again
Did what I had to dig, a tractor-trailer and a rig
Cannot get this big; your voice is foul, stop smokin' cigs
And put your life back in order
Met Chantelle at Taco Bell and made a, run for the border
Saw all the dust and ma and pa doowops is who I trust
And some old school kid tried to come back but his lyrics were all rust
And mustard ketchup, sauerkraut and relish
Sell this crap I like to rap but hey yo that's my fetish
Kick the smooth style, I hope that y'all can get it
And if you don't you dig it you got it come on and kick it

C'mon now, come come now
C'mon now, can you dig it?
C'mon now, come come now
C'mon now, can you dig it?

I'm hip to the dig, I'm hip to the dig
I'm hip to the dig, I'm hip to the dig
I'm hip to the dig, I'm hip to the dig
I'm hip to the dig

MC Serch,"[ VERSE 1 ]
I can be paid, and don't have to have money
Jump off a bridge, and don't have to use bungee
I like Cypress Hill, and don't have to smoke blunts
And when the beat comes in, you don't have to jump
Oh yeah, it don't have to be 'oh no'
Serch rides the rhythm, but it doesn't have to flow
You can be beefin, and not be a Tom
Go get skins, and don't have to be a John
I can raise the roof, and not have a home
Go solo, and don't have to be alone
I can be Simon, and don't have to draw
Step to the a.m. and not sit by the door
I can have pockets, and don't have to be swollen
Fat-ass beat, and it don't have to be stolen
Went a 1000 places, and didn't have to be hike that
World full of hate, and it don't have to be like that

[ CHORUS ]
	And it don't quit
	And it don't stop
	When it don't quit
	Then it don't stop
	When it don't quit
	Then it don't stop
	It keeps on and on		(2x)

[ VERSE 2 ]
I can come ghetto, and don't have to be a bastard
Hold a conversation, and don't have to have the last word
Shoot the gift swift, and not miss the street
Even - ehm - and not come off the beat
Oh yeah, be ??? without shootin at the earth
Even be gold, and not have any worth
You can beat beef, and don't need utensils
Write ruff rhymes without pens and pencils
Mad low end, and I don't have any treble
Be like rock, and it don't have to metal
Be in Detroit and don't have to be a Piston
Tell me a white lie, yo, I don't have to listen
I can walk, and I don't have the need
Catch a cut, but I don't have to bleed
Go to a club, and I don't have to sweat
Chill, time to go, but you don't have to get up yet

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
I can be the U.S., and don't have to war
I can get open, and don't need any door
I can get loud, and don't have to scream
Peace to Dr. King, and don't forget about the dream
Oh yes, oh yes, I don't have to be a yes-man
Go get married, and don't have to have a best man
I can be positive, and don't have to be a plus
If you're not gettin papes, then you're not down with Rush
I can have skills, and don't need a trade
I can be in London, don't have to like rain
Nots, nots, nots, and not have any rope
Go take a shower, but don't need any soap
Point me to the mic, I need no rehearsal
Yes, I'm the man, there'll be no role reversal
I can be blue, and don't have to be the jeans
Don't wear the X hat when you don't know what it means

[ CHORUS ]",Don't Have to Be
MC Serch,"""This is probably the most challenging record
 you have ever put on your turntable..""

[MC Serch]
The facts, the facts get fried like your eggs scrambled
truth until it falls off the ledge lays dead or vexed
Tennis feds(?) need the last price, gassed ego
He don't show or know about the last nights and days
of a brother who went for his
My land built on hatred and sent to kids
Ice Cube killed his own and it was square biz
So if I say fuck you to a jew, you know what time it is
Of my own kind but not of my own mind
Came to America but became blind
Chased from the four corners of the earth
But over here it's alright, at least your ass is white
So sit down and mingle with the devil over supper
The only difference between us and a brother is the color
Instead of hittin the last nail in the coffin try to pull it out
And find out what the hard but true is all about

[Chorus]
It's hard.. but it's true
The hard but the true
It's hard.. but it's true
The hard but the true
So hard.. but so true
The hard but the true
It's hard.. but it's true
The hard but the true

[MC Serch]
Hard, what?  Truth sometimes too hard to be true
So I'ma make it stick like glue
Too many times too many crimes get backed up
Case comes up, oops!  Switch all the facts up
Three kids rape a sister at St. John's
and become graduates, instead of cons
Instead of washin drawers or be somebody's whore
College wack buffed and polished and they kept the doors closed
Jail time (yeah?) Wasn't even fazin 'em
Probably one of the fathers gave the school a gymnasium
Korean kills a girl and claims insane, and gets a pardon?
Bring her honor to the court of Nickerson Garden
And get a lifetime sentence of the bent over
Tell a fool, tell a friend and then sent over
Hollow point slugs made of nothin but lead
The hard but true is takin you straight to the head

[Chorus]

[MC Serch]
Reggie McBride, yeah..
Asalaam alaikum to a Muslim
Shalom alaikum is the same to a Hebrew
Peace akeem, akeem peace to a Zulu
Tell me what's the difference why you riffin what's the point of view?
Universal greeting is the same
The game is three-sixty it don't matter what the slang
Gangs of thugs carry slugs use the mind as a glock 9
Wake the ones then shake the ones
then make the ones come into the daytime
And spark the mark labelled X
And knowledge the text
Use the wit not as a whip reload the clip then shoot from the hip
Cause yo!  This is some ol' next shit
One circle, one hurdle, one jump
One nation under the groove, and then over the hump
of racist dogs, that keep barkin in the street
Serch'll bring the hard but true to your feet, complete!

[Outro]
It's hard.. but it's true
The hard but the true
It's hard.. but yo, it's true
The hard but the true
It's hard.. but it's true
The hard but the true
So hard.. so true
The hard but the true

Yeah Wolf & Epic, cool
Ay you, ay you ay you, ay you ay you
Ay you, it's hard but it's true
Ay you, ay you ay you ay you
It's hard but it's true, you hebrew or you jew
Your christian, your muslim, your islam, your brother, your sister
It's hard but it's true.. peace",Hard But True
MC Serch,"So y'all thought I was comin back with some old R&B huh?
Check it...

Here it, comes!
Yo, here it is or there it was
But where was it when you need it?  Because
You fall to the waistline when you waste rhymes
Serch got it flowin when it comes to fat beats and basslines
I heard the rumors and the fables
Remove them like tumors on the tables
Boomers for the willing and the able
So turn to the next page in your manual and flim-flam, all over the jam
Chill
Lounge
Kick your ten little toes up at the end of this
Razor blade and save your spade
As the groove pummets you to another dimension
May I just mention
This is a map, it's for all made for climbin
And you're stuck to your grip like an aluminum sidin
Hiding in the back is for crumbs
Hon, here it comes!

Hit it off
Kick it off
Hit it off
Here it, comes!

be	-boys, decots will try to destroy
Delpoy the truth in black hoods and black boots
Caps get rocked only when they're fitted
Lyrics get dropped only when they're lifted
So swing time is one up, the vo-chords run amuck
Whatup?  Whatup?  I got mine and you got yours
War's a factor, we'll perspire
And someone in the crow yells fire fire
we don't need no water, let it burn yo burn yo
We don't need no water let it burn... so it burnt
Learn your lesson well, if I don't then I guess you get jelled
Swell, heads go down like the sun and here it comes

Chorus

Fiddle-fee, fiddle-fie, fiddle-foe, fiddle-fum
I smell the blood of an English
muffin, huffin and puffin
sellin his soul, J-E-L-L-O, ya know?
Roll with the squad who makes back flips stack
Hits upon this so play at your own risk
Tisk, tisk, tisky, ya shoulda used Wisk
Now you shouldn't appeal to be a Biff
Insist that your motor's on scramble
Remember the skips and enter the sample
Ample flow is created by the tears and years
Of proved and blue, perched on the front steps
Checkin for the bass loop
So the troops pulled out and the tows are paid, set and done
And here it comes...
I said here it comes!

Chorus",Here It Comes
MC Serch,"Parties all around start checkin for the substance
The context you suspect, but I expect
when Serchlite hits the break..
.. headache, BREAK FOOL
with the groove that's strictly metropolitan
Past go, I'll let you go again the pen emulates
what's heard from the four wheel
And Babyface ain't never seen this crazy whip appeal
Sealed with the hits and blow cause I got hits to go
fists to flow Michel'le Michelle-low under the mistletoe
I let my missile go, yo
Hands get pound, when it comes down to slick rhymes
No respect in the deuce cool I'm vickin mines
Burnished in New York kids that rolled diesel
Kids swoll big like they were shootin up an AIDS needle
So cling to your mom's memories, calamity's a remedy
to recollect childhood memory lane
Envision, the picture, the frame
The beat that rumbles into the brain
Stains grim gloom carefree feelin, up a buildin cap peelin
Slash from the unwillin blastin off, passin off
to the prevention, locked in detention
Wielding fiends, your dome starts STRETCHIN
To hit the hot spot, and stomp hysterical
The groove that makes you thank God for miracles
Pinnacles are peakin there you find Serch..

Rhythm rung gets designed for the kind
that's the deaf the dumb and blind seen here and stated with that
And if you're not gonna hit that, let me rip that
rhythm hit the rhymes, we give 'em, we leave 'em
Then we'll ghost to the most so the concrete is secured
to endure, three-hundred and sixty-five days of the unsure
is the way the crumb comes clompin
That's why these boots were made for stompin
Comp is little to none, when the riddle is sung
When who is rappin no beats gets paid
The answer as he gets sprayed by the kids who survived
the playground, of the steel
Who used a fat and funky, as a sort of shiv
Deal to the crew that rolls in batallions
If water was slaughter I'd have to order by the gallon
Pestacides killed the pests, the rest are out the back
like sweats so jump out the projects, out the building
Out your condo, out your crib, out your co-op!
And let me rip the hip-hop again
Oh shit, Skeff Anslem, he gets props again
Let out the grunt, let out the funk, from out your trunk
Feel the bass and let it PUMP PUMP PUMP

Float up the damn damn, wash away the flim-flam
Knick-knack quick wack paddywack, give a dog a stick
Then hop off my dialect quick
to the throat I choke, I I need a Coke
cause I got somethin in my throat.. AHHA-AHEM!  Better?
Let no one get no one up gassed here
on the throttle catch a back of a forty bottle
Models can't roll put a toll into the parkin meter
Crowds around two kids in a four seater
Pack attack crunch from the boom
To give a brother ROOM, TO BREATHE, LEAVE

MC Serch,"Once upon a time ago, long before commercialized
Beats became sysnthesized and little girls were mezmerized
There was one mic and one light in a hip-hop shack
And you moved the masses or they moved you out the back
Slack with the skills and you'll never pay the bills
Buying up the brands with the octaginal frills
But when a brother flexed, we called him the Flexor
Beats were the melody, lyrics were the texture
Rhymes were webbed and the Serch light got stuck in
So follow for the record or keep keep on truckin'
Maybe you need the method of finding what the vibe is
Recollect the whole nine just like the Prince of Tides did
Playing what's funny with Muhammed, Tip, and Phife
It's keeping it alive, not a dive from the live
But the dead so selector rewind
To the scenes that are imprinted in my mind

	Recollect, the recollections, recollect
	The recollections, recollect
	The recollections, recollect
	The scenes from the mind

Swing with the groove that got you swinging from the rafters
808 state for the kids to the gafflers
Make an impact the community can check for
And if you're on the legend tip, nuff respect for
Coming back to the crew and not to every but T-shirt
Every lunchbox, wack record, don't give a damn
Fan club, yabba dabba doo dud
You can make the fattest record yo, and still be crud
Brothers want to keep you in the heart where the home is
Where the dome is and definitely where the microphone is
Serch knows the one light is bright and don't stench and
Don't bend, so friend, I'll send the flowers to
The funeral home of the hip-hop devoured by the
Mass appeal, you get the seal of removal
Not approval, cause only Woodsy Owl gives a hoot
So nice casket nice suit
Loot can be got for the long haul by the six recs
Down the road and you can still hit the long ball
Out of there, over there to the spectators in aisle nine
Who ain't heard Quest when they told them ""Check the Rhyme""
I ain't eating no green eggs and swine
I ain't eating no green eggs and swine
I ain't eating no green eggs and swine
As I recollect the scenes from my mind, flute time

	Recollect, the recollections, recollect
	The recollections, recollect
	The recollections, recollect
	The scenes from the mind    (Repeat 2x)

Back to the mic to the stand to the light
>From the globe to the lobe to the inner ear so all night
Different tracks can be heard in different arenas
For the clubs, the heads, the rides, the Beemers
Somebody starts checking for the fact Serch is long gone
So I rip clubs from LA to Strech Armstrong
Along the tribal road we lose parts too easily
So I say peace to Eric and Beasly
Bobbito and the '97 street crew
Sec Lover, my brother Honululu
Which and proper Tom is the call for the firm grips
Serch fixes his rhymes, shoots 'em on the sperm tip
Milky is the flow, I hope it stays protected
A&R gets respect for being more selective
Cause gone are the days of the deaf, dumb, and brain dead
And I close the book on the scenes from the head

Once again, this is your brain
This is your brain on drugs *egg starts frying*
This is your brain on social narcotics
Any questions?

Do you sell drugs (No) Do you carry drugs? (Never did)
But you ain't talking about the drugs inserted in the crib
Of the mind of the youth, young and trying to adapt
To the circles and hurdles and the craps, it's on map
Get the backslap and the ""Everything's all right"" lecture
Then in school BAM! sit 'em right next to
Mister David Duke, triple K white Aryan
Who tells you pops told him that you were the lesser man
Because of drugs that were put into the books
By the crooks of culture, the truth has a mother's looks
Who blesses and loves every single day
Words from Papa triple K and 66 right way
Take the troops here Mr. ""Only Way to Stop It""
I ain't checking for the crack, I'm worried about the social narcotics

How's he living kid (Foul!)
Spoon-feeding is deceiving because I need a fork
And if white people are superior I was delivered by the stork
Taught me that I was superior
Others are inferior, but what's important is the interior
Goddamn it, don't blame it on Janet
The nation got rhythm, but the rhythm ain't good
Not in my neighborhood
But will that change the devilish global way of thinking?
Homeboy, as fast as the eye starts blinking
But I'm just one man, one man one sister one brother one cousin
That helps another, to change change a place and change a pace

Yo social narcotics, a dangerous way of life
Talk to the young which will now deal with strife
Parents teaching their kids to be racist
So they grow up tricking, show hate to some faces
Inside the effects get me real vexed
Seeing people trying to flex case they got a color complex
Innocent children I see stay addicted
Getting high off of hate, that's why pain stays inflicted
To another color, it's a black and white fight
In Fatal's sight, that's why I gotta enlight
The blind minds of those that fell in this harsh reality
A social abuse that attacks the mentality
Cause race against race only brings friction
Pain and infliction, cause that's the addiction
Those that fall victim walk around headless
Cause the drug that they took made them an addict to prejudice

Convert to a Christian or become a slaveman
Indian brought the corn and the bread and in return
We gave 'em muskets to the head? Damn
Right back to the have-nots
Now in '92, lowered to be mascots

Hey ya
But soon after our rhyme is invented 
And put together, it sound contented
And rhymin a-fi work
I tell you rhymin, yes it a-fi work
Bang-dang-dilli-dilli-dilli
MC's, dem like to bite the things you say
Others come along and like the beats you play
You know that's cold considered a dissin of work, ya know?
I don't deal with negativity and thing and thing
I'm the MC, and I'm also cool
Jacuzzi in my crib size of your pool
Sent di butler for my midnight treat
Rug so plush ya can't see ya feet
If ya come and visit if you choose
It's a must at the door that you leave your shoes
Don't obey and you'll have to go
Some didn't listen till my gun went bo!

Rock the house a little bit
Rub-a-dub

Michigan and Smiley
And di Yellowman
And MC Shan and Marley
Ya know

The house is packed every place I play
But let me tell ya bout this jam one day

>From the very first time I walked through the door
I see the people rub-a-dubbin on the floor
Played the wall, a man came past
Oh my God, dem puttin fire to glass!
I dipped, I bobbed, I weaved, I shook
I hear ya pump it one time and from there you're hooked
It make you sell your car, your house, your ring
Have you flying through the clouds and you don't have wings!
He passed it to me, I said, ""No,"" him said, ""Why?""
My boy jumped up and said, ""I'll give it a try""
>From the very first time he ignited the flame
My homeboy wasn't actin insane
I tapped him on the shoulder and I said, ""Let's go""
He looked at me and replied with, ""No""
I said, ""Fuck it,"" and left him there
The torch, the pipe, the base, the chair
I came back five days from then
To my surprise I seen my friend
To let you know what this thing does
He was sitting in the very same spot he was
I walked over, ""Want more?"" he said
Pipin hot my man dropped dead
His head hit the table, the pipe hit the floor
But I'll mention that di man won't base no more!
Bo!

Hey man, let me tell ya, man
True story, no bloodclot
???? when his head hit the floor, man
Everyone cried for the coroner
Some picked up di pipe and said
""Man, dem leave em on the floor just like he lay, ya know?""
Picked up dem crumb and put it in di pipe and fuckin pissed off, ya dig, man
Oh my God, bloodclot!
Man puttin fire to di glass thing, man
And say, ""Scotty! Scotty! Where ya at, Scotty?""
To the transporter room, ya know?
""Beam me! Beam me!
Beam me, blood!

MC Shan,"(Jane, stop this crazy thing!) [x2]

She was this girl that I know named Jane
She used to be cool, now the girl's insane
Now all Jane does is walk around all day
Sayin, ""Beam me up, Scotty, take me away!""
Now I remember Jane from back in the day
When she used to go to school, get all straight A's
Now you see Jane on the street corner
Stoppin every car anytime she wanna
Whatever went wrong, the facts remain
But who could think this woulda happen to sweet old Jane

(Jane, stop this crazy thing!) [x2]

Jane's lifestory was a tragic one
She started gettin high, cause she said it was fun
There was no party, just a meeting of friends
And then the question arose: who got ends?
It went around, they had 300 in all
Somebody yelled out: ""We're gonna have a ball!""
Steve grabbed the money and ran down the block
Came back and said, ""Y'all, take a look at this rock!""
Jane was gettin into somethin heavy that night
""Hurry up quick, somebody give me a light!""
[Name] said ""Hold it!"", he was pullin too fast
But Jane was amused by the smoke in the glass
She was tickled to death at the faces they made
""Puttin fire to the glass, don't you think it won't break?""
In a flick of a flash the torch was lit
She put it to her mouth, and she took a hit
Smoke rushed from her lungs and up to her brain
This was the beginning of the end of Jane

(Jane, stop this crazy thing!) [x2]

Jane got weak, and the bass got strong
What she used to do right, Jane now does wrong
I walked past one day, called my man Jack
She almost broke her neck cause she thought I said ""crack""
It had to be a week since I seen her that day
But the body that she had just wasted away
When she used to walk by, we used to say she looked chill
But now as she passes, everybody go (ill!)
The girlie we saw hop off Mercedes Benz
She was on it so hard, she started stealin from friends
To all the drug dealers she was so in debt
That she sold her VCR and her TV set
Jane used to live the life as the storybook tells
Now everything she gets, she eventually sells
Sneak around the corner when you see Jane comin
She'll be touchin on your clothes, the girl be crumbin

(Jane, stop this crazy thing!) [x2]

If you know a girl who was the quiet type
Who acts kinda funny and a bit too hype
These kinda actions only mean one thing
She's only buggin like that cause she's suckin the thing
Not only the girls, it can happen to guys
But the fellas try to beat you, then they greet you with lies
One day Jane coulda been my honey
I just couldn't wait till the girl made 20
I see her nowadays, and all I do is sing
(Jane, stop this crazy thing!)

MC Shan,"[ INTRO: MC Shan ]
She used to tell me that she loved me all the time
I'd turn to her and say that, ""I'm
Infatuated by your lovely smile
And some day soon we're gonna walk the isle""
She'd say, ""You're my everything, my strength for life
Be the mother of your children, as well as your wife""
She used to tell me all the time, I'm her one and only
But she ran with another man and left me lonely

[ VERSE 1: MC Shan ]
Coincidental how I met her
But when I seen her I knew that I'd get her
Can't let her step, she look too good
But my wears made me seem like a stone cold hood
I'm a lucky guy, so I press my luck
I step to her, ah what the fuck
Went her way, took a few steps past her
Got the nerve, and then I asked her
I said, ""Yo baby,"" and she started to reach
I said, ""Whoa, don't get excited, that's a figure of speech""
She told me her name, gave her number and all
And when I stepped, she said I better call
It took about a month, but she was finally mine
Everything was going smooth, we were doin fine
After a while it wasn't no thing
We were either holding hands or she was under my wing
She used to whisper in my hear I'm her one and only
But she ran with another man and left me lonely

[ CHORUS: TJ Swan ]
Girl, why'd you have to leave me that way?
I love you to this day
And it hurts to think of the words you used to say
Girl, why'd you have to leave for so long?
I never did you wrong
And it seems we had such a love that was so strong

[ VERSE 2: MC Shan ]
On the day she broke out, would you believe I cried?
And it hurts so much to think of how she lied
I shared everything to the very last penny
Somethin that you really can't do with many
Since this young lady was such a big winner
I'd treat her all the time to a candle light dinner
Have a violinist play a real sweet song
And she never showed a sign that somethin was wrong
My boy used to say (Man Shan, I'd quit her)
But she seemed so happy everytime I'm with her
We used to hold hands and walk in the rain
And on the days I felt down she eased my pain
This was just too far-fetched to believe
To think that my girl would just up and leave
Imagine that - I just couldn't
Cause I knew deep down in my heart she wouldn't
All of a sudden a lot of things changed
She started actin funny, I mean a bit srange
We had little squabbles, arguments, fights
Wild stories in the days and stayed out nights
I'd say, ""Baby, where you been for all that time?
She cuddled me close and say that I'd
Be the one that she call her only
But she ran with another man and left me lonely

[ CHORUS: TJ Swan ]
Girl, why'd you have to leave me that way?
I love you to this day
And it hurts to think of the words you used to say

[ VERSE 3: MC Shan ]
She put it to me plain, couldn't put it no clearer
Lipstick written on the bedroom mirror
Said, 'I'm leaving you now, and I know that you'll miss me
You're probably saying: Damn, man, why she dissed me?
But you see, I felt that it was time to go
Then I packed my bags, and I'm leavin, so
You take care and I hope you live long
And don't worry, there's nothing that you did wrong
You'll find the right girl someday, you'll see
Why I'm the type of woman that must be free'
I said, ""Why me?"" and fell to the bed
Reached for the 9 and put it to my head
And thought about the words that she once said
(Shan, you know that you're my one and only)
But she ran with another man and left my lonely

[ OUTRO: TJ Swan ]
O-o-o-oh girl, oh my girl
Why'd you have to leave?
Leave me so sad
Girl, you broke my heart
Oh, you drive me wild
You leave me by myself
All by myself
Girl, I don't know what to do
I'm so mad
Girl, you drive me wild
Ooh so wild
Baby drive me crazy
Leave me by myself
Leave me all alone
By the phone
I don't know what to do
I'm so mad
Girl, you drive me wild
Oh so wild
When I saw you leave me
Makes me want to cry
Girl, I'm breakin down
Breakin down
Yo, I don't know what to do

There is no implication hip-hop is wrong
Beats tapped out, played back in songs
Consider hip-hop as a verbal sport
It brings pleasure while expressin one frame of thought
Those that don't like it, then you're psychotic
To my point of view hip-hop has got it
Rhymes being written everytime you blink
With no vital signs of becoming extinct
Try to demolish, it will not be worth
Killing all hip-hop fans on earth
Don't try to compare it, there's no relative
The word to describe hip-hop: creative
Once you're at a party you're in hip-hop's lair
To downgrade all, how could one dare?
Once upon a time they used to play soul
>From there they went to rock 'n roll
Rock died down, then along came pop

I am the creator of my hip-hop style
With a level of college understood by child
Hip-hop is being moved on a one-way course
Up and being led by an unseen force
You try to hold it down, won't be no good
The more it gets exposed, the more it gets understood
It's all fantasy, yet all realistic
Often complicated, other times simplistic
Lyrics so sharp, they can cut like a knife
I'm sworn by oath to the hip-hop life
Less live drums, less guitar strumming
Hip-hop is the life of the up and coming
Not by force, by want and choice
Persuaded by the beat and the MC voice
There are people who love it across the land
And there are those that think that it should be banned
Well I say I love it, it comes from my heart
Very thankful for the day that it got its start
Now that it got started, you see it won't stop
And you'll be livin in the world of hip-hop

Is take away my pen and my hip-hop pad
Take that away, I have nothing left
So let it go free or sentence me to death
I know you had troubles with your moms and dad
When you were growin up goin through your childhood bad
Some parents think that hip-hop means
Wearin fat shoe laces and name brand jeans
It really doesn't matter just what you say
Hip-hop will be around till you're old and grey
They're just all lies created by nerds
You think that I'm playin, you mark my words
Just like man sends rockets to Mars
Hip-hop living is ascending to stars
The more it gets accepted, you'll see it won't drop
And you'll be livin in the world of hip-hop

Runnin neck to neck in the music world race
You don't have to listen if it isn't your taste
It's becoming worldwide, internationally known
Have you ever heard the saying 'to each his own'?
People like jazz, cause that's their taste
I prefer crisp highs with an earthquake bass
There are hip-hop songs that make you tense
And then there are those not worth 2 cents
But still hip-hop's gonna make its mark
Cause you used to only hear it in your neighborhood park
To all non-believers, you should know your name
Since the parks, don't you see how far the hip-hop came?
It's been around for years, and you ask yourself how?
For the very same reason that you're listening now
You might have been hooked from the very first line
Cause raps like these cultivate one's mind
One day your resistance level might drop
And you'll admit: it's a world of hip-hop

[VERSE 1: MC Shan]
Where I come from, we never heard of bite
We can write the freshest rhymes at the speed of light
All my planet, we're the real McCoy
And it's you Earth MC's that I wish to destroy
When I rhyme I'm never out of place
I take you on a voyage to outer space
Every rap I make, you know it always sells
I fly the galaxy wearin laser Cazels
I can fly from place to place quicker than you can snap
I'm known as the space wizard of rap
Depend on how I feel, if it's only for fun
I take my mic off of 'kill' and I set it to 'stun'
Sometimes my rhymes do inflict pain
Sends electrical impulses through your brain
In your Earthling ears my rhymes are caught
Transmitted to your brain is what's known as thought
I can see the devastation as I look in your face
Listen to how the deejays rock up in space

[VERSE 2: MC Shan]
To call yourself MC, are you out of your mind?
You have to have a golden voice similar to mine
But when you have a jam that is cold set
You play the same old records, one right after the next
For you to win the battle, Earth will have no chance
With the spinning of two records, and you call that advanced?
To do that on my planet you'd be taking a risk
Because the beats we play out live, and that's not on a disc
The first time that they see it, they might be amazed
And say, ""Why should we commit ourselves to permanent waste?""
That's why it is impossible for us to lose
Plug in the microchip of any beat that we choose
One thing where Earth and my people might match
That is the similarity and sound of the scratch
We have stamina, and also have poise
The only difference is our scratch is no sonic noise
To take Earth MC's out is what I wish to achieve
Once this is accomplished I be destined to leave
When I leave they'll call me an ace
That cool MC from outer space

[VERSE 3: MC Shan]
Although my color just might be green
I'm the flyest space MC that you ever seen
It might be in your future cause it can't be your past
But the reign of Earth MC's don't have too long to last
All you fresh MC's, you should feel ashamed
The wack around the world, you put em down with the game
They get on the mic and be coppin a plead
About how good they rock on the m-i-c
On my planet you must take a test
I'm at the top of my class because I'm the best
I use my rhyming skills for what it is worth
That's why I'm here to battle all MC's of Earth
If you take me out which ain't been done before
You might just start a interplanetary war
The war won't be to kill John and Steven
The whole point of it is to get even
The war's to get even, I will say indeed
And I will come back every year till the day I succeed
I hope I didn't stand here and offend you too much
If you ever wanna battle, then get in touch
So I can come back and dis your face

They used to do it out in the park
Every place they said his name it rang an alarm
Otherwise known as Mean Teen Tom
A brother whose known for his rap
Jabby Jack, Larry Laughter and least not last
A cool brother by the name of Gas
These brothers made you get loose
They was down with a brother called Cousin Bruce
They used to jam in the center
You had to pay so you could enter
Go to the door
Get frisked
Just in order to get in
And if you wasn't from this town
Then you couldn't fight and win
But everytime they had a jam
They couldn't get no peace
So that's why the jam's out there
And the parks they had to cease cause you was in

Why don't you wise up
Show all the people in the place that you are bright

By stupid little things put inside your head
Or someone else that you will see
Their trying to live your destiny
By the time you think about it your grown
And then you gotta say god damn I gotta leave my home
Grab hold of your heavy chain
Rich people always pullin always trying to restrain
You heard just what I said
They're always pullin ya back when you want to get ahead
They pull you back cause their not wit it
You're talking about school
Their talking about quit it
Soon you'll see that time just fly
Cause you spent most of it out gettin high
Thought about it much, much later
Could've went to school and been much greater
But you chose to lead that fate
Now you're sucking on a bone when it should've been steak

",The Bridge [Bladerunners Dub]
MC Shan,"Come on y'all
Get down

It might've took a while
But you knew I had to hit you with a brand new funky rhyme
Guess you already know, so I'm ready to go
Marlon, hit me with the beat one time
Right now I'm gonna introduce myself
So y'all know just who I be
All you suckers in the house stay quiet as a mouse
Instead of Shan call me Mr. MC
I'm goin' back to the basics

When I was just a young boy, who ever would've thought
I'd grow up to be an MC
But my rhymes are so nice that they paid my price
Because fortune and fame ain't free
These words I'm recitin' are written in a style
That you ain't heard in a long time
And a song like this'll make a rapper reminisce
About the days when he was in his prime
I ain't never lost no battles yet
What made you think I would?
How many times does it take, all the rappers I break
And you still don't think I'm good
This girl in my class tried to move too fast
When she tried to pull down my zipper
Well, things got strange when the whole scene changed
And I all out tried to strip her
Teacher stepped in between, sent me straight to the Dean
That's where I thought my journey ended
Call your moms up to school, are you some fool?
And forget about bein' suspended
You went back to the basics

Here's the story on how I got started
Yes, way back in the day
With my man Infinite, Jazzy, Akim
And fly girl Roxanne Shanté
People used to hear that our crew was nice
But rappers just had to be convinced
And those who walked through 12th Street tried to say a rhyme
You seen or heard from em since
We sent em back to the basics

Yes yes y'all, it's like this y'all
MC Shan with a brand new twist y'all
One day when me and Marley Marl was playin' in a ditch
We made this jam that we knew would slam
And some day it would make us rich
Marley Marl had be thirty-six bass bottoms
And he cut you up on the spot
And with my rhymes combined all the papers got signed
And the be, be, be, be, Bridge got dropped
We went back to the basics",Back to the Basics
MC Shan,"(Cut it nice)

(Get ready to get busy)

[ VERSE 1 ]
It's been so long and I paid my dues
And with rhymes like these, yo, Shan can't lose
You won't believe the strange thought that occurred to me
So intense, it absolutely startled me
I knew that I was buggin when I stopped walkin:
""I think that you should hear me, I'm your conscience talkin
If you don't want to listen, hey, it ain't no thing
You rap for a living, but you wish you could sing
You think your life is complete, there's a lot that you're missing
You enjoy making music for the people to listen
Hip-hop is your life, by oath you've sworn
Now it's time to start the mission for which you were born
You've acquired a rep, now you're labelled a villain
But I don't really care, Shan'll always be chillin
That's why I'm tryin to say, that's just part of your style
You were (born to be) wild, wild""
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be)	--> Steppenwolf

(Cut it nice)

(Get ready to get busy)

[ VERSE 2 ]
I couldn't forget, no matter how I tried
But my conscience just wouldn't let a day go by
All day long I watched and observed
No, I gotta be jokin, that's word to Herb
I can take a lickin and keep on smilin
Who needs a license to ill, I was born to be wildin
Rhymes sweeter than a premium vintage grape
>From the paper I knew it'd sound dope on tape
Never in a rush, I'm Cold Chillin'
And the next perpetrator I find, I'm killin
Just ask your boys how many heads I flew
And that's why I roll with the Juice Crew
That voice in my mind taught me one lesson
I was born to be wild, and only suckers be fessin
I knew I had a purpose since the days of a child
I was (born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be)

(Cut it nice)

(Get ready to get busy)

[ VERSE 3 ]
The meaning of 'wild' is not screaming and yelling
It's 'bout showing and proving and not showing and telling
All you counterfeit rappers, you might as well quit
You'll never hear me say I'm bad, bein wild is the shit
Rap symbol, and never been defeated yet
If rap is a crime, how much time I get?
The best impersonator couldn't copy my style
And even if he did, you know what I'd do, I'll -
As a matter of fact, it's what I already did
I pulled out a rhyme and cold blasted his lip
Most opponents get on, they're guilty as tried
They're diggin and stripped of whole manhood and pride
Don't be brave and save yourself half of the bill
You can't chop me with a saw cause your ass should chill
When they're slippin on the cuts I gracefully smile
Cause I was (born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be)

(Cut it nice)

(Get ready to get busy)

[ VERSE 4 ]
Born to be wild, I'm takin command
While you're performin people screamin out: ""We want Shan!""
I'm colder than ice and hot as a flame
And my rhymes are always clever, but they're never the same
What's wrong with your girl? Somebody ought to stop her
For bein in the presence of a low-life rapper
This rhymin was pressed as a special edition
I was born to be wild and you're the one on a mission
Allow me to say that I weaken resistance
Makin examples just to prove my mortal existence
Born to be wild means a prototype
And the roar of the crowd increases the hype
You have to be bold to try and steal my rhyme
Or even to dis cause you think that I'm
A sucker, a softie, or even a child
But I was (born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be)

MC Shan,"I myself I'm called a hood because I walk with a limp
Would you believe they even call my boy a hip-hop pimp?
Like Dr. King I had a dream, I couldn't sleep too long
If I had to stand alone, I'd still be strong
Men are all equal, we're the Father's creation
What used to be the distand land is now my nation
How long will it be, how many suckers must die?
There's only one answer to the question why
My knowledge is the sun and it will always shine
You better go for yours, cause I'ma get mine

Unalikes attract and a-alikes repel
And if you buy dead dreams I got plenty to sell
All the money in the world couldn't buy my knowledge
My teacher was experience, the streets was college
It's a shame that many had to learn this way
So I never take the word of what the next man say
Head-a-arm-arm-a-leg-a-leg-a
Supreme High Being, Sole Controller, not a beggar
My true manifestation of Shan
I never fell, I held my destiny within my hand
On the day that I was born I received strike one
Because my culture was an Asiatic native son
My knowledge is the sun and it will always shine
You better go for yours, cause I'ma get mine

My foundation is strong, so I had to destroy
Do y'all remember Cheetah, that was Tarzan's boy
My main motto is self-satisfaction
Life's a movie with no cuts, all straight up action
If you roll as a sucker, then a sucker you die
And six feet up above you is the heavenly sky
I haven't heard of any comin back to tell
Dyin must be heaven, cause livin is hell
You sit around and wait for your wish to be granted
And the next thing you know you're being buried and planted
Your body is the temple, the brain is the center
A door to explore, but you're scared to enter
Mind means many in either direction
And the dictionary listed in the poverty section
You're nothin but a novel on a bookstore shelf
And see the title of mine reads 'Went for Self'
My knowledge is the sun and it will always shine
You better go for yours, cause I'ma get mine

You say you're sick and tired of bein rejected
And you think you do better bein crime-connected
Just for example let's say that you're twenty
Got a Benz, fly girls and doo-doo money
Moms ask: ""Where you get it?"" What you gonna tell her?
You dropped out of school, became a drug seller
You say you knew what you were doin, you say you were smart
Next week they beat you down and bust a cap in your heart
Your knowledge is the sun, you better let it shine
No matter what you do with yours, I'ma teach mine",Go for Yours ('Cause I'm Gonna Get Mine)
MC Shan,"The hip-hop sound went through stages
Embark on a trip as I flip through pages
This particular part 'bout a bridge on the Hudson
I first got hand by the rhymes and the cuts and
If I'm not mistaken makin two records mix
And certain deejays had a few dope tricks
If you asked to be on you would be their guest, y'all
Say a few 'ho's and a 'yes yes y'all'
They had battles of the neighborhood jocks
And I used to take the jam right straight to the box
Every now and then you'd hear gunshots ring
Just duck, what the fuck, yo, it ain't no thing
What I thought was shots was just a few pranksters
Were pow-pow-pow men juicin the gangsters
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
They used to do it out in the park
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark

This was a time MC's used to bug out
Yo, what happened? (Yo, somebody pulled the plug out)
Just about the time when you jumped for joy
(Yo, you take my stage, I'ma kill you, boy)
Answer back and gettin smacked and your friends made jokes
(Hey, pack it up and get out of the park, folks)
But only to the cops we made some commitment
I was shocked when the stick-up kids took the equipment
Say - what - is the message?
(Love is the message)
Say - what - is the message?
(Love is the message)
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park

In the winter time they moved the jams to the ????
Do you think that the cold made the whole thing cease?
I recall sein Flash one time - no, two
Can't forget about the Queensbridge Crew
For this is the place which I made my mark
And those who resist or try to dis get sparked
In the park after dark things really got cookin
I seen the titles of idols and many chains get tooken
I seen the scatter of pack, letter for letter
If you wasn't from the town they'd beat you down
But these are just pieces of the ancient ways
But the rule still applies to the rhymes nowadays
Just wave your hands in the air
And wave em like you just don't care
If you used to do it out in the park
Let me hear you say 'oh yeah!' (oh yeah!)
Oh yeah! (oh yeah!)

A time when..
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
They used to do it out in the park
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
They used to do it out in the park

Dead dreams - still bought and sold
I strive and I strive to receive my goal
I'm still not happy up until this day
But I'm chill and I don't care what nobody say
Livin and learnin about the straight up deal
And got by cause I went by just what I feel
Cause I refuse to be mislead
By puttin pipes to my lips and smoke in my head
Think about it, much, much later
Go to school and expand because knowledge is greater
But she chose to lead that fate
Eye to eye with a dick on a $5 date
The whole purpose of the story I told
Was mainly to inspire you to reach your goal
Stop walkin through life as if you were blind
You should reach for your goal cause I'm reachin for mine
They used to d-do it out in the park
D-do it out in the park
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
They used to do it out in the park
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
They used to do it out in the park
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park",They Used to Do It Out in the Park
MC Shan,"[ VERSE 1 ]
M.C. Shan's what I'm called, I stand tall and brave
And me and Marley Marl is as close as a shave
My rhymes lock jaw like a pitbull bite
Suckers always try to sleep on me cause I look light
See, a lotta wack rappers try to rack their brains
To feel a style of MC, come on, break these chains
Speak now or hold your peace when I decide to pass this
But every rhyme you ever had could never surpass this
If rhymes were food, the main source for livin
You would swear that every line of my rhyme was Thanksgiving
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I don't need em
Stop jockin me, boy - give me my freedom

[ VERSE 2 ]
I want to break away clean, I mean virtually spotless
And all year long I been schemin and plottin this
If beats were cakes, then my rhymes'd get frosted
This is '88 and I still ain't lost it
For all of those who still got a doubt in their mind
There ain't a rapper livin bad enough to take mine
There ain't no studio-illusion and no scratch-syncin
Stop - if that's what you're thinkin
Write rhymes simultaneously, say em in pairs
And I would hate to have a rapper proclaim they're theirs
Instead in comin in a limo, bring a casket and hearse
Before we speak we'll hear the preacher from the deacon first
We won't be gathered that day to unite no couple up
Marley, are we gettin this on tape? (Yup)
All you dirty low-down better slow down faster
Your technique isn't good enough to hang with the master
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I don't need em
Stop jockin me, boy
Jockin me, son
Jockin me, punk
Jockin me, kid
Give me my
Give me my
Give me my freedom

[ VERSE 3 ]
I'm the opposite of what you say a slob is
Dumpin suckers off is exactly what my job is
I'm feared like Napoleon and blessed like Buddah
You couldn't face me solo, you'd have to bring your crew to
Dump me off, I don't recollect the mumble
I ain't soft, homeboy, and picture me crumble
And forget all of those that don't like my rap
I don't be kickin that old shooby-dooby-doo-wop crap
Rappers often brag about their bitin deejay
But they can't do Marley nothin, no how, so hey
It's clear to the ear what I'm sayin, son
That's why we feel like slaves on the freedom run
And each and every time a wack rapper walks by me
His head starts singin: Come on and fly me...
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I don't need em
Stop jockin me, boy
Jockin me, son
Jockin me, punk
Jockin me, kid
Give me my freedom

[ VERSE 4 ]
We can do this like Brutus, I'm not mad, I'm pissed
This parade of mine I doubt that you can rain on this
You couldn't place my rhymes amongst mortal men
When I be rhymin on beats that set the hip-hop trend
I will always exist because I'm bein preserved
Don't agree to set me free, then you gotta be served
I earned a name amongst society as lyrically ill
But yet I'm loyal, see, cause Marley hooks the beat up still
There's no way that you could say there's a day I'd fess
Hamana-hamana-nothin, you can kill that mess
My rhymes are ruthless, no heart, and totally wretched
And if they was to fall down, then the beats would catch it
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I don't need em
Stop jockin me, boy
Jockin me, son
Jockin me, punk
Jockin me, kid
Give me my
Give me my
Give me my freedom

Give me my freedom or not
I DON'T GIVE A F-
You don't want to play this?
Suck my -
Fuck off, muthafuckas
You don't like this?
I don't give a fuck
Just gimme my muthafuckin freedom
Goddamn!",Give Me My Freedom
MC Shan,"Gangs usually roll as a savage pack
Once sworn in, there's no turnin back
Initiation, manhoods are tested
Do crime, you'll fail by becoming arrested
Get beat down the line, cautiously steppin
Always watchin your back with your hand on your weapon
You blink for a minute and get brutally beaten
Every time you diss the colors it will keep on repeatin
When you say you knew somebody that was a gang member
You can't say you know him, you can only remember
You have to live life all nervous and worried
But joinin a gang means you want to be buried
It's either that or jail cause there's no other place
And a mind is a terrible thing to waste

Just a walk on the block, they tell you it costs
Willingly pay - or be forced
Once your color is set you gotta be stern
A bad influence for the young that are eager to learn
The rules of a gang is fightin and killin
Did you ever stop to think that was blood you were spillin?
Duckin from the cops most the time
Because you live life devoted to crime
Gangs are mainly based on colors and races
Not everywhere, just in particular places
Hang on the corner or on the stoop
Fightin people lookin just like a terrorist group
Gangs give a rank at society level
Wear a tatoo skull with the mark of the devil
You have to live life all nervous and worried
But joinin a gang means you want to be buried
It's either that or jail cause there's no other place
And a mind is a terrible thing to waste

No turnin back [repeated]

Had many bad dreams, nights stayin awake
Joinin a gang was the fatal mistake
Just to fill your head with knowledge till your mind goes blank
And rumble with boys and dispose of the shank
GANG can be spelled with capital letters
Yo, while you're sweepin the streets, does it make you feel better?
Some gangs lack action, they're basically talk
Until their brains get scattered on the sidewalk
Your obligation is to serve as a marionette
And by society you're treated like a homeless pet
You want to live the life of crime doin negative things
When Al Capone died, so did gangster kings
To live the life of a gangster is all out of place
Because a mind is a terrible thing to waste

Gangs are always violent but jail is rough
You go a man and you may leave a cream puff
You say you do crime cause you're poverty stricken
And so is everybody that you're robbin and vickin
Gangs ain't gonna be around much longer
If 5 out of 10 become mentally stronger
My mother said bein in a gang ain't nothin
I didn't listen to her cause I thought she was bluffin
I thank her from my heart that she stayed on my case
Made sure my mind didn't just become another waste",A Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Waste

Je t'ai offert une symphonie de couleurs

Qu'elle avait rencontré dans une station de métro
Quand je les vois main dans la main fumant le même mégot
Je sens un pincement dans son cœur, mais elle n'ose dire un mot

Remets donc le film à l'envers, magnéto de la vie
Pour elle, faut-il l'admettre, des larmes ont coulé

Sa vie n'était faite que de bluff et de meufs

Vivant sur la gloire au lieu de vivre sur la qualité
En moins de quelques semaines il s'est pris pour une sommité

Au lieu d'en être fier c'est pour toi que j'ai le blues

Je m'aperçois qu'en fait tu jalouses ta bibliothèque
Mais rien ne sert de copier l'originalité
Si tu te modèles au modèle tu deviens pâte à modeler

Car imitation égale limitation

Ensuite il me dit qu'il pue, qu'il faudrait qu'il se baigne
J'lui dis ""jette-toi dans l'égout, t'arrives direct dans la Seine""
Il m'a fait bouge de là
Je continue mon trajet, j'arrive sur le boul'vard Barbès
Quand je vois un d'mes amis qui venait de Marrakech
Il me dit ""arwhah, arwhah, j't'achète des rap en dinars""
J'ai dit ""non je veux des dollars car on m'appelle Solaar""
Il m'a fait bouge de là
Alors j'ai bougé, j'ai dû m'en aller, partir, bifurquer
J'ai dû m'évader, j'ai dû m'enfuire, j'ai dû partir,
J'ai dû m'éclipser, j'ai dû me camoufler
J'ai dû disparaître, pour réapparaître

Was ist der Sinn des Lebens?
I'm Alltag bin ich nur Claude MC
Ich war gestreßt, sagte selten ich liebe dich,
Weil ich seit Methusalem von der Bühne träumte
Aber ich habe ein anderes Image
Do hast die Charaktere verwechselt. Schade.
Alles steht bei Umberto Eco
Ich brauche wahre Liebe. Jetzt und auf der Stelle.
Lima, Oscar, Victor, Echo.
Wahre Liebe. Jetzt und auf der Stelle.
Als Kind spielte ich Fußball
Sie war der Ball, leider gab es einen Torwart
Wenn ich reintraf, jubelte sie
Mit ihrem langen Kleid war sie einzigartig
Vielleicht war ich zu brav
Ich hätte sie abends auf dem Hügel streicheln sollen
Ich stamme vom gesitteten Menschen ab
Gab ihr nur einen Abschiedskuß, bevor sie umgezogen ist
Alle meine Freunde fanden das schön
Ich brauche wahre Liebe. Jetzt und auf der Stelle.
Lima. Oscar. Viktor. Echo.
Wahre Liebe. Jetzt und auf der Stelle.
Jetzt sieht man mich I'm Fernsehen
Ich bin bekannt, die Beziehungen sind verfälscht
Von der Moderne zum Mittelalter
Trotz meines Images bleibe ich vernünftig
Was ist der Sinn des Lebens?
Ist die schönste Schönheit nicht die einer Freundinn,
Frage ich mich oft. Umberto Eco. Notizbuch:
Die Seiten sprechen von Zeiten des Irrtums
Zu Hause betrachte ich die Wand
Bin reif genug, um sprechen zu dürfen
Claudia am Flow ohne Ego
Erwarte dich beim Helikopter. Jetzt und auf der Stelle.

Wahre Liebe. Jetzt und auf der Stelle.

Une caméra avance gros plan sur Dominique
Seule devant la glace elle ausculte son corps
Puis crie machinalement encore quelques efforts
Tous les régimes sur elle furent testés
Toutes les tentatives ont été des échecs complets
Mais elle persévère et pour plaire à son homme
Dominique a décidé de suivre la norme
Elle emmagasine, des magazines
Dans lesquels elle pense trouver le recours ultime
Maso, à l'assaut de ses formes rondelettes

Elle était occupée à couper du pécu
Car on lui piquait les fesses, une victime de la mode
Tel est son nom de code
Victime de la mode, tel est son nom de code

Lumière, scène 2, l'as de trèfle lui propose
Une toute nouvelle donne et en voici la cause
Tellement d'efforts et pour quels résultats ?
Elle perd de l'oseille au lieu de perdre du poids
Dominique, réplique, et très vite m'explique
Qu'elle veut être la réplique d'une créature de clip
Ainsi font font font les petites filles coquettes
Elle suivent un modèle qui leur fait perdre la tête
From London, Washington, Kingston, Sharengton ou Carcassonne
Quand le téléphone sonne elle nous répond sans cesse

Elle était occupée à couper du pécu
Car on lui piquait les fesses, une victime de la mode

Victime de la mode, tel est son nom de code

Donc en guise de conclusion
À l'analyse logique de cette situation
Le régime, le jogging, la liposuccion
Sont à tester mais il faut faire attention
Espérons que vous aurez compris
Les bases très claires de ce code de déontologie
Prendre ou perdre quelques kilos
L'essentiel est d’être vraiment bien dans sa peau
Ma tactique attaque toute éthique avec tact
Dominique pas de panique
Écoute bien ce funky beat
La quête de l'image la laisse dans le stress

And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother

And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Why did I wake up, with all my clothes off?
On someone's kitchen floor, this is so wrong

Trying to find that face I remember
And then I'll text her
And she'll come over 
And we'll undo last night on the sofa 
Did anybody see her
Before she slipped away? 
Someone could've stopped me 
Making a big mistake

And I would tell me to leave the party and take her back to mine
And if I argued, I'd punch myself out and I would take my place 
She'd be here right now instead of somewhere else today

I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Bell

Not into fashion but I love the clothes she wears,
Her tattoo's always hidden by her underwear.
She don't care.

I threw a house party and she came
Everyone asked me
Who the hell is she?

Said he saw you last night making out by the lake
With a guy he hates
He doesn't look at me the same way that you do
Said I look pretty cute but I don't got the grades
Seen the star on my foot and the way I behave
We're better off when daddys outta town

O baby you got nothing to prove
But if we decide to go doesn't mean he's gotta know
O baby you got nothing to lose
And we're better off when daddys not around

Doesn't give his consent
So now we can't afford
The perfect wedding you want gotta do it abroad
In a place you adore so
I got us on a plane to Hawaii
Where the weather is nice
And where we are alone
None of daddy's advice
Followed us here from home
It'll be chilled if we move outta town

O baby you got nothing to prove
But if we decide to go doesn't mean he's gotta know
O baby you got nothing to lose
And we're better off when daddys not around

I can't be around him and I've tried
I told him that I liked him but I lied
Find some way to make him change his mind

Your no longer mine,
And now you've left me I can't seem to get you off my mind.

Why am I now living on my own,
She keeps inviting people home,
All the time.
Why am I still paying for her to phone,
When all the luxury's she owns should be mine.

You shrug me off when I say hi
Treat me so bad despite how hard I try.

Goodbye to you been wasting all my time,
Your no longer mine,
And now you've left me I can't seem to get you off my mind.
That's when I realized,
You had me hypnotized (had me hypnotized).

Gonna be the one were writing lyrics for
We had something good together,
Did you think you were big and clever,
To throw me out in awful weather,
How do I forget you now.

Becomes part of the machine.

Always playing clean. 
He plays by intuition,

What makes him so good?' 

He ain't got no distractions 
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,

Under the stars and moonlight

Feels like he's getting older
Now and noticing how he's finding
Grey hairs left in the shower
Tattoos fade by the hour
And he can't understand these feelings
Why life is getting him down
He used to smile now he frowns
And cries inside
Its been this way for a while
And he can't seem to put things right

When life has been unkind
And you're losing your mind
Look in the mirror afraid of what you'll find
It feels like time's not on your side

He doesn't like to mention
Applying for his pension
So his children don't know he's heading
Into a mid-life crisis
He can't afford the prices for
The new kitchen floor he's buying
He's been a drunk all his life
Two kids, a dog and a wife
He doesn't know
And in the daytime he just sits and watches television shows

When life has been unkind
And you're losing your mind
Look in the mirror afraid of what you'll find
It feels like time's not on your side

Don't know why but somehow
The ones you love you hate now,
You feel down and blue
Look at what you've thrown away
They stood beside you all the way
Now its too late, its too late for you

And told me you loved me
But now that I find
That you've changed your mind
I'm lost the words

When I need you most

Coconut cream on coffee coloured thighs

Where castles are made of sand

She goes up and down in my heart
Turned into jelly beans
And I'm starting to believe that danger's never near
When Joanna is here

Gluteous Maximus like a fire fly
And that's why I'm a kissaphoboc

Foams the color of space

But she doesn't understand much
I love it when our hands touch
Knowing that I'm near

Achilles wears a necklace
And feeling I got reckless

If you see Kate
Tell her that I'm looking for her
Cause she's so fine

I saw her friend that was in line that day
And had to tell her how I felt about Kate
She said ""could've read your mind or stand in line,
I've seen her do this to men a thousand times""
She had a rep for spreadin all her love around
And everywhere she went Kate drew a crowd
""Don't bother me, that's what I said
Cause I can't seem to get that girl out of my head""

When the smoke cleared out of Gettysburg many a mother wept
For many a good boy died there, sure
And the air smelted just like death

Whose only worth is their father's name

And we spilled our blood in the battle's heat

I'm cool, but every now and then I get a urge to kill 

I'm takin lives for a great price, I'm the type 

to snap in heaven with a Mac-11 and rape Christ 

And I'm fast to put a cap in a fag chest 

The Big L smash stress, cause hell is my address 

I'm on some satanic shit, strictly, little kids 

be wakin up cryin, yellin, ""Mommy Big L is comin to get me!"" 

Chorus 2X 

[Big L] 

I keep a cutie with a soft booty, hoes be runnin up 

""Can I get your autograph L?"" No bitch, I'm off duty 

I'm breakin hottie hearts, niggaz drop when my shotty sparks 

It ain't no food in my fridge; just body parts 

I keep the gear fresh, I keep the braids rugged 

I never wear, rubbers bitch, if I get AIDS, fuck it! 

A beef with me, you better prevent it cause in a minute 

I'll jump out a tenant rented, and leave a nigga body dented 

And my swoll knob your main girl cold slobbed 

and gave a blow job to my whole mob, with no prob' 

Aiyyo crazy bitches slept with L 

Then they niggaz got mad and tried to step to L 

But I'm sicker than a nigga that's in special ed so I suggest 

you spread pretzelhead, 'fore I turn your white sweats to red

Who gon stop me? Fish scale for papi

Tented wit BB's, stash box got three keys
Puffin trees, lock on my knees for car jackin thieves

Be loungin like Luke be, wit wall to wall coochie
Uh, Gruffie, know your biggest dream is to fuck me
This willie sip the bubbly, homicide's be ugly
For the record, I'm connected across the borders
Meetin Bermuda blue waters on the celly givin orders

I rest my ebony grill up in Beverly Hills
Smokin Phills, listenin to Stephanie Mills
Lifestyles of the rich and famous, all on anus
I'm in the spotlight, who don't know what my name is
Life dangerous, police always puttin me through changes
But in my spare time, I be at the golf rangers
Gruff, blowin up wit Mr. Big Stuff
The hamster, soul on soul, we on a roll
Explodin, platinum hits, cop catchin fits
Got this rap shit lock like pitch
Niggas call it quits
For '96 and forever, I'mma get the cheddar
I keep it by the lever, sport my minks in cold weather
I'm well known, rockin icy jewel stones
They be shinin, like stars from the Twilight Zone
You know my major, 1-800 Sky Pager flavor
Colombian connection, Don P., honey sexin

Now who be that? Hundred dollar bills crispy
Versace suit, slightly out the blaze, handkerchief be
Gator Morty slidin through the party mad pissy
Champagne cooler filled wit Mo', Don, and Crysty
Eyes low from the Dutch and hydro
When bubbly get low, what the fuck we rhyme on
I'm univer-sal, gals love Herb's style
Every now and then, mix my herb wit tical
I run wit real niggas, who live life foul
My clan's off the hook, y'all soft and shook
Now look, we never talk, lives get took
Straight up crook, Gruff could never live by the book

Puff 'dro slow, bulletproof, vest and hat
On my waist, rest my gat, shut your trap
Threat the rap, watch yo, begets get yapped

Before the rap was on the map
Nigga, gettin freshin crack
Get them stacked, kept the mack, accept the fact
You see me, protect ya back
Throw you in the dope fiend, watch your neck go crack

Dums Dums, you know where the clique come from
flip bricks, goin' in on sticks for Lumpsomes
Harlem World baby, up in ya girl crazy

Six pusher, mackin' all these Hookers who took us

Kingpinnin', doin' my thing, grinnin'
stayed in the bing in prison
ripped this cat for a ring that glistened
pullin' off them stings like a tradition
stay schemin' like Latin Kings up in the system
move with wisdom, catch 'em with these duded that's gonna twist 'em

Yo, these slugs ain't got no name

I almost shot a dame who came to cop Cocaine
squeezed on the Oye
Two-Thousand Grams of raw Yay
took the bricks, wiped the prints off the doorway
Four-Four spray, connivin' like Keyser Soze
flippin' pies, robbin' them Spanish guys on broadway

Twirl ya backbone, get my mack on.
Get your Reebok money, send ya ass home.
Is Gruff a playa?  Nigga, ask Pretty Tone.
Flooded rolly lit, smooth goldy shit.
If I ever die, your Joe's gon' have a fit.
Herb be phat, linen down derby hat.
Gators bitin', minks and fur on me back.

Yeah, this is how we do, just make ya boo-ga-lu.
Harlem World, baby, and the LB crew.
Now we do, party till the sky turn blue.
Partyin', yeah, that's what we gon' do.

I'm creepin' uptown, and my mans ride wit 'em.
He got three Dutches in the ash tray, and Sal wit' 'em.
He gettin' blunted, so he wanted me to slide me.
Give me two tic, so we can get wild wit' him.
We on FDR Drive, doing ninety-five.
Smokin' trees, on the ways, Saturday Night Live.
Word is butters, plus they muthafuckin' pad is hot.
Smoke the weed, drink the liquor, so I said why not.
Peepin', ring the bell, as soon as we hit the spot.
Shorty open the door wit' the short and the knot,
Wit' the belly button showin', the L that slip.
Yo, I smell that shit, yo, I can tell that shit.
Soon as my man creep wit' shorty inside the room
I con', I continue to spark up my moon, 'cause...

[Chorus]

Aiyo, Gruff holdin', keep the bar rollin'.
Check me in VIP, gettin' love open.
The fellow wit' cream, gon' sell her a dream.
Gas luck, needs to get the hell in between.
Know what I mean?  Kick game, puff la green.
Everywhere Gruff go, shine like high beam.
Word up, ya know the ice burnt up.
Give me one minute, have your wife skirt up.
And all playa haters get they life hold up.
Undertaker might have to dig some dirt up.
Chocolate mack nigga, push an ack vigga.
Call it Don P., then go relax wit' her.

[Chorus x 2]",This Is How We Do
McGruff,"I'm the greatest rapper in the world, you who tryin' to kid, man?
I will slam dunk on your big man.
Been rappin' for years, crackin' them bears, the sound of platinum chairs.
Predict future cash and it's near, my speech is dittly.
I bust shots until the heat gets heavy.
Fuck bitches until the sheets get sweaty.
Beats and melodies, will make me blink.
I'll pull my shank out, and give a warrior's cry.
If you ain't down wit' my crew, all you die.
You can tell I'm real, by lookin' in the ball of my eye.
I will get some cream from it, one day, your baby, and my baby.
Can my some dough on Teem Summit.
Countin' the loot, fountain the youth, the young God.
Here's the inside thug, like a Marmashad.
Some want to have emotions and kill me.
Put the toast to my kidney, when I speak most of them feel me.
So, keep my name off ya breath.
'Fore my nigga, Gruff, take the chain off ya chest.
All guaranteeing, blaow, take the brain off ya neck.
Off the top of the dough, one shot and you'll blow.
Fuckin' wit' Panama P.I., guarantee I'll take ya outta ya zone.

Aiyo me and my nigga, Hais, ride, lay loose.
'Case ya try to play Zeus, got the tray deuce.
Hidin' right inside the bubble, face goose.
Not too quickly to make... to make news.
I'm a ace deuce, caught cases, I got Gotti and O.J. juice.
And my crew, you're very stackless, very cock now.
Phase of every Rocky, turn your caviar ass into, um,
Chicken teriyaki, Spanish nigga try to front on me.
I say papi, Rocky, wish he would of shot me.
'Cause I don't care if he frail or cock D.
When I got the glock, B can't stop me.
And no judicial system could affix me, try to lock me.
Over papes on mine, Mr. D.A., someone to lace ya dime.
And tell P.H. that the camera job, come on, that's a waste of mine.
'Cause I got my girl Curry, live in D.C.,
Work the spring court, you know for me, that just scary.
How Harlem nigga do, get in the building, bitch, hurry,
Before my girl see, back to top, so she can give me one on jury.
Says hung, got her sprung, she felt that I'm young.
Her little toy boy, make her lick my ass wit a tongue.
She's so smart, she's dumb, but I keep; tomorrow ain't promised.
Now I might need a one way flight to St. Thomas,
And at the same time I got a JAG fetish,
And who knows, I might have bad credit.
I can't borrow from niggas I ass betted.
Go to your girl, I pop my truck faster.
Don't make me Flex on you, ghetto style, like Funkmaster.

[Chorus]
You got money, what it look like?
You got crack, what it cook like?
You got a song, what the hook like?
Word is bond, when P.I. hit the microphone, niggas took mics.
You got crack, what it cook like?
You got a song, what the hook like?
You got some money, what it look like?
What part of the game is that?
You fuck around wit' my track, blaow, part of the flaming stat.

I live the God knowledge, my book of life, he read like twice.
Five percent shine, today the grease like, my attribute's like.
Paretic chrome, I thrown, throw it at your dome, blown.
It be known, like Sa Salasi clone, connect wit' one zone.
Cybernetic, verbal buck slang, king ebonic.
Nickname: Farad, all of ya dude, rock me Muhammad.
I came swift, wit' off as the shit, they couldn't catch it.
Define this, got drawn so swift, couldn't detect it.
Thug covert, sip Scotch drink, just like an Irish.
Move like the infamous, full blown, antivirus.
Apollus, mad Olympic, fragile fitness.
Supreme gymnast, ancient decent, homey scriptures.
Equilibrium, catch me at the Wimbledon, thug gentlemen.
Guess jeans, Wu shirts, construction Timberland.
You're nobody wit' nothing, and your name shall be Nathan.
Who you facin?  Slugs blazin' the amazin'.

Aiyo check it, I used to live reckless,
Snatch kids necklace, nigga, respect this.
A nigga catch this, blaow, trigga specialist.
Is your death wish, leave you rib and chestless.
Gun ho, real life thug, every one know.
From the Bumjo, to the kids, to Colombo.
My niggas locked down doin' state, did you rumble?
Twenty-five to L, on the humble, real thug shit.
Plug shit, catch you, wouldn't dare fuck wit'.
Care rugged, from the skulls down to the Timb's.
Surroundin' your Benz, wit' niggas houndin' your gems.
Yo, pump this jam in your joint.
All my thug niggas cruisin' wit' the mamas on points.
City wise guys, gritty high guys, pretty mamas.
I even make boricua, shake the titty tatas.
Harlem World slugger, watch it explode like Pearl Harbor.
Screw ma, get a girl's Vodka,
And get them hotter, slide 'em off, twist 'em proper.
Yo, I'm a sex fiend, fuckin' in my four hundred Lex' ring.
Flex cream, presidential rolly wit' gets gleam.

Matter front, far screamin almost lost my voice

All up in your grill, is if you was famous

Nails all done, sportin Muskina on her body
She 5'3"", straight out the NYC
Tellin me, this other cute girl's Gruff, gon make you try me
Now check me, listen up, first of all, you're sexy
And not like them gold diggin chickens try to peck me
I see through them hoes, they can't get no new clothes
Askin for blue Parasukos, expensive shoe stores
Just for 'cause I'm young and hold figgas
Gold diggas try to gas me, they better gas them other niggas
'cause I ain't give them a cent, picture Gruff money bein spent
Payin some pigeon head rent

Don't start flaggin, whites and Arabs ain't right
Hop in the 6 double 0, don't front, let's go

Yo you drive, I'mma play the passenger side

McGruff,"Verse 1:
I was born a poor black kid, Pops doin' a bid
ran down tenement, barely no food in the fridge
My Moms dukes had to raise my on her own
all alone, never had a Father home
I remember clear as day seein' my Mother pray
hopin' I don't be like my Pops and go the other way
but you get tired of your pockets bein' empty
gear skimpy, yo the peer pressure tempt me
at Thirteen had to get my by all means
sellin' to fiends, Pops up State raisin' Hell in the Greens
fuck that, I'm'a hustle, I can't see my Momma struggle
in these Harlem streets drama loves you.

Verse 2:
Never was a stray A student
always played hookie, gettin' buddhad
dropped out of High school, the streets raised me
runnin' 'round holdin' heat crazy
My Pops played me, left when I was a Baby
perhaps he hate me, why the Mothafucka make me?
why the Hell is life like this? Trife like this?
sometimes I want to slice my wrist
found out I had a gift and thought twice 'bout shit
now I'm changin', whole like re-arrangin'
left the crack game'n for the rap game'n
ain't exactly where I want to be but I ain't complainin'

and I ain't tryin' to be there, I got mouths to feed
love my seeds, look just like me
dress like me, gotta be the best like me

Nowhere is there warmth to be found

Never with a herd
Prettiest mare I've ever seen
You'll have to take my word

I'm going to catch that horse if I can
And when I do I'll give her my brand

Well I was up on Stony Ridge
After this chestnut mare, been chasing her for weeks
Oh I'd catch a glimpse of her every once in a while
Taking her meal, bathing, fine lady
This one day I happen to be real close to her 
And I saw her standing over there
So I snuck up on her nice and easy
Got my rope out
And I flung it in the air!

I'm going to catch that horse if I can
And when I do I'll give her my brand
And we'll be friends for life
She'll be just like a wife
I'm going to catch that horse if I can

And I got her and I'm pulling on her
And she's pulling back like this mule going up a ladder
And I take a choice and I jump right up on her
Damned if I don't land right on top of her
And she takes off, running up onto the ridge 
Higher than I've ever been before
She's running along just fine
'Til she stops and something spooked her
It's a sidewinder, all coiled and ready to strike
She doesn't know what to do for a second
But then, she jumps off the edge, me holding on

Above the hills, higher than eagles were gliding
Suspended in the sky
Over the hill
Straight for the sun we were riding
My eyes were filled with light
Behind those black walls
Below was a bottomless canyon
Floating with no sound
Ghosts far below 
Seemed to be suddenly rising
Exploding all around

I'm going to catch that horse if I can
And when I do I'll give her my brand
And we'll be friends for life
She'll be just like a wife
I'm going to catch that horse if I can

We were falling 
Down this crevice 
About about a mile down it seem
And I looked down 
And I see this red thing below us coming up real fast
And it's our reflection that's 
This little pool of water about six feet wide and one foot deep
And we're falling down right through it
We hit, we splashed it dry
That's when I lost my hold 
And she got away
But I'm gonna try and get her again some day

I'm going to catch that horse if I can
And when I do I'll give her my brand

And then realized it was still dark outside
It was a light coming down from the sky
I don't know who or why

Must be those strangers that come every night
Those saucer shaped lights put people uptight
Leave blue green footprints that glow in the dark
I hope they get home all right

Won't you please take me along
I won't do anything wrong
Hey, Mr. Spaceman
Won't you please take me along for a ride

Woke up this morning, I was feeling quite weird
Had flies in my beard, my toothpaste was smeared
Over my window, they'd written my name
Said, So long, we'll see you again

McKendree Spring,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now

A dream lover will come my way
A girl to hold in my arms
And know the magic of her charms

With a love, oh, so true
And the hand that I can hold
To feel you near as I grow old

My own

I hope she'll hear my plea
Some way, I don't know how
She'll bring her love to me

I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Till all my lover's dreams come true

McKinley Mitchell,"I went running to the end of a rainbow
Looking for a treasure they said I would find
I found nothing but heartaches and troubles
I'm about to lose my mind

On the way, the load got heavy
And the burdens got hard to bear
None of my friends was there to help me
Left me standing in the middle of nowhere

With a heart full of pain, I was lost
So blind I couldn't see a thing
I couldn't even remember my name
They talked loud and clear

Every word, my ears could hear
In my heart was heavy
I couldn't even move
I just stood there like a silly fool

I believe, I'm going, back home
To start all over again
Left my rainbow behind me
Right where I, I began

Going, going, going, going home
I'm going home
(I'm going home to the end of the rainbow)
I'm going home
(I'm going home to the end of the rainbow)
Going, going, going, going home
I'm going home

Going, going, going, going home
