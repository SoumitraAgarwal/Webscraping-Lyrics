Pentagram,"What thought are running through your young head
Honey don't you wish I was dead I know you do
You're gunna learn 'cause I'm your main source
I ain't no measured mile I can make you run my course

You better act sweet don't 'cha treat me like dirt
You're 'bout to get it darlin' for all that you're worth
If I have to scream 'till my voice gets hoarse
I'll take no back talk lord! you'll run my course

And in the night I'll make you suffer
All your days are gunna rain
When you think You've felt the misery
I'll make you lonely just the same

You better act sweet don't 'cha treat me like dirt
You're 'bout to get it darlin' for all that you're worth
If I have to scream 'till my voice gets hoarse
I'll take no back talk lord! you'll run my course",Run My Course
Pentagram,"A lone soul at night sits and bays at the moon
Though sometimes he's a man it's a Pentagram
Shogun blasts as he runs with the wind
But he just can't win it's the Pentagram

And now don't know how but it's happening to me
Got the love from above but it's happening to me

Black cloud hang and it just won't leave
Though be tries to believe it's a Pentagram
Hard to conceive and he wants to perceive
But he's destined to grieve it's the Pentagram

Now don't know but it's happening to me
Got the love from above but it's happening to me

I can't turn back now

Stories unfold but they've all been told
When he sold his soul to the Pentagram
And to end his life though the silver is old
He will reach his goal by the Pentagram

And now don't know how but it's happening to me
Got the love from above but it's happening to me

Tell me one more time
It's alright
I can't turn back now
Cause it's the sign of the wolf

Pentagram,"You've been telling lies that I can see
Fairy tales that build inside of me
You keep tellin me
It's time we both see
You're lost yes, I'm free

You've been running wild, but not for me
I feel just like a child that cannot see
Your voice waking me
Saying I should see
You're lost, well I'm free

Fade away; I think that somethin' strange is wrong
I try to see, but still I feel, you are gone
I think I should see

Is there any way to out of this nightmare?
Baby, I'm alone now
And you're laughing at me
But I take life
In a way that you could never see
So if you're leaving
You better let me know
'Cause I've already started my plan
And I'm never gonna let you go

And I've been to the heart of the sun

Troygt the corners of the wood
Times you lived your life

Bleddin from it's vains of nails
Lived the pain that never ends
The tree of death

Since you were from the dirth
And raised too high
Of what life is worth

When you ease your brain
See your dreams over
Fence your eager to fly forever

Reaching trough the gun
Role the trigger run
That's no reason to fly
Forever fly

Few minutes of fallin drops
To dry the streams of your blood
You leave your god

As the mountain on which I close my eyes
To embrace the future of my last

Diggin your own grave,
Do you think you're brave?

I rule you blind
I read your mind
I can hear you cry,when your fly!
Over, Over the line

You better pray before you die!

Closer to his death
You're ready for your last walk alone!

Clouds of nuclear remnants and acid are still
Raining by that destroying forests and all living
Beings the human race is vanishing and the same
Is the world... god save us ... please...

People dig eachothers graves peace disappears from coast to coast
Traces of nuclear remain will lead the way to our racers dissolution

send in course to end it all
Locked to it's target secret missile
Send in course

Disarmamed fakes everyone soon we will end up dead
Annihilated is the embrio prematurial death of a week existence
Technologital shelter saver a few from this mess

Becomes primitive and mentally moulded soon urged by brutal instnct
Misantropy end vengeance a cause by this war that've been
If this beings have a change to live they'll live in artificialition
The trenches are full with corpses cheated innocent bodies lie

Mangled organs in minefields the battle was to die
The vanishing of our planet, you may hear the cries
With those insatiables leading us we won't die by our wanted fate
Surreptitious suspicious plans destroyed my life in hate

I turned my face and looked back to mother earth in sorrow
Said it was a mistake to start a war there'll be nothing left tomorrow

Many other rich junk feeding

As she was riding over the plain

she said stop
""Stand and deliver, come sir,'' she said
""And If an you do not, and if an you do not, I'll shoot you dead''

He delivered up his golden store
And still she craved for one thing more
""That diamond ring, that diamond ring that I see you wear
Oh hand it over, oh hand it over, and your life I'll spare''

""That diamond ring I wouldn't part
For it's a token from me sweetheart
You shoot and be damned you rogue"" said he
""And you'll be hanged and you'll be hanged for murdering me''

Young Sophie and her love were seen
He spied his watch hanging by her clothes
Which made him blush lads, which made him blush lads like any rose

Twas I who robbed you all on the plain
So here's your gold, so here's your gold and your watch again''

How John Lewis did murder poor little Omie Wise. 
He told her to meet him at Adams's Springs.
He promised her money and other fine things. 

And, fool-like she met him at Adams's Springs.
But no money he brought her nor other fine things. 
""Go with me, little Omie, and away we will go.
We'll go and get married and no one will know."" 

She jumped up behind him and away they did go,
But down to the river where deep waters flow. 
""John Lewis, John Lewis, want you tell to me your mind?
Do you intend to marry me or leave me behind?"" 

""Little Omie, little Omie, I'll tell to you my mind.
My mind is to drown you and leave you behind."" 
""Have mercy on my baby and spare me my life,
I'll go home as a beggar and never be your wife."" 

He hugged her and kissed her and turned her around,
Then pushed her in deep waters where he knew that she would drown. 
Then he got on his pony and away he did ride,
As the screams of little Omie went down by his side. 

T'was on a Thursday morning, the rain was pouring down,
When the people searched for Omie but she could not be found. 
Then two boys went a-fishin' one fine summer day,
And saw little Omie's body go floating away. 

They threw their net around her and drew her to the bank.
Her clothes all wet and muddy, they laid her on a plank. 
And they call for John Lewis to come to that place --
And brought her out before him so that he can see her face. 

He made no confession but they carried him to jail,
No friends or relations would go on his bail.",Omie Wise

She gave me trouble all my life
She ran me out in the cold rain and snow
Rain and snow, rain and snow
She ran me out in the cold rain and snow
She came a running on down the stairs
Combing back her long yellow hair
And her cheeks were as red as a rose
As a rose, as a rose
And her cheeks were as red as a rose
Well I ain't got no use for your red apple juice
And I'm not gonna be treated this a way

Pentangle,"The trees they grow high and the leaves they do grow green
Many is the time my true love I've seen
Many an hour I've watched him all alone
He's young but he's daily growing

Father, dear father, you've done me great wrong
You have married me to a boy who is too young
I'm twice twelve and he is but fourteen
He's young but he's daily growing

Daughter, dear daughter, I've done you no wrong
I've married you to a great Lord's son
He'll be a man to you when I am dead and gone
He's young, but he's daily growing

Father, dear father, if you see fit
We'll send my love to college for one year yet
Tie blue ribbons all around his head
To let the ladies know that he's married

One day I was looking over my father's castle wall
Saw all the boys aplaying with the ball
My own true love was the flower of them all
He's young, but he's daily growing

At the age of fourteen he was a married man
Age of fifteen the father of a son
Age of sixteen on his grave the grass was green
Cruel death had put an end to his growing

I'll make my love a shroud at the hole in so fine
Every stitch I put in it, the tears come trickling down
Once I had a true love but not narrow one
But I'll watch out his son 'cause he's growing

",The Trees They Do Grow High
Pentangle,"Well I once could have married the king's third son
And a fine young man was he
But now I'm married to a house carpenter
And a nice young man is he1

And a-go along with a me
I will take you to where the grass grows green
On the banks of the River Dee.""

""What will you have to maintain me upon
To keep me from slavery?""2
""Well I have seven ships
They will soon be at land
And they at your command shall be.""

She took her two babes by the hand
And gave them kisses three
""Sit still at home you darling little babes,
Keep your father sweet company.""

Now she dressed herself in her very best
Like a high-born lady was she
She shimmered and she shivered3 and she proudly stepped
As they walked by the banks of the sea

Well she hadn't been gone but a short, short time
Until she wept for sor'4)
""I would give all the gold in this round world
Just to see my babes once more.""

Well if you had all the gold and the silver too
That ever did cross the sea
You never would be at land anymore
And your babes you will never more see

Well they hadn't been sailing but a short, short time
About two weeks, three or four
When the ship sprang a leak and they were doomed
And they were far away from the shore

""I see bright hills of Heaven my dear
Where angels come and go
I see bright hills, that's Hell my dear
Where you and I must go.""

""Oh I wish I was back to my house carpenter
I'm sure he would treat me well
But here I am in the raging sea
And my soul is bound for Hell.""

Pentangle,"There lived a lady by the North Sea shore
(Lay the bent to the bonnie broom)
Two daughters were the babes she bore
(Fa la la la la la la la la la)

alternating with each of the lines below>

As one grew bright as is the sun,
So coal black grew the elder one.

A knight came riding to the lady's door,
He'd travelled far to be their wooer.

He courted one with gloves and rings,
But he loved the other above all things.

Oh sister will you go with me
To watch the ships sail on the sea?

She took her sister by the hand
And led her down to the North Sea strand.

And as they stood on the windy shore
The dark girl threw her sister o'er.

Sometimes she sank, sometimes she swam,
Crying, ""Sister, reach to me your hand!

""Oh Sister, Sister, let me live,
And all that's mine I'll surely give.""

""(It's) your own true love that I'll have and more,
But thou shalt never come ashore.""

And there she floated like a swan,
The salt sea bore her body on.

Two minstrels walked along the strand
And saw the maiden float to land.

They made a harp of her breastbone,
Whose sound would melt a heart of stone.

They took three locks of her yellow hair,
And with them strung the harp so rare.

They went into her father's hall
To play the harp before them all,

But when they laid it on a stone
The harp began to play alone.

The first string sang a doleful sound:
""The bride her younger sister drowned.""

The second string as that they tried,
In terror sits the black-haired bride.

The third string sang beneath their bow,
""And surely now her tears will flow

My mother won't mind
And my father won't slight you
For your lack of kind
She stepped away from me
And this she did say,
""It will not be long love
Till our wedding day""

She stepped away from me
And she moved through the fair
And fondly I watched her move here
And move there
And she went her way homeward
With one star awake,
As the swan in the evening
Moved over the lake

Last night she came to me,
My young love came in
So softly she entered,
That her feet made no din
And she came close beside me
And this she did say,
""It will not be long love
Till our wedding day""",She Moved Through the Fair
Pentangle,"As I did travel all on a journey
Over the wayside and under a dark moon
Hanging above a mountain

I spied a young man riding a fine horse
Chasing a white hart and all through the woodland
Head of a hunting party

And there followed after ten kings and queens
Laughing and joking, the white hart they'd seen
Bloodied running into the bushes

I plume to his helmet, a quiver and a bow
There's nowhere to run now, there's no place to go
The hunt is cast and ready

Still farther I journeyed through the hills and the valleys
Until upon the verge of despair I sat and rested
And there did pass a princely knight poursuite [pursued] by a lady
And this she did say:

""Oh may I ask you kind sir where you are going?
And pray tell unto me sir why you do hurry
Strange that I should meet you here, come sit by me"".

""I have here a magic horn to deliver
And one drop from this silver and gold horn I hold, sir
Shall prove all to be false, lovers beware!""

""The gift that you bear for your brother the king
I gladly would carry to the banquet this even'
What fair sport this would be for the maidens at court.""

Wearily I crossed the stream to the castle
Where I found shelter from the cold wintry wind
And food did I have and plenty
But the Lord and Lady seemed so sad
For these words they did say unto each other:

""My good lord, all off to war in thy armor
Leaving me here alone to weep and to worry
Take care lest misadventure
Shall overcome thy kindly heart
My good lord, all off to war in thy armor.""

""My lady, you have no need for to worry
I'll return victorious and true unto thee
Take care, lest misadventure
Shall stain your heart and lead to woe
My fair lady you have no need for to worry.""

. . . la la la . . .

While underneath the spreading oak a knight with white device
Upon a shield of black, and deep in grief and sorrow sings
His unrequited love

""Young noblewoman riding by, pray tell me have you seen
Queen Azelda the fairest maid, in company she rides
For I swear to have revenge.""

A thousand days have come and passed, the Lord returns this night
The victor from the bloody wars proven his fearsome might
As ever he would claim

But fate has played its wanton game, the circle come full turn
The magic horn has done its work, cried ""Falseness is found out!""
The sorrowed quest is over.

",Hunting Song
Pentangle,"In Bruton town there lived a farmer
Who had two sons and one daughter dear. 

One told his secrets to no other,
but to his brother this he said,
""I think our servant courts our sister,
I think they have a mind to wed.
I'll put an end to all their courtship,
I'll send him silent to his grave."" 

A day of hunting was prepared,
Where only bush and briars grew.
And there they did this young man murder,
And in the brake his body threw. 

""Now welcome home, my dear young brothers,
Our serving man, is he behind?""
""We've left him where we've been a-hunting,
""We've left him where no man can find."" 

As she lay dreaming on her pillow,
She thought she saw her own true love;
She dreamt she saw him standing by her,
She saw his coat was red with blood. 

""Don't weep for me, my dearest jewel,
Don't weep for me nor care nor pine,
For your two brothers killed me cruel-
In such a place you may me find. 

""Rise up, my love, tomorrow morning,
Go straightway to that brake you know,
For there you'll find my body lying,
Where only bush and briars grow."" 

She went out early in the morning,
And in the garden brake she stood
And there she found her own dear jewel,
All covered o'er in a gore of blood. 

She took a kerchief from her pocket,
And wiped his eyes though he was blind.
""Because he was my own true lover,
My own true love and a friend of mine."" 

Three days and nights she did sit by him,
And her poor heart was filled with woe,
Till cruel hunger crept upon her,
And home she was obliged to go.

Swinging in my hammock I fell asleep
I dreamed a dream and I thought it true
Concerning Franklin and his gallant crew

With one hundred seamen he sailed away
To the frozen ocean in the month of May
To seek a passage around the pole
Where we poor seamen do sometimes go

Through cruel hardships they mainly strove
Their ship on mountains of ice was drove
Only the Eskimo with his skin canoe
Was the only one that ever came through

In Baffin's Bay where the whale fish blow

The fate of Franklin no tongue can tell

I won the goodwill of my master and did I
Till a sailor came there one night to lay
And that was the beginning of my misery

He called for a candle to light him to bed
And likewise a silk handkerchief to tie up his head
To tie up his head as sailors will do
And he said my pretty Polly will you come too

Now this maid being young and foolish she thought it no harm
For to lie into bed to keep herself warm
And what was done there I will never disclose
But I wish that short night had been seven long years

Next morning this sailor so early arose
And into my apron three guineas did throw
Saying take this I will give and more I will do
If you'll be my Polly wherever I go

Now if it's a boy he will fight for the king
And if it's a girl she will wear a gold ring
She will wear a gold ring and a dress all aflame

Pentangle,"There lived a lady by the North Sea shore
(Lay the bent to the bonnie broom)
Two daughters were the babes she bore
(Fa la la la la la la la la la)
alternating with each of the lines below>
As one grew bright as is the sun,
So coal black grew the elder one.
A knight came riding to the lady's door,
He'd traveled far to be their wooer.
He courted one with gloves and rings,
But he loved the other above all things.
Oh sister will you go with me
To watch the ships sail on the sea?
She took her sister by the hand
And led her down to the North Sea strand.
And as they stood on the windy shore
The dark girl threw her sister o'er.
Sometimes she sank, sometimes she swam,
Crying, ""Sister, reach to me your hand!
""Oh Sister, Sister, let me live,
And all that's mine I'll surely give.""
""(It's) your own true love that I'll have and more,
But thou shalt never come ashore.""
And there she floated like a swan,
The salt sea bore her body on.
Two minstrels walked along the strand
And saw the maiden float to land.
They made a harp of her breastbone,
Whose sound would melt a heart of stone.
They took three locks of her yellow hair,
And with them strung the harp so rare.
They went into her father's hall
To play the harp before them all,
But when they laid it on a stone
The harp began to play alone.
The first string sang a doleful sound:
""The bride her younger sister drowned.""
The second string as that they tried,
In terror sits the black-haired bride.
The third string sang beneath their bow,
""And surely now her tears will flow.""",Cruel Sister [Live]

Pentatonix,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You, you enchant me even when you're not around
If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down

When you hiss and preach
About your new messiah 'cause your theories catch fire

I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace

Pentatonix,"The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, Heaven knows I've tried
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know
Let it go, let it go
Can't hold me back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free
Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I stay
Let the storm rage on
My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past
Let it go, let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day

There's a happy feeling
Nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffee
And the pumpkin pie

We're [?] our way on maps of stars
Hold on tight to fragile hearts
And keep our friends forever by our side

We could be kings of the world
On top of the nation
It's a celebration of the moments to come
The city's on fire
We're holding up lighters
Raising them higher and we've only begun

Take me all the way
Hear me when I say
Let's kiss the past away
Like New Year's Day
Take me all the way
Hear me when I say
It's time to celebrate
Like New Year's Day

Morning breaks, take my hand
Wide awake with arms wide open
Catch your breath, walk this way
No regrets on New Year's Day
Morning breaks, take my hand (kings of the world, top of the nation)
Wide awake with arms wide open (it's a celebration of the moments to come)
Catch your breath, walk this way (city's on fire, holding up lighters)
No regrets on New Year's Day (raising them higher, we've only begun)

Whether I've been a good girl or not
Santa promised he won't get mad

I missed my curfew by an hour late
I fed the dog the veggies off of my plate
Tried my best to obey mom and dad

Or maybe, just maybe you'll go easy on me

Snuck out the house and didn't act my best

Leave this frozen and overcrowded town,
And catch the first train,
Not knowing its destination.
I 'm gazing at people
Each of them, those lifeless things,
As I travel through the
Moody and rainy autumn night.

Metal grates on metal,
The shrilly scream of the
Brakes wake me. People get down,
Staring at me strangely,
I glare at them
And they hasten out,

I can feel vibrations running through my body
As the machine starts again...
All alone in the car,
The last station is near,
I find it empty,
I'm alone with the night.
Guided by the echoes
Of melancholia,
I'm walking up the dimly lit path.

I'm swallowed by the cool
And obscure night,
The wild and cold surroundings
Graze my skin.
Excited by my senses,
I run towards a glade.
Trees in the moonlight thow
Bars upon the ground.

Above me, the full moon is shining
And I shoot a sharp look at it.
My eyes are crying,
How could I resist it?

Utters a long howl.

And find a fresh plate to rotate to make the be	-boys get aches

Cause once we step up in the party, yo we make the ladies shout

Packed up my records, rolled up the blunt

I got out the black book, tried to call up this stunt
She wasn't home, so I paged her, left the celly on roam
And we out to the night, right on Pico
Rolled down the street, stopped at the red light

Kept on going, made a right on Sierra Bonita,
Yo Thes, where's your fake ID? Ya know we need a
Little bit of liquor for the night

So I kept on walkin, couldn't waste no time
Bumped into this white guy that I knew
He offered me a brew, I was like fuck it
Took it to the head, now I'm through
So he laughed, rolled another one up
This fool Thes is pushin it, puttin gin in my cup
Now I'm toked back, can't walk worth shit
He lamp lit the J and I hit that shit
Took about a hundred pulls, at least that's how it felt
Chillin with my boy, at least that's how it felt
Realized I was buggin then I saw Mike's pops
When I decide to spark the beedie and relaxed at the spot
Yo, to the DJ, throw on 2Pac
I walked back in and showed the stamp, felt like I was shot
Oh my God!  Saw this brown skinned cutie
With a big booty, titties big as hell, looked like Tootie
Hey girl, how you doin, oh shit I looked back
My nigga Thes is on the mic about to bust another rap

Yo, this fool Thes,
Ay man you bout to rap huh

Standin like products of parental incest
But son, my tape's for sale so I hope you invest
Sunny up on skills, that's what I suggest

Drop some fresh rhymes, that is my request

Knight Lord Radio, held back by the Bay Bridge faded,
Trying to find Smiley's house, thank G-d we made it
Yo, blunts, broads and beats, keepin' low through the streets
And niggas givin' us pounds cause of these dope-ass sounds
We run aground like ships, over these beats I flip
The bass is hittin' so hard that your CD skips
Well check it out, make sure it doesn't happen again
I got my grip on it, so turn it up to volume ten
Volume ten, word, like that brother from LA
Lord Radio and Hellbot be streakin' through the Bay
We all-citiy like the Mayor, you see my name
I'm more fresh shit, the creep tailor,
The G for international ladies like a sailor,
Like a sailor I get drunk and bust flows to the beat
Like my man J, I feel the Agony in Defeat
Cause sucka-chumps want to test, step like we don't know
We doin, we doin shows in San Francisco
That's right young writer, got a hit for all you biters
Time to bless another track we getting rid of the whack
We put em in the back with the other Tapenze shit
Beats hit hard, make the trolly do olly
Old folks grabs their talus and vacate the bay
See a name in Northern Lights, there's love in Double K
We getting wild for the night, we getting wild for the night
And it all weighs down, what, what
 
On A Warm San Francisco Night
Yo, rocking shows for you and your crew
On A Warm San Francisco Night
We rollin blunts and doin the do

We doin shows wit a mic check a one two

[Verse 2]
We's drinkin, smoking, more smoking, more drinking
Didn't think about the morning hangover, just didn't want to be sober
Yo Radio, tell me how did you feel, 
Like I'll never catch a DUI, get gas,
Peel, make a left, yo it's the Double K
Ay, ay what's up
Roll up the windows and spark the joint
Yo, you didn't have to ask twice
Smokin on top of the hill, so we can peep the city life
I'm on award tour, we got it locked like Alcatraz 
Doin the San Francisco show I'm sure you realize
Ring the drums like Harvey Ray's son try it
Better look next time, try to step the beat
You in the Bay punk, I guess you ain't about LA
Yo Double K, tell ?em who's unique with the beats
BUTS shows and San Francisco treats
A San Francisco treat is like some Riceroni
Put it in your mouth and let it run down the middle just like Moni
Phony homey, can never rock the party
Your whack-ass crew gets called out
See I play the rod-roddy come on now
To the south punks have you feelin the concrete
Have you askin questions from your hands to your feet
You don't want to do the shit that I'm offering
Sayin that Pete can't rock your city, (what) who, you make a fool
Very often we win, yo very sudden we lose
Spice rockin' yo whole mother-fuckin city
 
On A Warm San Francisco Night
Yo, rollin blunts and doin the do (the do, the do)

Chillin wit your girl and her crew (her crew, her crew)

Scaring old people, still doin the do (we're doin the do)

(Double K)
I got, ten MC's held up in a line
Cause all these dudes told me that they knew how to rhyme
So which one will it be that I choose to test first
The way he grabbed the mic showed signs of a pussy and even worse
He was talkin bout a gat that wasn't tucked in his waist
So I ???? into the next sucka face (next)
This fool was pretty dope, told him, keep up the good work
Gave him a pound and a pin, moved on to this next jerk
Hey yo, dude looked like Usher with his chest all exposed
Bustin bout bitches he be hittin and his stupid ass clothes
Bitch smile on his face like there were hands in the air wavin'
But I was anticipatin with Satan to see him bakin'
Under the authority of someone lower than me
Started gettin tired (yawn!), skipped three, now here's the seventh MC
Looked like a pretty cool guy, but sounded like Treach (Hay! Ho!)
Moved around all fast screamin with weapons around his neck
It was like a fuckin joke, me and the gang got a good laugh,
He got all hot, tried to dulo, we beat his fuckin ass like
(sounds of fighting)
Number eight was a female, at least that's how I figured,
Until it started rappin, sounded like one of my niggas,
God damn this that, and all the guns in the world
Harder than most niggas on the mic, even had a Jheri Curl (damn!)
Sent her to Jenny Jones, for the little makeover,
Told her, ""be back in two weeks!"" you see all I wanted to do was bone her
Word, she's out like yesterday's six pack
So let's get back to the last two, yo they from the same crew,
What should we do, Thes said he knew them niggas from some open mic spot,
They tried to gun up, got cut up, so here's round 2

""Yea you money!  I'm talkin to you!""
""You got a battle rap?  Battle me!""
""Wassup?!""
""Battle me!""
""Wassup?!""

(Thes One)
Yo!  What would you do if I could prove you didn't exist and it was true
Like ??? solidified proof of your essence
Of you in the spoof of your birth
Now I guess that would lesson your worth to the dirt and the earth
And the leaf, now I leave you alone without belief that your really here
And assist you beneath your fear
An endearing tear would fall if all that I said was true,
Am I right or ???, too complex for quote
I'll have the final say,
Like the rope to the boat to the dock, you're not free yet, man
You're sick, stuck, caught, sick in the head,
Stuck to the bed, you're dumbfed
Diseased with that mononuclear, what I look like money?!
That latin listening to Coolio?  So I ask,
What was your mom's task when she had you?
If fully she knew that through all of her pain
Her baby was born without brain and insane and just plain,
no style!  No smile, your memories are worth a shitpile to me
You believe that you're free?!!  Man, free from your mom,
Free from the man and most of all free from me but you see,
I've caught you!  My bad you don't really exist,
So I got to, explain this so when I tell you how not to,
You won't do it, I'm screwin your thinkin!
I know I exist and I prove it cause I'm listening to you
But I ask, what if God was an evil genius who only made you believe you were 
true?
And your life was nothing man!  Just a really long dream
And when you die you'll start a whole new life, a whole new dream
But that was just a dream, and it seems man you can't break out the cycle
Am I crazy?  Go to your church and ask your white God if I'm right though,
Whatever he replies will be lies, we've already established this evil,
When I'm lying, you don't exist but merely as emotion and perceival,
Believe you'll be round tomorrow kid, yo,
You've borrowed time with no entrance,
And since you're a dream I can mentally put on the pinch
And you disappear in an instant,
Fool what?!  What?!

Yo Thes, what (what up?)
Can you rock the mic?

[Thes One]
A ha ha, my mellow my man, it's like ridin' a bike
Uh, Double K

[Double K]
What's Up?

[Thes One]
Can you rock it?

[Double K]
Like ridin' a bike, but only with training wheels
So what, shoot the gift and let them know the deal

[Thes One]
I shoot the gift like NRA members on Christmas
Morning warning rock MCs like isthmus like a principal

[Hook]
I'm the principal, our crew's invincible
Under The Stairs
Impairs auditroy of your whole municipal (municipal?)
Code area, attack like malaria
Concrete jungle bundle of joy
With bobby-boys
It's scary to think our tape destroys your crew's hopes (what?)
I can't cope with that, say no
Put it on a DAT, Double K
'Cause everything I say will one day give away
Or another recovered in it's original place
Signify this straight caligrified verse
Petrified rock, put your goddamn block in a herse

[Thes One]
Only thing worse, chaos bursts the eardrums, the P
Making the beats and rhymes funkally-dunkally
Fat like chunky here, but not out for radio play
Here's a crew washing the wax my mind space
Tight A, not Navy deals, no way
Pets for three sixty five days
I add a fourth 'cause I leap year
I leave tracks like Amtrack
Battles the P and Superman
After that your crew will try and forget like Izoin(?)
It's the Amistad, man Beckets(?) know it better
I rip it all up like a letter for the principal

[Thes One]
Chaos bursts...(Double K cuts in)

[Double K]

That's one, lace the track
Like a blow with the weak smell
Nigga, your stunned
Other from the brothers with another monkey(?) shit
Put the viddy(?) on the stick and make sure it don't skip
Hip-Hoppin is reallest, punk
You know you want to admit it
All these crews runnin around with fat tracks
They don't get it, the gettin distressed (word?)
The gettin me mad

[Thes One]
So what you sayin, Double K?

[Double K]
Just put that shit on my tab
Don't feel like dealin' with it now
I'll deal with it later
See, the mic's in my possession
Yo, so while she did it
To the minmute
Stupid frontin' since we first stepped in
Brought it back a couple of times
Now you give it a grin
First you tell your homey,
""Yeah man, that shit's fresh!""
Didn't know this kinda shit could be lurkin' the west
We puttin' hair on your chest
We flow with no hesitation
Late radio stations ain't allowed on these premesis
Millions hearin' this
Late at night like domestic violece
Smackin' you the fuck up
Until we get some silence (word)
Keep you like Judge Judy on the mic
Puttin' up a fight
Rollin' hard 'till the break of daylight
So next time you corny niggas want to come hardcore
Go listen to 'Lil Kim (word...)

(Scratched until end in various ways)",Time to Rock Our Shit
People Under the Stairs,"[Thes One:]
Yo, I think this time I've found a shorty for me
We talk a lot, take walks a lot, she doesn't bore me
In fact she won't ignore me when I'm speakin music matters
She's intelligent, fly style flatters
My own style, chickens scatter when she floats through the club
Child matters,
Love, I'm thinkin,
I met her one night drinkin, I suggested a show,
She walked up and said, ""I know you
You're from the P-U, T-S, I think your name is Thes too,""
Would you like a soda, I'm underage
Slipped her my number, tipped away
And said give me a page later
In typical Latin lady flavor she said ""Maybe,
Que si"" That's how it should be
And see she played me close, next night dinner,
The champagne toast, sunset pacific coast,
And most while, everything to me was like tight groovy
Always a treat, man, she took me to the movies
Made love to beats, woke up and made me pancakes
And this point I knew my shit was land or lakes
Fellas, I might be in love but something's still not right,
We didn't fight but she didn't call me last night
She got mad loot, no jobs, and plus a high renter
Cellular phone to check the Pac Bell message center,
Which she does too much, and I'm really not with it
She tells me that she loves me so I guess I'm committed

[Chorus: x 2]
Turndown days...
No way, no way
""It gets better, this girl's kinda clever""

[Double K:]
Yo I was coolin' at the club about ten on the dot
Drinkin' Hennessey and Coke, feeling like 2Pac
Me and the crew hit the stage in about a half of one
Trying to ditch security 'cause I'm under twenty-one
Just then, I see this fine Latin chick walk past
Face like never before, body like an hour glass
So I was lookin' at the booty, it was lookin' right back,
You would have thought she wanted loot but it wasn't like that
Yo this girl stepped to me, asked me, what was my name,
I told her, Mike, she looked with a grin, said, that's right
Then for a minute I started to wonder how she knew who I was,
Yo, we've been doin' mad shows with the underground buzz,
Then I asked her her name, yo I heard that somewhere,
Matter of fact, I have, but yo the K didn't care
All I wanted was the ass, only that and nothing more,
Talked a cool 15 minutes, got the number, hit the floor,
Saw Thes, gave him the DAT, we rocked the show,
Woke up the next day, aww shit, here we go
Seen a number in the pager that I didn't recognize,
Matched it up with the little paper received last night,
Word up, I'm 'bout to hit the skins like it was my first
Returned the call, got the address, and quenched my thirst,
Took a quick shower, was out in five minutes,
Big grin on my grill 'cause I knew I'd be up in it,
Her crib was in four, so I strolled down the road,
Kinda high off the blunt, bangin' on the front door,
She opened up, still in her nightclothes,
Foreplay was in effect before I closed the front door,
You know how it goes, fingers in her shoobie doobie,
Whispered in her ear that I wanted her to do me,
And we did it homeboy, all day and night,
But even after that, something still wasn't right,
What the fuck, Thes's beat tape doin' on your night stand?
Yo, I figured it out, it was a game-plan
I asked her what's up, she said I got a man,
And I got a what, what, what, what

[Chorus: x 2]

[Assault:]
Y'all didn't see me all day, I stayed at the bay awaitin',
The car from the maiden I had met when I was chasin'
Down the bus which I missed but I wasn't too pissed
When I spotted a sis, who lit my eyes like the trees
They put up on Christmas, I said, hey, how are you doin' today?
She said, aiight, the frame was tight so I continued her way,
Shootin' the breeze like LA, conversation was cool,
She went to school, had a job, and no meat was the rule,
Now not to send like a gay librarian,
I appreciate the fact you're vegetarian,
I eat some flesh once in awhile, was her reply,
And then she looked at me with an old look in her eye,
I said, what, I'm not your kind of nigga?
Not quite, but I'll be very interested to hang out with you tonight,
I thought whoa, huh, this girl's a sick puppy,
If she chills at the crib I'll probably get lucky
But she never showed... All day, I missed work...
But she never showed up...
I think she was bisexual
She had a fat ass...
It was like red, kinda like reddish brown

A struggle on my life till we vade the misconceptions
To find a place to live between the negatives and positives

Let the problems in your mind become ancient artifacts
Perhaps these raps can help you alleviate
The things that's got you trippin' you watch me demonstrate
First you ignore the nonsense and clear your conscience
Let your pen touch the paper write verbs and consonants

Yo L.A. hit me one time make it funky
Double down on my underground sound I'm feelin' lucky

We lay back chillin' and feelin' the music relates
We on the to the two hangin' with my crew
Bullshittin' while we sittin' down drinkin' our Sabu
And to the afternoon turns to the moonlight
Funky tracks and nickle sacks freestylin' all night
Doin' it right no one with time music make it better
My crew banging two blocks like shots from my Berretta
Snub no's to the hoes who pose I suppose
Honey you gotta understand your mans got flows
And I'm leavin' you so by the time I get the phoenix
Underground ground hits are goin' to fiend this musical genius
Transglobal by the books
Like Barnes with noble hooks
Armed with overlooked talented guests of while bless crooks
Who still lose and keep this shit alive
Something for your truths to sit around and bye bye
For camel double invest to ease stress
We bout to hip hop so have fun and god bless

People Under the Stairs,"I'm a cool latin lover libra disco king
And the ladies all scream when I'm on the scene
I got a gold plated plane to fly around the world
Just to pick up the mothers of fine little girls
I'm in the house y'all
And it's a family affair
And you can bring your sister she can clip my hair
If she ain't there well then I'm s*** outa luck
I'm in the house with mickey mouse and donald duck
You like re run
Trying to catch my truck
It's me and double chillin up in the cut
We're like starchy and hutch but a little more depth
I keep the forty on my right and the women and my left
I got a gold plated pit bull made out of ice
Yo his bark ain't loud but he sure ain't nice
And if you ask me twice
I'm going to tell you the same
It's rap basketball and doctor j is the name
'Cause I'm bound to go down in the hall of fame
And you can see my picture chillin up in the gold frame
Type that y'all
And you just don't stop
And that ya playing pac-man and running from the cops
It's like a nice chocolate Sunday with a cherry on top
I got a leather cadillac and I love to hip-hop
'Cause people always saying p ain't about nothing
But that's for the birds like thanksgiving stuffing
'Cause when I disco
I always prove my point
Yo I'm out baby brother

Like a lady that just gave birth
Double k is my name and la is my turf
I said we party all night like kool and the gang
Me and the little brother thes came to show our fame
We break the girls hearts and make the jams start
Surprise the sleepy kids like a fresh pop-tart
We up jump the boogie like scooby-doo
Smoke a doobie or two
And hanging out with the crew
I keep the green trees
So my car smells fresh
Take a bath with diamonds
I only bought the best
Keep my ladies well dressed
Never settle for less
Like a cold can of miller straight out the ice chest
I don't wear calvin klein
I wear louis vuitton
And that's word to you mothers and brothers of islam
Party people live long 'cause it's just begun
Got an intersect race just to have some fun
We're the cool party rockers
The old folk shocker
The whack rhyme stopper
Take a piece of something proper
I'm out for the cash
Gonna have a blast
Couple friends and some a** smoking up my hash
Got a smile on my face 'cause I own the place
I got rhymes from detroit straight to outaspace
Emcee's shut their trap
While I kick the old rap
Party down with my friends some skinny some fat
But one thing is for sure when we all hang loose
We tell stories bout our rhymes like mother goose
Or dr. seuess
It's the rap in the hat
So take that party people, take that haha

People Under the Stairs,"[Double K arguing with woman]
What you mean I ain't making no money off this hip-hop shit?
Yeah, I know this is all I do is stay up and make beats
You know, this is how we make our living
This is what the people want us to do
Nah, I'm not gonna get a job there
I'm not gonna work there, all day at The Gap
Fuck it, hey, come over here, let's listen to Thes One

[Thes One]
Check it out, it was me and Double K in my room in 95
Beatboxing on the mic, recording the tape live
Before we arrived on the scene, you know what I mean
When it was all about... I forgot, man forget it
See now the P is sweated as a global event
But it seems those closest to me seem the least to care
When it was ""Rah-rah, y'all can do it"" back in the day
Now it's like 3 hours deep and ""When are you getting paid?""
My records are played, I sleep smiling every night
But when I wake up, it's something else, a whole new fight
Like cats double crossing me, that I try and help out
If it wasn't for me and Double that shit wouldn't come out
So recognize whose the guys devoting they life to it
Sacrificed stability to flex our ability
Prove the inner artillery
I can't chill until we fufill the plan of having mic's in the hand
The sole reason I was cast down on this land
Is to sit in front of the MPC and turn the bland into the flambay
Things to play to make your day
Same shit 10 years ago I'm doing today
And 10 years from now, so don't ask how or even why
be	-boy for life, fuck a suit and a tie
'cause I'll know I made a difference on the day that I die
Aiyyo, I be	-boy for life so fuck a suit and a tie

[Double K]
Yeah... I feel you man
She be talking that ole bullshit, you know
You know, maybe you should get out and go get a job, ya know
Or--or, we can't spend enough time, ya know what I'm saying?
Just like you, maan, Big Thes man, 
I done spent all my life tryna do this hip-hop shit
Think it was like 95-96, when I...

Perfected my track skills on the SP
Murdered 10 seconds in a minute, peers couldn't get it
Mike was walking on water, my brother you shoulda seen it
Got ate up in some rap battles, I'm here to redeem it
Like a rain check hustler, scoping the aisles
Chocking lyrics making beats just to keep it on file
With the ADAT Zip on the floppy I'm never coming sloppy
No reason to copy niggas, I'm dope so go figure
Not conceided nigga, I'm confident when I'm dropping it
Hold the microphone firm, let the lyrics burn
Like the buddha to the sherm
I'm mellow with one word, two, let it cage, 
Bringing better days when I bust
Stay grounded with my head in the clouds and that's a must
Ya know, just a piece in my hip-hop black book
Outlining the track y'all watch for the hook
Filling in my ideas, here to keep your style shook
Never rapping like niggas just to be in the game
I'm coming from the inside so y'all remember my name
Yo, it's the K Dub, trouble bringing, the notorious one
Couldn't be stopped, keeping these sucka crews on the run, ya dig it?
No matter what y'all say, do or know, it's me and Thes One maintaining the... uhh...

Ya know how it goes, man... it's me and Thes One, like always, it's two of us... 
Keepin' it live... keepin' it fresh... I dunno man...
Sometimes I just feel like we can't take it no more
like we just gonna bust back ya know battle rapping, backpacking
Yeah... yeah... we backrapping... 
Backrapping and slapping all you fools in the face
You just a... you just a... 
Just a disgrace to the... to the.. to the.. yeah
I like how it sounds right there, man... 
It's real, real mellow, real jazzy like, ya dig
Oww... word up... oww... word up... ow... word up...

All you MC's say L.A. when you on stage
And when you do spit that hot verse
We gonna make it happen man

Who wanna test?

We make believers out the best

In southern California ain't no place like this
Half the stuff y'all doin' we created this shit
So don't be saggin young buck in the presence of this
Don't even come from the city and your runnin your lips
I'm 'bout to make a call get the news van out
Explain to Tritia Toyota on how your crew ran out
We comin live from the trey two three area code
Mad clouds of smoke and ain't no room for snow
Sucka niggas with sucka beats
Stay in the back seat and buckle up for the ride
I'm chillen with bad guys
And got time on my side
Cause this is my city this is where I live
And if ya bring bad vibes I got something to give
Hangin out under the sun is an everyday thang
And gettin crazy in the labs the only way I bang
Don't step to me with that mean face
Buddy I'm all smiles and I'm countin the miles
Down Crescent Heights boulevard
Home of the stars
Get ya pulled out ya car for frontin' too hard
Just listen, you ain't down with the streets my brotha?
I can forsee in your future ther'es some runnin for cover
Alot of y'all talk a good game
But ain't playin
I learned about the hood and now feel thats where your stayin
Fools be givin you the mad dog after the show
Cause we ain't feelin them flows
Or your designer clothes
Its phony people in L.A. I counted its alot
And if the hanus catch your a bully there claimin your block
Just get it right its Crescent Heights all day all night
The community where I was raised
Livin my days
Wishin I could be the mayor i'd deport you fools
And send you back to squareland cause over here we brew
Authentic people in the town
Throw up your dub take a drag
It's Double K signin off from the home of the bodybags

Yo about five years after they kill
Creep up the hipe
Wrestlee moovahs the sleepers
Drugdealers rock beepers
T tops, jerry curls, jelly flip flops for girls
C.B.'s on the strip and a commercial for 
World on Wheels I whistle to my crew up on the block
The Color soundtrack rock the Fatburger jukebox
My L.A. U.S.C. memories are every sticks who filed down clowns
Claimin the same tricks on this turf
My roots go deep like turbo Nerf
And the cops still sweat us
I roll on all blocks like I'm sellin paletas
And rock the bells
Home of the drive-by where they pop the shells
I eat at Charro's and La Barca, not Taco Bell
And if your not from the city then you should probably bail
Cause alot of cats are implants
Claimin our labels something to say and something to prove and
At the shows with the flows and they think the crowds groovin
Its like the 405 at 5:30 nobodys movin
I'm tired of non-recognition losin the mission to proven to cats
That my soundtracks and L.A. hat
When newjacks strap New York rap on the block
With a palm tree it makes me sick
All you underground producers get off Premier's dick and just (chill)
I'm headed back to Pedro to sit up on the hill
Next to the Korean bell eatin Busy Bee
Watchin waves swell high visibility Catalina and sail boats
Hollywood hip hop soaps and sit-com dreams
I make morphine for beat fiends
Support L.A. teens stay trippin with Cal Green
O.G. Jerry Duffey when I'm on your screen
I'm friends with neighborhood crack heads
And I know (?Ben?)

In it i'll never fear
I'll always stay here
Cause when I'm in L.A. my family's there",The L.A. Song
People Under the Stairs,"We tackle rhymes like your life lays time
We trying to get enough, we gotta fill up
Before it's all gone the song remains on
Until the beat stops

Never mind, no need to remind
You know who we be, yo it's the capital G's
Putting the P's in hip hop
Saying, hi to the ho's who wear hardly any clothes

He is looking at you
Watching you, watching me, the incredible MC
Chicks call me Mikey
(Why's that?)

'Cause I like they stare when I'm digging it
And know they wanna try they like the way I rap
They like the way I chill
Couple hours in a conversation, show 'em how I thrill

I'm a one minute man, I lick it then split it
Empty it out, fill it in like the blank and I'm out
Big Mike, that's right, give 'em something they can feel
Yo, I'm the top-ranked chief on the wheels of steel

I walk the streets of LA and feel comfortable
Me and the homie make music
And they come in with bull so next time
You got a rhyme that's blazing hot, throw it away
People Under to save the day

Sometimes it ain't timed, sometimes it can't be
This time we kick back and letcha conscious be free
The music is playing loud and we never haveta leave
We never gotta leave
(We never gotta leave)

Beautiful brown skin lady, ya move something
Montego bay style, smile from the Caribbean isle
No fronting while we pumping the beat
Audiophiles that jump in like I light up the seat

With the complete file scooters and 45s the palm trees
Red stripe nights the calm breeze
The type to relax ease back to conceive wax
And contact the origin of habitat
Two cats making fat, it's like that

With a rap similar to a pitti pat of a cat
Walking the roof to make it back to the truth
I dig crates for the late great existence of black plates
To booming the eighths on the floor

Thinking you want more
Leaving my mark like a doc mart on a wood floor
It's good for the soul like dinner witcha moms
People under the stairs the duo who drop bombs
Snares laid back like armchairs

Hit the beach I'm outta reach
So play my CD and let it teach the recipe
Half beatrocka, half tivity [unverified]
Walk a fresh breath control like Binaca

Sometimes it ain't timed, sometimes it can't be
This time we kick back and letcha conscious be free
The music is playing loud and we never haveta leave
We never gotta leave
(We never gotta leave)

And mama wants a new pack of George Benson & Hedges
They mentholated
To all my P fans I'm glad you waited
We graduated from paying dues to sitting on the porch
Brothers playing the blues in search of more pews
To fill up the funk church
The masses massive tabernacle it cracklely wax
To sample the man full of holy drums

With swollen thumbs, we walk through slums
Find some bottle with wood done, ya

That the people calling rap, yo we getting rid of that

Break beats getting discovered
Some get flipped to outnumber
The weak drum machines, don't use 'em won't abuse 'em
Getting funky like drunky
Call us the groove junkies
And we gotta have a fix every minute on the dot
Just the {drum kicks}
And we tearing up your block
You can hear it up the street
You can hear it in your sleep
Booming out the record stores while you at the swap meet
Macking to a seven feet
Crunching on a two piece
Said it'll make your day fucked up people, just trust me
We back on the three dot, booming in your ghetto blaster
Till midnight, feel right and party till you drop

Groove to the rhythm, something new to give 'em

Giving up funk for goods

Eating cheeseburgers with my pals, going home to lounge
In the styles of my predecessors
The B-Boy, never the less, the S, the western born
That early morn' to that yes yes y'all
Thes rock like a new clock on top of the school hall
Ringing roll call
Professor head shake, monitor the gym hall
Up taking out the fakes
With a twelve string incision
Reinvent the rhythm
The cats that's living just like us
Now envision a mathematician giving up a calculator
Ayo that's me without the funk, Double K rock the cross fader

Yo we got the whole world under surgery for funk transplants
Making music not hood so yo we don't got the look
We got bad memory, a gang of records and fans
Mad plans to keep it live with just the blink of an eye
Yeah we thought that you thought that we wasn't coming back
We turned around and smacked that clown
(Who told you that?)
We too cool for our britches, putting stitches on your zip disc
Get this, hip hop is the drug and we in rehab
Just be glad, that you don't live close to us
Then you see most of us
And we be known to bust
With no [?] junior should've learned a little sooner
It's the two forties in the tight ish running to ya
Two villains in the car chase (crash!)
Throw your roadblock of weak beats
Continuing the mission through the streets
Of the angel town
With my Steeley Dan Brown
While I groove with the rhythm, move with the rhythm
Get off with it
I'm about to quit it but before I step off it's like

People Under the Stairs,"It took years of pain, struggle, and strife from not knowing
To up-step stage, sound check, and wreck shows
With the nice confidence, critically precise
Reassuring my brother, rolling the dice, making life ice
Locked on new blocks, promoters, and cities
Alone on the road, temp well-below fifty
What a pity, it comes down to mics and a pillow
Couple handshakes, hash browns and a hello
From a fan to make it worthwhile with the plan
To cover more miles than any man should have
In limited time, with unlimited rhymes to give for b-boys
Unified in towns where they live, worldwide
And at the same time, it’s still cold
Thousand miles away with your life on hold
At home in other times zones, doing our best
Travelling train-to-plane, stretching out, getting rest
In uncomfortable positions, a show rocking missions
Looking for an audience or crowd that’ll listen
And it happens, put my worthwhile in my rap
And a paycheck in the form of loud handclapping
Back to the hotel, next night, same thing
Nothing glamorous, we’re just doing our thing
And go back to the hotel (same thing)
Nothing glamorous, we’re just doing our thing

I come home to shadiness at least eighty percent of the time
‘Cause I was out getting mine, tripping, kicking the rhyme
Ol’ girl don’t understand that’s why it’s getting better each time
Chilling in the spotlights, Corona and lime
When I point, it’s the joint, y’all, I’m having a ball
Travelling without the battling of who’s weak and who’s raw
Just in the state of mind of partying and ripping rhymes
Smoking out the green room, cracking jokes, drinking wine
But sometimes, I unwind and find myself sober
And called home in about a week, technically it’s overseas
Where I’mma find myself at the bottom of this
Chain smoking anything, hollering at Chris
He say he going through it too, asking what we gotta do
I said we got an interview at a half past two
With all feelings aside, a soundcheck at five o’clock
We up, set to rock another night outta thirty of them
Keep the greens coming (two kinds!), and I can recline
Over to the next state line and dealing with time
An all-star rap show, proving the thought
Keeping it moving, country-to-country-to-state, we heavy grooving
But you see, I got obligations at home
My mind telling me someone’s having relations at home
All I can do is stay high and focus on the P
But it’s that angel and that devil, and he’s sitting, fucking with me
I’m L.A.-International-bound, pack up the sound, head West
I got smooth intentions on breaking necks
But first, I’m heading to the bank with a big grin
It’s a couple that know I’m coming back to do it again (ah, ha ha!)
And I’m talking ‘bout you, you, you… oh, but not you

Kiss your mama goodbye, we’re hitting the road
No tour bus, carrying our own load
So throw it in a bag, pack it up, and let’s go
Travel ‘round the globe, trying to rock a fresh show

People Under the Stairs,"There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for.
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.

There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.
Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh, it makes me wonder.

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,
And my spirit is crying for leaving.
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,
And the voices of those who standing looking.
Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh, it really makes me wonder.

And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason.
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter.

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,
It's just a spring clean for the May queen.
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on.
And it makes me wonder.

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,
The piper's calling you to join him,
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul.
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold.
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last.
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll.

And she's buying a stairway to heaven.",Reflections

Là-bas où il fait chaud, où le ciel n’a pas son pareil 
Tu sais qu’au bout de cette terre
Oui, les gens sèment 
Des milliers de graines de joie 
comme pousse ici la haine 
On m’avait dit p’tit gars 
Là-bas on t’enlève tes chaînes 
On te donne une vie 
Sans te jeter dans l’arène 
Comme ici tout petit 
Après neuf mois à peine 
On te plonge dans une vie 
Où tu perds vite haleine 
Alors sans hésiter, j’ai sauté dans la mer 
Pour rejoindre ce vaisseau 
Et voir enfin cette terre 
Là-bas trop de lumière 
J’ai dû fermer les yeux 
Mais rien que les odeurs 
Remplissaient tous mes vœux

Just wanna be free in my world 
Vivere per libertà 
Vivere nella libertà 

Woah, woah

Alors une petite fille aussi belle que nature 
Me prit par la main et me dit: suis cette aventure 
On disait même, oh oui, que la mer l’enviait 
Que la montagne se courbait pour la laisser passer 
Elle m’emmena au loin avec une douceur sans fin 
Et ses bouclettes dorées dégageaient ce parfum 
Qui depuis des années guidait ce chemin 
Ton chemin, mon chemin, le chemin 

I just wanna be free in this way 
Just wanna be free in my world 
Vivere per libertà 
Vivere nella libertà 

Pour arriver enfin à ces rêves d’enfants 
Qui n’ont pas de limites comme on a maintenant 
J’ai vu des dauphins nager dans un ciel de coton 
Où des fleurs volaient, caressant l’horizon 
J’ai vu des arbres pousser, remplaçant les gratte-ciels 
J’ai vu au fond de l’eau une nuée d’hirondelles 

I just wanna be free in this way 
Just wanna be free in my world

Pepe Aguilar,"Esta tristesa mia 
Ese dolor tan grande
Lo llevo muy profundo puesme ha dejado 
Solo en el mudo 
Ya ni llorar es bueno 
Cuando no hay esperanza 
Ya ni el vino niquila las 
Penas amargas que ami me matan 
Yo no se que sera de mi suerte quede mi 
No se acuerda mi dios 
Hay pobre de mis hojos como han llorado 
Por su traicion",Esta Tristeza Mia
Pepe Aguilar,"Amor como el nuestro, No hay dos en la vida
Por mÃ¡s que se busque, Por mÃ¡s que se esconda
Tu duermes conmigo, Toditas las noches
Te quedas callada, Sin ningun reproche

Por eso te quiero, por eso te adoro
Eres en mi vida, todo mi tesoro

A veces regreso, borracho de angustia
Te lleno de besos why caricias mustias
Pero estas dormida, no sientes caricias
Te abrazo a mi pecho, me duermo contigo

Mas luego despierto, tu no estÃ¡s conmigo
Solo estÃ¡ mi almohada

A veces te miro, callada why ausente
why sufro en silencio, como tanta gente
Quisiera gritarte, que vuelvas conmigo
Que si aÃºn estoy vivo, sÃ³lo es para amarte

Pero todo pasa why a los sufrimientos
como las palabras, se las lleva el viento

Por eso regreso, borracho de angustia
Te lleno de besos why caricias mustias
Pero estas dormida...",Almohada

Que hay que saber barajar
Pa saber cual es la tuya
Di la que vas a apostar

Porque no les tienes miedo

Pepe Aguilar,"Casi todos sabemos querer

Amar es sufrir, querer es gozar.

Y nunca sufrir, y nunca sufrir.

El querer pronto puede acabar, 
El amor no conoce el final,

Pero pocos sabemos amar.

El amar es la cielo y la luz, 
El amar es total plenitud,
Es el mar que no tiene final, 
Es la gloria y la paz, es la gloria y la paz.

El querer es la carne y la flor, 
Es buscar el obscuro rincon,
Es morder, aranar y besar, 
Es deseo fugaz, es deseo fugaz.

Todo lo da, todo lo da.
El que quiere pretende olvidar
Y nunca llorar y nunca llorar.

Y cuando hables de mí
Digas que todo acabó
Jamás me echarás de ti
Aunque te duela reconocerlo

Por más que quieras callar
No podrás evitar que tu corazón
Hable por ti, me tendrás allí
Donde estés, con quien estés

Donde estés
Entre lágrimas y risas
Por olvidarme tendrás prisa
Y no podrás

Con quién estés
Aunque le demuestres lo contrario
Y le ames a diario me recordarás

Donde estés
Si alguien te pregunta por el pasado
Negarás que tu me has dado
Algo de ti con quien estés

Si nos vemos algún día
Evitarás la mirada mía
Y buscarás la de él

Jamás me cansaré
De amanecer pensando en ti
Esperando oír estas palabras
Amor mío, he decidido volver

Donde estés
Entre lágrimas y risas

Era un domingo, señores
Como a las tres de la tarde
Estaba Jesús García
Acariciando a su madre

Dentro de pocos momentos
Madre tengo que partir
Del tren se escucha el silbato
Se acerca mi porvenir

Cuando llegó a la estación
Un tren ya estaba silbando
Y un carro de dinamita
Ya se estaba quemando

El fogonero le dice
Jesús, vámonos apeando
Mira que el carro de atrás
Ya se nos viene quemando

Jesús García le contesta
Yo pienso muy diferente
Yo no quiero ser la causa
De que muera tanta gente

Le dio vuelta a su vapor
Porque era de cuesta arriba
Y antes de llegar al seis
Allí terminó su vida

Desde ese día inolvidable
Tú te has ganado la cruz
Tú te has ganado las palmas
Eres un héroe Jesús

No es agua mi amor son tan solo mis besos
Si el sol en la calle calienta tu cara
Son rayos de amor que me salen del alma

Si el aire una tarde alborota tu pelo
No es el viento soy yo que
Quisiera vivir en tu pensamiento

Pepe Aguilar,"El día que yo me muera
Que me entierren con la banda
No me anden con lutitos
Que es purita propaganda
Mi vida es ser muy alegre
Siempre andando de caramba
Por eso quiero morirme

Al tranco de un buen caballo
Y al son de la balacera
Con diez cajas de cerveza
Y la joven que yo quiera
Me gusta rifar mi suerte
Y jugarme hasta la vida
Pa’ curarme las heridas
Con mi negra consentida
La noche siempre es bonita
Para empezar la parranda
Y amanecer por las calles
Paseándose con la banda
Al tranco de un buen caballo

No te miento cuando digo, que este amor es de verdad
Te quiero sin importar, lo que la historia decida
Que por ti daría la vida, nunca vayas a dudar

Y es tan sólo por amor, que no quiero hacerte daño
Ni causarte algún dolor, créeme que será mejor
Si no digo que te amo

Porque tengo el corazón equivocado por quererte demasiado
Sin que seas para mi, porque sigo siendo así
Mismo tonto enamorado, que a su amor verá callado
Sólo por verte feliz si es con él y no a mi lado
Ni contigo ni sin ti

Duele tanto la verdad, vivo en la melancolía
Al saber que no eres mía, y siempre en mente estar
No falta sinceridad, ni es cuestión de cobardía
Lo que siento intentaría, pero sé que te hago mal

Y es tan sólo por amor, que no quiero hacerte daño
Ni causarte algún dolor, lo que hago es lo mejor
Si no digo que te amo

Por que tengo el corazón equivocado por quererte demasiado
Sin que seas para mi, porque sigo siendo así
Mismo tonto enamorado, que a su amor verá callado

Pepesito Reyes,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

Waiting for me Mary, no, Mary Tyler Moore
I love her, she love no one else

I know you can't feel it 'cause you feel no the pain

That you ain't got no style, ain't got no reggae
And there are words that I just don't say
Take a pick, you've got a selection
But if you want some of this protection

Oh, na, na, na
Feels good, when it should
Sit back it takes a while

Listen, there are stories tales and lies
Some attract rumors, some attract lies
Got this coffee, so bring me your cup
One more pot so we can stay up

While my backs against the wall
Take a ride, competition take a ride
Pull it operator watch the other side

As they dance into the sun

Some big up new style holding trophy cups
Rory select while these speakers erupt
Sound sweeter in an echo chamber
Don't you know they are the danger
Three bottles of Cristal and it's agreed
The best could only come from the Don Wesley
Close my eyes while I take a ride

If you've got a problem with your love affair,
Cry to someone who cares but don't cry to me! 

I got the bottle empty, I'm holding my last twenty,
Down at the corner discount liquor store.
It's a â??quick fixâ?? recipe,
And â??the basicsâ?? are not basic for me,
The more it goes, it just seems the same,
As I'm still trying to explain

Cry to someone who cares, but don't cry to me!

Pepper,"She loves the party, I can see
Her dress is worn perfectly
A speaker shuffle her dancing feet
My tongue trips me up when I speak

Now she's the type of girl that could only be trouble
Looking the part, right the start she hands me a green bottle
She asks me for the time, I reply 'No thanks, I'm fine'
Then she laughs and asks what I was thinking of

I want a part of your crazy love
It's really all I'm ever thinking of
I need a part of your crazy love
It's a crazy love, it's a crazy love

Not so hard to persuade
She gives a smile, puts it away
And that's enough for me to
Do what you want to do

Soft spoken hanging through the morning
Really don't pay attention to the breakfast she's burning
The food is on my plate, I lie and say 'It's great'
Then she smiles and asks what I was dreaming of

I want a part of your crazy love
It's really all I'm ever thinking of
I need a part of your crazy love
It's a crazy love, it's your crazy love

I'll finish the dishes put on some records if you know how
Makes the selection singing dread natty dread now
She threw me again and again extended don't let it in
This is exactly what I was thinking of, woah, yeah

I want a part of your crazy love
It's really all I'm ever thinking of

And look how, you won't dance with me
Well, has this symbol made you so mean
That you're looking so far past me

When you say what you say but don't walk away
My tongue so tired from putting out the fire
That I, I started in the first place

So pretend you're in my shoes, you got nothing to lose
And if I'm acting slutty then it's probably from the booze

What's wrong with your face, you never smile anymore
What's wrong with your face, you never close your eyes
When I kiss your face, you never smile anymore
What's wrong with your face, ohh

And sometimes I sit and wonder
Why I bother when I know that all this anger's for your father
Can you hear me, she's gonna kill me

When she finds out your magazines that are dirty
I feel so dirty, but nothing can hurt me
Except the way you shake your head

When you you say what you say but don't walk away

Must he bend his knees?
Or can't he really be free? free? free?

The bell rings at the school
And saw his children take their place
Teach them by the rule
That no one hates them honest face

Or just outside that room
And ask for a ghetto broom
And child is born to see
That he might never be free, free, free

Could he and I make us friends truly?
Or is the song that were really just a lie to me?
The fact that nothing's being done as a circumstance
The time is short and we may never get a chance
Uh-huh, a chance, uh-huh

Springtime in the air
And sparrows teach their young to fly
Sitting down despair
With tears of anguish in my eyes

The word of love is true
And it will surely do, if we could only see
A man just has to be free, free, free
Free, free, free
Free, free, free (free! free! free! free!)
Free, free, free (free! free! free! free!)",Free

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Per Goldschmidt,"In my imagination, I'm finding consolation
Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing
Someone along the Rio Grande
 
It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine
Percy Faith,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon
Percy Faith,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening
Percy Faith,"I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

Won't you please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree for me, for me

Christmas Eve will find me

I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams",I'll Be Home for Christmas
Percy Faith,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring

It might as well be Spring",It Might as Well Be Spring [From State Fair]
Percy Faith,"Oh, you can kiss me on a Monday
A Monday, a Monday is very, very good
Or you can kiss me on a Tuesday
A Tuesday, a Tuesday, in fact I wish you would
Or you can kiss me on a Wednesday
A Thursday, a Friday and Saturday is best
But never, never on a Sunday
A Sunday, a Sunday, 'cause that's my day of rest
 
Most any day you can be my guest
Any day you say, but my day of rest
Just name the day that you like the best
Only stay away on my day of rest
 
Oh, you can kiss me on a cool day, a hot day
A wet day, which everyone you choose
Or try to kiss me on a gray day, a May day
A pay day, and see if I refuse
And if you make it on a bleak day
A freak day, a week day, why you can be my guest
But never, never on a Sunday",Never on Sunday
Percy Faith,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile
Percy Faith,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",Windmills of Your Mind

If we had the chance to do it all again

Percy Faith,"Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring

When I was young my heart was young then too
Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you
When you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you",Snowbird
Percy Faith,"I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now
Never can say goodbye

Even though the pain and heartache
Seem to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show,

Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so

That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now
Never can say goodbye

Every time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right through the core
It says, turn around, you fool
You know you love him more and more
Tell me why is it so

Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh baby (don't wanna let you go girl)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no
Ooh, oh I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh ooh (don't wanna let you go girl)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, ooh

Never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now
Never can say goodbye

I keep thinking that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
There's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's the same old dizzy hangup
Can't do with you or without
Tell me why is it so
Don't wanna let you go

I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh baby (hey baby)

I had it all right on my back

Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home

Where I'm going, where I've been
But there's a dream I've been following so long
If mama knew the things I've done
She'd forgive them everyone
But I'm still five hundred miles away from home

Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home

Can't remember when I ate
it's just thumb and walk and wait
And I'm still five hundred miles away from home
If my luck had been just right
I'd be with them all tonight

Percy Faith,"Once there were greenfields kissed by the sun;
Once there were valleys where rivers used to run;
Once there was blue sky with white clouds high above;
Once they were part of an everlasting love.
We were the lovers who strolled through greenfields.

Greenfields are gone now, parched by the sun;
Gone from the valleys where rivers used to run;
Gone with the cold wind that swept into my heart;
Gone with the lovers who let their dreams depart.
Where are the greenfields that we used to roam?

I'll never know what made you run away.
How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day?
I only know there's nothing here for me,
Nothing in this wide world left for me to see.

But I'll keep on waitin' 'til you return.
I'll keep on waiting until the day you learn
You can't be happy while your heart's on the roam.
You can't be happy until you bring it home,
Home to the greenfields and me once again.",Greenfields

It is a special one, it's never seen the sun

It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming

With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,

It ran one step ahead 
As we followed in the dance

All the sweet, green icing flowing down

Foaming like a wave 
On the ground around your knees 
And the birds, like tender babies in your hands 
And the old men playing checkers by the trees

For I will sing it 
There will be another dream for me

I will drink the wine while it is warm 
And never let you catch me looking at the sun 
And after all the loves of my life 
After all the loves of my life 
You'll still be the one 

I will take my life into my hands and I will use it 
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it

That you and I have finally said goodbye

And my love was ready for the takin',
Still I won't complain for someday love will call again

when we would dream and scheme and while the time away,
I have a dream, so did you.

and now, now it seems those yester-dreams were just a cruel 
and foolish game we used to play,
yester-me, yester-you, yester-day.
 
Where did it go, that yester-glow
When we could feel the wheel of life turn our way.

When I recall what we had,
I feel lost, I feel sad.

Percy Faith," came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth, goodwill to men, from heav'n's all gracious king
The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing.

Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurl
And still their heavenly music floats, O'er all the weary world.
Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing.

O ye, beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
O rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing.

For lo the days are hastening on, by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When the new heaven and earth shall own the prince of peace their King
And the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way
Percy Faith,"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old

Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue

Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure

Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind

Percy Faith,"There's a rising moon for every falling star
Makes no difference just how sad or blue you are
One never knows about tomorrow
Just what another day may bring

One moment in your heart it's Winter
Comes a rose and suddenly it's Spring

And a bright tomorrow for each girl and boy

Just a kiss away from where you are

Sure as summer follows spring, all the things you do
Give me a reason to build my world around you

Some men search for silver some for gold

And then I stop and say all right
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you, you

You always keep me guessing
I never seem to know what you are thinking
And if a girl looks at you
It's for sure your little eye will be a-winking

I get confused, I never know where I stand
And then you smile and hold my hand
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you

And if you decide some day to stop this little game
That you are a-playing
I'm gonna tell you all the things
My heart's been a-dying to be saying

Just like a ghost you've been a-haunting my dreams
And now I know you're not what you seem
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you

Percy Sledge,"Out of reach of my two empty arms

Love that runs away from me
Dreams that just won't let me be
Blues that keeps on bothering me
Chains that just won't set me free

Too far away from you and all your charms
Just out of reach of my two empty arms

Each night in dreams, I see your face
Memories, time cannot erase
And I awake and find you gone
And I'm so blue and all alone

So far away from you, so sweet and warm
Just out of reach of my two empty arms

That lonesome feeling all the time
Knowing that you could not be mine
Dreams that hurt me in my sleep
Vows that we could never keep

So far away from you and all your charms
Just out of reach of my two empty arms

Turned a whiter shade of pale

Percy Sledge,"Out of reach of my two empty arms

Love that runs away from me
Dreams that just won't let me be
Blues that keeps on bothering me
Chains that just won't set me free

Too far away from you and all your charms
Just out of reach of my two empty arms

Each night in dreams, I see your face
Memories, time cannot erase
And I awake and find you gone
And I'm so blue and all alone

So far away from you, so sweet and warm
Just out of reach of my two empty arms

That lonesome feeling all the time
Knowing that you could not be mine
Dreams that hurt me in my sleep
Vows that we could never keep

So far away from you and all your charms
Just out of reach of my two empty arms

'25 a racing blot on a bright green sea
Ahead the dim blur of an alien land
Time to give ourselves to strange gods' hands

Reaching twisted claws on every side

No place to hide
No turning back on a suicide ride

Sprouting clumps of mushrooms like a world surreal

Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger 
't was goodbye at the villa Capri

Pérez Prado,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

He spent his pay on whiskey
That was made in Tennessee
As I was growing up
He spent a lot of time with me
When I'd ask him about women
He'd just grin
He said son I know horses
Like the back of my hand

He said some were born to run
Some will stomp you just for fun
And some have got the devil in their eyes
There's some that you can trust
Some will leave you in the dust
And the wild ones will shake you up inside
But you'll always remember the ride

Like him I rode some horses
Some were fast and some were slow
I've known my share of women
I've seen 'em come
I've seen 'em go
The horses I could handle
But the women got me thrown
Now I smile when I remember that old man
Because he knew more than horses
Like the back of his hand 

He said some were born to run
Some will stomp you just for fun
And some have got the devil in their eyes
There's some that you can trust
Some will leave you in the dust
And the wild ones will shake you up inside
But you'll always remember the ride

Perfect Stranger,"You look just like her
But you don't fool me
'Cause I know her sweet love
Was more than a dream
How did I miss it when you took her place
There's not a trace of her love on your face

So please tell me who are you
And where is the girl I knew
She said her love was true
You're breaking my heart
Something she'd never do
Who are you

Go back where you came from
And send her back here
Use the same magic 
That made her disappear
I want the girl who thought I hung the moon
The last thing I want is some stranger saying we're through

So please tell me who are you
And where is the girl I knew
She said her love was true
You're saying goodbye

Perfect Stranger,"I never listened to hurtin' songs, but I'm listenin' now
Since you've been gone sad songs are all they play
The sun's going down on music town and what's killing me
Is everywhere I turn it's another number one for me?

Chiseled in stone, help me hold on
It was almost like a song
Born to lose, am I blue
I'll always love you
Since you've been gone
The hits just keep on comin' all night long

I could be in some bar or alone in my car doin' just fine
Till the DJ comes on and plays a song
That sends shivers up and down my spine
Then out of the blue I start thinkin' of you and the good love we had
Tell me how come every song that I hear has to be slow and sad?

Chiseled in stone, help me hold on
It was almost like a song
Born to lose, am I blue
I'll always love you
Since you've been gone
The hits just keep on comin' all night long

Just you and I, don't close your eyes
I'm so lonesome I could cry

He stopped lovin' her today

Perfect Strangers,"Don't you see that funeral train? Don't you see that funeral train? Rolling down that lonesome valley It's the longest one I've seen. 

May the 1st was bright and clear 1900 was the year A great explosion rocked our town While the men were underground. 

When we gathered at the slide We thought that just a few had died Fought our way in past the mine head Carried out two hundred dead. 

When we brought them to the light It was black and an awful sight In one family there were nine Lost inside that burning mine. 

A miner's life is hard I know His work is dark and far below While he starves and goes in rags He's cheaper than the coal he digs. 

",Scofield Mine Disaster
Perfect Strangers,"The judge said 'Stand up, lad, 

And dry up your tears.

You're sentenced to Dartmoor 

For twenty-one years.

So dry up your tears, love,

And kiss me goodbye,

The best friends must part,

So must you and I.

I hear the train coming, 

Twill be here at nine. To take me to Dartmoor 

To serve up my time. I look down the railway 

And plainly I see, 

You standing there waving 

Your goodbyes to me.

Six months have gone by, love, 

I wish I were dead.

This dark dreary dungeon 

And stone for my bed. 

It's hailing, it's raining, 

The moon gives no light. 

Now won't you tell me, love, 

Why you never write?

I've counted the days, love, 

I've counted the nights, 

I've counted the footsteps, 

I've counted the lights, 

I've counted the raindrops, 

I've counted the stars, 

I've counted a million 

Of these prison bars.

I've waited, I've trusted, 

I've longed for the day, 

A lifetime, so lonely, 

Now my hair's turning grey. 

My thoughts are for you, love, 

Till I'm out of my mind, 

For twenty-one years 

Is a mighty long time
I've counted on you, babe, to give me a break. 
I guess you forgot, love, I'm here for your sake. 
You know who's guilty, you know it so well, 
But I'll rot in prison, before I will tell. 

Come all you young fellows with hearts brave and true, 
Don't believe any woman you'd meet if you do, 
Don't trust any woman, no matter what kind, 
For twenty-one years, boys, is a mighty long time.

E o que era inabalável hoje vive por um triz

Fomos pouco a pouco nos tratando como dois estranhos
Como dois rivais
Transformando os sonhos em frustrados planos
Invejando a vida de outros casais

Não vou me conformar

Tua ausência me fez enxergar
Tudo aquilo que quis me mostrar

As nossas fotos pela casa toda vez
Que eu olho começo a chorar
Não sei mais o que faço pra curar a dor
Meu coração implora pelo seu amor

Queria que você soubesse que eu te amo tanto

Falling to strain, but I still persist

Refuse the violent source and pain that made you
Left to deny that it will change with no solitude

Chasing the race
Left to complete

Working to be

Perry Como,"Oh Baiá, when twilight is deep in the sky, Baiá 
Someone that I long to see, keeps haunting my memory 
An' so the loneliness deep in my heart calls to you, calls to you! 
(Oh Baiá) Oh Baiá
 
(I live in the memory of many dreams ago, 
When the stars were bright and you were mine alone
My love for you can not die, though the oceans run dry 
Or heaven's call from the sky, now you're gone!) 
 
Baiá, can't you hear my lonely call?
Morea, make my life complete again! 
How I pray for the day when I'll see you smile 
And my heart will beat again! 
 
Oh Baiá, when twilight is deep in the sky, Baiá 
Someone that I long to see, keeps haunting my memory 
And so the loneliness deep in my heart calls to you, calls to you!

Perry Como,"Quiet nights 'n quiet stars, quiet chords from my guitar 
Floating on the silence that surrounds us 
Quiet thoughts 'n quiet dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams 
Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together 

We will live eternally in this mood of reverie 
Away, from all the earthly cares around us 
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it 
And all at once the happiness I knew, 
Became these quiet nights of loving you!

Perry Como,"Sky, so vast as the sky 
With far away clouds just wandering by . . . 
Where did they go? 
Oh I don't know, don't know . . . 

Wind, that speaks to the leaves 
Telling stories that no one believes . . . 
Stories of love 
Belong to you and me . . . 

Oh Dindi . . . 
If I only had words 
I would say all the beautiful things that I see 
When you're with me 
Oh my Dindi! 

Oh Dindi . . . 
Like the song of the wind in the trees 
That's how my heart is singing Dindi, happy Dindi, 
When you're with me! 

I love you more each day, 
Yes I do, yes I do . . . 
I'd let you go away 
If you take me with you! 

Don't you know Dindi . . . 
I'd be running an' searching for you, 
Like a river, that can't find the sea, 
That would be me, without you my Dindi! 

 

Don't you know Dindi . . .

Perry Como,"How insensitive, I must have seemed 
When she told me that she loved me,
How unmoved an' cold, I must have seemed 
When she told me so sincerely 
 
Why, she must have asked 
Do I just turn an' stare in icy silence? 
What was I to say, 
What can you say when a love affair is over? 
 
Now, she's gone away 
And I'm alone with a memory of her last look,
Vague an' drawn an' sad, I see it still 
All her heartbreak in that last look
 
How, she must have asked 
Could I just turn an' stare in icy silence?

What can one do when a love affair is over? 
 
What can you do 
When a love affair is over?

Perry Como,"I'll sing to the sun in the sky,
I'll sing till the sun rises high,
Carnival time is here,
Magical time of year,
And as the time draws near,
Dreams lift my heart!

I'll sing as I play my guitar,
I'll cling to a dream from afar,
Will love come my way,
This Carnival day,
And stay here in my heart?

Will true love come my way,
On this Carnival day,
Or will I be alone with my dream?",Manha de Carnaval
Perry Como,"In my loneliness when you're gone and I'm all by myself
An' I need your caress, I just think of you
And the thought of you holding me near
Makes my loneliness soon disappear

Though you're far away
I have only to close my eyes and you are back to stay
I just close my eyes and the sadness missing you brings
Soon is going and this heart of mine sings
Yes, I love you so and that for me is all I need to know

I will wait for you 'til the sun falls out of the sky
For what else can I do?
I will wait for you meditating how sweet life will be
When you come back to me

I will wait for you, meditating how sweet life will be
When you come back to me
Became these quiet nights of loving you

I will wait for you 'til the sun falls out of the sky
For what else can I do?
I will wait for you meditating how sweet life will be
When you come back to me
Come back to me

Perry Como,"Once I loved  
And I gave so much love to this love 
It was the world to me! 
Once I cried 
At the thought I was foolish an' proud 
And let you say goodbye! 
Then, one day
From my infinite sadness you came 
And brought me love again! 
Now I know 
That no matter whatever befalls 
I'll never let you go! 
I will hold you close, make you stay 
Because love is the saddest thing 
When it goes away 
Love is the saddest thing

When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

It was far, too high

I will be remembering

Perry Como,"Dear, it seems years since we parted,
Years full of tears and regret;
I've been alone broken hearted,
Trying so hard to forget:
 
Girl of my dreams I love you, honest I do,
You are so sweet,
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms,
Then life would be complete;
Since you've been gone dear, life don't seem the same,
Please come back again.
And after all's said and done, there's only one,
Girl of my dreams, it's you.
 
It's strange how life deals you sorrow,
Sunshine and joy always nigh;
We live and learn for tomorrow,
But sometimes the learning comes high:
 
Girl of my dreams I love you, honest I do,
You are so sweet,
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms,

In all of my dreams, 
I walk with my arms about Linda

Can't help feelin' gloomy, 
Think of all the lovin' I've missed!

I'd stop for a while,

But miracles still happen, 
And when my lucky star begins to shine, 
With one luck break I'll make Linda

Perry Como,"I've got a longing way down in my heart
For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""

Last night I strolled to that old neighborhood
There on that corner I silently stood
I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine

Perry Como,"I was sleeping and right in the middle of a good dream
Like all at once I wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you (I think I love you)

This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room
I think I love you (I think I love you)

I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I got so much to think about

Hey, I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say I never felt this way

Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy and if you say ""hey go away"" I will
But I think better still I'd better stay around and love you
Do you think I have a case let me ask you to your face

That he'll only break me heart again

Perry Como,"It was the night before Christmas
When all through the house
Not a creature was stirring
Not even a mouse

The stockings all hung
By the chimney with care
In hopes that St. Nicholas
Soon would be there

The children were nestled
All safe in their beds
While visions of sugarplums
Danced in their heads

And mom in her kerchief
And I in my cap
Had just settled down
For a long winter's nap

When out on the lawn
There arose such a clatter
I sprang from my bed
To see what was the matter

Away to the window
I flew like a flash
Tore open the shutters
And threw up the sash

The moon on the breast
Of the new fallen snow
Gave the lustre of midday
To object below

When what to my wandering eyes
Should appear
But a miniature sleigh
And eight tiny reindeer

With a little ol' driver
So lively and quick
I knew in a moment
It must be St. Nick

More rapid than eagles
His courses they came
As he whistled and shouted
And called them by name

And quot, now dasher
Now dancer
Now prancer
Now vixen

On comet
On cupid
On doner
An' blitzen' and quot

To the top of the porch
To the top of the wall
Now dash away, dash away
Dash away all

As dry leaves
Before the wild hurricane fly
When they meet with an obstacle
Mount to the sky

So, up to the housetop
The courses they flew
With a sleigh full of toys
And St. Nicholas too

And then in a twinkling
I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing
Of each little hoof

As I drew in my head
And was turning around
Down the chimney St. Nicholas
Came with a bound

He was dressed all in fur
From his head to his foot
And his clothes were all tarnished
With ashes and soot

A bundle of toys
He had flung on his back
And he looked like a peddler
Just opening his pack

His eyes how they twinkled
His dimples how merry
His cheeks were like roses
His nose like a cherry

His drawl little mouth
Was drawn up like a bow
And the beard of his chin
Was a white as the snow

The stump of his pipe
He held tight in his teeth
And the smoke it encircled his head
Like a wreath

He had a broad face
And a round little belly
That shook when he laughed
Like a bowl full of jelly

He was chubby and plump
A right jolly old elf
I laughed when I saw him
In spite of myself

A wink of his eye
And a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know
I had nothing to dread

He spoke not a word
But went straight to his work
And filled all the stockings
Then turned with a jerk

An' laying a finger
Along side his nose
An' giving a nod
Up the chimney he rose

He sprang to his sleigh
To his team gave a whistle
An' away they all flew
Like the down of a thistle

But I heard him exclaim
As he drove out of sight
And quot, Happy Christmas to all
And to all a goodnight and quot

Hm
",'Twas the Night Before Christmas
Perry Como,"When I was but a youngster
Christmas meant one thing,
that I'd be getting lots of toys that day

I learned a whole lot different 
when Mother sat me down 
and taught me to spell 'Christmas' this way: 
 
'see' is for the Christ child, born upon this day
'H' for herald angels in the night
'are' means our Redeemer
'I' means Israel 
'S' is for the star that shone so bright 
'T' is for three wise men, they who travelled far 
'M' is for the manger where He lay 
'A' 's for all He stands for 
'S' means Shepard's came 
 
And that's why there's a Christmas day! 
And that's why there's a Christmas day!

With a corncob pipe and a button nose, 
And two eyes made of coal. 
 
Frosty the Snowman, 
Is a fairytale, they say.
He was made of snow, 
But the children know 
How he came to life one day. 
 
There must have been some magic in 
That old silk they found,
For when they placed it on his head, 
He began to dance around! 
 
Oh, Frosty, the Snowman, 
Was alive as he could be;
And the children say 
He could laugh and play,
Just the same as you and me. 
 
Frosty, clumsy as he can be 
See him lopping along!
Off he goes on an icicle spree 
With a happy song!

Knew the sun was hot that day,
So he said, ""Let`s run, and we`ll have some fun, 
Now, before I melt away."" 
 
Down to the village, 
With a broomstick in his hand,
Runnin` here and there, 
All around the square,
Sayin`, ""Catch me if you can."" 
 
He led them down the streets of town, 
Right to the traffic cop . . .
And only paused a moment, 
When he heard him holler, ""Stop!""

Had to hurry on his way,
But he waved goodbye, sayin` ""Don`t you cry, 
I`ll be back again some day.""

Perry Como,"When I'm alone at night, 
And there's no one to comfort me, 
I think of you 
And suddenly my pillow is your face and your arms. 
And when the winter wind comes chasin' after me, 
I think of you 
And it's as though I crawl beneath the blanket 
Soft and warm. 

How did I get from dark to daylight, 
Before you happened to pass by? 
How did I find my way through life, 
Before you brightened up my sky? 
Was there a sky at all, 
Until you painted it for me? 
How did I get on, 
'Till you came along? 

Who knows how many times I pause in every day, 
To think of you? 
As often as the sun sails out upon the silent sea! 
And if you're wonderin' why it is I only think of you, 
Well it's because I'd like to be as close to you, 
As you've become to me!

I've hungered for your touch
A long, lonely time

Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?

I need your love

God speed your love to me

To the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea

Wait for me, wait for me

Perry Como,"It's watermelon weather
That summer kind of weather
When people get together and sing

It's the time of year
The stars seem to dance with laughter
And the moon's so big and ripe
It can hardly climb

So, why don't you meander
To your best gal's veranda
And sorta, kinda, hand her the ring?

For it's the sweetheart kissin' season
And all the world's in rhyme
When it's watermelon sweet love tellin' time

This is the time to sing this kind of purdy little ditty
A walkin' along an' singin' a song and clinging to someone purdy
The type of a tune to go with the moon
That's sailin' along a way on high

After strollin' a while, for maybe a mile
Remember to stop and pop the question
If your timin' is right, your future is bright
As bright as a watermelon sky

And then when you found a bench for two
You found your cue to linger
The chance you sought to show what you bought
You happily thought to bring her

To cinch the thing, you give her the ring
You purchased from the five and dime

Take her in your arms and whisper
That you are mine all mine
And with that line to sell, I'm here to tell
That you'll do well in watermelon time

For it's the sweetheart kissin' season
And all the world's in rhyme
When it's watermelon sweet love tellin' time

Perry Como,"What kind of fool am I, who never fell in love? 
It seems that I'm the only one that I have been thinkin' of! 
What kind of man is this, an empty shell? 
A lonely cell in which an empty heart must dwell! 

What kind of lips are these, that lied with every kiss? 
That whispered empty words of love that left me alone like this? 
Why can't I fall in love like any other man? 
And maybe then I'll know what kind of fool I am! 

Why can't I fall in love like any other man? 
And maybe then I'll kno' what kind of fool I am!

And now you fill my daydreams too! 
 
Where you're concerned, 
When did this feeling start to grow in me, 
Where you're concerned? 
Why did it take so long for me to see? 
I can't pretend I'm just a friend, 
Where you're concerned? 
 
If love is just a game, then I can't play, 
Where you're concerned!
