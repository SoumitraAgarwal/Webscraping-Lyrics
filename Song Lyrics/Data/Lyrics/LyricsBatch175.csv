Ian Hunter,"Through the haze the mirror cries-hits you right between the eyes
You don't know-but you got the judas in you babe
You can't trust
You can't deliver
Always whinin' you were sold down the river
I gave you-the best years of-your miserable life

Where did you go wrong girl, where did you go wrong
Where did you go wrong babe-nice try, wrong guy
You're gonna wind up on your ass-you should have listened to your
Women's intuition

You can come (run)-but you can't hide-something messed you up inside
Ain't my fault-don't blame me-if you're dazed and confused
You're a lie, you're a television, tryin't drag into your prison
Had enough o'sleepin' rough-its over with you

Where did you go wrong babe
Where did you go wrong
Where did you go wrong girl
Nice try
Goodbye
You're gonna wind up on your ass-you should;ve listened to your
Women's intuition

Tarred by the same old feathers-guess we got to stick together
But I say to you-don't ever invade-my destiny
Bad enough I ain't normal, give up tryin't make me formal
What I need when I bleed
Don't mean nothing to you

Where did you go wrong babe, where did you go wrong
Where did you go wrong girl
Dumb moves, no class
You're gonna wind up on your ass-you should 've listened to your
Women'sintuition",Womens Intuition

Vestal Virginia, ain't got a bad thought in ya, you're a bastard
Mean as a killer, instinct that's within ya, you're a bastard.
Laughs like a drain and it messes up my brain
'cause you know I like the pain of never knowing
Space cow I'll chew the bad blood running through ya
Kiss you as you hit the floor 'cause you don't even know that you're a bastard

There's a crisis in the kitchen 
But that don't stop you bitchin', you're a bastard
You got that Yellow jacket touch, 
With the stings that hurt so much, you're such a bastard
Flirting in the shadows, aiming all those little arrows, 
You're as shallow as the gallows you got me in to. (yeah)
Voodoo dolls gonna line the room, handcuffs glinting in the gloom,
One day you'll find that hidden door, inside everyone screams that you're a bastard.
(you're such a)

You twist me til I'm lame, then you spin the coin again, you're such a bastard
You're so naturally perverse, you ain't even gotta rehearse, you're such a bastard
Fly like a witch, without running in some pitch
Why don't you break the switch that takes me over
My prison is your brain, your prisoner's insane
Forgot all the keys, you can break the chains 
But you don't even take the blame you bastard.

(Bastard, bastard) I'm enjoying that lately, you know just the beginnings 

(bastard)
The agony and the ecstasy meeting at the middle of my mouth
The agony and the ecstasy can't spit it out.
Sometimes on a rainy day I draw you.
Hope for love.",Bastard

Ian Hunter,"It was a cold, cold house,
I was a cold, cold room.
No one lived in me.
I was an empty tune.
Lovers came to view
'n' they looked all around.
But they couldn't see nothin',
Nothin but the ground, they really put me down
And then someone broke
Inside of me
And i found myself learnin'
How to fight free.

And it feels so good
When i can turn to you
'n' look you straight in the eye,
Say i need you, need you, oh i need you
I need your love, baby,
I need your love, i gotta hear your name
Over and over, over again.
I need your love, baby,
I need your love, i got you up my brain
Over, over, over again.

You know it hurts so bad
When you have to say
You ain't got nobody
And then one day
It makes you feel so good
When i can turn to you
And look you straight in the eye,
Say i need you, need you, oh i need you
I need your love, baby,
I need your love, i want to hear your name
Over and over, over again.

Ian Hunter,"When I was just sixteen - I stood waiting for a dream -
At barker street bus station every night
When I tried to get it on - she just looked at me with scorn - my courage
Turned to dust and I took flight

For those looks they seemed to say
You ain't nuthin' - go away
You're just a face in the crowd so I went home and I vowed
I'm gonna be somebody - someday

Her name was irene wilde - oh such beauty for a child
When she started dating boys - I nearly died
For I could not barely stand to see someone hold her hand
I felt I had to crawl away and hide
In my mother's living room I composed so many tunes
All the same - just a frame - for her name, and just to say
Gonna be somebody - someday

Wild as your name I soon left that country town
I been around, seen some fame, seen some ups and seen some downs
Smile through your shock when you hear your name aloud
It's that face in the crowd - didn't dig it - much too proud...

When I was just sixteen I stood waiting for a dream
A barker street bus station non affair
At the time it seemed so sad, but it did not turn out bad
If you hadn't messed me up I'd still be there
And I think most folks agree, a little put-down makes them see
They ain't no chain - just a link and that's why you made me think
Gonna be somebody - be somebody - be somebody - someday",Irene Wilde

Oh no, the fuzz, all in a line

And it's just another night
Yeah, it's just another night

Oh take it easy boy or it's DOA
Chrome on my body and a lot of folks say
That it's just another night
Hey, It's just another night
Oh, it's just another night on the other side of life

Head one's a saw-bones and he wrecked my chair
Said ""How'd you like to do it in a room downstairs""
And it's just another night
Oh, just another night

Hey now, Papa Joe, Don't you pull my hair
All this intrigue, it gets me out of my league
And it's just another night

But baby boy growed up just as stupid as him

Just another night
Just another night
Well, it's just another night on the other side of life

I never felt so bad; Where's my shades?

Ian Hunter,"Billy said this town is dying
It's dying just to be like me
He was fighting everything in sight
Died when he was twenty-three

I used to meet him down at his cafe
He had one eye on the door
And the other on the writing on the wall
He'd get restless and angry and we'd all laugh

'Cause we weren't really scared
We was his friends, he wouldn't hurt us at all
And all he'd say was rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain

Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain
We gotta leave this town

And glover was a dancer
Imitating Eddie Cochran by the jukebox
In the corner of the room
'Til he was lost

Barry'n me, we used to escape, playing I go ape
Wearing italian clothes, drinking cider, talking in the rain
Hey babe, come over here, let me buy you a beer, what's your name?
She said ""boy, it doesn't really matter, don't you see?""

You ain't what I want, you ain't what I need
You ain't what I fancy, you ain't what I dream of n'I'd silently leave
[?] you're ugly

Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain
I gotta leave this place

My history is a cop-out
Somewhere in the dark I got scared 'cause I knew I was gonna lose
You know that feeling you get in your guts, all that frustration when you know
You're going nuts

You gotta make a move
There was Billy and Glover and Pacer and Taylor and Valerie and Barry
I remember what he said about that town
He said ""I went to London once, came back

Wiped the tears from my eyes, looked out the window
And it was still pouring down
More of that rain, rain, rain

Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain

I'm gonna get a train
Never coming back again
'Cause if I did it would be the same
Boy, you really messed up my brain

Ian Hunter,"We walked to the sea, just my father 'n' me
And the dogs played around on the sand
Winter cold cut the air, hangin' still ev'rywhere
Dressed in gray, did he say hold my hand
I said love's easier when it's far away
We sat 'n watched a distant light

We're two ships that pass in the night
We both smile and we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night

There's a boat on the line where the sea meets the sky
There's another that rides far behind
And it seems you and I are like strangers a wide ways apart
As we drift on through time
He said it's harder now we're far away
We only read you when you write

We're two ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night

We're ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight

No it ain't Silver Needles on the run

All your plans were made on some PR floor
'N all your bags were packed, they never reached the door.
Out ordering (?) your thought exchange
All your brains were acting strange
You never lied in dreams before
There must be more to life than getting sore

(What do you think?)
I seen in some music paper that you was gone
And I went right out and wrote you a farewell song
Boy, they had you dead before you was born
And it's a shame - you were such a great mover

That's it baby, take one last look
We gotta go catch a plane
Then you won't die, and I won't die
But we won't ever be the same

Oh I can feel a mood coming down on me
Such a good thing disappears
I can sense the loss creeping up on us
And it's deeper than any tears I've known

You stepped into my dreams
You opened up the door
You stepped into my dreams
I want you back for more

You stepped into my dreams tonight

In the shadows of the night you're sorry
In the morning we was gone
Won't you blow a kiss to me baby
We both gotta be moving on

Sometimes you see a lover and she's made for love
But you let that lover slip by
You believe and yet she's so hard to get
And you never know the reasons why

She stepped into your dreams
She opened up your door
She stepped into your dreams
You want her so much more

She stepped into your dreams tonight yeah

Oh when you're doing what you're doing
What do you think of me babe
There ain't much else to say
In another time, in another place
Things might have turned out okay

I can feel a darkness I can never conceal
Sometimes I get just a little insane
I can feel emotions like the mighty oceans
They're driving me again, and I know

You stepped into my dreams
You opened up the door
You stepped into my dreams
I want you back for more

You stepped into my dreams
And I don't know what to do
I'm so scared of losing you.

I can laugh, I can listen to the children play

It?s going to rain, hope it don't rain on you
There's going to be a lot of pain before this thing is through
If Jesus was alive, he'd be standing on the M5
Holding up a neon sign screaming

Now is the time, now is the time

Now is the time, so many people can't see
They think that love is blind but it ain't free
There's a line, so many people have crossed and now
Their love is lost, say, ""Goodbye"", my funny valentine

Ian Hunter,"In 1935, I was living in paradise, I had a friend up in Cicero
We used to go out to the track, we'd knock a few whiskeys back
I'd lose my shirt and then I would lose my way home

I was driving my Stutz Black Hawk through Justice in the dark
When suddenly the blood froze in my veins
She was standing by the road in an incandescent glow
My heart stood still, my foot slammed on the brakes

She said, ""Please, please would you dignify my wish?
I'm trying to get to Heaven, could you tell me where that is?""
On a wild Chicago night, with a wind howling white
I caught my first sign of Resurrection Mary

I was trembling like a leaf, I was scared beyond belief
After all my conscience ain't that clear
I used to work for Mickey Finn, I did the numbers for Big Jim
Perhaps my day of reckoning lies here

I said, ""Please, please, I would dignify your wish
But when it comes to Heaven, I'm just a little bit amateurish
On a wild Chicago night, with a wind howling white
I cheated time with Resurrection Mary

And I felt tears form in my eyes for the first time, I felt something
Deep inside and the first time I saw angels high in the air
For the first time in my life, and I said, ""Mary, go to the light
It's gonna be alright""

I got down on my knees, I said, ""Sweet Mary, please dignify
These wishes before you run"", will you tell him I've reformed?
Will you tell him I'm reborn? She closed her eyes
And then she spoke in tongues

I said, ""Please, please, tell me what he said"", she said
""You must die the day before the devil knows you're dead""
On a wild Chicago night with a wind howling white
I waved goodbye on a wild Chicago night

Ian Hunter,"Well, I lay underneath an ageless sky
I watched the universe breathing
There's more going on up there than meets the eye
Give me something to believe in

Which way's in and which way's out
Every step is misleading
Well, which way is up which way is down?
You gotta have something to believe in

Oh, let me dream, let me dream
I spend my whole life dreaming
I've been lucky but I'm still mean
You gotta have something to believe in

I didn't mean to hurt the people I hurt
I was full of fear and loathing
I wasn't up to much but I was all I had to go on
Couldn't find nothing to believe in

I don't like all them man made religions
They all need a little spiritual healing
They don't cut across race, they don't cut across culture
But we all need something to believe in

So you believe what you want to believe
Just stay true to your feelings
'Cause one man's god's just as good as another now
Gotta have something to believe in

Well, I lay underneath a royal throne
The gaudy paint was peeling
Half an inch deep and twice as cheap
Oh, give me something to believe in

Fat Fred always packing lead
On the corner dealing
Makes more in a night than I can make in forty days
Give me something to believe in

Now people worship what they see
Looks can be deceiving
Violence rages in abandoned hearts
'Cause they ain't got nothing to believe in

The chill chill is a bitter pill
When it comes to leaving
'Cause there ain't no easy way outta here
When you ain't got nothing to believe in

Just woke up in Sarajevo city
I watched all those mothers screaming
Kids getting shot and for what and for what?
Give me something to believe in

Now there's fire outside, mud that slides
Earthquakes shake the region
Willy and the Poorboys lost in America
They ain't got nothing to believe in

For every seed of knowledge found
For every grain of reason
For every shred of decency
There's something to believe in

Now I lay me down to rest
In the silence of the evening
And the moon road shines from here to eternity
I've got something to believe in

You believe what you want to believe
Just stay true to your feelings
'Cause one man's god's just as good as another
I've got something to believe in
",Something to Believe In
Ian Hunter,"They say that some people never grow up
Lost in time, shackled to the past for ever, stung by love
Still weaving, still believing yesterday's dreams
If life is real then so is my imagination

All I feel is who I am? Who I am? Who I am?
And if I wished so hard I bled, would you come true?
All I need's a bottle and the memories come flooding back
And I see you though the rain, through the rain, through the rain

They say you can never go back
What if my love's still the same?
Still the same, still the same, still the same
Still the same, still the same

When love goes right, it's the ultimate high you can be on
Oh, baby, I've lost count of the times when things went wrong
Bit I pick myself up and I carry on, on, and on, and on, and on
And on, and on it goes

I can't pretend imaginary friends are better
All I know is people change, people change, people change

They say I'm supposed to forget and go on
What if my love's still the same? Still the same
Still the same, still the same, still the same
Still the same, still the same, still the same
Still the same, still the same, still the same
(Oh, baby, now)

What if your love, what if your love is still the same
What if your love, what if your love is still the same
What if your love, what if your love is still the same

What if your love, what if your love is still the same
What if your love, what if your love is still the same
",Still the Same
Ian Hunter,"All I ever wanted
Was to lose myself in you
All I ever needed
Was you to need me too

You're all I ever think about
I hunger for your touch
And all I ever wanted
Was you, is that too much?

I hate the pain of loving you
It happens all the time
I never needed anything or anybody
Until your eyes met mine

I'm waiting for your answer, babe
What's gonna become of us?
'cause all I ever wanted
Was you, is that too much?

It is too much to ask
That this man with a past
Could be happy at last
With a future like you

It is too much to ask
Is it too much of a task?
Am I going to fast for you?

Maybe you don't want me
I'm so scared of losing you
I never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity
Watch me screw up this one too

I'm leaving now, oh, it's just
And all I ever wanted
Was you, is that too much?
",Too Much
Ian Hunter,"Little flame tormented soul
Tried to get lost in all that rock and roll
Came crashing through here like some hurricane
Too much, too soon for you little flame

You can't walk on water
You can't walk on water, don't try
Like a lamb to the slaughter
Oh, but for the grace of God, go, I

Little flame caught that savage sound
He liked to turn it upside down
Well, I think I know what you were talking about
I'm just so sorry that your flame went out

Fun with no conscience, tracks with no tears
The rich get richer and the devil's got no fears
Sounds his call, political lies
There ain't no virtue without sacrifice

You can't walk on water

With the Body of the unknown soldier and the best of the brave
I have known you ever since I was a child
How come you don`t salute me - now - when I smile

You was always so young and on all o` that money
How come new mourners pass you by and think it`s so funny
I`d be there with you but I`m chained unto this stake
For I am loyalty but my mast I cannot forsake

I looked down on a bunch of amusements, I looked down walls
I`ve looked on hangings `n parades `n city halls
And I`ve seen love in so many living rooms
And I`ve seen rich men slowly die inside their tombs

I know we`re just two charms but it`s heavy on my mind
Have faith in me I said, now, look at time
I know you`re just a victim of your history but
Have faith in me, I said and you would be free....

You pull me up and you pull me down
And when the Queen`s in residence I hang around
I don`t wave madly `cos the climate`s civilised
Just flutter sadly `cos I`m old `n I`m wise

And you-you been up, and you - you been down

And you look at the things you'd forgotten to try
And you wish you were young and you wish you were old

For the songs always sung and the stories been told
And you thought you were different but what did it mean
For you tricked yourself trying, life's still unseen
As it is, as it was, as it always will be
Will you find out at all what it is to be free
See it never was easy to live with a head
So I kept to the back room and I live there instead
What comes from the front-room is only for friends
I have a bay window but that's where it ends

I walked the four miles to your door
You wore a straw hat, high heels to match
And the whitest cotton dress I ever saw
When I tried to hold you, you turned away
You don't have to tell me, it's all over your face
I can see the writing on the wall
And there's a distance in your eyes that says it all

Read it and weep
I can't get no sleep
'Cos I know you won't change your mind tomorrow
I'm sinking under, I don't wanna lose you
This emptiness is more than I can handle
You gave me no reason, but you gave me rhyme
I put the words to music and I was out of my mind
All I've got's the letters that I keep
And sometimes just before I go to sleep

I read 'em 'n' weep
You swept me off my feet
Now I know, time's the only healer
This jealousy hurts
The thought of seeing you with someone else
Cuts like a knife
Into the heart of me
[ Ian Hunter Lyrics are found on www.songlyrics.com ]

It twists and it turns
But I'll get over you babe

It's me, I didn't mean to wake you

Ian Hunter,"God said to me ""Gonna kick your ass - `cos all you do is ask ask ask 
All that energy looking for me when I`m sitting here inside you - plain to see 
How I built you cell for cell gave you sights to see - gave you tales to tell 
Even let you help yourself for a while - to take some weight off this busy child""

I said to God ""I found you out - I know what this world is all about!""
God said ""Stop - don`t scramble your brain - my opponent`s been messing you around again
See him and me are enemies and we play little games for galaxies
And he`s inside you - `n I am too - so here we are - just the three of you""

""Oh we made mistakes - too many cards - but making human beings can be hard
A God gets tired of playing so much chess - he wishes his God would get him out of his mess""
I said to God ""What`s it like to die"" He said ""It`s as plain as the sea and sky
Conception was him and me and you - when your batteries fade we all just move on""

I said to God ""Who`s winning this game - is the devil in front"" He said ""Is that his name
You know I`ve been so busy I never asked - I never looked up from this awesome task""
I said to God ""What`s good `n bad"" He said ""It`s just something you`ve got to have
It don`t mean nothing to us up here - but your primitive people - you gotta have fear""

I said to God ""Do I think for myself"" He said I told you once you just help yourself
Don`t forget you`re composed of three, your thinking comes from him and me""
I said to God ""How big are you, is there a religion - is it true
How big`s the universe - is time - the same for you as my life is to mine""
God said ""If all the things that made worlds float - were all to part - then you would note
The size of him and the size of me - and that`s how big we both shall be"" 

He said ""The universe is small - just like some fortune-teller`s ball
And we both sit down - and we play the game - when somebody wins it all starts again""

""There`s no religion - you did that - it helps to keep your little leaders fat
Like faith `n superstition stay - to help you pass the time away
But when you talk of time and life - it makes me think of circles, heights
Expansion is the clue - your dreams - are nearer than you`ve ever been"" 

""You see my little toy to think - is from two bowls of wine to drink 
Don`t take too much or you may drown - behave yourself - see you around...""",God (Take 1)
Ian Hunter,"Waiting on an elevator, in a hotel out in California
Smog clouds up in the windows, but there is a plaque up on the wall
That tells of the Agoras, people who were here long before us
Before the covered wagons, before they lost it all

They were hunters, they were fishermen und they often fought each other
But one small tribe was different, their leader was a peaceful man
They were weavers, they were painters, trading pelts for pretty colours
Protected by the warriors for the beauty in their hands
Roll back the years, roll back the years, to the river of tears

The chief he had a daughter, she was young and she was beautiful
He said, ""Go into the forest, get some berries for the dye
But make your way back quickly, for the old bear's getting hungry
I don't want you out there, when the sun falls from the sky""

Her basket filled with berries, she headed back toward the village

When a mighty roar erupted, she ran und hid inside a hollow tree
Shadows were getting longer, the forest was getting colder
And the chief began to panic, where could his daughter be?
Lost in the years, lost in the years, on the river of tears

In the camp the fires were dying when the old chief started crying
Soon all the tribe were crying, the ground grew wet beneath their feet
And the tears they turned to water and the water became a river
And the river flowed like an arrow, to the foot of a hollow tree

And the girl looked out in wonder, as she saw the water falling
She knew it was her father and she swam to his canoe
And all the tribe stopped crying, and the river started subsiding
Into the hill of the Agoras, and so the legend grew
Roll back the years, roll back the years
Roll back the years, to the river of tears
I wish all the world was healing",River of Tears

That I live by all the rules

Don't you take me for a fool

I, I ain't no angel
So good, goodbye love
Good, goodbye love

Seems I hurt her pride
And caused her misery
She never understands
To keep me satisfied
I got to live this life
The only way I can

All right then, come on

That I'll be down and out

Worth more than my love and affection?

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Barely clinging to their names

Nobody knew to sing
And nobody had the time
To talk about it anyway

Ian Rich,"All I wanted was a sweet distraction for an hour or two
Had no intention to do the things we've done
Funny how it always goes with love, when you don't look, you find
But then we're two of a kind, we move as one

We're an all time high
We'll change all that's gone before
Doing so much more than falling in love
On an all time high
We'll take on the world and win
So hold on tight, let the flight begin

I don't want to waste a waking moment; I don't want to sleep
I'm in so strong and so deep, and so are you
In my time I've said these words before, but now I realize
My heart was telling me lies, for you they're true

We're an all time high
We'll change all that's gone before
Doing so much more than falling in love
On an all time high
We'll take on the world and win
So hold on tight, let the flight begin

So hold on tight, let the flight begin
We're an all time high

Ian Rich,"Diamonds are forever, they are all I need to please me
They can stimulate and tease me
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might desert me
 
Diamonds are forever, hold one up and then caress it
Touch it, stroke it and undress it
I can see ev'ry part, nothing hides in the heart to hurt me
I don't need love, for what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone, they'll lustre on
 
Diamonds are forever, sparkling round my little finger
Unlike men, the diamonds linger
Men are mere mortals who are not worth going to your grave for
I don't need love, for what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone, they'll lustre on
 
Diamonds are forever, forever, forever

Ian Rich,"From Russia with love, I fly to you
Much wiser since my goodbye to you
I've travelled the world to learn
I must return
From Russia with love

I've seen places, faces
And smile for a moment
But, oh, you haunted me so
Still, my tongue tied young bride
Would not let my love for you show
In case you'd say ""No""

To Russia I flew but there and then
I suddenly knew you'd care again
My running around is through
I'd fly to you
From Russia with love",From Russia With Love [Instrumental]
Ian Rich,"When you were young
And your heart was an open book
You used to say live and let live
You know you did
You know you did
You know you did
But if this ever changin' world
In which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die

What does it matter to ya
When you got a job to do you got to do it well
You got to give the other fella hell

Ian Rich,"Where are you? Why do you hide?
Where is that moonlight trail that leads to your side?
Just like the Moonraker goes in search of his dream of gold
I search for love, for someone to have and hold

I've seen your smile in a thousand dreams
Felt your touch and it always seems
You love me
You love me

Where are you? When will we meet?
Take my unfinished life and make it complete
Just like the Moonraker knows his dream will come true someday
I know that you are only a kiss away

I've seen your smile in a thousand dreams
Felt your touch and it always seems
You love me
You love me

Ian Rich,"Nobody does it better makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, you're the best
I wasn't lookin' but somehow you found me
I tried to hide from your love light
But like heaven above me the spy who loved me 
Is keepin' all my secrets safe tonight
 
Nobody does it better sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Did you have to be so good?
The way that you hold me whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from runnin' but just keep it comin'  
How'd you learn to do the things you do?
 
And nobody does it better 
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you",Nobody Does It Better [Instrumental]
Ian Rich,"He always runs while others walk
He acts while other men just talk
He looks at this world, and wants it all
So he strikes, like thunderball

He knows the meaning of success
His needs are more, so he gives less
They call him the winner who takes all
And he strikes, like thunderball

Any woman he wants, he'll get
He will break any heart without regret

His days of asking are all gone
His fight goes on and on and on
But he thinks that the fight is worth it all
So he strikes like thunderball",Thunderball [Instrumental]
Ian Rich,"Meeting you with a view to a kill.
Face to face, in secret places. Feel the chill.
Nightfall covers me,
But you know, the plans I'm making
Still over see.
Could it be the whole earth opening wide
A sacred why? A myst'ry gaping inside
The weekends; why? Until we

Dance into the fire,
That fatal kiss is all we need.
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams.
Dance into the fire;
That fatal kiss is all we need.
Dance into the fire.

Just for you a view to a kill.
Between the shades, assassination standing still.
The first crystal tears
Fall as snowflakes on your body,
First time in years,
To drench your skin with lover's rosy stain.
A chance to find a phoenix for the flame,
A chance to die, but can we

Dance into the fire,
That fatal kiss is all we need.
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams.
Dance into the fire;
That fatal kiss is all we need.
Dance into the fire.
When all we see is a view to a kill.",A View to a Kill [Instrumental]

Time enough for life
To unfold
All the prescious things
Love has in store

We have all the love in the world
If that's all we have
You will find
We need nothing more

Every step of the way

Far behind us

Ian Rich,"You only live twice, or so it seems
One life for yourself, and one for your dreams

You drift through the years and life seems tame
Till one dream appears and love is its name

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone

This dream is for you, so pay the price
Make one dream come true, you only live twice

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone

This dream is for you, so pay the price
Make one dream come true, you only live twice",You Only Live Twice [Instrumental]
Ian Shaw,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Talkin' 'bout your troubles and you
You never learn

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,

Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.

Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall

Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old

Ages ago last night?

On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

Somewhere in Heaven you were fashioned for me,

Angel voices led me to you;
Nothing could save me,
Fate gave me a sign;

So I say merely,
Dearly beloved be mine.

Ian Shaw,"every night was long and gloomy
shadows gathered in the air
no one ever listened to me
no one wondered, ""should I care?""
none in all the world to love me
none to count the stars at night
then the moon came out above me
and I saw that was young

I wished on the moon
For something I never knew
Wished on the moon
For more than I ever knew
A sweeter rose, a softer sky
On april days that would not dance by
I begged on the stars
To throw me a beam or two
Wished on the stars
And asked for a dream or two
I looked for every loveliness
It all came true
I wished on the moon for you

Ian Shaw,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Pressed on your window, just waiting to shine

Getting faster by the hour

Ian Thomas,"It's an ocean, it's an ocean out there
That keeps all things apart
But there's something 
There is something out there
That's looking for a place to start

So touch me once like the rain on the river
Touch me twice and I'll know
Touch me three times and make it feel forever
Keep this moment alive and don't let go

'Cause it's an ocean, it's an ocean out there
An ocean of souls who've been denied
The constant, the one tangible reflex
The sense of touch that tells no lies

So touch me once like the rain on the river
Touch me twice and I'll know
Touch me three times and make it feel forever
Keep this moment alive and don't let go

We are the beings who have made
This distance between ourselves and wonder what is wrong
And now here we lie, waiting for a sign
And too afraid to
Touch is all, all is touch
Words may fall, but they don't mean much

Touch me twice and I'll know
Touch me three times and make it feel forever

Ian Tyson,"In a land the Spanish once had called the Northern Mystery, 
Where rivers run and disappear the mustang still is free.
By the Devil's wash and coyote hole in the wild Owyhee Range
Somewhere in the sage tonight the wind calls out his name.
Aye, aye, aye.

Come gather 'round me buckaroos and a story I will tell
Of the fugitive Claude Dallas who just broke out of jail.
You might think this tale is history from before the West was won, 
But the events that I'll describe took place in nineteen eighty-one.

He was born out in Virginia, left home when school was through;
In the deserts of Nevada he became a buckaroo, 
And he learned the ways of cattle, and he learned to sit a horse, 
And he always packed a pistol, and he practiced deadly force.

Then Claude he became a trapper, and he dreamed of the bygone days, 
And he studied bobcat logic and their wild and silent ways
In the bloody runs near Paradise, in monitors down south
Trapping cats and coyotes, living hand to mouth.
Aye, aye, aye.

Then Claude took to livin' all alone out many miles from town, 
A friend--Jim Stevens--brought supplies and he stayed to hang around.
That day two wardens--Pogue and Elms--rode into check Claude out, 
They were seeking violations and to see what Claude's about.

Now Claude had hung some venison, he had a bobcat pelt or two,
Pogue claimed they were out of season, he said ""Dallas, you're all through.""
But Dallas would not leave his camp.He refused to go to town.
As the wind howled thought the bull-camp they stared each other down.

Its hard to say what happened next, perhaps we'll never know, 
They were gonna take Claude in to jail, and he vowed he'd never go.
Jim Stevens heard the gunfire, and when he turned around
Bill Pogue was falling backwards, Conley Elms he fell face down.
Aye, aye, aye.

Jim Stevens walked on over;there was a gun near Bill Pogue's hand.
It was hard to say who drawn his first, but Claude had made his stand.
Claude said ""I am justified Jim, they were gonna cut me down, 
And a man's got a right to hang some meat
When he's livin' this far from town.""

It took eighteen men and fifteen months to finally run Claude down.
In the sage outside of Paradise they drove him to the ground.
Convicted up in Idaho--manslaughter by decree--
Thirty years at maximum, but soon Claude would break free.

There's two sides two this story, there may be no right or wrong, 
The lawman and the renegade have graced a thousand songs.
The story is an old one.Conclusion's hard to draw, 
But Claude's out in the sage tonight he may be the last outlaw.
Aye, aye, aye.

In a land the Spanish once had called the Northern Mystery, 
Where rivers run and disappear the mustang still is free.
By the Devil's wash and the coyote hole in the wild Owyhee Range
Somewhere in the sage tonight the wind calls out his name.
Aye, aye, aye",Claude Dallas
Ian Tyson,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Ian Tyson,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon

Tell me what you 
Hide inside

Ian Van Dahl,"Hearts can be broken Love turns into pain Eyes can be blinded Love fades away 

Why don't you see Why don't you see 

Hearts can be broken Love turns into pain So can you give me A reason to fall in love 

Words can make you cry When they say goodbye Why don't you see So can you give me A reason to fall in love 

To fall in love 

Maybe it's time to fall in love again Something about the way you look tonight Maybe it's time that I take my chances And open up my heart inside

",To Fall in Love
Ian Van Dahl,"People tell me one day I'll learn Someone will give love in return But all I can see, this picture of you 

I pick up the phone but you're not home I cannot believe I'm all alone 

I'm here calling your name 

I'll be waiting, waiting for you Don't leave me standing, I'm lost without you I'll be waiting, waiting for you Don't leave me standing, I'm lost without you 

I'm lost without you 

People say it's time to move on All those things, I've heard them before They will never know my feelings for you 

Good things come to those who wait Still it's so hard to keep my faith 

I'm here calling your name 

I'll be waiting, waiting for you Don't leave me standing, I'm lost without you I'll be waiting, waiting for you Don't leave me standing, I'm lost without you 

I'm lost without you

",Waiting for You
Ian Van Dahl,"Another sleepless night I open up my eyes I found the reason why 

I feel the time has come To make it on my own I'm heading for the sun 

I'm walking away To find a brighter day I'm walking away No reason left to stay 

I'm walking away [x4]

I still feel safe and sound But it's time to break new ground And turn my life around 

I've wasted too much time On things I could not find I leave this place behind 

I'm walking away To find a brighter day I'm walking away No reason left to stay 

I'm walking away [x4]

",Walking Away
Ian Van Dahl,"Did you ever mean the words you said That forever you'd be mine 
I'm trying hard to understand Why you left it all behind 
Now, the past just seems so far away But time cannot ease my pain 
In my mind I still see your face Why did it have to end this way 
It feels cold inside Without you by my side Searching for an answer A reason why 
It feels cold inside Without you by my side Longing for you day and night 
Now your heart belongs to someone else But still I'm hanging on to hope 
So many answers I can't find Why you left me all alone 
Time stood still the day you walked away Life will never be the same 
I wonder if you ever cared for me Or was I just another fool 
It feels cold inside Without you by my side Searching for an answer A reason why 
It feels cold inside Without you by my side Longing for you day and night 
Day and night 
Time stood still the day you walked away Life will never be the same",Without You
Ian Van Dahl,"Where are you now

Lie awake and wonder where you are tonight
How will I know
Search for a trace, I look around but you're out of sight
Where did you go

Thought your love for me was strong 
Was I the only one
I don't know where we went wrong 
Why did you leave me
Why did you have to go 

I had a dream last night
A dream about you and me
Love should last forever baby
Where are you now

Contemplate the promise you made you'd be my friend
Until the end
My heart aches, I'm in a daze, live in no-man's land
Where do I stand 

Thought your love for me was strong
Was I the only one
I don't know where we went wrong 
Why did you leave me
Why did you have to go 

I had a dream last night
A dream about you and me
Love should last forever baby
Where are you now

Ian Von,"Como puede ser verdad
 
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be

The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

Ian Whitcomb,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

And knew I shouldn't be
Made all the threats again
The pain is deafening

The jury couldn't win
And put the verdict in
Like many times before
They closed the coffin door

Turn it out if you wanted it more

If it was all wrong the first time
It's the last time

And all the children whined

Ib Glindemann,"Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,
But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon.

Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner.
Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.
Venus de Milo was noted for her charms,
But strictly between us, you're cuter than Venus,
And what's more you got arms.
So cuddle in a corner, any cozy corner,
Love is just around the corner and I'm around you.",Love Is Just Around the Corner

Too soon, too soon.

Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low

A fairy land where no one else could enter

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

A esa famosa región
Llamada perla sureña

Su mujer es un primor
Radiante como una estrella
Y por su elegante andar
La admiran en Cuba entera

Metido en mi corazón
Por eso con orgullo
Te doy esta inspiración

Alma mía no te extrañes
Si yo me voy pa'ese rumbón

No sé decirte como fue
Ni sé explicarme que pasó
Pero de ti me enamoré

Fue una luz
Que eliminó todo mi ser
Tu risa como un manantial
Llenó mi vida de inquietud

Fueron tus ojos o tu boca
Fueron tus labios o tu voz
Fue a lo mejor la impaciencia
De tanto esperar tu llegada

Más no sé
No sé decirte como fue
Ni sé explicarme que pasó

Surgió una sombra de odio
Que nos apartó a los dos

Y desde aquel instante
Mejor fuera morir

El camino que los sueños
Prometieron a sus ansias
Sabe que la lucha es cruel
Y es mucha pero lucha y se desangra
Por la fe que lo empecina
Uno va arrastrándose entre espinas
Y en su afán de dar su amor

Lucha y se destroza hasta entender
Que uno se ha quedao' sin corazón
Precio de un castigo que uno entrega
Por un beso que no llega
O un amor que lo engañó
Vacío ya de amar y de llorar
Tanta traición

Si yo tuviera el corazón
El corazón que di
Si yo pudiera como ayer
Querer sin presentir
Si es posible que a tus ojos
Que me gritan tu cariño
Se cerraran con mis besos
Sin pensar que eran como esos
Otros ojos, los perversos
Que hundieron mi vivir

Si yo tuviera el corazón
El mismo que perdí
No olvidarán la que ayer
Lo destrozó y pudiera amarte
Me abrazaría a tu ilusión
Para llorar tu amor

Pero, Dios te puso en mi camino
Sin pensar que ya es muy tarde
Y no sabré cómo quererte
Déjame que llore
Como aquel que sufre en vida
La tortura de llorar su propia muerte
Buena cómo eres salvaría
Mi esperanza con tu amor

Uno está tan solo en su dolor
Y uno está tan ciego en su penar
Pero un frío cruel
Que es peor que el odio
Punto muerto de las almas
Tumba horrenda y de mi amor
Maldigo para siempre y me robó
Toda ilusión

Si yo tuviera el corazón
El mismo que perdí
No olvidará la que ayer
Lo destrozó y pudiera amarte
Me abrazaría a tu ilusión
Para llorar tu amor",Uno [One]

IBU,"Silly dreams I wake.
It was just a memory of how we used to be baby.
Early in the morning you would always call me.
And say how much you've missed me.

I think about, the times we shared.
Girl I'd give the world to have it all back again.
Even though the seasons been passing by,
I can't seem to get you off my mind.

[Chorus]
I can't get over you.
No I can't get over you.
Over and over I've tried to say goodbye.
(No, I can't. No I can't)
I can't get over you.
No I can't get over you.
Night after night I've asked myself why?
(Why I can't get over you.)

What can I do to stop this madness inside?
Should I go out? Should I stay at home?
Just the thought of you with another guy,
Makes me lose control, I'm going out of my mind.

When we're together, you made me feel better than anyone could ever.
All the pain and troubles, just burst away like bubbles baby.
And when the seasons are standing still,
It feels like eternity in my mind.

[Chorus]

Ever since the day we said
Farewell my life's been filled
With silence, Can't deny it
Laws of love and I can't defy it.

Driving down to your house one day,
Trying to think of sweet words to say,
Then I saw in your eyes that look of demise.
Now I can't stop thinking 'bout the times we 

Made out by the fireside,
Had dinner by the candlelight,
Broke up and made up so many times,
All vanished in just one night. 

Now what am I supposed to do,
In a nightmare that I thought would never come true?
You used to say time heals all wounds.
Tell me why I can't get over you.

[Chorus:Repeat x2]",I Can't Get Over You

around in the day. But I cant shake these dreams,
show me life. Show me something.
Shamans curse got me breathing air again and
Im not in this body. Im not in this skin.
Soaking up large pools of memory.
Casual landslides and secret smiles as were crashing all the while.
Found a new way of life and now I never have to try.

It'll be a drive by homicide

He's getting rich, you his b**** and it's like that 
Now ask yourself 
Who's the mack? 
Who's the mack? 

It is that fool that want to pump the gas 
Give you a sad story and you give him cash? 
He starts macking and macking and you sucking 
Quick to say I'm down on my luck 

And you give a dollar or a quarter and he's on his way 
Then you see his sorry a** the next day 
Are you the one getting played like a sucka? 
Or do you say, ""Get a job, motherf***er""? 

Every day, the story gets better 
He's wearing dirty pants and a funky-a**ed sweater 
He claims he wants to get something to eat 
But every day you find yourself getting beat 

He gets your money and you run across the street don't look both ways 
'Cause he's in a daze 
And almost get his a** hit for the crack 
Now ask yourself 

Who's the mack? 
Who's the Mack? 

Is it that n**** in that club asking 
Have you ever been in a hot tub? 
I know the game so I watch it unfold 
When I see the boy pinned to your earlobe 

He's talking s*** and you crack a smile 
When he tell you that he can go buck wild 
For a girl like you and make it feel good 
You know it's drama but it sound real good 

He started dragging and hopefully he can start tagging 
The p**** so he can keep bragging 
He say, ""I'm 'a leave baby, can you go with me?"" 
The p**** so he can keep bragging 

You want to do it but you feeling like a H-O-E 
You grab his hand, you leave and it's over 
'Cause the n**** ain't nothing but a rover 
Ya knew the game and you still ended up on your back 

Now ask yourself 
Who's the Mack? 
Macking is the game and everybody's playing 
And as long as you believe what they saying 

Consider the a M.A.C.K. and with no delay 
They are gonna get all the play 
But when it comes to me, save the drama for your momma 
It's Ice Cube and you know that I'm a 

Mack in my own right 
When it comes to rhyme and rap 
'Cause all I do is kick facts 
Unlike Iceberg Slimm 

And all of them be claimin' be P.I.M.P. 
No, I'm not going out that way 
I'm just a straight up N I double G A 
Next time you get over on a fool 

And you did the s*** like real smooth 
Thank Ice Cube for giving up the facts 
And ask yourself

Ice Cube,"Now the taste of alcohol is filling up my bladder 
What's the date and time it don't matter 
Had a pocket full of phone numbers I was trying to sort 
To make a long story short 
Ran into this girl named Carla 
Knew her from the back seat of my homie's Impala 
She said what's up yeah what's the deal 
Check the hairdo of course it ain't real 
Then I looked down she was fat in the front 
I asked how long, well about seven months 
Oh how time flies when you're having fun 
She said yeah but the damage is done 
Where you been, on a little vacation 
Oh by the way congratulations 
Who's the lucky man? I don't have a clue 
Then she said the lucky man is you 
I dropped my brew 
And everything looked fuzzy 
Not a baby by you the neighborhood hussy 
She said yeah remember that date 
I thought back and tried to calculate 
Then I said damn are you sure it's mine 
Cause I know you been tossed plenty of times 
She said that day no I wasn't whoring 
Your ass is mine that's when the sweat started pouring 
Cause all I saw was Ice Cube in court 
Paying a gang on child support 
Then I thought deep about giving up the money 
What I need to do is kick the bitch in the tummy 
Naw cause then I'd really get faded 
That's murder one cause it was premeditated 
So what I'm a do 
I don't have a clue 
How many months left damn only two 
I'm gettin' faded 

No cigar, G 
Ay yo homey man I'm getting faded 

It's crazy cause before I could sleep with her 
I had to duck and dodge and try to creep with her 
See the booty and the front was all in place 
But the girl had the pitbull face 
So we ran jumped drove swam crawled hid 
Oh lord god forbid 
My homies see me at the motel 
Cause those fools would love to just go tell 
Everybody in the hood that knows your rep 
So jump in the back seat and quiet is kept 
And hold your big fat butt steady 
Cause yo hoe I got the paper bag ready 
She started moaning and gobbling like a turkey 
I knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque 
I dropped her off man and I'm knowing 
That I'm a hate myself in the morning 
I got drunk to help me forget 
Yo another day another hit shit 
I'm gettin' faded 

Ay yo you know what time it is 

Nine months later she's ready to drop the load 
And everybody in the hood already knows 
It's supposed to be mine so they laughing at me 
You know Ice Cube can't be having that G 
I'm thinking to myself why did I bang her 
Now I'm in the closet looking for the hanger 
JD and Jinx and T-Bone won't let up they won't shut up 
I'm gettin' fed up bitch 
Cause I know you're tryin' to break me 
But if I find out your tryin' to fake me 
I'm a buff that duff for a hoot 
Beat ya down and leave a crown or two 
That night she went into labor 
And the shit is getting kinda major 
The baby came out damn it was a lifesaver 
Looking like my next-door neighbor 
She said it was mine that was her best guess 
But let's check the results of the blood test 
I started smiling yeah cause it read negative 
Damn why did I let her live
After that I should've got the gat 
And bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap 
But no I just told the hoe who laid me 
Excuse me bitch it's a switch 
You can't fade me 

Naw baby not this way 
Yo you ain't playing Ice Cube out like no booger 
I don't fall for the okey-doke 
And before I fall for the okey-doke 
I let the pistol smoke 
Now sing it 
Yeah baby you can't fade me

Ice Cube,"Ice Cube with The Lench Mob I got it goin' on
A nigga that's livin' in the city of the criminal zone
One time can't keep the law in order
'Cause everybody's goin' crazy for a quarter
You're tuned in to the number one crew in the area
The way I'm talkin I'm scarin' ya
I'm darin ya to raise hell and bail and brag and sag
Or beat down for ya flag
'cause if you is or you ain't a gang banger
Keep one in the chamber
'cause you'll get them things put on ya son
Ice Cube has got the 4-1-1
All the ol' school house fellows are crooks
So I get jealous looks
They keep thinkin' did my hair grow?
Will the boys 'n' the hood have to beat down Ice Cube?
Hell no, I'll static son, you'll see it's okay
I keep my 9 anyway
For the day one of my homies want to squab
I'm still rollin wit The Lench Mob

(AmeriKKKa's most wanted)

Back in the day I dip my shirt in dirt
Sometimes I got away clean, sometimes people got hurt
But if you know me, you know that I'm liable
To bust a cap 'cause it's all about survival of the fittest
I'm a menace crook
I did so much dirt I need to be in the Guinness Book
From the shit I took from people
I reap all your fat shit, jack
Back to the criminals sect
I leave crew after crew but they can't catch me yet
'cause I'm slick as slippery
They can't get wit me, cops ain't shit to me
I can't dig a pig so I drop the dogs
And sweat em like sweat hogs
And get mad, mad 'cause I'm the nigga that flaunt it
AmeriKKKa's most wanted

Hey yo, here's what the poster read:
'Ice Cube is wanted dead'
That's all it said
I put heads to bed and fled the scene wit all the green
Hear shots and si-reens
When I feet first they yo' rings, now they my rings
So give it up punk and then I just
Put another jack in progress
It's the American way
'cause I'm the G-A-N-G-S-T-A
Ice Cube, a motherfuckin' clepto'
And tried to catch the early bird but they slept, so
Who gets the worm?
And if I'm caught in a trap
You know I'ma beat the wack
With a payoff, cop gotta lay off
FBI on my dick, stay off!
I'm not a rebel or a renegade on a quest
I'm a nigga with a 'S' on his chest
So get the Kryptonite 'cause I'm a rip tonight
'cause I'm scarin' ya, wanted by America

(Hey yo Cube man, they on your ass)

Word, but who the fuck has heard?
It's time to take a trip to the suburbs
Let em see a nigga invasion
Point blank for the Caucasian
Cock the hammer then crackle, smile
Take me to your house, pal
Got to the house, my pockets got fat, see
Crack the safe, got the money and the jewelry
Three weeks later, I'm at the P-A-D
Had a little fly ass bitch wit me
Sittin' in a dig, yo it couldn't be
(What up G?) Saw my face on TV
Damn (oh shit!) I didn't know I lucked out
Struck out, I gotta get the fuck out
Pack my bags and tried to hit the dough when
The ol' bitch down the street must've turned me in
'Cause the feds was out there ten deep
I got hassled and gaffled in the back seat
I think back when I was robbin' my own kind
The police didn't pay it no mind
But when I start robbin' the white folks
Now I'm in the pen wit the soap-on-a-rope

Too much knowledge kicked then you're lost 
In a shuffle of feet  Jinx the fiddler 
And I control your mind like Hitler 
You bow and vow to authority 
See now  a sucker with a style just boring me 
So I show K.N.O.W. 
L.E.D.G.E. it might trouble you 
Then I transform like a Deception 
With a mic as a bomb 
In my right palm 
But I don't stay calm 
So panic 
Others can't flow so they go schizophrenic 
You thought I dropped a dud in your face 
Until you taste the blood of the bass 
Then you faint, or better yet pass out 
When I'm on the mic, believe it's ass out 
You think you're raw so you draw 
You lose, you're hung, you bite your tongue 
The whole town saw in awe as you strangle 
A noose on your neck, and you dangle 
From side to side in the blazing heat 
You're beat, you're dead, the fools fell off 
You feel you're turning red, it's said 
That your head burst 
And this is only the first verse 
Of the bomb 

Don't break up the fight let them rumble 
Over the years I've watched some go super-bad quick 
Now the smell of the pen has got them sick to the stomach 
Now ask yourself, who's stupid? 
I take funky funky beats and I loop it 
And pimp slap you in the face with the bass 
And the boom from the bomb that I drop 
Stop 
You have a flat top as a fashion 
I love Black women with a passion 
But when they gotta go and show their ass in 
I gotta clown the hoes, yeah 
You gotta watch the ones with the big derrieres 
They'll steer you wrong 
Ice Cube's got it going on, hit me 
For the gangster boogie two times for the gangster rhyme 
The system ain't wholesome 
They want to put a young brother in Folsom 
And others see me on lockdown 
But I come up foul then they get knocked out, word 
To the brother that rolls the herb 
Everybody getting knocked to the curb like that 
Jinx got the gat, and it's a fact 
He'll kick a funky beat to peel your cap 
Now who's the mack? 
Who's the hoe?

It's the hip-hopper that don't like coppers 
And if you try to upset the pot son 
You get kicked in the chest like a shotgun 
I make the beats, I make the breaks 
I make the rhymes that make you shake

Ice Cube,"Peace don't make me laugh!
All I hear is motherfuckers rappin' succotash
Livin' large, tellin' me to get out the gang
I'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigger
How the fuck do you figure?
That I can say peace and the gunshots will cease?
Every cop killer goes ignored
They just send another nigga to the morgue
A point scored- they could give a fuck about us
They rather catch us with guns and white powder
If I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me
Since I'm young, they consider me the enemy
They kill ten of me to get the job correct
To serve, protect, and break a niggas neck
Cause I'm the one with the trunk of funk
And 'Fuck tha Police' in the tape deck
You should listen to me cause there's more to see
Call my neighborhood a ghetto cause it houses minorities
The other color don't know you can run but not hide
These are tales from the darkside

You wanna free Africa, I stare at yuh
Cause we ain't got it too good in America
I can't fuck with them overseas
My homeboy died over a key of cocaine
It was plain and simple
The 9mm went ""pop"" to the temple
""pop pop pop"" was the sound I put the bitch down
And ran to the schoolyard bathroom
Looked in the trash can yo it had room
So I ducked my ass in it for a minute
Covered with trash I had to lay back
Mad as fuck, thinkin' about the payback
Tonight the crew gonna have a little fun
I went home and cut the barrel of my shotgun
It's gettin' critical, I stole a 5.0
I let it go, drive real slow
I yelled out 'Ice Cube sucker'
The shot-gun kicked, and it murdered motherfuckers
I told you last album
When I got a sawed off, bodies are hauled off
Its a shame, that niggas die young
But to the light side it don't matter none
It'll be a drive by homicide
But to me its just another tale from the dark side

Standing in the middle of war
In the middle we flex
When we die, we won't make Jet
+Ebony+ can't see to the light side
The term they apply to us is a nigga
Call it what you want, cause I'm comin' from the coroner
Sayin my rhymes with a Ph.D.
Who's black, don't wanna role, sells his soul
Watch his head go rollin'
Who the fuck are they foolin'?
Nobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes
Matches the color of the one on my face
As they wonder whats under my waist
Standin' on the verge of them gettin' brown

Ice Cube,"Little boys and girls, they all love me
Come sit on the lap of I-see-E
And let me tell ya a story or two
About a punk-ass nigga I knew
Named Jack, he wasn't that nimble, wasn't that quick
Jumped over the candlestick and burnt his dick
Ran up the street cause he was piping hot
Met a bitch named Jill on the bus stop
Dropped a line or two, and he had the hoe
At that type of shit he's a pro
So Jack and Jill ran up the hill to catch a lil' nap
Dumb bitch, gave him the claps
Then he had to go see Dr. Bombay
Got a shot in the ass, and he was on his way
To make some money, why not?
Down on Sesame Street, the dope spot
There he saw the lady who lived in a shoe
Sold dope out the front, but in back, marijuana grew
For the man that was really important
Who lived down the street in a Air Jordan
Ride to the fellow Mister Rogers and hoes
Drove a 500 sittin on Lorenzoes
He broke out, Little Bo Peep, smoked out
Saw, her and her friends sellin' sheepskins

Yo yo I got them sheepskins
Yo, my empty sheepskins
Yo baby, what's up with that?

Hickory dickory dock, it was twelve o'clock
Cinderella ain't home must be givin up the cock
I don't doubt it, she is kind of freaky of course

But Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the story should go

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
With a joint, drinkin' some 8-ball
Three little pigs in a Coup de Ville
Lookin' for, the wolf to kill
They're fucked up and they want revenge
Them and Humpty used to be friends
Now they're enemies cause he's a traitor
Pulled out the Uzi cruised by and sprayed him
Cinderella hoeing for the fellas
And Mister Rogers is gettin' mighty jealous
Of the cash that the pigs were makin'
Time for the pigs to get turned to bacon
Cause Mister Rogers found out quick
That Humpty Dumpty was blown to bits
They said that the motherfuckin' wolf was next
So Mister Rogers better watch his step
So he let the wolf know
We're gonna fuck up the pigs, and take their ho
Cause Cinderella is much too fast
Before twelve, givin' up ass
Double barrels all loaded and cocked
As soon as they show, they gonna get popped
They bailed down Sesame Street and caught em
Little Boy Blue is up front givin' orders
Little did they know Cinderella was a fink

I missed that pussy and I bust a spread 
I tried it again in a thumping wagon 
The bottom fell out and her ass started dragging 
Tried it again and I failed to grasp 
I missed that pussy and I bust my ass

She didn't get offended it was splendid to me 
Cause mister nice guy is what I pretended to be 
I guess I just wine her and dine her 
And by the end of the night I'll be behind her 
Waxing that ass like Rain Dance 
On the bumper get the pussy then I dump her 
Took her to the Comfort Inn 
Tucked her in

First of all let me tell you my name it's Yo-Yo
When down on a girl first the fist and that's a no-no
Yo-Yo thinks the kitchen sink should be thrown in
Niggas be scheming and fiending to stick the bone in
No, Yo-Yo's not a hoe or a whore
And if that's what you're here for
Exit through the door
There's more
To see of me but you're blind so
Women like me are fading brothers in the 9-0

Ay what up buttercupper Miss Yo-Yo
I know you like to rap and like to flow so
But when it comes to hip-hop this is a man's world
Stay down and play the playground you little girl

What you're saying I don't consider it as rapping
Cause you're on rewind and I'm the new what's-happening
It never fails I'll always get respect
And you lose so take a rain check

Hell no cause you know that I'm first and you're second
If it wasn't for me you probably be pregnant
And barefoot complaining that your back is aching
Shaking and faking while I'm bringing home the bacon

Well you're mistaken
It's not going that far
I make brothers like you play the back yard
You used to flow with the title but I took it
Bring home the bacon but find another hoe to cook it

Damn it look it
Cause you're talking a lot of bull

Well I'm not your puppet so don't even try to pull

This is a man's world thank you very much

But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch

Ah Miss Yo-Yo so what gives
I hear females always talkin about women's lib
Well get your own crib
And stay there
Instead of having more babies for the welfare
Cause if you don't I'll label you a gold digger
The name is Ice Cube you know that I ain't the nigga
For you to look at when your hair get nappy
So take a piece of the pole and be happy

Hell no because to me you're not a thriller
You come in the room with your three-inch killer
Thinking you can do damage to my backbone
Leave your child in the yard until it's full-grown
I'm a put it like this my man
Without us your hand would be your best friend
So give us credit like you know you should
If I don't look good you don't look good

I doubt it baby cause we're still most dominant

But you don't know how funky that I can get

This is a man's world thank you very much

But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch

Man women I put a lot of fear in em
Cause I had it up to here with em
Drink a beer with em
No way cause I can only deal with em about an hour every day
Yeah if you know what I mean baby

Well I guess now that I think about it I think maybe
If you was more of a man instead of faking it
Women deserve the credit when they're making it

Yeah so what's the problem

Well I think we solved it
I know they know the best male from who's doggin it

Yeah I admit you can flow

Well that's true

But you see I'm a pro with the bank too

Yeah I can see you got it good

Oh that I know

But you see you're not better than Yo-Yo
The brand-new intelligent black lady

You're kinda dope but you still can't fade me

So what up then

Girl what you tryin to do

To prove a black woman like me can bring the funk through

They try to keep me from running up
I never tell you to get down it's all about coming up

So you better duck away run and hide out

When I'm shooting let's see who drop

They say keep em on gangs and drugs

Fake it ain't about how right or wrong you live
But how long you live

Don't want to sleep so I keep popping No-Doz
And tell the young people what they gotta know
Cause I hate when niggas gotta live low

Just call it train cause the bitches look like hoes
I see a lotta others damn

I don't want to see no dancing

I'm a tell T-Bone to pass the bottle
And don't give me that shit about role model
It ain't wise to chastise and preach
Just open the eyes of each
Cause laws are made to be broken up
What niggas need to do is start loc'ing up
And build mold and fold they self into shape

Ice Cube,"Once upon a time in the projects, yo
I damn near had to wreck a ho
I knocked on the door - ""who is it?""
It's ice cube, come to pay a little visit to ya
And what's up with the niggas in the parking lot
She said fuck em, cause they get sparked alot
I sat on the couch but it wasn't stable
And then I put my nikes on the coffee table
Her brother came in he's into gangbangin'
Cause he walked up and said ""what set you claimin""
I don't bang I write the good rhymes
The whole scenery reminded me of good times
I don't like to feel that I'm put in a rut
By a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up
He threw up a set and then he was gone
I'm thinkin' to myself, won't this bitch bring her ass on
Her mother came in with a joint in her mouth
And fired up the sess it was sess no doubt
She said please excuse my house and all that
I said yeah cause I was buzzed from the contact
Lookin' at a fucked up black and white
Her mom's bitchin' cause the county check wasn't right
She had another brother that was three years old
And had a bad case of the runny nose
He asked me who I was then I had to pause
It smelled like he took a shit in his little drawers
I saw her sister that needs get her ass kicked
Only thirteen and already pregnant
I grabbed the forty out the bag and took a swig
Cause I was getting overwhelmed by bebe kids
They were runnin and playin and cursin and yellin
And tellin and look at this young punk bailin
I heard a knock on the door without the password
And her mom's got the 12 guage mossberg
The nigga said ""yo, what's for sale""
And the bitch came out with a bag of ya-yo
She made the drop and got the 20 dollars
From a smoked out fool with ring around the collar
The girl I was waiting for came out
I said bitch I didn't know this was a crack house
I got my coat and suddenly
The cop busted in and had a mac-10 pointed to my dome
And I said to myself once again it's on
He threw me on the carpet and wasn't cuttin no slack
Jumped on my head and put his knee in my back
First he tried to slap me up, wrap me up, rough me up
They couldn't do it so they cuffed me up
I said fuck how much abuse can a nigga take
Hey yo officer you're making a big mistake
Since I had on a shirt that said I was dope
He thought I was selling base and couldn't hear my case
He said get out my face and musta had a grudge
His reply tell that bullshit to the judge
The girl I was with wasn't sayin nothin
I said aiyyo bitch you better tell em somethin
She started draggin and all of a sudden
We all got tossed in the patty wagon
Now I beat the rap but that ain't the point
I had a warrant so I spent 2 weeks in the joint
Now the story you heard has one little object
Don't fuck with a bitch from the projects!",Once Upon a Time in the Projects
Ice Cube,"You can't fuck with the criminal rapping over gangsta shit
First I load the clip and then I make the hit
I know some y'all can't fade this
Lench Mob niggas are the craziest
So you and your boys are ass out
When I'm rollin' in a seven deuce glass house
The Mob ain't nothing but a menace
When we get the motherfucking dog in us
Playing them old beats
I'm pouring out some of my beer for my homies
Ready to peel your cap
You can't believe ""Faces of Death"" on wax
Some say the Mob ain't positive
Man fuck that shit cause I gots to live
How I live and you could either give a fuck punk
Yo or get your ass bucked
Some rappers are heaven-sent
But Self-Destruction don't pay the fucking rent
So you can either sell dope or get your ass a job
I'd rather roll it wit the Lench Mob

To be down with the Mob is simple
Mind your own you want a spot find your own
And take mine if you're badder than the strong man
I do the right thing I do the wrong thing
Do anything cause I ain't faking the scene
It's all about how much bacon you bring
And if you see something from the gat I will stuff it
Yo you ain't seen nothing
Cause if you testify you're living blind
Cause in the city you live and let die
Rolling with the fools One Time can't beat
On my knees in the street interlock my hands and feet
He said ""I know you"" I said ""you might
My name is Ice Cube I did a song you didn't like""
So he soaked me up like Bounty
Had to do a week in the county
A piece of cake it was just like a party
Cause in the county you know everybody
No I didn't kill or steal or rob
Locked up for what cause I'm rollin wit the Lench Mob

If you know a female that's rollin with the Lench Mob
Watch your step cause the gat is kept
In the purse like my homegirl Yo-Yo
You gotta be down and you can't be a hoe no
Cause if you are I'll be the first one to bust you out
After my crew I'll be the first one to rush you out
Get the picture or bitch
You'll get the eighty-six
If she want to try and mix
Business and pleasure make up your own mind
You gotta be a hoe on your own time
Don't sleep cause even on a solo creep
Yo the Mob is still deep
And we'll play ya just like a nit-wit
You thought you got with the crew you can't get with
So get the noose ready for the lynching
Now 235 is what I'm benching
But nowadays it's still not enough
I got something guaranteed to stop the bum rush
Give me the gat, step back, and watch me do the job

What you're missing 
Personally I'm sick of the ass kissing 
What I'm kicking to you won't get rotation 
Nowhere in the nation 
Program directors and DJ's ignored me 
Cause I simply said fuck Top Forty 
And top thirty top twenty and top ten 
Until you put more hip hop in 
Then I might grin but don't pretend that you're down with the see 
And go and dis me in a magazine 
How could you figure the brother could dig ya

No it's not a threat but a promise 
I'm as 
Crazy as they come see 
Mama didn't love me 
All I got is my nine

Turn off that bullshit! 
Turn off that motherfucking radio! 
Turn off that bullshit! 
Turn off that motherfucking radio! 
Turn off that bullshit! 
Play the music motherfucker put the music on 
Damn!

Tune in to the radio listen for a minute 
Yo G stick a fucking tape in it 
Cause all the radio do is gangle 
That R and B love triangle 
If you're out there kicking it with the brothers 
You don't care about lovers 
You want to hear a young nigga on the mic 
Going buck wild 
Throwing and flowing and showing new styles 
That's where I'm coming from 
Reality that's what they're running from 
So if you're down with Ice Cube let me know that you know 
Yo turn off the radio 

You know what? You know what? 
Basically those black guys and those rap guys 
They don't know what the fuck they're doing 
I hate those fuckers 
I hate em

Ice Cube,"Fucking around in a crap game 
Niggas think I'm soft cause now I'm in the rap game 
And I don't hang out as much 
Bang out dope cuts 
Standing on stage and I'm grabbing my nuts 
But when it comes to getting in a circle 
I'm hitting sevens turning broke niggas purple 
Looking for Little Joe and the dumb nigga scream and choke 
When deuce deuce hit the floor yo 
Now which of ya want to fade the twenty? 
I'm turnin your fat pockets skinny 
Ah yeah I'm shaking the ivory 
And boom it's like they die for me 
Fool you can get loud, get mad, hit the joint 
But don't forget my point 
There it is yo 
I put my Nike on the bet so it won't slide 
Money gone cause I'm never hitting deuce-five 
I'm never hitting four-trey no way 
You want to leave but come on hoe stay 
Nigga see but that'll work 
Poppa needs brand-new shoes and a sweatshirt 
Fool you can't even fuck with that 
And now that I'm winning I gots to get my gat 
Cause I see your homies starting to look 
And broke motherfuckers they make the best crooks 
And I'm feeling like a baller 
Bucking fools now the circles getting smaller 
Now you want to go and scheme 
Punk niggas like you just love to triple-team 
So I pick up my money and start walking

Take that motherfucker",What They Hittin' Foe?
Ice Cube,"It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",You Can't Fade Me/JD's Gaffilin'
Ice Cube,"Up early in the morning  dressed in black
Don't ask why? 'Cause I'm down in a suit and tie
They killed a homie that I went to school with(Damn!)
I tell ya life ain't shit to fool with
I still hear the screams of his mother
While my nigga laid dead in the gutter(Shit!)
And it's getting to my temple
Why is that the only time black folks get to ride in a limo?
It makes me so mad I want to get my sawed-in
And have some bodies hauled in
But no, I pay my respects and I'm through(what up Cube?)
Hug my crew, and maybe shed a tear or two
And I want to get blitz
Grab my 40 ounce and then I reminisce
About a brother who had to be the one and only
So I dedicate this to my dead homies

Another homie got murdered on a shakedown{three gun shots}
And his mother is at the funeral, havin' a nervous breakdown
Two shots hit him in the face when they blasted{two gun shots}
A framed picture and a closed casket
A single file line about 50 cars long
All drivin' slow with they lights on
He got a lot of flowers and a big wreath
What good is that when you're six feet deep?
I look at that shit and gotta think to myself
And thank God for my health
'Cause nobody really ever know
When it's gonna be they family on the front row
So I take everything slow, go with the flow
And shut my motherfuckin' mouth if I don't know(Word!)
'Cause that's what Pops told me
But I wish he could have said it, to my dead homies

I remember we painted our names on the wall for fun
Now it's ""Rest in Peace"" after every one
Except me, but I ain't the one to front
Seems like I'm viewin' a body after every month
Plus, I knew him when he was yea big
Pour beer on the curb before I take a swig
But somethin' ain't right
When it's a tragedy, that's the only time that the family's tight
Lovin' each other in a caring mood
There's lots of people and lots of food
They say ""Be Strong"" and you're tryin'
But how strong can you be when you see your Pops cryin'?
So that's why Ice Cube's dressed up
Because the city is so fuckin' messed up
And everybody is so phony

Ice Cube,"I was told  cause I didn't witness the whole act 
In and out was the movement of the bozack 
It was hot and sweaty and lots of pushin 
Then the nut came gushin 
And it was hell tryin to bail to the ovary 
With nothin' but the Lord lookin' over me 
I was white with a tail 
But when I reached the finish line  young black male! 
One cell made two  and two cells made fo' 
And so on  so now I'm a embryo 
Then I got a hunch 
That I'ma be on lock down, for nine months 
Chillin', with my mother to guide me 
And nothin' but a stomach to hide me 
From all that worry and bullshit 
Nine months later, I elbow pull and kick

And you ain't gon' never be shit!"" 

I learned how to walk and talk and all that 
They put me in school, but it don't matter 
Cause I'm sittin' in history 
Learnin' bout a sucker, who didn't give a fuck about me 
They try to shape us 
But I know Uncle Sam is a motherfuckin' rapist 
So I stopped payin' attention

Fuck that shit, I roam the hallways 
I'm sent home and I don't got all A's

Gimme your car, run your jewels 
Makin' a livin' robbin' fools 
And if I let my nine rang out 
You know, it'll make your brains hang out 
So what's your fate? 
Am I the nigga you love, or the one you love to hate? 
The wrong answer is said, the nigga fled 
I pump lead, now he's in a puddle of red 
And if you got a buck, you're shit out of luck

Is it my fault, he was caught in production 
Where a young black life means nothin'
Just because, I didn't want to learn your grammar 
You say I'm better off in the slammer 
And it's drivin' me batty 
Cause my little boy, is missin' daddy 
I'm ashamed, but the fact is

Big Tom had to push us 
13 niggas runnin' straight to the bushes 
For they gats so they could draw down 
But why a motherfucker like me had to fall down

So now I gotta jet 
Only ran one block, but my shirt soakin' wet 
Tryin' to see if we got him 
Looked down at my sweatshirt red at the bottom 
Didn't panic but I still looked cracked out 
Yelled to the homies then I blacked out 

Woke up in the back of a tray 
On my way, to MLK 
That the county hospital jack 
Where niggas die over a little scratch 
Still sittin' in the trauma center 
In my back is where the bullet entered 
Yo nurse I'm gettin' kind of warm 
Bitch still made me fill out the fuckin' form 
Coughin' up blood on my hands and knees 
Then I heard ""freeze nigger don't move"" 
Yo, I didn't do a thing 
Didn't want to go out like my man Rodney King 
Still got gaffled

Now I'm laid out 
People steppin' over me to get closer to the tv 
Just like a piece of dog shit 
Now will I die on this nappy ass carpet 
One hour done passed 
Done watched two episodes of MASH 
And when I'm almost through 
They call my name and put me on ICU 
Halfway dead 
No respect and handcuffed to the bed 
Now the trauma starts 
'Cause the bullet must be just a hair from my heart 
Then I begin the ass kissin' 
Just to get looked at by an overworked physician 
Got the chills, but my temperatures 103 
Only got a band-aid and an IV 
That's when I start cussin' 
Police steady askin' me who did the bustin'

Now I pay taxes that you never give me back
What about diapers, bottles, and similac
Do I gotta go sell me a whole lotta crack
For decent shelter and clothes on my back?
Or should I just wait for help from Bush
Or Jesse Jackson, and operation Push
If you ask me the whole thing needs a douche
A masengel what the hell cracker sell in the neighborhood
To the corner house bitches
Miss porker, little Joe or Todd Bridges
Or anybody that he know
So I got me a bird, better known as a kilo
Now everybody know I went from po' to a nigga that got dough

I'm looking in my mirror so I can see who can see me
South Central is putting Ice Cube to the test
With four brothers in the SS
Now I can't go around and can't back up
So I gotta peep game laying in the cut
Is this a jack or a kidnap?
Since I'm never ever slipping I'm fully strapped
I grab my gat out the glove
Do these fools got a problem with me?
Or do they got love?
And  when the light turns green, I don't bone out
I want to see what these black men are all about
'Cause if it's my time, I'm just short
If not, I'm plugging they Super Sport
First they get behind my ride
Then they switch lanes to the left side
I'm scoping out the one smoking indo
Coming up fast, rolling down his window
He threw up a sign, I put away my nine
Fool, 'cause I'm color blind

Killer Cali, the state where they kill
Over colors 'cause brothers don't know the deal
And they'll cap you, not if they have to
But if they want to, first they might confront you
But every nigga on my block can't stop 
And he won't stop and he don't stop
Not to the bang bang boogie, but they like to gang bang
And rookies ain't the only ones that drop
Some say the little locs are getting a little too loc'ed
And when it comes to dust, they kick up the most
Say the wrong word 
Then whistle down the street to your homies like a bird
Bust a you-turn, come back and get served nigga
For the women, it don't matter how loud they blouse get
But men, the wrong color outfit, could get your mouth split
It's a shame, but it ain't no thang to me
'Cause I slang these things like a G
It's on, is anybody killing for the summertime
I gotta get another nine, even though I'm colorblind

I'm fresh outta county on bail
And no sooner do I get out, seems like I'm right back in jail
For some gang related activity
'Cause everyday, different fools try to get with me
For no more than a color, or territory
Can't rehabilitate 'em, that's the sheriff's story

And you ain't blue eyed

Because it ain't no sunshine where you headed
And the shit'll drive you crazy if you let it
But now, I got time to think
Because they hit me with everything but the kitchen sink
And I ain't even shed a tear
'Cause believe it or not, they got more love for me here
Now picture that, but on a black and white photograph
'Cause brothers, you don't know the half
On the streets I was damn near outta my mind
But ever since I've been down
I'm colorblind

Now here's the game plan, yo, at a quarter to nine
I was told to peel a cap on the other side
Yo, young and dumb, full of come up, a baby loc
I gotta put in work for the hood and that ain't no joke

Stable and able but I'm not ready and willing
'Cause I'm only 13 and I ain't never did a killing
Grabbed the A.K. and jumped in the G ride
Started up the bucket and headed for the other side

Yo, spotted the enemies, now I'm on a creep tip
Hit the 5 dollar stick and then I put in my clip

So, I jumped out the car and no matter what the cost
I had my mind set on sending niggas to Harrison Ross

Caught one from the back and I looked in his eyes 
Thinkin' should I peel his cap, or should I let him survive
Yo, I'm trapped in the plan designed by another side

I ain't contributing to genocide (why?)
'Cause I'm colorblind

Niggas in the hood ain't changed
And I've finally figure out that we're not in the same gang
'Cause, I walk the alleys of Compton with nowhere to turn
Every which way I get burned baby
Lou wears blue, Big Fred wears red
Put 'em together then we color 'em dead
Dead, dying, getting smoked like part of the fun
They get smoked just to show how many come to the funeral

I understand how all my homeboys feel
'Cause I was shot and to this day, I pack my steel
'Cause I was born in a certain territory
Where you don't talk only the streets tell stories
With blue and red bandannas on the street
And if you slipping, you'll be six feet deep
'Cause me and T-bone, we pay it no mind
And for the rest of the mob, we stay color blind",Color Blind

When I was young I used to hang with the seventh graders 
Little bad motherfucker playing Space Invaders 
Fucking with the girls in the fourth grade 
Either feeling on they butts or pulling on they braids 
Walking with the schoolhouse bully 
By doing that I had a lot of pull G 
Cheating on tests making a mess 
Cussing like a sailor at recess 
It must a been a half moon 
Cause you'll catch me running out the little girls' bathroom 
Chewing on Good and Plenties 
Got my gamble on at lunch pitching pennies 
Yo I was living like the class clown 
Pulling all the hokes, making all the jokes man 
When you young it's hard to see 
That it's wrong throwing rocks at the RTD 
Popping out your window with a BB gun 
Better yet knocking on your door and run 
Playing hide-and-go-get-it for a little stank 
Even though I was still shooting blanks 
As soon as the dark hit 
I was stealing candy out the corner market 
Until I got my ass whipped 
Cause I was ten years old, doing dumb shit 

Thirteen, that's how old I was 
When my jimmy started getting a little peach fuzz 
And I was looking at any butt and ass 
Me and my homies started cutting class 
Going up to the high school 
Looking for any bitch I could lie to 
Tell em I was older than I really was 
Smoked my first joint and got really buzzed 
That's what a mack's made of 
But when I got my first piece of pussy I fell in love 
Hard as a rock the long way 
And then I put the rubber on the wrong way 
But I still gotta have it 
Overexcited and fucking like a jackrabbit 
Goddamn I was hot 
A virgin but I still knew how to lay pipe 
Even though the hoe worked me 
I still knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque 
Then the shit got strange money 
I started shaking and jimmy felt funny 
Then the nut came gushing 
I jumped up got dressed and start pushing 
Cause I thought the bitch broke my dick 
Cause I was still young doing dumb shit 

At 17 got my first Volkswagon 
And mastered the life-long art of dragging 
To the women in college 
Hung out with the OG's and got some street knowledge 
Breaking in cars and all that 
Hitting punk fools with a baseball bat 
Fucking at a real fast rate 
Til they said that I might not graduate 
Then I said fuck the dumb shit 
Cause Pops'll fuck me up quick 
If things continued 
So I start rapping about shit I been through 
And I got real good 
Now I look at all the kids in the neighborhood 
Trying to be baby macks 
Doing shit that I did seven years back 
Going through a stage 
But before they can grow up they on the front page 
And they mommas is having a fit 
Cause they died young doing dumb shit",Doing Dumb Shit

And if you decide to call rape
We got the little hooker on tape, now
Tell the fuckin' slut to please hurry up
And wear that dress that's tight on her butt
So I can finger-fuck on the way to the bed
Been in so many rooms, she got a dot on her forehead
Face turnin' red from grabbin' them ankles
Fuck and get up is how I do them stank-hoes
You should hear how she sounds with a cock in her
Boots get knocked, from here to Czechoslovakia
Two are on top, one on the bottom
First nigga got the boots, man, you shoulda shot him
Cause after I got 'em it was over
Now niggas get lucky like a four-leaf clover

I wanna kill him, cause he tried to play me like the trick
But you see, I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
I got the A to the motherfuckin K, and it's ready to rip
Slapped in my banana clip
And I'm lookin'
Is he in Watts, Oakland, Philly or Brooklyn?
It seems like he got the whole country behind him
So it's sort of hard to find him
But when I do, gotta put my gat in his mouth

Cause he said he was down with the LM
He gave up a little dap
Then turned around, and pulled out a gat
I knew it was a caper
I said, ""Please don't kill my mother"", so he raped her
Tied me up, took me outside
And I was thrown in a big truck
And it was packed like sardines
Full of niggas, who fell for the same scheme
Took us to a place and made us work
All day and we couldn't have shit to say
Broke up the families forever
And to this day black folks can't stick together

Broke us down, made us pray to his God

And hang me by a rope till my neck snapped

And put me under dirt or concrete

Cause you the devil in drag
You can burn your cross well I'll burn your flag
Try to give me the HIV
So I can stop makin babies like me
And you're givin' dope to my people chump
Just wait till we get over that hump
Cause yo' ass is grass cause I'ma blast
Can't bury rap, like you buried jazz
Cause we stopped bein' whores, stop doin' floors
So bitch you can fight your own wars

So how the fuck am I supposed to make a knot? 
Police looking at niggas through a microscope 
In L.A. everybody and they momma sell dope 
They trying to stop it 
So what the fuck can I do to make a profit? 
Catch a flight to St. Louis 
That's cool, cause nobody knew us 
We stepped off the plane 
Four gang bangers, professional crack slangers 
Rented a car at wholesale 
Drove to the ghetto, and checked in a motel 
Unpacked and I grab the three-eighty 
Cause where we stayin', niggas look shady 
But they can't fade South Central 
Cause bustin' a cap is fundamental 
Checkin' out every block close 
Seein' which one will clock the most 
Yeah this is the one no doubt 
Bust a you Bone, and let's clear these niggaz out 

Hey hey man, whats up nigga? 
Yo, well this Lench Mob nigga! 

Now clearin' 'em out meant casualties 
Still had the L.A. mentality 
Bust a cap, and out of there in a hurry 
Wouldn't you know, a driveby in Missouri 
Them fools got popped 
Took their corner next day, set up shop 
And it's better than slangin' in the Valley 
Triple the profit makin' more than I did in Cali 
Breakin' off rocks like Barney Rubble

Los Angeles which are known for their driveby shootings 
Have migrated into East St. Louis 
Leaving three dead and two others injured 
No arrests have been made 
Police say this is a nationwide trend 
With similar incidents occurring in Texas, Michigan, and Oklahoma

Boom, my homie got shot he's a goner black 
St. Louis niggas want they corner back 
Shooting in snowy weather 
It's illegal business, niggas still can't stick together 
Fuckin' police got the four-one-one 
That L.A. ain't all, surf and sun 
But we ain't thinkin', bout the boys 
Feudin', like the Hatfields and McCoys 
Now the shit's gettin' tricky 
Cause now they lookin' for the colors and the khakis 
Damn, the spot's gettin' hot from the battle 
About to pack up and start slangin' in Seattle 
But the NARC's, raid about six in the morning 
Try to catch a nigga while he's yawnin' 
Put his glock to my chest as I paused 
Went to jail in my motherfuckin' drawers 
Tryin' to give me, fifty-seven years 
Face'll be full of those tattooed tears 
It's the same old story and the same old nigga stuck 
And the public defender ain't givin' a fuck 
The fool must be sparkin' 
Talkin' about a double life plea bargain 
You got to deal with the Crips and Bloods by hand G 
Plus the Black Guerilla family 
And the white pride don't like Northside 
And it's a riot if any one of us die

Who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain?
You're gettin' fucked real quick
And Eazy's dick, is smellin' like MC Ren's shit
Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to let a hoe be a hoe, so
I couldn't stop you from gettin' ganked
Now let's play big-bank-take-little-bank
Tried to dis Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
'Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair and I'll cut them balls
'Cause I heard you're, like, givin' up the drawers
Gang-banged by your manager, fella
Gettin' money out your ass, like a motherfuckin' Ready Teller
Givin' up the dollar bills
Now they got the Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say
'Cause he's goin' out like Kunte Kinte
But I got a whip for ya Toby
Used to be my homey, now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide-and-conquer
'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yellin' Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren, 'cause I remember when you drove a be 2-10
Broke as a mothafuckin' joke
Let you on the scene to back up the Verse Team
It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart
And they rippin' your asshole apart

Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half-pint bitch, fuckin' your homeboys
You little maggot, Eazy E turned faggot
With your manager, fella
Fuckin' MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me
Eazy E would be hangin' from a tree
With no Vaseline, just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on
Till that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation, off the Massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga, what you thinkin' bout?
Get rid of that Devil real simple, put a bullet in his temple
'Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a white Jew tellin' you what to do
Pullin' wools with your scams, now I gotta play the Silence of the Lambs
With a midget who's a punk too
Tryin' to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you

Better known as a deuce and we all wanna smother shit
Bent, front and back glass got tint
Tryin' to get our hands on some dollars and cents
And fools can't hold us
Every chance we get, we hittin' up the rollers
Comin' up short of the green guys
And I might start slangin' bean pies
Or the bootleg t-shirt of the month
With ""U Can't Touch This"" on the front
I'm 'bout to get rich
Cause life ain't nuttin but money and fuck a bitch
They drop like dominoes
And if you didn't know, Ice Cube got drama hoes
So after the screwin'
I bust a nut and get up and put on my white Ewings
I'm out the door
All you might get is a rubber on the floor
Cause I'm ready to hit the road like Mario Andretti
Bitch, cause I'm steady mobbin'

Have you ever seen such a sight in your life? (Steady mobbin')

Bustin' caps in the mix
Rather be judged by twelve than carried by six
Cause I'm gettin' major
Fuck Pac Tel, move to Sky Pager
Told all my friends:
Don't drink 8 Ball, cause St. Ide's is givin ends
Fools get drunk and wanna compete
Slapboxin in the street
Niggas get mad, tempers are flarin'
Cause they got a few bitches starin'
Just for the nappy heads
But scandalous bitches, make for happy Feds
I make it my duty to cuss 'em
Out, cause I just don't trust em
And if you tell on me I'm bombin' on Betty
Bitch shoulda known I was steady mobbin'

Have you ever seen such a sight in your life? (Steady mobbin')

Since one-time so hot
Got me a stash spot in my hooptie for the Glock
Cause I'm rollin' on rims
Eating soul food, neckbones from M&M's
Grumbbin' like a motherfucker
Greasy-ass lips, now I gots to take a shit
Saw Sir Jinx bailin'
When I hit a left on Ruthelen, ""Whattup loc?""
Don't you know that niggas get smoked
That take they life for a joke, get in nigga
I take you to the pad soon
Went to mom's house and dropped a load in the bathroom
Jumped back in my low rider
Comin' out feelin' about ten pounds lighter
Went to Bone's house so I can get the gat
Looking for the place where all the hoes kick it at
Lench Mob ain't nuttin but tramps
But hoes lickin' nuts like stamps
One fool brought the music for the yams
But Ice Cube had more amps, get in bitch
Cause I had the jam on
And I don't want to hear shit about a tampon
Give me the nappy and make me happy
The ho said 'Pappy could you slap me
On the ass hard and fast
And could please try not to leave a gash?'
I said yeah, but I don't play sex
Without puttin' on the latex
Slipped on the condom

Ice Cube,"It's the nigga ya love to hate with a new song
So what really goes on
Nothing but a come-up, but ain't that a bitch
They hate to see a young nigga rich
But I refuse to switch even though
Cause I can't move to the snow
Cause soon as y'all get some dough
Ya wanna put a white bitch on your elbow
Moving out your neighborhood
But I walk through the ghetto and the flavor's good
Little kids jumping on me
But you, you wanna be white and corny
Living way out
""Nigger go home"" spray-painted on your house
Trying to be White or a Jew
But ask yourself, who are they to be equal to?
Get the hell out
Stop being an Uncle Tom, you little sell-out
House nigga scum
Give something back to the place where you made it from
Before you end up broke
Fuck around and get your ghetto pass revoked
I ain't saying no names, you know who you are
You little punk, be true to the game

When you first start rhyming
It started off slow and then you start climbing
But it wasn't fast enough I guess
So you gave your other style a test
You was hardcore hip-hop
Now look at yourself, boy you done flip-flopped
Giving our music away to the mainstream
Don't you know they ain't down with the team
They just sent they boss over
Put a bug in your ear and now you crossed over
On MTV but they don't care
They'll have a new nigga next year
You out in the cold
No more white fans and no more soul
And you might have a heart attack
When you find out the black folks don't want you back
And you know what's worse?
You was just like the nigga in the first verse
Stop selling out your race
And wipe that stupid-ass smile off your face
Niggas always gotta show they teeth
Now I'm a be brief
Be true to the game

A message to the oreo cookie
Find a mirror and take a look, G
Do you like what you see?
But you're quick to point the finger at me
You wanna be the big fish, you little guppy
Black man can't be no yuppie
You put on your suit and tie and your big clothes
You don't associate with the Negroes
You wanna be just like Jack
But Jack is calling you a nigger behind your back
So back off genius
I don't need you to correct my broken English
You know that's right
You ain't white
So stop holding your ass tight
Cause you can't pass
So why you keep trying to pass?
With your black ass
Mister Big
But in reality, you're shorter than a midge
You only got yourself to blame

Ice Cube,"Could you tell me who released our animal instinct? 
And the white man sittin' there tickled pink
Laughin' at us on the avenue 
Bustin' caps at each other after havin' brew 
We can't enjoy ourselves 
Too busy jealous
At each other's wealth 
Commin' up is just in me 
But the Black community is full of envy 
Too much back stabbin' 
While I look up the street I see all the japs grabbin' 
Every vacant lot in my neighborhood 
Build a store, and sell their goods 
To the county recips
You know us po niggas, nappy hair and big lips? 
Four or five babies on your crotch 
And you expect Uncle Sam to help us out? 
We ain't nothin' but porch monkeys 
To the average bigot, redneck honky 
You say comin' up is a must 
But before we can come up, take a look at US 

Break em off some

And all y'all dope-dealers
Your as bad as the po-lice cause ya kill us 
You got rich when you started slangin' dope 
But you ain't built us a supermarket 
So when can spend our money with the blacks 
Too busy buyin' gold an' Caddilacs 
That's what ya doin' with the money that ya raisin' 
Exploitin' us like the Caucasians did 
For four hundred years, I got four hundred tears for four hundred peers 
Died last year from gang-related crimes 
That's why I got gang-related rhymes 
But when I do a show ta kick some facts 
Us Blacks don't know how ta act 
Sometimes I believe the hype, man 
We're messin' up ourselves and blame the white man 
But don't point the finger you jiggaboo 
Take a look at yourself ya dumb nigga you 
Pretty soon hip-hop won't be so nice 
No Ice Cube, just Vanilla Ice 
And y'all sit and scream and cuss
But there's no one ta blame, but US 

Break em off some

Us will always sing the blues 
'Cause all we care about is hairstyles and tennis shoes 
But if ya step on mine ya pushed a button 
""Cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin' 
Just like a beast 
But I'm the first nigga ta holler out (peace, black man)
I beat my wife and children to a pulp 
When I get drunk and smoke dope 
Got a bad heart condition 
Still eat hog-mogs an' chitlin's 
Bet my money on the dice and the horses 
Jobless, so I'm a hope for the armed forces 
Go to church but they tease us 
Wit' a picture of a blue-eyed Jesus 
They used to call me Negro 
After all this time I'm still bustin' up the chiffarobe 
No respect and didn't know it 
And I'm havin' more babies than I really can afford 
In jail 'cause I can't pay the mother 
Held back in life because of my color 
Now this is just a little summary 
Of US, but y'all think it's dumb of me 
To hold a mirror to ya face, but trust 
Nobody gives a fuck about",Us

I gotta have it, to peel his cap backwards
I hope he wear a vest too, and his best blue
Goin up against the Zulu
Break his spine like a jellyfish
Kick his ass til I'm smellin shit
Off wit the head, off wit the head I say
And watch the devil start kickin'
Run around like a chicken

Named Jack, he wasn't that nimble, wasn't that quick 
Jumped over the candlestick and burnt his dick 
Ran up the street cause he was piping hot 
Met a bitch named Jill on the bus stop 
Dropped a line or two, and he had the hoe 
At that type of shit he's a pro 
So Jack and Jill ran up the hill to catch a lil' nap 
Dumb bitch, gave him the claps 
Then he had to go see Dr. Bombay 
Got a shot in the ass, and he was on his way 
To make some money, why not? 
Down on Sesame Street, the dope spot 
There he saw the lady who lived in a shoe 
Sold dope out the front, but in back, marijuana grew 
For the man that was really important 
Who lived down the street in a Air Jordan 
Ride to the fellow Mister Rogers and hoes 
Drove a 500 sittin on Lorenzoes 
He broke out, Little Bo Peep, smoked out 
Saw, her and her friends sellin' sheepskins 

Yo yo I got them sheepskins 
Yo, my empty sheepskins 
Yo baby, what's up with that? 

Hickory dickory dock, it was twelve o'clock 
Cinderella ain't home must be givin up the cock 
I don't doubt it, she is kind of freaky of course 
Had a fight with Snow White, she was fuckin her dwarfs 
Saw a fight over colors, too

Now they're enemies cause he's a traitor

And Mister Rogers is gettin' mighty jealous 
Of the cash that the pigs were makin' 
Time for the pigs to get turned to bacon 
Cause Mister Rogers found out quick 
That Humpty Dumpty was blown to bits 
They said that the motherfuckin' wolf was next 
So Mister Rogers better watch his step 
So he let the wolf know 
We're gonna fuck up the pigs, and take their ho 
Cause Cinderella is much too fast 
Before twelve, givin' up ass

As soon as they show, they gonna get popped

Not guilty the filthy, devils tried ta kill me
When the news get to the hood then niggas will be
Hotter than cayenne pepper, cuss, bust
Kickin' up dust is a must

I can't trust a cracker in a blue uniform
Stick a nigga like a Unicorn
Vaughn wicked, Lawrence Powell, foul
Cut his fuckin' throat and I smile

Go to Simi valley and surely
Somebody knows the address of the jury
Pay a little visit, ""Who is it?""
(Who is Ice Cube?)
""Can I talk to the grand wizard?"", then boom

Make him eat the barrel, modern day feral
Now he's zipped up like leather tuscadero
Pretty soon, we'll catch Sergeant Coon
Shoot him in the face, run up in him witta broom

Stick prick, devils ain't shit
Introduce his ass to the AK40 dick
Two dazed niggas layin' in the cut
To get some respect we had to tear this muthafucka up
(Make it rough)

I gotta Mac10 for officer Wynd
Damn, his devil ass need to be shipped back to Kansas
In a casket, crew cut fagot
Now he ain't nothin' but food for the maggots

Lunch, punch, Hawaiin lyin'
Niggas ain't buyin', ya story bore me
Tearin' up shit with fire, shooters, looters
Now I got a lap-top computer

I told you all what happened and you heard it, read it
But all you could call me was anti-semitic
Regret it, nope, said it, yep
Listen to my big black boots as I step

Niggas had to break you off somethin', give bush a push
But your national guard ain't hard
You had to get Rodney to stop me 'cause you know what?
We woulda teared this muthafucka up
(Huh, make it rough)
(Huh muggs, make it rough)

It's on, gone with the wind and I know white men can't dunk
Now I'm stealin' blunts
And it came from Betty Crocker, overweight and blacker
Don't fuck with the black-owned stores but hit the foot lockers

Steal, muthafuck fire, Marshall Bill
Oh what the hell, throw the cocktail
I smelt smoke, got the fuck out, Ice Cube lucked out
My nigga had his truck out, didn't get stuck out

In front of that store with the Nikes and Adidas
Oh Jesus, [Incomprehensible] surplus got the heaters
Meet us so we can get the 9's and the what-nots
Got the Mossberg with the double eyed buckshot

Ready for Darryl and like beretta wouldn't say
Keep your eye on the barrel, a sparrow
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
But I'm rollin' so that's a fucked up slogan

The hogan's heroes spotted the gorilla by the sizzler
Hittin' up police killer
The super duper nigga that'll buck
We had to tear this muthafucka up, so what the fuck?

Huh, make it rough
Yo muggs, make it rough
Huh, make it rough

Today  how you like me now  I'm in the mix? 
It's 1986 and I got the fix with the chicken and a quota 
Got the baking soda  let the water boil  workers all loyal 
Dropped out the twelve'th 
'cause my wealth is shorter than a midget on his knees 
Now I slang keys 
Infest my hood with crack, 'cause I'm the mack 
Take a nation of millions to hold me back 
Too big for my britches, and I got bitches 
Now I'm hittin' switches, niggas want my riches 
Used to get 18 when my G was alive, now a key is 13-5 
'89s the number, another summer 
Police ain't get no dumber 
Streets dried up, used to think it would last 
But being a king-pin is a thing of the past 
They tried to blast me for selling a boulder 
Now I got my ass in Minnesota 
Got my own crew, it's on brand new 

Damn, what can I do?

Already done stack me half a mill ticket 
Bought a house next to Prince, so now I can kick it 
Now I got ends, wavin' to my friends, rollin' in my Benz 
Goin' to see the Twins, play at the dome 
Police are tappin' my mobile phone 
I'm almost home 
Gettin' excited, indited, spent a grip and a year tryin' to fight it 
Lawyer got paid, plea, no contest 
And everything I own got repossessed 
Now take a look at the dust 
And I'm happy 'cause I only got 36 months 
Never picked up a book 
But my arms are 16 inches, niggas look 
Can't wait for '92 so I can get with my crew 
And see, what can I do?

Fucked up in the pen, now it's ninety-fo

What you tell me? 
No it ain't crack, and everybody's jackin' for a coupe 
'cause, they sent in the troops

Looked out the window by the black bed 
I saw the pigs and the four on a flatbed

I close the blinds cause I didn't want to catch a case

while I was eating fish and watching Urkel 
She said I could sleep on the couch 
By two A.M. I was digging her out

Ice Cube,"In any country  prison is where society sends it's failures 
But in this country society itself is failing. 

Today  how you like me now  I'm in the mix? 
It's 1986 and I got the fix with the chicken and a quota 
Got the baking soda  let the water boil  workers all loyal 
Dropped out the twelve'th 
'cause my wealth is shorter than a midget on his knees 
Now I slang keys 
Infest my hood with crack, 'cause I'm the mack 
Take a nation of millions to hold me back 
Too big for my britches, and I got bitches 
Now I'm hittin' switches, niggas want my riches 
Used to get 18 when my G was alive, now a key is 13-5 
'89s the number, another summer 
Police ain't get no dumber 
Streets dried up, used to think it would last 
But being a king-pin is a thing of the past 
They tried to blast me for selling a boulder 
Now I got my ass in Minnesota 
Got my own crew, it's on brand new 

Damn, what can I do? 

Today

Already done stack me half a mill ticket 
Bought a house next to Prince, so now I can kick it 
Now I got ends, wavin' to my friends, rollin' in my Benz 
Goin' to see the Twins, play at the dome 
Police are tappin' my mobile phone 
I'm almost home 
Gettin' excited, indited, spent a grip and a year tryin' to fight it 
Lawyer got paid, plea, no contest 
And everything I own got repossessed 
Now take a look at the dust 
And I'm happy 'cause I only got 36 months 
Never picked up a book 
But my arms are 16 inches, niggas look 
Can't wait for '92 so I can get with my crew 
And see, what can I do? 

Today

Fucked up in the pen, now it's ninety-fo 
Back in LA, and I'm bailin' in the dough 
Everybody, now I gotta start from scratch 
So where to work at, and niggas smirk at 
Me say ain't nothin' poppin' from here to the LB 
What you tell me? 
No it ain't crack, and everybody's jackin' for a coupe 
'cause, they sent in the troops 
Even tho I got muscle, that ain't my hustle 
Takin' niggas shit in a tussle 
No skills to pay the bills 
Takin' 'bout education to battle inflation 
No college degree, just a dumb ass G 
(Yeah you Nigga, who me?) 
I got a baby on the way, damn it's a mess 
Have you ever been convicted of a felony? Yes 
Took some advice from my Uncle Fester 
All dressed up in polyester 
Welcome to McDonald's may I please help you? 
Shit, what can I do? 

Today

The white man has broke every law known to man to establish AmeriKKKa. 
But he'll put you in the state penitentiary, 
He'll put you in the federal 
Penitentiary for breaking these same laws. 
Now we gonna look and see if 
This motherfucker is guilty for the laws 
He'll put you in jail for 

Drug using, drug selling, armed robbery, strong armed robbery, grand 
Larceny, rape, racketeering, conspiracy to commit murder, extortion, 
Aggravated assault, mayhem, sodomy of the black man, trespassing, 
Embezzlement, purgery, kidnapping, smuggling, grand theft, brandishing 
A firearm, carrying a concealed weapon, breaking and entering, and

But are you talkin' to me
I can't hear you with a mouth full of pig's feet
If I should need the swine flesh
Your body is a mess, but you're blessed
With a father, son, spirit and the holy ghost
But my whole neigborhood is comatose
Lookin' for survival
The devil made you a slave and he gave you a bible
400 years gettin' our ass kicked
By so-called christians and catholics
But I watch 'em burn in a fire
See I'm a g, that's why I ain't in your choir
'Cause I see, cause I know
The church ain't nothin' but a fashion show
Get the devil to a 187
And they won't call me a nigga when I get to heaven

You're waitin' for the devil to come from the ground
Clown, take a look around
Just look at the cross that the priest is holdin'
A beast in sheep's clothing
But I'm rollin' with that knowledge of self
'Cause heaven ain't just wealth
So mister preacher, if I couldn't pay my tithe
Do I have to wait outside?
White man, please take another look
'Cause we couldn't be readin' out of the same book
'Cause youse a crook and I'm a brother

The same white man that threw me in the slammer
He bombed the church in Alabama
So if I cock the hammer, God won't mind
If I have to kill the human swine
'Cause God is a killer from the start
Why you think Noah had to build his ark
And God is a man from his feet to his hair
That's why you say 'amen' after each and every prayer
I just stare at the church man
Spendin' more money on the church band
But Elijah's got a plan
Got the white man screamin' 'Damn that Farrakhan!'
'Cause one day these babies are uprise
Much more than bowties and bean pies

Ice Cube,"Just waking up in the morning gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the do'
Thinking will I live, another twenty-fo'
I gotta go cause I got me a drop top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Looking in my mirror not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm asking y'all
Which park, are y'all playing basketball?
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week fucked around and got a triple double
Freaking niggas every way like M.J.
I can't believe, today was a good day

Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexing, didn't even look in a niggas direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watching yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps
Shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em
Roll em in a circle of niggas and watch me break em
With the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven
Seven even back do' little Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yelling domino
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.
Today was a good day

Left my niggas house paid
Picked up a girl been trying to fuck since the twelve grade
It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy, and killed the punanny
And my dick runs deep, so deep, so deep
Put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coasting
Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off, then I chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams
No helicopter looking for a murder
Two in the morning got the Fat-burger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read Ice Cube's a pimp
Drunk as hell but no throwing up
Half way home and my pager still blowing up
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K.
I got to say it was a good day.

Hey wait, wait a minute poo Stop the shit",It Was a Good Day [Remix]

It ain't nothing but hard time bailing
Just got a misdomener
Cause I got a deuce-five, and I'm black as Sarafina
Get the hell out Somolia, we didn't call y'all
I can't wait till I can kill all y'all
Fuck Reggie Denton and Jimmy (Johnny) Cochran
Damn I couldn't get close enough to sock him
I plead guilty your honor

Truer than the Mack but I'm downer than he is
And that police chief named Willie
Can take his motherfucking ass back to Philly
Dropped a bomb on a crew named ""Move""
Years ago, here's a hoe
That's ready to stop me, they think I'm Khadafi
Rolling in a six-tre jalopy
They want to give me ten in the pen cause I'm smelling like Hen

I don't know karate
But I can still beat the dog shit out of Nazis
You claim you want to put in work
Plotting to blow up a church
See you devils are all the same
You'll gun down a congregation in Jesus' name
Using me as a scapegoat, well cracker don't sleep
Far from a goat, more like a black sheep
Lamb of God, and it's odd
That Allah is a man that don't need a tan
And you can't stand when I talk like that
And why do black men have to walk like that?
Cause we swing low like a chariot
And now I got Harriet all on my dick
Cause my shoe size is much bigger than a motherfucking 10

Standing like a G pissing on America's flag
Dub C, the nigga from Westside
Westide Maad Circle bailing with a double barrel
Cause uh, my skin is my sin
And all I need is knowledge of self and ammunition is my best friend
When it's time to roll nigga, we ain't calling on Jesus
I'm calling Mad Dog for the 9 millimeters
Cause I give the song with those peckerwoods to the fullest
And a bitch by the name of America's on it
The same bitch that jacked my forefathers
And the Indians took my motherfucking religion
Place a holy Bible in my hand, but for what?
Like Jim Kelly said, ""You try to set me up?"" Shit...
I'm too slick for your lies in disguise
When will you devils open your eyes and realize?
Like Pepsi, niggas got a new generation
And we don't want your American education
Ain't no brain washing this way
Fuck America, Tom Meztger, and KKK
And to the cracker named J.B. Stoner
Don't let me catch you on no corners
I see you on TV talking more shit
But just like your punk-ass ancestors, you's a bitch
You's a bitch if I ever saw one
Grand Wizard bring your ass on Imperial so we can get physical
And watch God show and prove
Not only mentally but physically the black man rules
So run devil run, you's to best start running
Because the niggas are coming, oh, the niggas are coming
And ain't no way you gon' win
Cause I come from a tribe of O.G.'s and my skin is my sin

Ice Cube,"My job is to tell it like it is
See who the fuck I'ma jack today
Nigga broke, shit and it's early in the mornin'
Today I'm going to tell you the story of Robin Hood

At last, grab my ski-mask out the closet
Now let's see how big did my balls get?
I brush my teeth, it takes a thief
Swervin' 'cause I'm tryin' to roll up the chronic leaf

At a stop sign, I take a hit and hold it in
I cough, now I'm off
Drivin' down the two-lane highway
It's all bad, thinkin' 'bout shit I never had

Pass through the W.S. neighborhood
Knowin' I can do my best in Westwood
Cut off by a white BM, driven by a yuppie
He sticks up his finger like fuck me

Now I gotta follow him home, with my chrome
Send him to the Twilight Zone, it's on
Niggaz say I'm gone 'cause I'm fuckin' with the rich
Say what but they all full of bitch, yeah

Don't need a snitch so I'm rollin' solo
In a straight bucket, no it ain't a low, low
He pulls up to a seven bedroom, eight bath
Oh yeah, he's got to feel the wrath

Pistol to the neck, devil turn off the Westec
And when you're rollin' have mo' respect, bitch
Tied his ass up and took everything I could
A nigga straight robbin', mobbin', back to the hood

All my niggaz love the adventures of

Robbin' Hood 'cause it ain't all good

Since two-eleven is my favorite number
Fuck squabbin' 'cause I be Robbin' like the Boy Wonder
Holy bandit, leave yo' ass stranded and you know that
Unhook the LoJack, cellular phone under the flo' mat

They wanna say that it's federal
Actin' like your ninety-five Coupe is headed fo'
Beirut they wanna shoot me like a terrorist
But I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm takin' care of this

Trigger finger got blisters
Heard from your sisters, you be rollin' on the twisters
Now when we meet, I can make your heart beat
And make you feel so neat

Or you can get us fifteen
Twenties out the ATM, I'll take all of them, give 'em up
I'm king of the Slim Jim, it's the incredible
Nine-oh-two-one-oh, is where I'm headed foe

Don't need no Merry Men, I fuck around and bury them
If they told, what I stole
Motherfuckers got to know that I'm lethal
Steal from the rich and slide it to my people

All my niggaz love the adventures of
All my niggaz love the adventures of
All my niggaz love the adventures of
Robbin' Hood 'cause it ain't all good

I stalk rich ass people like Hudson Hawk
Bitch don't talk, let's take a walk
Nigga got nuttin' to lose, you know the rules
The purse and the jewels or the eleven o'clock news

Which one? Magnum gun to the titties
Makin' scared devils move from my city
With the strong-arm, fuck the long arm of the law
Bitch count to ten and forget who you saw, hurry up

Had to clock her with the handle
'Cause your husband's a thief with an S and L scandal
Don't feel bad if you're stuck up
Nobody move, nobody get, shut the fuck up

I'm nervous, quick to serve this
Heat in yo' meat, make your blood skeet
A nigga just tryin' to get on his feet
So hurry up, rich bitch, before I twitch

She said, ""Don't rape me and don't kill me""
Nigga don't want to fuck, yo' filthy ass
Just give me the cash and we good
All I wanna do is rob you on my way to the hood

Ice Cube,"Mr. Dirty Harry, you look really scary
With your .357, officer Kevin
Spent 11 years on the force trying to get mine
Head got the flat top, boots got the spit shine
Don't give a fuck about my neighborhood
Just wanna do your eight hours, then hit the showers
Shoot a brother down adn you don't send flowers
Goddamn sherrif, can't wait to tarriff
A chunk of a nigga ass, but watch a nigga blast
And get away nigga fast
You ain't gonna have me face down no more
You ain't gonna have a chance to clown no more
To the boys in blue, I got kids too
Ain't going out like a jigaboo, no no no
On my way to the store
You see me in a Range Rover, now you gotta pull me over
But where oh where is the ticket?
You got your hand on your gun cause you're wicked
You don't like the face of the original man
But you gotta treat me like an individual man
Talk right and I'll talk right back
Show some goddamn respect to the black
Cause I gotta get back to my wife
But I'm sorry, you ain't gonna take my life

Just because you got a badge
Did you think Ice Cube was gonna wave the white flag?
Cracker please, you can yell freeze
I'd rather die standing up than die on my knees
You think you can do anything you want to do
To my crew when you come through, man fuck you
Shooting up South Central
Catch your ass slipping at a rent show
Could have popped you off, one dead cop
But I know you got a wife and a dog named Spot
I show a little mercy cause I'm civilized
Looking through a nigga's eyes at a much bigger prize
But when I saw Rodney it got me so hot
Made me wanna go out and pop me a cop
Cause every time you see me sagging
Here comes the Grand Dragon, in the motherfucking patty wagon
Try to play me like a trick
Sometimes you act like a dick, Mr. Nightstick
Back then, I used to throw my Mack-10
But nowadays you got the black skin
Back then you don't like the voice of a nigga named Ice
But you ain't gonna take my life

You man let's get an understanding
I know that your job is demanding
But I only got me one life to live
You only got about six shots to give
And I got a big AK with a 50-round clip
So why should we trip?
You ain't gonna punk me, so what you trying for?
Ain't no job worth dying for, is it?
Might pay a visit to Petey Wheatstraw
When you stop me on the shore, officer of the law
And if I did something wrong, you can lock me up
Never never never gonna sock me up
So next time you have the urge, all of the sudden
To fuck with a nigga for nothing
Think about me, a brother that's 23
I got a son and a J-O-B
So before you pull your gun, you'd better think twice
Pig, cause you ain't gonna take my life
",U Ain't Gonna Take My Life
Ice Cube,"Microphone check, yo, yeah

They won't call me a nigga
They won't call me a nigga

Listen to the preacher man, but are you talkin' to me?
I can't hear you with a mouth full of pig's feet
Thy shouldn't eat the swine flesh
Your body is a mess but you're blessed

With the Father, Son, Spirit an' the Holy Ghost
But my whole neighborhood is comatose
Lookin' for survival
The Devil made you a slave an' he gave you a Bible

400 years of gettin' our ass kicked
By so called Christians an' Catholics
But I'm a watch 'em burn in the fire
See I'm a G, that's why I ain't in your choir

'Cause I see, 'cause I know
The church ain't nuttin' but a fashion show
Get the Devil do a 187
An' they won't call me a nigga when I get to Heaven

They won't call me a nigga when I get to Heaven
No they won't, no they won't, no they won't

You're waitin' for the Devil to come from the ground
Clown, take a look around
Just look at the cross that the priest is holdin'
A beast in sheep's clothin'

But I'm rollin' with that knowledge of self
'Cause Heaven ain't just wealth
So mister preacher, if I couldn't pay my tithe
Do I have to wait outside?

White man, please take another look
'Cause we couldn't be readin' out the same book
'Cause you'se a crook an' I'm a brother
King James had sex with his mother

Is that yo' edition? Is that your religion?
Black man, you gotta make a decision
'Cause God is comin' on day number seven
An' they won't call me a nigga when I get to Heaven

They won't call me a nigga when I get to Heaven
No they won't, no they won't, no they won't
They won't call me a nigga when I get to Heaven
No they won't, no they won't, no they won't

The same white man that threw me in the slammer
He bombed the church in Alabama
So if I cock the hammer, God won't mind
If I have to kill the human swine

'Cause God is a killer from the start
Why you think, Noah had to build his Ark?
An' God is a man from his feet to his hair
That's why you say 'Amen' after each an' every prayer

I just stare at the church, man
Spendin' mo' money on the church band
But Elijah's got a plan
Got the white man screamin', ?Damn that Farrakhan?

'Cause one day these babies'll uprise
Much more than bow ties an' bean pies
Kickin' knowledge at the 7/11
An' they won't call me a nigga when I get to Heaven

They won't call me a nigga when I get to Heaven
No they won't, no they won't, no they won't
They won't call me a nigga when I get to Heaven

Know what? I'm makin' moves, puttin' cash behind plans
To blow up, will he style like this

Stay in the mix like Alezay

On the prowl again to get hunnies familiar with the smile again

I givin' livin' definition long as my hearts tickin'
I fought and made the world listen
Whatever fly Dr. Dre invented
Turn on the box and let my son watch these studio clowns on 60 inches
I push a rover, shit platinum before the sessions over

These players best to get they shit in check
Cause when I get my hustle on ain't no playin' with a full deck

Lord please, murder my enemies (Yeah)
Burn em at a thousand degrees
And lord please let me make mo cheese
Cause I ain't quite ready to leave (No)

Buck the whole world
Meant that, gotta stay strapped
Cause 99.9 a niggas, carry they gats
Super fist fightin' shit might come down to dyin'
When the time comes down for the tryin' I got nine
Reasons why niggas shouldn't step in my face
With the nonsense, cause I'm always heated and you can taste this
Audi little something out the seams a my trousers
With no hesitation I got a team to come clown ya
I down ya, so let your people know what they face
With the type of individual that'll bomb a sub-station
Kaboom! and everybody dies outside
There ain't no escapin' the Reaper so don't try
Go ahead, close ya eyes, who the next to step?
Face down, hit, bleedin' on the steps a death
Check yo self, you just been invaded by true soldiers
December 31st, 96 (the game is over)

Smokin' weed I never trail, I lead
Spendin' dough, tripped the cost of a ride like it was pocket money, Gs
But these are the things real players do
Talkin' shit is real things that the haters do
I'm namin' you
Shit's thick, its time to run for shelter
I kept the word, things could happen to marks like it was helter skelter
Dear diary, I'm runnin' outta pages
Fadin', in and out, takin' purple hazes
The dazes, Revelations in the last stages
Red sky's institute, the silent horns playin
I'm prayin' with tears in my eyes
Cause I'm tryin' to make it into eternal peace without dyin'
But they eyein' my bank account with beams on my rover
The killa failed to launch his attack (the game is over)

Strictly for the riders who ride us I gotta WestSider
Rhymer for them niggas that's sittin on them Dayton wires
Pump the bass, hit the switch
Cause Ice Cube, Mack 10, and Dub-C, back up in this b-i-itch
Straight hoodsta for life, ain't no lookin back
Ink in my flesh, WestSide tattoed on my chest
Walkin with the shadow of death
Through the land of the skanless, South Central Los Angeles
Home of the Crips and the Bloods
Where even the strongest niggas is drug through the mud
And visitors from outta town best to stay in Hollywood
You get that tourist ass ganked strollin through my hood
West coast till the casket drop
I be throwin it up, so motherfucker West Up!

It's gun ho Mack one, no please you can't fuck wit deez
Ice Cubez and Dub-Ceez is my G'z
And hip-hop, top three niggas the new bosses
Never slippin cause we flosses, packin Nina Rosses
Nigga, thought You Knew How We Do It
Ain't a Damn Thing Changed, always On Them Thangs
Forever and a day, so back up, gimme room, don't neglect
Just respect and everything I can't check I wreck
Now you can cross out the bustas and snitches
Shit only killers hootchie bitches and hot hydraulic switches allowed
On the turf where the real hogs dwell
Sewed up the hood, the fattest boulders on the block for sale

To bail through, it's fin you're in with Mack 10
And I gotta confess up, nigga this West Up! for life

So motherfucker West Up!

Now I got ta show you how the West coast rocks
No razor blades, in my mouth, just a Glock
And I'm hittin you up, with that W-S
The sun rises in the East, but it sets in the West
No gold teeth, you gets a wreath
So hand me the goodies, stockin mask, no hoodies
Christmas day, I'm in a tre
While some of you niggas got the robe reindeer and a sleigh
We don't call it five-oh, we call it one time
It's my life my life my life my life, in the sunshine!
One nine weighs a ton
How the fuck you think that the West was won?
Now shit can be squashed over a forty ounce of backwash
No jokes, the land of locs and hundred spokes
In the East, we can be brothers
But when you come to L.A., watch your motherfuckin colors
West Up! nigga

Front back side to side
We be givin it up, till the day we die
Niggas hit me up, I'mma have ta erupt
So motherfucker West Up!

Front back side to side
We be givin it up, till the day we die
Niggas hit me up, I'mma have ta erupt
So motherfucker West Up!

Give it up, give it up
Like the nigga James Brown, me and my niggas are puttin it down
So bustas be wary cause see we represent the city
Where niggas caught slippin is left with they brains drippin
City of the Angels, more like a concrete jungle
Full of macks Cadillacs and crack sacks
I pledge allegiance to the shit till I die
So let the five-twenty slide and put it down from the WestSide

Front back side to side
We be givin it up, till the day we die
Niggas hit me up, I'mma have ta erupt
So motherfucker West Up!

Front back side to side
We be givin it up, till the day we die

Niggas used to come and get me 
When it was time to disagree with an enemy
Pass the Hennessy it gives me energy
Packed the gat in the small of my back
Where these niggas at I clear the whole pack
Talkin' shit 'cause I'm down for my set I'm a vet 
Smokin' on a wet cigarette 
(who these niggas think they are)
(wishin' on a ghetto star I represent my tar)
I start bustin' and they scatter like water bugs 
'cause these westside niggas is harder thugs 
Enslave us but nothin' can save us from sportin' Ben Davis
Shootin' at your neighbors
(cause sometimes I feel like a nut don't give a fuck when I open ya up)
Hot rocks fly from the back seat and 
Busta ass niggas run like a track meet
An if you crawl in the middle bleed mo' than a little (what)
Killer king is the hospital
Feelin' numb from the bullets I hum 
And when they hit black mothers have fits I don't give a shit

Fool I'm a vet you can bet that 
I could dance underwater and not get wet (check it)
Its rainin' bullets and I'm still there
(Foe life) I'm still there

my house shoes get wet from the dew on the grass
Up early in the morning takin' out the trash
Feelin' like a loser alcohol abuser 
Two youngsters roll up on a beach cruiser
One on the peddles the other on the handle bars (what)
Tryin' be ghetto stars they said:
Are you from the west side is it so? 
I said hell yea and who wanta to know (me)
In slow mo fo' fo' slugs face down in the mud 
Puddle full of blood left for dead 
The pain starts to spread now I can't feel my legs
I meet doctor who at King Drew medical center 
As I enter I.C.U.
He said the bullet hit a nerve that was vital
I said I can't move my legs he said don't try to
Now this ain't the end my friend but you'll probably never walk again
I sit there motionless holdin' this pain inside contemplating suicide
At night I jerk and jerk
But my dick don't work it don't even hurt (damn)
Now who'd ever thought a nigga rude as Ice Cube 
I be pissin' through a tube Fool I'm a vet

Fool I'm a vet you can bet that

fuck a V-A they need G-A 
Gang hospital for a cripple now I'm drinkin' rippal
Same corner same hood I'm still there
With bandannas tied to my wheel chair
To all the hoodrat hoes I'm fired
They mad 'cause my tongue get tired
Now everybody wanna put they dope on me 
Sayin' I won't get searched by the LAPD
I'm sitting on a doorway duece five
Dependin' on that to keep my ass alive
I don't got bows but my arm's about a one-six
My fuckin' legs, lookin' like tooth picks
Some times I can't deal got to beg the be G's to roll me up the hill 
Put me on the porch now I'm on the torch smokin' cocaine
Just to maintain nothin' to gain nothin' to lose 
And last night I couldn't make it to the bathroom
Feelin' like a two year old you can't get a sip from the brew I hold
Nigga its the only friend to a stranger AKA hadicap gangbanger
There's a lot in my life I regret becomin' a ghetto vet
Fool I'm a Vet

I got that bomb, bomb, diddy, diddy, diddy, bomb, bomb
When I hit you
Push the issue
My ghetto dope is amazin'
The bitch that's with you already know that I'm blazin'
That's by the number, we can slumber, on the under
Girl no wonder, you got a ass full of thunder
The frozen Tundra ain't cold enough
And baby ain't old enough
For this game I'm rollin' up
De-zamn it feels good to be the don
Straight legit, while niggas like Gotti just sit

No more fuckin' with that homegrown
Hit the shit we on
The rolleo's and the baggetts
You still fuckin' with them faggets
We turn haters into maggets
Oak on the dash, but no coke on the hash
You broke ass niggas learn to mash, like me
Constantly, put the hustle down
With four or five niggas that's musclebound
Send your head to the taxidermist
Won't be satisfied, till I get my face on a thermos
You got to earn this, you can't take it
Can't fake it, got to live it, or we gots to visit
Who is it, the exquisite, Don Mega
Walkin' with my entourage, I think I'm betta, makin' chedda
You see me sag in my Jag, with the rag recognize the flag
You betta get back, everybody wanna do it like me
I got it made, been makin' rap money since the tenth grade

[Chorus]

I keeps a firm grip on my shit when in transit
Uncandid, it's the young bandit
Fresh out the trenches, the wood works
City of the Tempeon, where the hoods lurk
In search of the rich blocks, to lick spots, and kick rocks
From shattered glass, down the pig locks
Want tips by the clock
You niggas scramblin' for fouyan
And settle for crumbs and croutans
I'm out for armored bucks and armored trucks, with armed killas
Bitch niggas get swallowed by the armadillos
Ain't no harmin' me, the army full honary niggas you can't see
So while you pace bitches and Saturn's livin' jenky
I hangs with niggas who got patterns on they hankey
After Ben Frankeys, with the big skullen eyes
You niggas bound and nullified
Sit back and mine stack it multiply

Yeah, just get the fuckin' door

Limos, demos and bimbos
(Hey, slow this motherfucker down, man)
Limos, demos and bimbos

Hit the sunroof and let's contemplate the freaks we can run through
Got the chauffer pullin' over
Snatch one inside, she wanna ride with this mission
Close the partition, he like to listen
All fuckin', no kissin', just smokin' and drinkin'
Super vets in a super stretch Lincoln
Think 'bout the good ol' days of hip hop
In its purest form before the eye of the storm

I could give a fuck about you hatin' on my way
To the coliseum with seventeen-five waitin'
They scream for the limousine, it's all clean
Tinted, your shit is rented, you know we spend it
While you worry 'bout the five mics, I'm in the limelight
Wit movies comin' out, yo' time is runnin' out
I just finished doin', 'Live At The Apollo'
Indication from my driver, damn, we're bein' followed

You're livin' so trife, you need Jesus in your life
I'm livin so trife, I need Jesus in my life
You're livin' so trife, you need Jesus in your life
I'm livin' so trife, I need Jesus in my life

Caught him in motion, had me potent, let him know about the showin'
And how I'm knowin' to keep it cracked open
Cans of ass-beatin', plus on how I crash meetin's
And have your whole staff leavin half-breathin'
Got shit to hold my own, big bucks
But Khop's soon to run it through 'em, nigga check nuts
Put to the test, then put two to rest
Wiped out with lights out, two to the chest

Hold it now tell a few, legitimate
We loaded for revenue, let's get this shit
And split this shit for three days, count it three ways
Nigga fuck, what he say, havin' heat pays
It's all about the thoroughbred, top choice with the voice
That keep [Incomprehensible] moist
Mr. Short Khop expected the truest, dare you niggas step to us
I stay connected til' death do us

I'm livin' so trife, I need Jesus in my life
You're livin' so trife, you need Jesus in your life

The alley was pitch black, I'm in the back of this black Lac
These fuckers pull up in a ac
They don't understand the impact
Two thousand dollar, three-piece suit, can you spend that?
They call me the Don Mega
'cause I'm down to play a double-header in stormy weather
Superstar, goddamn them niggas got me
Stop the car and blast the paparazzi

You're livin' so trife, you need Jesus in your life

Ice Cube,"One mo' strike and I'm through, nigga
Bottom of the ninth swingin', for my life
I'm up at the plate, goin for the gate
They got my moms seated in section eight
Been on deck since my last felony
I'm that 0 for 2 motherfucker
With the Louisville Slugger
Shay Whitie, that left hand punk
Is on the mound and he comin' wit that off-speed junk
Its the West side Hustlers, vs these LA Pigs
You can say the damned vs the nigs
My little homies in the dugout
They lookin' sad, cause fourteen niggas done struck-out
My first offense was possession of weed
Now I'm in the major leagues and
That motherfucker Bill Clinton-is a son of a bitch
Had the nerve to throw out the first pitch
I'm just tryin' to get rich like Trump
The Home Run king is now in a slump, pass me a hunk
How the fuck can I stay out the pen
When its one-two-three strikes you in

[Chorus]
One-two three strikes you in
Now how the fuck a nigga supposed
To stay out the pen, I'm on a blend
Of Gin and Hen, everyday of my life
With two strikes it ain't right

He's in the wind-up
Here come the pitch
I swing, aw shit (foul tip)
They felt the chill cause if I get on first
You know the deal, a niggas gots to steal
Like to steal home and I betcha
That I can run over, the LA Pig catcher
Just because I'm black, wit a bat
They wanna send a nigga back to the warning track
Full of count they say I won't amount to shit
But fool I can hit like Kenny Grit
With a split in my mouth on tha cellular phone
(It's going, going, gone!)
And watch a pitcher get served
You from the LA Pigs
I know you coming with a curve
Hey batter, batter is the chitter-chatter
I'm the designated hitter, a nigga
Much badder, than Babe Ruth
Will I tell the truth and nothing but the truth
Hell yea, I'd rather be shootin' hoops
Cause a niggas guaranteed to win
Against a bullshit loss and three strikes you in

Take me out to the ballgame
Take me out to the crowd (wha what, wha what)
Another nigga on trial
Keep ya peanuts Jeezuh
And fuck you Cracker Jack
I hope I never come back

I gots to root for my homeboys
If they don't win its a shame
Cause its one-two-three strikes you in
Twenty-five years of pain you know my name

They wanna nigga to run and get hung
High strung, so this pig can win the Cy-Young
I'ma hit this motherfucker a mile
In the batters box, high as Steve Hal
You can't salary cap my gat
No strike, cause gangsta-rap is on the map
I'm like Satchel Paige wit a gauge
Or Jackie Robinson, when I'm robbin' one
Of you Cracker Jacks fool I'm a motherfuckin' vet
And fuck yo seventh-inning stretch, so
Take me out to the ballgame,
And see my neighborhood name
In your Ghetto Hall of Fame

Buy a new pair of drawers and motherfuckers spot it
Niggas plotted, to have me knotted up in basements
till these cocksuckers see what they're faced with
Their fantasies of a life stress-free
Full of orgies, in the Florida Keys
But this bullshit is so thick, it's like mountains
Sick of threatenin all my lawyers and accountants

'cause motherfuckers think it's all grav-ay wit my pay day
And like I said, it's the curse of money

See this ass kissin yes man
Shakin hands with the left hand, get my weap-an, get to stepp-an

So God bless Don Polla, double-s 
I gotta holla 'cause I'm smokin' on double breath 
Freakin', niggas be leakin', information 
Got the feds seekin', incarceration 
Niggas say my name popped up 
Bitch hop up 
Nigga close the shop up 
They try to stop em 
My cash flow leave me asshole neck it 
Gone in sixty seconds, burn all records 
Nigga gettin' skinny eating dinnies 
Count my pennies, only got a bag fulla twenties 

[Chorus] 
Listen, these feds fishin' for this extradition 
I'm on a mission, fuck em, fight em, dine em, ditch em 
I gotta kick rocks, can't pick locks 
Or spend the rest of my life in a shit-?bath 

It's so hard to get a room without a credit card 
It's so hard not to let em know where you are 
Tried to get a rent a car 
But he laughed when I showed him cash 
Had to mash 'fore he called the feds on my ass 
Went to Vegas for the weekend 
Met a hoe down freakin' 
Hey bitch, why you sneakin'? 
Grabbed the paper out her hand 
Am I the man on the front page? (Fuck) 
Same height, same age (click-click) 
Rap gauge, put it down the G-way 
Got my hostage suckin' sausage on the freeway 
She say ""Let's hear the circle K"" 
Ran inside and made the niggas all pay 
It's like I hit the Lotto outside Colorado 
Brought it there for his wallet and my bottle 
That's my motto and I gotta warn ya 
Before I'm through, I'm going back to California 

Keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run 
I swear I didn't do what they say I done 
I swear I didn't do what they say I done

[Chorus] 

[Verse 3] 
My boys you're taught at Illonois 
Set the poise, so I can infiltrate 
All fifty states 
Can't wait till I'm back on my feet 
Switch and shake this bitch in her sleep 
Low key you feds can't see me 
I'm up in D.C. with strike number three 
Clownin', made a little stock to get a little cock 
Now I got niggas bangin' and lootin' rock 
I'm going back to Cali where it's bound with my strikes 
Don't give a fuck who's on the ?marin or the mic 
I should've known when I seen that motherfucker in the lobby 
Looking like he want to rob me (Fuck) 
Federal, don't like no black hetero, sexual, intellectual 
Tried to turn me into a vegetable 
An I'm 'a sue all black and blue 
When I come to- hand cuff (Fuck y'all) 
Big grey bus, scandalous 
'cause they can't stand us 
They get excited and I try to fight it (mama) 
I'm going back to Cali to show, extradited 

Keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run 
I swear I didn't do what they say I done 
I swear I didn't do what they say I done

[Chorus] 

Hey mama, when y'all send pictures you can't send a Polaroid 
Got to be the regular pictures 
An' they got us in here puttin' in computer chips or something 
I don't know. 
Like they playin with us, it's like a game 
It ain't nothin' but a game to them mama

Fuck you, fuck you and fuck you
The world ain't yours, the world ain't yours
(repeat)
[Verse 2]
On an' off, off an' on, bitch I'm grown
So stop playing on my phone (stop)
It was a time we used to bump and grind
And find heaven (ahh)
Without a motherfucking reverend
Managoua twages and bomb-ass massages
And dreams of three-car garages
You say I'm cheating when I'm up at the studio
Come to find out you the hoe, oh
And you was way out
Talkin' 'bout rap, was gonna play ya
And I was wasting my time writing rhyme (hahaha)
You made yourself loud and clear
You wanted me to choose between you and my career (bitch)
Started fucking with this baller named Chris
Couldn't resist the Rolex on his wrist
I kept on writing my raps with profanity
Now I'm on tour fucking bitches like Fanady
You tried to diss this, now you missed this
And the first and fifteenth is like Christmas
Send me naked pictures but give it a rest
With Mrs Ice Cube tatood on your breast
Now you at the back door of my show
Dressed like a hoe, axin' could you blow (no),
Hell no but it's still delicious
Went from rags to riches
And fuck all my X-bitches
[Chorus 2]
Fuck you, fuck you, especially you
The world ain't yours, the world ain't yours
(repeat)
Now I hear you sayin' ""Yeah I used to fuck 'em""
Not lettin' 'em know I was a young buck then
Niggaz axin' me ""Man, did you love her?""
Loved her stupid ass enough to fuck her with a rubber (bitch)
Now I hear, I'm your big brother (who?)
Second cousin, friend
Bitch since when?
Incest ain't the way I swing (nah)
Never bought your ass a goddamn thing
That I had to pay for
I was hateful
Ungrateful (uh) and never faithful
Fuckin' everything that I could get my paws on
Walkin' through hell with gasoline draws on
Now I'm on the mic, music is my life
Kids and a wife, heard you was a dite (damn)
It's your thing if you like the switches
But it's my world and fuck all my X-bitches
(Chorus 1)
(Chorus 2)

The Don Daata, gotta get you hotter
Been a buck naked nigga smokin' water
On a friday, the get high day
Blowin' at a hot date, findin' Shade
Black and bicantay, with ass everwhere, how you do that there?
A sight to behold, break the mold
Just tryin' to get some before the world explode
I see you tryin' to get caught
Well shake what your mama gave ya, plus what you bought
We fuck and we fought, we laugh and we cry
Told the truth and we lie

You be good to me, i'll be good to you
Anything you want, anything you do
I got my eyes on you, and i'm in to you
Give it all I got, and to keep it hot

Now what a freak like you, doin' with a fool like me?
Explain it to your family
It's got to be insanity --because I like what you're doing to me
You know you ain't right standin' at the light
Think it's chocolate with that shit too tight
And if I fuck around and get you in the car with me
Motherfuckers would think I had a star with me
Now see the haterism increase
They hate when you got a dime piece
And I got one shotgun, and I might catch a hot one
When i'm lookin' for love and niggas got none, uhh
If you let me handcuff your wrist
Bonnie and Clyde ain't got shit on this
Cuz Bonnie and Clyde had to take a risk
But most of my money see it's all legit baby
It's all about your state of mind
Now what would you do if I handed you a tech nine?
Are you feelin' me?
Would you stay down like Hillary?
Even if you thought about killin' me?

You be good to me, i'll be good to you
Anything you want, anything you do
I got my eyes on you, and i'm in to you
Give it all I got, and to keep it hot

Now what a freak like you, doin' with a fool like me?
Explain it to your family
It's got to be insanity --because I like what you're doing to me
Are you the type of girl that would call them folks
Have your man leave the house in chains and ropes
Don't need the kind of girl that'll have me in court
On lawsuits lyin' about demestic abuse
Have a bitch like Judge Judy cussin' me out
Garnish my cheques, reposses my lex
Cuz I come from a place in southern Californi
Where hoes rake niggas for tons of alimoni
But fuck the world don't aks me for shit
Unless you my boo, and i'm fuckin' you
The rest of these broads ain't knowin'
That i'm a have you bumpin' Lauryn, in somethin' foreign
Come thru blow the horn
Stick your wrists out the window
And wave to your kinfolks
Let 'em know who you with
And to your crazy ass daddy, let him know who to get

You be good to me, i'll be good to you
Anything you want, anything you do
I got my eyes on you, and i'm in to you
Give it all I got, and to keep it hot

Now what a freak like you, doin' with a fool like me?
Explain it to your family
It's got to be insanity --because I like what you're doing to me
Now what a freak like you, doin' with a fool like me?
Explain it to your family
It's got to be insanity --because I like what you're doing to me
Now what a freak like you, doin' with a fool like me?
Explain it to your family
It's got to be insanity --because I like what you're doing to me

Ice Cube,"Say you little son of a bitch what choo tryin' to be

When I'm big I want to be a thug 
You want to be a thug huh (Yeah yeah)
What choo know (About) a thug huh (Yeah yeah)
You want to see the bad guy
Look at Ice Cube (Yeah yeah) that's the bad guy
You need people like him can point cha fingas
Huh? (Yeah yeah) the fuck you know about this shit
You ready to die, OK a-why
Where is that, you ready
'Cause they ain't touch the bad guy, OK

I'm the nigga of the century 
Oh, so choo a bad guy, c'mon prove it 
C'mon, you think you bad
How bad you are 

I'm the nigga of the century 
C'mon lets see how bad you are 
C'mon bad guy, see'moawnl

We the worsest, all purpose 
You want murderers 
Well you serve us, hattin' motherfuckers with curb dust 
You heard us, don't shit make us nervous 
Not even when these fuckin' feds try to serve us 
Mention me, when you write it in your history 
As a nigger with the key to the mystery 
Grand motta ain word don't mean shit to me 
Who gives a fuck what they think, and what they see 
Live how I got to live 
Give what I got to give 
Teach my kids positive, as well as the negative 
Hope to raise better kids 
The world needs a sedative, pray to god that we let him live 

[Chorus:]
'Cause you bad guy, I'm the nigga of the century
The diamond scruff, all you niggas better mention me
Me that's who, it ain't no mystery
Goin' down in history, niggas better mention me

You better mention me, I'm the nigga of the century 
Ok a-why, all you niggas better mention me 
Me that's who, it ain't no mystery 
Goin' down in history, niggas better mention me 

A nigga told me to keep hope alive 
Survive, and 95 I'll get you paradise 
So I tried, nigga had to swallow his pride 
But look into my eyes, I'm too wise to cook fries 
Twelfth grade graduation, summer vacation 
Mama said get the facin' on them applications 
Didn't know back then, I was too young 
Public school made me dumb as a motherfucker 
What should I do in my life 
Reverend price, do you got some advice 
Before I roll the dice 
A nigga don't want to shoot craps, 'cause it ain't all fun and games 
When you tryin' to get that money mang 
Gangbang, maintain or slang cane 
T.V. got a nigga where he can't use his brain 
What the fuck you talkin' bout, choose or loose 
Bitch I don't know the motherfuckin' rules (For real) 

[Chorus]

Who am I when it's do or die 
You can see a man's soul through the human eye 
Can't spend all your lifetime gettin' high 
'Cause you and I got to do, for you and I 
Actin' wild as a juvenile 
Now my whole life depends on the outcome of a trial 
Wait-pow; these people ain't playin' now 
Got to bring 85 percent of the time now 
Fuck that, rather roll with the ruff pack 
In the jet black, listenin' to ruff rap 
See it's quite simple, you bitches ass niggas don't know 
What I've been through, the weather's presidential 
The warfare's mental, I sell my soul to the lord 
For the perfect instrumental 
And the number two pencil 
And all the hustle found in chromosomes of my kinfolk 

[Chorus] 

Yeah, OK, OK, ok, OK, call loko take it easy mang, choo got it
Choo leave it the fuckin' illest nigga to fuckin' shit you
Dess no problem withs that, gawn'na fuck dat
June have a fuckin' heart attack 
It's over, everybody knows now
It's no fuckin' secret
Choo know dis motherfucker, OK a-why
It's over, that's it, die
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

I got that bomb, bomb, tit-tit...

A nigga told me  the record company's the pimp 
The artist is the hoe  The stage is the corner 
And the audience is the trip, god damn 

(verse one) {:21} 
Incredible young nigga  
You can't believe I'm just one nigga 
God damn I've gotten bigger 
Intellect superior  
Walk in a room and make the whole interior inferior 

If you look me in my eyes 
You might fuck around and loose control of your mind body and your soul 
Grab a hold 
Undisputed on the microphone, what you think 
If you wink, I'll make you extinct
Did you blink, did you ever drink your own brain matter 
Shotgun enema, this ain't no cinema 
All praises due to the creator 

For this man here, that can't no nigga stand near 
True, inventor of the 'W'
What You want to do, I got the red and the blue 
Show me one nigga dedicated to raps 
I'll show you ten niggas dedicated to snaps 

Record company death traps settin' decoys 
Just to pimp young b-boys 
With a cup full of yak, studio contact 
Maniac with a contract 

Well turn up the bass and the motherfuckin' treble 
About to do a deal with the devil for my vocal level 
Bullshit points, plus he want to rub it in 
And take all my publishin', god damn 

Do i take it up the rectum 
Just to rock the spectrum 
Give up a right arm, just to do a form 
Hell no, all you motherfuckers goin' leave this bitch limpin'

I'ma keep it simple, it went from ""please listen to my demo"" 
To ""get your ass out my limo"" 
Stretch presidential 
It's essential 'cause the record company will have your ass in a rental 

If you let 'em, You have to behead 'em 
Contracts you never read 'em 
CEO's you never met 'em 
Sent to an attorney, Burnstein and Burney 
Nigga that's his lawyer, ain't got nothin' for ya 

Treat ya like they employer, I'm a warrior 
Bite you in the ass like a Georgetown Hoyas 
When they ignore ya cause, you got to hold your balls 
Catch a motherfucker slippin' in bathroom stalls 

And then you show 'em that you ain't a rookie 
Let 'em know that you'd rather have, more points than more pussy 
Pimp turned bookie 
Now how the fuck I get in so much debt 
God damn, we just met 

He said, welcome to the rap game 
Motherfucker be confused and broke before he know what's happenin' 
You can be the star and fuck women 
I'm a just play the back and keep pimpin'

Hey young thugs
Get your mind right, and get your grind right

Look into my eyes if you want to know me
Before you hypnotized, homey what do you see
A figure that's just a little bigger than dealers
A hustler countin' figures ain't pulled no triggers
Can you dig us, we be the ultimate lick
We's the hitters, that make the ultimate hits
Kinda flossy, kinda bossy
It's gotta be done my way, do what the {fuck} I say
Top of the pyramid, homey what I tell you
If you leave this Westside umbrella you hit the cellar
Bring me my slippers, black robe, and my globe
And I could rule the world with my eyes closed

Too many orders to give, what it is, showbiz
Taught you what a trick and a hoe is (what?)
Showed you what a Six-ty Fo' is (what?)

And everybody in the world want to be like us (everybody)

Forget about the fast buck; boy, get you ass up
People use yo' brain to gain
Do something that ain't never been done; and we can spend hun's
Wipe our ass with twenties, light our joints with ones
Throw away the guns, have nuttin but fun
And homey we could do that {shit}!
Police have a fit, when yo' paper's legit
We gotta get off the phone, we gotta teach our own
Send your baby to school and she'll come back grown
We got to talk to our grandma's
And she'll help us through them dark halls, and them pitfalls
Everybody know we got the world to gain

Tic-tic-boom
Hear me banging down these back streets
Bumpin' Blackstreet, treated like a athlete
Life ain't a track meet (no) it's a marathon
Fuck the cemetery that a nigga get buried on
We be clubbing till the day we die
Nigga ask the bartender if you think we lie
But if you think we high, nigga think again
Cause when it's sink or swim
You got to think to win
And if I drink this Hen'
Everybody will know it
Cause I ain't going for it
So pray to the Lord that I don't pull out
Cuss out and bust out
Go the nigga route
Make the trigger shout, uh
You can try to smoke an ounce to this
While I pronounce this shit
Baby bounce them tits
Mama move them hips
Baby shake them cheeks

Now all I want to do is have fun with my loved ones
The thug ones, relatives and my cousins
And I got 'em by the dozen
When they buzzin', quick to say fuck your husband
This is for my niggas locked away
Extra love for the ones who ain't got no date
But when we hit checkmate with Ice Cube the great
As soon as I get a word we can rush the safe
Fuck them license plates because life is great
It don't matter if you're rich and your folks ain't straight
I'm still coming with that underground gangsta shit
No matter how many niggas say we ain't the shit, bitch

Don't stop get it, get it
(That's real)
Don't stop nigga hit it
(I will)
I'm gon' do it, gon' do it
Gon' do it, do it, do it

Put your back into it
Put your ass into it

I do hard core rhyming, hard time grinding
With will I pimp hoes
Other niggas wine and dine them
Gotta love this pup shit
Passing the mud shit
Pockets on flood shit
OG lyrical blood shit
I don't rent I buy shit
Niggas jealous of my shit
You unaware of this young nigga getting all the fly shit
While you're rooting and recruiting
Nigga 6-8 whooping
I was in the hood shooting cause I had the wife whooping
I come from padres gold in over sized jars
I past up strife and got star awards
No time for playa hating, Mack paper chasing
Came out the substation to the hip hop nation
The mo' hits the mo' bigga with illegal weight figga
Done develop the status of a platinum plus nigga
Bust the first asshole to show I can hit it
I keep pushing, don't quit it
Don't stop till I get it

Don't stop get it, get it
(That's real)
Don't stop nigga hit it
(I will)
I'm gon' do it, gon' do it
Gon' do it, do it, do it

Ice Cube,"So, wide you can't get around it
So, low you can't get under it
So, high you can't get over it
I, can't get over it

Ready or not, here we come
Getting down for the one which we believe in

1993, much more bounce
Ice cube comin' with the half ounce
Not just knee deep, jeep fulla smog
Atomic dog
Like ya behind, heard it through the grapevine
How much longer will you be mine?
And I'ma tell ya, I don't like drama
So do I have to put my handcuffs on your mama
'Cause Bertha Butt did her damn boogie with her crew

But I'd rather boo you
And make you say humdrum, tweedee dum
Humdrum don't succumb when I'm done, buckin' hits
One nation under a groove gettin' down for the funk of it
Tear the roof of this mother like we did last night, son
And hit you with the bop gun

Here's my chance to dance my way
Out of my constriction
Gonna be freakin' up and down
Hang up really late
With the groove I only got
We shall all be moved

Ready or not, here we come
Gettin' down for the one which we believe in
One nation under a groove
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin' can stop us now

If you hear any noise, it's just me and the boys
Playin' with our toys
M-1, 'cuz everybody's gotta have fun
Under the sun, under the sun
So rough, so tough when I get down
The disco fiend with the monster sound
I wants to get funked up when I'm chillin', whoa
The bigger the headache, the bigger the pill in

You let her funk me 'cause my funk is the best
Comin' from the west

Kickin' that hits be occupied
Dedicated to the preservation motion of hips
Hittin' them dips, CD skips but I'm straight
As I bounce, rock, skate, now I'll toast to that
If it's rough, make the girls say, ""Do that stuff! aw, do that stuff!""
But ya got to be, you got to be a freak of the week
For the top gun, hit you with the bop gun

One nation under a groove
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin' can stop us now
One nation under a groove
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin' can stop us now

Do not attempt to adjust your radio
There ain't nothin' wrong, so hit the bong
Waitin' on the double dutch bus for a ride
As the buffalo go round the outside
Put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip
Got daytons on the mothership
And you can ring my bell if you need me to pass
The dutchie on the left hand side for the sale

'Cuz nobody knows where the nose goes when the doors close
Dog chow got the hoes
Lookin' for the theme from the black hole
May I'll big bang you with my black pole
So, flashlight, red light, we don't like cops on the bike
Just made bail, tonight
So whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna have some fun with the bop gun

Ready or not, here we come
Getting down on the one which we believe in

One nation under a groove
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin' can stop us now
One nation under a groove
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move

It's the unseen pullin' strings wit my pinky ring

Bow down, when I'm west-ward bound
Bow down, 'cause I ain't no hater like you
Bow down to a nigga that's greater than you

Now who's dissin' the mad ass Inglewood addition
I bust like a pimple my mind is illmental
The Westside connects with me and south central

And a drag from tha zig zag can't fuck with the Philly's
Holdin' down tha wild west like a kid they call Billy
Once again it's Mack 10 the gold crown holda

Now who wanna fuss so I can buss when I cuss

Since a teen I chased tha green the crack scene king

Killin' niggas for fun, these rappers is done
The bigger they come, the harder they fall
I burn like the sun, continue to ball
He's got nuts and plus the Don touch
And split the fine dutch, Starsky call Hutch
He's laid, with some sluts, up in some guts
Just back, in the cut, he thinks he's King Tut
Can't fuck, this nigga up, cause just, the nigga luck

Hittin' the switch, makin' the fo' hopscotch
Rollin up imperial in Dickie material
All in your peripheral, throwin' shells at your vehicle
Clipped up, pimped up, big chipped up
Stacy Adams tips spiffed up, golf hat flipped up
I blow yo' ass off the map, fuck with Dub
I'll have yo' ass rollin' home with windshield glass on your lap

Ice Cube,"Fuck a ghostwriter, sittin' in the back
Of the studio tryin' to write a nigga rap
It's the Muppet show, most niggas need A&R
To tell 'em how to fuck a hoe
Ice Cube, true emcee
Write everything I say, even back in the day
I'm a spit it how I feel it, fuck a gimmick
You can keep your catchy lines, I'm bout to write a rhyme
If you got a backpack tryin' to act black
Think you know the culture? You's a fuckin' vulture
You never approached a mic
You're dressed like a dike sayin' what ya don't like
Who deserve five Mics, who deserve two
But the nigga with two still can serve you
This West Coast flow is different than the East
But it ain't no different in the street

I'm spittin' pollaseeds (I'm spittin' pollaseeds)
I crack 'em one by one 'cause I don't wanna be greedy
Cause the salt might make you choke
(I'm spittin' pollaseeds) I'm spittin' pollaseeds
I crack 'em one by one 'cause I don't wanna be greedy
Because these niggas is salty they'll make you choke
Oh oh, you niggas got me fucked up


I'm spittin' pollaseeds on the porch with the torch
In case these niggas come around to see the Porsche
When I brandish, motherfuckers vanish
They don't understand like a nigga speakin' Spanish
No comprende, me no speak no Engle
Here now yo' ass feelin' tingley
Now you're doin' shit like Darryl Stingley
Don't get stung by the motherfuckin' stingray
Jumpin' over niggas, y'all better king me
Put your rap careers up on eBay
Crazy Toones is the motherfuckin' D-J
Baby drop to your knees, he deserves a B-J
I got a big brother nicknamed C-J
When you see him in the hood take it easy
If you a breezy, take him to the heezy
Do him like Halle Berry did Michael Ealy

Quick to twist ya, hit ya, it's the chipper
Pistol gripper, skip-skipper runnin' up in your rear view mirror
Ready to bust with my bandanna, bumpin' oldies
Cube throw me the lob like Odom to Kobe
So I could bust a Crip Walk on these niggas
Yellow tape off these niggas, fuck all these salty niggas
They can't hold our shit
Gangsta rap ain't dead, motherfuckers just stole our shit
All you niggas owe us alimony
All you did was switch your name and ate our style up like ravioli
On your club raps I'm pissin', talk shit I'll knock your Comodi glasses
Off your face under the transmission, nigga
From the West side fuckin' up the program
With the surplus hanky hangin' out the Brougham
Dub Sizzla, dippin' on them 'draulics and D's
Spittin' shells at you niggas like pollaseeds

I'm from the land of the gang bang
Since I was little, ain't a god damn thang changed
It's the same ol same
Bush run shit like Sadaam Hussien
I cock and aim, clinically insane
To deal with this bullshit day to day
If I sell some yay or smoke some hay
You bitches wanna throw me up in Pelican's Bay
Call me an animal up in the system
But who's the animal that built this prison
Who's the animal that invented lower living
The projects, thank god for Russell Simmons
Thank god for Sugarhill

Cause when niggas get tribal
It's all about survival, nobody liable

Grandmama came to court with her bible
But when the judge hit the gavel
Now I'm too far from my family to travel
I just came unraveled
Socked the D.A. before I got gaffled
Owned by C.A, State Property
Just like the year fifteen fifty three
Looking for me, a one-way ticket out
Don't understand, what's so hard to figure out?

Pulled the fo-fo up out the dresser
Grabbed the weight up out the closet
Po-po coming but I'm scared to toss it
Y'all know what happened last time I lost it
Can't tell you niggas what the fuckin boss did
D game got a nigga exhausted
Gotta go for the plea bargain they offered
Twenty years for what?
Breaking these laws that's so corrupt
Taking these halls and fillin 'em up
Some powder cake shit that's about to erupt
Ay y'all, I'm about to be stuck
Until the year two thousand, what the fuck?
In the hood, don't press your luck
Cause these motherfuckers will set you up, word up

""Hey, come to Los Angeles!
You and your family can have peace and tranquility.
Enjoy the refinement..""
""Hey Bone, hey nigga where you at though?""
""Hello, my name is Elaine --
and I'll be your tour guide through South Central Los Angeles""
[Ice Cube]
How to survive in South Central (what you do?)
A place where bustin a cap is fundamental
No, you can't find the shit in a handbook
Take a close look, at a rap crook
Rule number one: get yourself a gun
A nine in your ass'll be fine
Keep it in your glove comparment
cause jackers (yo) they love to start shit
Now if you're white you can trust the police
but if you're black they ain't nothin but beasts
Watch out for the kill
Don't make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
and don't get smart
Answer all questions, and that's your first lesson
on stayin alive
In South Central, yeah, that's how you survive
""Hi this is Elaine again.
Are you enjoying your stay in South Central Los Angeles,
or is somebody taking your things? Have you witneesed a driveby?
Okay, make sure you have your camcorder ready
to witness the extracurricular activities on blacks by the police,
so you and your family can enjoy this tape, over and over again.""
""This is Los Angeles."" ""This is Los Angeles.""
[Ice Cube]
Rule number two: don't trust nobody
especially a bitch, with a hooker's body
cause it ain't nuttin but a trap
And females'll get jacked and kidnapped
You'll wind up dead
Just to be safe don't wear no blue or red
cause most niggaz get got
in either L.A., Compton or Watts
Pissed-off black human beings
So I think you better skip the sight-seeing
And if you're nuttin but a mark
make sure that you're in before dark
But if you need some affection mate
Make sure the bitch ain't a section eight
cause if so that's a monkey-wrench hoe
and you won't survive in South Central
""Now you realize it's not all that it's cracked up to be.
You realize that it's fucked up!
It ain't nothin like the shit you saw on TV.
Palm trees and blonde bitches?
I'd advise to you to pack your shit and get the fuck on;
punk motherfucker!""
And you need your ass straight smoked
Yo I want to say whassup to DJ Chilly Chill
Sir Jinx, aiyyo Cube these motherfuckers don't know what time it is
So show these motherfuckers what's happenin
Tell these motherfuckers, don't fuck around in South Central
God damnit!
[Ice Cube]
Rule number three: don't get caught up
Cause niggaz are doing anything that's thought up
And they got a vice
on everything from dope, to stolen merchandise
We discern
cause South Central L.A., is one big yearn
Waitin for a brother like you to catch a disease
and start slangin ki's
to an undercover or the wrong brother
And they'll smother, a out of town motherfucker
So don't take your life for granted
cause it's the craziest place on the planet
In L.A. heroes don't fly through the sky of stars
they live behind bars
So everybody's doin a little dirt
And it's the youngsters puttin in the most work
So be alert and stay calm
as you enter, the concrete Vietnam
You say, the strong survive
Shit, the strong even die, in South Central
Yeah you bitches, you think I forgot about your ass,
you tramp-ass hoes? You better watch out.
And for you so called baller-ass niggaz,
you know what time it is. South Central ain't no joke.
Got to keep your gat at all times motherfuckers.
Better keep one in the chamber and nine in the clip god damnit.
You'll sho' get got, just like that.
This ain't no joke motherfuckers.
Now I want to send a shout-out to E-Dog, the engineer,
puttin his two cents in..

Here's my gun, about to get paid at last

The madder I get, the higher the debt, the deeper you get
The thicker the sweat

I slice verbs and predicets, ghetto etiquette

Y`all better get, this dime-mega s***
The Braniac, the theory be conspiracy
Keep my eye on the birdie, but never get my hands dirty
Verbally call the Maniac and his attack dogs
Signing contracts with automatic jack clause

Who the man be, and what the number one clique is

Let my nuts hang on these busts
And hoes see how big my dick is
Maniac Mack 10 always keep the heat toted
And teflon tips keep the .44 loaded

So it`s your life, not mine n****, so you make the call
Now, I can blow your brains out, punk and act the f***in` fool
Or you can hand your guns over, and let everything be cool
But know this: I won`t hesitate to peel your wig back

I`m off that wet-bomb and the whole fifty yak

Got all the haters, claimin` that they want to talk

You argue wit `em and negotiate, and I really want to kill `em
I`m tired of the bulls***, man I really want to peel `em

So f*** the money and the dope that they punk-a** owe us
Now when I see `em, it ain`t no question it`s all the way on
But I`m a wait in front of they momma house
For that one n**** to get home

And when I gun, watch his body jump
And it`s all going to amaze me
To see his own self
Layin` there with his own brains on the pavement

Free the Jena Six (Nigga free the Jena six!)

They want us to quit, forget

Make me wanna go do a lick right now

Who is the fliest one of all?

[Verse 2]
Now pull in the parking lot
Nigga, find a parking spot
Fired up, everyone want to spark a lot
Puff-puff-pass, we out on Ave.
Lookin' for a big fat ass to harass!
Is it you? Uh-huh, I see you lookin'
When we roll by, pussy still cookin'
Freaks get taken when they lookin' for stars
If you don't like my face, bitch, look at my car!
Keep it simple, I told you once befo'
It really don't matter how I get you to the mo'
It really don't matter how I get you in my low
Just hop in, let's go
And let your friends know!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Do ya thang, girl!
Fuck what they lookin' at!
We the dogs gettin' chased by the pussycat
West Coast, baby, with so much gravy
You should call The Navy, ever since the 80's
I've been doin' good, they been doin' bad
When I see you walk by, I'm pursuin' that
But never chase it, my game is so basic
As soon as I lace it - baby, wanna taste it?
Just face it, put me to the test
Ice Cube would ace it, I'm built for success
Fuck a Rock-star! We wanna party like a Rap Star
In the club, in the house, or the backyard (Yay-yay!)
You make it rain with ones, I make it rain with hun's
And we get lap-dance from nuns
They put away they crucifix
And they say, ""Ice Cube, boy, you the shit!""

[Chorus]

Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Who is the flyest one of all?

[Bridge]
I see you lookin' at me
We don't give a fuck!
What you lookin' at?
We gonna give it up!

Do ya thang, man
Fuck what they lookin' at!
Do ya thang, man
Fuck what they lookin' at!
Do ya thang, man
Fuck what they lookin' at!

You niggas know my pyroclastic flow

You niggas know my pyroclastic flow it's R-A-W, R-A-W

You looking at the grand wizard, war lord vocal chord so vicious
And I don't have to show riches to pull up pull off with some bad bitches
And it ain't about chivalry
It's about dope lyrics and delivery
It's about my persona ain't nothing like a man that can do what he wanna
Ain't nothing like man on that you knew on the corner
See 'em come up and fuck up the owner
See 'em throw up Westside California
Nigga I'm hot as Phoenix Arizona
I'm Utah I got multiple bitches
It's a new law keep a hold of yo riches
Dumb nigga don't spend it as soon as you get it
And recognize I'm a captain and you a lieutenant

I can say what I want to say ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nigga ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
I can act like an animal ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I eat you like a cannibal ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it

I'm raw as a dirty needle
Choke an eagle
Just to feed all my people
Lyrically I'm so lethal
Plant thoughts in they mind just to defeat you
Ice Cube is a saga y'all spit saliva
And I spit lava
I got the fearless flow
Don't get near this ho
If you sacred to go
I keep it gangsta and why should change that
Fuck you old motherfuckers tryin to change rap
But aren't you the same cat that sat back when they brought cocaine back
I'm tryin to get me a Maybach
How you motherfuckers gonna tell me don't say that
You the ones that we learned it from
I heard nigga back in 1971

So if I act like a pimp ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nappy headed ho ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I shoot up your college ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I rob you of knowledge ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it

Thank God when I bless the mic
You finally get to hear the shit that you like
A nigga talkin bout real life so you can try to get this shit right
Use your brain not your back use your brain not a gat
It's a party not a jack (for real)
Don't be scared of them people
Walk up in there and show them that you equal (fuck them fuck them)
Don't be material a nigga grew up on milk and cereal
I never forgot Van Ness and imperial
Look at my life Ice Cube is a miracle
It could be you if you was this lyrical
It could be her if she was this spiritual
'Cause me and Allah go back like cronies
I don't got to be fake cause he is my homie

If I sell a litle crack ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I die in Iraq, ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I take you for granted ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I fuck up the planet ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it

You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow it's R-A-W, R-A-W

Oh yeah and another thing
For all ya niggas that don't do gangsta rap
Don't get on TV talkin about gangsta rap
Cause 9 times at a 10 you don't know the fuck you talk about
Talk about that bullshit rap you do
Stay the fuck out of mines",Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It
Ice Cube,"Yeah

Gangsta

Tell me all my children fore I come through is the hood in the buildin'(yes)
You won't believe what I'm dealing this west coast shit, oh what a feelin' (ahhhh)
Niggaz think I'm drug dealin' 'cause I rolled out with no muthafuckin' sealing (none)
Is he worth a hundred million no need to ask Ice Cube how I'm livin' (I'm living loc)
I still got the recipe, South Central L.A. is the pedigree
Don't try to tell me what it better be, I have your ass up in physical therapy
I outlaw like a Cherokee, the industry tried to bury me
But if I die on a mike of a leraby I'm so heavy you bitches couldn't carry me

[Chorus:]
Get money spend money no money, lookin' like a dummy (I really don't give a fuck)
Your money ain't my fucking money got a pocket full of money (c'mon homie throw it up)
Get money spend money no money, lookin' like a dummy (I really don't give a fuck)
Your money ain't my fucking money got a pocket full of money (c'mon homie throw it up)

I don't accept no disrespect only thing I expect is self check
Just grin and bare it, got an ass whooping that your ass don't wanna inherit
Most rappers are parrots, they say what they told to say to get a neck fool of carrots
Got your momma embarrassed, how long before they callin' us terrorists nigga-I'm serious (I)
Keep it gangsta but I keeps a job cause it's, hard to sleep when you steal and rob (and ya)
Got to run cause here comes the blob cause, Uncle Sam is like part of the Mobb
Break your self he'll take your wealth don't get it twisted u a muthafuckin' elf
And Santa Claus will go for self all you got is your balls and your health

[Chorus:]

Niggaz brag about what they got, but we don't own a skyscraper, now that's paypa
One generation from slums, happy for these little crumb...you little bums
We saw you pull up but nigga shut up (Shut up), you always talk about a fuckin' car or truck
You always talkin' 'bout some fuckin' rims on terrior, that kinda shit will keep an ass inferior
I'm tryina eat tomorro, not tryina hear bout the little bitty shit u ball
Saw your little bitty house on cribs, where you fuck your wife and feed your kids (uhuhh)
Nigga be quiet ain't shit private, everything for sail you can buy it
All this self snitchin', all this self tellin' muthafuckas going back to the watermelon

[Chorus: Repeat 3X]","Get Money, Spend Money, No Money"
Ice Cube,"If you try to get wit me
Pull a four on the fifty
Fuck yo monkey ass up like Bobby did Whitney
Trigger fingers get itchy
When niggaz get bitchy
And they need they story told on Jerry or Ricki
Well you're green and you're iffy
I'm clean and I'm spiffy
If they lock me up today I'll be back in a jiffy
All my niggaz that's wit me
All my bitches are picky
To ride around that's right on time
Bitch you know it's tricky
Take a hit of the sticky
Everybody get tipsy
When we hittin' that whiskey
All my niggaz get pissy
Don't fuck wit no sissy
All we bumpin' is missy
If you know where I am motherfucker come get me
I'm a man out of mickey
All my niggaz love hickies
That don't go away til ya well in your sixties
All I'm wearin' is dickies
Don't try to evict me
When we come to Atlanta we gon' re-open Nickies

I'm a gangsta rap teacher, nigga you better know it
It's the Don Gotti Jr. slash motherfuckin' poet
Sit back and take notes while I spin like hundred spokes
My flow is razor sharp I'm comin' straight for ya throat
With that west coast gang bang
Watch him when his chain hang
East coast down south
Niggaz do the same thang
Throw up ya dubs like Wu-Tang who bang
Harder than that nigga barrelin' thru ya hood wit two chains
Swangin' like he's nuts, 'cuz he don't give a fuck
I know nigga that ain't bangin' in no khaki's or some chucks
It's that westside, connected with that nigga who flow so wreckless
He spent a hundred thousand on his necklace, I bet this
Motherfuckin' coast ain't got shit after me
Ain't have shit before Cube except a Dub C
The mack circle is back with mad purple in fact
I'm 'bout to join the Lynch mob that's me squirtin' the mack",Get Use to It
Ice Cube,"[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
I am the one, that you heard about, read about
I am the one, that had to take the ghetto route
I am the one, don't make me pull this ghetto out
I'm comin' straight from the cave who let him out
Crazy nigga thought he was gone, but he ain't gone
Even King Kong took his black monkey ass home
When I hit the block, watch them scatter like roaches
So don't be fake, 'cause I know what a hoe is
Handle my business, no playin' 'cause I'm focused
You the definition of what a fuckin' joke is
When they see you comin', they play with your emotions
Fuck with my emotions and they find you in the oceans
Yeah I said oceans, yeah I mean plural
My boy got a knife to turn a boy into a girl
We'll fuck up your world, no boos to my drama
We'll include yo mama, if you f**k with my commas
I ain't tryin' to scary you
I ain't tryin' to hear you
I ain't tryin' to control that nigga in the mirror
I'll I'm tryin' to is bark before I fight
Before I take you down, might as well be polite

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Now when I roll through the hood, lil' kids watch my every move
Tryin' to be a good example, don't make me bury you
If you sit on my swagger, bitch take some carellflu
Don't underestimate the damage caused by a '22
Pop yo' ass right behind the ear within' hear
Nothin' like a firecracker, hits you like a linebacker
Don't forget the grind factor, I am a grinder
And here's a reminder, ain't no tellin' where they find ya
Now what this got to do with the price of tea in China?
Nothin' motherfucker just don't act like a vagina
You won't catch the rath of this hardcore rhymer
Now you got 55 niggas right behind ya
Now you wanna talk it out, but we don't negotiate
Now you gotta do all kind of shit that we know you hate
Straight from the west and we got to be respected
Here it's going down, here 'em runnin' for the exit

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Doughboy]
See this boy in this bitch gonna ape shit
Glitch Mob niggas takin' off like a spaceship
Pace those to Euros, eatin' those green and great chips
Get 'em by the bag, you can say we Feedo Lay chips
I'm so hungry that I can eat these niggas faces
Beat the plastic surgeons givin' Hollywood a face lift
Off the grape shit, and I'm feelin' like I'm faceless
The Mob you ain't in, nigga don't say shit
You ain't nothin' to play with, nigga I beat the basics
Cock and spray shit, quick to leave a nigga faceless
Playin' Superman, we get a brave nigga sprayed quick
Niggas can't fade this, music for the ages
Because we get it in like Young Crush
She be payin' big fishin'
In the water bitch you in the deep end
Boy I pull you deep in, underneath the deep end
Nigga have you sinkin', when I hear you creepin', hear you sayin'

I'ma be a killer, yup a urban guerrilla,
I'ma stack strilla, yeah, buy me a villa,

I don't give a fuck that she look like thriller,
Hit that shit, one more time and fuck around and kill her.
Cause I got the heart of a Pittsburgh Steeler,
Black nigga, draped in gold with a nine milla,

Love money, love jail, love that penitentiary mail,
Love the way these niggas smell, keep comin' back, can't you tell,
Love to see my mama cry, love to see my babies struggle,
Love to see my woman juggle nuts cause she got the hustle,

I don't give a fuck, how my life go,
Now I'ma slave man to this cave man, without Geico
Everybody wanna a car, Michael a psycho
But he ain't never came through the hood with a rifle,

Hit the wrong person cause we shoot just like hoes,

I'ma gonna be that little fool, coming in your living room,

I wanna be like Tiger Woods, swing that club, make you sick,
I wanna be like Pacman Jones, I wanna be like Michael Vick,

Go kiss Oprah's ass, if you wanna be Gail,
I rather have my ass kissed, up in Bloomingdale,
You can go, be a pimp, you can go, be a hoe,

I'm sitting next to your ass and cant hear what you got to say

Them fuckers cheat like an NBA ref
If you smoke one now,
They'll electrocute you to death
I got god on my intellect

So sour-puss niggas, can drink lemonade
I'm doin' it for the love
You doing it because
You need that advancement to spend on them dubs
I don't need a penny, but I need many
Don't worry bout ma money boi, cause I got plenty
You motherfuckers worry bout flossing so much
You don't know the fundamentals, you forgot how to brush
These thirty-two teeth
Will give your ass grief
Bite you like a fat burger if you got beef

Made by the Nero, look like a zero,
Shine the spotlight, this is my night,
Get your cameras ready, let it rain confetti,
I'm a champion, I do what can't be done,
In the real league nerd, not the fantasy one
Throw your hands up, you can cheer for your boy,
When I hit the stage get an ear full of noise,
When I bring the noise from here to Illinois,
Motherfuckers love when I do what it does,
A all-star, superstar entertainer,
World class, first ballot hall-of-famer,
Some rappers claim that they got a heart full of anger,
How when your lyrics weren't written by a stranger,
Fool I'm the greatest, you just the latest,
I'm loved by your grand mama, and your baby

[Chorus]
See my head is so big they call me jack in the box,
You can't impress me, so fuck what you got,
I said my head is so big they call me jack in the box,
Don't talk about money cause I'm stacking a lot,

I was a born loser, I was a born sinner,
Now I am a winner, in a convincing sinner,
I got to take a bow, cause I still wonder how,
The system didn't get me when I was a juvenile,
Just think if I had got locked up,
No Boyz in da Hood thanks to America,
No Eazy, NWA, no 'Friday',
Don't let your motherfucking talent go to waste,
Don't catch a case cause these people got a place,
To throw your life away and take you right out the waste,
Throw your hands up, you got to man up,
I had to show the world, what I was made of,
What you say Blood, I was a slad cause,
Now I'm V.I.P., up in Vegas,
I'm up in Nike-town, so how you like me now,
See the whole industry had to bite my style,

Now mama don't be mad I got to show my ass,
And thanks these motherfuckers for my past,

C'mon y'all

Stand tall, live your life to the limit
Cause haterism seem like a fucking epidemic
And look at Ice Cube, I ain't no gimmick
I'm straight from the hood, I got to represent it
Now, every day I think about my color
And all the crazy shit we do to one another
I ain't your blood brother, but I'm your cause brother
Let's take it back to the love and how it was brother
If not, we goin' pull these triggers
Show the world we deserve to be called niggas
I make a fuck-up, like Don Imus
Bow on his knees, and call me yo' highness
You can too, you got the power to
Don't let this motherfucking system devour you
I won't pretend, or act like I'm knowing you
But check it out I understand what you going through

But remember, brothers and sisters
You can still, stand, tall
Just be thankful
For what you got

I know what y'all motherfuckers thinking, heh heh
Here comes another rapper with a song about hope
All you wanna hear is a song about dope
And how a nigga got mo' money than the Pope
But he'll never tell you when he drop the soap
No~! Ice Cube is here to drop you a note
Cause some of our folk used to hang from ropes
And some of our people used to hang from trees
Now the only thing hangin' motherfucker is these
So, get your mind right, and I'ma rhyme right
Fuck the limelight, and a blind dyke
I'm the sunlight, too bright to look
When it's all said and done I should write the book
You too cool for school, too old to know?
Get your ass off the grassroots and let 'em grow
I understand, it ain't no love lost
But little kids, it ain't no Santa Claus

[Chorus]

Yeah, for real
I was born in the mud but I came out clean
That's 'til the government tried to intervene
Tried to lock me up when I was only 19
Don't never ever ever let 'em kill your dream
I make shit raw that piss off the law
If you want some fake shit turn this off
If you want some realness I know you can feel this
Maybe we can heal this just like an illness
Black on black, I got your back
People don't think that we know how to act
Just because our neighborhood is filled with crack
And the CIA, won't take it back
Never on top, always on the bottom
Never put your trust in Hillary Rodham
Cause I can tell you now it's goin' turn out rotten
Keep on pushin', get 'em 'til we got 'em

Stand up, for real
Raise your hand if you sick of this bullshit

All we get is vomit, come like a comet
Put it in my brain Lord, put it in my stomach
Only you can do it, I'ma learn from it
Do what I gotta do, try not to plum it
America used to shoot like reptiles
Don't worry tomorrow, let's get this right now
They wanna run us in the ground
Educate yourself, before they dumb you down
Get your money boy, the legal way
Beat 'em with they own bullshit if you may
Now rich white men they got the world fucked up
Why should I give a fuck about a Styrofoam cup
Environmental saying, but if I go green
You know what I mean bitch

Ice Cube for President, let's just do it for the hell of it
See how I run the government
Make money irrelevant
I might tell a chick, it's illegal to resell of it
Secret service don't know where the hell I went
Sorry yall, I had to fuck a super delicate
Dream ticket, Ice Cube and Obama
American dream, Ice Cube and yo mama
The Terminator, are you Sarah Conner?
Arnold Schwarzenegger, can kill who he wanna
In California, they strap you to a jury
And murder your ass, in front of your attorney
Do you really wanna take this journey?
And scared of none of yall, motherfuckers like Bernie
Mad step back, I got the mac 11
Unlike Obama, I'ma have to back my Reverend

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now the Lord is my Sheppard
My flow is respected, world wide
In the west I got to rep it
So please check it, cause my style is infected
With the virus, Ice Cube's the ocyeros
I bailed through, they wanna put up in bail view
Cause my point of view is not red, white and blue
It's black and blue residue
I know what crack can do, to a whole fuckin' avenue
Spit on it, and they'll get mad at you
You know I do this bullshit for your gratitude
I'ma nigga with a attitude
I'ma do what I gotta do, just to change my latitude
In the system, rollin' with my diamonds glistening
And niggas listenin', from your local prison
I'ma prism, your only vision is a rainbow in the sky
When I spit the ism

[Chorus]",Take Me Away
Ice Cube,"I do gangsta Rap
They want to blame the world problems on Gangsta Rap
It's our fault,
Cause motherfuckers are dieing in Iraq
It's our fault,
Cause motherfuckers is starving in Africa
It's Gangsta Raps fault,
That people are poor
Can't get enough to fucking eat or live their life
(That's bullshit)
That's rap musics fault.
It's rap musics fault,
We got all these god damn laws, and restrictions and shit we can't do
(That's bullshit)
They blame it all on us
I'm blamin' them motherfuckers for Gangsta Rap
Because if they didn't create these kind of conditions
I wouldn't have shit to rap about
You know what I mean!

A'right, a'right, everybody back up, star status comin' through.
The man is in the building.
Don't touch him, don't look at him, and don't ask to take a picture.

I walks in, with that California swagger
With that attitude that it ain't nothin' badder
Now you can call me rapper
Or you can call me mister
Big money trapper, fuckin' with your sister
I'ma do it my way, from here to Zimbabwe
It's too hot today
Fuck what you got to say
Fuck if you mad at me, better go change your battery
Ain't gon' take my sunshine, like I hit the lottery
Ah, he's a show off, a hot head go off
Yeah don't make he mad
He might tear the fucking door off
Take all his cars, and don't try to fall
Cause one of his people, might cut your fucking toe off
Ice Cube baby, make you take him serious
Everthin' I say, ends with a period
Everthin' I do, ends with you curious
Lookin' for the best rapper
God damn period.

The West coast warlord, and the future is today

Cause tomorrow, that shit never come
I worry 'bout today and this urban decay
I worry 'bout hip-hop, when did it flip-flop
Get whack, and turn into gridlock
I don't know is it a government plot?
I don't give a fuck whether you love it or not
That's all we got and if you throw it away
You dumb as OJ, off a forty
In your Izod, this the rap God
What you goin' put up, in your iPod?
Downloader, what you go/in' do
When your favorite MC, got to sue you
Cause he got to eat ain't nothin' taboo
Get your ass beat by Erykah Badu
Cause you wanna steal this good music
Put me out of business, now you lose it

Tomorrow, don't you worry about tomorrow (that shit never come)
This is very hard to swallow
Keep your hand up on that throttle
Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow

Tomorrow, I'ma handle my business
But today, I'ma drink this liquor
Cause tomorrow, I might be a little quicker
But today, I'm just the same old nigga
You know that shit is still a day away
Do yo' thing baby put your life on layaway
Cause everybody is Nostradamus
Boy don't you know that tomorrow ain't promised?
To all the lil' mamas
Don't do a nigga, like Isiah Thomas

Don't you, get stuck in neutral
Put your shit in drive, while you still alive cause

Tomorrow! That shit never come

I'm up in the Range when the clock strikes 1
While y'all countin' sheep, I'm countin' Benjamins
Up on my feet at the break of the sun

We don't go to war, we go to the store
We rob from the rich, and give to the poor

Lettin college motherfuckers run the front door
(Fuck that!) Let's take it back to the streets
Don't let Viacom, dictate the heat

Askin' me about, my urban spins
And if I got about, a thousand of them

Your punk ass never heard of me
I never did nothin' to your family
Still you wanna kill a young nigga randomly
You wanna take the life God handed to me

Scary bitch with a gun that ain't a man to me
That's an animal,
A fucking cannibal
I'm Duranimo and Hannibal

What you goin' tell 'em, when you get to heaven
When he asks you why did you send back his present.
Who the fuck are you, you motherfucking peasant
Even got the nerve to ask the man for a blessing.
Send his ass to Hades with his big Mercedes

Before you shoot me man think about it
Lets go have a drink about it
Before you make a stink about it
Man lets talk about it
Maybe we can walk about it.
But just don't be a coward
And take my life 'cause you got the power
Of the white mans gun powder
Cause you might face a gun tower.
And time never run out,
They take the fun out, til your life run out.
So don't pull your gun out,
If you ever want a house, just like Run's house.
It's better than a big house,
Less four-five some woman we can dig out,
Find a place we can dig out,
Party all night til the owner say 'get out'

Used to get straight-As, now she's just skippin' class.
Oh my, do I love to grip the hips and ass.
Only 17, with a lot of practice on black boys' jimmys and white boy's cactus.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, but I gotta be brief:
A lotta niggas like bustin' nuts in her teeth.
Drink it up, drink it up, even though she's Catholic,
That don't mean shit, 'cause she's givin' up the ass quick.

Can take on three men built like He-Men;
Her little-bitty twat got gallons of semen.

I'm gonna do my thing, with your dauuuughter!

I'm here to let you know your little girl is a hoe.
Nympho, nympho, boy is she bad; get her all alone and out come the kneepads.
I know she's a minor and it is illegal,
But the bitch is worse than Vanessa Del Rio.
And if you decide to call rape, we got the little hooker on tape, now:
Tell the fuckin' slut to please hurry up,
And wear that dress that's tight on her butt,
So I can finger-fuck on the way to the bed,
Been in so many rooms, she got a dot on her forehead.
Face turnin' red from grabbin' them ankles.
Fuck and get up is how I do them stank-hoes.
You should hear how she sounds with a cock in her,
Boots get knocked from here to Czechoslovakia.
Two on top, one on the bottom;
First nigga got the boots, man, you shoulda shot 'im.
'cause after I got 'em it was over. Now niggas get lucky like a four-leaf clover.
On daddy's little girl.

I can sell you anything

I got to get out, I'm getting put out of my house
I got to pack up, my refrigerator and couch
It's a set up, but the bank wants me out
Or the L.A.P.D. will smoke me out
This suggestible weight, it choke me out
They gave me a loan and I had no clout
They gave me a house, for me and my spouse
Call my momma and my aunt,
Y'all should re-finance,
I let them dance with the devil,
Dig their own grave and I gave them the shovel
Fuck, my daddy built that house
And when he got drunk he almost killed that house
Is this the American dream, or the American scheme?
That got me walking in these American streets?
Its kinda sad when you have to get a hernia,
Cause you help your grand mama move her furniture

If I can sell you the American dream, 
I can sell you anything

Look at this maggot, with a stimulus package
I can give a fuck about a Dow Jones average
What the fuck you do when your paycheck is average?
Law abiding citizen turn into a savage,
Got to feed the children, got to feed the habit
Fell into a rabbit hole, chasing that rabbit
Now I'm in wonderland feeling like the Son of Sam
I'm at your west coast branch, gun in hand
I'ma feel like superman,
Walk by the teller, better call the trooper, man
It's the revenge of the lambs,
""big bad wolf, we're sick of these scams""
Sick of these plans, sick of this dance
Walk into his office took the nine out my pants
You're not a man, you're a serpent
Then I pray to God nigga nine get to workin'

I never get the working
You know I heard they hood robbin', 
Your money or your life and there ain't no stoppin' 'em,
I never get the working
You know I heard they hood robbin',
Your money or your life and there ain't no stoppin' 'em,
Ain't that a bitch,
When you got to steal from the poor, 
And give to the rich
Ain't that a bitch,
When you got to steal from the poor, 
And give to the rich

Uh, drug dealer M.D.
Doctor feel good, give you what you need
In California, prescribe that weed
Oxycontin and codeine
Turn your grand mama into a fiend
And see the cyanide first hit ain't free
I know you bout to die, but let me see your I.D.
I know you bout to lie, but can you pay this fee?
If you can't pay, then please have a seat
You can't see a doctor but you could see a priest
We can't save your life until we get some insurance
Your premium is paid, add that insurance
I hope you got endurance,
They got me on hold and I'm under they influence
Nurse high as a kite,
In charge with my life,
And everything is lost,
Without blue cross

You know I heard they hood robbin', 
Your money or your life and there ain't no stoppin' 'em,

Tiger woods used to be a safe nigga
Go ahead let your daughter have a date with him
He'll mate wit 'em prolly in a wifebeater

When they come to L.A. they gotta learn they lesson
When they come to west coast it's such an obsession
When they come to play it out I'm just an exception

(Are you famous?) My resume is heaven's way
of tellin y'all that God will make a way
I rock a motherfuckin mic 'til the break of day

Microphone fiend with that guillotine killer team
You motherfuckers won't amount to a hill of beans
When I ride by, well over 35
Y'all still run and hide, scared of a driveby

I ain't ghetto, don't you know, I'm urbanian
Google me bitch, wanna know, what my name is
I ain't ghetto, don't you know, I'm urbanian

Won'tcha Google me bitch, try to Google me this

Your little ass is kind of churban, and propane
Your little flame is like a flicker
And my bang, is off the motherfuckin Richter
I'm hard liquor
Cirrohsis of the liver
Black lung is what I deliver
That's what you get, if you ever try to smoke the nigga
Don't provoke a nigga, I'm from that urban community
Lookin for some unity, fuckin you and me
I only bang shit true to me
With iced out jewelry, what can they do to me?
Nothin, I only bang shit true to me
With iced out jewelry, what can they do to me?

[Verse 1]
Real People walk in the streets, the streets is talkin'
Often it's beef this city never does
People walk and talk in they sleep
Cold sweats and wet dreams
On how to get green our faith is all in a jeep
Black souls raw and they deep
Hypes tryin' to talk with no teeth
Shorties sayin' ball or retreat
A lesson we all speak at one point or another
What you expect from one who smoke a joint with his mother
Anointed hustlers in a fatherless region
Through the pain wish they know that God was just teachin'
We want decent homes
So dreams we say out loud like speaker phones just to keep em on
It's like a colored song that keep keepin' on
I guess knowin' I'm weak is when I'm really bein' strong
Somehow through the dust I could see the dawn
Like the Bishop Magic Juan, that's why I write freedom songs
For the real people

[Verse 2]
I wonder is the spirits of Bob Marley and Haile Selassie
Watch me as the cops be tryin' to and pop and lock me
They cocky, plus they mentality is Nazi
The way they treat blacks I wanna snap like paparazzi
We're the children of a better God searchin' for better jobs
We could cop ghetto cars tryin' not to catch a charge
They say the dope game is sour
Now they doin' homework that's when they follow you for hours
Come to your crib and devour all that you work for
Must be more than paper these niggas hurt for
Through the purple haze I circle days I rhyme that work for pays
Tryna reverse the slave's mind and insert the brave mentality
Heard that it's drama at home
Can a dude break free and still get honored at home
I was told by a chief it's the games nature
When you're glowin' some will love and some will hate ya
It's real people

[Verse 3]
Black men walking wit white girls on they arms
I be mad at em as if I know they moms
Told to go beyond the surface, a person's a person
When we lessen our women our condition seems to worsen
The weary cursin' the sky
Talkin' to themselves givin' the version of why help and hurt in they eye
I live across from it, some of it I do be in
I be showin' niggas lives
Like UPN

No womans ever touch me in your mind like that 
I gotta gotta get you there's no ifs or buts 
'Cause you the prima donna plus l'm tired of sluts 
Is your name Christina, Deddie or Edwina 
Sonia or Trisha, Cavoline or Divina 
I've seen her in the supermarket round the corner 
Paying for shampoo and some Evian water 
Definitely looking after that little body 
It had enough power to take out a whole army 
I'm barmy out of my mind this time 
I got to have you for my woman cause your so damn fine 

Tell me tell me tell me? 

l'd give you what you want and make you feel like a lady 
Give you good loving and l'd feed it to you daily 
Do it in the shower in the closet cause l'm adle 
Do it in the kitchen underneath the round tadle 
No I wouldn't rush it l'd be cool and chill 
Do it real slow 'cause I know I got skill 
Massage your body and your mind and your soul 
Making you happy is my mission 
Make you happy's my goal 
I'm true when I say like you there's no other 
'Cause you make Cindy Crawford look 
Like the Queen's Mother

Cause somethings gonna happen 
When his thing meets with a stranger 
You gyal well cris no make her walk street alone

L'm sure l'm gonna buck her up again real soon

In the area you stand out from the rest 
I want to show you why I have a big ""D"" on my chest

Use  miracle whip,I don't like mayonnaise

About 1 a.m.,I always.....

Whole days of my life are spent inside my bed

Ya  say you like this record,you think it's fun?
Party people get stupid we just begun!!!

You're get,get,gettin' real stupid
As the beat hits your body get ill!!!

Go on homeboy and grab her.....

No time to waste just dog the place

To places close to home,far away

Evil E's his name
If you can't see who's rockin' you must be blind
You better clean your gazelles with some 409!!!

Go Ice get busy (x2)
Go Evil Get busy (X2)

Turn up your stereo,equalize treble
Bass be kickin' stupid hard as metal
On the mic tonight that's right your rhyme opponent
M.C. Ice T just microphonin'
33 and 1/3 revolutions per minute
This record is def because my heart is in it
Vocals laid by the Ice,tempos tight and precise
Special effects will be created by an editor's splice
The funk is in it,ya dig it so stop that frontin'
Bust a move to my groove work your body do somethin'
No way in the world that you can deny my method
As my record rotates,my words get more impressive
I'm an M.C., Evil's my Dj on Sire Records not M.C.A.
C.B.S.,Capitol,cause they move too slow
Now Sire/Warner Bros. clocks all the dough
As the record revolves money's gettin' made
A.S.C.A.P. pays me every time it's played
I chill in def leathers pure silks and suede
And the gold around my neck will never fade
Down with my Syndicate organized rhyme
Kickin' def tempos that I design
And if you can't hear'em that's such a crime
You better wash your dirty ears with some 409

I always rhyme elite,stay on beat
Travel in a posse when I walk the street
Loved to say  my rhymes when I used to max
Now I don't speak much,I save my words for wax
I just want to make a little point in this song
With a little nonsense we can all get along and on and on
Till the break'a break of dawn
This jam will never play out because the grooves too strong
Guys grab a girl,girls grab a guy
If a guy wants a guy,please take it outside
I want to make ya enjoy yourself
On the mic tonight Ice T!!Who else?
Evil's on the cuts,Henry Gee's shot gun
Islam's my producer,Bambattas son
Bronx Style Bob's cold watchin' my back
Melle Mel's  just layin' for some punks to act wack
Grandmaster Caz and Donald D ,Scott La Rock
Red Alert,Chuck Chill Out
If you're down with my crew you will be fine
But if you ill we'll get dirty-bring your 409!!

Ice-T,"Ya heard the Ice was rockin', ticket sales were high
Bought some fresh Adidas so you could look fly
Broke out from your crib rushin' to get here
Tripped ans stumbled almost broke your neck comin' down the stairs
Jumped into your ride, pushed the speed to the limit
Jumped out of your car faster than you jumped in it
Now you're at the jam but in for a shock
Stupid big line wrapped around the block
Through the walls of the hall you could hear me rhyme
Methodically you schemed a way to cut in line
But when you got inside the sight straightened your curls
Cause as you look around all you could see were girls

I love ladies

I think it's time that I tell the truth
I been dissin' females since my early youth
But you know that's a drag and there's no doubt
Cause females are the one thing that I can't do without
Female companionship is my one vice
I love to buy the girls things, love to treat em real nice
Homeboys you must admit the best part of each day
Is when a beautiful lady comes walkin' your way
Females possess that one commodity that no man will ever have
Not that hangs around me
They got it, we want it, they move it, and flaunt it
They shake it and sway it, we'll die just to lay it
We try to suppress it until they undress it
And beg 'em to use it, and cry not to lose it
No man can deny it so don't even try it!!!

I love ladies
Ladies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)
I Love Ladies
Ladies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)
That sounds nice (You know we love you Ice!!)

I'm junkie for females and that's a fact
I'm not into havin' my homeboys rubbin' my back
Don't dig goin' to the movies alone
Or talkin' to myself on the telephone
Goin' to a disco that's packed with men
That's like tryin' to get a dance in the federal pen
Walkin' through a park with a gang of the guys
And a beach full of fellas never opened my eyes
And man if females are one thing that you don't need
You better get away from me at a high rate of speed
Cause if you don't like them you must like men
And homeboy that's where our serious problems begin
Because to me women are God's true gift
There's absolutely no question who I'd rather be with

I love ladies

I seen this fly girl walkin' down the street
Jammin' a box rockin' to the beat
The girl looked pretty, she really looked nice
So I said to myself she's got to be with the Ice
Walked over to her, started sayin' my rhyme
She said ""Ice you're so bad, you damn near blew my mind""
I kept on rappin', runnin' my mouth
The next thing I knew I was at her house
Looked at her closely, said for goodness sake
The girl was cut like a diamond, had curves like a snake
Her top half was heaven, the bottom was the hell
I knew tonight that the Ice was gonna rock well
But then she started talkin' mess about love and romance
Until she noticed the bulge growin' in my pants
You should'a seen the girl's eyes as my body expanded
She grabbed for my leg, raw sex she demanded
My knees started knockin', I tried to run
She said ""Please don't leave Ice, I want you to come""
This girl meant business I had no doubt
This is just about the time that the Ice passed out
The next day I woke the girl was through
Room still smokin', my legs black and blue
My eyes bloodshot, my hair pressed straight
My knees still knockin', I knew I lost weight
She was the best y'all, yes on this earth
I would'a paid a million dollars, that's what it was worth
If I had got her name or number it would'a been nice
But I'm here to let you know the girl went off on the Ice

I love ladies
Ladies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)
I Love Ladies
Ladies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)
That sounds nice (You know we love you Ice!!)

No when it comes to partyin' the ladies know how
When I ask for a reply they always scream owww!!
It's the homeboys always tryin' to act real chill
Sometimes it's jealous MC's mad cause they ain't on the bill
Maybe they scared if they say ho!
They might lose their cool
But I got some news for you: a fool's a fool
But don't get me wrong, most fellas do rock
They put their hands in the air, they take the show to the top
They start rockin' with the ladies once the show begins
They don't stand lookin' stupid like some mannequins
They don't lean against the wall like they're I some trance
They did not come with no intention to party or dance
You know what? yo dead beats should just stay home
Leave me, my homeboys, and the ladies alone

We love ladies",I Love Ladies
Ice-T,"(Make it funky)
So the people can get down to the funky sound
Cause my crew don't mess around
(Make it funky)
So the girls can get busy,dog the dance floor
Make the guys get dizzy

Totally def as Evil E guts the records and the beat is kept
(Make it funky)

Stupid fly,it's got to the F-you-N-K why?
So that you can get loose as I produce sounds hard as the deuce
Manipulate the bass gain give the level's a boost
The lyric layer rhyme sayer,born to be player
If politics were my kick then I'd be your mayor
Governator,Senator,I'm your mentor
Rap rhythm is erratic,time is four, four
I'm the microphone scholar,clockin' long dollars
Here to make the place funky while the fly girls holler
Genius vocalist,rhyme style priceless
Pound of gold around my neck,mic in my first
The microphone virtuoso crazy insane I'm loco
With the speed to exceed,make other MC's look slow mo
Un-lease release words mean as a beast
I eat MC's for lunch and dinner,I can serve for a feast
Their rhymes are elementary,mine deserve a PH D
This beat is F-you-N-Key my name is Ice T 

Make it funky

Undoubtedly you recognize this jam is the ultimate cut
Uncontrollably you motivate and move your butt
It's rough the beat is gangsterous,call it tough
If you're diss'n stop frontin',come on what's up?
Complicated voice gymnastics are all in your face
Vegas got my highs,E.V's got control my bass
My break is comin' get busy no time ta waste
Now's the time do body work here's the place

Make it funky

Make it funky enough so the tracks lay tough
'Cause I'm tossin' it up and the Ice don't bluff
The girl charmer toy Harmer,juice strong as armor
When I stand upon the stage you could call it melodrama
Intense suspense my voice emcee
I wouldn't have you come and see me under false pretense
The girlies do be wild'n'as I'm profilin'
Limos lined around the block for about a mile'n'a half
Autographs the list goes on
If you forgot it ""make it funky"" is the name of this song
Stupid dope and you know it,it rates a ten
You pray my DJ cuts the records so it starts again
'Cause I can keep the mic cookin' for an entire month
My rhymes are always hard hittin' I don't know how to bunt
My DJ cuts like a laser E-V-I-L-E
Put your finger on the records
Make it,Make it funky

Ice-T,"Deuce,deuce revolver was my problem solver
Had a def girl,really didn't want to involve her
In the life of a gangster,use to rob bankster
But now I'm locked up,I'm just a punk low rankster
Jail cells know me too damn well
Seems like I've built on earth my own personal hell
No matter how high I climbed,somehow I always fell
I guess a lot of players got this story to tell
No matter how cold you roll you simply cannot win
It's always fun in the beginning
But pain in the end

Pain (x4)

Organized crimer,big trouble finder
In and out of institutions ever since I was a minor
But now I'm on the bricks,deep in the mix
Crime smarts searching hard for some new street tricks
I think I'll join a gang,sling a little cane
Put a beeper on my belt and get myself a name
Fresh sneakers,silk shirts,24/7 work
Nine to five to survive,you gotta be a jerki 
I clock two grand a day,yet I was born to play
Who me at micky dee's?It wouldn't work,no way
I'm a  big money haver but not the last laugher
For me infamy makes me no autographer
Custody haunts my dreams,nightmares of capture
Paranoid of surveillance,phobia of cameras
My banks bigger,but so are my fears
Past records proved players live limited years
But I'm unlike the rest,know to be the best
Fast money,true wealth my eternal quest
I hustle all night long,there ain't no gain in rest
12 gauge close range,bloods on my chest
I looked into his face,I thought he was my friend
My boy had me set up,this wound would never mend
No matter who you trust,you simply cannot win
It's always fun in the beginning
But it's pain in the end

Pain (x4)

Gold rope wearer,neighborhood terror
Can't hang around my mother 'cause she says I scare her
Got a light sunburn from too much pool-side sittin'
Coroless phone keeps me on 'cause there ain't no quittin'
Mind's in a money mode,seems like it should explode
Girlies on my jammie,got a female overload
Young street messiah,professional liar
19 gotta Benz,21 I'll retire
Crazy money it ain't funny,suckers lovin' my jock
But there's some people at my door that didn't even knock
Task force boomin',doggin' my crib out,can't shout
F.B.I. got a gun in my mouth!
Threw me on the floor,called my girl a whore
Pulled ten G's out my mattress and was lookin' for more
Cracked my safe with an axe,then illed out to the max
When they seem my money kickin' it in twenty G stacks
Booked me on ten counts,with bails of different amounts
The charges stuck like glue,some that I couldn't pronounce
They threw my ass the book,my life wa surely took
And then they gave my girl 
Ten years for hangin' out with a crook
She played the game herself,fast lane quick wealth
No respect for the law or the city's health
The sweat of hustlers greed is not reserved for men
It's always fun in the beginning
But it's pain in the end

I was in a contest to rock the world
First prize was a virgin young girl
For four days I was up on the mic
All sucker MC's were on the bite
Bittin' my rhymes,stealin' my style
I rocked so hard,it wasn't true
I won the virgin girl,and her MAMA too

Sex (x4)

When I'm upon the microphone
All the fly young ladies want a take me home
When the party's over,take me to their house
Throw me in the bed,know what we're talkin' about?
Then they say,""Ice-T you are the best
I love your eyes
Your things,your chest
You put all my lovers to shame
I can't remember my boyfriends name
You made me feel all hot and wet
The way you move I can't forget
I came,I came,I came again it felt so good I told my friends
You can have my cars,my jewels,my wealth
I love you more than I love myself
After tonight fulfilled I'll be
No hundred men could match ICE-T

Then she turn out the lights,throw back the sheets
And then our two hot bodies meet
And all at once she felt the thrill
The caress of the best,the Ice-T chill
Start with her tongue upon the back of my leg
She didn't stop till I hollered screamed and begged
Then she rolled me over,took me to the stage
Like in the nasty book where you tore out the page

Sex (x4)

I put it in their blouse
In their brain their little panties that their boyfriend saw
I put it in their mini skirt and up their thigh
Deep,deep girls,I want to make you cry
I move it in and out,know what I'm talkin' about
Then around your neck until you show respect
Then on your cheek until I reach my peak
Then in your mouth girl,no joke,I'll take it out
Don't want to see you choke
I'll run it down your back,might cause a heart attack
I'll put it in your butt until I get enough
And then I'll take it out and put it in my pants
'Cause I fuck with the beat,the only way to dance

So much gold that jewelry don't phase me
Coroless phone,eight or nine homes
Girlies on my Jammie with Ice-T Jones
Bank account boomin', fast lane zoomin'
Known around the world for my high post groomin'
Mac like a preacher,love like a teacher
Got a girl who lives in Paris
When I want her I beep her
Too many clothes,gotta rag top rolls
1,000 Watt system and my speakers are bose
I kick it like a champ,I throught you knew it
But pimpin' ain't easy

My thumbs are tired just from countin' cash

Monograms on my underwear

But somebody's gotta do it
When I walk in a joint,punks always look at me hard
Because I wear enough gold to tie a dog in a yard
Cold maxin' in my mansion so big it's silly
Got a butler named Humphry and a maid named Milly
Mink sheets on my bed,that's what I said
Gourmet chefs in my kitchem so that I can get fed
So tired of sailin' on my boat I might just Helicopter
To my jet and catch a midnight flight
So many girls in my book,it weighs a tom
Gotta leave the damn country just to have some fun

Rampage on stage,my crews in a rage
Searched my posse,found the Uzi but missed the 12 gauge
Maniac,I'm a rhyme brainiac,livin' on the edge of a razor
Remember that
Cold rollin' thick as a shake,I'm rockin' hard as a quake
I can't live on bread and water or lobster and steak
My mino's a riot gun,there ain't none bigger
About to unload the ammo,""E"" squeeze the trigger

They say I'm violent,they should watch their T.V.
They say I'm brutal,they should check their P.D.
You made me,now your kids rave me
I rap about the life that the city streets gave me
Murder,intrigue,somebody must bleed
Miami Vice is small time,L.A's the big league
From the rollin' 60's  to the nickerson ""G""
Pueblos,grape street,this is what I see
The jungle,the 30's,the V.N.G.
Life in L.A. ain't no cup of ter
  
Squeeze the trigger
  
I've been dogged out by cops,shackled and socked
Paid my dues to the streets,took my hard knocks
Disrespected by snobs,damn near trampled by mobs
Persecuted by  squares workin' nine to five jobs
Like a panther I prowl ,like a lion I growl
Learn to see behind my back like the head of an owl
I'm the voice of the youth,the prophet of truth
What I speak is really  though some 
May say ruthless tactics are takin' by me to awaken
People  to life but I feel no fakin'
No jivin',no lyin',no frontin',no playin'
Say exactly what's up,understand what I'm sayin'
Ban me,try it,you might cause a riot
What the radio won't play,the underground will supply it
I'm a MC pirate that's loud not quiet
Radical as they make'em,make a rule I'll defy it
Critics may say I'm wise,some may call my words lies
I've lived more in one day than they will in their lives
But most do respect the words I inject
Kick credit for realism and the truth I project
Because I could bust rhymes for fun,or cut MC's like a knife
But the topic I love is the drama of life
So don't diss me don't dare,I feel you should care
You may think I'm soft but you're just unaware
Of the wrath of the Ice enraged  prepare

What is crime and what in not?what is justice?I think I forgot

Reagan sends guns where they don't belong
The controversy is thick and the drag is strong
But no matter  the lies we all know who's wrong
Homeless sleep on the city streets
Waitin' to die with nothin' to eat
While rich politicians soak their feet
In the pools at their ten million buck retreats
People hate people for color of face
No one had a choice in the race we were placed
A brother in queens was beaten and chased
Murdered cold in the streets, a goodamn disgrace
Just because of his race,his life went to waste
And no one went to jail when the court heard the case
Justice or corruption?it's all interlaced
How can you swallow this?I can't stand the taste

Dust is burnin', the steering wheel's turnin'
I'm out a week, I'm already earnin'
Suckers crossed, tonight it's their loss
Payback time, boy, life's the cost
Gauges out the window, one lay cross the roof
They all die if them suckers ain't bullet proof
I'm rollin' death tollin', of course the car's stolen

I keep a bank for that don't know about the rest
Copped another piece, hit the dark streets
Rollin' once again, fuck the damn police
Called up my boy Joe, a roof job pro, 459 on his mind car stereos
He said the spot was sleep, he cased the joint a week
3 a.m. on the dot, inside we creep

I stuck to my alias, I know the game
If they don't know who you are, then they don't know what you've done
""You're just makin' this harder on yourself, son""
I know this shit by heart, I'm too clever
""Have you ever been arrested before?""

He dropped the mallet, then the judge laughed
Now I'm in the penzo, chillin' like a real pro
I can't move until the man says go
A puppet of the big game, an institutional thing
I wouldn't be here if I fed my brain
Got knowledge from school books, instead of street crooks
Now all I get is penitentiary hard looks
The joint is like an oven of caged heat
You're just a number, another piece of tough meat
Killers and robbers are all you great
Act soft you will get beat
On death row they got their own hot seat
For those who feel that they are truly elite
The last thing you see's a priest
The lights dim, your life ends

With 10.000 screamin' people, now that's the pill
Who's gonna dog the set? The ICE will
And once I'm in effect it's overkill
Kinda like a hold-up all the tickets sold up
And then the black stretch limo cold rolls up
And then the posse breaks, high off the Cold Duck
And then I set the mic to show destruct

Raps hittin' so hard, you'll think you shot
I'll take a show and abduct it
Stone cold house it, if it gets wild

Here I am 'bout to steal another show
So they turn my mic down
Fuck up my audio sound
But too late, we just dogged another town
Rappin' like a Mac 10, as soon as I begin
The only way to stop the stealin'
Is throw me in the pen
But that will never happen
'Cause I'm just cool rappin'
My Larceny is legal, so sorry Captain
I would never steal a style or ever steal a rap
But I'll steal a show in a minute

But I'm coolin', I'm never foolin', too busy rulin'
Sucker emcees who need microphone schoolin'
Leave 'em dazed, dogged, served and droolin'
By the playin' punk slayin' mac of microphone duelin'

This conglomeration is just a demonstration
Of rap's penetration to the core of our nation
Some rappers get down with toy commercial sounds
I had my choice, I chose the underground
Like me or hate me, now if you want you can rate me
My beat is by ISLAM, the cut's by the great E. 
My heartbeat is kickin', it's kickin' louder and louder
It's gettin' deafer and deafer, I'm feelin' prouder and prouder
Not robbin', killin', just mic illin'
The phone rings, ""we made another million""
Break out the Dom and pop the corks
I catch a flight to New York
Hit the L. Q., watch RED spin, ""it's closed""
Brooklyn strikes again

Once again, my friends, it's time to rock it 'til the party ends
Rhymin' with timin', as EVIL E lets the record spin
Kickin' it, hittin', rockin', just so dope it's shockin'
'Cause I be layin' rhymes super sly, 'cause this is do or die
Make it or break it, although most emcees do fake it
I'll say the ICE can't take it, time to microphone bake it
Raise the heatin' level, break out your coal shovel
Pump the temp, I'm sweatin' like a devil
Listen to my heartbeat, it's beatin' like a wild man
But that's natural, 'cause you know that I am
No punk, no chump, no fool, no toy
Try to get ill and serve you, boy",Heartbeat
Ice-T,"Speed of life, fast, it's like walkin' barefoot over broken glass
It's like, jumpin' rope on a razor blade
All lightning quick decisions are made
Lifestyle plush, females rush
This high profile personality, who earns his pay illegally
Professional liar, schoolboys admire
Young girls desire, very few live to retire
Cash flow extreme, dress code supreme, vocabulary obscene
Definition-street player, you know who I mean
  
High rollers

Yeah the high rollers, street hustlers
Fast money, fast life
But you don't care, 'til you end up with a bullet in your head, boy
  
People of the city, stop foolin' yourself
Crime rules the streets, who the hell else
All the police have gone out to play
Because for enough cold cash they'll look the other way
Look at the cars as they roll by
Benz, Ferraris, trucks up high
Beepers connecting players to big-time deals
With all of this technology who needs to steal
Just live a life of leisure every night and day
And you're livin' proof that crime does pay
Your life is dangerous and reckless
You eat fly guys and girls for breakfast
You're a titan of the nuclear age
Your muscles flex with a Uzi or 12 gauge
And you love the game, that's why you boast
Because you're high priced, high speed high post
  
High roller
  
That's right, you're high rollin'
You think you got it goin' on right?
You got money, cars, jewelry 
You think you got everything
Lemme tell you, you ain't got nothin'
You ain't got nothin' but a one way ticket to death row
You gotta get out of the game man
Or the game is gonna get you

Now when I say high rollers, I mean the best
Forget the half-steppers, eject the rest
Because these high ranked officials of our city streets
Make millions all triggered by electric beeps
They dress in diamonds and rope chains
They got the blood, Scarface runnin' through their veins
Silk shirts, leather suits, hair always fresh
Eelskin boots, large hearts, though their sizes vary
Bankrolls that take 2 pockets to carry
Cruisin' in their 500 Benz Sedan
With their systems peaked out rockin' ""Pusher Man""
Yes, their fashion's high but hard to beat
They buy their GUCCI at GUCCI'S, not the swap-meet
Eat very well, much clientele
Whatever you need, they probably sell
  
High rollers

Yeah and let me break it down for the ladies
All you girls out there that think you gon' get that quick money and ain't goin' to jail
You better think again
  
Oh yes, I'm here to tell you females also roll
Drive the same cars, sometimes wear more gold
Cold as a igloo, or hot as a flame
They'll shake ya, break ya and you won't know their name
Gangsters to the max, all marks will be taxed
These girls drive Ferrari's not Cadillacs
Respect is demanded, most men don't understand it
Till they peep the huge bank that these girls have landed
They're junkies for fun, love life on the run
And if things get hot, they will pull a gun
Prey on the lame, no shame to the game
And they all seek power, fuck the fame
  
The high rollers
Yeah, the high rollers
Street hustlers, the players
Out there getting that long money, you know what I'm sayin'
But that fast money leads to a fast life and a quick death
This is my word, this is Ice-T
And I ain't got no reason to lie to you
  
Now radio stations probably won't play
This record because of the things I say
They'll say I'm glamorizing the hustlin' hood
And a record like this can do no good
But I'm not here to tell ya right or wrong
I don't know which side of the law you belong
  
Yes, the game has flash but sometimes hurts
Behind any mistake, hard times lurks
And jail's not your only problem, though it may seem
You just may die by a barrage from a M-16
But to each his own, choose you mobile phone
Choose a tailored suit, the luxury home
You'll never get caught, 'cause you got nerves of ice
And you're much smarter than those crooks on Miami Vice
Right

You wanna be a high roller",High Rollers
Ice-T,"Yo, it's time for me to pump the volume
No problem, the record's revolvin'
Evil's the mixer, I'm the rap trickster
Paparazzi on the bum rush for pictures
Ice, coolin', yo colder than ever
Punk executioner, E pull the lever
Rotate the wax, then cut and axe the tracks
Push up the levels 'til the red lights max
Don't try to size up, you better wise up
To the rap criminals, we're on the rise up
We're sellin' dope 'til we're succeeded 
Dope beats and lyrics, no beepers needed
For this drug deal, I'm the big wheel
The dope I'm sellin', you don't smoke, you feel
Out on the dance floor, on my world tour
I'm sellin' dope in each and every record store
I'm the king pin when the wax spins
Crack or smack will take you to a sure end
You don't need it, just throw that stuff away
You wanna get high? Let the record play

I know you're lovin' this drugs as it's comin' out your speaker
Bass through the bottoms, highs through the tweeters
But this base you don't need a pipe
Just a tempo to keep you hype
Groovin' like I see you doin'
Some stupid crack would just ruin
Your natural high, why? That ain't fly
And anyone who says it is, lies
Move like I knew you would, like I knew could
And if you ain't cracked out, then I know you should
Be able to give me a clap, to match exact with the track
And since I know that you ain't, I expect that
Oh now this jam is lit, it's like the ultimate
People high off dope but still physically fit
I'll make a million bucks, pack my dough in trucks
From sellin' dope beats, dope rhymes, dope cuts
I'll be the biggest dope dealer in history
Because all the fly will be high off that Ice-T

I'll bring it to boil, Evil E rock it up
You want in? I don't think you got enough
Last suckers crossed, Syndicate shot'em up
Cops found'em in the lake bottom up
I don't play when it comes to my dope
I check my lyrics close, like with a microscope
I don't clean'em up with no Ivory soap
I leave'em hard and pure, hope that you can cope
'Cause you might O.D. if you overdrive
This record, tape or CD, because the sound I've
Created on this wax is like a chemical
And the knowledge I give, makes me invincible

The cops don't know what to do because my dope breaks through
No matter what they do, my stuff gets to you
Kickin' on the Boulevard, my tempo's hyped and hard
I don't ask, the ICE just bogards
Sire Records puts me out, with Warner Bros. clout
My dope hits the streets with no doubt
Evil E adds the cut then removes it
IZ checks for purity, then approves it
And then you get it, try it and like it
And if it ain't potent, we remix it and spike it
To bring you the pure dope, not a noose in a rope
Because if you're doin' crack, you're on death row
You're just a toy punk, to mess with that junk
You want some real dope come look in my trunk
The dope I'm sellin' is life, 100% legit
So get real fool and try some real hit",I'm Your Pusher
Ice-T,"Emcee's no time out, it's time to rhyme out
You've dug your own grave, now you must climb out
Dig out, crawl out, hide from the fallout
'Cause when I get mad I go all out
ICE cooler than the coldest cube, dude
And when I'm micin' boy, I'm known to get rude
Criminal background, it's time to get down
I use a silencer, don't like the loud sound
Of my mic blast, you better run fast
The last punk that popped junk passed
Spit on his grave, laughed, jumped in my stretch
Signed his bitch and autograph
Syndicate boy, I don't fool out
You're full grown, school's out
You try to diss? I think you better cool out
'Cause your butt is smoke, if we ever duel out
This jam is directed, to all of those who expected
For me to cold be rejected but now I'm highly respected 
And now their ears are infected
With dollar signs I've collected
Jealous punks, I said it!

Take it personal
(Personal)

Take it personal punk, I'm talkin' to you
And if they agree with you, then your crew too
I never diss an emcee, I wish'em all good luck
But if you diss me to my face, duck
My style don't ramble, you shouldn't gamble
With your grill, I got a fist like an anvil
I write a record, lock it on the topic
EVIL and IZ dog the track, then we drop it
Record stores rock it, stock it, fans buy it
People that never heard of ICE-T try it
Then you try to diss? You got gall
I got gold on my neck and gold on my wall
Gold on my fingers, gold in my ear
When this jam's spinnin', gold's what you hear
Toy, this ain't Christimas, no time to play
I ain't no child, punk, you'll get sprayed
Illin' on a mega-villan
You must want a pine box to go chill in
Buried deep, creep, no one will weep
'Cause the next night with your bitch I'll sleep

Take it personal
(Personal)

I ain't East Coast, West Coast, new style, or old style
You wanna know about me? Check police files
Get out my face or you might have a bruised one
Brass knuckle prints? Yes, I used some
I ain't here to boast, I don't do that
When I talk it's straight dope, pure facts
I rock hard but still called a new jack
But talk shit, you're sure to get heard cracked
I don't drink or smoke or do dumb drugs
But my posse's still labeled street thugs
L.A.P.D's got all my boy's mugs
Can't use my phone for the damn bugs
I live in privacy, don't like suckers hawking me
News reporters, some think they can talk for me
Lies, misquotes, changin' all my words around
But if I catch 'em on the street they'll get beat down
They get money for hype-type publicity
They don't think twice, about dissin' me
But that's a mistake, with the SYNDICATE you shouldn't mess
I hope those punk reporters wear vests

Take it personal
(Personal)
Take that personal
(Personal)

Now the words I kick to some might sound radical
But I'll explain, it's simply mathematical
You diss, I diss, this creates an equal
You reply to my diss, this is called a sequel
I reply to your diss, this is called a battle
Not intelligent, not very adult
So I don't battle, I just put heads out
A straight line is always the direct route
I write lyrics clear, to leave no doubt
Don't even have to say who I'm speakin' about
You know who you are, you just jealous
'Cause you hear my records, are million sellers
Try to say I'm wack, out on the streets
While your whole crew is jockin' my beats
See me on T.V. and in the papers
See me at a jam, catch vapors

Ice-T,"I'm livin' large as possible, posse unstoppable
Style topical, it's vividly optical
Listen, you'll see 'em sometimes I'll be 'em
Cops, critics and punks, never ever want to see me in power
Well, that's too bad, Apocalypse now I'm back and I'm mad
We're comin', you're runnin' cold and cunning
Ice T on the mic, TopGunning
After your neck, checkin' respect, makin' you sweat
Rhyme Syndicate boy, in effect
The rap motivator, teacher, talker, night rhyme stalker
Words thrillin', so real they're chillin', the hit author
Gettin' louder than a shot gun, you don't want none
Rhyme pays was the name of the album
But that was number one, this is the number two
The posse grew,we're gonna break through

Power

Somebody line up the suckers who refuse to recognize the truth
Tie up the punks who refuse to understand the youth
My posse's growin' and it's gettin' larger every day
Detroit, Chi-Town, Pittsburgh, Houston, L.A.
Come on, come on, come on, toys, let's play
Circle the calendar, perpetrator doomsday
Ice-T fool, man of my own, full grown
I cause havoc when I speak upon the microphone
I'm outspoken, no jokin', get in my face your jaw will get broken
Layin' it, sayin' it, then you're playing it
Lyrics so heavy that you might try weighin' it
Hated by many but I hate 'em back
Loved by troopers who know where it's at
You might like me, might think I'm wack
But don't step to me 'cause the boy stays strapped
I'm taking no shorts, hatin' the courts, hatin' the judges
Punk DA's with their personal grudges
I hate the clubs that think with their butts
No hats, no jeans, no sneakers, no what?
No beepers, no gold? Yo kiss my ass
We'll wait and see who gets the last laugh
We'll have the power

Power
We'll have the power
Power

Power, it starts with P like pussy
She knows she's got it,she doesn't worry,does she?
Spendin' your cash, leavin' you in the trash
While your little head's thinkin', they're gone in a dash
They got it, know it, that's why they show it
The power of sex, if man could overthrow it
He'd be king in a day, no way. We get rich, hard, give it away
We're weak and as we speak, the girls are hawkin'
Sizin' me up straight out as I'm talkin'
But you gotta have control if you want the gold
I don't want to be alone like Stallone
So I keep my mind thinkin' 'bout the green
And stop dwellin' on the in-between
I got power

Power

I'm on a mission mackin' hard as a hammer
Take my picture, I might take your camera
My posse might move, and they move fast
A fool's move could be a punk's last
Ain't no criminal although I used to be
Ain't no new jack rappin' ain't new to me
I been makin' records on wax since 1982
Now it's 1988 finally I'm coming through
That adds up to six years of makin' ok jams, but now I'm mad
Here comes the body slam
Turnin' out concerts, house'n the industry
Lovin' all the fly girls screamin' for Ice-T
Rollin' with the Syndicate my unstoppable battalion
38 Solid gold my medalion
Gainin' velocity, momentum and energy
ICE Capital T
I got the power

Power

So you say that I'm a fake think, you really must be a fool
I been to jail more times than you have probably been in school
Shot at, shot back, hit, and seen my buddies killed
That's the foundation upon the raps of Ice-T are built
I say what I think, the system does stink
Money you walk, you short, you're writin' from the klink
Come on, what's up, you know the laws are full of bull
Prey on the lame, release those with pull
Power! I know you wanta try it
Well check out money can buy it
Control and mold the world to do your wishin'
The knowledge of power is mine, so just listen
Money controls the world and that's it
And once you got it, then you can talk shit

You'll have the power

Ice-T,"People, it's time for the Ice crush
So listen to my words I bring much
Sense, as I commence, my lyrics intense
Your telephoto, break out your big lens
Look, check out the sales charts
My record's kickin', I'm breakin' P.D.'s hearts
They banned me from their shows
'Cause they said I'm too hard
But no sell-out, I guess I'm just barred
I ain't changin' mine for no body
They bleeped words from Doug's LA-DE-DA-DE
I can't get a bleep? What's the deal?
Maybe my words are just too real
It's not profanity, it's just the man and me
He doesn't want you to see what I see
Doesn't want you to be what you can be
Word, censorship of reality

Radio suckers never play me
Radio suckers never play me
Radio suckers never play me

Suckers don't, but some do
The real troopers bring the ICE to you
And close friends to me, yeah, Public Enemy
These stations have high intellect
They don't pretend to be, too bourgeois to rock a jam raw
Understand what I'm sayin', they're down by law
They play the jams that are right, sometimes not polite
They realize you gotta get some people uptight
Speak the word, your voice will definitely be heard
Lie to yourself, you're destined to be to the curb
Some stations don't care, they'll never put on the air
Nothin' but commercial junk, their brain power's impaired
They don't listen or try to hear what I write
Maybe just think once, or try some school at night
They're makin' radio wack, people have to escape
But even if I'm banned, I'll sell a million tapes

Radio suckers never play me
Radio suckers never play me
Radio suckers never play me

I make records for music, not for the money
To some of you that might sound funny
But I ain't broke, and I don't joke
And my lyrics are known to make ears smoke
Clear as a gun scope, I speak the pure dope
Can the radio handle the truth? Nope
Uncut, no edits, no censors
You can get a plastic rapper from any old dispenser
A penny a yard, to make a record ain't hard
But to make it mean something, that's a job
But then we do it, they refuse it
So I tell them duck suckers to cold go screw it
We shouldn't sell out, we should just yell out
And get them wack motherfuckers the hell out

You know the guys will stop wildin' if you stop that crap
But you can't, you want money so bad
You'll jock anything with a Gucci tag
You gotta have it, so the men go get it
Robbin' and stealin', soon to regret it
Livin' in a jail cell, feelin' like a dumbbell
While you jump the next jock, well
That's reality, that's  what I see

Ice-T,"It was a Saturday night on the streets of Cali
Threw on my dope silk suit, brushed off my suede Bally's
Threw on enough gold for any girl's pleasure
Left a pound and a half of that shit still in the dresser
I slapped a clip in my nine, threw a clip in my sock
Picked three grand up off the dresser, it was ten on the dot
Now my beeper started beeping, I threw that shit in the sink
I didn't need it no more, I had more money than Brinks
See, I was quitting the game and tonight was my fling
You see on the streets they're players but only one king
Now that's the title I held but the game is real fast
You gotta get in and get out if you expecting to last
Now my homeboy Evil was downstairs chillin' in his brand new Benz
I had many adversaries but very few close friends
We broke to the set, E parked the car on the grass
High-signin' was his trademark and he did it with class
Hit the door like two titans, the whole jam stopped to stare
And as we walked through the crowd they threw bills in the air
I spied my man Jazz maxin' out with two stone cold freaks
""Yo, what's up Ice, you rich now, man, you too good to speak?""
Now Jazz was a player from the east coast, the Bronx
He was known to be hard on the women and a brother he'd stomp
Smack a bitch in a minute, some say just for fun
And he was known for his chrome-plated pearl-handled gun
""Yo Ice, you my brother and I love you and all
But what's up with that six g's you owe me, man
'Member when your boys took that fall?
And I posted the bail 'cause yo ass was locked up""
Evil gave Jazz ten g's and Jazz shut the fuck up
Just then I saw Donald-D hit the front door
More gold than a Aztec, black leather he wore
Hoes grabbed for they niggas when D hit the set
'Cause what Donald D wanted, is what Donald D get
Donald's eyes hit mine, then a smile across his face
Then a light hit his ring and blinded the whole goddamn place
""Yo Ice you the coolest and Evil you mean
But I got the flyest shit rollin' off gasoline""
Everyone in the party moved quickly outside
To see Donald D's ultimate super fly ride
It was black, it was low, cost twice that of my Porsche
A Testarossa Ferrari, convertible of course
It purred like a jet
""Yo man, I bought it with cash""
It had 'Donald D' written in gold on the dash
Then out of no where came a shot across the street
I felt pain in my chest and my knees got weak
There was blood on my hands and I fell to to the ground
And all I could hear was ""Yo Ice is down!""
Somebody had shot me

The night that I ended all this hustlin', playin' shit

The FCC says ""Profanity - No Airplay""?
They can suck my dick while I take a shit all day
Think I give a fuck about some silly bitch named Gore?
Yo PMRC, here we go, raw
Yo Tip, what's the matter? You ain't gettin' no dick?
You're bitchin' about rock'n'roll, that's censorship, dumb bitch
The Constitution says we all got a right to speak
Say what we want Tip, your argument is weak
Censor records, TV, school books too
And who decides what's right to hear? You?
Hey PMRC, you stupid fuckin' assholes
The sticker on the record is what makes 'em sell gold
Can't you see, you alcoholic idiots
The more you try to suppress us, the larger we get
   
[You have the right to remain silent]
Fuck that right! I want the right to talk
I want the right to speak, I want the right to walk
Where I wanna, yell and I'm gonna
Tell and rebel every time I'm on a
Microphone on the stage cold illin'
The knowledge I drop will be heard by millions
We ain't the problems, we ain't the villains
It's the suckers deprivin' the truth from our children
You can't hide the fact, Jack
There's violence in the streets every day, any fool can recognise that
But you try to lie and lie
And say America's some motherfuckin' apple pie
Yo, you gotta be high to believe that
You're gonna change the world by a sticker on a record sleeve
Cos once you take away my right to speak
Everybody in the world's up shit creek
   
Let me tell you about down south
Where a motherfucker might as well not even have a mouth
Columbus, Georgia, said they'd lock me up
If I got on the stage in my show and said ""Fuck""
So I thought for a minute and said ""No,
I wasn't even gonna do a damned show""
Cos for me to change my words from my rhymes
Is never gonna happen cos there's no sell outs on mine
But I vowed to get those motherfuckers one day
They even arrested Bobby Brown and Cool J
Yo, they got their's comin', cos I'm mad and I'm gunnin'
Homeboys, and there's no runnin'
I'm gonna tell you how I feel about you
No bull, no lies, no slack, just straight fact
Columbus, Georgia, you can suck my dick
You ain't nothin' but a piece of fuckin' shit on the damned map
   
Freedom of Speech, let 'em take it from me
Next they'll take it from you, then what you gonna do?
Let 'em censor books, let 'em censor art
PMRC, this is where the witch hunt starts
You'll censor what we see, we read, we hear, we learn
The books will burn
You better think it out
We should be able to say anything, our lungs were meant to shout
Say what we feel, yell out what's real
Even though it may not bring mass appeal
Your opinion is yours, my opinion is mine
If you don't like what I'm sayin'? Fine
But don't close it, always keep an open mind
A man who fails to listen is blind
We only got one right left in the world today
Let me have it or throw The Constitution away
   
What they're trying to do with radio, with this, uh, McCarron-Walter
Act and a lot of other ways, is start by saying that they're
protecting the public from wicked rock bands, or girlie magazines, or
whatever. But, if you follow the chain of dominoes that falls down,
what they're really trying to do is shut off our access to information
itself.
   
If they can't do it by law they know there's other ways to do it.

Ice-T,"Yo! I met this girl the other night
Hype super-dope body and face, her mini-skirt tight
Talkin' 'bout legs and lips, mindblowin' hips
Had to cross my legs just to look at her tits
Said she came out lookin' for some fun
Looked me in my eyes and told me...I was the one
I said ""Why?"", she said I was fly
Grabbed me by my hand and I thought I would die
Said she wanted to take me home to make love
Now that's the kind of rap that brothers dream of
I said, ""Fast, slow, hard or soft, baby?""
She said, ""All the above""

This girl tried to kill me, she didn't use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me, took me within a inch of my life

Now, I ain't no sucker on the weak tip
But let me tell you, she was on some motherfuckin' sex trip
Took me to her crib that night, leather and spikes
Broke out the rope and the dope strobe-light
And started buggin', lightin' candles all over the room
Then she did a backflip, landed on my dick
I knew that I would be dead soon

This girl tried to kill me, she didn't use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me, took me within a inch of my life
This girl tried to kill me, she didn't use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me, homeboys, watch out for this one

Yo, my pants were on, but so what?
She ripped off my shirt and tied my monkey-ass up
Faster than I could say ""No!""
It was like a rodeo, I was with a sex nut
I looked in her face...
She sweated and she grinned with delight
And then she broke out a whip, I said ""Shit!""
This girl had crazy plans for the night
 
This girl tried to kill me, she didn't use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me, homeboys, watch out for this one
This girl tried to kill me, she didn't use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me, took me within a inch of my life

Now whips ain't all that she had
All kinda crazy shit was at this bitch's pad
I'm talkin' about latex suits, spike-heeled boots
Oversized vibrators so that she could get loose
I said, ""Don't...don't...don't whip me!
I'll do anything you ask!""
And then homegirl stripped, 38"" tits
Man you shoulda seen that ass

This girl tried to kill me, she didn't use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me, took me within a inch of my life
This freak tried to kill me, she didn't use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me, homeboys, watch out for this one

My dick was harder than a bulletproof vest
She started pourin' baby oil on her chest
And then she said, ""Gimme gimme gimme""
Jumped on my Jimmy, and rode me like the Wild West
I almost passed out, then the front door cold bust in
It was her fuckin' husband, six-foot ten
I knew my life would soon end

Homeboy tried to kill me, he didn't use a bomb or a gun
Homeboy tried to kill me, yo...yo, nowhere to run
Homeboy tried to kill me, he didn't use a gun or a knife
Homeboy tried to kill me, cos he had caught me fuckin' his wife

And still keep you on the floor like a maniac
That's your question? Well I'ma answer that

You wanna know what's happenin - ""WHAT?""

Look in my face as my eyeballs roll
Back in my head and the mic glows red
Step in my face and you'll wind up dead

Eight years of mine, no time for draggin
You wanna be an MC?  ""Get off the bandwagon!""
But if it's in your heart, get a pen
Don't stop writin til the inkflow ends
Work and work and don't halfstep
Dog the mic every chance you get
Motivation must be kept
Stay down and build your rep
Yo so let me demonstrate, rappin as a fine art
And when I'm finished, you can take this rap apart
Analyze my elements and tactics
First I'm over there, and then I'm back to this
I jumble topics, you won't know where I'll go
Back in your face with a cold but steady flow
You feel the power of the Ice in the first row
You already know what to say, ""HOOOOOOOOO!!!""
On the mic is a stone cold vet
Evil E's on the set, hit the deck

I'm in my mode, called the fourth episode
Or the last verse, if you wanna decode
So I gotta raise the heat, hype up the beat
Switch the mic from airtight to elite
Pounce upon the deck, it ain't wet yet
Let me see how hot you can get
Then I'll turn up the amps, blow out the lights
You're in darkness, then the mic ignites
Glowin like it did before, but even more
The room is lit, the raps are hardcore
Evil cuts the records like a psycho with a switchblade
You see a blur -- that's the crossfade
Loud and proud, words bombard the crowd
Look up in the air -- you see a mushroom cloud
I kick flavor to a musical track
Too fast to catch, too complex to match
I'm gettin hyped as hype can get

No jokin' I'm sleepin' with my eyes open 
Wanted for a homicide ride the gun's still smokin' 
Didn't know what I was doin' but did it anyway 
Now the posse's on my trail they say I'm gonna pay (Run!) 

I had a gun it's mine and I packed it 
Out with my crew the boys caught some static 
Me and this sucker punk went at it 
Bang! Nine automatic 

Hunted Child 
I'm the Hunted Child 

(Sources say the assailant was 17-years old and lives in South-Central

Now I'm on a hideout tip 'cause they're after me 
LAPD says they're gonna capture me 
Was I crazy? I guess I had to be 
'Cause once you kill it's instant catastrophe 

Your whole life is over (Through!) 
Forget about your girl your (Crew!) 
Nowhere to run, so what you gonna do? 
Be glad it's me, homeboy, and not you

I'm only 17, I didn't mean to kill, man 
But I was slangin' and bangin' for the thrill, man 
When they said (Kill!) I felt chill, man 
But once I pulled the trigger, boy, then things got ill, man 

My homeboys dipped out the back fast 
Left me alone in the echo of the gun blast 
Everybody saw my face, I didn't wear a mask

Since I was young I never had a damned thing 
At Christmas time I'd hate to hear the bells ring 

'Cause in the ghetto Santa ain't got a dime 
Your mother's standin' in the welfare line 
The way the youth survive is crime 
My life is over so I might as well speak my mind 

I killed a brother 'cause this system had me geared to kill 
'Cause what I call home you call hell 
My ghetto quarters ain't no better than a jail cell 
But there's a message in this story that I'm tryna tell

Face of Death, then I cocked my pump
I'm a nigga on the trigger, madder than a pitbull
Just layin for a reason to pull
on you, any duck motherfucker that gets in my way
I'm insane, and my homeboy's death made me this way
But then we spot him, Evil E shot him
Dead in the face, made sure that he got him
Others ran, but no mercy to the posse's wrath

Let's peel their caps back
Let's peel their caps back
Let's peel their caps back

Then all of a sudden, a bullet came through my eye
My dome exploded and I felt my other brothers die
I drink my blood as I fell like shit into the street
My corpse stunk like a burnt out rotten piece of meat
Ten brothers died in this stupid homicidal binge
Cause whenever someone dies, nobody wins
But this drama, you'll never hear a word of

Dig it, I'm just a brother from L.A.
South Central, I live life the fly way
Used to bang and hustle but I traded for the big game
Infamy got dumped for fame
Now I'm known and respect as creator of the crime rhyme;
but my lyrics are deeper
Because I'm the one that makes you think before make a move
I wrote ""Pusher"", ""High Rollers"", and ""Colors"" just to prove
that I could kick game, and drop knowledge at the same time
But one L.A. station wouldn't play my records one time
I'm tryin to save my community
but these bourgeoise blacks keep on doggin me
They don't care about violence, drugs and gangs
KJLH, you ain't about nuttin
You just a bunch of punk bourgeoise black suckers
and this one's for me

You won't play no Public Enemy
You ain't playin no Boogie Down Productions
You ain't tryin to represent the black community
You just carin about your little ol' R&B +BULL+
you play all day and night
I represent Los Angeles all over the United States
and you ain't did NUTTIN for me
Think about it

Hold up, I ain't finished on the diss tip
There's a few more punks that I got to rip
All you chump MC's who sell out quick
When P.E. was on the top, you rode the tip
But now they got problems and you suckers run
Who's Chuck's real friends, does he really have one?
You yell P.E. this, P.E. that
Fist in the air, proud to be black
Now they got static and you run like punks
I haven't heard an MC stand up for him once
Maybe you suckers are just hopin that they fall off
so you can fill their shoes, nope sorry boss
That's what the matter with black people anyway
We ain't down with nothin, I don't care what you say
yell or lie, don't even bother
How low will a brother go for a dollar?
Public Enemy broke a new rap age
And now you rappers ain't got nuttin to say?
""Yo it's their problem""		""Griff shouldn'ta said it""
E where's my pistol?  (Yo I'll go get it)
Cause it's time for me to enforce some discipline
Are you down or not, are you out or in?
Chuck Flav and Griff are my true friends
I got their backs if it means my career ends

All you so-called down MC's with Public Enemy
I ain't heard nobody out there, tryin to help my man out
YouknowhatI'msayin?  Griff is my man, I don't care WHAT he said
YouknowhatI'msayin?  And I ain't gon' let them go out like that
YouknowhatI'msayin?  Chuck, Ice got your back
Anybody out there got problems with Public Enemy, come talk to me

Once again, I'm back in the diss mode
I gotta speak my mind, it's time to unload
on this so-called government we've got
If I lied like them, I think I'd get shot
They sell drugs to kids and say it's us
And when the cops are crooks, who can you trust?
You only see young brothers in a drug bust
Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust
My homey got a year for an ounce of weed
while Bush sells weapons to the enemy
You gotta be stone blind not to see
""Our government is honest!""  Nigga, please
Cocaine can't be made in the United States
Kickin facts like this our government hates
The young kids on the streets ain't the enemy
They're just ghetto youth after money
They sell drugs, but who sells drugs to them?
Try the C.I.A. my friend
or the F.B.I. or even Bush
Somebody's gettin rich, damn sure ain't us
We're just killin ourselves while others laugh
Look at the street, it's a cocaine bloodbath
We gotta realize dope is pure death
Mess with drugs, you're breathin your last breath
Sellin drugs is straight up genocide
They're gonna laugh, while we all die

Sittin up there thinkin you're makin that money
Hustlin and all that, you're killin your brothers
YouknowhatI'msayin?  You just stupid, straight up stupid
Puttin dope into your body - c'mon, youknowhatI'msayin?
You gotta get somethin goin out there
Get some brains, youknowhatI'msayin?
We are just playin ourselves cold out of the pocket

This one's for me, I make records for you
but this cut I straight out had to do
There's topics in my mind I have to break
cause so many of you out there are so damn fake
If ya ain't know they're no-one, cutthroats
backstabbers, scheamin for banknotes
And all of you out there know what I'm talkin bout
If you claim you're down then NEVER sell-out
Never sell out, youknowhatI'msayin?
You gotta stay down for yours
You know I want it, sure as I'm Ice-T
I make records for you, but this one's for me

You know what I'm talkin bout out there
There's ways to sell out left and right
But you ain't got to do that
There's things more important than money
I'm talkin bout pride, I'm talkin bout dignity
You got it out there
All you got to do is stand on your own two feet
Don't go out like no sucker
Stay down, youknowhatI'msayin?
Peace",This One's for Me
Ice-T,"Party!
(Okay party people in the house) 

Yo yo, in the place to be
My name is MC Ice-T
I got the Rhyme Syndicate with me
We about to tear stuff up, y'all feel good?
Yo, what the hell y'all wanna do, Syndicate, tonight, what you wanna do? 
(Party!)
Randy Mac in the place to be, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Nat The Cat, you're in the house tonight, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Donald-D is in the place to be, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Bronx Style Bob is in the house, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Hen-Gee is in the house, what you wanna do, homeboy? (Party!) 
My man Shaquel is in the place to be, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Yo, Toddy Tee is in the house tonight, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Yo, Everlast is in the house, come on, what you wanna do? (Party!)
And MC Taste is in the place to be, what you wanna do? (Party!)
My man Divine is in the house, what you wanna do, homeboy? (Party!)
Yo yo, I'm about to kick this party up, is that alright?

Yo, Yo, MC Ice on a Syndicate Rhyme spree
You say you wanna be down, you gotta talk to me
You wanna get in? Put a sucker's head out
Sound a little hot for you, boy? Then, toy, get out
Syndicate mob ain't nothin but hardened crooks
You try to diss, your butt is on a meat hook
Want some of me? You're on a mission
Bad move, you end up missin

Let's get it straight for the '89 tip
Randy Mac is clockin a stupid grip
On the party track I'm cold lampin
But when the Syndicate rolls I be jackin
You thought I fell off, I ain't even slipped
The Mac is cuttin records and punks are gettin ripped
Gangster I am, bust the lyrics like a drive-by
You wanna sleep? Well, it's lights out, beddy-bye

Notorious Asiatic, tough, talented
A power entertainer
Catapultin above the top
Nat The Cat, too swift to be stopped
I'm like Jordan, a team player on a solo flight
Lookin down on MC's faces full of fright and fear
I slam dunk a rap through their ear to hear
Heureka! I just struck a platinum fame
In the game things'll never be the same
Because money changes everything

Once again comin at you hyper
Donald D the Syndicate Sniper
Boston Strangler, Charles Manson
No matter what killer I mention, keep dancin
Five Fingers Of Death, Fists Of Fury
St. Valentine's Day Massacre on a jury
Wanna convict me for kickin black on wax
I walk the street with a battle axe

Life ain't nothin but a piece of existence
Cause when you die, you'se a past tense
So I like to live my life like a big carnival
Get drunk, act like an animal
I like the rock'n rolll, the funk, the jazz and hip-hop
Suckers get loud, I drop em
I like 
I'm Bronx Bob, bring the beats and I'm

Black stallion, knockin on concrete walls
Standin tall, rappers in my face, they stall
Stutter, softer than melted butter
There's no other word, go ask your mother
Hard solid as your city 
Born in Brooklyn, can tell by the way that I walk and talk
Strollin with a slight limp
Flyer than any big city pimp

Gold, girls, cold cash
On the mic Shaquel Shabazz
Supreme, the Lord, the G-o-d
Down with the Syndicate posse
It's you we rule without a tool
Mathematics in effect, it's time to school
I'm the principal and knowledge is the key
Shaquel in the place to be

I climb a mountain top with just one rope
Get to the top of the stairs and say a rhyme that's dope
Cause I'm a cliffhanger, no, I ain't a stranger
Yo, I'm Toddy Tee, and I'm a Compton banger
Wanted by the F.B.I. for transport of
Sucker MC's across the Syndicate borders
No, they can't give me no time, cause it's my rhyme
Everlast, get funky for me one time

Everlast is in effect gettin big respect
Then I collect big checks
1's, 5's, 10's and 20's
A 100 g's and I'm pullin honeys
Left and right, day and night
You gotta see it to believe it, it's quite a sight
They're all on the tip to get a sip
Of this poetic performer that's fully equipped

Y'all played yourselves right in front of the mic
Moved your body so that the feelin was right
But if you get lost scream out and admit
That the beat's too fast, slow it down or I quit
I'm not the kind to give you a call
To stop on a rap that I lead, so I pause
I give you 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
If that ain't enough, sit down till we're done

Syndicate scorned, you act obedient
Tired of your fish rhyme ingredients
Black on black while styles 
of brothers that's gotta be
Circlin cyphers into molecules
Takin over your space, that's illogical
The vocal chords on a board with 24 tracks
Get away from the break gotta rap

Syndicate posse growin, goin out of control
You say we're weak? This record's shippin gold
Power, strength, my posse got unity
We stick together and we're soon to be
In your town, we gonna bring the roof down
Ice-T and the syndicate underground
No selll-outs, cause it's caps we peelin
Girls we love em, and shows we steal em

Knowledge and wisdom, it's a mystery
I drop science for the ones who know it's me
You say I'm dope, cool, it makes sense
I ain't conceited, I'm just convinced
Strapped for the attack Randy Mac is rollin
The mic, the mixer, then the show is stolen
The pimp, the player, hustler kicker
Watch your girl, cause I stick her

Nat The Cat, my man will rap when I'm playin the back
Some think my stage presence is low, I think it's loud
Enough to see me flowin and showin
Go psycho breakin backs like bolo
Give me the mic, a metamorphis ignite
I break down on a cat stand, I kill ya like a hitman
And come out kickin with the 
Rockin on a rappin rampage
In control of the stage

There's a mouse in my house, so I bought a cat
The cat ran away, cause now there's a rat
I'm on the attack with my baseball bat
That one rap brought many of us back
All through my house I set up traps
It seem like the rats have a map
But nowadays I don't know how to act
So now I feed the rats crack

Back and I'm statin the fact
I know you're waitin for a rap
To make you get up and start to clap
For Bob, a Bronx Syndicate style
More bounce to the ounce and trizzy to the file
'79 the time I was inclined
To get smooth and prove that I can rock a funk rhyme
Hey yo, ice-cube chillin
Cause we got the gats and knack to see the kids top billin

Impressionalist, not a ventriloquist
Don't hang out with suckers worth less than piss
Suckers can all come kiss the tip
Of my knob when I aim I don't miss
Aim it to suckers that come around jockin
On my tip when on the radio my recors be rockin
Don't come frontin askin me for a pound
You ain't invited means you simply ain't down

Wake up it's time to be noticed
I'ma do this, I'm gonna show this
Beat to be mathematical
Syndicate's in the house, let's get radical
Bum rush the show and grab the mic
Syndicate's chilllin out tonight
They let me loose and now it's war
 let the rhymes roar

Grab a partner and hit the dancefloor
Cause I'm back to rock for you once more
I don't worry about what he said or she said
As long as what's said-said is done-done in my bed
The Juvenile Committee's on my side
And I'm kickin knowledge on a natural high
And I'm feeling strong
Yo, take this mic and get the party on

This is mortal combat, there ain't no comeback
You're tryin to get with me but you don't know where I'm at
Cause in this world there's no bombs or guns
Just a microphone, metaphors, words and puns
Sentences and phrases, no clubs or razors
No mercy for a sucker that wages
War, I'll take the floor, even the score
Grab the microphone and proceed to roar

Are y'all set, all prepared to start
Move in close cause here comes the dope part
By the way, I'm the Taste, if tracks
Could talk but they - but here go the facts
Brace yourself, you shoulda grabbed a grip
Protect your clan cause we're about to trip
Bass reflex, the kicks that drive, divide
The weak from the rest can't survive

Syndicate's housin all competition
We paralyze a physical powerful vision
But savage ignorants pop that's ignorant listen
Divine is no time for style
And I rock your grey matter with a smile
Cause I'm the rhyme thriller with dimensions of flavor
The knack - stylistic black

The reason we're bustin these raps are what?
To make all you wack MC's shut up
You're always buyin rap records jammin def beats
Then dissin rap artists out in the streets
You always say our jams are wack but yours'll be tight
But you never been near a studio in your life
You see, disrespect is your last resort
You're like Howard [Name], you never played this sport
But you're always talkin mess bout how it should be done
And when we ask to hear your record you never made one
So this message goes to amateurs and pros alike
We're the MC's that cold be doggin the mic
You may be good but there's no one better
We rock you so cold, you need a cashmere sweater
Fight dirty in the pit when combat is on
We always attack before attacked upon

Yeah, Rhyme Syndicate, we in here
We tossin it up
I got my man Everlast in the house
Tossin it up, youknowwhatimsayin
Kid Jazz and Bango couldn't be here
But we gon' to' it up for them anyhow
Wherever you are you're a star
Rhyme Syndicate blowin up like napalm
I got my man Chilly Dee deejayin on the set
And the one and only DJ Evil-E, we in here
Yo, we outta here like last year
Rhyme Syndicate
We gotta do it like the alphabet and a-b-c ya
Yeah

Everlast
Everlast in full effect
Where's my gold record?
Where's my record?
Where's my record?

Divine Styler with Physical Poets, look out

Microphone King Donald D the notorious, yeah

This is Bronx Style Bob...

Nat The Cat, boy

Randy Mac
One in a million on your back, boy

Yo
So we bout to get outta here
Seems like the police is outside, man
(Yo Ice, man, they got King Tee, Aladdin and Islam)
What, the police, man?
I knew somethin had happened
I was wonderin why King Tee missed the party, man
Yo Randy Mac, you got some money?
(Aw, you know what time it is, man
I got...)
Yeah, for some bail, buddy
We got to go do some work, man...
",What Ya Wanna Do?
Ice-T,"I once knew this brother
Who I thought was cool with me
Chilled out together
Even went to school with me
Fly nigga, my ace boon coon
Used to low ride together
Shot dice in the bathroom
Ya want trouble?
Well trouble ya found
Cause we diss ya, then issue
The critical beat down
He needed money
I would always come through
Needed a car? He could use mine too
But bust this!
Out on the street
People say he was riffin'
Callin' me a sucker
Talkin' bout how foul I'm livin'
Someone heard him
Poppin' that shit last week
Frontin' for some pussy
>From some big butt freak
Sayin' I'm his worker
I was on his dick!
Talkin' that craazy old weak assed shit
and after all of that
She still walked away
How ya gonna diss your boy
To get some play?
And when I stepped to him about it
He said, ""Who snitched?""

CHORUS
Yo, how did he go out?
He went out like a bitch!
So ladies
We ain't just talkin' bout you
Cause some of you niggas
Is bitches too!

I knew this brother named Mitch
Stone player
He meet a girl, in five min. he lay her
Trucked crazy jewels
Hands smothered in ice
Been to prison not once, but twice
Kept a stupid thick posse
Made of thugs and
Crooks and hoods
and vet hustlers
Who were up to no good
But they all stood behind him
and watched his back
That's the only way
To roll on  the track
But yo,
Mitch got rushed by feds last week
The snatchbared the runk
Of his white Corniche
Took a look inside
And what did they see?
Two keys, and a gallon of PCP!
Oh shit! The thought crashed
Mitch's subliminal
Three strikes, that's called
Habitual criminal
So insted of goin' under
He snitched on his whole posse
Maxed at the crib
And sipped Martini and Rossi
Sold out his whole crew
That rat named Mitch

CHORUS

I knew this guy
That was never that fly
Couldn't act cool
Even when he tried
When we played rough
He always cried
When he told stories, he always lied
A Black brother
Who was missin' the cool part
He had the color
But was missin' the true heart
When we would fight
He would always go down quick
So he took karate
and he still got his ass kicked
But now he's married
And he kicks his wife's ass
Says it comes from problems
That he had in the past
Doesn't like Blacks
Claims he's upper class
Joined the police, got himself a badge
Now he rolls the streets
and he's cut to jack
Doggin' young brothers
Cause they usually don't fight back
Got a White partner
And he asked for that
and every night
Another head they crack
So now he's big man
But he really ain't shit!

CHORUS

Out one night with my crew
and some new kid
I didn'T know homeboy, but Evil E did
So I thought he was cool
We rode in his ride
Rag top tray on Daytons
Lifted side to side
We hit the party deep
Niggas was hawkin' me
You could feel the vibe
Of thick artillery
Parliament was on, some O.G. shit
I put my back to the wall
And felt my pistol grip
al of a sudden
Niggas started trippin'
Flippin', the record started skippin'
Wildin', fools started locn up
Gats cracked
The room started smokin' up
Me and ""E"" hit the floor
And then the back door
My boys let off an automatic encore
But when we made it out to  the ride
It was gone, we had to shoot it out
Side by side
Punk left us there to die in a ditch!

CHORUS",Bitches 2
Ice-T,"God damn, what a brother gotta do
To get a message through
To the red, white and blue

What? I gotta die? Before you realize
I was a brother with open eyes

The world's insane
While you drink champagne
And I'm livin' in black rain

You try to ban the A.K.
I got ten of 'em stashed
With a case of hand grenades

(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!

You'd know what to do
If a bullet hit your kid
On the way to school
Or a cop shot your kid in the back yard
Shit would hit the fan and hit hard!

CHORUS
I hear it every night, another gun fight
The tension mounts
On with the body count!

God damn what a brother gotta do
To get a message through
To the red, white and you?

What? I gotta die? Before you realize
I was a nigga with open eyes

The world's insane
While you drink champagne
And I'm livin' in black rain

Don't you hear the guns?
You stupid, dumb, dick suckin'
Bum politicians

(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!

The tension mounts!",Body Count
Ice-T,"Let me tell ya a little story
Bout my homeboy Ed
Use to drink every day
Straight 40's to the head
You try to snap on him
He'd ask what you said
You still try to break
He'd start given up lead
Love to gamble
On one knee he stayed
Tryin' to hit seven
on one knee he stayed
Worked tees and weights
So he always got paid
Blew on the hoes
Every dollar he made
Crazy friends, crazy friends he had
Superfly drobe, super dope pad
Cars for your ass
and I'm talkin' class
Benz's and better
With his name on  the dash
One night he got drunk
And started drivin' real fast...

Ed's dead",Ed
Ice-T,"Here we go
I'm movin' off death row
Ya gotta keep up hops
Ya can't be slow
Cuse their towers are high
They got the hype gaats
Check the perimeters good
Read the maps
It's night
They might not see us
Cuse if they catch us out there
They'll bleed us
Shoot us, kill us
Dump us in a dark ditch
Clean it up, call it a gang hit
I gotta make my move
Cause I'm a renegade
I recognize
when mind techniques
Are being played
It's a plot they use
To keep down another
Here comes another
Brainwashed brother

Shut up do you know
How dumb you sound?
That mentality
What keeps my people down
No one wants to
Live in an urban war
You live there cause
Your parents were poor
They live there because
Theirs were also
Get yourself together
Hit the gates bro!

CHORUS
Ya gotta get out!
Ya gotta get out! Why?
Ya gotta get out!
Ya gotta get out! Why?
Ya gotta get out!
Ya gotta get out! Why?
Cause the fields
Are where you die!

Escape from
The killing fields
You try to keep us
Running and running faster
But I ain't runnin' from ya
I'm runnin' at ya
and my posse's thick
About a mil strong
Too late to make up now
Cause it's on
I'm the one that's got ya
In constant fear
I'm the nigga
You shoulda killed last yeaar
But you played yourself
You let me gain wealth
Now I can change the wy
The cards are dealt
I've schooled my homeboys
Made 'em all understand
The tricks nd twists
Inflicted on the Black man
How ya make me think
to be down
I gotta stay around
Down in the motherfuckin'
Battleground
There'll never be any good
Schools in the hood
There'll never be any cops
That are any good
The hospital is a great place
To go to die
Real estate's cheap
Let me tell ya why?
The man's got a
Sure fire system
A economic prison!

CHORUS

Escape from
The killing fields!",Escape from the Killing Fields
Ice-T,"Upon initial contact with Ice-T's music,
I had envisioned him to be an ill-
Mannered and psychologically
Unstable man with an extremely
Uneducated and barbaric
Frame of mind, whose raps displayed
Nothing but ridiculous jaargon,
Shocking sexual audacity and
Repulsive images of the ghetto.
However, after further analysis of
His music I can deduce
That he is the epitome of
Antidisestblishmentarianism who
Embodies the entire spectrum of the
Urban experience and struggle.
But to make things more plain and
Simple to the lymn, I find Ice-T to be
The dopest, flyist, O.G. pimp hustler
Gangster plyer hardcore
Motherfucker living today.

To be honest I'm totally and
Irrevocably on his dick",First Impression
Ice-T,"Everybody step back from the mic
As I set it off
All playin' the wall
It's time to sweat it off
Anybody with staatic oh please try
I'll do ya like Godfather 3
And do a fly by
Time to rip and hit and strangle
I eat Guardian Angels
And toy emcees
With their names on the front page
I bury in shallow graves
I don't rap to girls on my L.P.
I don't beg for pussy
I love the ladies
aand they love me right back
Now who's the mac?
Mission accomplished
I came to stomp this microphone
And leave suckers unconscious
and if you uthink
Yo got an S on your chest
You better wear two vests
Watch your back, your front
I always hit, don't bunt
Crazy posse
When I'm on a duck hunt
Emcee Ice-T answers to no one
Load my rhymes
And cock 'em like a shotgun
Let off like frags from a pipe bomb
A low stroll
and my mic in my right palm
The cops hate me
And that's right they oughta
Before my crew
Gets to their daughters

Nat the Cat Grandmaster Caz",Fly By
Ice-T,"Off to the studio late night
Time to cut another track
It's gotta be hype
Got my rhyme book in hand
A blue loose leaf
Anybody move on that
They get loose teeth
Evil's got the funky beat
A stupid dope loop
But the record's kind of old!
(What we gonna do troop?)
We gotta clean it up
Cause it's so dope
Tried the rubbing alcohol
Even the Ivory soap
But no matter what we do
The record keeps clickin'
FUCK IT!
Evil E, give me some of that
Damn fried chicken!",Fried Chicken
Ice-T,"You know the houe down the street
Where the kids are
and every day
They seem to have a new scar
Something strange is going on
And everybody knows
Doors always shut
Windows always closed
The little girl had a burn
The boy was black and blue
They said it came from play
You know that shit ain't true
The boy's arm's broke
Girl's scared to speak
Their parents drink all day
Couple of dead beats
Some days they go to school
And other days they might
It's hard to stay awake
After you cry all night
You see 'em every daay
Tear tracks on their cheeks
But they will never tell
It goes on weeks and weeks
(But what can they do?
They're only children man!)

You ain't no fuckin' kid
Act like you give a damn!
Won't someone save these kids
Do something, call a cop

The other night I heard gun shots!",The House
Ice-T,"It's eight a.m. I roll out my silk sheets
Get fly crash the limo back seats
Lookin' in the faces
Of some ladies that I never met
On the interview tip, no sweat
They ask me questions
I throw the words back
They say they write facts
I know that's bull crap
They're kickin' drama
But then drama's my middle name
That's the price ya pay for big fame
The cellular phone rings
Dot wanta pick it up
But it's my J-O-be	 I gotta kick it up
Another damn reporter
On the line with a word quiz
I gotta show cause I'm livin' with the show
Biz. Out the llimo, to the plane
In the pourin' rain
I hate flyin'
But there's no time for slow trains
another show to do
I gotta caatch my crew
They left last night
In the bus around two
The plane's a small one
No fun at all
Bouncin' round the air
Like a tennis ball
When it touches down
I want to kiss the ground
But it's time to wreck a new town
Get to the arena, meet up with the crew
They tell me all  the speakers blew
The cordless don't work
Sound man's a jerk
Somebody's gonna get hurt
I'm crazy mad
But my fans want autographs
I turn my angry frowns
Into fake laughs
I can't be rude
Cause they wouldn't understand
I in't human no more, I'm a superman

CHORUS
You can try
But you'll never understand this
You can try
But you'll never understand this
You can try
But you'll never understand this
The lifestyles of the rich a and infamous

Four hours till show time oh well
I might as well check in the hotel
Get a little rest
Before it's time to play
Ten brothers standin' in the hallway
All with demo tapes
They need the hook up
They heard that I was
The one to look up
I can't ditch 'em
Cause they already saw me
I'll put my head down
Maybe they'll ignore me
No chance ""Ice what's goin' on?""
I listened to twenty-five songs
And after thaat
The brothers still wouldn't leave
They started lookin' at my T.V.
I was gonna break down
If they didn't jet soon
Snuck across the hall
And crashed in E's room
But then this freak came in
Thought I was E
Straddled her legs across me
Ripped off her blouse
Pushed her breast against my face
Started girating her waist. Sounds fly,
Like a hype sex thriller?
But see she looked like Godzilla
Pushed her off me
Home girl hit the floor
This is what it's like on tour
I hit the hallway it was crawlin' thick
""Could we take this picture real quick?""
Jumped into a pose
That I used a million times before
Took pictures
With the whole damn floor
I couldn't say no not to my fans
You see they wouldn't understand

CHORUS

Now it's show time, time to flow time
Evil lost the records
But we still gotta go time
The house is packed
Everybody's on their feet
So I say, ""Throw on Rakim's beat.""
E hits the fader and the crowd is lit
I start bustin' off some new shit
The stage is so smokey
That I almost fall off, I start inhalin' it
I'm tryin' not to cough
I'm catchin' problems from every angle
The mic cords are tangled
I try to flow smooth
But my words are mangled
Damn near slipped and broke my ankle
If that ain't enough
The police are hawkin'
Listenin' real close
To the words I'm talkin'
They want to put a brother like me
In the back seat
Just because I curse the beat
They want to tap my phone
want to keep my crib bugged
Call all my homes
Felonist street thugs
You might say
I think this lifestyle sucks?
I wouldn't tade it for a million bucks
Although it's all
Not glamour and gleam
It's still my dream

CHORUS",Lifestyles of the Rich and Infamous
Ice-T,"Brainstorm microphone napalm
This is it, words from a timebomb
Attack speed, fast as an F15
Raise the heat, light thhe gasoline
Overload, it might cause a blackout
Dead end
There's no chnce to back out
Hit the tripwire
Duck from the gunfire
Broken glass, screech'n car tires, bodies hit the deck
As I commence to wreck
Eject another clip and drip sweat
Face of danger, increasin' nger
Point blank
I smoke another stranger
Grip the mic tight
I see the brake lights
Hit the back door
I lay down cross the floor
E's on the wheels
He makes the rubber squel
Blood's on my gear
From caps I've peeled
About a block away I sit up
Look back
It wasn't nothin' but a
Microphone contract!
Dressed in black I stalk my prey
Parabellum in a leather attache
Low tones I speak, I speak to few
Just give me the money
and who the fuck to do
Four blocks away my aim's clean
Night scope on a silence carbine
Place my crosshairs on my vic's eye
Squeeze the trigger
Watch the brains fly
Violent? Yeah you could call me that
Insane? You're on the right track
But turn the sounds up
So I can stay amped
Do another crew and breaak camp
The only way I sleep is in a cold sweat
You think I'm crazy?
You ain't see shit yet
Cause I love to kill and kill for fun
The microphone goes off
Like a handgun
It's goin' down now
Grab your girl hops
No excuses when the bodies
begin to drop
Look in my face fool
It look like I'm play'n
Don't become another
Victim of mic slayin'

What's up?
You want your feet in some concrete?
I got some brothers
That'll do you for gold teeth
But most the time I move, I move alone
Take a bat
Break your motherfuckin' dome
Shoot you dead in the face
With a sawed off
One hundred ten degrees
Ice don't get soft
Cause I'm hard as they come
I come correct
You can't handle the vandal hit eject
If not you better get
Out my face sucka
Or else you better be
A good bullet ducker
Cause I'm a rip shop
Tell that ass drop
Five o Ice, yo fuck a damn cop!
Cause I move hard and cold
With a gangster stroll
Five thousand dollar suits
And fly gold
Rolex, you can't fit no more
Diamonds on it
Pinky ring, worth a house
If I decide to own it
What's up now punk?
Yo start to choke up?
You try to move on the Ice
You'll get broke up!

Midnight, time for a homicide
Showtime, somebody's gonna die
E hits the switch
And thouands of volts connect
With the weapon that's in my fist
I see a sucka in the third row
Try'n to riff
A paragraph and a half he's stiff
I start bustin' off barrages ear high
Mothers grab for their children
Tears fly
I'm like a psycho
In the mircrophone zone
Speakers blown, mind gone
I can't be touched
Once my lyrics begin to fly
Simple stage radiation
Could make ya die
Ya got a prob nigga
you think your rep's bigger?
Hold your heard right there
While I squeeze the trigger
Cause I'm a crazy motherfucker
That's no joke
My favorite smell is
The aroma of gunsmoke
I'm bustin' off another
Lyrical nightmare
Parents hate the Ice!
You think that I care?
Well I don't give a fuck
Cause I rhyme tough
Drop science, still bust the ill stuff
So now it's time for crime
And  the rhyme is mine
Track the movement
Hide from the punchline
I rhyme with quickness

The assassinator
Stay off the shit list",Mic Contract
Ice-T,"Midnight chillin' at A.M P.M.
Coolin' drinkin' apple juice
In Evil's BM
The sound's up loud
To attract attention
rmoraled tires
On a lowered suspension
Nardi to steer with
Alpine deck was glowin'
Bumpinn' Big Daddy
And the nigga was definitely flowin'
I was ridin' shotgun
Donald and Hen in back
Look through the tint recognized a jack
Two brothers strolled up
Talkin' bout get out
Donald D blazed
Shot one fool through his fuckin' mouth
Why would they step
When they know we're strapped?
I never cruise L.A.
Without a Gat in my lap
The other fool shot
Caut the E in the shoulder blade
I busted through the ca door
That's where the nigga laid
Hen jumped out
Dropped two nines in his forehead
Evil was bleedin' bad
The car seats were turnin' red
Looked to my left
There were two more carloads
Niggas in hats and hoods
In an attack mode
And they hadn't yet begun to fight
E hit the gas
It was one past midnight!

We boned down Vernon
Right on Normandie
Left on Florence
Gettin' through the E.T.G.'s
Spun out on Vermont
Made a left on Colden
Right on Hoover
E where we goin'?
He didn'T even answer that
Checked the reaar view
They were still out back
Where were these brothers from?
What made these brothers come
Bang! our back window
Was removed by a shotgun
Now Hen G was shot
Don caught a ricochet
These motherfuckers was ill
They didn't come to play
Bust a right turn, parked
and then we got left
Hid in the the bushes
Shot the gas tank to fake death
But would this really
Keep them psyched?
Three of us bleedin'
It was ten past midnight!

I really didn't like
How this shit was goin' down
Wrong night, wrong time
Wrong fuckin' part of town
Ya see we was deep
In the Hoover's hood
Three niggas bleedin'
That shit don't look good!
See over there red don't go
Some places red's all they know
But not our luck
Tonight we was real fucked
Borke down an alley
And we instantly had to duck
Fuckin' police on a gang sweep
No time to deal with one time
So we had to creep
Broke through a back yard
Ran through a vacant lot
E, Hen and Don kept up
To be some niggas shot
Shit was gettin' craazy
So I had to get busy
Hen was bleedin' worse
And Evil was gettin' dizzy
Looked in a parking lot
I needed a snatch bar
Had to hot wire
So I moved on an old car
It was a bucket, but fuck it, it had to do
Started it up
And scooped my whole crew
Two blocks later
We saw fuckin' blue lights
The pigs were behind us
It was half past midnight!

When they pulled us over
Shit got worse
I waited till they got out
And then I hit reverse
Fucked 'em up, I seen one cop fall
Threw it in gear, yo I'm outty y'all
Don't know how
But somehow we got away
Lost the jackers, the cops
Dumped the G.T.A.
Made it back to the hood
Fixed the crew up
And even though Evil's car blew up
We made it home and then I crashed out
Thinkin' bout my all-night death bout
Then somethin' woke me up
From my dark sleep
The sound of fuckin' police
When they're tryin' to creep
Broke through my door
With no goddamn warning
Looked at my watch
It was six in the mornin'!",Midnight
Ice-T,"It's been a long while
Since I hit ya with freestyle
High tech selections
From  the vaults of the Ice files
Kick back relax
And watch as I melt wax
Don't ever let a borther llike me
Ride a dope track
Cause once I hit it with the vocltone
It's mine, have motherfuckers
Rush'n to rewind
Cause I'll flow slow
And still twist your tongues up
Rock the house from night
Till the sun's up
Cause it relly ain't
How much you say
it's what you sy
I got no fuckin' time on the mic
To play
I write rhymes
With addition and algebra
Mental geometry
Don't even come at me
Talk'n that weak and
Popin' that bullshit
Get out my face
A fool could get his head split
A lot of doubters
Said it couldn't be done by me
them same suckers
Are now lookin' from under me
Wonder'n what i did
I didn't play myself kid
I respected my faans
And made the high bid
Sometimes I write my rhymes
At night and fall asleep
Wake up with new techniques
Grab the pen
And place it on some loose leaf
Nothin' soft, always  the tough meat
The white paper and
Blue lines excite my mind
Not allow'n me to stop the rhyme
Until  the whole motherfuckin'
Book's complete
Then I write on the
Back of the sheets
I maade  promise
To my brothers in street crime
We'd get paid with  the use
Of a sweet rhyme
We put our minds together
Made the tracks clever
Now we're checkin'
More bank than ever

CHORUS
Mind over matter

I can drop rhymes in twos,
And threes and fours
nd still have much shit
Left for encores
Cause once my mind locks
In on a dope idea
Mothercukin' ducks
Should stand clear
Cause I'm a hit the topic point blank
It's jail ya better keep your shank
Cause I got mine
And I'm out on a solo creep
(Uggga!) Your face hits the concrete
You want to roll
With the niggas that don't play
I think you got false courge
Get out my damn way
Cause  the car I'm in
Is rollin' full of men
No kids or boys, E got the Mac 10
Islam's got the Zulu Nation back up
DJ Aladdin's who
Hooked the fuckin' track up
Syndicate's make'n the move
With  the ski masks
And I'm house'n the long cash
So now you realize
You underestimated the Ice
You thought that I was OK
But now you realize I'm nice
But that's alright
Cause I knew I'd mke it in the end
Those who like me now
Might not of liked me then
But I'm a keep impressin'
Stressin' my lesson
And keep motherfuckers guessin'
Armor plate my mind
With walls and shields
As I escape from the killing fields
Mind over matter

Wise up
Move the tempo of this hype groove
You know this shit is dope
So what you try'n to prove
Vu's max as Evil E
My niggaa dogs the wax
My brain's a handgrenade-catch
I'm a hit you with an over load
Of bottomless thought
Reversin' all the shit you're taught
Then throw words at you
Syl-la-ble-at-a-time
Your brain recites the rhyme
No matter what you do
The power's over you
when you sleep
You'll be say'n these rhymes too
Cause the brain has the power
To control all
Think positive
You'll be unable to fall
Brain cells swell
Thought process becomes a trance
Makes you feel possessed to dance
I'll say I want a million
My mind is so deep
I'll be bustin' a check for it next week

CHORUS",Mind over Matter
Ice-T,"Hustler, word, I pull the trigger long,
Grit my teeth, spray till every nigga's gone.
Got my block sewn, armored dope spots,
Last thing I sweat's a sucka punk cop.
Move like a king when I roll, hops,
You try to flex, bang, another nigga drops.
You gotta deal with this cause there's no way out,
Why?  Cash money ain't never gonna play out.
I got nothin to lose, much to gain,
In my brain, I got a capitalist migraine.
I gotta get paid tonight, you muthafuckin right.
[something] my grip, check my bitch, keep my game tight.
So many hos on my jock, think I'm a movie star.
Nineteen, I got a fifty thousand dollar car.
Go to school, I ain't goin for it,
Kiss my ass, bust the cap on the Moet.
Cause I don't want to hear that crap,
Why?  I'd rather be a New Jack-----Hustler

(kid drop in)
Yo man you know what I'm sayin?
You got it goin on my man, I like how it's goin down.
You got the fly cars, the girls, the jewels.
Look at that ring right there,
I know it's real, it's gotta be real.
Man, you the flyest nigga I seen in my life!
Yo man, I just want to roll with you man,
How can I be down?

What's up?  You say you want to be down?
Ease back, or muthafucka get beat down.
Out my face, fool I'm the illest,
Bulletproof, I die harder than Bruce Willis.
Got my crew in effect, I bought em new Jags,
So much cash, gotta keep it in Hefty bags.
All I think about is keys and Gs
Imagine that, me workin at Mickey D's (ha ha ha ha).
That's a joke cause I'm never gonna be broke,
When I die there'll be bullets and gunsmoke.
Ya don't like my lifestyle?  Fuck you!
I'm rollin with the New Jack crew.
And I'm a hustler.

H-you-S-T-L-E-are hustler
New Jack, New Jack..........

Here I come, so you better break North,
As I stride, my gold chains glide back and forth.
I care nothing bout you, and that's evident.
All I love's my dope and dead presidents.
Sound crazy?  Well it isn't.
The ends justifies the means, that's the system.
I learned that in school then I dropped out,
Hit the streets, checked a grip, and now I got clout.
I had nothing, and I wanted it.
You had everything, and you flaunted it.
Turned the needy into the greedy,
With cocaine, my success came speedy.
Got me twisted, jammed into a paradox.
Every dollar I get, another brother drops.
Maybe that's the plan, and I don't understand,
God damn----you got me sinkin in quicksand.
But since I don't know, and I ain't never learned,
I gotta get paid, I got money to earn.
With my posse, out on the ave,
Bump my sounds, crack a forty and laugh.
Cool out and watch my new Benz gleam,
Is this a nightmare?  Or the American dream?
So think twice if you're coming down my block,
You want to journey through hell?  Well shit gets hot.
Pregnant teens, children's screams,
Life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam.
You don't come here much, and ya better not.
Wrong move (bang), ambulance cot.
I gotta get more money than you got,
So what, if some muthafucka gets shot?
That's how the game is played,
Another brother slayed, the wound is deep
BUT they're givin us a Band Aid.
My education's low but I got long dough,
Raised like a pit bull, my heart pumps nitro.
Sleep on silk, lie like a politician,
My Uzi's my best friend, cold as a mortician.
Lock me up, it's genocidal catastrophe,
There'll be another one after me!
A hustler.
Hustler.
H-you-S-T-L-E-are hustler.

New Jack, New Jack......",New Jack Hustler
Ice-T,"Ten years ago
I used to listen to rappers flow
Talkin' bout the way
They rocked the mic at the disco
I liked how that shit was goin' down
With my own sound
So I tried to write rhymes
Somethin' like them, my boys said,
""That ain't you Ice,

That shit sounds like them.""
So I sat back, thought up a new track
Didn'T fantasize, kicked the pure
Facts. Motherfuckers got scared
Cause they weas unprepaired
who would tell it how it relly was?
Who dared?
A motherfucker from the West Coast
L.A. South Central fool
Where the Crips and the Bloods play
When I wrote about parties
It didn't fit
Six in the Mornin'
That was the real shit

O.G. Original Gangster

When I wrote about parties
Someone always died
When I tried to write happy
Yo I knew I lied, I lived a life of crime
Why play ya blind?
A simple look
and anyone with two cents
would know I'm
A hardcore player fromhe streets
Rappin' bout hardcore topics
Over hardcore drum beats
a little different
Than the average though
Jet you through the fast lane
Drop ya on death row
Cause anybody who's been there
Knows that life ain't sho lovely
On the blood-soaked fast track
That invincible shit don't work
Throw ya in a joint
You'll be comin' out feet first
So I blst the mic with my style
Sometimes I'm ill
The other times buck wild
But the science is always there
I'd be a true sucker
If I acted like I didn'T care
I rap for brothers just like myself
Dazed by the game
In a quest for extreme wealth
But I kick it to you hard and real
One wrong move, and you caps peeled
I ain't no super hero
I ain't no Marvel Comic
But when it comes  to game I'm atomic
At droppin' it straight
Point blank and untwisted
No imagination needed, cause I lived it
This ain't no fuckin' joke
This shit is real to me
I'm Ice-T

O.G.

Two weeks ago I was out at the disco
Two brothers stepped up to me
And said
""Hey yo, Ice
We don't think you're down
What set ya claimin'?""
E drew the Glock, yo my set's aimin'!
Dumb motherfucker
Try to roll on me, please!
I'm protected by a thousand emcees
and hoodlums and hustlers
And bangers with Jeri curls
we won't even count the girls
Cause they got my back
And I got theirs too
Fight for the streets
When I'm on Oprah or Donahue
They try to sweat a nigga
But they just didn'T figure
What my wit's as quick as a hair trigger
""He's not your everyday-type
Prankster.""

I'm Ice-T, the original gangster

So step to me
If you think that you're ready to
Got on your bullet proof?
Well mine's goin' right through
This ain't no game to me
It's hollow fame to me
Without respect frome streets
So I don't claim  be
The hardest motherfucker on earth
Catch me slippin, I can even get worked
But I don'T slip that often
there's a coffin
Waitin' for the brother
Who comes off soft when
The real fuckin' shit goes down
Take a look around
all them pussies can be found
they talk a mean fight
But fight like hoes
I'm from South Central, fool
Where everything goes
Snatch you out your car so fast
You'll get whiplash
Numbers on your roof top
For when the copters pass
Gang bangers
Don't carry no switch blades
Every kid's got a Tec 9 or a
Hand grenade
Thirty-seven killed
Last week in a crack war

Hostges tied up
And shot in a liquor store
Nobody gives a fuck
""The children have to go to school.""
Well, moms, good luck
Cause the shit's fucked up bad
I use my pad and pen
And my lyrics break out mad
I try to write about fun
andthe goodtimes
But the pen yanks away and explodes
And destroys the rhyme
Maybe it's just cause of where I'm from
L.A. that was a shot gun!

Ice-T,"Watch me flip and rip
On the freedom tip
Open your mind
See the point of  the ice pick
I stand tall
While my brothers
Still choose to crawl
Black power, it7s in effect y'all
But you don't understand
You're still a slave to the man
Prepare for revolution
Some sucker say we're free
I gotta disagree
Half my posse's in the penitentiary
So I'm a drop and kick the science
With defiance
Because I have no alliance
With suckas who choose
Not to act Black
When they are Black
Get out my face with that
You better ease back
Cause Mandela did 27 hard ones
Not in a windowed room
But in a barred one
While his wife had tears in her eyes
The man is a hero
He needs a Nobel Prize
But that will never happen
So I'm gonna keep rappin'
Freein' my brothers' minds
From their entrapment
To silence the Ice, they'll probably
Put a bullet in me
But I'm prepared to die
And Mandela's free!",Prepared to Die
Ice-T,"Just checkin' my microphone once
As I check your audio
Increase the bass response
Hope n the speakers blow
I got no time to sit and flip
And pop bullshit
Turn up your stereo hops
Insert the rhyme clip
Roll your windows up
Make sure it7s air tight
E.Q. the track exact
So shit sounds right
I rhyme of death
And darkness and danger
Your crib or car
Becomes a torture chamber
I write my rhymes with violence
What you expect?
Sounds of pain
The snap of a broken neck
All alone in darkness I sit each night
Write my rhymes
With blood upon a butcher knife
You say the Ice is ill, and ill I am
They try to ban my shit
And I don't give a damn
Roll up, your eye will get swoll up
Suckers who flexed
Yo, their deaths got tolled up
Cause I'm not the nigga to toy with
Boy with the big mouth
Ya got time to riff?
There's time to take you out
Put a couple caps in your ass
Cut your head off

Send it to your mom with flowers
Cause I'm so soft
Lay on your wack crew
Smoke the whole bunch
Bury 'em in my bck yard
And then I'll eat lunch
Cause I don't give a fuck about you
Or him or her
Whenever I'm in the house
A death just might occur
Is this real or fiction
You'll never know

CHORUS
While you're locked to the
Pulse of the rhyme flow!

Once I lock you up, you can't get loose
You put your head inside
And I placed the noose
The mic drips juice slow
From its steel mesh
My words feel like hooks
Underneath your flesh
Makin' you twist and turn
Scorch and burn, when will you learn?
The '90s are my turn
To pitch a vocal fit, like the ultimate
Gangster rhyme, yo, I invented the shit!
Watch me dod it, as I do it
And I do it right
Grab the gauge
Duct tape on  the flashlight
Doin' the black ski mask
And come to your house
Cut off your power
And do you with the lights out!
Is this real or fiction?
You'll never know

CHORUS

A pool of blood
and floating body parts
Would make me grin
A close view of a razor
When it's breaking skin
If you were burnin'
I'd use gasoline to put you out
Cause I walk alone
And choose the dark route
Nightmares gotta be loved by some
And I'm the one
Ya want to come, bring your shotgun
You ever see your partner die?
No? Well I have!
You ever see your father die?
No? Well I have!
You ever see your mother die?
No? Well I have!
So shut the fuck up, punk
And clear the rhyme path!
What would make meel calm and nice
Is a slow slice
Through your jugular and windpipe
Throw me in jail
I won't even try to make bail
Put me in the gas chamber
And watch me inhale!
Is this true or false?
Well you'll never know

CHORUS

Jason, Tales from the Crypt
And the Dark Side
Another fly murder, another suicide
Did these flicks
Have an influence on my brain?
I really doubt that shit
I think that I was born insane
When I was young
I had a lust for knives and guns
Use a magnifying glass
To fry an ant with the sun
And on and on
My lust for death got bigger
At fifteen
I was placed behind a trigger
Although I'm dirty
Not the one to be swept up
step up, I'd love to open your chest up
I've got no concept of life or death
All I want is your last breath
Give me a motherfuckin' break
I should behave
Give me a motherfuckin' shovel
I'll dig graves!
I break ill in extra large portions
where's your parents
I'll make you an orphan
So when you're talkin' crazy
You better think of me
The I, to the see, to the E, to the fuckin' T!
There'll be no tears
No screams or cries, just a laser beam
Between your fuckin' eyes
You feel strange well now you know

And I'm shackled down
Myself that's who I trust
The minute I arrived
Some sucker got hit
Shanked ten times
Behind some bullshit
Word in the pen the fool was a snitch
So without hesitatin'
I made a weapon quick
If found a sharp piece of metal
Taped it to a stick
Then a bullhorn sounds
That means it's time for chow
My first prison meal
The whole feeling was foul
It wasn't quite my style
But my stomach growled
So I flushed the shit down
And hit the weight pile
The brothers was swole
The attitudes was cold
Felt the tension on the yard
From the young and the old
But I'm a warrior
I got my ground to hold
So I studied the inmates
To see who hd the power
the Whites? The Blacks?
Or just the gun tower!

In a blink of an eye, a riot broke out
Blacks put their backs to the wall
Cause it was north and south
A gun man shouts
And everybody had doubt
Until the bullets started fly'n
Took two men out
Thn they rushed everybody
Back to their cells
Damn the pen is different than
The county jail
I'm in a one man cell
I know my life's on a scale
I wonder if that gunman is goin' to hell
This is my second day
I got a ten year stay
I learned my first lesson
In the pen you don't plaay
I saw a brother kill another
Cause he said he was gay
But that's the way it is
It been that way for years
and when his body hit the ground
I heard a couple of cheers
It kind of hurt me inside
That they were glad he died
and I ask myself
Just who had the power?
The Whites? The Blacks?
Or just  the gun tower!

You see the Whites got a thing
The call White pride
The Blacks got the muscle
Mexicans got the knives
You better be wise
You want to stay alive
Go toe to toe with a sucka
No matter wht size
A fool tried to sweat me
Act'n like he was hard
I stuck him twice in  the neck
And left him dead in the yard
It was smooth how I did it
Cause nobody could see
With my jacket on my arm
And my knife on the side of me
Bam bam, it was over
Another one bites the dust
I went crazy in the pen
With nobody to trust
Bench'n ten quarters, so I'm hard to sweat
Used a tat gun, and engrved my set
They call me a lifer
Cause I'm good as dead
I live in the hole, so the floor's my bed
And I ask myself again
Who has the power
The Whites? The Blacks?
Or just the gun tower",The Tower
Ice-T,"Once again I'm back in the place to be
The I, the see, the E, the T

And you're goin' to sleep
But when you see me
Walkin' down the street
You say, ""What's up Ice?""
And I say, ""Peace!""
You give me a dap, I give you one back
Cause I ain't souped

A bitch with a knife, a bitch with a gun
A bitch with a ass big as a TV set
And there's a bitch over there; hey, the one I'm gonna get
But yo but maybe not, she might not like me though
No sweat to a vet; I'll slam her sister, though
Ice in the whole damn herd

Who likes to fuck me with her ass up on the kitchen sink

Of how the bitches treat a motherfuckin fly nigga like you

I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one of them
I don't trip on hoes, cause I don't need none of them
Pussy's the temptation, dick's the persuasion
All hoes suck cock nigga how you play 'em?
That's why I don't sleep on 'em, I just freak on 'em
Stick dick in they mouth; take it out and I skeet on 'em
The nigga the one-nighter, the bitch exciter
I only love my hoes when I'm goin up inside her
Problem number one is gettin money
I'd rather taste the green than sip the honey
So don't expect nuttin cause I ain't offerin
I go hard on my bitches, cause I'm never never softenin
Puttin the demand on 'em, fuck 'em and scram on 'em
The ""wham, bam, thank you ma'am"" game is ran on 'em
So fuck how you feel, you fuckin cheap thrill
I hope you took the pill cause I won't pay the bill
Gettin pussy's just another expense
If pussy pays the bills then dick pays the rent
I only need a ho for one thing and that's to cum
I've got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one!

Ha! Yo Marquis my motherfucker you got problems man?
(A bitch ain't one) Aww shit!

I got a bitch that's cool
A bitch that's hot
A bitch who loves rap, a bitch who loves rock
A bitch who's lost and one who knows where it's at
She gets up under me and purrs like a cat
I got a bitch that runs, I got a bitch that walks
I got a bitch that yells, I got a bitch who talks
I got a bitch that's dirty, got a bitch that's neat
I got a super fine bitch that I knocked in the swap meet

And I love 'em all, I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me

Ice-T,"""Yo what's up man? Yeah I gotta trunk fulla this shit
Word, broads still with me man, comin over to grapevine right now
Yo I can't talk right now man, I gotta get off this phone""

Damn, how'd I get into this scam
Roll in a car with the trunk worth 5000 grand
I came up from the curb, word
First thing it rocks, now my ride's packin crazy birds
I gotta freak in the front seat
She got crazy game, might even have more than me
And that's why I don't trust, I ain't no busta
One wrong move and I'll dust her
But she knows that, keeps a gat
Works much plastic, always stays on phat
She said she loves me
Looks deep in my eyes, sometimes cries, all lies
She only loves my cash flow, long dough
The falso love of a pimp and a hoe
But me and her gotta job to do
Get this luggage back to the crew
She got scanner, I hadta listen to the pigs talk
And if they speakin about us then its jumpin off
But I ain't sweatin them at all
2 cops'll roll up and 2 cops'll fall
The lines on the highway, I'm makin my mind drift away
To my last jail stay
5 years for a 459
I'm never goin back, no matter what the crime
Surrenderin ain't me
Fuck that, I'm holdin court in the street G
For a nigga like me there ain't no ounce
My life filled with drug busts and shoot outs
Pure ghetto anger, pure ghetto anger
Pure ghetto anger, I'm addicted to danger
Some nights I crash clubs
Rollin with the posse made of well-known thugs
Cool out with the freaks
Truckin much jewels, beggin for beef
Thens some niggaz roll up
Lookin for a way to pump the reps up
But I ain't the one
I'm handin out beat downs, no need for guns
Sometimes I gotta ask myself
Is all this buck whylin good for a niggaz health?
I don't know why
Am I suicidal, do I want to die?
The answerin, simple
A headache throbs in my temple
It says it ain't fair, it says it ain't right
It says its goin down tonight
We finally made it to the drop spot
King and Weston Ave, snoody fox
The posse was there, but it ain't right
Fuckin police lights
Its all goin down that road blocks
I never seen that many cops
It was a setup, my whole damn crew's gettin wet up
Big time, some motherfucker dropped a dime
But even in the flurry of gun shots
My adrenaline was boilin hot
I crash down on the floor of the ride
Punch the gas, drove that benz through they punk ass
Hit Vernor doin 90
Looked in the rear-view, no one behind me
I got on the phone
Called up the homies to see what went wrong
But no time to sweat that
I still gotta trunk fulla shit, I was on phat
I just need a cool place to hide
Dumped the benzo, slammed the G ride
Me and a freak hit a motel crash spot
The streets was hot
Rubbed me down, said she adored me
Said the gunfire made her horny
The she pushed me back on the bed
Licked me head to toe, toe to head
Then I closed my eyes real slowly
Is this love? No not me
Then I felt a pain in my chest
The smell of gun powder and burnt flesh
I looked in her face, opened my mouth
And then her badge came out",Addicted to Danger

Ice-T,"Intro:

Yeah!  Right about now motherfuckers is layin for a nigga like me Ice-T
to bust some freestyle shit... but I don't do that
I just cold lounge up here at the Ammo Dump
with my nigga Alladdin, SLJ, LP and my nigga Henry G
Yeah, we do the shit like this

Verse One:

The card after the ace is deuce
So cut the nigga loose on the 3
That's me
The motherfuckin T
I got ride on my surfboard
Rhyme hard
But only buy the shit that I can't afford
That's everything
That's why I truck big fat rings
Cause in the motherland gold is for kings
I got backup
To jack up
Punks who try to act up
Do a world tour
Watch the big bank stack up
Motherfuckers get dropped with the quickness
I got an ill left and a right fist
Make mistakes and you'll lose
Or you might die
Cause I'm the wrong Ice for your bruise
And that's no lie
Meanwhile the penile is stacked to the top with my niggaz
Mostly for squeezin triggas
I call em homies
Pigs call em crooks
So I write and put bucks on they books
I give a fuck about a cop or a G-man
They all talk shit
Their breath smellin like semen
I catch em in the alley all alone
Put em in the prone
Pop! Pop! Pop! To the dome

Chorus:

It's the G-style
Gangsta style

Verse 2:

G Style, The gangsta talk
I got a teflon .9
And it eats vest
I take a motherfucker out quick
Just for talkin shit
Ride Rolls
Catch hoes like a mitt
LA, Atlanta, New York
Yo, my shit rocks
Chi-town, Miami, Detroit
I get much props
Because I roll with the hardcore G
Every street's the same street to me
I don't bullshit
I don't quit
Writin a rhyme fit
KKK pray each day
That I get hit
Motherfuckers try to flip on the Icepick
Move and slip
Close the eyes and catch a fuckin clip
Not in the ghetto no more
But I do hang
Got a black game
And it's sittin on them thangs
I kick the game from the street
Not the slamma
Tighten up my knockas with a big lead hammer

Chorus

Verse Three:

Some of the times
I write my raps with extreme speed
Some of the times
I take the pen and make pads bleed
My mind clicks to Homocide
Bullets fly
Ladies cry
A lot of people die
Some nights I can't right
Stare at the blue lines
I think I'm a go blind
Then the beat becomes me
Sit in the dark
And write a whole fuckin LP
G Style, the gangsta talk
Never near soft
Hard as a knockout bout
It's no sellout
I keep crime in my rhyme
Cause it's my thing
Packed with guns
And drugs
And lots of street slang
A-be	-see-D-E-F, and LAPD
Words from a motherfuckin OG
Ammo Dump pumps the sounds that you bump in your trunk
So turn it up punk
What'cha fraid of?
What'cha made of?
Pull the pin
Set the grenade off
Blastin sounds out ya jeep
On every city street, nigga
Straight gangsta beat

Chorus

Verse Four:

Many like to dress the style, and act hardcore
Many motherfuckers are and they crack jaws
I like to lay in the cut
In a nightclub
Don't smoke bud
Drink suds
But I gets loved, mack, cool
I scope the freak with the mad backs
Hit her with the gangsta style
Cool, relaxed, bam
Put her in the Benz
Bump Too $hort, let her know
Right off the top, what's my sport
You think long
You think wrong
You got it goin on, baby doll?
But I won't sing you no love song
You either love me
Or you don't
You're either rollin tonight
Or you won't
She likes the style
Cause it don't bullshit around
tongue in my ear, real slow
And then it went down
I gotta flip into a ill mode
Pack a clip full of hype tracks
And then unload
Music for the hardcore beatdown
No weak pop shit
Strictly underground
And if you don't like the style, as I get wreck
Ease back nigga, catch a knife through the neck

Chorus",G Style
Ice-T,"[ VERSE 1 ]
Woke up the other mornin, I heard a rumor
They said the gang wars was over
I told em they was bullshittin, they said it's real as hell
Can't explain the way I felt
Too many years I seen my brothers die
And I can't say that shit was really that fly
But I used to gangbang when I was younger
So it's really hard to tell a kid that he's goin under
I never thought I lived to see us chill
Crips and Bloods holdin hands, the shit is ill
But I love it, I can't help it
Too much death on the streets, and we dealt it
Van Ness Boys, The Hoovers, The 60s
Bounty Hunters, 8-Treys, all coolin out, gee
I pray the shit'll never stop
You used to see the wrong colors, and the gats went pop-pop
But now the kids got a chance to live
And the O.G.'s got something to give
That's love, black on black, that's how they made it
And if any busters flip, they get faded
L.A. is where I'm speakin of
Peace to all the gangsters, cause I got a lotta love

[ VERSE 2 ]
I got a lotta love, cause you're all my brothers
Red or blue, black's the color
We got a chance, so we can really sweat the real fools
Show those muthafuckas the real tools
Check the enemy, it ain't the family
Not 1-11, try L.A.P.D.
They gotta understand, they beat on a blackman
There's gonna be drama, know what I'm sayin?
And if we flip, let's all flip together
Cause I'm prepared, kid, for rough weather
And we gotta realize, the boys on the east side
You call em S-A's, I call em allies
Because the day that we all unite
Watch the pigs get real polite
Punk muthafuckas gotta learn quick
That we ain't takin no more shit
L.A. is where I'm speakin of
Peace to all the gangsters, cause I got a lotta love

[ VERSE 3 ]
Crenshaw Boulevard, Sunday afternoon
Folks sittin on things, mad systems boom
The girls are lookin better
The gang truce is on, so you wear whatever
At Venice by the ocean
Rag-top Trey hits the three-wheel motion
There's gangsters all around
Still crazy sets, but you just don't clown
I pray L.A. can stay this way
It's the first summer I can really say
I felt cool, we all chilled
Went to the park, and nobody got killed
Now if you got a problem, it's man on man
You don't need a gang to solve em
I seen the greatest thing I seen in my life
Two brothers in a straight up fist fight
Nobody pulled a gat, nobody jumped in
Nobody pulled a knife, nobody got done in
L.A. is where I'm speakin of
Peace to my city, cause I got a lotta love

[ VERSE 4 ]
G-a-t-e-s, I hope you wear a vest
Even after you're out the fuckin office
Cause we're on a totally different tip
Fuck that pig brutality shit
This unity is gettin to me
Every brother on the street is my homie
I'm rollin through a hood that I never been
And every brother steps to me as a friend
I love it, I love it
And nothin in my life will ever be above it
We want to see our kids all grown up
We're tired of seein our hoods get blown up
L.A. is a great place
Fly girls, dope cars, life at a fast pace
But gangbanging was killin it quick
Another child got hit - bullshit
Pop-pop-pop, 10 on a weekend
We was goin off to deep end
But now we got a chance, my friend
To mend, and make the colors blend
Let's all go out on a picnic, kick shit
And squash all the static
Last year I lost about five homies
This shit is real to me
L.A. is where I'm speakin of
Peace to all the gangsters, cause I got a lotta love

Yo

All over South Central

They still tryin' to stop m,e shut me down block me
Make motherfuckas boycott me
But that will never happen, it's impossible
I move straight through all obstacles
They say I'm fuckin' up the minds of little kids
But half of my fans are in college
P.M.R.C. suck my dick, please
You can kiss my ass while you're on your knees
Word! You're listening to the verbal assassinator
E's the crossfader, your factual updater
Until your cranium grows like uranium
Hard as titanium, parents, I'm blamin'em
For teachin' you lies about life, racist viewpoints 
And other trite bullshit they learned back in the day
While I learned about death from an A.K.
But they'll never quite understand
Bam, bam, bam, no gat is the Walkman
Boom, bash, yeah, yo, it's goin' down
Me and Ice Cube are in town
But the fuckin' pigs cancelled the concert
They're just scared of some niggers that do work
What they do? What did I do?
Just say truth motherfucka and it's comin' through
I tell you what we did: we stole your fuckin' kids

Time to get wreck with the new style
It's '93 and MC's are gettin buck wild
But I - ain't a - nigga
That's gonna get left with a big zero as a figure
I'm gonna end up with a big sum
Cause if you don't like one jam, I always got another one
Different, specifically I don't copy
Tear up the track if the flow sounds sloppy
I don't play one game
I bust about a dozen cuts on my lp's, none the same

When I used to hustle, used to be down with the crack game
When I was young, I used to roll with a street gang
If you want to squabble, muthafucka, it ain't no thang
I ain't new to this, I ain't new to this
Blow your dome, I hit quick as a pugilist
Ugh, ah, what's up? Now your eyes swoll'
Thought I went soft, cause my records went gold

Caught you in your eye while you reached for your tool
Now it's mine, and you're blind
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop goes the nine
Yeah. what you're dissin bout, friend?
Sayin I went out, but you ain't never been in

Jump in my 4, hit the switch and lay the ass
While the Klan try to kill me
But I wrote 'riot' on my muthafuckin will, gee
So when I'm gone, it's on
Caps goin off on the streets like popcorn
Talkin bout Simon till the early morn'
Word is bond
But now I just cool
Bumpin my Gang Starr tape by my pool
I ain't new to this

Check, check, I got problems with the press
Caught the punk in traffic, stabbed the sucker in his neck

Word, I don't fantasize, I don't exaggerate
Just kick correct with the 1-2 mic check
Still quick to swing, take a sucker to the deck

The organization say they can't stay in business with us any longer
What you gonna do?

[Ice-T]
We always knew we were gonna come to this point sooner or later...
We have absolutely no option but to move forward.
We'll have to set up our own distribution, manufacturing,
run a totally independent organization and operation.
We still got our connections in Texas, Miami, New York, Chicago, 
Detroit, and soldiers on the street willing to die.
I can't put any cut on the product...
I just can't live like that.
But from now on if any cops get in our way... (5 gunshots)

[Ice-T]
Turn up the mic dog, so I can get off
Find me Charlton Heston and I might cut his head off
I'm not to be fucked with
Step in the range of my Gauge and get bucked quick
Niggas, hoes, I don't know who you are, my friends or foes
Smile in my face and plot to kill me behind doors
I got a new attitude, no trust
Got me in a corner all a nigga can do is bust
It may be you
There's gonna be a lot of dead before I'm through
I'm 'bout to break off niggas who play me and dis' me
Try to switch from side to side like they whip me
The damage is done
Source Magazine, you're the first one {*gunshot*}
You try to dis Chuck, Cube and me
How the fuck you pick us 3?
You punk motherfuckers ain't shit, you're just a bunch of hoes
Makin' money off the pros
And when I see I get you in my sights
I give your ass a story to write
Cause it's on

It's on

[Chorus: Ice-T]
It's on motherfucker and you can't turn the shit off
Catch you in the streets and your ass'll get tossed
Bang! Bang! Bang! Cause it ain't no thang
To put in work and watch your head burst **a gunshot**

[Ice-T]
A lot of fans ain't shit
Let me repeat
A lot of fans ain't shit
Quick to flip if our group don't hit
They don't make you nothin but a pop ho bitch
And I don't need ya
I love to bleed ya
All I ever wanted was a real nigga's praise
But the sad motherfuckin' fact
Is that ain't that many real motherfuckers these days
Game knows game I know too many who plays the name
And I can make it in the music or the street game
I still got hoes that'll work, still got crews that'll hit
Still roll with an extra clip
And those who think they'll stop me, doubt it
Those motherfuckers better think about it
You'd best to let me rap
Ice back on the streets?
You don't want that
Cause I break ill
And you really after body count the caps I peel, it's on

[chorus: Ice-T]
It's on motherfucker and you can't turn the shit off
Catch you in the streets and your ass'll get tossed
Bang! Bang! Bang! Cause it ain't no thing
To put in work and watch your body jerk
It's on

[Ice-T]
It's on motherfucker you goddamn right
It's on, my royalty cheque, yeah, fool, I write my own
I own my own label put my own shit out
So no one tells me what the fuck to talk about
And all the suckas that said I was through
You need to wake up to my view
I'm fallen off
Ha! Ha!  That's a joke!
You motherfuckers are still unknown and broke
And I'm stankin' rich
My fuckin maid lives better than you, bitch
So shut your trap
When it comes to this level of game, you don't know jacks
CIA, FBI, IRS
Try to flip us out for sweat
But they'll never sweat you son
Cause you're broke and you're dumb and you're no threat to no one
Them fools don't play
I gotta deal with those motherfuckers every day
They'd love to get me behind bars
They hawk a nigga like I'm Carlos Escobar
But in a way I am
Been puttin dope on the street for years and don't give a damn
So I'm thinkin about them, friend
The real motherfuckin gangstas want to see me end
It's gonna end up in a bloodbath, no doubt
That's the only way I'm going out, it's on

[Chorus: Ice-T]
It's on
It's on motherfucker and you can't turn the shit off

And I've been listenin' to a lotta DJ's

So right about now I'ma give him the muthafuckin' microphone
I'ma get behind the wheels and we gon' do this
Yo, Evil tell where the fuck it's comin' from

It's comin' from the mouth of the pimp behind the wheels
I make a bitch kneel, Evil E the gray steel
Shows, ho's, junior pimp sweat out, punk
So I can give your bitch the Evil E jump

I love you honey, sure, listen up, listen clear
After the show, yo ho' hit the rear
Backstage pass, lick stick tied on the right tit
My hopes of gettin' licked, grab that ass and then hit

Hit, hard movin' wall security will be knockin'
While Evil E's rockin', charlie jam and try blockin'
I'm a fuckin' mack that comes up by playin' the back

Cynical weapon Evil E and I'm kept in the back

Yo, what's goin on Ice?
[ Ice-T ]
Yo what's up Shawnie Shawn?
Man, just trippin off this girl, man
[ Shawnie Shawn ]
Girls?
You?
The Iceberg?
Aw man, come on, spill it, man

She was a swinger
Talkin 'bout high post
She was the most
Knew she was fine, dope, fly
She didn't have to try
She brought a eye on my eye in a crowded club
I tried to stare the girl down, but she didn't budge
She moved through the crowd in a straight line
The closer she got, mad thoughts ran through my mind
Yo, what would I say, yo, how would I chill?
My mind drew a blank, the whole scene was ill
She stepped in the light, she was dynamite
Her eyes said, ""I wanna be with you all night
I wanna rub you down, I wanna kiss, caress your soul
Make your body warm and cold
Do everything sexually you ever heard""
And she hadn't said a single word..
I said, ""Damn, what the hell am I gonna do?""
But my eyes said the same things too
I tried to speak, she put a finger across my lips
Followed it with a kiss
She said, ""I want you bad,"" and she moved in next to me
This woman spelled out ecstacy
Said, ""I've seen on the movies and TV
I love your records, but I ain't no groupie
Just wanna love ya, cause you're a real man
And you deserve this lovin like only I can""
I wanted her bad, and I am a man
That night the shit hit the fan

[ Shawnie Shawn ]
Damn, man
Keep on with it, man
Come on now kick it, man
You gotta kick it right, though
Let me know what's up

She had a 500 S-E-L airtight
Cellular phone, brand-new, it was white on white
As we walked to the car, I couldn't help but recognize
Her small waist and sexy thighs
She had a beach house she owned and a restaurant
Took me in her crib and put Sade on
As the waves hit the rocks in the moonlight
She came up behind me and squeezed me real tight
My mind started to trip, flip, roll, and roam
What about my girl who's at sleep at home?
But before I could lock in on that thought
She broke out with a new men's watch that she had bought
She put it round my wrist, it was a perfect fit
And said in my ear, ""Want you to have it""
Then she unzipped her dress, dropped it to the ground
My mind was totally blown by now
She gazed at me nude in the moonlight
Pumps still on, her body was firm and tight
I looked at her breasts as they glistened and rised
Right before my eyes
And all I could say to myself was, ""Damn..""
The night the shit hit the fan

[ Shawnie Shawn ]
Man, man, man
I understand...
(The night the shit hit the fan)
Come on now
I feel it
Come on
(The night the shit hit the fan)
Damn, man
It's all that
Shit
Come on, Ice
Kick that shit

Now I'm a player, I been all around the world
Made love to many girls
But tonight this was the big league
And I was worryin about fatigue
I wanna do this girl, so she won't forget me
And I knew that she'd let me
She moved close and took my shirt off
She said my skin was soft
Then slipped her hand
Between my stomach and my waist band
Man, I couldn't take it no more
Fuck the bedroom, we use the kitchen floor
We hit skins all weekend
We didn't even eat, we just hit em again
I love to think about how it went down
But she's no longer around
Left town with some fly guy
She's on some island drinkin D'Acqueray's and Mai Thai's
But she gave me the keys to the beach house
She knows what I'm about, at least now she figured out
I ain't nothin but a straight up man
And I might need those keys the next time the shit hits the fan

Yeah

Uh!

Yeah

Uh..

Yeah

Uh

I want her

You always know, man

You meet another one like the other one 

",Shit Hit the Fan
Ice-T,"I was born in new jersey, I said it before
But I guess nobody heard me
My mother died young
No sistas or brothas, I was the only son
When I was twelve my pops died too
What a brotha was supposed to do?
They sent me out West
To live with my aunt
I guess they though it was the best
But there was no love there
Growin' with no moms 
I guess I was prepared to live in a vacuum
The bedroom the kitchen, the hall and the bathroom
I didn't leave home much, didn't like L.A.
Didn't have no friends to trust
Got busted to a school
Blacks and whites, I guess the shit was cool
But in highschool I changed
Didn't want to bust, didn't want to play the game
I walked to Crenshaw high, shit was fly
I hooked up with new cru
Some brothas that knew what the fuck to do
You might call it gang but we called it a set
And it was our own thang
The whole school was down
And one way or another everybody fucked around
When the hardcore or not
you wore the right color or your ass got shot
That's how i'm livin'...
I did three years in and made close friends
Havin' no love my homies came my only
I was glad: a family I never had
But I grew up fast got a girl on 10th grade pregnant
Needin' cash, I had to change my style
Switched from bangin' to hustlin'
No more goin' buckwild
Had to get a cashflow
But my hustle was weak, it was a no go
I join the army, four years in that shit
Be all fucked you can be
Came back to the hood
My homies had done good
Had elevated their game
About 100 gees a lick, no mothafuckin' shame
Passed for the jewels
Baby sledgehammers with the tools
I speak on this with a hesitation
Even though it passed the statue of limitation...
I checked the bank
Bought a porsche and gear, earn high streetrank
But as I grew my whole crew fell through
Cops had us on the books as innerstate crooks
Murder robbery rape escape, the whole damn nine
You robbed a nigga blind
I had too much juice, I cut my boosters loose
I was intread with the pimpgame
Took on the ice-name
But the pimpgame moved too slow
Especially for a nigga who was hooked on quick dough
In one night late I was in a carwreck
And I was lucky to escape
Hospital for teen weeks, in bed almost dead
And when I got well, I got gaught in a cross
And got locked in a jailcell
That's how I'm livin'...
They cutted me loose
And I had to change troops
This time they didn't catch me
Next time they'll strecth me
Cause my time was gettin' short
All my homies was in court
Or locked in a hole, this shit was gettin' old
So I changed my life
Putted down the gun and picked up the mic
It took ten years to get from there to here
But I still keep a gun, cops got me on the run
And they hate me more now
Than they ever did before
My homies came back from pen
And we all worked together 
True friends but every once and while
Some punk mistakes me as a junk
And he gets in my face
Wrong mothafuckin' place
And I ain't lyin', that's how you dyin'...",That's How I'm Livin'

I got my nigga SLJ and DJ Aladdin

1993
And it's still me
A rappin brother from L.A., the cool T
Diss a brother, hate a brother, I still come back
With the fat tracks, fuck the pop crap
I got a mind to cold diss a fool
Wack rappers sellin out urge me to pull tools
For no reason
Pop suckers hookin for hits like hoes skeezin
Prostitutes that can't shoot, yet you clock loot
Dancesteps with the weak styles, but you look cute
Bitch, that shit's wack
Let Hammer dance, and you other fools ease back
The microphone in some twist in a clenched fist
Mind locked on ???? load of my hit list
And make duck rappers pray
Many talk shit, but none step this way
Cause I'm quick to beat down a weak clown
Clock crazy juice from L.A. to the Boogie Down
I play the whole map
Got hoes locked like a muthafuckin bear trap

Before hoes gee they need two forms of I.D.
Never fess, not the best, but I'm hard to shake
Huh, watch the Ice break

Watch the Ice break

Yo, let's see now who's tryin to diss me
Say I sold out cause I rocked with the B.C.
y'all are bitches, you're straight wack
Quick to talk shit, but always behind the back
I do whatever I want to do, punk hoe
I rock a perm, you rock an afro
I wear khakis, while y'all wear silk
y'all drink forties, and I drink milk
Cause that's my muthafuckin biz
I never sell out, cause it's no sale, kid
Hardcore to my heart from the fuckin start
Whether done over beats or loud guitars
I drop the dope hits
Case you forgot, I invented this gangsta shit
You want to step to me? New jack, walk
Come back in five LP's, then we can talk
You're just new, kid, you got a hit out
In interviews you talk a lotta shit out
You got paid, you really made out
You went broke when your one jam played out
Now you're searchin for that one more hit
Shhhiiit
I ain't new to this, I got gangs of gold
I come original, then I break the mold
Too many MC's hit, then fold
They're just fakes
Hah, watch the Ice break

Watch the Ice break

Yeah
Syndicate jumpin off 1993
On some old fly smooth shit
All the muthfuckas out there down with us
You know what I'm sayin?
We're rollin strong
All the busters out there that got some static to say
We're settin this shit off physically this year
Like KRS-One says:
Sucker MC's duck down
Muthafuckas ain't takin no shit
I'm swingin on busters, point-blank
Diss me and it's on
Straight up

Now it's the break of dawn
And the mic is still on
All hoes are fuckin and the rhymes are damn strong
Many MC's that choke from the mic smoke
Those who tried to get with me
Lost in rhyme infinity
Or they lost breath
Try to step to the Ice equals sure death
Cause ??it's then I begin?? than you ever assume
Drop the mic, go rap in your living room
I love the quick kill
Swing on a nigga sometimes just to break ill
Knuckle up, buster, fool, in his fuckin eye
All hands, I need no gun, yo punk, why?
Cause if I pull my gun, you die
No second try
I gotta cool out now, so I don't over-freeze
Nut up and start murderin MC's
Start catchin bodies from state to state
Throw on a ski mask and walk the streets late
And do me up a whole damn crew
The Geto Boys was trippin, but my mind's trickin me too
Cause diss me, and I meet you one day
And bet your life it won't be a fun day
I hope, nigga, it's not your fate
That you're around when the Ice breaks

Ice-T,"Hey, boy!

Once upon a time a DJ's task
Was just to play records, what more could you ask?
But then came remixes, scratching and cuts
Which was too much for many, drove some DJ's nuts
But the DJ named Glove has reigned supreme
As the turntable wizard of the hip-hop scene
So listen to him, check him out, but remember this
When the Glove's on the wheels of steel he's reckless

This high-powered music is truly unique
As the Glove cuts the rhythm to the hip-hop beat
He moves like a madman as he spins his disc
He's the number one scratcher on the DJ list, he's reckless

Now I've seen DJ's, too many to name
Some gained recognition and even fame
But when you talk of MC's, Ice-T is the best
And when you talk of DJ's, forget the rest, Glove's reckless

So listen very closely as the Glove throws down
He cuts like a razor to the big beat sound
Dave's layin' down a groove that we know you'll like
With the Glove on the turntables and Ice-T on the mic, we're reckless

So listen to the music, let your mind feel free
Realize you're with the master G-L-O-V-E
Dave and MC Ice-T, you know you're with the best
Because when we're in the mix you know the groove is fresh
And reckless, reckless, reck-reck-re-reckless",Reckless

Because they know I catch wreck
A well-known wild street vet
Step into the kill zone, baby, it's on
I pack the twin nine-mills that'll lift your dome
Chrome pump with double-eyed slots and such
A fully-auto Mac-dime that is sure to touch
Ya, bust you with the Desert Eagle
Street legal, move against my peole
And the Ice gets evil
Hit you with the .44 Smith & Wes-
Son, you're best to run cause my Tec eats pests
I got a glock with the laser, hot police taser
Step in real close, I hit your throat with the razor
You want to live or die, it's your decision
Talk shit, you're dissin, i got you in my night vision
Brain fragments on the street released
Another nigga fronts hard, another nigga deceased
I got a H.K., A.K. and a M-16
A 12-gauge street sweeper with the circular clip
Quick to let projectiles fly, you die
And watch your fat moms cry - bull's eye

What's up, niggas don't seem to hear
Still lookin crazy, let me make this clear
Fool, the Ice ain't havin it
And when I let loose lead, believe I'm accurate
Fat scope on a 30???6
Sawed-off double barrel and a pistol grip
Pump on my lap at all times
I fill my gauge shells with nickels and dimes
Thompson Center spittin .45 slugs
Black Mac-11, Python .357

Seventy Automatic, full metal jackets
Hollow points comin atcha fast

Why you want to step in the sights of a nigga
Known hair trigger, the coroner delivers
More cold bodies to the morgue each weekend
One minute you bleed, the next minute you're leakin
Best to listen close cause this ain't no boast

Bloody, sticky, holes in your Dickey's

With God by your side 
Homie what's it like? 
I know your bein' treated right
No more worries
Plus you're bein heard G 
I guess you know niggaz is still trippin
I don't know why, they see a future in it 
We're headed for self-destruction 
Can't function
Only thing I can do is pray 
And thank God, for another day 
Yes Homie, it's rough down here. I gotta watch my back 
'cause it's hard being black 
If it ain't the other
It's my own colour 
Tryin to work me 
Tryin to hurt me 
Ain't no L-O-V-E 
Please tell me why, Dear Homie

Dear Homie, gang-bangin ain't joke 
And I'm lookin over ya loc 
Always knew there was fools out to get me 
I didn't even hear the gunshots till after the slugs hit me 
I grabbed for my chest and my neck, hopin
When my head hit the ground my skull busted open 
You used to ask for my advice
Well Dear Homie, dyin ain't nothin nice
And the place I'm at is overpacked
With young blacks who crash crack and gats 
I can only pray 
You don't come this way
You gotta stay alive, you got a kid G
I feel ya partner but I worry a lot 
Bust shots
I know you're tryin' to comfort me 
But I don't want no company, Homie 

Dear Homie, even though you're gone
I still fell your presence 
Sometimes I can sleep 
'cause I just can't see
Reality like it really should be seen
I still reminisce on how we used to kick it 
Strollin' the yard, just hangin' out together 
Down for whatever, whenever 
And now I'm hopin, you're seeing a true friend in me 
We where meant to be

Dear Homie, you used to call me O.G. 
Now ya really gotta look up to me 
'cause the place I'm at, is way high in the sky
I didn't want to die 
But the life I lived was just to reckless 
Too many bad marks on God's checklist
And many many brothers will go out
Just tryin to get that hard-core street clout 
But a street reps final test, is when you're lying in a coffin 
With you're hands folded on your chest. 
Then ya hear the girls cry
Then ya hear the brothers lie 
Talkin' about how down you was 
Then the next week the back on the street, they cold forgot ya 'cause'. 
Don't wanna see ya on your back, 
So for me stay sucka free, 'cause you don't need that, Homie. 

Dear Homie... 
Dear Homie... 
Ya know I miss ya Homie...",Dear Homie

Muthafuckas fakin and frontin like they don't know what time it is
Niggas on the streets ain't really got a muthafuckin choice
Muthafucka

(So niggas is forced to do dirt)	--> Prodigy

Born hustler

I only run with real niggas who wear gold and jewels
Diamond rings, strapped with tools
I take no shorts cause I been in it for the long one, the strong one
Gotta tell the truth, yo, half my niggas is on the run
Street giant defiant to the laws
That the white man made, nigga
That's why we play, nigga
A/k/a the street hustler from the Westside
Too damn fly, too much finesse for the hoo ride
I rather take a mark off smooth
Cause the skilll of a hustler is to stick and move
And make you say: ""Damn, what's his name?
Got to give a nigga props cause the kid got game""
Mad game, fool, I base my hustle not on strength
But think, you say 'the liqor store', I say 'brinks'
Cause my mind's on the massive roll of the dice
The magnitude of my game's insane, precise

So now you're mad cause I got money and you don't
The hustlers win, the busters won't
What can I say, you can't come out and play
With the real ones, dig this
You'll get broke with the quickness
I don't gamble, I cheat when it's on
Two g's on the table, two in my palm
And if I spill up, I pull the nickel .25 strap
Then the place gets flat and then I'm out the back
With my niggas and them 4's on thangs
And if I really want to floss I flex my Bentley wings
Damn, over your head, got a problem
Keepin lyrics down to earth so normal niggas can solve em
But the game's extreme so quit your high beams
And increase the light, now can you see me, you might
If you ever been to jail or shot, sold rocks
I'm talkin 'bout weight down like movin ki's and pounds
But every nigga in the hood ain't fly
Light-skinned or dark, they're 90% marks
Straight vics and they got money to give
Then without em tell, me how the hell a hustler lives..

I got no love for a lame
I use my strategy from crack to rap, no shame
And now instead of cooking some ki's
I'm flippin million dollar ??? call em wack MC's
But suckers got it twisted, they missed it
Wastin they life when yo, they mentally gifted
The streets ain't the only fuckin hustle in town
You gotta get in where you fit in, gotta stay way down
But a buster is a buster for life
He makes excuses why his ass ain't pay
That shit's played
Cash rules everything around me, kid
I hit a 50'000 lick and never did no bid
Cause I'm bent on a come-up and my shit stays tight
How many fake gangsta rappers will I hear tonight?
It don't matter cause the real don't care
You know I'ma gonna get mine, so I'ma let em get theirs
But I know in the heart what's true
So if you listen very closely, maybe you will too
My mind's blown off Armani suits
Pavet medaillons, [Name] boots
Cristal and steak, shrimp big as your hand
I bought a silk robe and it's from Siam
This jam's for the hoods and thugs
Pimps and hoes, the slingers of drugs
Hustlers and thieves, cons and crooks
Bookers and sharks, muthafuck the marks

Just a kid, moms died when I was seven
Pops died, eleven, what's up with heaven?
It's hell when you're an orphan at a early age
This impressionable stage, no love breeds rage
In the heart of a child who never knew his roots
Looked up to pimps and to hustlers in the eel-skin boots
Parkin Caddies on the sidewalk, gangsta talk
Truckin diamonds and gold
Rubberbands around the bankrolls
Fly girls to make your head spin
Seemed they partied all night long
I was like, ""Put me on""
But they said, ""Little fellow, run and go play
Take your butt to school or else you'll have to be like us one day""
I didn't understand, but I tried to get a job
While all the players got the girls cause they'd hustle and rob
I was like makin 'bout 1-50 a week
And after taxes, you know what that is - lunch meat

And I know I can be better than this
I gotta get me a car, man
I gotta get a girl

I know I can do it out there, man
I'm finna go for it, man
I gotta get some money

Streets of anger, trouble and crime
I had it hard, had to sleep in my car sometime
But I never let another player see me down
I kept my front up, my gear clean
Even when checkin minor green
Brothers knew my game was true
So I hooked up with the real crew
That knew excactly what to do
Bank jobs and jewels, quick to flex with tools
Pimpin hoes on the block
Checkin cash non-stop
Crack spots, armor with interior bars
No lie, I used to own 'bout 15 cars
Every piece Fila made
Drape my women in suede
Pavet Piaget, Cesar's Palace holidays
It was on, crazy out of control
We made up the word 'ballin', that was how we rolled
But the FBI had a-whole-nother idea
It's called multiple indictments for hundreds of years

What
Daff is dead?
Carter got 25 years?
Nah..
Spike 35 to life?
Nah, don't tell me B.O.'s dead, man
I don't want to hear that, man
I was just with him

[ VERSE 3 ]
The game is vicious, no retirement, you die young
Listen to a fake, he might tell you to grab a gun
I get phone calls from condemned row
Brothers I ran with, brothers I really know
They tell me, ""Ice you got much love in the pen
You're the one that got away, don't want to see you in""
They tell me, ""Tell the little homies the deal
Don't let em come up in this hellish habitat of shanks and steel""
I marched two million strong in D.C.
Lookin eye to eye with brothers that I used to think below me
Damn, my mind was twisted in my hustlin days
But God spared me, I got a baby son to raise
And bein black ain't easy, prejudice is real
But health and liberty is all we need for us to build
We gotta come together, unseparated

Check me out

[Ice-T:]
It's time for me to kick game
And if I can't do it, then ladies, Ice ain't my name
Now real brothers ain't easy to understand
And it's a long hard road to become a man
Drama seeks and chases him through every year
His homie dies, you might see him shed a tear
But mostly hardcore feelings are all you see
'Cause you gotta be raw to be called a gee
But every man slows down
You'll see this side when there's probably no one around
And there's no safer place
Than if you ever are some gee's homebase
But it ain't easy, these brothers got barricades around the hearts
It's gonna take time before the trust starts
But girl, you must be true
'Cause if your man's a gee, he'll definitely die for you
Look him deep in his eyes, let him know you're there
Show him that you really care
Trust me, you move with time
Through the darkened halls of his mind
You just might find

And I know my latin homies have the same drama with they girls, man
Won't you let 'em know how it's goin down

[Jell:]
Man, I'm lookin' for a hina that's down
But you don't have to be brown
If you want to hang around
All you gotta do is stay in check
'Cause if you're rubbin' me right
Then you can bet you'll get respect
And that's why I guess my feelings will have to show
How can you hide somethin' that's in your soul?
'Cause there's more to the l-o-see
Than all the violence, baby, that ain't who I be
I know my dogs and me can still pull straps
But I rather have you rollin' in my Cadillac
'Cause when we cruisin', thangs is all good
And that goes for every vato in the hood
Now sometimes it's hard to show the other side
Especially when my crew is caught up in a homicide
'Cause East L.A. don't play
And if I had my way
I'd kick it with you everyday

Best believe the gats in my promo shots ain't props
I hang out sunroof tops and pop glocks at cops
(Yo, how ya livin?) On the mellow, coolin with my fellow
Hustlers, players, super bitch-layers
Mackaronies on the true d-l - hell, most
Fuckin with my niggas you could end up ghost
I made a million, got my shit out pawned
Bailed out the homies, now the shit's back on
Moved out the ghetto, cause I hate it
But I roll through your fuckin hood and regulate it
Cause I wasn't born to be broke, I let the .45th smoke
Before I let my baby boy go under, no wonder
I'm addicted to the cash flow, stacks of green
Flashback, I'm nudgin weights down a triple beam

Bitches, shrimps, mackin like pimps
Wearin fly shit you never seen before (raw)
I turn a angel to a whore, now need I say more?
My perm got bounce, fuck a 40 ounce
I'm sippin Cristal, pal, and represent I shall

Niggas in LA know the Ice don't play
I'm just a savage for the cabbage and a pimp parlay
I rock a million with the jewels on the paw (don't start)
Cause my niggas ain't the big ones, just big guns
Pushin the limits of this game till I gets my piece
I put my true queen Darlene in a white Corniece
So stay broke if you want to, hang out on your corner
Step back from the curb when we roll up on ya
20 black cars all tinted, we meant it
'Syndicate forever - posse of the clever'
Rubberbands strap the fat green knots
We're strictly hustlers not gangsters, but we still lick shots
For the goal

It's the LA cash flow master-roller
No one gets colder, I  used to flip boulders
Of caine, on my brain, it's outta control, crime plot
A dead-ass cop and muthafuckas get got
In the game it ain't safe for the weak or the timid
Known to break a bitch but barely rarely slide up in it
So you see me in a club, grab your woman like you want to
Blink your eyes and the freak is out there freezin on the corner
She got caught by the curls and the jewels
Lookin for a nigga that is quick to pull tools
Now she's breakin herself, makin herself
Respect my technique of pimpin, minus all simpin
Check it bitches, it ain't nothin nice
You're gonna seal or sell pussy if you roll with the Ice

I got more freaks than Heff', my bankroll's off vice
Commandin straight pimp tactics
None of y'all can match this
Meet a freak in a week, her workplace a matress
Really though, recognize the pimp type flow
I don't smoke endo, I count cash on my patio
So much love on the streets, don't need no bodyguard
Big up to my homies with the pimp type nod
I'm off the hook, checkin traps in Vegas [Name]
Full link mink with the matchin borsalino
I change cars like you change drawers, bitch
I got a stable full of thoroughbreds that make me rich
Niggas hate me, cause they can't control they roll
They see that fat old ass and start givin me cash

My mind's blown off fine champagne
So bent on currency, got green in my vein
So damn smooth that every woman want to touch me
So much sexuality that nuns want to fuck me
I kick back with my pimpin ballin brothers
Stand over the bed, dump the cash on the covers
The game's got me, I'm a slave to the roll
Hoes belong on the track and I belong in gold
Silk and satin, I deserve a pimpin pattin
Been in the life so long cause I stomp bitches who start rattin
Mostly friendly, but do got that gorilla in me
Save it for the player-hater niggas with the envy
Lot of niggas talk it, but they can't hold a hooker
Ice took her, she was too long a looker
It's strictly straight-lace hustlin on mine
I been pimpin all my life and I don't mind dyin

Everybody talkin' 'bout the way hip-hop ain't the same
Suckers kidnapped the game
I know the biggest in the business, and no joke
Half of 'em broke, and none of 'em smoke
(Bust the facts, loc)
I got into this hip-hop game
Just to try to get a girl and get some light-weight fame
There'd never been no cash made in it
So who thought you could get paid with it?

Just crash the club with my crew and then I'm outta there
Hit some skins, act bugged, that was a rap career
Then Run D.M.C. jumped the fuck off
Got mad paid, word, kicked the bucks off
There wasn't many rappers out there rockin the streets
When hip-hop was just cuts and beats
I seen Wildstyle, dug the scene
I want to be an MC, rock, rock on, know what I mean?

I started crashin' rap contests
Shootin' hardcore rhymes through wack MC's chests
I signed on the lines of a wack contract
Didn't even read it, fuck that
They gonna put my record out
I'm gonna be large, know what I'm talkin' about?

In the first 2 years I made about 300 bucks
Yo, this business sucks
But I got another chance and I came correct
Got a lawyer and accountant, now my shit's legit
But many won't get no second chance
And get fucked in this biz without a kiss or a dance
The game is to exploit young ghetto kids
A straight pimp game, and there ain't no shame
And the shit's gone too far

The game's hijacked
The rap game's hijacked
Let me tell you how it happened

Now while every MC in the game
Was worryin' about a white boy gettin' the fame
They dug out the foundation
Now let me give a demonstration
Say you got a dope group from the hood
Talkin' mad shit like they're up to no good
You take 'em to a label
Now who sits behind the table?

Some jewish mothafucka that don't know shit
Tryin' to tell y'all what's a fuckin' street hit
The shit's way off course
It's like me tellin' Johnny Cash how to sing about his horse
You go on tour, the white agency says you're wild
Tone down your style
The radio jocks are all pop
So how the fuck this nigga know what shit to rock?

The shit that make your face turn green
Is when you get dissed by a kidnap magazine
I give a fuck about these mothafuckas
I'm doin' this jam to save my hip-hop brothers
Get your paperwork straight, kid
Get a lawyer and accountant just like I did
Don't blow your dough, 'cause you will see g's
But this game has no guarantees
Learn about publishing points, so you won't be blind
Learn to read everything you sign
Then you might have a chance
If not, bend over, pull down your pants

You can go gold and still owe the record label cash
Yo kid, check the math
Learn about the word 'recoup', troop
And stop walkin' round all hyped and souped
You ain't nothin' but somethin' to be used and worked
You ain't nothin' but a sucker to be duped and jerked
'Cause the fuckin' record label don't love ya, pal
They didn't love ya on the street and don't love ya now
They're out to make an end, friend
'Cause every dollar you make, they damn near make 10
They'll take you for everything you got
Or else they'll sign you and they put on the shelf to rot

I'm tryin to tell you what's up
You best to listen to this record even if you hate my fucking guts
'Cause I just can't stand around and watch rap get done
And my brothers ain't gettin' none

But it's all about the dollars when the day is through

[ Hot Dollar ]
(Cause the pimps don't get no bigger
Than these here niggas)

It's the return of the real

(These muthafuckas best to get to recognize
Before I gets to chastizin
Cause see, the shit all ties in
It's just some of that pimp, player, hustler shit
Ice-T been around for a while now
Nigga was gangbangin when gangbangin wasn't even cool, nigga
What you know about that shit?)

[ VERSE 2 ]
I go deep into the street life's anatomy
A nigga take me out - yo, what a upset that'd be
And if I fall I fall on cushions, ???
Hittin niggas up with the Tec and watch the blood gushin
I see your videos, a 100 niggas in it you don't know
Framed in the lens, bought friends
Who really got your back, nigga, check it out
You really possess like zero street clout (think about)
The only place you're safe is in the studio
Yellin in the mic, you'se a bitch, that's right
I take a nigga like you and make him prostitute cute
So what you got a gun, punk, you're scared to shoot
You front hardcore, but I don't feel ya
Kids from my hood'll take your punk ass and peel ya
Let me check my Rolex quick because time's money
Squintin from the Pavet face because it's kinda sunny
Skinnin the top back, flossin the rag and the thing
Feelin the sun, backin off of my pinky ring
Hittin the 'Shaw with my niggas and clown
Lift the ass, hit the switch, raise the front off the ground
But most of the time you can't see a nigga
Deep in the archives parlayin new ways to get my bank bigger

[ VERSE 1 ]
Saturday night in L.A., time to play
My peoples hummin like a vibrator, gotta make crime pay
I'm packin two gats and I wish I could carry more
Might sound crazy, but I ran out of slugs before
Yeah, I know the feds watch me
But my vest clashes hard with the Versace
So I'm just rollin in the black five hun'
I used to lowride, now it's just for fun
I had 5 cars, but now I got one
Hard to keep up ballin when you're on the run
I got two ki's in my trunk and a shovel
Stepped on the one, so now I gots double
The shovel's for drama, need I say more?
Got the fat stash spot under my passenger floor
That's for the other strap, the automatic type
I gotta keep it close in case shit gets hype
Got a bitch in jail, she didn't snitch, she did three
I'ma have to roll solo till they set her free
Cause I got some other crimeys down, true gees
But they got all day, so now it's just me
And I'ma kick this slang until the day I die
I can't go straight, I won't even try
I'm stuck in the game, so don't ask me why
It's life in L.A.

I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
Long Beach and Compton are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where the shit goes down

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now niggas like they credit and they like to get they loans on
So I hooked up with my boy who turns them phones on
He told me bout this nigga who won't pay
He also said he knew excactly where the muthafucka stay
So I went and got some homies I hang with
Some crazy muthafuckas who I used to bang with
We took a trip to his crib
I snatched his hoe and his kids, and this is what we did
I tied they punk ass up
I cracked the safe with an axe, and then the phones we cut
I didn't hurt his wife
But I promised next time that I would take her life
I shot a nigga in his neck for disrespect, caught a body
Got a murder in Miami for a shoot-out at a party
Got blood in my trunk from a punk who squealed
Had a partner tried to play me and his cap I peeled
Now I rest with my finger on my heater
Hand on my beeper, a light sleeper

I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
New York and Philly are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where my shit goes down

I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
Frisco and Oakland are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where my shit goes down

[ VERSE 3 ]
I use to sling enough water you could float a boat
You could ski on the mountains of fuckin coke
But now most niggas serve chronic
So I let em check the bank, and then I'm all up on it
I serve em with a cute hoe
In a week they tell my bitches 'bout all they dough
Then I jack and I kill
The jack's for the money, the kill's for thrills
I got 9'000 blacks that still serve crack
Got a bitch who works the Plaza too on the track
Got a GTA connection and I fence for jewels
Got some little kids that move my fuckin dope in schools
Got warrants for arrest in about 20 states
Got a bigger body count than fuckin Norman Bates
I'm a killer, jacker, dealer, pimp supreme
I'm livin out the hustler dream

I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
Houston and Atlanta are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where that shit goes down

[ VERSE 4 ]
Tonight I gotta meet this nigga from around the way
Some think he's cool, I think he's DEA
He said he want it bad, he heard that I got it good
I bagged up ten ki's of flour and met him in the hood
I met him at my spot, cause I know it's cool
Pat him down on sight to remove his tool
I made him name 10 niggas he should know
But that still ain't shit in the game of blow
He asked to see the dope, I asked to see the cash
He reached for that briefcase too fast
A fuckin pig, yo, he thought he had the chump
I had my nigga in the closet with a bull pump
And now there's fuckin shot-up body all on the floor
But that's what the shovel's for...

I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
Newark and Miami are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where my shit goes down

I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
Detroit and Chicago are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where that shit goes down

I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
D.C. and Cleveland are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where the shit goes down

I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
I know all my niggas live in down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where my shit goes down",Where the Shit Goes Down

It's 99 players check your game
Make sure them young boys respect your name 
Keep your heaters at close reach cocked and ready 
Cause the streets will catch you slipping, rock ya steady 
Watch your back with your homies that you feel is real
Your homeboys from your crew, yeah them the ones that do you 
The suckas that got the player hater venom
I want to take 'em outside and lay some slugs up in em

[King T]
When they need work
They call the cali drug expert
Smashing in a six hundred dollar bill burnt
Looking flossy living costly
Off the edge, out of state 
They gots to break bread, for sho 
I needs mo' ice drops for the lexo
Briggetts sets blow when I'm sipping the mo'
Freelancing, trying to build a mansion 
And stay faded
Have hoes walk around my crib butt naked... 

[Ice-T]
True, pop the remy kick back and let the players represent 
High floss true boss game and take aim
These sucka wannabe's
Nigga please - you're green
I'll bend hoes on the downlow - banks obscene 
want to chill with these niggas, bet you wish you could 
And suck game out my ass like sponges 
I run this 
You can't fuck with the steelo
You niggas want to be low
When I'm on the east I play ceelo 
Cash flow 
One track mind serial hustler 
Quick to break a buster ya snitch bitch? 
I'll dust ya 
Bentley ballin' bastard 
No hustler faster 
Game maker 
I knock a white bitch and break her

[King T]
But Ice, Chronic got me bruising my brain 
But soothing my pain, I'm true to the game
I got my mind made I gotta be that rich motherfucker
Set it up so my grandkids don't suffer 
The phat hummer 
The phat drummer - what's your choice? 
Trying to find a sister with a voice 
Make her moist 
I'm throwing up the W 
Bringing trouble to 
Those in sight
King T and Big Ice 

[Chorus:]
[Ice-T] 
But T that's trippin' and that ain't my sport
I'd rather lamp in my crib and flip the Robb report
And set my v-dozen on the streets
Bump my beats
Cause when I'm twisting my dubs
Can't nobody compete
Imagine this: 
A hundred G 'lex on your wrist 
Imagine this: 
About ten karrots on your fist
Imagine this: 
All dime hoes on your list
Ha - that shit would be nice
But your name ain't ""Ice"" - kid... 
I'll screw the silencer on - rock you softly
How you gonna step to me kid? You grew up off me 
TV, Movies, and Records and Tours
So many busters wearing Versace I don't wear it no more... 

[King T]
But this will be a classic 
Many facets to get that ass kicked 
The alcoholic Don, call me King Tragic 
Watch me speak the magic
Watch me teach that old habit - full of havoc 
And Ice'll tweak the mix when it statics
People pay
Just to have me stay 
And say a verse 
I'll freak a couple words unrehearsed 
Then I burst 
I mean I bust
From all angles 
Guarunteed platium on your single

[Ice-T]
Yo T, I really must admit I'm blessed 
Master V does some other shit TV's in the head rests 
Never wear no vests because I got mad love 
I catch respect when other niggas catch slugs 
1, 2 I bust shit to load guns to
Beats for the hoodlums 
Somebody's gotta do'em
Fed's screw 'em
Faggot's got my whole crib bugged 
Mad tapps on the phone cause I deal with the thugs 
Drugs? never
No, the Ice is too clever 
I'm overseas
Checkin G's
Nigga please 
Ballin' since the 70's - yeah baby 
Blew up in the 80's 
Now you niggas hate me
You can't see me motherfucker your focus is off
You can't be me motherfucker, you're broke and you're soft 
Too many niggas try to pert my lifestyle - romancing 
I was kickin game while them kids was breakdancing 
Overlord - so why the wack niggas ain't dead?
Probably because my aim is over nigga's heads/ 
East coast - west coast, I play the whole map and bounce/ 
They got a benz but live in their mom's house...

Player Haters fear it
Get you right up close near it

And niggas won't cross this line
suicide - and niggas won't cross this nine

puffin' with my niggas down south
what the fuck this really all about? man..
I'm coming out
front and back, 98 brougham
All you fake G's stay home
Leave that shit alone
King Tee's back on the throne
And that nigga on the mic - straight gone

Ice-T,"It starts like this 
Gats hit harder than fists 
Just cock and lick it 
The aftermath's wicked 
Brass gets evicted 
Another crew shot 
Can't put your strap back in your waist 
Cause your barrel's too hot 
You did it kid 
The more dead 
The more weight on your head 
Plus you ganked a suitcase 
Full of black tar H 
Baby boy, twenty keys 
Dead Colombian Gs 
Now you're ballin full speed 
One slip you bleed 
You had your nigga with you 
Hard rock street gorilla hitter 
He took a hot one in the shoulder 
Now he's bendin over 
Mad illegal 
Nigga flipped harder than Buggsy Segal 
He wet the room up with the rocket launchin 
Desert eagle 
Blood oozin through his black dickies 
Ya nigga say he's getting dizzy 
The car seat's fuckin getting sticky 
He leaned back, his whole chest plate's cracked 
You thought they hit him once 
He must of got double clapped 
Your niggas dyin but he ain't cryin 
Soldier no doubt 
He looked you dead in the eye 
Said ""get that money"" checked out 
Ballin bent him back in the black 
S T S but where he's going no stress 
Your niggas dead, but you're thinkin bout head 
Fly hoes and condos 
Once you flip the kilos 
The fact your niggas out ain't shit to ya 
More profit for your greedy ass 
No one to split the grip wit ya 

Chorus: 
Common sense will keep you safer than vests 
Ambulance, cots, cause real niggas give head shots 
LA streets will make your guts leak 
Player no doubt 
Young killers live for drug wars and shoot outs 

You flipped your chip 
Motorola, called your hooker 
Said you had a little foul up 
Told the ho to wet some towels up 
She didn't even talk 
Clicked the phone off 
Might a new some weak niggas 
But this bitch ain't soft 
Make your next call 
Straight to your chicano connect 
Said they would flip the boy for girl 
Up the weight, give you Peruvian flake 
You had to dump the body, 
Burned it beyond recognition 
Back back in commission 
Scooped your hooker, cleaned your seats off 
Squeezed off 
Two in her head 
Now the fuckin bitch is dead 
You're all alone just how you liked it 
Straight laced hustler from hell 
Street life you spiked it
It's time to hook up with the mexicanos 
Layin in the Dooly parking lot of a McDonalds 
Hit the corner they was there 
You're prepared 
Circled the block, screwed your silencer on 
Rock the esse they had 
Kickin back to get ya 
Crept on the dropped truck 
Double crossin ducks got bucked 
Check the back of the cab 
Suckas had the fuckin math 
Ten more keys of uncut pure cash (Yes!) 
Now your weighin thirty full keys 
Of girl and the pony 
Jumped for your lack 
Hit the yack threw your head back 
The big time is what you wanted 
And now you got it 
The devil put the strap in your palm 
And you shot it 

Chorus 

It's going down now 
On forever 
Square life is never 
Buck wildin is your life stylin 
Mashed out 
Hit a motel room 
Crashed out 
Called up a ho to get your dick sucked though 
Bad bitch phat backs green contacts 
Real hair, kept her feet all night in the air 
Kind of square 
Said she only worked the streets a week 
Said her boyfriend kicked her out 
And she needed to eat 
She cuddled to you like a baby 
Keep the girl mabey 
The pussy was tighter than fuck drove you crazy 
She kissed you on your chest and legs 
Asked you to fuck her in the ass 
Then she started to beg 
It kind of got you open, no doubt 
When baby doll fell asleep, with your dick in her mouth 
Now you're layin there, lookin at the motel door 
Hand on your strap, some beautiful whore 
You fuckin relaxed, fell a fuckin sleep bad move 
Big game take little game, show and prove 
Baby jumped up, went for the strap 
Dumped off 
Three shots in your face
Grabbed the sutcase 
Don't forget, grab the blow then jet 
Before that ho hit the door she sipped a glass of Moet 
Street life sabatoge 
Niggas want to live large 
Demon ho out for cheddar 
Capped you with your own Berreta

Chorus",Common Sense
Ice-T,"Yeah, This is Ice-T 
You've just been listening to the Seventh Deadly Sin 
To me the Seventh Deadly Sin is hardcore rap
And I'm very proud to have been a part of that throughout the years 
I'd like to send peace out to all my homeboys that kept it real
And love to all my niggas that have died out here 
In this bullshit that we call the streets 
You know? What can I say? Hip Hops been good to a nigga 
I got mad love for the East coast, West coast, North and South 
I got my niggas The Top Guns here
We gonna sign this one off like this:

My life's been a great story in the ultimate war
Should I ill or do right? Make peace or go raw? 
I can't explain the true penalties of fame and the wealth 
Tell me who can I trust? I can't trust myself
Got the devil got me thinking 'bout them ill moves 
Every damn kid on the street, they got something to prove 
Push a bullet through my heart, why not? That's a start
They could push their reps quicker, kill a well known nigga 
And if you say you're going to kill me, should I blast you first? 
Being black is kinda like being born with a curse 
Do or Die, that's the code of the streets I didn't invent 
Niggas sketch my life out with malicious intent
My skin color's got me trapped in a never ending ghetto 
I move to the hills, but I can never let go
The gun shots and the homicides just don't stop
And just because I came up, I can always drop

Yo.. we come prepared for guerilla warfare  
Never scared soldiers to the heart 
And hose them body parts with the hardwear
You spark a dun with Bizzaro or sequel
When you catch a link on the wings of this desert eagle 
Flappin, we splittin caps friend 
remember when niggas would shoot joints 
Now niggas be wildin' placing hollow points
Cause in this rat race, shit be moving at a murderous pace  
Mad sons got slugs to the face, OG packs kilos 
Over sore losers and cilo, prepare like a scout 
I hold the burner on the delo 
In this age of idolatry, mad niggas worship you vanity
If Five ?? you nigga maintain humanity - insanity 
Hope you see the light ­ like the prism's true colors
Only a few remain brothers, fuck the others
In this cold world ­ the war that's controlled by the trigger 
Revelation or the scripture got to be that live nigga 

So if niggas want to bite the sound like Tyson 
Deck him in the left eye, murder sit down like ryerson 
You want to dis, don't even try son 
Hey yo, Pizzone ­ I'm the prodigy you need to keep ya eyes on 
Yo who the don, who plays it all night long? 
50 mill strong, Handle like napalm. Word is bond 
Who get it on when it's time to drop a bomb? 
Sadq keep it cool and calm with the niapalm 
Droppin emcee's to their knees and make them pie straight 
Dust and take and serve niggas on my hot plate 
So cats who got beef, we can take it to the streets 
Cause shit these niggas talk to the grave with they teeth 
It's time to meet your maker step into the new millennium 
I analyze data like intel Pentium 
So follow me, I blame sovereignty for God we bust 
Top Gun, move bright, smooth as Ice, sex and dust 

Ante up the goods, Top Gun Ice-T in your neck of the woods 
I'm 15 blocks deep in the foreign neighborhood 
Street of my styles, no smiles, trying to gun down the golden child
Still on trial for my old endeavors
Cold weather got catched trying to buck wholes in my fucking sweater 
Niggas is soft like butter, leathers and felt 
Time to heat it up and melt
Felt the welts from brass belt buckles to brass knuckles 
Kill all the jokes and chuckles ­ let's all get together 
My fam stay thick together 
Trick off and lick off together
No matter the weather
Lets ease on down to the bow and to the bricks 
When I start to squeeze, I won't ease off a bit 
Won't be no teams up in here with no clashes 
Just bunk mile sleds boot shines up in the masses 

Life got no guarantees, I'm looking for the long lease 
When I'm in LA, it ain't hard to find me 
21st floor eating shrimp at Belonte's
Every time you see me I'm connected to a dime piece 
I check your styles, although you rhyme quicker 
No matter what you do, I'll always lace mine thicker 
Jealousy will make a fool die quicker than liquor 
Watch your back with your niggas 
Cause that's right where they'll stick ya 
You see me in the club jeweled up, all alone 
I give love to my homies, then I bounce the fuck home 
Bodyguards are something that I just don't do
Cause if I'm after you black, I'm gonna clap them too
Money makes all my homies look brand new 
I don't fuck with the fakes, I make moves with the true 
Ice ­ baby chopping that real, thought you knew 
I might sound hard, but nigga I can die too

Cause I'm as real as you",Exodus

It's just a fact that niggas ain't shit
Ain't shit like Egyptians, nigga trippin'
Beenie-eyed, never slippin', I'm grippin' the four-twenty
Motherfuck the bullshit talk - where the money?
Years ago, a friend of me ask me to start up a company
Duck Down's the name, rap music is the aim
Lyrically I bring the pain and lock the game with no padlock and chain
Some said that Buck went bust
But when I came out, I left 'em all in the dust
Look at your sound scam, original brown man
Makin' million everytime I drop a jam

[Ice-T]
Nigga duck, DJ drop the cut, huh
250 niggas throw they sets up
L.A. style, nigga what? (West Side!!)
If you've never seen it before they'll put a knot in your gut
Stand up, check your areas your group, your troops
These gang killers is real plus they, off the loot
Proceedin' to leave a nigga bleedin'
They love to fuck up in a frenzy, let fuckin' sharks feed me
Bitches start screamin' and stampedin'
Thank God it's evening, I didn't leave the burner in the B.M.
Where my nigga Buck, nobody seen him
Probably in the Eye Of The Storm where the ill perform, perform, perform...",Eye of the Storm

Yo, too many bitch-ass-niggas think they got a lot
And I'ma dead these wannabe heads with consecutive shots
Man, they smile up in you, griller want to give you a pen
Stick it to your crew like glue like they been down
Man listen, kill that bull with the fake-ass handshakes
You can slide by me with the rest of them damn snakes
Flakin' like paper while I'm takin' my life serious
You talkin' and playin', your whole antenna's mystevious
Claimin' that you got juice with an ultimate ??
But when the brother test you, murder and received no types of love
You think you got game, with that favour to your brain?
FUCK YA NAME!!! Stompin' the rut got yourself to blame
I represent Castor - bring it to you live
But cool and civilized, despise a nigga's livin' lies
No alibi's I see the weakness in your eyes dun
You want to run? Plus ya scared to shoot a gun for fun
You bust a couple of slugs off the rooftop
My team, come and touch ya somethin', make ya crew drop

I'm maxin' like a wiseguy
Know the John Gotti but I'm fuckin' up the body
Everytime my poet thug at a party
Ya want to step to T, go through JEL first
But remember where you see your homicide show rehearsed
Check 'em tag-times like they do with a pencil
No more solitary cause we mashin' in a Benzo
Next who gettin' hitters talkin' shit cause we bit 'em
Seven Deadly Sinner, problem-atic-rhyme-spitter
You a quitter - but I'ma bomb steady
If I was out of slugs, look out for Machette
from ear to ear homes, it's clear, you'll be bleedin'
Not me motherfucker lifestyles I've been devin'

Ice-T,"Ride as my jabos, cocked my straps watcha back
You know where you at? You in urban combat
So stay alert, use the attack of the tactical expert
Puttin' in work, and leavin' your troops with wet shirts
Your causality rate is high, I'm closin in
Prepare for your ultimate end, tell your family bye
Better cool like Egon, and shine like veegon
Pissin' on your beons, for decades and eons
You squad has no muscle plus you, my new hustle
Fuck scuffing up my knuckles, rather buck you and watch you buckle
I can't stand a snitch, a switch real bitch
I got some transcripts to say you been runnin ya lips
Now its on, on site, if I see you I'mma sin ya
If I catch you in traffic I'ma gift ya somethin' in ya
Letcha battle with death for the prize of life
I learned ta never come empty handed to a gun fight
My adversaries feel fright, his last sight
Was a flash of light, you said lightning could strike
From the same place twice, I have your head on my deat
Fifteen hundred, tonight's your last night gettin' blunted

The voices could not be stopped it began to morph
And reinvent them self I grew like a black blade
Moving like a tornado from the west to the east coast
Leaving behind a path of destruction and mayhem

Thick's ice fix ghosts infrared no remorse
And low from the exchange, psycho deranged
Playa lay no feel pain, killa coca main
I'm top framing the game, use muscle for the hustle
I zip duffel bags to muffle fags
Scuffle my knuckles bad on niggas that think that they running shit
They feel the punishment, uh, blood bath, the wrath
Aftermath, at least the guns in shit

Too under fallin charum leads to send up on the earth
Mix things with daughters with men
Since poured from birth the worth for the others
Go to war with my brothers
I'm unstable like Kane did to Abel
I'm out the stable sinning from the beginning
Leavin' daddy's little girl pretty linen bloody red
What's said in the book of dead is now all forgotten
My soul's rotten, still the blood's spilled I feel
Chills, I'm still plotting, I'm ill norm
Take life forms like light storms I laugh at the wrath
Of the guys comin on, visions of the antichrist is risen
The question is now, am I unforgiven?

Legends tells that the creator of this poison's name was ice
Although, others have told different stories, no matter
Who or what invented the monster, their souls would be forever
Damned to Hell

Enter the death chamber, cash richer, leave ya nutless
Cutless with the raw scope, double ya dope
Feel my back lash, body cash your whole fame and media
Greedy shit, tag ya out the rag Jag, speedy shit
Look in the sky, the four horsemen busting no discussion
No stopping its apocalypse, lock and load ya clips
Gonna be rich and dead, copa said don't matter cats scatter
Suckas get touched, niggas get rushed
Watch 'em transform into animal form, wicked hell born
Lord of the flies, cry and ya die
Mechanama come masses soul snatcher, fallen angel
All angles covered for you fucking God lovers
Possession, good suggestion run cuddle your funds
Double your guns, watch your kids grow, stay out my flow
Be wise, the magnificence, evidence, decadence mind
Seven sins, the abomination, I'm
That nigga, last nigga, street mack
Hot is my strap, wet is your back
Understand I never forgive, leaving bodies like sieve
Clap gats til my fuckin shit's clip less

From the east, west, north, and south, gangsta rap is now

A hard hit makes a soft ass, that's what they told me huh!
I'm totally gone, I'm in another zone nigga put me on this
We layin' stick, my lyrics is heat
Havin' visions of ritual mirrors inside my sleep - nigga peep
I remember watchin' the news, dead people in jimmy bag
I got a Nine nigga get me mad
And watch me throw up razorblades and get to trippin'
I'm cats and crippin', lickin' is civil like Jack the Ripper
I'm on a mission drippin'-a-fog
An when it sees a million motherfuckers deceased
some of police are brutal hog, I'm actor-baitin'
No hesitation to slice a motherfucker in thirty places
Fuck a case - ain't leavin' traces here to Redder-Dip
I'm aimin' a - automatic find a bitch I'm hangin' up
Protainin' up, boss strangler, better save my mother
Flat packs will end as brothers - the bloody covers
Bloody gloves like Yo-J, AK's my brainwaves
I'll strung a nigga all day to my dear play you won't be comin' back
I put that on my dear pops when I blast a fierce drop
My bloody mask revealin' Jason it's non-stop
The cemetery is what you facin'
My steel shot is smokin' like chainsaws, brains call
recommend that you get your homies and watch your motherfuckin' game fall

Prepare for the night that you never wanted
These streets is taunted, blacked out impala with the big rims on it
Hit'cha corner with the lights out, bitch it's on
Duck down wit'cha kids, you know what you did
Motherfuck what your niggas say, watch for the ricochet
it's gonna be hard to hear much, once my trigger spray
That's neither here nor there, just beware
Cause when I bust off my gat flings like a roll flair
You now listenin' to - the most hated and most loved at the same time 'cause
Ice nigga what the fuck you want to do about a T
Most'cha bitch niggas can't fuck with me
Cause your chin-chalked talk I can see through
Like you're rollin' in a phat V-12
Bulllshit - pull quick and have your shit cocked or dropped
Keep a spare clip cause sometimes the shots don't stop
It's motherfuckin' game to rap about, shits' for real
Double action, ain't gotta cock back no more
Got you bitch-ass niggas sweatin' like Taibo
Rather lookin', in my face, I'm just checkin' my flow
So, I advise you to keep it in the studio
Your attittude, you don't want to meet me dude
My crews' like a fuckin' wild bunch of escaped beasts
Like scientists, cross cells of apes and G's
All the war - get you battle gear, black fatigues
You talk shit, your crews' catch a casualty, uh!

Yo I be splashin' Street Wars
The hardcore Ambassador in a black four door Akaror, I attach yours
The Marquise piece, gold teeth and medallion
Heads I be sappin' like the grams I be baggin'
Fightin' women, cut throat and tree smokin'

Who's next on my hitlist when I rip this

droppin' hoes quicker than a syllable, yeah you killable
Your style, unfillable, wishin' my shit was stillable
I eel for the fuck of it, queen you know I'm lovin' it
Dick, never suckin' it unless I see a buck in it
You need the whip, cluck it kid, I'm furious
Leavin' your crew delirious so you don't take it serious
I'm guessin' you was serious about the West, none test
I got the rep for my niggas on the shaw
Got the ball, fuck the law and yep I wet 'em out
As I proceed to spread 'em out and dead 'em out
Spray 'em out, lay 'em out

Yeah I'm caught up to

Sometimes I sit and wonder
How many motherfuckers gonna die this summer
Gunshots from the hummer
Now the sawed-off riot pumps lead across your beds
They said: ""Mama, less you wouldn't strike back""
Mack ten, eleven, twelve, hit us and then puts us to hell
They started it, there's no way to mend it, we'll end it
My crew'll hit the mattresses, God

They stay up at nights waitin' on a combat call
Drinkin' hard liquor, smokin' mad loop and shit

I ain't mad at them though, they dumps the ammo
In you, suspend you in here, hell yeah
It's the time that the real niggas live for retaliation
Move on 'em, show, improve on 'em
All you punk bitches just stand back and watch

I gots no love, for them busters, who put the work in
I can still see my fuckin' boys' body jerkin'
I ran over to him, put my hand on his chest
Hole like an apple in the side of his neck
His eyes glanced up, his body jerked once more
There's nothin' else to do but to go to war
Slide the hollow-tips in the chrome four-four
Roll down the windows, hang the heat out the door
Catch all the fuckin' bodies that I can tonight
Double-back on your bitch crew, broad daylight

There's no innocence allowed in these ghetto streets
Grab your guns, buck 'em off, when ya hit your leak
Tell me what would you do if they killed your best friend?
Could you keep your cool, would the wounds mend?

Been packin' straps so long I gots some permanent bruise in my leg
Better that than dead
Now it's time to show you what I'm trained for in this
Rally up the wolf pack-attack relentless
Make ya understand it was the wrong crew ya fuck with
Now it's on bitches, guys are darker than shit
You musta not a known when you fuckin' hit that day
Or maybe you di, you're dyin' anyway
And not just you, some of your family
To tell you the truth any fuckin' body we see
You might just want to turn yourself into me
To save your hood pain of my crews' treachery
You fucked up, we know who you are, where ya live
We got your place ran up to a cop on the tick
We'll hit your block so hard, you'll swear it was an earthquake
Squeeze off the fully-auto, make your whole crib shake
I know you're breathin' hard, livin' on your last day
Or maybe, you're laughin', thinkin' that you got away
I don't give a fuck, I won't sleep
Till one of us lays me and my nigga 
That's the fear of these triggers
If ya smart, ya probably make a break out of state
We'll just snatch your kid, grab your fuckin' bitch and wait
I'll catch ya down South, lay your ass out straight
There's no where to run, it's time to meet your make
You got one chance, arm your whole damn crew

I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me

Can it be there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end not some crazy dream?

Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not so easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak

Tears they flow but why am I crying?
After all I am not afraid of dying
Don't believe that there is never an end

As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Someone calls from a cell, ""God be with you""
If there's a God then why has He let me die?

As I walk all my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul cos it's willing to fly away

Mark my words please believe my soul lives on
Please don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to see the truth

Iced Earth,"In July 1863
A nation torn in tragedy
A trick of fate, two great armies merge
Gods of war at Gettysburg
Devastation lies ahead
50,000 bodies litter the land
Hell rages three full days
The reaper sows, there's the devil to pay

The pressure's on and the reb's attack
The yanks must hold, They can't fall back
Just two brigades, 2000 strong
Against 20,000 they can't hold long

General Reynolds makes his way
Expect no mercy from the iron brigade
Until he shows they're on their own
But Buford's men have a will of stone

Bayonets gleam in the morning sun
Smoke and fire belching from their guns
Another volley and again they strike
Thousands more comin' down Chambersburg pike

This tragedy and what it brings
All the devastation
The reaper has his way
Men will kill, blood will spill
To preserve the nation
There's the devil to pay

South of town down the Emmitsburg road
The first corps are starting to show
For Buford's men, they're here just in time
The desperate need to strengthen the line

Bodies dropping the blue and the gray
Muskets fire and cannon blaze
The union fights defending the town
But they're outnumbered and losing ground

From the north and the west more rebels arrive
Thousands more and the fight multiplies
McPhearson's ridge and the black hats strike
A rebel sharpshooter takes Reynolds' life

This tragedy and what it brings
All the devastation
The reaper has his way
Men will kill, blood will spill
To preserve the nation
There's the devil to pay

Attack, attack, General Lee gives command
They're overwhelmed, the situation demands
The federals retreat and rush out of town
But they have fortified and saved the high ground

The day ends in victory for the south
Lee's as convinced as God's will is profound
They are invincible and their cause is just
But Longstreet is cautious and lacking in trust

Across the way the union digs in
The round tops, Cemetery Ridge and out to Culps Hill
Their lines are strong, no denying they'll stay
When the confederates strike
There'll be the devil to pay

I thought for sure they would break
But this attack that I have planned
A massive strike across open land
In the center they will break

We'll hit 'em hard, not a silent gun
Before the infantry's begun
Execute it well, we risk everything
It's in God's hands now""

""General Lee, I must tell you straight
I believe this attack will fail
No 15,000 men ever made
Will overtake that ridge today
A mile charge over open ground
With Yankee cannon gunnin' us down""

""We do our duty, we do what we must
And in my plan you will trust""

In wait behind the trees on Seminary Ridge

To the copse of trees)
For many of these men, they know it is their last

The slaughter now ensues
Bodies fall like rain
They valiantly pursue
Yet doomed to remain
At the double quick they charge
The canister rips through them
To the mouth of hell they march
Glory, the only gain

""We're almost there my boys
I've never served with finer
We must push forward boys
And bayonet the Yankee tyrants
To the copse of trees we charge
To crush the union center
And when they turn and run
An open road leads us to freedom""

""It's over now, we are retreating
I never thought that we'd be beaten
All this blood is on my hands
The thousands dead due to my plan
I am responsible, all of it is my fault
I thought us invincible

All this blood is on my hands

He must see it though

Coalition forms of many lands
Against Napoleon, West to east
Dogs of war will take to arms
And soon will be unleashed

All follow British lead
At the allies' helm is Wellington
Who must make his foe concede

Nations aligning against you
Marking your time Your reign is through
And you will see a 100 days

Soon you will be forced to see
Nations aligning against you
Marking your time Your reign is through
It lies before you, fate shall befall you

Near the Franco Belgain line
While 124,000 French
March there in double time

As the battle begins
Napoleon springs his audacious plan
He'll attack them on two fronts
Splitting up his warring band

As the Prussians sound retreat
Behind they leave 10,000 slain
Most of their force is still intact
And will live to fight again

Of 5,000 men
Would feel more under killing fire

To propel my nations might
For this I'll be remembered

If To the victor goes the spoils
I may die an impoverished man
For in the end irony
Has dealt the cruelest hand

The French force was swift and sure
But their attack would be repelled
And though the center batteed
The Anglo-Dutch line would be held

And as fate or skill would have it
And army moves in from the east
The Prussians, who slipped through his hands
Would soon spell his defeat

The French lines now are broken
And being open to attack
The emperor has no choice
And the old guard calls him back

Your kind refuse to hear
I am the light
I am the way
But the fallacies of man
Are easy to embrace

And though you fail to see
The truth is the path
That leads to me

Lays them to waste
I am the truth,
And I walk alone
Human hypocrisy
Exacting their fate

Are breeding fear
Inside your mind
And lies lead to disgrace
A failure to reform

Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five but I am still alive.

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide and with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed but I am living still.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around I will always be around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide and when I reach the other side

Hold on, hold on
Stay close tonight

You and I belong here
Two of a kind together
Day after day

Outside the night is warm
Just close you eyes now
So come on, don't you cry

Oh tonight somehow special
I don't know how to tell you
The way that I feel

We could stay here forever
Never come down
Won't you say that you will

No sense of direction its tough, baby, 
It's no party I said something I lost a connection 
And it's all I can do to forget about you 
Loving you is such a fascination 
'Cause I've loved you so long 
And my love is so strong 
But you know a certain party's missing 
I'll sit by the window 
Now you sit anywhere that you want to 
Sitting in the sunshine now we're hoping, 
As we're supposed to do 
If I get down on my knees 
Would you forgive me, please 
Its only that my heart is aching 
And it's all over you not a thing 
I can do little pieces of my world are falling, 
It's a good night 
""Goodnight, Mr. Matthews now, no talking  
The others are sleeping, there's always tomorrow""
Better come back soon '
'Cause I love only you 
No other will do
Loving you is such a fascination 
And I've told you before 
Only you know the score 
But you know a certain part is missing 
If I go down on my knees 
Would you forgive me, please 
It's only that my heart is breaking 
But it's a very temporary thing 
It just happens all the time 
Little pieces of my world are falling, 
It's a good night","Goodnight, Mr. Matthews"

No you never could hold me down
I've got to break these chains
It doesn't matter to me
Now I can leave it all behind
Well it's the anger in me
You put the anger in me
And I remember a time
You know it's not so long ago
I
Was always on the other side
And I knew there must be more
Hearing all your empty words
Your promises but now
I'm standing on the outside
Watching it all come down on you
I've got to break these chains
No you never could hold me down
I've got to break these chains
I've got to break these chains
So tell me where are you now
Now you know the way it feels
Was always easy for you
They never let you down before
I saw you turning to go
I saw you walk away from me
I
Was always on the other side
And I knew there must be more
Hearing all your empty words
Your promises but now
I'm standing on the outside
Watching it all come down on you
I've got to break these chains
No you never could hold me down
Break these chains
I've got to break these chains
No you never could hold me down
Break these chains
I've got to break these chains
Oh these chains
No you never could hold me down
No you never could hold me down
Break these chains
I've got to break these chains

Icehouse,"I'm playing my cards on the table no secrets, 
No sense of direction its tough, baby, 
It's no party I said something I lost a connection 
And it's all I can do to forget about you 

Loving you is such a fascination 
'Cause I've loved you so long 
And my love is so strong 
But you know a certain party's missing 

I'll sit by the window 
Now you sit anywhere that you want to 
Sitting in the sunshine now we're hoping, 
As we're supposed to do 

If I get down on my knees 
Would you forgive me, please 
It's only that my heart is aching 
And it's all over you not a thing 

I can do little pieces of my world are falling, 
It's a good night 
""Goodnight, Mr. Matthews, now, no talking
The others are sleeping, there's always tomorrow""

Better come back soon
'Cause I love only you 
No other will do
Loving you is such a fascination 

And I've told you before 
Only you know the score 
But you know a certain part is missing 
If I go down on my knees 

Would you forgive me, please 
It's only that my heart is breaking 
But it's a very temporary thing 
It just happens all the time 

Little pieces of my world are falling, 
It's a good night",Goodnight Mr Matthews

You wander alone
On your way down the same old road
Stand at the corner
Watch as the world goes by
Living on the outside you don't understand them
There's something that tells you
It isn't meant to be this way
Out in the wasteland
You have to face another day
Are you living in heaven or hell
Going over the line
On the limit and standing alone
Going over the line
Are you living in heaven or hell
Going over the line
Are you living in heaven or hell
Going over the line
On the limit and standing alone
Going over the line
You gaze out the window
Faces that pass by
Like yesterday's papers
The words have no meaning but
Is it any wonder that you look and don't see them
There's something that tells you
It isn't meant to be this way
Out in the wasteland
You have to face another day
Are you living in heaven or hell
Going over the line

Chasing the three blind mice

Simple Simon was not impressed
Down came the spider and sat down beside her
She wiped the smile right off his face

----------------------------

Where the moon sinks low in the southern sky
On the open plains, where the river runs dry
Well, his feet are bare, bare and dusty brown
And a hot wind blows over sacred ground

And a new day brekas
On the mountainside
Reaching out, reaching out
Over the great divide
It?s a long, long road
Stretching out ahead
Step by step, step by step
Over the great divide

On a dead end street in a border town
Where the stray dog sleeps in the midday sun
Now the headline news is old and worn
The pages stained with blood and rain,
And cheap red wine

And his skin is black
The last of his tribe
And he turns his back, turns his back
On the great divide
And a new day breaks
On the mountainside
Reaching out, reaching out
Over the great divide

Solid rock and burning sand
Weathered by the hand of time
Standing high above the storm
Cutting deep against the grain
And the years have come and gone
Leaving all their scars behind
Where the hills begin to climb
there's a legend carved in stone

And a new day breaks
On the mountainside
Reaching out, reaching out
Over the great divide
It?s a long, long road
Stretching out ahead
Step by step, step by step
Over the great divide
And his skin is black
The last of his tribe
And he turns his back, turns his back
On the great divide
It?s a long, long road
That leads him home again
Step by step, step by step

Well, you can see these people
At the end of every working day
Down at the local bar
Or maybe hanging out in some dark café
Down on the waterfront
As the big grey boats come steaming on home
It?s anybody?s guess
Where the night begins and the party ends

He says, ""come on, baby, take a hold of my hand
?cause it?s Saturday night in the Harbour Town
And the city lights up when the sun goes down
It?s Saturday night in the Harbour Town""

And anywhere you look
there's a smooth operator just playing the game
Got the blue jeans, baby,
His hands in his pockets and the same old lines
Looking for a good time
Waiting ?til the ship comes in

He says, ""come on, baby, take a hold of my hand
?cause it?s Saturday night in the Harbour Town
And the city lights up when the sun goes down

Where the punk who has the muscle
Is the leader of the local gang

And there ain't no time to waste
You just take him on single handed
You just push him, ?til it breaks

He said, ""hey, that's alright
I can take it for one more round
You can give me your best shot, baby
But the boy keeps knockin ?em down...""

So he grew up wild and reckless
And he grew up quick and mean
?til an enterprising gentleman
Put his talents in the ring
He said, ""boy, you're just a renegade
You got no place left to hide""
I can make you fame and fortune
Maybe champion of the world...""

You can give me your best shot, baby
But the boy keeps knockin ?em down...""

Well, there's blood on the canvas and leather
And he learned his lesson well
But the boy keeps swingin? those punches

Just as easy as you please
He was bound to do some damage

Well, the barmaid was an angel
And she looked so out of place
And she said her name was ""Sunset""

That the gunman was something special
And the bullet found a score

And that one mistake is ""Boy, you talk too tough""

In ev'ry town, on ev'ry street

Heartbreak Kid

Dirty rain soaked through the doorway
Of an upper west side bar
And the TV news was talking
To the crowd of people there

Sunset shot that gunman down""

Playing that same old song.

Her captain's ship, she waits for Wind and Sail 
 
Below the breaking point the tide will ebb and fall 
The storm is silent now, as silent as the dawn 
Above the rocks and cliffs she watches all the while

They bear the cross of coeuf de leon
Salvation for the mirror blind
But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear
Prayers they hide the saddest view
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And your prayers they break the sky in two
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
You pray til the break of dawn
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And you'll believe you're loving the alien
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

Palestine a modern problem
Bounty and your wealth in land
Terror in a best laid plan
Watching them come and go
Tomorrows and the yesterdays
Christians and the unbelievers
Hanging by the cross and nail

Making some sense
Where there`s no sense at all

No promises
But if you should fall

I could give you more
Than just the shape of things
Break every word
Begin it all again

Your name on a white sheet
Pure lace shot with passion
But as love lies
Bleeding in your hands

Heaven sends you
No promises
Of Arabian nights
No white waves on an ocean
No gems from a golden age

Life in your new world
Turning round and round
So make some sense
Where there`s no sense at all

I give you
No promises
But if you should fall
No promises
But if you should fall
You fall

No promises
But if you should fall
No promises
But if you should fall
You fall

Icehouse,"You're heard enough
Of the blues and stuff
You're pretty swell now
Cause you're pretty tough
But I don't have to tell you
How hard it can be to get by
You never bothered
About anyone else
You're well educated
With no common sense
But love, that's one thing
You really need to get by
All your troubles
Come from yourself
Nobody hurts you
They don't care
Just as long as you show them
A really good time
All the things
You used to do
A trip to the movies
A drink or two
They don't satisfy you
They don't tell you anything new
You know I don't talk much
Except to myself
Cause I've not much to say
And there's nobody else
Who's ready and willing
And able to know me, I guess
Listen to me
I'm not finished yet
There's something to tell you
That I can't forget
Just have a really good time
There's a girl
I used to know
Her face is her fortune
She's got a heart of gold
She never goes out much
But boy, when she does
Then you know
She's got no money
Well, maybe a dime
But she knows what she's worth
And that's reason why
She's gonna make it
She's got what it takes
You'll appreciate that
She's probably late
But I know
And you know
We all know
She'll have a really good time",Really Good Time

Couldn't even be stopped by Bin Laden
So September 11th marks the era forever
Of a revolutionary Jay Guevero
Now it's a whole museum of, Hov' MCers
Everybody duping the flow, you see 'em
Everybody looping up soul
It's like you trying to make ""The Blueprint 2"" before Hov'
Shout out to Just Bleezy and, Kan-yeezy
See how we adjusted the game so easy
Chicks barely dancing, glancing every chance they get
Like, oh shit, he's so handsome
Still in demand in the longest run standing
Kidnap rap seven years, no ransom
Can't one nigga get it back no rap
Young Hov's goin to Canton, I'm now eligible

Either haven't heard the album or they don't know English
They only know what the single is, and singled that out
To be the meaning of what he is about
And being I'm about my business, not mingling much
Running my mouth, that shit kept lingering
But no dummy, that's the shit I'm sprinkling
The album width to keep the registers ringing
In real life, I'm much more distinguished
I'm like a bloke from London, England
Yeah, you jingling baby
See I go right back and I bring 'em in baby
Business mind of a Ross Perot, but never lost my soul
Crossed the line, I bought pop across the row
Then I walk through the hood, where they up to no good

When I'm dippin on the grind I get my money quick
But sometimes I wanna lay up wit my honey dip
She be wit me cause she aint like all them other chicks
Let you hit, then she split, that's why I got a honey dip
From the club to the telly you know how it is
Most of the chicks I never tell em where a nigga live
Tryna reach me at my mansion or my mother crib
Hit my cell, hit my two, now I'm at my honey dips

Yo we talked about 8, said I was comin thru to hit
Now its wee hours in the mornin and I'm drunker than a bitch
Stumblin and shit, I jumped up in the whip
Flipped open the horn like where's my honey dip
And bitch fuck ya man tonite, you know my steelo
Sizzurp wit the Cristal, the corners playin cee-lo
You see me well you jus smile you know we on the le-low
I'm whippin thru the town like we boilin up a kilo
Huh, I'm tryna dip up in the tele
Dip up in the room, then dip up in her belly
Dip off on Pirelli's, Dip-Sets Fonzarelli
My white t-shirt, lookin dip up in my Pelle
Smokin weed up in the Range
Full speed left lane
Its me against the world, M.O.B. up in my vein
Wit another nigga girl, gettin low to give me brain
If the bitch about the cause you aint gotta spit no game

[Verse 2: Jr Writer]
You know I'm lookin for a honey dip
But I'm no dummy, most these bunnies
are money hungry and lookin for a money clip
So after the brother hit
I'll tell a honey dip
She won't see a contact, address nor buddy list
I aint on some hubby shit
That lovey dovey shit its nuttin trick I'm suttin slick you couldn't get
enough of it
How a slugger jus slide up thru the check in
Wit that linin on the Wesson
Hundred diamonds on my neck and wrist shit
I'm rich bitch, rhymings my profession
Watch how I do this stupid grindin and perfectin
Who's flyer when I step in got em spyin every second, cause that 06
Charger remind em of a 7
Yes man I'm so fresh the pro mess wit bread honey
My jeans 800, these are called Red Munkey
The flossin is gone, come talk to a Don fly enough to belong on a

I got me a lovely chick, I got me a slutty chick, I got em all, but my

She get drunk wit me, roll the piff up wit me
Throw singles at other hoes in the strip club wit me
She do anything for jus one quicky
She a nympho chick
For this slow dick
She give no lip, she jus go get
The paper I ask her for, my bitch so quick
Plus she know every Santana song and she don't mind puttin the damn bandana on
Slap her ass tell her dance in this thong
She do it all for daddy
She move it all for daddy...Aye Aye
She get a brick and she boof it all for daddy
Hit the road shake the State Troopers off for daddy
And she bring all that paper back
No short paper back, she sure don't play wit that

We found a way
To tie a bond between our hearts
In the open field should there we lay

Found a sharp stone, found a big tree
Found a clear space in the bark
Laughing louder chance a fine thing
Moving slowly off the mark

Out of season given reason
Could we see inclement weather?

Will you want me as I want you as you are?
The autumn is the finest time, the finest of them all
Will you need me as I need you as I did?
As I always should've done, tell me when we're there

Not too long and not too far
My dreams and I were wondering
If we harbor, if we labor
Sweet the fruit that fortune brings

Who will help us through these cold years?
Could I glimpse a rising sun?

Will you want me as I want you as you are?
The autumn is the finest time, the finest of them all
Will you need me as I need you as I did?
As I always should've done, tell me when we're there

Will you love me as I love you constantly?

Whatever we believe, whatever we believe

Take them under, take them over

The icy fingers clutch me,
With each motion that I hear,
Though dilligence caress me,

The distant bells are ringing,

Let me fill your cup,

Observe her wistful frown,
But her logic is a jungle,
Insecurity roams wild,
The laughter's ever present,
In the camp of the beguiled.

Leave your dreams where they are
They last a while that way
Save wasted time
Spend it
When you've nothing else to do
You've gotta get high to understand the blues

Hank Williams never came this way
You still can hear him sing
On the eight-track in the driver's cab
My tire-chain and my wedding ring
So come here little girl
Your body's soft and warm
She is a good wife
She's forgotten just how to treat her man

Chorus





",Truck Driver's Lament
Icicle Works,"I've been so lonely she can't understand the way I feel
I'm holding on, I'm walking home alone
I'm here without her
It seems that all the boys appreciate her
All the girls speak highly of her energy
D' you think that it could work for Jane and me 

[Chorus]
'Cos I still want her, I still remember summer
Way back when, we both felt the same
And I still love her, I can't stop thinking of her
I'm having trouble understanding Jane 

One by one my marbles left me
Jane would smile but never hold me
One night at the pool hall
Asked her if she'd hold my cue
Can't impress her with no fancy car
Resigned to lean here at the bar
I'll lose my mind
Shiver in responsibility 

[Chorus]",Understanding Jane
Icicle Works,"Traveling overseas I was accosted by a student
Who asked me where I came from, she was pretty
Children don't put smack in your veins
Lennon cut his teeth here
And the party-pooping left wing
Wouldn't play the Tories game
We're always in the market for an off-beat love affair
With a foreign delegation condescending for a share
Of a pressure cooker spouting steam
That threatens to unload
With a power so formidable
The Russian bear is in the woods somewhere

Television comedians united in approval
The drama that confronts you with real people in real times
I'm only in a band because I failed my own audition
You have to see somebody suffer other than yourself
Right now we're in a jam
We'll call you back when we get straight
'Cos Townsend's coming 'round
He understands, he won't be late
There's lots of food for thought
But not a great deal on our plate

Who can blame 'em seems we're always in the spotlight

We're always in the market for an off-beat love affair

Icicle Works,"(McNabb)

I see myself and where I'm standing in the scheme of things
I'm not afraid to say I might have lost my way
One thing I pray
These roots I'm growing won't be pulled up with the first ill wind
The future's riddled with uncertainty
I know that I'll be

Chorus:Walking with a mountain when I'm with you
Turning stones the downside up
You don't know what you'll find
Walking with a mountain when I'm with you
Goin' through our changes
Seems a strong love never dies
(Strong love never dies

Through my windows, down my street
The boys are meeting pretty girls
My leaving early doesn't mean I've found
A better place to go
Sometimes the finest things may fall short of their guarantee
The future's riddled with uncertainty
I know that I'll be

Chorus:

Don't look down I'm here beside you
Things don't look the way they used to
Makes no difference where you've been
Or where you plan to go...

Walking with a mountain when I'm with you






",Walking With a Mountain
Icicle Works,"(McNabb)

A different set of eyes for every story
A heaven not so far away from hell
A bittersweet reminder of the way things used to be
Before that love we had around us slipped and fell

Chorus: It's right there in your eyes
We can't go back the way we came
There's more to lose and less to gain
In dreams of yesterday
There's no surprise
You walk the wire you're bound to fall
You run to him and I recall
The time when you were mine
When you were mine

Now I may take a fast train
Burn all my credentials as I go
It's stranger than religion
It's a realm of indecision
It's the only place in town I want to go

Repeat Chorus At times like these don't disregard what's gone before
There's always something worthwhile knockin' on your door

Repeat Chorus







",When You Were Mine
Icicle Works,"(McNabb)

I'm not yet convinced that pride will come before a fall
I have seen you standing in your Sunday best and all
Waiting for a fool to take you further than you are
Given time you'll finish every heartache that you start

Chorus: Who do you want for your love
Better make up your mind 'cause time is passing
You'll be left behind
Who do you want for your love
Better make up your mind 'cause time is passing
Who do you want for your love

How can I deny that I would take you for my own
Love to play the loner till I find myself alone
Perhaps your indecision speaks of why I've tried for so long
Talk about you, sing about your brown eyes in a song

Repeat Chorus

Could you make that move embrace that certain moment
When you know you're on your own, lose those apron strings
Dance and sing
I know 'cause I've been there, let me tell you it's no party
When you're lost, count the cost, falling on someone is not the answer

Repeat Chorus






",Who Do You Want for Your Love?
Icicle Works,"Baby I can't win your favours
I can't gat you high
But I would love to taste your honey
Lick it let me try

Wanna suck you up inside
And lubricate your wheels
Jump on while my engine's running
See how good it feels

(Chorus)
Making love, always making love
Making love, always making love
Making love, making sweet love
Making love, always making love

I don't want you to love me
I don't want you to care
I don't want you to seek my heart
Just let me touch you there

Standing there all soft and sultry
Hands upon your hips
Let me come inside you baby
You've got so many lips

No, stop laughing, c'mon now honestly

The wings that they gave you
I know you felt the emptiness
Behind your empty words
Your silent screams confuse me
Behind the mask of pride there is nothing left
But empty words of loneliness
It's hard to select which wounds to heal and which to infect

And now you feel the pain is real
You've got no one else to blame
Don't let your rain fall down on me
Wish I was there to prove you wrong

It's been
A while since you pulled the plug on me
I tried to keep it together
Clenched tight as a fist
The harder I hold 
More fragile it gets
Everything you touched went up in flames
I doubt that I'll ever forgive you
The values that I once had
Don't seem to exist

You wanna play, just whisper in my ear and maybe

Hearts pumping, overheating
Girls, girls, live and breathe it
Hearts broke a million times, around

Girls, girls, wanna feel it
Never get enough, yeah

I lose control, I spin around in circles baby
And if I fall, I'll deal with that tomorrow, maybe

Twenty times, that's a good sign, like a four-leaf clover

And I saw all the ways that we've changed and the decisions that we made

Reading too much into every single sign
I can't face you with the others all around

I can't fix what's wrong

Such a lonely sound to try to get around
Imagine yourself as a little kid
In your parents arms and then it's gone
You step to the mic almost petrified
'cause everything you feel is in your eyes
You cannot hide but you're haunted
By the early frost
By the ones you've lost

Beauty shines so bright
Vanishes from sight
Wrap yourself in the night
Love with all your might

You can't shake this silence still
In your heart you're just not there

And you're moving above it
Stretching out in the sky
And your body is weightless
You're an acrobat
No one can deny it
Now we have to try to do all we can
To find you

Everyday is a world that you'd never choose to visit
No one wants to cry or say their goodbyes

I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues
Ida Cox,"I've always heard that haste makes waste
So I believe in takin' my time
The highest mountain can't be raced
It's something you must slowly climb
I want a slow and easy man
He needn't ever take the lead
'Cause I work on that long-time plan
And I ain't a-lookin' for no speed

I'm a one hour mama
So no one minute papa
Ain't the kind of man for me
Set your alarm clock papa
One hour, that's proper
Then love me like I like to be

I don't want no lame excuses
'Bout my lovin' bein' so good
That you couldn't wait no longer
Now I hope I'm understood

I'm a one hour mama
So no one minute papa
Ain't the kind of man for me

I can't stand no greenhorn lover
Like a rookie goin' to war
With a load of big artillery
But don't know what it's for

He's got to bring me a reference
With a great long pedigree
And must prove he's got endurance
Or he don't mean that to me

I don't like no crowin' rooster
What just kicks a lick or two
Action is the only booster
Of just what my man can do

I don't want no imitation
My requirements ain't no joke
'Cause I've got pure indignation
For a guy what's lost his stroke

I'm a one hour mama
So no one minute papa
Ain't the kind of man for me
Set your alarm clock papa
One hour, that's proper
Then love me like I like to be

I may want love for one hour
Then decide to make it two
Takes an hour before I get started
Maybe three 'fore I'm through

I'm a one hour mama
So no one minute papa
Ain't the kind of man for me",One Hour Mama (Breakdown)
Ida Cox,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.",Don't Blame Me
Ida Cox,"When you lose your money don't lose your mind
When you lose your money don't lose your mind
When you lose your good man please don't mess with mine

And I'm gonna buy me a bulldog to watch my man while he sleeps
I'm gonna buy me a bulldog to watch my man while he sleeps
Men are so doggone crooked, afraid he might make a four day creep

Girls I'm gonna tell you this, ain't gonna tell you nothin' else
Girls I'm gonna tell you this, ain't gonna tell you nothin' else
Any woman's a fool who thinks she's got a whole man by herself

But if you got a good man and don't want him taken away from you
Girls if you got a good man and don't want him taken away from you
Don't ever tell your friend woman what your man can do

Lord Lord I'm getting up in years
Lordy Lordy Lordy I'm getting up in years
But mama ain't too old to shift her gears

And I'm a big fat mama, got the meat shakin' on my bones
I'm a big fat mama, got the meat shakin' on my bones
And every time I shake, some skinny gal loses her home",Four Day Creep

You should capture my view

You can treat me like you please

Oh, drive away my heart tonight

Ida Maria,"You read about love in a book somewhere
Then you read it out loud what you found in there
And you had me for days and you had me for months
And I hope you've enjoyed your time of fun

Oh, forgive me
For running down your door
I thought all those fancy words were yours

I'm treated with cold, cold kisses
And I'm treasured like a piece of junk
I call you up to say I love you
You only call me when you're drunk
And still you keep me hanging around
Like I was some old sofa you fond in a second-hand store

Oh, forgive me
For running down your door
I thought all those fancy words were yours

I promise I won't do that anymore
I promise I won't do that anymore",Forgive Me
Ida Maria,"Twenty-two summers
And I hope you'll have a hundred more
Colors of this room will always follow

I hope we meet in the end
With wrinkles like the divas
And we'll dance again and again
In the end
In the end
Oh oh oh

Days and months and years
And cities people love and fear
May god wherever she's out drinking always be",In the End

Cause nicotine and coffee are my friends in this fight

And you, you keep me warm
You, you keep me warm
All your cigarettes and cup of coffee
It keeps me warm

Believe me I can play games 'cause I know all the rules
Believe me I can pretend 'cause I've studied the masks

But I don't wanna play any theater for you,
I don't wanna stage a single piece for you

Ida Maria,"God was there, always had the best of drugs
Knew where to get them
Brought a lady friend, and I believe her name was Stella, and he said 

Stella, Stella, I wanna give you the world, if just stay with me tonight
Stella, Stella, I wanna give you the world, if you just hold me tight

And I wonder how it will go
When God hands over the whole wide world to
A forty three year old hooker from downtown
Maybe it's about time the old man hands over the crown

Stella, Stella, I wanna give you the world if you just stay with me tonight
Stella, Stella, I wanna give you the world if you just hold me tight,
Hold me tight, hold me tight, hold me tight

And it made me realize, how much you wanna give away just to feel loved
And the Lord blinked to me and asked:
What is real love to you? What is fake and what is true?

Oh, Stella, Stella, I wanna give you the world if you just stay with me tonight
Stella, Stella, I wanna give you the world if you just hold me tight",Stella

You're loving lovely Lola
And kissing cutie Katie
And sexing sexy Sadie
I won't get in between ya
I'm not gonna Jolene ya now

When you pull the curtains down
That's the sign we agreed
For me to get out of town
But the northern winds are blowing hard
While someone's blowing you

Home sweet home ain't sweet anymore
I'm tired of sleeping on the bathroom floor
With ten thousand lovers and I'm one

I went to debaser
To watch Tegan and Sara
But they played so early
And I don't feel like dancing
And I don't feel like drinking
But I'm getting kind of hungry

The girl that served me the pizza
Said she also did ya
And the girl in line behind me
Said you've been behind her
I'm working hard to find a place in this town that
You've never been

Home sweet home ain't sweet anymore

Ida Maria,"You better believe in karma
Baby it's gonna sting
The wheel of life's gonna do you in
So I don't really have to do a thing
You took me outta my money
You messed up my love life and my career
You better believe in karma
Guess it's gonna start getting weird right here

Bad karma (oh, yeah)
Baby that's what you got
Bad karma (oh, yeah)
Whether you believe it or not
The universe is gonna getcha
You'll be scratchin' the seven year itch
You know what I think?
Bad karma's a bitch

You better believe in Jesus
'Cause only he can save you now
Throw in a saint or two why don't ya
Three hail mary's and a hare krishna
You made me drink the kool-aid
You tricked me into thikin' that Jill means Jack
You are the fire spawn of the Devil
But even he ain't takin' you back, back, back

[Chorus]

Bad karma (oh, yeah)
Baby that's what you got
Bad karma (oh, yeah)

Whether you believe it or not
The universe is gonna getcha
You'll be scratchin' the seven year itch
That's just my opinion
Damn! bad karma's a bitch

You better believe in karma
Just look at the sorry shape you're in
There's a doll with your name and your gloomy face
And the department up doing a rush on your case
You better believe in voodoo babe
I got a long list of your sins
There's a word you may have heard of
Called payback and I'm runnin' out of pins

I eat boys like you for breakfast
Where´s my salt ´n pepa now?
Oregano, basil and thyme and my Tapatio
I eat boys like you for breakfast

You've got a striking physique
Don't underestimate the hunter
Let's play hide and seek
You came to my island
You stepped on my lawn
You pissed off the dog too
You won´t last ´til dawn
You insulted my mother
Caught you groping my sister
You crapped on my father
Say your last prayers mister

I eat boys like you for breakfast
Where´s my knife and fork now?
Onions, tomeitos, tomatoes, poteitos potatoes

The rabbit was bragging of how fast he could run
Made a fool of the turtle chillin´in the sun
The race was on and the rabbit thought he won so he fell asleep
Now hear him weep
It´s your chance to repent for all the days you spent playing king of the hill
It´s an easy match but there is just one catch
By now you should know the drill
Yes you should know that

I eat boys like you for breakfast
Where´s my knife and for now?
Onions, tomeitos, tomatoes, poteitos potatoes
I eat boys like you for breakfast

Ida McBeth,"The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't 
disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so
The look of love

Let this be just the start of
So many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And baby we'll seal it with a kiss
