BBM,"You've heard it said, I taught the bird to fly.
One kiss from me and some can't say goodbye.
The place you'll find me when the sun goes down,
After hours, on the wrong side of town.
How many faces will I change today?
Take them to places where the shadows play.
That's where you'll find me when the sun goes down,
After hours, on the wrong side of town.
Lulled by the promise of a broken dream,
They all come looking for the answers.
The question's never if and when they fall from grace,
After all, it's just a matter of time.
Here comes another with a life to spare.
So young and innocent but I know that stare.
Just whistle Parker's Mood and I'll be there,
After hours, on the wrong side of town.
After hours, on the wrong side of town.
Stay away from the wrong side of town.",Wrong Side of Town
BBM,"The price is getting
Higher every day
When it comes to good loving
It's the same old way

The high cost of love
Getting higher every day
The less I get
The more I have to pay

I came home with the groceries
You said you need some more
I gave you my last two dollars
You said you need three or four

The high cost of love
Getting higher every day
Seems like the less I get
The more I have to pay

I bought you a leather coat
You said you wanted a mink
The way you spend my money
You think, you're married to a bank

The high cost of love
Getting higher every day
Seems like the less I make
The more I have to pay

Where I live they want
To raise my rent
Before I make a dollar
You know it's, it's already spent

The high cost of love
Getting higher every day
Seems like the less I get
The more I have to pay

Seems like the less I get
The more I have to pay
Seems like the less I get
The more I have to pay

BBMak,"Can you help me
Ease the pain
Can I hold you
Once again
 
You know that they often say that love is blind
My heart can't see
The reason why you left that love behind
Is hurting me
 
Is there a chance that we can be
Again
Again
 
Hold my head up, wipe the tears
I'm not crying for you no more

Baby when I found you,I just knew,I just knew
Couldn't live without you
Feel it too,do you feel it too
Everything you give to me
Feels as though it's meant to be
If you ever ask me how I feel

Now I'm thinking of you 
When I can't explain the feeling

BBMak,"What am I supposed to do with all these blues
Haunting me
Everywhere no matter what I do
Watching the candle flicker out in the evening glow
I can't let go 
When will the night be over

[Chorus]
I didn't mean to fall
In love with you
And baby there's a name 
For what you put me through
It isn't love
It's robbery
I'm sleeping with the ghost of you and me

Seen a lot of broken hearts go sailing by phantom ships
Lost as sea and one of them is mine
Raising my glass I sing a toast to the midnight sky
I wonder why the stars don't seem to guide me

[Chorus]

The ghost of you and me when will it set me free
I hear voices call following footsteps down the hall
Trying to save what's left of my heart and soul
Watching the candle flicker out in the evening glow
I can't let go when will the night be over

[Chorus: x2]",Ghost of You and Me
BBMak,"It's in the way you caress my face
Like you always used to
But differently
We can smile to hide the shame
Here in the pouring rain
Waiting for the sun
 
I'm crying all alone
Standing next to you
You have done your best to see it through
But, oh, baby
 
I can tell
By the way that you love me
Oh, I can tell
That the fire is burning out
Oh, baby, I can tell
By the way that you hold me
Oh, I can tell
That the fire is burning out
 
Moving down an open road
Asking our hearts for direction
Cause were so close
I can see the faded signs
Leading to the same destination
But you're not there
 
We're dancing to the music
That ended long ago
You've done everything that you can do
But, oh, baby

You know what I've been through 
Time helps, but it doesn't cure 
The scars will never heal 

Said your love was never ending 
But it slowly disappeared 
I know you want my heart 
But a friend is all I need 

'cause this love on the outside 
Is all I can give 
But this love on the inside 
Needs some place to live 
If I give you my heart 
Would you give it a home 
'cause this love on the outside 
Is love all alone 

I know that you love me 
Said a million times 
You know that it's hard for me 
Been told a million lies 

Said your love was never ending

I know you want my heart

BBMak,"I lie awake and die I try but I can't deny
That I can't make it without her
I can't forget the day I let her slip away
And I', still dreaming about her
Can a heart forget 'cause I just can't live without her

The next time you see my girl
Won't you say that I, I will Die, I would die to hold her
The next time you see my girl, won't you tell her I love her
The next time you see my girl

Maybe next time
I walk the streets at night see lovers passing by
And it's all a reminder
Of what it used to be when she was here with me
I only wish I could find her
Did she disappear 'cause I'm waiting right here for her

The next time you see my girl
Won't you say that I, I will Die, I would die to hold her
The next time you see my girl, won't you tell her I love her
The next time you see my girl

I close my eyes I see her face and I realize
But in front of me I had it all but I set her free
So next time you see my girl

And never get love
You'd better let love depart

I can't get you out of my heart

You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad

We pressed close to the moment
We were Siamese twins in ecstasy, in ecstasy

So we lay soul to soul as the archer of the night
United our hearts for our mutual delight
While the company derided me

Tie me up in your hair, I'm so easily led
Sink me deep in your oceans
Lock me up in your bedroom and lose the key
Oh, won't you lose that key?

Let me show you a sign pure as the virgin snow
Sail a while with me through my dreams
Hear the many enchanted themes
I will play for you in several keys of blue
Sing for you my swan song

Oh, strange, strange harmony
Oh, such a sad refrain
Feels like a thorn in the heart for me
Feels like I'm dying again

With our bodies on fire and our heads in a spin
We pressed close to the moment
We were Siamese twins in ecstasy

Let me give you the time to be your waterfall
We can bathe in the wine and the honey sublime
Till the last curtain call, till the curtain calls

Like the moon and the sun united as one
Like the nearly insane when the game is all done
We can't lose it all, we can't lose it all

Take me up for a ride, far from the stony ground
Glide the skies with me in my dreams
Hear the secrets of the themes
I will play for you in several shades of blue
Sing for you my swan song, swan song

All around his shoulders... 

And the church on the corner 
Marked the time for the mother 
Who was giving birth to a child across the hall... 

And I waited half in anger, half in sadness 
For an answer to the call for help 
I had written on the wall 

And the rain fell like jewels 
On the heads of all the fools 
Who wandered crazed with their souls ablaze for me... 

And the blessing of the hour 
Was the twilight and the tower 
With its golden bell form the bottom of the sea... 

And the moon through the window of the bedroom 
Where lovers slumbered 
Made a silver dance of such dust beneath the bed...

And the changing of their breath.

Be Bop Deluxe,"You came to watch the band
To see us play our parts
We hoped you'd lend an ear
You hope we dress like tarts
But back stage we stand naked

All the make-up cleaned away
My poet sheds his pretty skin
And turns to face the day
And there's nothing to be done
No nothing to be said

Last night I felt immortal
This morning I feel dead
And the love that gave
Its blaze to my heart
Now brings a haze

Be careful, I'm an axe victim
Hung up on these silver strings
Like wings, like time machines
Like voices on the winds
We hit the road to Hull

Sad amps and smashed guitars
Played badly at The Duke
To almost no applause
But someone made it worthwhile

When shining with bright eyes
They gave me full attention
And took me by surprise
But today the feeling's gone

No, faded like a ghost
Last night I saw the future
This morning there's no hope
And the words that I sung so clear
Are now clouded by my tears

Please, be careful, I'm an axe victim
Hung up on these silver strings
Like sails, like seagulls cries
Like church bells in the night

",Axe Victim
Be Bop Deluxe,"The stars are burning
And the moon is shining bright,
The world is turning underneath
This canopy of night...
Somewhere tomorrow warms the distance
With the light of dawn
You yawn, my love
Your eyes are growing tired
The dawn must come although we will deny it
I'd like to hold you here
Beneath these clouds of darkest blue
It could be a million years
Before the day comes creepin through,
But in the meantime
Let the moonshine shine
I'm fine my love, but tell me
How are you...?
You know that in the end it all comes true...
Heavenly homes are hard to find,
Heavenly thoughts in heavenly minds
Are not the world's design

Bea Arthur,"Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

",Where Do You Start?
Bea Arthur,"Who cares if the sky cares
To fall in the sea?
Who cares what banks fail in Yonkers,
Long as you've got a kiss that conquers?

Why should I care?
Life is one long jubilee,
So long as I care for you
And you care for me!","Who Cares?, song (from Of Thee I Sing, musical)"
Bea Arthur,"Move over, sun, and give me some sky
I got me some wings I'm eager to try
I may be unknown but wait till I've flown
You're gonna hear from me

Make me some room, you people up there
On top of the world, I'll meet you, I swear
I'm stakin' my claim, so remember my name
You're gonna hear from me

Fortune, smile on the road before me
I am fortune's child
Listen, world, you can't ignore me

I've got a song that longs to be played
Raise up my flag, begin my parade
Then watch the world over start comin' up Clover
That's how it's gonna be

What I have to do

Breaking rules and breaking free
Questioning the writing on the wall
Comin' from the underground
Laughing as we're falling down
Soaking in the glory of it all

When the sun don't shine we lose our minds
But I swear, we can get there

We've got young blood
Can't destroy us
We make our own luck in this world
We've got young blood
No one chose us
We make our own love in this world

Someday we could run away
See it all before the pictures fade
And bottle up the feeling in a jar
Pass around to all our friends
We could breathe it in all again
Huddled in the backseat of the car

But in dark times when we close our eyes
It's a nightmare, it's a nightmare
When the sun don't shine we lose our minds

I let you get too close
I know I should take cover, hide inside these four walls

Beanbag,"Stripped down and the ground is so damp
And the trees look around for the sunlight they mention.
Tears fall from the mildew of morning
So dust cannot live when it's placed in its hands by the ocean
It can dream of becoming glass like the sand.
Flames dance on the wall in the house that is dead
Scared of what it's becoming
As water laughs at the heat that's emitted
Now a flame cannot burn when it's starved of the air
That a human must breath in order to hear it's own lies.
See the place where I'm bound
We'll take these comforts so I may drown.
Dig out all my shame leave the dirt for the world to gain.
Rain falls like a bullet that's fired from a gun that is wet
'cause it's unprotected now
Rust forms in the barrel now.
You've had the chance but your mind is gone
And the rust erodes away under your skin.
Well I am on my hands and knees!

Beanbag,"Stand up
You've got to manage
I won't sympathize
Anymore

And if you complain once more, you'll meet an army of me

And if you complain once more, you'll meet an army of me

You're alright
There is nothing wrong
Self sufficient please
And get to work

And if you complain once more, you'll meet an army of me

And if you complain once more, you'll meet an army of me

You're on your own now
We won't save you
Your rescue squad
Is too exhausted

And if you complain once more, you'll meet an army of me

And if you complain once more, you'll meet an army of me

And if you complain once more, you'll meet an army of me

And if you complain once more, you'll meet an army of me

No vest section from my chest missin'
Die cause the jewels in my necklace glisten
In a V twizzy in a wreckless collision
Or die in the streets over somethin' petty
Cause a broke ass nigga tryed ta say I assed bet 'em
Die from a shot from a cig war glock

Too late, eight shots got my body nummin'
Die for fuckin' his bitch in his bed

Die wit a knife six inches in my head
I could die on death row, sentenced to the chair

I was high off vodka, hydro, and malt liquor
Die cause I knew I shoulda laid that man
Die cause the cops tricked me ta say that man
Die cause I hesitated ta spray that man
Die cause I hesitated ta pay that man
Die cause my man passed me a empty tool
Die cause I panicked, I couldn't keep my cool
Die cause I mixed all them pills wit Hennessy
Or die cause them niggas in jail, envied me
Die tryin' ta steal the fate of my enemy
I could go out from a case of mistaken identity
Or die cause the door wasn't open, it was locked
Die cause the 4 was broken, it wouldn't cock
Die cause a nigga wasn't focused on the block
Die cause them niggas thought tha coke was in the spot
Die cause another nigga said I said somethin'
Die cause that newsy bitch said I did somethin'
Die cause a nigga was tryin' ta get a name

Look at they face now! Stupid! All of them!
I'm not the second nobody , it's one me
I told you it was gon happen!
You can be that way if you want , it's me
Now look at they face! Look at them crawlin on they knees!
Sigel

[Beanie Mac]
Why niggas can't never just play they part
Gotta be the first ones that say they talk
Say they shared , first ones to say they did
Can't never be they self gotta play that kid
You know the same young buck you let touch the coke
And now that he come up he want to cut your throat
And you gave from the block , put em to your neck
Now he givin you a glock puttin it to your neck
You know that same bitch said don't fuck with him
That nigga no good ain't no trust in him
Two days later see her in a truck with him
Two years later now that bitch stuck with twins
That nigga been broke why now she fuck his friends
Got a lap dance in bars and touch them ends
Time uncovered a veil over people's plots
And the dumb shit they do to get on top

CHORUS: Nafeisa and Beanie Mac
Everybody wants to be a star
Everybody want to be a star , don't want to be who they are
Everybody wants to be a star
Every bitch want to hop in your car , every hater want to give you scars

[Beanie Mac]
Man every fucking day , these no flow niggas
Always in my face , with they promo niggas
I thought I told y'all , I don't know Jigga
I'm not Beanie Sigel , and I don't flow neither
What happened to your keys and dreams of being cracklords
Now it's Trinities , MP's and trackboards
I switched my hustle to get this cream
Now everybody and they mom want to spend $16
I got niggas wastin they change to get in this game
Like shit gon change when they get in this game
You think it's just rhymes and beats
Man this shit's stress time and heat , deadlines to meet
Everybody want to come cry to me , come spit they little lines to me
You shouldn't of lied to me , naw dog you can't rhyme wit me
Like you tied to me , like I don't see what you tryin na be

CHORUS (addition)
Stop tryin na be a star, be who you are
Maybe you will go a little far

[Beanie Mac]
Man I ain't gon lie I thought all the glitz was gold
And like Jay (I watched the truth unfold)
And now that I got a little time in with this rhymin
I found out everything that shine ain't a diamond
Everything that come in a jar ain't dro
ain't no use you spittin them bars you can't flow
ain't no use you gettin that are if it don't glow
And ain't no use you gettin a car if you can't go
Get out the streets , haters will draw you back
Like an automatic weapon that'll pull you back
Load somethin in the brain just to see you snap
I try to maintain but I see they trap
See they plot , you can see me not
You can be me not , niggas want to see me bopped , see me locked
See me in the block , send me shots , do anything to be on top

Sit you in a chair make your niggas call you short arm
Pellets in your hand You'll never put shorts on

This stick up shit I got it mastered
Glove and ski mask it

You can stop screamin' stop squermin' or stop breathin'
Cause I didn't come here to stay or play your babysitter 
I came here to split your mother fuckin wig nigga

Little suburb nigga never saw the streets
Silver spoon ass nigga never drawed your heat

God dam every week I got to break a jaw
And you wonder why I smack up niggas
Shit it's either that or Macs gonna clap up niggas

God damn somebody bring me some juice in here

I used to be a drug dealer
Hangin in the cut sellin' dime rocks
Gettin' cash to eat with 
Punchin' a time clock
In the ghetto makin' small change
Slingin' till the sun up
Got to pay my phone bill focusing on the come up
Got 6 shots numbers strait
Crank bout 38 
Big boys trippin' on me tryin' to nigga hate
This 17 year old Tony Montana type

Beanie Sigel,"This shit is not a fuckin game

Chorus 2X
Pac man, y'all niggas know my name
It'll take a quarter key to survive in my game
They call me Pac man, and ain't a damn thing change
Even though I got signed I'ma still slang thangs

Verse 1
Ay yo I cop power pellets (and y'all call 'em bricks)
I make little dots (and y'all chop rocks to flip)
Before junior, they had me out on a chase
Running from these ghost monsters y'all calling the jakes
All I do is stack loot
Run around and eat fruit
And harass these lady cops named Pinky and Sue
My whole life been a maze in a chase
Can't keep still without these monsters on my back invadin my space
I got two hitmen that'll bury you brothers
They rule the underworld
you know'em as the Mario brothers
Straight cannons 
And won't hesitate to shoot you
And they stay goin to war wit that latin King Koopa
I got a worker named Frogger
When I say jump he leap
A highway boy who be runin the streets
Wit that package
Dodgin through traffic that's narrow
And my nigga Donkey Kong bringin weed in by the barrels

Chorus 2X

Verse 2 (Missing Verse)

I take over blocks section by section
Shake under cover cops and make 'em change direction
They best bet is to relax and chill
Sonic couldn't catch me I'm good at track and field
I might run up in your spot
When I'm runnin' from the cops
Sling work a Dime a dot
A hundred a rock
I give out cooked 
Yeah But I only get raw
And I keep a nice stash in case I have a Pitfall
I got a worker named turtle that be movin my snow
He bring strait dough
He just move it too slow
I don't fuck with them crabs I had to blast those boys
I caught them breakin down my rocks like asteroids
Met ms. pac told she could go on a mission
But first she got to let me put in pole position
I wish I woulda knew then what I now know sooner
Cause 10 towns later here come pac Jr.

Chorus 2X

Verse 3

I got drugs for every race, color, and creed
I sling mushrooms to white boys in club Centipede
Donkey Kong was gettin money from slinging weed
I don't know why he want to start a pie factory
We can be partners
That's murda, us connecting
Wit the right blow 
And Burger Time doing the cheffin
We can get doe
Can't let the cops catch us
And if it move slow (still stack blocks like tetris)
Whoever don't want to get down, they stupid
Not the one to jump around these blocks like Q-bit
Ain't nobody out there making no noise
Wit they own route but that nigga Paper Boy
We can take his stuff
He ain't tough he a nut
He always letting Dig Dug pump em up
I pull a plug on 'em niggas if they don't want to set it 
Game over niggas, I'll see you next credit

Don't gotta buy a lotta drinks bitches know my aim
Y'all get them whores drunk just to get some brain
When the Roc in the place, they go berserk
We make em bounce till they motherfuckin' shoulders hurt
Bitches lift up skirts, take off shirts
Fine babysitters take off work
Lose they jobs, panties, shoes and bras
Niggas mad at us 'cause they lose they wives
I don't step up in the club without a weapon in the club
'Cause niggas get drunk and kick crap up in the club
That's why my tool be cocked, niggas mad 'cause my shoes be blocked
And my jewels be rocked
If you a playa, you wouldn't be in my pocket
If you a playa, you like it, you see it, you cop it

If you a playa, you got the three basic niggas
Your trick your lick and your dick niggas
The object never fall in love wit 'em
Run to the malls and the clubs for them
If you a playa, then you choose 'em like a playa
Use 'em like a playa,then you lose 'em like a playa
I bet I'll still be they favorite bitch
Some bought me ice, some paid for whips
C'mon you know the rules in this playa shit
Ain't no such thing as a relationship
If you a playa, get it now like a playa, get it down like a playa
Spit a round like a playa

Jiggaman ya heard?
If you a playa, will you pull up to the curb
Niggas chicks fly the coup when you pull up to them birds
Why the fuck would you bring her
When the rocks on that man got his whole hand lookin' like E-T's finger
If you a playa, keep your cars with the year (year)
Your watch game tight (tight) your hustle over there (uh-huh)
Your house outta sight, your enemies close
And your family tight and never try to make a ho your housewife

Only case we catching now would be a misdemeanor
Remember we used to hustle thinking life would cheat us
Not knowing if we struggled life would treat us
Think on how mommy carried us
Where life gon lead us
Knowing if we getting married
Our wife will need us
If at one time you could look into my mind
When I close my eyes and remember them times
No gas, had a hot plate heat our dinners
No cash, most nights ate sleep for dinner
Welfare and white landlord, that life ain't easy

Ain't no good times about dat there
Your boy rhyme now, it's fine now
We out dat there
Fuck that Access car
I'm-a work extra hard
To turn that into a platinum express car
You can have sweet dreams at night
Your boy ain't out there with dem toys and them pings at night
All dem cracks and the gats left that life alone
It's the tracks and the raps and the microphone
Wish y'all would fuck that up now
Shit it's all good now
We out the hood now

Livin' all days in doubt
Remember dem days
Thinking there's no way out
Remember dem days
Not knowing which way to route
It's all good now

Remember dem days
All the bluffs under the covers
Remember dem days
Heating up the house with the oven
Remember dem days

Aiyyo, from Boyz II Men to the End of the Road
Yo we boys to the end never been in the cold
You got me, I got you till our souls grow old
He shot you, he shot me, how we supposed to roll
I take a shot for my nigga gimme two to the ribs
Run a spot for my nigga, while you doin your bid
Fuck a step pop these see's gonna know who you is
I get it through to your wiz that it's due to the kids
For my dog, I swear to God I'll sit in a box
Gimme three hots and a cot before I snitch to the cops
Six foot ditch pam box covered with rocks
Tombstone ready die for the love of his block
Know what I want in my life I want for my brother
Know what I want for my wife I want for my mother
It ain't a question on what I would do for my squad
Ask yourself if you really true to your squad

CHORUS 2X
I'ma ride with my niggas
Die with my niggas
Get high with my niggas
Flip pies with my niggas
Till my body get hard, soul touch the sky
Till my number get called and God shut my eyes

[Beanie Mac]
We gon ride 95 till it ain't no gas
Flip and divide ties till it ain't no cash
And til the computers crash, and the dough on plastic
Everything in our path, go through and smash it
Put our niggas over bitches, niggas over riches
Niggas over drugs for my niggas I get slugs
I know my niggas thugs for my niggas I shed blood
My niggas y'all don't owe me shit, just show me love
I'ma get us out these streets, help our family eat
Move us out the hoods, put us in the Woods
Gimme just a second my flow ain't yet perfected
But damn when it is, shit then when it is
I speak the truth don't take this here as no song
Till I'm gray at the roots and my beard grow long
It's me and you ride or die let's weather the storm
Take on the world playboy whatever it's on

CHORUS 2X

[Beanie Mac]
I took bread with my niggas, spot rushed for funds
Took lead with my niggas, and we bust our guns
I shook feds with my niggas, knew where to duck and run
ain't care, where and when and who the fuck would come
We knew we'd ride till the day we die, till the day I fry
Told y'all till I touch the sky
We gon roll, gon flip, touch them pies
Know if I got the six you can touch the five
For my true block niggas I'ma spark for them
I get shot a million times lay in chalk for them
Gimme that 5 by 8 where it's dark and grim
I give anything to see my dog walk again
You can trust me with your wife, trust me with your kids
Trust me with your life, trust me where you live
Nobody know but me, you, and God

When it's beef people let them desert eagle speak
So whoever, wherever I don't care where we meet
Stop, chill, don't talk shit sideways outta your mouth
I will slap spit sideways outta your mouth
Bitch niggas talk indirect it don't matter
When you got snitch niggas right in your set
That's why I know where you niggas sling coke and pump D at
Same spot that you liable to see me at
Gun and a mask, one in the stash where the seed at
Stop, all my young bucks huggin the block
Stop puttin drugs in your sock
You makin it easy for the cops to catch you
They hooked to that stash and that trash and that bag of pretzels
You gotta hustle smarter than that
Cop coke harder than that, keep your dough apart from your crack
Keep a stash in the dark for the trap
Man you never know when the narks gon launch an attack

HOOK: repeat 2X

Stop, I know you cats livin a lie

Chill, I spit it for my niggas keepin it street
Keepin they steel, all my niggas keepin it real

You can shuffle up the cards I'ma learn the deck
When I do the game is mine, man I'm aimin high
Niggas talk about guns don't be carryin none
Every two hammers I cock I'm buryin one
I'ma dress in all stash this year, whenever I'm near
From the First Union, to Madison Square
Stop, chill, 'cause I know y'all niggas like Mac fuckin that track
Let me show you somethin dog it ain't nothin for Mac
It come all natural like I'm bustin my gat
Or I'm stuck in a spot crushin the crack
Got ice in a pot, fluffin the crack
Takin backs to the block so don't stuff in them packs
Doin life on the Roc ain't nothin fuckin with that
Me, jail, dog, you can put me under the ground
Where I'm from all my niggas they from under the ground
You can hear us when we come it's a thunderous sound
Trees, stompin, Roc jeans and a bunch of white T troopers
Stay on post with they toast and they like to shoot you

Fuck that, don't hold me back

I could go before your honor sit and peep my game

Stuck on this mission, go home, my girl fussin and bitchin
Motherfucker won't you change your life, I'm thinkin
Motherfucker won't I change my wife
Ignorant bastard laughin like fuck the rap shit
It's just another hustle, another way for niggas to touch you
Now they know the face of Beans
Now they, see my face on screens and I ain't even chase this dream
I feel sorry for those who did
y'all niggas can't stop the boar, whether rock or raw

See my face on cable, and have flashbacks of that cold ass table
And them hoes I gave you
I'm that nigga that'll come and pour salt in your wound
At the hospital, while the cops guardin your room
You gotta see what I've seen, look where I've looked
Touch what I've reached, and take what I've took
You gotta go where I've gone, walked where I've walked
To get where I'm at to speak what I've talked
You gotta lay where I've laid, stay where I've stayed
Play where I've played to make what I've made
You gotta move what I've moved, use what I used
Use tools how I use, use fools how I use

Niggas want to know if Beanie Sigel life is real
Nigga twenty-five ta life is real
I get a body, take me right ta jail
I know what it's like in hell
I did a stretch in a triflin' cell
What you know about twenty-three and one
Locked down all day, underground, neva seein' the sun
Vision stripped from you, neva seein' your son
You got bricks on the strip, neva see 'em get done
What you know about all day
Them Little Debbies and them Chi Chi's, they makin' you sick
You gotta wash out your drawers same water you shit
Brush, gargle, and spit same water you piss
You down wit this nigga, you done killed his brotha
But dog, don't think he don't know it
Think he a sucker 'cause he don't show it
Paybacks a muthafucka, and he won't blow it
What you know about them 4 letters, not the kind you write
Or the kind you sit down and type
Sign at the margin, get it right
I'm talkin' 'bout that real time
Life like Eddie or Martin
Ta my niggas, that's up the fort
When I get there fuck a pack, hand me a log
And a push rod toilet sword
So when I hit these niggas up they can't call the guards

What you know about solitary
Locked down, no commissary
And you wild or ready
And you just seen your mom get buried
You got drowns, comin' in all kinds of flurries
What you know about your towel on your cell when you alone at night
Or a jailhouse hunger srike
Or you sittin' in your cell and just zone one night 
And you think ""damn, I'm neva comin' home one night""
You got 5 years in, neva been flown a kite
You hearin' grown men moan at night
They got you stuck in the can
White man got you fuckin' your hand
Your wife on land fuckin' your man
What you know about no parole
Life in the hole
Lifes cold, you be eatin' them swags
Guards on the nightshift they be beatin' you bad
The hardest nigga turned bitch, be sleepin' wit fags
What you know about gettin' and shippin' balloons
Keep switchin' positions in the visitin' room
Gotta take Ex-Lax, hope you did it in time
Gotta shit in your palm just ta get the heroin
And you talkin' 'bout your life is this, your life is that 
Your life ain't shit, your life is whack

That left you grieving
Thanks for holdin' down the household when times was bad
As the man, I apologize for my dad

I'll probably die in the vocal booth spittin' out raw
Die on stage, rippin' down tours
Die from age, trickin' out-a-town whores
Die 'cause I didn't have one in the pipe
Might go out like Raymond, went out on his bike
And die on a death mission, two tec's spittin'
No vest section from my chest missin'

Die 'cause the jewels in my necklace glisten
In a V twizzy in a reckless collision
Or die in the streets over somethin' petty
'cause a broke ass nigga tried to say I assed bet 'em
Die from a shot from a cig war glock
From a kid on the block while sittin' in the drop
Or die 'cause I was on, ain't see 'em comin'
Too late, eight shots got my body nummin'

Die for fuckin' his bitch in his bed
Die 'cause a nigga thought I snitched to the feds
Die wit a knife six inches in my head
I could die on death row, sentenced to the chair
Or die 'cause a nigga pulled his Rosco out quicker
I was high off vodka, hydro, and malt liquor
Die 'cause I knew I shoulda laid that man
Die 'cause the cops tricked me to say that man

Die 'cause I hesitated to spray that man
Die 'cause I hesitated to pay that man
Die 'cause my man passed me a empty tool
Die 'cause I panicked, couldn't keep my cool
Die 'cause I mixed all them pills wit Hennessy
Or die 'cause them niggas in jail, envyed me
Die tryin' to steal the fate of my enemy
I could go out from a case of mistaken identity

Or die 'cause the door wasn't open, it was locked
Die 'cause the 4 was broken, it wouldn't cock
Die 'cause a nigga wasn't focused on the block
Die 'cause them niggas thought the coke was in the spot
Die 'cause another nigga said I said somethin'
Die 'cause that newsy bitch said I did somethin'
Die 'cause a nigga was tryin' to get a name
Or die 'cause it was just my time to feel the flame

Might get sparked, might not feel no pain
Might go out like dark-skinned Jermaine
Take a couple shots to the heart, to the brain
Got all the dough, don't know the cost of the game
Young buck didn't wanna come off the chain
Couldn't handle the rock, got horsed in the game
I could catch a bad break like Big or Pac

Beanie Sigel,"When I was five years old, I realized it was a road
But at the end, I ain't seen lots of pots of gold
I seen a long cell block, the box, the hold
Six hundred fenced in - some innocent, some rotten souls
Some men with men - stop it, whoa
I ain't runnin up in shit but a broad on her back
Tryin to cop a small hammer, move out like +Shawshank+
With +Redemptions+, I got my mind on revenges
They tryin to kill me at the same time keep me alive
I'm movin out like Adebisi on +Oz+
With my skully on tilt, two whacks in my palm
Posted up in the yard, everyday I think of pokin the guard
Throw a crack a nigga turnin me in
Tryin to crack a nigga turnin me thin
Food soakin in lard, news fools get opened in cards
With (?), in this prison life, what you livin like?

Can you tell me what that bed like, what's that cell like?
What's livin in hell like? Tell me do you eat right?
Do you even sleep right?
Yo, tell me what your life like
Tell me do you sleep nights, tell me what that life like?

On the block ready to POKE a face

You steal the deoderant out of CVS, you locked for retail theft
I got it body half a block stolen DT vest

6 30 In the morning, they kick your door in
Feds pour in, snatch you out your bed while you snorin
You unaware of what's goin on and
Come to find out, clients you had for years, turned to foreman
Told the law about the drops you make
How your clientele first started to escalate
Givin him keys to your crib, was your next mistake
At that dinner table, breakin out that extra plate
You can't turn a career addict off his coke habit
Put him on post with the toast that promote static
Back to the operation, they got you locked at the station
Fuck your back time, you worryin about what you facin
Heart racin, situation gettin scary
Old clients are showin up, at the preliminary
D.A. tryin to bury a nigga to Neveruary, 31st
God damn, that gotta hurt",What Your Life Like 2
Beanie Sigel,"You know my name, bitch
Uh yeah, hold up
The streets gave me heat, and the Eagle was the thing that they gave me
It's the rap guerilla that still clap, fucker
Yeah, guess who's back?

Mack, bitch, I move blocks and pounds
I move out with small blocks from towns
Move out with small glocks and pounds (uh-huh)
And I take everything to the table bag and rock it down
Fuck who watchin' now, the neighbors, they in pocket now
Fuck you haters cop some pocket now
When it come to coke you cant outwit me, mine cheap
Bout to take over the city of Philly like John Street
Nigga ask all y'all fiends, they call me Chef Boyar-Beans
Beanie Crocker, cook coke proper
Right amount of flour siffin' it up
Coke spots runnin' by the hour shiftin' it up
Graveyard shifts, move packs in bundles
Braveheart kids, use gats don't rumble
Gorilla niggas goin' ape in this concrete jungle
Banana clips'll make them monkeys humble

[Chorus]
Beanie! Sigel was the name that they gave me
Beanie! Sigel was the name that they gave me
Beanie, Beanie Sigel was the name that they gave me
Beanie! Yeah, but guess who back

It's Mack, bitch uh-huh, back in the mix or the scuffle
I'm in the hood with them chips like Ruffles
Boxman, Frito Lay, for that free dough boxin'
You will lay, nigga I'm not playin'
Listen, whether I make cash or take cash
I'm in the hood eatin' with my dog like when we break-fast
B's on the hood and the wheel and the brake pad
Shit when I skate past, bitches shake ass
I sit four-thirty deep in wheels
You bout, four-thirty cheap in wheels, small Benz
Look at your small rims, small wheel, small grill
Big Beans, sittin' in Bentley my heart peels
Zero to sixty so quickly how you want it? You can have it
Drop top, stick shift, automatic
Back wheels still smokin'
64 still rolling, 3 wheel motion, it's ferocious

[Chorus]

Mack, hey yo
On the low doe (shh!) the whole city is mine
I'm trying to flood the whole city with dimes (yeah)
I'm in the kitchen yeah, with that vision wear
Get them digits clear you can come and get them pigeons here
Niggas talk about the crack game slowed up, bullshit
You switch to hustle when the rap game showed up (uh-huh)
While you wastin' your time spittin' the rhymes
I'm gettin' mine spittin' them rhymes, but still pitchin' them dimes
And the spot still sick with da grime
Glock 26 nigga but I'm sicker than nine
I'm live with the pound, small silencer calmin' the sound
Stick with the seven, strickly smith with the seven (shit)
When I drop back and cock back
And pop that, I'm poppin' for keeps
I'm not gettin' stopped in the streets
Imagine that a nigga tryin' to rock Mack
Only nigga did it was Jay and he did it when I signed the contract

Fuck with that money paper then

Light as a rock, gonna light up the block
Don't believe in cases, goin all out
Paintin' faces, switch my picture, like tradin' places
For that money what?

Everybody hands up, or hands down money tucked
I flip the money trucks, money I don't give a fuck
Ay money, shut the fuck up
It's only a stickup

You don't stand a chance, give it quick up
You 'bout to turn into an ambulance pickup
Enough with the cocky stuff, fuck all that stocky stuff
Don't get smacked like a hockey puck

I ain't wit' that rocky stuff
I'm strapped got this gat (Blah blah blah blah)

I'm high off them cocktails
Dangerous gone broke, my aim is no joke
Duct taped, roped, strangle your folks

Prey on niggas in a circlular pattern
Catch you playin' craps, car in reverse

I'm circlin' back
Man I stay up in them dice games, fuck a ice chain
A Ice ring, I'm tryin' to come up on some nice change
Incase a nigga might swing, they gets a might thang

Pull out the right thang, show em it's a spike thang
Make you do the right thing, like a Spike Lee joint
Bang that pussy and his right knee joint
You get the sergeant and cap couldn't tell mack (freeze)

I'm like a rat dodgin' traps when it come to the cheeze
Backwards wrapped my trough

One nine clap crowns, and smack down niggas

Keep rope to hogtie you pork ass niggas
Stuffin' the boot to shoot hoops you sports ass nigga
Wouldn't shoot a game of pool
8-ball in the corner pocket, stop it

You niggas flippin' Guess jeans profit
Disrespectin' eskell, expectin' to sell
You got seeds in ya weed, disrespectin' the L
Don't got 20's on ya wheels disrespectin' the car

You burnin rubber and that squad, disrespectin the tar
You niggas wore ass backwards, 'vessinal gat

Drop the east the mack more vicious
Back to snatch or crack off dishes

Beanie Sigel,"I'm just a picture in a frame
man, I paint word pictures on the canvas of life
but I don't control the colors

Yo, I'm ten steps ahead of niggas, that shit scary
sometimes I feel ahead of myself
I hear this voice in the back of my mind
like ""Mac maintain, just grind, dog, better yourself""
So what I do?, I take heed and pick up the pace
can't explain it when I pick up my son & look at my face
I'm like a black rose growin' in the concrete crack in the pavement
there that voice go again ""Mac practice for greatness,
get paid for them immaculate statements""
Keep thinkin of them hotlines, like a physic, I can't explain it
There's no pen when I write it, there's nothing like it..

God damn, what you want from me, what you want me to tell you huh?
Niggas thought that I would stutter huh, thought I was dumb

But I ain't used to use my mind, I used to just... use my 9
and run wild with my boys, in the streets wild with these wars
now the Qu'ran and 48 laws, they polish my floors
I'm moving niggas like puppets with no strings attached
It's nothin' for Beans, so you know it ain't a thing for Mac
to look in your eyes, see through your heart, know what you fearin'
pick you apart, like you niggas is transparent
(I see right through you niggas)
It's like Mac was born with advanced parents
I'm like the Sun shining at night,
imagine it dog, I know you want to see me gradually fall
but I'm walkin on air, braking every gravity law
nothing like it...
I spit words that skip through air
let the words of a true thug hit your ear,
it change colors like blue blood when it hit the air
it's nothin' like it...

God damn, shit, I can't explain it
Fuck y'all niggas

I changed my whole life.. in about 9 months, just like sperm in a womb
these young niggas never learn 'til they doomed
try to tell them ""you can burn young punk, without smelling the fuse""
make you shiver in the middle of June,
paintin' pictures so vivid, you can hang it up in your room
shine bright like a prism, displaying colors like Crayola
think of the prisons with straight soldiers
think about the niggas who fucked us and played over us
think about the mothers who suffered and prayed over us
Just look at the the picture I've painted, it's so perfect
open your eyes motherfuckers, you can't duck us
no survivors every soul shall suffer,
I'm loadin them revolvers every shell shall touch ya
I promise I'll light your ass with these mags, I'ma bust ya
God damn it's nothin'  like it, I'm serious

can't explain how I write it..",Nothing Like It

Well I'm known to be the master in the M.C. field
Oh-oh got respect, oh-one I still
Tote guns to the show and then I jet wit a hoe
Bitch niggas want to front and get clapped
Get on the floor, clap a second time
And make sure I flat-line you
Let a whole round go, hit niggas behind you
See the gleam on the glock, know the beam on top
Get shot, popped, and drop, yo the team is the Roc
As I glance at Mack, a-k-a B-Sigel
Know we comin' with the macks and the extra Eagles

B-Sige, I put up all the roofs and glocks
I'm not playin, see these guns that I'm sprayin?
Twin sub oozies, can't budge or move me
Nickels stay chubby, smokers never choosy
Don't gotta yell up the block, they come to me
Packs with colorful tops just like coochies
New jacks with they pack they like, who he?
I'm not playin, knock them things off quick
Got game still think off shit
What you say?

[Bleek]
With a partner like Sigel, don't come a dime a dozen
We could be brothers, we better known as cousins
As we climbed the chart with who the fuck want what
My hood to your hood, we showed the world crew love
Who want to play with that Roc-A-team?
Know that I tote that thing that knock sixteen
You walk around talkin' this and that
How I sound like Jay and all my records is wack
But when I dropped the LP, niggas thought it would fold
Thirty days later, Coming of Age went gold
What you sayin?

[Sigel]
Now party people it's time for this question
No knock knock, who's that? who's there? or who is it?
It's the M-A-C-K
Yes the gun clapper, the duct tape, rope, black mask and kidnapper
The flow dope, the beats just blazin
Like Luther Vandrow says, yo 'I am so amazing and I've been waiting'
For a sucker to attack the cat with two gats
Yo Bleek, you got my back, show 'em how we do

Yo, I fight fire with fire, I make crews retire
I spit 9 to 5 nines, Bleek for hire
Your crew murderize, see the guns that I'm bringin
In an all out battle, Bleek come out swingin'
Memph the type of nigga that'll spit off quick
Biggs push the Benz and we spin off quick
Take a sip of the Cris pour the Belvy with lime
Crack the Arma del Lope and then I'm goin for mine

Shit the truth spoke, I gotta give the world true quotes
Can you feel it? I know the truth hurts
They say, ""How can he disrespect his pop with harsh curses?""
Simple - harsh life, harsh verses
""I can't believe the mouth of this prick
He said put his mouth on his dick,""
I know we gotta talk bout that, I know you salt bout that
You on the tip like I don't like you
I got four kids, three baby mothers, I'm just like you
Sometimes I wanted to just fight you, shit
Swing on you - think I'm playin man, I'm just like you
I was a kid with a puzzle
With missing pieces tryin to put it together dawg, you put it together
You made me have to foot through the weather
In the storm with no raincoat
I don't only speak on me, I speak upon the kids in the same boat
Ridin the same water, same situation
Same fatherless daughter - I hate you, that's in your mind
Don't get caught up in the rhyme
You think I dissed you now, that I don't miss you now
Don't be a hater now, be glad I made it now
I know I probably rubbed you the wrong way
But fuck what the song say, for the record, check it

[Chorus]
Still got love for you, though you left me in the cold
To face this world alone, and make it on my own
I still got love for you, but I just can't fight the pain
It's so hard not to hate, but you grow up in a way

Listen - that was my hurt in my heart talkin, along with the truth
I would thirst often as a youth cause of you the person
Moms nursing self-esteem issues
Round the house it's hard to find a clean tissue, minus her tears
To rewind this time I promise I minused my years
To the day to take the pain away
Seemed sunny outside, always rained on Jay
Pop you my umbrella, come help your son with the weather
Soon we come together like man and man and build
Play space, cards face up, I've come to deal
In order to get right we gotta deal with this wrong
And the pain I felt all my life you feel in the song
Your lack of warmth left a chill in the morn'
Your lack of love, left me loveless, and I'm of your breath
I'm your mind body and soul, your heart, your flesh
Your alcohol, your smoke, in results I'm a mess
And dad, still I love you no less dad
Hope you didn't think success would make me less mad
But not mad, just disappointed - we wasted years
I swear to God, may you take me away from here
If you taught me anything
The one thing you taught me is to face my fears, coward
How could you let me grow without you?
Grind in this rap game, take dough without you?
Wear my Pro Keds close to the sole without you?
Family pictures pose without you - WHY?!
Why shouldn't I be mad?
Monster's parents separated, Monster had his dad
These parents had they problems, he still came to the pad
He bought 'em new bikes, imagine what that felt like
Used to have to butt my head to go to sleep at night
Nigga you did me wrong but the love is strong, let's move on

[Chorus: x2]",Still Got Love for You
Beanie Sigel,"Beanie: Yeah, Sparks in here, the truth in here
Sparks: Yeah
Beanie: Yeah, witness, Tales of a hustler

Omillio Sparks, the young gun
My life as an adolescent, said I'll go through something
Other guys try to stand in my way like brick walls
So I kept guns in my palm like Messiah scripts in Psalms
I should fear no man but God
So, Lord knows we could get it on
Guns baptized guys testing my pride
Clearing my conscience in the liquor store
With a fifth of Thunderbird, but I be guzzling hard
Playing the corners with a washed-up old-head
Chant tunes by the Whispers
Same corner where I banged at with niggas
Cops drive by and grin on us
If they grabbed then 
One of them nosy neighbors done snitched on us (Again?)
Hey, this game juicy got me puffing loosies
Every two days interrogated by the police
See, this life I live cost more than your Roley's money
It cost my homey Nook his whole life, ya heard me?
When he was here, it was easy to love him like a brother
Now that's he's gone I find it difficult to talk to his mother
I mean, what do you say to a woman
That's just lost her only son to the game and the gun, except 
""Mami, I'm a ride for him.""?
The look that she gave me like, ""Sparks, you got some nerve.""
'Cause most of these niggas don't keep their words
Now I'm under pressure
And I can't even break that type of promise 
And y'all niggas paint that picture
Risking your freedom
On the strength of memories of him
The time he made you laugh
The time he bust his gat when them other niggas ran
How real is that?
Omillio Sparks, niggas, holla back

Tales of a hustler

[Chorus x 2]
In this life you not promised tomorrow
So take the bitter with the sweet and maintain
In these vicious streets
Carry your heat, and keep your mind on your money
Life's a gamble; everybody got a number, homey
Tales of a hustler!

[Beanie]
I'm back to the block with it
Wait, let me clear that up
I'm back to the blocks that you get when your block get it
Get hard with that hot water when the pot hit it
Get large with a little water when you pop wit' it
I send hope to late scramblers
Sling coke to you late you scramblers
Go broke, sling soap to you late night scramblers
No joke, I'm a crook; catch hooks broke; late night gamblers
Look, you loose limbs when fuck with him
That be I strapped and high
FBI all on back, want to trap the guy
Got niggas in all black want to snatch my pies
Never that, too many gats
Too many guns
Too many vests
Tough guys, not too many left
Where they at?
Dead or locked behind bars in jail
I know I ain't too far from hell
I'll spit the devil these bars in hell
Dog, I been through it, son
Look at my scars and tell
Catch Mac in a Chevy truck slightly tented
No excuses on who might be in it
You know passenger twisting backwoods
Slightly spinning
Crack the window, the indo slightly scented
Splash of haze and hash lightly blended
Put the pressure on niggas who might be timid
Like, you got like a minute
To put the cash in this bag or ya ass just might be in it
In small piece, I'll snatch your family up
Start from tall nephews to your small nieces
Bitches

Ice pinkie ring in the air, drinkin' my drink up
Top down, 'dro in the air, blowin' that stink up
It's seldom that I smoke, but it helps my thinker
Makes me a mathematician about my math
Get celebrity ass, I'm a statistician, rap with precision

Now divide yourself and slide

Mouthpiece for hustlers, ventriloquist for jugglers

Beanie Sigel,"c'mon let's try this Guru

When I was five years old, I realized it was a road
But at the end, I ain't seen lots of pots of gold
I seen a long cell block, the box, the hold
Six hundred fenced in, some innocent, some rotten souls
Some men with men, stop it, whoa
I ain't runnin' up in shit but a broad on her back
Tryin' to cop a small hammer, move out like Shawshank
with Redemptions, I got my mind on revenges
They tryin to kill me at the same time keep me alive
I'm movin' out like Adebisi on +Oz+
With my skully on tilt, two whacks in my palm
Posted up in the yard, everyday I think of pokin' the guard
Throw a crack a nigga turnin' me in
Tryin' to crack a nigga turnin' me thin
Food soakin' in lard, news fools get opened in cards
with ?, in this prison life, what you livin' like?

[Chorus]
Can you tell me what you live like?
Can you tell me what that bed like, what's that cell like?
What's livin' in hell like? Tell me do you eat right?
Do you even sleep right?
Yo, tell me what your life like
Tell me do you sleep nights, tell me what that life like?
Gettin' no kites like, no flicks like
Make you want to quit life

Them four letters is a motherfucker
That's forever like a motherfucker
Without a letter from a motherfucker?
It ain't even bout the cheddar from a motherfucker
Write a kite, some flicks from a motherfucker
Some drawers, some socks, some kicks from a motherfucker
I can't believe I'm doin' this bid for you motherfuckers
I'm down for another joker case
I was dealt this hand, and I'ma play it with my poker face
On the block ready to poke a face
I got an L goin' around with a smokin' case?
You steal the deodorant out of CVS, you locked for retail theft
I got it body half a block stolen DT vest
My rap sheet read three D abreast
Dangerous, duct tape daughters
I take to the street, like a duck take to water
Get your duck game in order
My bust game in order, I fluffs 'caine with water

[Chorus]

That's fucked up, you bout to take your longest trip
and can't do shit, but suck it up, be strong and shit
Handcuffed, ankle to wrist, in back of the bus
Flashbacks of you back in the world
Can't fuck now you thinkin' bout who in back of your girl
Got her ass up (kill this bitch) playin' your crib
Thinkin' bout who raisin your kids
Shit was all good a week ago, 'fore they came and raided your crib
6:30 in the morning, they kick your door in
Feds pour in, snatch you out your bed while you snorin'
You unaware of what's goin' on and
Come to find out, clients you had for years, turned to foreman
Told the law about the drops you make
How your clientele first started to escalate
Givin' him keys to your crib, was your next mistake
At that dinner table, breakin' out that extra plate
You can't turn a career addict off his coke habit
Put him on post with the toast that promote static
Back to the operation, they got you locked at the station
Fuck your back time, you worryin' about what you facin
Heart racin', situation gettin' scary
Old clients are showin' up, at the preliminary

Wit a confident swagger, international
Game so tight the girls had to go

Money too long, can't stash it
In the closet or the mattress
Paper, stretch like elastic
Checks from advances, the bank can't cash it

Searching for a glock in the pocket of his fashion
Bitches wit SP stitches on they asses
And they left breast (Yes!)

Three quarter croc, sharper than a pastor be
Sig bring the light to the masses
Of these rap bastards, who gives street passes
One shooting can lead to three caskets
Jump suits, state boots, at least three stabbings
You softer than a Reebok Classic

Keep a number on the high price lawyer

I still close my eyes, I still see visions

Still hear that voice in tha back of my mind
So what I do? I still take heathe, I still listen
I still paint that perfect picture
I still shine bright like a prism

My words still skippin' through air, I know you can't, don't, won't get it
You niggas chose to ride that shit, 'sault wit it?
I'm still afloat, I ain't tha captain of tha yacht
But I'm on a boat, I ain't actin' what I'm not, knowin' that I don't

You niggas actin' like you will
But I know you won't, you won't
I read between tha lines of ya eyes to ya brows
Ya handshake ain't matchin' ya smile, you niggas foul

I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can hear it in your voice
I can feel it in the air

I sit alone in my four cornered room starin' at hammers
Ready to go bananas
Two vests on me, two techs, extra clips on me
I know my mind ain't playin' tricks on me

I ain't skitz, hommie, ain't nobody drop a mick on me
It's like they tryna plot a set on me
I hear this voice in tha back of my mind
Like mack tighten up ya circle before they hurt you

Read they body language
85 percent communication non-verbal
85 percent swear they know you, 10 percent you know they stories
Man, tha other 5 time to show you, just know you

Then pull they strings, you tha puppet master
Fuck them other bastards, man, watch who you puffin' after
Play ya cards, go against all odds
Shoot for tha moon, if you miss you still amongst those stars

I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can hear it in your voice
I can feel it in the air

Can you feel it, can you feel it floatin'?
Foul picture quotin', scriptures from Revelation
Just talk shit an' got tha devil waitin'
Body get stiff, so levitate

Why do I speak blasphemy?
Knowin' one day that He'll ask for me
Ask for my sins, no one to feel His wrath for me
I go through it, so you wouldn't do it after me

As for me, I'm still circlin' tha block before I'm parkin'
Not bitchin', I'm just still cautious
Same black parka, same Uzi
Extra clips, still clappin' wit that same larkin'

Damn, I feel it in tha air, you not sincere
Nigga it ain't an us, or we, or I'ma thing
It's a good bad karma thing, this a song man
I'ma say, I swear I feel somethin' honestly

I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can hear it in your voice

I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can hear it in your voice

I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air",Feel It in the Air [CD-ROM Track]

About four or five just had to settle two
They said I try to show a nigga what the metal do
But didn't succeed the nigga still breath
Attempt please I would of hit him in his peas
With the Mac with the beam that got back in the breeze
Only clap from the neck up I'd let the heck-lar plug 'em
I don't think they made Kevlar scullys fuck it
I should of let the are touch him cuffed him
To the bumper drug him two city blocks
The juice in me and the henny shot
Four perks' and a ?hitter ock?

Lose the nurse some one get the doc'

When you look at the thing, give me the bling
Hand me the chain and the ring
Baller in the bubble, blowin bubble, always actin up
When trouble feel the double barrell of a double platnium thug
Clappin, ready for some action, and I'm going to empty the crib
I rep for the Roc and the State Property clique
Homey, you can't do shit
Throw a finger up, give me love, Remi in the club
When they see these thug, in a circle, snort the 50s up
Range Rov, 24 inch, blacked out bulbs
Blows fast, but hit your ho slow with the soul pole
Creeping on niggas trying to test me in the black drop top
Pull up and let the booper go bop, bop-bop
Treat you, in the wind, to my borough, blowin on my back

Beanie Sigel,"Honor, trust, respect
Devotion, friendship, loyalty
Karma, team, us, ROC
Solid, the evils, damn

With no union, and no benefits no dental plans
I can't eat off no hundred grand
I got cavities dat need fillin'
You can't feed a nigga Peanut Chews
Now put ya feet up in a nigga' shoes
A lack of green'll give a nigga blues
A sip of purple make a nigga rue
Make a drunk person speak a sober tune (I can't go on this way)
Fuck dat, I can't do it man
We make these tips off this gift that we cursed wit
But then my mind drift, am I defeatin' the purpose?
'Cause you feel like shit when you miss your son's first shit
But who gon' pay the bills? Supply the meals? No surplus
My baby mama give me drama on the daily
Like she making it barely and my kids is eating rarely (I can't go on this way)
I'm stressed out goin' through it I can't do it
If you put puppies in the oven, do that make 'em biscuits?
Put hungry dogs in the kitchen, will they eat the kittens?
Do you hear me, are you listening? It's a big difference
Do you catch the lines or the hooks or are you still fishin'?
These a couple questions that I need to be answered
Like is these Backwoods and weed givin' me cancer (I can't go on this way)
I'm stressed out goin' through it I can't do it
My momma say I got a nerve stress
Got her waking up in cold sweats
I'm hard-headed and iron
What make it worse my lil brother behind me
Blood pressure running like Harriet
She can't handle it
I got her screaming Lord Jesus like Mahalia
Son I'm tellin' ya please don't let me bury ya (I can't go on this way)
I'm stressed man, I'm goin' through it
I was taught trust in the Lord but still tie up your camel
Use your tongue as your sword and your books as your ammo
But when them bullets start flying and you got pussies around you
And who you rely on, got them niggas surround you? Shit
And make me feel like young Tinner, from the start I was finished
How a nigga start wit a finish and begin wit a endin' (I can't go on this way)
I'm stressed out, I can't take it no more
I'm moving ass backwards with no forward progress
Feel asthmatic like treadmill keep jogging
Stagnant, running in place is tragic
My heart in the faith I don't practice
I still pray Allah, forgive me for my actions
'Cause I spit gangsta, think Muslim, and act Kaffir (I can't go on this way)
I gotta still feel feed my youngin's, so keep huggin

I can't wait until the rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Stuck in one time, Free patrol the block
Get avoided by the government avoid the spot
Can't wait 'til rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Stuck in the box (I can't go on this way)

Straight from the ghetto
The ghetto I'm from the youngest be the ghettoest ones
Tryna make just as much as we could
Tryna make it but they gon make it hard as much as they could
That's why, that's why I hate 'em man
Them crackers ain't nothing without paper
They look at us it's nothing and uh (I can't go on this way)
Came too far and I ain't going backwardds for nothing
I ain't being distracted by nothing
Midget-size to Dikembe, I ain't backed up from nothing
Ma I'm still stressing
It ain't the kid it's the bills stressing, she hold it down on her own
She hold me down at the crib, hold me down while I'm gone
She held me down as a kid, hold me down while I'm grown (I can't go on this way)
I choose not, refuse not, down on my own
Now off the streets, runnin' wit the hottest label in the industry
The hottest label got a nigga lot of enemies
So now when I go in baseline
A nice-size ratchet to throw in wasteline
I gotta make mine
My bills ain't getting paid in, kids ain't situated (I can't go on this way)
Y'all better make a decision before us
'Cause the way that we living ain't all good
Ran away wit them hating ass niggas don't like us
Despite them, we gon' do it regardless
But all this commotion they causing, I ain't with it
(We ain't with it)
They can get it all it take is a call 'em
My dogs'll be down if the rounds gotta unlit it though (I can't go on this way)
Someday got to forget it though
Consequences for my sentence, got to forgive us though",I Can't Go on This Way
Beanie Sigel,"Bare witness to the greatest, can't beat us, join us
Keep heaters on us, wit red lasers
Now fair warning, sure shots won't graze ya
We hug corners, play blocks like Gators
With bundles on us, serve trays like waiters
It's the life we chose to hustle
Can't stop it, can't knock it
Half the profit get flown out Vegas
Me and my niggaz try an' break tables
Stack chips like Connect Four
While you prick's try and whip try and stretch more
Charge less for, that ain't the program
Get ya lessons from the snow man
Like Pillsbury I get the doe man
I'll off ya head for a slice of bread
I keep my word and I'm true to my peeps
Give me a bird and my crew gon' eat
I'm over the stove like +Cuban Links+
Breakin' down +Cash Money+ like +Baby+ do
You niggaz soft like baby food
'Round the world niggaz pay me dues
While you niggaz sing the same old song like Sadies do
Grown man nigga, baby who?

Old game like Grady fool
Propane flow flame you dudes
No name's don't claim ya shoes

Once again its on nigga, Sigel hard like corn liqour

Butt naked covered in blood, gaspin' for air
Clingin' for dear life, nigga you dead right

Nightmare (?) nigga
You scared 'cause I grew with Jigga
He said ""Sig' you that nigga,"" couldn't see his vision
But then he drew the picture, like a compository sketch
Yeah Sig' stay honest I'll deposit you a check
There's a secret society, all we ask is trust
No G money shit all we gots is us
True indeed, yes, more better, yes
More cheddar, S.P. chain, jeans and sweaters
Movies, cartoons, labels, etcetera
Fill in the blanks and drop blocks like tetris or
Get off the block, run south with M. Betha
From my block to your block, shout out to M Extra
Who the fuck (fuck) want (want) what (what)
None of you niggaz is Be Sig' word I'm done with you niggaz

Once again it's on, fuck it we ain't through wit niggaz
Twin towers here to ruin niggaz
You couldn't break up the towers with Tomjanovich
Or Osama bombin' shit
We slay niggaz wit K's, we the drama men
Get it right young scrap don't even try it boy (boy)
You rather slide down the razor blade slidin' board
I'm a live wire, hula hoop barb wire
Run through hell with gasoline draws on
You can't mute me put the pause on
My guns shoot like fast-foward's on
And dress cute when the war's off
What you doin' dawg, you playin' wit it
You make your bed right you layin' in it
You keep your ?share? tight you stayin' in it
You bringin' niggaz where your kids sleep
I sing to niggaz while the kids sleep
Rock-a-bye muthafucka
I hope you high muthafucka
Ready to die muthafucka

Kids who squash beef and run them streets

Once again it's on nigga, bring the drama to ya lawn nigga
Tell ya mama (?) get ready to mourn sista, it's a

You start off fast then you weezin' in the back
So even if I slack, I got enough lee-way
To put out The Reason by the Mac, Philadelphia Freeway
And I'm back, without leavin' I'm here, but you can't see him

No self convictions when I mention my intentions in verse

Help him wit his problems
And the bumps and grinds
And the evil things and thoughts that run through his mind
Take a hand on my sister j blige
As I listen to her life go down watchin her life spin round
On them records

Give her no drama let her rainy days be clear
Receivin' signs from Osama that the days is near
When babies is baby mommas man them days is here
It means that them days is now
I pray that the lord have mercy when my day come round

Taught you how to bust a fifth, shit
I taught you how to push a whip
Taught you how to suck a dick
Taught you how to fluff a brick
But you got more drama than a be, mama
Got me goin through the motions like C. Thomas
With the bullshit, he say she say
The bitch is mad cause my jams kick like Eastbay
Mad cause they mans got they kicks on replay
How you drop from celebrity status
Pushin' Bent to niggas in celebrity wagons
In them sucker type Jags
Now you fuckin' type mad

[Chorus]

[Young Chris]
Oh mommy its so sad
We had it together
You had it whenever
That's yo bad
You fucked up
It wasn't meant to be
You lucked up
Told me at the end don't trust her
See that's when all the bullshit started
That's what three me in reverse, counter-clockwise
In my mind I swore that we would work
But I guess that I was wrong
Ran into a dead end
Unfaithful bitch
You fucked the nigga I was blazin' with
Fugazied shit
It wasn't him it was the paper shit
Nowadays its all about the latest shit
That or they favorite...car
Or get paper from ball
Unless your label all that
And you labeled as stars
Makin' the millions
Got them bitches willin' to do
Whatever it takes
Takin' it off or willin' to screw
Whoever I bring
Guess it's a celebrity thing
But I was never ashamed
I was blessed with the game

So real that it feel, keep Cochran on my heels
Who rock the black and back out
Now the MAC back out, just bout to blackout
Got the ROC on my back, SP on my chain
Shooters on the block slinging P last name
Outta hot pink things like Camron Range

Yeah, slow all the way down young scrapper
Pump ya brakes real fast, before ya crash
Crack ya head on the dash
I put ya body in a cast, keep my shotty on blast
Hard heads don't get the picture until they see the flash
You ain't ballin', you pump faking
Till you found in ya trunk naked
Four pound to ya crown like, ""Where the paper?""

Stretch my middle finger to your honor

Try to forget me like all silence

I'm not about the threats B, I'm all promise
Before ""The Truth"", position in the booth
As a young scrap, I was vicious as a youth
Kept a gat moving pigeons in the Coupe
You was strapped, then positioned on the stoop
Stay strapped, put my pistol on shoot
Mac take ya ""Juice"" like Bishop on the roof
I had ya pissing in ya trunk like a roof
Bullets hit ya chest like a blunt rolled loose
I'm that corn liquor nigga, 100 proof
I bring the storm, all you niggas lace ya boots
Better yet, pull out ya strings, make a noose
Hang yaself, here's a deuce deuce, bang yaself like Cheddar Bob

I asked him what it was he said bun get ya weight up
This is lean, them white folks call it pearl methosine
Shit but we gonna probably drink dog cause that's what we be doin' to it
Now take this big red and pour about a 2 into it
I did 2's and 8's, what the fuck is you trippin' on?
He said man that's the ounces of cough syrup that you sippin' on
So shit I poured it I sipped it, then I sipped some mo
I fired up a green monster, and I hit that house
Started relaxin', shit and to my surprise
I was noddin' out lookin' at the back of my eyes
They tried to wake me up but shit I just kept yawnin'
I fell out of my chair and woke up there the next mornin'
God bless my nigga, cause its then I been spawned
On my white muddy go but cant taste a seed at all

Gun fully loaded like the Chrysler with the hemmy in it
I keep it ghetto like a 40 with the Henny in it
Went to school broke loafers on no pennies in it
Stood the coldest winter with the bummiest coat
Need food need shoes sold dummies of soap
Got tired of bein broke man life was a bitch
They bring you flowers when you head but no soup while you sick
So I switched my whole picture get involved with the bricks
Not the ones made of semen but the ones who sniffs
Tales of hustler, niggaz come for your jugular
If you sell one bag to they mother fuckin customers

Got every boulevard every street every ave
Got sneakers got clothes nigga you do the math
Push to hustle but the point is just to stack that cash

I need to place an ad with you today
No ma'am tomorrow may be too late

What's that, no this is personal
I'm not buying or selling anything
Yes ma'am, I know just what to say
I wrote it down, this is how it should read

Wanted one good hearted woman
To forgive imperfection in the man that she loved
Wanted just one chance to tell her
How much he still loves her
He can't be sorry enough

What's that, no that's all I want to say
I just hope these few lines will get to her
Yes ma'am, she means everything
I hope she comes back when she reads these words",Wanted (On the Run) [*]
Beanie Sigel,"My Spidey senses is tingling
Feel something God my radar is up


Something going on, I feel funny, can't tell me nothing's different
My nose twitchin, intuition setting in like Sti Vision
I still close my eyes, I still see visions
Still hear that voice in the back of my mind
So what I do, I still take heat, I still listen
I still paint that perfect picture
I still shine bright like a prism
My words still skippin through air
I know you can't don't won't get it
You square chose to ride that shit, sunk with it, I'm still afloat
I ain't the captain of the yacht but I'm on the boat
I ain't acting what I'm not knowing that I don't
You niggaz acting like you will but I know you won't
Man I read between the lines of the eyes of ya brows
Your handshake ain't matchin your smile

I can hear it in your voice

Ready to go bananas, two vests on me
Two uzis, extra clips on me
I know my mind ain't playin tricks on me
I ain't schitz homie
Ain't nobody dropped a mick on me
Its like they trying to pop a sick on me
I hear this voice in the back of my mind
Like Mack, tighten up your circle
Before they hurt you, read they body language
Eighty five percent communication non-verbal
Eighty five precent swear they know you
10% you know they stories
Man the other five, I'mma show you
Just know you been pulling strings
You the puppetmaster, them other bastards
Now watch who you puffin' after
Play your cards, go against all odds
Shoot for the moon, if you miss, you still amongst those stars

Can you feel the grim reaper floatin'?
Foul preachin quotin' scriptures from revelation
Talk shit and got devil waiting
Body getting stiff, soul levitation
Why do I speak blasphemy?
Knowing one day they will ask for me
Ask for my sins
No one will feel his wrath for me
I go through it so you wouldn't do it after me
As for me, I'm still circling the block before I'm parking
Not bitchin, I'm just still cautious
Same black parker
Same uzi, extra clip, still clappin' wit that same larkin'
Damn I feel an inner air you will not still here
There ain't an us or a we or I'm a thing
Its a good bad karma thing
Its a song and an honest thing
I swear I feel something honestly

Beanie Sigel,"I was sitting back, and I was thinking man
I ain't even trying to deal with this shit no more, you know
Cham' I don't know what to do yo, ya know
Seem like everytime a nigga make one step man
Nigga take two steps back, you feel me

They told me that pain was just in the frame, the irony of that
Cause that was the slogan showing, when they tried to see my tats
Never knew what was in the skin, would finally be a fact
Feeling like mother nature's, right behind me with a gat
Take that, the rain's loud on the window when it taps
To hell with the time, I thought that I could finally be relaxed
Tired of being po', yeah trying to leave the rats
Walk out to see three of your tires, that be on flat
And that one tire, left a sign of hope
That helps you to keep on grinding, when you kinda broke
That helps you to keep composure, up around your folk
That keeps from trying to wrap a rope, around your throat
Don't choke, you feeling like giving up
Life isn't a million bucks, you feeling like living sucks
God's telling you hear your boy, but you don't wanna give him trust
Mama telling you pay your tithes, and you yell at her back, ""for what""
So the pastor can ride faster, to get some rims on his truck
I don't think that they'll miss, ten percent of negative bucks
Put some Henny up in your cup, your problems will start to drown
But soon as your buzz leaves, then problems come back around damn

Keep your head up is what they telling me
, well it betta be
Sorry but the world keeps stressing me
Rain drops cloudin up the memories
It's gonna be alright is what they telling me
Don't let the stress get the best of me
Trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
Till my brain gets cloudy bout a memory

God knows, how I feel now
On the outside I'm smiling, but inside a nigga know he hell bound
It's a dark road, and I'm right here in the middle of it
Do I walk slow or if I run, am I'm missing some'ing
I took the time out, to save a little bread
Now my eyes, got water in em
Why the fuck am I still standing here, nobody love me I ain't happy here
My mama said, she can't handle him
But still, I'm looking at the bright side
But I view it through my other eye, cause it's a different color sky
Then the last one, my mind set on the prize that may never come
So do I try to stay alive, or do I grab a gun
End it all, put a stop to the pain
That goes on in my head, everytime it rains
But that was speaking, so you listening to the thoughts
Of an evil spirit, in demonic verses everytime I talk
I'm confused, by my psychological set backs
In the storm, washin out through the wet cracks
Looking for heaven, off in all the wrong places
I've given up so why the long faces? Let it rain

Your bills keep adding up, to be alone you prefer
Bill collectors steady calling, starting to get on your nerves
Your rent due on the first, but right now it's the third
Telling yourself it's gon get better, but ain't believing a word
Feel like it's hard to deal, tomorrow it's hard as steel
Not to mention the realest member, of your family is getting ill
Tell me it isn't so, tell me it isn't real
In the mist of all the drama, you take a lil' time to kneel
To deal you take a pill, just to deal with the drama
You thinking your life sinking, and there isn't a plumber
They tell you what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger
You'd have to be a Superman, to live as much as me partna
you're trying, but help is just what you dialing
Cause the room is a monsoon, that's never gon get to drying
The storm is moving on, and you thinking these people lying
They saying they had it worse, but how come they all keep on smiling

Don't let stress take control, gonna be alright I know
I'ma make it through fa sho, fa sho yeah - 2x

My memry, heeeey-heeey yeah
Stressing me-stressing me, my memories
That's what they telling me
I'm trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
By my memories, yeah heeey yeeeah

When it seems like nothing but dark clouds
Are raining in on your bright, sunny day
Remember, the sunlight always comes after the rain
You should be thankful, everyday
should be a celebration of life.",Da Rain

You said I never understand the pain or share the shame,

You took my love and now you celebrate.
When the morning comes, no I don't believe

by your school just yesterday.
I never meant for to cause you any pain

In the midnight midnight midnight

그대는 어떤가요 가끔은 나를 생각한 적 있나요
이 긴 밤에 다시 눈을 감고
그댈 생각하고 잠들지 못하고 그래요

조금 유난히 기네요 그대 없는 밤이
아쉬워지네요 그때 보낸 그 날이 더
계속 무뎌지겠죠 점점 잊혀지겠죠
언젠가는 그대가

잠이 오지 않는 밤 so sad at tonight
그대와 함께할 수 없는 이 밤
In the midnight, midnight

떠나가 버린 사랑 당신 you can’t do this to me
충분하다 충분해 그만 좀 해라 날 아프게
내게 미련이란 이름에 밤은 끝나지 않아

다 지난 얘기 다시 하고 싶진 않지만
내가 그댈 많이 좋아하긴 했나 봐요
계속 생각나겠죠 더 그리워지겠죠

그대가 없이 다시 맞는 이 밤
In the midnight, midnight
니가 없이 잠 못 드는 midnight

저기 반짝이는 little star 날 위로해주라
기댈 곳 하나 없이 쓰러지는 오늘 밤
저기 반짝이는 little star 날 위로해주라
기댈 곳 하나 없이 쓰러지는

별 헤는 밤 계절이 지나 조금씩 달라져가는 이 밤
하지만 난 여전히 난 잠 못 이룬 밤

다시 찾아온 이 밤 so sad tonight
그대가 없이 다시 맞는 이 밤
In the midnight, midnight

'Cause in the evening it's girls

I like the way that they walk
And it's chilly to hear them talk
And I can always make them smile
From White Castle to the Nile

Back in the day
There was this girl around the way
She liked by home-piece M.C.A.
He said he would not give her play
I asked him, please?, he said, you may
Her pants were tight and that's O.K.
If she would dance, I would D.J.
We took a walk down to the bay

I hope she'll say,
Hey me and you should hit the hay
I asked her out, she said, no way
I should of probably guessed their gay

I heard she moved real far away

Center stage on the mic
And we're puttin' it on wax
It's the new style

Four and three and two and one (What up!)
And when I'm on the mic the suckers run (Word!)
Down with Adrock and Mike D. and you ain't
And I got more juice than Picasso got paint
Got rhymes that are rough and rhymes that are slick
I'm not surprised you're on my dick

Be-E-A-S-T-I-E, what up Mike D.
Ah yeah, that's me
I got franks and pork and beans
Always bust the new routines
I get it, I got it, I know it's good
The rhymes I write, you wish you would

I'm never in training, my voice is not straining
People always biting and I'm sick of complaining
So I went into the locker room during classes
Went into your locker and I smashed your glasses
You're from Secausus, I'm from Manhattan
You're jealous of me because your girlfriend is cattin'

There it is
Kick it!

Father to many, married to none
And in case you're unaware I carry a gun
Stepped into the party, the place was over packed
Saw the kid that dissed my home boy and shot him in the back
I had to get a beeper 'cause my phone is tapped
You better keep your mouth shut 'cause I'm fully strapped
I got money in the bank, I can still get high
That's why your girlfriend thinks that I'm so fly
I've got money and juice, twin sisters in my bed
Their father had Aids so I shot him in the head
If I played guitar I'd be Jimmy Page
The girlie's I like are underage (Check it!)
Girls with boyfriends are the kinds I like
I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike
My father, he's jealous 'cause I'm making that green
I've got the girlie's numbers from the places I been

There it is
Kick it!

You wanna know why, because I'm
October 31st, that is my date of birth
I got to the party and you know what I did the Smurf
Taxing all females from coast to coast
And when I get my fill I'm chilly most
We rag-tag girlies back at the hotel
And then we all switch places when I ring the bell
I chill at White Castle 'cause it's the best
But I'm fly at Fat Burger when I way out west
K-I-N-G-A-D whammy
All the fly ladies are on my jammy
Went to the prom, wore the fly blue rental
Got six girlies in my Lincoln Continental
I met a girl at the party and she started to flirt
I told her some rhymes and she pulled up her skirt
Spent some bank, I got a high powered jumbo
Rolled up a wooly and I watched Colombo

Let me clear my throat
Kick it over here baby pop
And let all the fly skimmies
Feel the beat 
Hmm Drop

Coolin' on the corner on a hot summer day
Just me, my posse and M.C.A.
A lot of beer, a lot of girls and a lot of cursing
Twenty-two automatic on my person
Got my hand in my pocket and my finger's on the trigger
My posse's gettin' big and my posse's gettin' bigger
Some voices got treble, some voices got bass
We got the kind of voices that are in your face
Like the bun to the burger, like the burger to the bun
Like the cherry to the apple, to the peach to the plum
I'm the king of the Ave., and I'm the king of the block
I'm M.C.A., and I'm the King Adrock
I'm Mike D., I got all the fly juice
On the checkin' at the party on the forty deuce
Walking down the block with the fresh fly threads
Beastie Boys fly the biggest heads",The New Style
Beastie Boys,"Yes, yes, y'all and you don't stop
You keep it on and shockin' the place
Well I'm M.C.A. I got nothing to prove
Pay attention my intention is to bust a move
I drink quarts and cans and bottles and sixes
Between the turntables keep the vodka and the mixes
I'm Mike D. I got the deuces wild
A list of girlies numbers that I've dialed
I do the Smurf, the Popeye, and the Jerry Lewis
I like Bullwinkle but I don't like Brutus
I'm schoolin' in the boys' room coolin' by the locker
All the girls in class know that I'm the cool rocker
Punk in the hall man I should of oughta hit him
Had the fresh rhymes and the kid cold bite 'em
Smokin' in the boys room is what I do best
While you were at a party your girlfriend fessed
I keep a pistol in my pocket so you better be cautious
Fly around the world but it makes me nauseous
Mike D.'s day off everyday of the week
I got to the party and I did the freak
I got a girl in the Castle and one in the pagoda
You know I got rhymes like Abe Vigoda
I'm a Def Manhattan killer, a rhyme driller
A mic in my hand and a mouth full of Miller
I got a hat not a visor, I drink Budweiser
The turntables up on the drum riser
The needle's in the groove and the vinyl's on the platter
I know that I'm fly man there's no need to flatter
I travel around the globe, it's keeping girlies dizzy
My name's Mike D., now watch me get busy y'all

You're a fake wearin' sucker whose gold got rusted
Cheaper than a hot do with no mustard
You tried to steal my fresh and you got cold busted
Because your crew's all soft and I'm disgusted
I'm from downtown from the city of Manhattan
I got a lotta girlies and not one's cattin'
My posse's in effect and we're doin' the do
And we got more rhymes than your damn crew
Caught you poppin' that weak and you must of been dusted
Stuck you head in the toilet and stone cold flushed it
Word",Posse in Effect
Beastie Boys,"Well this girl came up to me, she says she's new in town
But the crew been said they seen her around
I thought they were right but I didn't want to know
The girlie was Def and she wanted to go
I think her name is Lucy but they all call Loose
I think I thought I seen her on eighth and forty-deuce
The next think she said, my place or yours?
Let's kick some bass behind closed doors!
We got into the cab, the cab driver said
He recognized my girlie from the back of her head
He said a little something about tip to base
So I made him stop the cab to get out of the place
I shouldn't have looked back man I'll always regret it
Something's going on and I'll probably never get it
She was crying like a baby, stupid dumb
It's just too bad that girl's a bum

She's crafty, she's gets around
She's crafty, she's always down
She's crafty, she's got a gripe
She's crafty, and she's just my type
She's crafty

I spent my last dollar to buy a Sabrett
When I seen this girl I could never forget
Now I like nothing better than a pretty girl smile
And I haven't seen a smile that pretty in a while
The girl came up to me she said she loved the show
Asked her to come home and she couldn't say, no
We got the crib, there's Adam and D.
We didn't say a word, they just stared at me
I said, I don't know her just met her tonight
And Adrock started hiding everything in sight
D. pulled me over said, hide your gold,
The girl is crafty like ice is cold!
The girl is crafty, she knows all the moves
I started playing records, she knew all the grooves
He thought she was a thief and D. was right
But I just figured she'd spend the night
When I woke up later in the afternoon
She had taken all the things from inside his room
I found myself naked in the middle of the floor
She had taken the bed and the chest of drawers

Because being bad news is what we're all about
We went to White Castle and we got thrown out
I got my boy Mike D., I got the King Adrock
I got the jammy with the ammo inside my sock
I shot homeboy but the bullet was a dud
So I reached in the Miller cooler, grabbed a cool Bud

Slow riding, gun hidin' on the go
I'm fly like an eagle and I drink Old Crow
I'm the king of the classroom, coolin' in the back
My teacher had beef so I gave her a smack
She chased me out of class she was strapped with a ruler
Went to the bathroom, rolled myself a wooler
With bottle in hand at the microphone stand
Ah yo homeboy, what you drinkin' man

I got money, I got juice
I got to the party and I got loose
I got rhythms, I got rhymes
I got the girlies with the Def behinds
I got ill, I got busted
I got dust and I got dusted
I got gold, I got funky
I got the new dance, they call the Brass Monkey

Because I'm hard hittin', always bitten, cool as hell
I got trees on my mirror so my car won't smell
Sittin' around the house, gettin' high and watchin' tube
And eating Colonel's chicken, drinkin' Heineken brew
And I'm a gangster, I'm a prankster, I'm the king of the Ave.

But I'm chiller with the Miller, cold coolin' at the bar
I can drink a quart of Monkey and still stand still

I ran to the fridge and pulled out an egg
Scoped him with my scopes he had no hair

He went for his to find he didn't have one
Put him in check correct with my egg gun

I egged the chicken then I ate his leg

With long brown hair
I took her to the place
I threw the mattress in her face
Took off her shirt
Took off her bra
Took off her pants
You know what I saw?

Right about now I'd like to dedicate this song out to my main homie Mike D
Get on the mic, g-get on the mic
Just get on the mic, get on the mic, Mike

Let's be real and don't cloud the issue
The rhymes are dope an M.C. you must listen to
People say that they been missin' me and missin' you
Get on the mic and let's show them like we used to
You say fuck that yo Holmes fuck this
I'm the king Ad-Whammy you're Dick Butkus
One-half science and another half soul
His name's Mike D. not Fat Morton Jelly Roll
Got busy in Frisco fooled around in Fresno
Got over on your girlie cause you know she never says no

J-just get on the mic, just get on the mic
G-get on the mic, get on the mic Mike

Well, Mike D. is a special individual
Pulling out knots and pulling in residuals
Go to the movies get the Rolos
The cholos riding slow and low
Mike on the mic and bust with the solo
Mike my stromie don't be so selfish
Get on the mic cause you know you eat shellfish

It's 4:00 a.m. I've got the Dr. Hfuhruhurr Ale
I've got nothing to lose so I'm pissin' on the third rail
Groggy eyed and fried I'm headed for the station
D-Train ride to Coney Island vacation
Dedicated to the boofers in the back of the 1 train
They'll be kicking out windows high on cocaine
And then I jump the turnstile I lost my last token
Ride between the cars pissing, smoking
Head for the last car fluorescent light blackout
Policeman told my homeboy ""yo put that crack out""
You know you light up when the lights go down
And then you read the New York Post Fulton St. downtown
Same faces every day but you don't know their names
Party people going places on the D-Train

Stop that train, I wanna get on

Check it
Trench-coat wingtip going to work
And you'll be pulling a train like Captain Kirk
Pickpocket gangsters paying their debts
I caught a bullet in the lung from Bernie Goetz
Overworked and underpaid staring at the floor
Prostitutes' spandex caught in the slide doors
Now you're tuck between the stations
And it seems like an eternity
Sweating like sardines in a flophouse fraternity
Fifty-dollar fine for disturbing the peace
The neck tortoise your Lees are creased
Hot cup of coffee and the donuts are Dunkin'
Friday night and Jamaica Queen's funkin'
Elevated platform never gonna conform
Riding over the diner where I always get my toast warm
Bust into the conductor's booth and busted out rhymes
Over the loud speaker about the hard times
Sat across from a man readin' El Diario
Riding the train down from El Barrio
Went from the station straight to Orange Julius
I brought a hot dog from who - George Drakoulias

M.C. for what I am and do
The A is for Adam and the lyrics, true
So as pray and hope and the message is sent
And I am living in the dreams that I have dreamt
Because I'm down with the three, the unstoppable three
Me and Adam and D. were born to M.C.
And my body and soul and mind are pure
Not polluted or diluted or damaged beyond cure
Just lyrics from I to you recited
Arrested, bailed but cuffed and indicted
Enter the arena as I take center stage
The lights set low and the night has come of age
Take the microphone in hand as that I am a professional
Speak my knowledge to the crowd and the ed. is special
For I am a bard but not the last one
I'm am the king and this is my castle
Dwell in realms of now but vidi those of the past
Seen a glimpse from ahead and I don't think it's gonna last
And you can bet your ass

I drop the L. when I'm skiing
I'm smoking and peaking
I put the skis on the roof almost every single weekend
Can't stop the mind-fuck when it's rolling along
Can't stop the smooth runnin' when the shit's running strong
Broke my bindings, the lion with wings
Preaching his word in the B. Boy sing
I am one with myself as I turn to thee
Prefer the dreams to reality
I prefer my life don't need no other man's wife
Don't need no crazy lifestyle with stress and strife
But it's good to have turn to be a king for a day
Or for a week, or for a year, or for a year and a day
Come what may

I'm fishing with my boat and I'm fishing for trout
Mix the Bass Ale with the Guinness Stout
Fishing for a line inside my brain
And looking out at the world through my window pane
Every day has many colors 'cause the glass is stained
Everything has changed but remains the same
So once again the mirror raised and I see myself as clear as day
And I am going to the limits of my ultimate destiny
Feeling as though somebody were testing me
He who sees the end from the beginning of time
Looking forward through all the ages
Is, was and always shall be
Check the prophetic sections of the pages

He's in line for the Disco Day

Hello Brooklyn

New York, New York, it's a hell of a town
You know the Bronx is up and I'm Brooklyn down
Because they don't know my name they only know my initials
Building bombs in the attic for elected officials
I quit my job, I cut my hair
You know I cut my boss 'cause I don't care
You tried to get slick, you bust a little chuckle
You're gonna get smacked with my gold-finger knuckle
'Cause being as fly as me is something you never thought of
You'll be sticking up old ladies with the hand gun or the sawed-off
I'm a Buffalo Soldier, broader than Broadway
Keep keepin' on I don't care what they say
I play my stereo loud it disturbs my neighbors
I want to enjoy the fruits of my labor
'Cause I am the holder of the 3-pack Bonanza
If you open the book then you will get your hand slapped
I am the keeper of the 3-pack Bonanza
If you ask a question you will get the answer
Her breast I saw I reached I felt
M-O-N-E-Y, the belt
I stay at home just like a hermit
I got the jammy but I don't got the permit
You know why?
You got a boyfriend and his name is Slick Nick
Annabelle caught with the shrimpy limp dick
I ride around town 'cause my ride is fly
I shot a man in Brooklyn
Just to watch him die

He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost
He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost
She's slippin' through his fingers as she's movin' out to the coast
He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost

Well if your world was all black and if your world was all white
Well then you wouldn't get much color out of life now right
Nicknamed Shamrock but my name is not Shamus
Girlies on the tippy cause my homie is famous
My name is not O'Houigheighi nor is it Brian
If I said that I was weak now, you know I'd be lyin'
Suckers try to bite they try to pursue it

You explain to a musician, they know it but they can't do it

I got Chinese eyes and Chinese suits
Smokin' much Buddha and smokin' much boots
More updated on the hip-hop lingo
My favorite New York Knick was Hawthorne Wingo
Met a girl at a party and I gave her my card
Man, you know that it said Napoleon Bonaparte
Peepin' out the colors I be buggin' on Cezanne
They call me Mike D Joe Blow the Lover Man
Your face turns red as your glass of wine
That you spilled on my lyrics as you wasted my time
You should be with me, you should drop that bum
'Cause I got more flavor than Fruit Striped Gum
With that big round butt of yours
I'd like to butter your muffin I'm not bluffin'
Serve you on a platter like Thanksgiving stuffin'

Here's another one for y'all to peep
It's called M-I-K-E on the M-I-C

I met this girl last night with a peculiar cackle
I laid the bait and then she took the tackle
Had too much to drink at the Red Lobster
Now the room is spinning around like the blades of a helicopter
I never met a girl that was too finicky
If the press has their way then they're going to finish me
You might know this but you've never been this see
If I ate spinach then I'd be called Spinach D
I shed light like cats shed fur
Ride around town like Raymond Burr
I'm so high that they call me Your Highness
So if you don't know me then pardon my shyness
I live in the Village wherever I go I walk to
I keep my friends around so I have someone to talk to
I play my music loud because you know it's got clout to it
It's a trip it's got a funky beat and I can bug out to it

Hit a motherfucker's face with the cue ball
Then I met this girl she tried to gank me

Possession is half the law

Your whole life is coming apart at the seams
You ain't nothing but a car thief biting routines
See, I'm a city slicker I ain't no townie
Right now I wish I had another hash brownie

Or Mookie's gonna kick your fuckin' ass
You try to take what isn't yours like a God damn rat
See, personally I wouldn't wanna go out like that

I'm a writer, a poet, a genius, I know it
I don't buy cheeba I grow it
People always trying to get next to me
I had a beautiful experience on ecstasy
I Smoked up a bag of elephant tranquilizer
Because I had to deal with a money-hungry miser
Had a 'caine-filled Kool with my man Rush Rush
Saw my teeth fall in the sink when I started to brush
You be doing nose candy on the Bowie coke mirror
My girl asked for some but I pretended not to hear her
You can't deny me, you always want to try me
Yo, you're just gonna get your ass kicked

Smoking that dust at St. Anthony's Feast

All the wife beaters and all the tax cheaters
Sitting in the White House pulling their peters
Buy my cheeba from the cop down the street
The only cop with a rope chain walking the beat
Like a sneaky pouch time bomb tickin'
Like the beat to my rhyme just kickin'
Space cake cookies I discover who I am
I'm a dusted old bummy hurdy-gurdy man
Five-O caught me now I'm going to the mountains
Said good-bye to my girl, my lawyers and accountants
My mind is kinda rhymin' and I think I oughta think
So I'm rockin' all the rhymes and I'll have another drink
So the lights are flashing, my mind is spinning
I feel like it is always the beginning
Of another rhyme I'm rapping, M.C-ing I rock

Sometimes drunk and he's always phoneless
Sleepin' on the street in a cardboard box
He's better off drinkin' than smokin' the rocks

He's covered with flies
He's got the hand me down Pumas and the tie dyes

Detox at the flop house no booze allowed
Remember the good old days with the rockabilly crowd
Memphis is where he's from
He lives in the street but he's no bum

Now rock, shocking the mike of the many times, times the times tables
Rock well to tell the spell all of the old fables

Sport the crazy funky threads that you've never even seen before

But now the sun is shinin', let's roll back the awnin'

This is a type of kinda like a formal dedication
Givin' out a shout
for much inspiration
All I ever really want to do is get nice
Get loose and goof a little slice of life
Sendin' out love to all corners of the land
I jump up on the stage and take the mic in my hand
I'm not playin' the roll, just being who I am
And if you try to dis me, I couldn't give a damn

Bass from the back of my car feels soothin'
Eight bazookas is what I'm usin'
I'm Mike D, and it's been proven

Those that are blessed say yes y'all

Tantalize my tummy with a booboo-snack
But now, I got to get back
Yeah, oh, this one's for you and you and you

Gonna break it down to the nitty grit
I'm gonna tell you motherfuckers why you ain't shit
'Cause suckers like you just make me strong

Gonna run to Joe and Tony's and get my hair cut nice
Yeah, yeah, real nice y'all

Well, come on y'all, and just come on y'all and just
Work-work-work-work it out, y'all

Beastie Boys,"Good morning
Time to get up and go to work

I ride on the bus into the city every day
I sit on my seat and I dream myself away
I dream I'm on an island with that foxy lady too
But when I awaken, I must be mistaken, I'm on Third Avenue
Won't you take me away and take away me
Won't you take me away and take away me, yeah",Mark on the Bus [Instrumental]
Beastie Boys,"If you can feel what I'm feeling then it's a musical masterpiece
Hear what I'm dealing with then that's cool at least
What's running through my mind comes through in my walk
True feelings are shown from the way that I talk and this is me, y'all
An M.C., y'all my name is M.C.A. and I still do what I please
And now I'd like to introduce (what's up?)
I'll pass the mic to D for a fistful of truth

The name is D, y'all, and I don't play
And I can rock a block party 'till your hair turns grey
(So, what you sayin'?) I explode on site
I'm like Jimmy Walker, I'm (dy-no-mite!)
And now I'd like to pass the mic
To Adrock, c'mon and do anything you like

I'm the A-D-R-O-C-K, in the place with the bass, I'm going all the way
I can't stop y'all, tock-tick, y'all
And if you think that you're slick you'll catch a brick y'all
'Cause I'ma turn it in and I'ma turn it out
But for now I've got to pass the mic to Yauch

Well, on and on and on and on
I can't stop, y'all, 'till' the early morn'
So rock-rock, y'all, tick-tock y'all, to the beat, y'all
To the beat, y'all, c'mon and rock, y'all

I give thanks for inspiration, it guides my mind along the way
A lot of people get jealous, they're talking about me
But that's just 'cause they haven't got a thing to say

Well, everybody rapping like it's a commercial
Actin' like life is a big commercial
So this is what I've got to say to you all
Be true to yourself and you will never fall
And now I'd like to pass the mic to the A

(So what's your name, yauch?) my name is M.C.A
I've been coming to where I am from the get-go
Find that I can groove with the beat when I let go
So put your worries on hold
Get up and groove with the rhythm in your soul
And now I'd like to pass the mic
To my brother Adrock, c'mon and shine like a light

Yes, yes, y'all and yes, yes, y'all
I'm always on time, nevertheless, y'all
And that's right, y'all
I shed light, y'all
I've got no time in my life to get uptight, y'all
So what you gonna say that I don't know already?
I'm like Clyde and I'm rockin' steady
But time flies when you're having fun, so Mike D (that's me!)
C'mon and get some

M-I-K-E to the D
You come and see me and you pay your fee
Do what I do professionally
To tell the truth I am exactly what I want to be
Now Adrock (huh?) and M.C.A (yeah?)
Let's rock this joint in the old school way

Well, I'm on 'till the crack of dawn
Mowing down M.C.'s like I'm mowing the lawn
I go off like nothing can phase me
You think we'll ever meet Stevie?
(One of these days, D!)
But I can stand my ground and I am down
To wax an M.C who acts like a clown
But for now, I'd like to ask you how
You like the feel of the bass in your face in the crowd?",Pass the Mic
Beastie Boys,"Yes, I got more bounce than the fucking bump
And then you want to know why because I'm motherfuckin' truckin'
I'm in the pocket just like Grady Tate
Got supplies of beats so you don't have to wait
'Cause I'm the master blaster, drinking up the shasta
My voice sounds sweet 'cause it has to (looking good!)
So light a match to my ass 'cause I'm blowin' up
I'd like to thank the people for just showin' up
But now I want y'all to move it
Put your point on the floor and just prove it
And I'm smurfin', not rehearsin', gettin' live, y'all
A little puffy, so you know what, I'm doin' right
'Cause that's the kind of frame of mind I'm in
I got this feelin' that it's back again
So don't touch me, 'cause I'm electric
And if you touch me, you'll get shocked

You got, you got, you got, you got, you got
You've got the boomin' system, but it's sloshing out doo-doo
You think it's chocolate milk, but it's watered down Yoo-hoo
I've been through many times in which I thought I might lose it
The only thing that saved me, has always been music
We've got our own studio, the Son of the G
It's no question, life's been good to me
'Cause life ain't nothing but a good groove
A good mixtape to put you in the right mood
This one goes out to my man, the Groove Merchant
Coming through with beats for which I've been searching
Like two sealed copies, of Expansions
I'm like Tom Vu with yachts and mansions
The logo I sport is the face of the monkey
Union made, Ben Davis-quality, it's no junk, see?
My chrome is shining, just like an icicle
I ride around town in my low-rider bicyle

So many wack emcees, you get the TV bozak
Ain't even gonna call out your names, 'cause you're so wack
And one big oaf, who's faker than plastic
A dictionary definition of the word spastic
You should have never started something that you couldn't finish
'Cause writin' rhymes to me is like Popeye to spinach
I'm bad ass, move ya' fat ass, 'cause you're wack, son
Dancing around like you think you're Janet Jackson
Thought you could walk on me to get some ground to walk on
I'll put the rug out under your ass as I talk on
I'll take you out like a sniper on a roof
Like an emcee at the fever in the DJ booth
With your headphones strapped, you're rockin' rewind/pause
Tryin' to figure out what you can do to go for yours
But like a pencil to a paper, I got more to come
One after another, you can all get some
So you better take your time, and meditate on your rhyme
'Cause your shit'll be stinkin' when I go for mine
And that's right, y'all, don't get uptight, y'all
You can't say shit because you're biting what I write, y'all
And that's wrong, y'all, over the long haul
You can't cut the mustard when you're fronting it all",Professor Booty
Beastie Boys,"Well, just plug me in just like I was Eddie Harris
You're eating crazy cheese like you would think I'm from Paris
You know I get fly, you think I get high
You know that I'm gone and I'm-a tell you all why

So tell me who are you dissing, maybe I'm missing
The reason that you're smilin' or wildin', so listen
In my head, I just want to take 'em down
Imagination set loose and I'm gonna shake 'em down

Let it flow like a mud-slide
When I get on, I like to ride and glide
I've got depth of perception in my text, y'all
I get props at my mention cause I vex, y'all

So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want? (what'cha want?)
I get so funny with my money that you flaunt
I said, ""Where'd you get your information from,"" huh?
You think that you can front when revelation comes?
(Yeah, you can't front on that)

Well they call me Mike D, the ever-loving man
I'm like Spoonie Gee, I'm the metropolitician
You scream and you holler, 'bout my Chevy Impala
But the sweat is getting wet around the ring around your collar

But like a dream I'm flowing without no stopping
Sweeter than a cherry pie with Reddi Whip topping
From mic-to-mic, kickin' it wall-to-wall
Well, I'll be calling out you people like a casting call

Ah, well, it's wack when you're jacked in the back of a ride
With your know, with your flow, when you're out getting by
Believe me, what you see is what you get
And you see me, I'm comin' off as you can bet

Well I think I'm losing my mind, this time

Said I think I'm losing my mind, this time
This time, I'm losing my mind

(Yeah, you can't front on that)

But little do you know about something that I talk about
I'm tired of driving, it's due time that I walkabout
But in the meantime, I'm wise to the demise
I've got eyes in the back of my head so I realize

Well, I'm Dr. Spock, I'm here to rock, y'all
I want you off the wall, if you're playing the wall
I said what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want? (what'cha want?)
I said what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want? (what'cha want?)

Y'all suckers write me checks and then they bounce
So I reach into my pocket for the fresh amount
See, I'm the long-leaner, Vincent the Cleaner
I'm the illest motherfucker from here to Gardena

Well, I'm as cool as a cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce
You've got the rhyme and reason, but got no cause
But if you're hot to trot, you think you're slicker than grease
I've got news for you crews, you'll be sucking like a leech

Yeah, you can't front on that

So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want? (what'cha want?)

Like a whirlpool spin beginning to unwind
And I stand at the edge cautiously awaiting
As time slips by
Carefully navigating by the stars in the sky
And I sit, and I think to myself
And on the horizon, the sun light begins to climb
And it seems like it's been so long since he shined
But I'm sure it was only yesterday

A cold chill of fear cut through me
I felt my heart contract
To my mind I brought the image of light
And I expanded out of it
My fear was just a shadow
And then a voice spoke in my head

Beastie Boys,"Get on the mic Mike let's be real and don't cloud the issue 
The rhymes are rope an M.C. you must listen to 
People say that they been missin' me and missin' you 
Get on the mic and let's show them like we used to 
You say fuck that I say fuck this 
The king Ad-Whammy has never been limp Dick Butkus 
One half science and the other half soul 
His name's Mike D. not Fat Morton Jelly Roll 
M.C. Busy Le Disco fooled around in Fresno 
Got over on your girl cause you know she never says no 
Well Mike D. is a special individual 
Pulling out knots pulling in residuals 
Go to the movies get the Rolos the cholos riding slow and low 
Mike on the mic and bust with the solo 
Mike my stromy don't be so selfish 
Get on the mic cause you know you eat shellfish",Get on the Mic
Beastie Boys,"Because I grab the microphone and I pick it up
And then I fuck it up and then I turn it in
And then I turn it out, got the body rockin' sound
And then you know I'm gonna get down and
Eat a Scooby snack and take disco nap
Because I'm shopping at sears, 'cause I don't buy at the gap
Sending this one out to all the funky inspirations
Pretty Purdie on the drums with the beat relations
Well, I'm working on rhymes, they're coming line by line
Trying to put what I feel into word and rhymes
I've got a feeling coming on, I've got to make some shit
A little something stupid, for the twisted and sick
Because I drive like a maniac on the streets
And I don't give fuck 'cause I've got the beats
Got my nuts swingin' from left to right and
Right to left and I'm death defying

I spin my fortune on a wheel like Sajak
Here's the payback keep going strong like since the way back
I try to be myself but I lose track
'Cause the shit gets complicated now I've got to get back
As we learn to breed love for one another
In these times of melding cultures
I give respect for what's been borrowed and lent
I know this music comes down from African descent
Because I don't need a magic potion
Let me talk about back field in motion
My girls got cheeks for weeks and I'm happy
You know I'm a sneak like my old grand pappy
I gotta give thanks to my man Archie Shepp
For staying true to inspiration and I don't half step
So I kick out the jams and tell you who I am
And I talk to the people like Les McCann

I ask God for a rhyme or two
A little something for the wise as well as the fool
A little something to affect a little taste of change
For the together and the strong as well as the deranged
I'll do you right like bobby knight
And then I'm rapping on the mic to the Broadway light
Stomp my hands, I clap my feet and
I'm bugging off Yusef Lateef
I got a match to my ass and I'm a keep it lit
I need to get some cash, call my accountant Britt
I'm rushing around town taking care of my functions
Always got one more thing so forget about function
We create this world and the problems go on
Create our lives and the things that go wrong
So to the deaf, the blind, look around and listen
To what it is you want and for what you're wishing",Alright Hear This
Beastie Boys,"As I develop the awakening mind
I praise the Buddhas as they shine
I bow before you as I travel my path
To join your ranks, I make my full-time task
For the sake of all beings I seek
The enlightened mind that I know I'll reap
Respect to Shantideva and all the others
Who brought down the Dharma for the sisters and brothers
I give thanks for this world as a place to learn
And for this human body that I know I've earned
And my deepest thanks to all sentient beings
For without them, there would be no place to learn what I'm seeing
There's nothing here that's not been said before
But I put it down now so that I'll be sure
To solidify my own views
And I'll be glad if it helps anyone else out too

If others disrespect me or give me flak
I'll stop and think before I react
Knowing that they're going through insecure stages
I'll take the opportunity to exercise patience
I'll see it as a chance to help the other person
Nip it in the bud before it can worsen
A chance for me to be strong and sure
As I think on the Buddhas who have come before
As I praise and respect the good they've done
Knowing love can conquer hate in every situation
We need other people in order to create
The circumstances for the learning that we're here to generate
Situations that bring up our deepest fears
So we can work to release them until they're cleared
Therefore, it only makes sense
To thank our enemies despite their intent

The Bodhisattva path is one of power and strength
A strength from within to go the length
Seeing others are as important as myself
I strive for a happiness of mental wealth
With the interconnectedness that we share as one
Every action that we take affects everyone
So in deciding for what a situation calls
There is a path for the good for all
I try to make my every action for that highest good
With the altruistic wish to achieve Buddhahood
So I pledge here before everyone who's listening
To try to make my every action for the good of all beings
For the rest of my lifetimes and even beyond
I vow to do my best, to do no harm
And in times of doubt, I can think on the Dharma
And the Enlightened Ones who've graduated Samsara",Bodhisattva Vow
Beastie Boys,"Like the blackbirds Ima do it fluid
Building rhymes like buildings, like a Stonehenge druid
Step up and get enlightened, educating my mind
I play the tape forward, it's not time to rewind
Step inside the motherfucker and I get my flow on
Amalgamate my style so I got something to go on
Seasons change when it comes their time
Fall brings the winter and on back to springtime
Well, it's the king Adrock and that's who I am
Listen all of y'all I'm not the son of Sam
'Cause I'm thin and I don't grin
But check it out people 'cause I love to go and swim
Caught up on the phone fiber optic distraction
Information super highway got the brain contraction
I'm the kung-fu master versus the sumo wrestler
Got the beats in Manhattan you can hear in Westchester
Well, my mother was born out in Coney Island
Raised on the L.E.S Manhattan Island
My dad camo out from Detroit and they had me
And back on through Ellis Island goes through the family tree
Well, I'm a six-point-seven on the Richter scale
Got rhymes gallore and then I never fail
Like gravy to potatoes, Luke to Darth Vader
I'm a souped-up sucker and I'll see you all later

You see me coming down the block with the funky cuts
You say (hey, Mike D!) and I say mic these nuts
I've got attractions like I'm Elvis Costello
Adam Yauch grab the mic 'cause you know you're my mellow
Well when I get it into the zone
I'm gonna take my mind to a place where I'm all alone
Ah well, I've got my shit and the rhyme style's kicking
My brain is flowing, honest like Abe Lincoln
'Cause I'm the fuckin' rhythm ace with the rhyme selection
Listen all y'all I rap with perfection
Because I got the mother fuckin' old school flavor
That you savor so watch your behavior
Talking other dimensions, levels higher
Why did Billy Joel say ""we didn't start the fire""
Take you to another realm, another level
I've got the funky rhymes but I'm not the funky devil
I step from minute to minute, lifetime to lifetime
Step from stage to stage to see it all unwind
Slowly but surely I seek to find my mind
And every wall that I face is ow my own design
Yeah, Glendale Boulevard, a-Boulevard
Glendale Boulevard is where I'm at
It's where I'm at, where I live
Check-it-check-it out 'cause my head is like a sieve and we turn it out",Do It
Beastie Boys,"So, just sit back and max and relax
Off tracks that I kick, come on and give it up
'Cause I get funky like diaper rash
And you know I'm mad spunky and I'm making cash
I've got sex rhymes like Victoria's got secrets
To all you porn peepers who are trying to peep this
I'm like Al Goldstein, I'm all about screwing
Lead my team to sixty wins like my man Pat Ewing
Like getting shot out the barrel of a wave
Like virgin pow on the peaks of a.k.
Like a sound that to the depths of the soul
Well that's the feeling that I make my goal


A little wine with my dinner so I'm in my grape ape
I feel like a winner when I make a mix tape
Because I get ill when I'm on the pause button
And I get my fill and you can't say nothing
More soul on this train then Don Cornelius
Got the mad subwoofer pumping bass for your anus
Just getting on the mic at the monthly function
Wires hitting switches connecting at the junction
Perlman's got beats and it ain't no secret
Dante found his shit but you know he freaked it
And so the story goes on and on
Down in S.D. 50 'till early morning",Flute Loop
Beastie Boys,"Drink a six-pack and then you play some ball
Walking down the stairs and then he starts to fall
Add on two joints and then he starts to sweat
Two hundred seventy five pounds that you can't forget

'Cause he's a heart attack, heart attack man
Spend all your money on your health insurance plan
Heart attack, heart attack man
Keep on getting bigger because you know that you can

Why do you force yourself on top of that girl?
Laugh with all your buddies because it's a man's, man's world
Someday that shit will come back to you
Throwing your weight around and shit is through

Heart attack, heart attack man
Going nowhere, you got no master plan
Heart attack, heart attack man

Weighs in at two-seventy-five
Yeah, my man is lucky to be alive
He's smokin', drinkin' too
My man the heart attack man is gonna be running over you
Got no goddamn respect
Yeah, better keep that big, big, bad bitch in check

Lungs full of tar and your stomach full of spam

Time to change your ways heart attack man",Heart Attack Man
Beastie Boys,"I don't get blind, I don't drink wine
I went and took a sledgehammer and I broke my nine
Because my life is mine, word is bond I rhyme
And every day I write the book down line by line
I'm feeling good when I do it like this
So come on and turn it up because you can't resist

Because I'm back with another track in which you lack
'Cause things is wack and that's a fact
Because I'm on time, you're shouting rewind
You know it's Adrock that's blowing your mind
My shit is rough and you know it is (so damn tough!)

I'm getting intense, not talking nonsense
I made up my mind, not sitting on the fence
I don't always know the right from the wrong
Do my best to figure it out and work it out in the long
I try to do a lot, more than I can chew
I balance out my ambitions what I got to do

Check it, better believe it y'all
Check it, better believe it y'all
This is rough and tough

'Cause you hide in broad day light, a parasite
A hypocrite, you take a peek quick
You turn your nose up (what), you think you're high up
You play it real safe and now your shit's fake
I seen you hawking and then you clock my style
And then you try to play it off like you think you're wild

D.I.Y., that means do it yourself
I don't sit around waitin' for someone's help
I don't sit back and say ""Good enough""
I keep on striving, reinventing, keepin' it off the cuff
So I kick the level up cahoot-ified
Mackadocius vibes, positively fortified

I'm throwing rhymes down, kickin' them downtown
Traveling high speed through the underground
I kick it freestyle, make it worth your while
I've got shelves of rhymes that I keep on file
I'm feeling good now, back home again
Well, New York City is the city that I feel at home in
A blast from the Grasshoff, awhile it's been
Stepping into the future again

Uh, and now I'm straight from eighty-eight
To ninety-three, to ninety-four, I'm out the door

Step into the party with the Fila fresh gear
People looking at me like I was David Koresh here

Kicking rhymes from the heart cause that's where I'm at
Fuck the bullshit, be it far from me to pop that

In the search for truth, I go a lot of ways
There's not a lot of peace that I find these days
I try to stay cool, I try to stay calm
But my life is getting hectic like a smoke bomb
So I'll say it like the group Huggy Bear
There's a boy-girl revolution of which you should be aware

You can't dis me, it ain't worth it, B
You put yourself down and you don't even see
'Cause I don't play that, I know who I am
For a minute I didn't but now I'm back again
I'm feeling strong, see, trust myself, G
Well, I stopped smoking cheeba and that was part of the key

We, we, we've got fire, we need water
There ain't no water, so I guess I ought to
Leave you broke in a comatose state of mind
And I'm blind and I'm working overtime, so check it
I keep my rhymes in my little black book
And I know you wanna take another look",The Scoop
Beastie Boys,"Butcher me on the court
Too many elbows to report
Now you're poking me in the eye
Bill Laimbeer motherfucker, it's time for you to die

Tough guy, it's time to check yourself
Dribbling the ball like the Biz can be bad for your health
Tough guy, what you gotta prove?
Moving like an elephant, that's your favorite move
Tough guy, your shit is going out

Box me out with your fat ass
Throw me around like a bounce pass
You've got a tombstone hanging over your dick
You cause a minor earthquake when you throw a moving pick

Tough guy, you think you're like the Shaq
Keep running around, you'll catch a heart attack
Tough guy, what are you giving me?
The way you're playing ball, well, you'll stop me from living, B

Tough guy, Tough guy
Tough guy, you're shit is weak
Tough guy, you fucking freak
Tough guy, I'll stick your shit
Tough guy",Tough Guy
Beastie Boys,"I can hear the trumpets blowing screaming out the end of time
Look around and listen and you'll see every sign
The waters are polluted as the forests are cut down
Bombing and drilling deep below ground
Check the prophecies from around the world
And look around now as it all unfurls
Look into yourself and see what goes on
Get a feeling in your heart of the right from wrong
Because the mother earth needs to be respected
Been far from too long that she's been neglected
Race against race, such a foolish waste
It's like cutting off your nose to spit your face
And at the end of the wars, what was the cost
It's clear that the earth was the one who lost
We are one with her as she is one with us
It's unreal how she is treated so unjust
As our planet grows smaller each and every day
Everyone affecting everyone in every way
We're all citizens of the world community
All here together and we're searching for unity
Over the years, I've grown and changed so much
Things I know now years ago, I couldn't touch
There are things I've done that I wouldn't do again
But I'm glad that I did 'cause I've learned from them
I just try to stay present right here, right now
No worries, no fears and without any doubts
It's about time

'Cause in these times, these changing times
A transition is occurring and I am not blind
As the pendulum swings a new age we enter
And with every swing, it draws closer to the center
Yes the storm before the calm and the wars that lead to love
Things must run their course so we push and we shove
But we're here to work it out in one way or another
To find a mutual respect for ourselves and one another
And the true key is a trust in self
For when I trust myself, I fear no one else
I took control of my life, just as anyone can
I want everyone to see it's in the palm of your hand
The past is gone, the future yet unborn
But right here and now is where it all goes on
I know we can fix it and it's not too late
I give respect to king and his nonviolent ways
I dream and I hope and I won't forget
Someday I'm going to visit on a free tibet
Someday I'm going to see us all joined as one
And it would be too bad to blow it up before we're done
'Cause we long behind the rage learning from the pain
The love behind the tension like the sun behind the rain
I'm sending loving light to all that is
To all creation and the life we live
I'm not preaching bull shit, just speaking my mind
'Cause I'm here now and it's about time",The Update
Beastie Boys,"I kick out the jams and tell you who I am
I said I'll make you shake your ass like Les MaCan
And the you're out talking shit like Yosemite Sam
You've got the elephant feet like Les McCan
Up the crack of dawn I'm on my way
We're talking two foot dump and there'll be no delay
'Cause I'm gone, the shit's getting out of hand
I'm changing my middle name to first Trem
I'm walking on the rhythm like Philippe Petite
I've got hole in my mouth where my teeth should be
You ask whatever happenened to the rappin' duke
I heard the Captain's gonna sign him to Jive and that's the truth
taking care of my functions still smokin, up the shrubery
I stopped eating chicken 'cause the shit was too rubbery
Produce organic from my own yard
Only the freshest herbs and growing's not too hard

Dreaming on it, screaming on it, ready to get dumb
Waking up my long joint, ready to get some
Looking at my board and my old boots
Seeing a waist deep champagne moment of truth
And on the court I've got game like my brother Matt
I give a shout out so where you at
But don't get souped Mathew 'cause I'm a take ya
Horatio Park right now and I'm a shake ya
Give me the fresh count 'cause you know that I'm stressed out 
I need some inspiration so get the best out 
Like Rock Master Scott, I'm on the request line
Writing the fresh rhyme, having the best time
Good vibes flowing all around
Not a worry in mind as the friends around
A shout out to Linda riding pow forever
Well the Bird is the word and you're as light as a feather

Well I smoke a bag of rat weed 'cause I don't care
and I'm waking old ladies out their underwear
I like the boomin' grannies in big old panties
I'm giving, it to grandma making her crazy
I might be a white boy but I'm no goofy
Got beats like Bobalou on ""I Love Lucy""
I'm not like the Skipper on ""Fantasy Island""
I'm more like Captain Shtupping when I go back whylin'
The Cire Traverse out to Death shoot
or S.T.H. when they let me back at the Deuce
'Cause I can't get enough of that funky stuff
When the going gets rough ain't going out in the sluff

Get down we've got the sound sensation

I've got an old school flow like Mike Mcgill
'Cause Yauch's on the upright, the shit just ain't funny
Got fat bass lines like Russel Simmons steals money
Got clientele, you know I rock well
And then you're on my dick because I'm d.f.l
Yeah, Mike 'cause playing the bass is my favorite shit
I might be a hack on the stand up but I'm working at it
I get my hair cut correct like Anthony Mason

I'll grab the microphone and fuck it up
I might seem out there, a little deranged

I'll grab the golf clubs and I'm off, I'm Audi so check me

Got to get it together and see what's happening
I go one two like my name was biz mark
But I had to do the shit just let me embark

Because I had to talk about the times that I rhyme
And when m.c.s come in my face, I'm like mace
Because I back them off with the quills

So, yo tip, what's up with the boot on your feet
I've got the timbos on the toes and this is how it goes
Oh one two, oh my god
One two, oh my god, I've got some shit

I've got the kung fu grip behind my green trap kit
Never ever ever smoking crack
Never ever ever fucking wack
I eat the fuckin' pineapple now & laters

Listen to me now, don't listen to me later
Fuck it 'cause I know I didn't make it fuckin' rhyme for real

I threw that trash can through her window cause you know I got dissed
Your old lady left you and you went insane
You blew yourself up in the back of the six train
Take my advice at any price a gorilla like your mother is mighty weak
Sucking down pints till I didn't know

Clap tracks line the spaces places papers people stack
Back track through the minutes when the thoughts went insane
I pulled the picture off the cover and blew out the mind games
People say this is the play list of the void non-bound
But I can say this is the plainness of the peace I've found
It's not the sorrow or the pity that we hope to dismantle
It's the cast of past dice lighting both ends of the candles
Scandelescent in the means I have dreamed on the schemes
Reunited in the times of such picturesque scenes
Can I get a witness to testify?
Open your eyes, realize, electrify

So I plan and I scam and write it off on my taxes
It's times like these I'll just go with the decisions of the masses
And to the crowds who've come before with their profit massing ways
To the greed that fucked it up and brought it down to today
With pain I stand sane and remain holding strong
Whilst all around me those who clowned me are now drowning by the throngs
It's illogical the actions that are typically displayed
A set back ain't all that much problem to invade
So I will glow like a lantern on a new moon night
I'll fight violence with these hands that weren't built to fight
But like a furnace burning coal my goals are bound to burn in flames
Whether achieved or dismantled by the agendas displayed
Can I get a witness to testify?
Open your eyes, realize, electrify",Electrify
Beastie Boys,"I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros
I'm scheming rhyme against reason like it was flow against know
But beyond the concepts and emotions that rise
To the interconnectedness that underlies
The lies upon lies have lost their meaning
The plies upon plies of consciousness that is being
Over and over I fall I learned to walk from a crawl
It's not sad it's just the way and the purpose of it all

Now every word that you heard that I said that you felt
Was put in place in the space as they were shuffled and dealt
I steal feels from reels but I pay my respects
Paying compliments and disses and deciphering affects
Words are water as I court her, as she is pristine
Words and mics fall to dust and all that's left is the feelings
I give in and I win I try to never complain
Intentions venture to center and then they set the stage
But I'll remain sane making gain without pain
Staining trains with names and driving lanes to the refrain
And keep it positive as pains taking as it is
I'll never turn back cause that's the way I've got to live
I'll never turn back cause that's the way I've got to live
I'll never turn back cause that's the way I've got to live

So like a cloud carries rain I'm gonna carry my rhyme
Coming like thunder with lightning timing
No hesitation in gestation of thoughts and plans
Ferment time like wine no ploys or scams
Like the islands dot the oceans in the endless seas
Ideas coming to me in answer to my pleas
Woke up this morning right out of a dream
Reached for my pen and pad because my mind was on a rhyme scheme
What can I do with these bones and flesh?
With these animated thoughts in a world repressed?
I'm going down like the rhythms on the winds of change
I'm keeping calm under pressure like a deep-sea range
I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros
I'm like Toucan Sam when I follow my nose
I'm giving shouts to Gandhi, Garvey and King
His Holiness and all enlightened beings
I'll be the one who screams it on the microphone
I'll be the one who brings it inside your home
But the words ain't mine I just pass em along
For Betty Williams and her friends I sing this song
And more ink from my pen and more tears from my eyes
And more crimes are committed as I say these lines",Flowin' Prose

This song is the grass you're grazin'
Add a little flange and phase in

Beastie Boys,"It's like a flag at half mast as frames click fast
Not a thing will last as past is past
Like stacks of thoughts that got played and worn
Used over and over till they were tired and torn
Like a broken clock that can't tell time
Like a thick ass book that's filled with wack rhymes
Like a scorching blaze that burned the sand
Like a band that planned and planned and planned
And flew down like a raven in the dark of night
And snatched up the worm helpless to fight
And brought it back to the nest singing microphone check

It's like sand in one hand You can't hold for long
Like scheming on a plan that goes all wrong
It's like fudge and caramel they're not the same
And it's a shame all you talk is game
You act like a diamond waiting to be set
In a gold ring, as if, I bet
As time goes by in this give and take
As long as I learn I will make mistakes
Now, what do I want? What do I need?
Why do I want it? What's in it for me?
It's the imagery of technology
Is what you get is what you see
Don't worry your mind

Beastie Boys,"Hello...
It's times like this when I just can't stop
Can't wind your body without the body rock
Got schemes, schematics blue prints on file
You gotta have dreams to make it all worthwhile
So as I take my time and realign
I wonder what it is I hope to find
I don't mean to brag I don't mean to boast
But I'm intercontinental when I eat French toast
Adrock with the new addition edition
Gettin' on down for the year 2000
A slight distraction can get you paid
And when it comes to that type shit I paved the way

BBoys to the early morn
BGirls be rockin on and on
BGirls to the break of dawn
BBoys be rockin on and on

Dogs love me cause I'm crazy sniffable
I bet you never knew I got the ill peripheral
In your home I'm cloned I'm on your headphones
I love it when you spazz out all alone
Cause I'm that fool that broke the key
I'm unlockable so don't check me
I got weight on my shoulders and things on my mind
The sky is falling and I'm falling behind
So I synthesize sounds as I patch my brain
Insane mind games move quick like flames
So now I wonder how sometimes you never know
Who be rockin y'all in ster-er-eo?
In ster-er-eo!
In ster-er-eo!
In stereo...

No time like the present to work shit out
That's what I'm going on and on and on about
Not fakin' just makin' beats in the dungeon
Keep that shit funky cause the odor is pungent
No shame in my game just par for the path
I try to hone my craft because at hands the task
But I find I'm not playing with a full deck
I'm up to my neck like Toulouse Latrec
All I want to know is when is checkout time
So I could be in heaven with the rhythm rock rhyme
And when I'm with my man Shadi rock at the gates
We'll be rockin' rhythms over disco breaks

BBoys to the early morn
BGirls be rockin on and on
BGirls to the break of dawn
BBoys be rockin on and on

Beastie Boys,"Something on the windowsill
Caught her eye and held her still
The cars pass by outside
Nowhere left to hide

Picture this now crystal clear
Nothing left to hold her here
And creeping up meanwhile
Traces of a smile

Something on the windowsill
Caught her eye and held her still
The cars pass by outside
Here I go flying
Open wide to see if I could fly

Beastie Boys,"Beastie Beastie Beastie Beastie Boys gettin' live on the spot
Puttin' all kinds of shame in the game you got
We keep the party movin' to the broad day light
G-E-T-L-I-V-E alright

Trans-hypnotic robotic can't stop it
No limits to this style you know you can't lock it
First you mock it, rock it and then you stock it
But I've got the styles that are always in the pocket
Like a bird floating down on a New York breeze
Every thought in the mind is a planted seed
So watch the mind or the thoughts will stack
Before you know it they're boomeranging on back
Well I'm the king of Boogle there is none higher
I get eleven points off the word 'quagmire'
Fools can't see me and that's how it is
And that's how I like it and that's my biz

Beastie Beastie Boys gettin' live on the spot
Puttin' all kinds of shame in the game you got
We keep the party movin' to the broad day light
G-E-T-L-I-V-E alright

Time's an illusion as the moments race by
Too fast to really grasp though we may try
Deny, till we die, ooh my my
These thoughts that mislead and then multiply
Second by second and minute by minute
""It's like lotto you gotta be"" ""in it to win it""
Shakin' mind breakin' on their own demise
Lies tax to the max and they'll be feelin' those vibes
So tell me what you need that you have got
Fiending on power will make your blood clot
It starts with the greed and then goes all wrong
That's why we can't all just get along
We're all connected like a Lego set
One equaling one together like a croquette
Whether we have or have not yet met
Well, it ain't no thing and it ain't no sweat

You're caught in a panic and it's rattled your brain
The selfish ways just can't maintain
But these are the breaks when you try and come fake
Don't come with the rhymes that you just half baked
Well I'm the Benihana chef on the SP12
I chop the fuck out the beats left on the shelf
You be like 'Hello Nasty, where you been?'
It's time you brought the grimy beats out the dungeon
I jumped outside the house with my Walkman on
I get so hyped when I hear this song
It's gonna keep me happy like all day long
So go and talk shit cause it just makes me strong
Don't grease my palms with your filthy cash
Multinationals spreading like a rash
I might stick around or I might be a fad
But I won't sell my songs for no TV ad

From the satellite dish to your joy stick
It's the night of the living cable box
Wires coming up from around the block
Remote control to change the station
But that won't change your situation
Have you seen what I mean
I'm the little gnome that's in your dreams
So I say this rhyme built by design
To take you beyond space and time
Said who is the man making diamonds out of coal
The man pushing buttons on remote control

Re-mote, control
Remote control

Until your back's up against the wall
You never know yourself that much at all
So you've got to share your love with a friend
That's all that you've got left in the end
Living in this city of pure confusion
People mislead by their own illusion
All this action, no satisfaction
We're all linked together like a chain reaction
Play or fold, love is bold
What is the future that will unfold?
Some like it hot, others like it cold
But we all want to hold the remote control

Re-mote, control
Re-mote, control
Re-mote, control
Re-mote, control

Things get hectic quick
All of the sudden I'm in the thick
Too much drama all around
Distractions booming in sensurround
Like a rainy day's Earth won't sit still
Sliding on down a hill
Sometimes life seems to stall
But never be ungrateful y'all

Y'all gather round to hear my golden voice
'Cause when it's time to rhyme you know I get noice

So watch your back when he takes the stage
Or he'll send you off on a naked rampage

We be getting down with no delay
Mixmaster Mike, whatcha got to say?

Sweet and sour like a tangerine
Fresh like a box of Krispy Kremes

Down with freckles from around the way
Peace to Bambata and Jazzy Jay

(MCA)
I rock on the mic from here to Bombay
I give it my best and say come what may
'Cause everybody's got their dues to pay
I'm looking side ways like my man Pele

(Mike D)
Getting on like Ali boom ba yay
So fed up with racism today
Time to speak up and not turn away
Make the sun shine when it's cloudy and gray

(chorus)
Dip dip dive so socialize
Open up your ears and clean out your eyes
If you learn to love your in for a surprise
It could be nice to be alive

(Adrock)
I'm taking doody rhymes to a brand new height
I shine on the mic like UltraBright
Created a monster with these rhymes I write
Goatee metal rap please say goodnight

(MCA)
Now here's a little something you may not like
My dj's name is Mix Master Mike
It's a real pity that you people got to bite
But I could understand because he sounds so nice

(Mike D)
Reading you the news cause I'm Country Mike
Use a microphone like Shazam uses tights
Try to keep clear of that hate and spite
So I keep my mind still like the still of night

(Adrock)
Now who in the world do you want to fight?
It's agianst the system we should unite
Homophobics ain't alright
If you learn to love then you might love life

(chorus)

(MCA)
Now you can shuffle numbers but facts is facts
So many billionares while so many lack
So before the poor decide to react
Come on party people and share up your stacks

(Mike D)
Now I'm a break it down to the brass tacks
Do the Biz Mark and the cabbage patch
You try to turn the key but then you broke the latch
Sneak into my files for some rhymes to snatch

(Adrock)
I'd like to have a say on the income tax 
Don't want to help build bombs and that's the facts
No money for health care so what's the catch?
The man got you locked with the keys to the latch

(MCA)
Mike and Adam have got my back
You bring the mics and we'll bring the raps
Turn on the P.A. and rock your shack
Don't smoke cheeba can't stand crack

There never was a city kid truer and bluer
There's more to me than you'll ever know
And I've got more hits than Sadaharu Oh
Tom Thumb, Tom Cushman or Tom Foolery
Date women on T.V. with the help of Chuck Woolery
Words are flowing out just like the Grand Canyon
And I'm always out looking for a female companion
Threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib
I took off her moccasins and put on my bib
Wheelin' and dealin' I make a little bit of stealing
I'll bring her back to the place and your dress I'm peeling
Your body's on time and your mind is appealing
Staring at the cracks up there up on the ceiling
Such and such'll be thr bass that I'm throwing
I'm talking to the girl telling her I'm all-knowing
She's talking to the kid, kid, to the kid
I'm telling her every lie that you know that I never did
Hey ladies, get funky

All the ladies in the house
The ladies, the ladies

Well, me in the corner with a good looking daughter
I dropped my drawers, said welcome back Kotter
We was cutting up the rug, she started cutting up the carpet
In my apartment, I begged her, please stop it
The gift of gab is the gift that I have
And that girl ain't nothing but a crab
Educated no, stupid yep
And when I say stupid, I mean stupid fresh
I'm not James at fifteen or Chachi in charge
I'm Adam and I'm adamant about living large
With the white sassoons and the looks that kill
Makin' love in the back of my Coupe De Ville
I met a little cutie she was all hopped up on zootie
I liked the little cutie but I kicked her in the bootie
'Cause I don't kinda go for that messin' around
You be listening to my records' a number one sound
Just step to the rhythm, step, step to the ride
I've got an open mind so why don't you all get inside?
Tune in, turn on to my tune that's live
Ladies flock like bees to a hive
Hey ladies, get funky

Hey, hey, hey, hey ladies (girls, girls, girls)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies
One more time, ain't it funky now?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey ladies
(Ain't it funky now?) well, you know that

She got a gold tooth you know she's hardcore
She'll show you a good time then she'll show you the door
Break up with your girl it ended in tears
Vincent Van Gogh go and mail that ear
Call her in the middle of the night when I'm drinking
Phone booth on the corner is damp and it's stinking
Said come on over it was me that she missed
I threw that trash can through her window 'cause you know I got dissed
Your old lady left you and you went insane
You blew yourself up in the back of the six train
Take my advice at any price a gorilla like your mother is mighty weak
Sucking down pints until I didn't know
Woke up in the morning with a one-ton ho
'Cause I announce I like girls that bounce
With the weight that pays about a pound per ounce
Girls with curls and big long locks
And beatnik chicks just wearing their smocks
Walking high and mighty like she's number one
(She thinks she's the passionate one!)

A curve ball's what my pitch is

It'll spin you around and throw you in a hex
Until you feel no pain inside your brain
All your worries are soothed by the sound effects

Don't let me begin about heroin
Living six feet deep just ain't the move

Working his way out west now, the only sure thing's his next meal

America was young, but she was a-growing
Layin' tracks across the prairie, not knowing where they're goin'
His mama didn't want him leaving, but now he's headin' out west
She said, ""Please, don't go."" But he said ""If I don't, I'll never rest.""
It wasn't always easy: some of the boys died 
Johnny wrote her letters, but he received no replies

Johnny - he worked on the railroad, pounding on iron and steel
Working his way out west now, the only sure thing's his next meal

Johnny reached San Francisco tired and broke without a dime
Started panning for gold just a-hoping he would find
The gold wasn't a-rushin', but Johnny kept on minin'
Trying to send his mama somethin' with the letters he was signin'
And one day Johnny finally got a reply
When he opened Mama's letter, he began to cry
She's a-writing from her deathbed, and this is what she said:
""Please, don't be mad at me, son, 'cause tomorrow I'll be dead.""

I'm hip to the shit that you're trying to scam
Gnip, Gnop I got zits to pop
I'm an exceptional professional that just don't stop, so
Pack up your bag and your mic and don't wait
E.T. phone home now get the funk out my face
You know we shake'em bake'em then we take'em
Treat MCs like leaves, go out and rake'em
Sell our CDs on Canal before we make'em
Serve you on a platter like steak and bacon

Taking punk MCs out, I'm all about
My to-do list today is turn the party out
Getting hot in here no room to breathe
I got my pen in my hand so you best not sleep
No, I'm not Herman Munster or Dr. Spock
I go by the name of the King Adrock
So here's a match, my ass and your face
Listen when I tell you dog
I'm in your crawlspace (crawlspace)

You're in front of my house and you know that's wack
Bite my rhymes with a scanner from Radio Shack
You suckers try to front like you've got the force
But I'll slay like Vader sip you for a first course
Don't even get me started on that intercourse, aah!
Don't step into my zone or even periphery
Can't grab a hold of my style it's too slippery
The way you act a fool son you can't erase
And you're running on your way like steeple chase
You tried to take my title now put it back in place
But now you're busted wearing panties and lace
Stealing my style from that trophy case
But my drive's secure like on an army base
You're sneaking and peeking and trying to give chase
But you ain't never gonna catch me, I'm in your crawlspace (crawlspace)

Calibrate your sonar when I'm in your realm
'Cause you know we're getting scarier and scarier
And this extends beyond the Tri-State Area
Omnipresent and omnipotent
My rhymes are whales and yours are rodents
This means huge compared to very small
You look a little chilly, can I get you a shawl?
'Cause these rhymes are two-hundred proof
They're like anvils lined up on a roof
Waiting to drop on your corny melon
'Cause were not buying what you're selling
First you want to battle then you start to whine

You sold a few records but don't get slick
'Cause you used a corked bat to get those hits
Yeah you've been in the game, your career is long
But when you really break it down, you've only got two songs
MCs are like clay pigeons and I'm shootin' skeet
I just yell pull and Mike drops the beat

Takin' out the trash when you pull out the pen

I represent that stupid, that's for sure
You be like ""oh yeah Adam, real mature""
I'd like a lettuce, tomato and Munster on rye
All this cheese gonna make me cry
Gorgonzola, Provolone
Don't even get me started on this microphone
I'm blowin' up like my name is Joe Bazooka
I'm a super-dooper MC party pooper
On a track so slick it'll make you feel all queasy
Make you do like Fred Sanford with ""I'm comin' Wheezy!""

Everybody get down, huh
Everybody get down, huh
Everybody get down, huh
Huh, huh, huh, huh, shazam

On the court I go by the name Praying Mantis
Got the edge and I've got the advantage
If you could see things from my vantage
Point then you could better understand this
I'm in the lab all day I scrabble all night
I got a bedazzler so my outfit's tight
When it comes to panache I can't be beat
I got the most style from below Fourteenth Street
Internationally known as the Keebler Elf
Can't keep a catalog up on the shelf
You know I splash on beats like sauce on spaghetti
Putting MCs out of business like they're Crazy Eddie

Everybody get down, huh
Everybody get down, huh
Everybody get down, huh
Huh, huh, huh, huh, shazam

I know you're sitting pretty in the Hampty Hamps
Posing like you're rolling with that camp
In layman's terms let me break it down
You're flipping and flopping just like a flounder
I'm a hip hop scholar while you're left back
So Jeckle and Rush go back to Lefrac
I'm a simple man like Chance de Gardner
I'm working nine to five, Dolly Parton
I got rhymes for jerks that's bringing on drama
Which rhyme you want first, the one about your mama?
Goodness gracious, golly-gee
Shazam, freak out with the genie

Everybody get down, huh
Everybody get down, huh
Everybody get down, huh

You want peace for the people then ya say alright
Because George W's got nothing on me
We got to take the power from he
When I'm on the mic I feel good to go
Like a snow day for school with hot cocoa
So don't speak what I heard, just say what I know
And my, ahh
My zodiac sign is Scorpio
Look what the cat dragged in
The crème-de-la-crème without the skim
So take a rest and mind your own biz
And that's it that's all that's all there is

(Fresh, fresh, fresh, for you, for you, for you)
(That's fresh, fresh, fresh, for you, for you, for you)

One for Brooklyn, two for Manhattan
Let's go to work, get those hands clappin'
Make you bounce, rock, roll and skate
Don't underrate how I operate
It ain't what you say, it's what you mean
Intention leads to action, that is my theme
So pay attention now as I begin to recap
Puttin' words and ideas stacked back to back
Some rhymes go flat, well mine go fizz
I got no time for the drama 'cause stress is for kids
'Cause when you're dead and buried, well, you got no biz

The time and place for the mind is here and now
Keep the mind present less to worry about
But like the hammer to the nail hit the nail on the head
Well I don't shoot blanks and I don't shoot lead
'Cause I'm a freaky streaker like Winnie the Pooh
A T-shirt and no pants and I dance the boogaloo
Like George Whipple on New York One
Got a hairy (ew!) and that's no fun
I'm in the rhyme zone, a different time zone
And on the microphone you know that I'm at home
It's time we looked past all our differences
An' that's it that's all that's all there is, come on

Bette Davis getting older, can't take a rain check
It's time to let 'em know what we expect
Stop building SUVs strung out on OPEC
Hold up, wait up you know we come correct
You wanna change things up, well, hey then get set
It's easier to sit back than stick out your neck
It's easier to break it than build it correct
We've got a president we didn't elect
The Kyoto treaty he decided to neglect
And still the US just wants to flex
Keep doin' that bop we gonna break our necks

Ey yo, hate-filled people wanna keep us in check
Tearin' down each other is what they expect
If you want love, well hey that's a bet
We've got to give before we can get
Waiting like a batter who is on deck
When it's time to wreck shop then shop I'll wreck
So let's calibrate and check our specs
We need a little shift on over towards the left
I don't really know but I suspect
I think it's due time that we inspect
How they get their information and their facts are checked
Another press conference someone's talking out their neck

(It takes a second to wreck it) it takes time to build
(It takes a second to wreck it) it takes time to build
(You gots to chill, to chill, to chill, to chill, to chill)

So step up to the window and place your bets
Is the US gonna keep breaking necks?
Maybe it's time that we impeach Tex
And the military muscle that he wants to flex
By the time Bush is done what will be left?
Selling votes like E-pills up in the discotheque
Environmental destruction and the national dept
But plenty of dollars left in the fat war chest
What the real deal why you can't connect
Why you hating people that you never met
Didn't your mama teach you to show some respect?
Why not open your mind for a sec?

I've been coming to where I am from the get-go
Find that I can groove with the beat when I let go
So put your worries on hold
Get up and groove with the rhythm in your soul

Mowing down M.C.'s like I'm mowing the lawn
I go off like nothing can phase me
You think we'll ever meet Stevie?
(One of these days, D!)
But I can stand my ground and I am down

And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads

I'd listen to the records and they'd inspire
Sit down to write and the pen breathes fire
Construct a rhyme with specific intent
Flowin' from and brain cells right through the pen
And then I put the book down grab a hold the mic
Words flowin' so cold turn water to ice
Come through the wire saturate the tape
You put me in the mix nice it up with the plate
And then they press it on wax sell it in the store
The DJ spin the record out on the dance floor
Comin' through the speakers to shake your eardrum
Brain cells get lit then you hear where we're comin' from

Burnin' ya shop - my beats blowin' up when it drop
Independently I rock when spittin' game 
Remain gettin' change but the motto is still the same

Ordained in the gospel of rap - preachin' the facts
I'm black - bearin' witness to that - Throw ya hands to the sky
My battle cry is high till the day that I day
I'm addicted to the rhyme 'cuz all the time I find
I'm rippin' lines and fuck that i'm goin' for mine
See I do it for the love - it ain't about the papes
The dollars that I make be the icing on the cake

Songs droppin' bombs on America's youth
Burnin' ya suit - Mash out the dollas and scoot
Droppin' it hot- but not sellin' out for tha loot

Hold up another minute you can see what I mean
Labels wanna play games its tha money that talk
I'm a bad muthafucka and I'm walkin' tha walk
Wanna promote this pop shit rap and rock shit
Fake thug rappin' on some fake as 'Pac shit
Shame how the mainstream lacks a brainstream
on each radio yo ya hearing the same thing
Say they wanna sign then they decline 
With lines that there ain't enough thug in tha rhyme 
What a crime when you gotta preach killin to sell
I rebel - yo ya fake A&R and advance can go to hell

Step to my team ya dreams they get wrecked

Got a really big head let it taste the ground

The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that he's just a fool, 
And he never gives an answer,

Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.
 
Well on his way his head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him,

I often wonder what you're thinking of
I hope it's me and love love love

So I hope there'll come a day
When you'll say, ""Mm you're my little girl""

It's not the first time that it's happened to me,
It's been a long lonely time
And it's funny funny to see that I'm about to lose my mind mind mind

So I hope there'll come a day

Béatrice Ardisson,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.",Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds

Die Sterne leuchten hell
Die Nacht ist für uns zwei allein gemacht
Und mein Herz schlägt immer schneller
Und der Himmel wird schon Heller

Und ich tanze nur mit dir
Hab heute Nacht mein Glück gefunden

Beatrice Egli,"Es ist alle früh, kurz nach Mitternacht
Ich geh heute aus, hab ich mir gedacht
Und mein Herz das sehnt, sehnt sich so nach Liebe
Plötzlich steht er da und sagt leise Hallo
Schaut mir in die Augen, ja ganz einfach so
Und ich spüre nur, diese Gefühle

1000 Fantasien durchlebe ich in meinen Gedanken
Es ist wie Magie, doch heute Nacht passiert es nie

Flieg, flieg, flieg nicht so nah ans Licht
Träume sie verbrennen, wenn ein Flügel bricht

Flieg, flieg, flieg nicht so nah ans Licht
Engel fallen tief, wenn ihr Herz zerbricht

Er nimmt meine Hand, mir wird kalt und heiß
In mir brennt ein Feuer doch ich weiß
Ich will einfach mehr, ich will wahre Gefühle
Dann der erste Kuss, draußen wird es schon hell
Ich bin wie verzaubert, doch das geht mir zu schnell
Und mein Herz es warnt mich vor diesen Gefühle

1000 Fantasien durchlebe ich in meinen Gedanken
Es ist wie Magie, doch heute Nacht passiert es nie

Flieg, flieg, flieg nicht so nah ans Licht

Ein Mann ein Wort ein Leben lang
Verdammt das wünsch ich mir

Versprich mir nicht den Himmel
Wenn's schon bis Wolke 1 nicht reicht
Casanovas gibt's wie Sand am Meer
Wer sagt mir was Liebe heißt

Sag mir wo sind all die Romeos
Wo sind sie nur hin
Was ist mit den echten Männern los
Wo sind sie nur hin

Ich frag wo sind all die Romeos
Schreit mal ganz laut hier
Ein Mann ein Wort ein Leben lang
Verdammt das wünsch ich mir

Ein Mann ein Wort ein Leben lang
Verdammt das wünsch ich mir",Wo sind all die Romeos
Beatrice Lillie,"I've been cherishing,
Through the perishing
winter nights and days,
A funny little phrase
That means so much to me,
That you've got to be
With me heart and soul,
For on you the whole thing leans.

Come with me and leave the noisy crowds,
Sunlight shines for us above the clouds.
Please don't turn away
Or my dream will stay
Hidden out of sight,
Among a lot of ""might have beens""!

A room with a view,
And you,
And no-one to worry us,
No one to hurry us through
This dream we've found.

We'll gaze at the sky,
And try
To guess what it's all about,
Then we will figure out why
The world is round!

We'll be as happy and contented as birds upon a tree,
High above the mountains and the sea.

We'll bill and we'll coo-ooo-oo,
And sorrow will never come,
Oh, will it ever come true,
Our room with a view?

A room with a view,
And you,
And no-one to give advice,
That sounds like a paradise few
Could fail to choose.

With fingers entwined,
We'll find
Relief from the preachers
Who always beseech us to mind
Our P's and Q's.

We'll watch the whole world pass before us while we are sitting still,
Leaning on our own window sill.

We'll bill and we'll coo-ooo-oo,
And maybe a stork will bring
This, that and t'other thing
to our room with a view.","I Hate Spring [From ""New Faces of 1934]"
Beatriz Adriana,"Unos dicen que el hombre no llora
Otros dicen que el hombre es el rey
Yo les digo que todo es mentira
Que el hombre si llora por una mujer

Nada importa que sea muy valiente
Ni que tenga medallas de honor
Porque el hombre se vuelve cobarde
Y pierde su orgullo por un gran amor

Y llora por ella, Y toma licor
Y aunque sea mucho hombre se arrastra y se humilla nomas por su amor
Y que el hombre sera el que gobierna

Claramente lo dice la ley
Pero basta el embrujo de un beso

Y de ese momento, La Reina es el Rey
Nada importa que sea muy valiente
Para todo le sobra el valor

Y tampoco a podido evitarlo
También a llorado por un gran amor

Y llora por ella, Y toma licor
Y aunque sea mucho hombre se arrastra y se humilla nomas por su amor

Por eso les digo
No importa la ley",La Reina Es el Rey
Beatríz Luengo,"¿Ey mamá, me puedes tú contar
Por qué hoy no he visto el sol?
¿Por qué no quiero estar?

Di tú que eres mayor
¿Me darías sólo una razón?
Para poder callar
Esas voces que hay en mi interior
Oh mamá

Te escribo, no puedo decírtelo
Oh mamá, no
Me marcho, no quiero decirte
Oh mamá, no

Y donde miro encuentro lágrimas, oh no
Cerca navega mi alma
Y donde miro encuentro lágrimas en ti
Piensa que vives dentro, mi corazón

Donde voy dicen que volver
Es posible con la pasión
De los que recordéis mi voz

Abrázate a papá y dile que quiero volar
Para poder llegar allí donde nadie llegó
Oh mamá

Te escribo, no puedo decírtelo
Oh mamá no
Me marcho, no quiero decirte
Oh mamá no

Y donde miro encuentro lágrimas, oh no
Cerca navega mi alma
Y donde miro encuentro lágrimas en ti
Piensa que vives dentro, mi corazón

Y donde miro encuentro lágrimas, oh no
Cerca navega mi alma
Y donde miro encuentro lágrimas en ti
Piensa que vives dentro, mi corazón

",No Quiero Estar
Beatríz Luengo,"Preciosa, ahora que estamos los dos
Acompañando al silencio que vino a este encuentro 
Entre tu voz y mi voz

Quisiera no equivocar la ocasión
Busco palabras perfectas
Entre mi conciencia y lo que está en mi razón

Y cuanto más, y más, y más
Intento romper el hielo
Miro tus ojos frente a mí 
Brillando como un caramelo

Y quiero dejar de ser y estar
Y pido a Dios que se pare el tiempo
Entonces suspiras, te toco y muero

Sólo quiero mirarte y olvidar el pasado
Reducir el espacio entre tu piel y mis manos
No digas lo siento, no existe el lamento
Quiero todo, todo para mí

Te confieso que quise y no pude olvidarme
De tu dulce sonrisa y tus pequeños detalles
Llegado el momento, no existe lamento 
Y quiero todo, todo para mí

Propongo una tregua entre tú y yo
Dejemos atrás la batalla, colguemos las armas 
Y bandera blanca pa'l corazón, mira

Seguro que no saldrá bien la ecuación
Porque el amor no es perfecto
Y es que lo perfecto no le va a la pasión

Y cuanto más, y más, y más
Intento romper el hielo
Pierdo la gravedad y siento por segundos que me caigo al suelo

Y siento que es verdad
Que la ley de Newton no se equivoca
Porque suspiras, te toco y muero

Sólo quiero mirarte y olvidar el pasado
Reducir el espacio entre tu piel y mis manos
No digas lo siento, no existe el lamento
Quiero todo, todo para mí

Te confieso que quise y no pude olvidarme
De tu dulce sonrisa y tus pequeños detalles
Llegado el momento, no existe lamento 
Y quiero todo, todo para mí",Ley de Newton

Hold me close, don`t let me go
Run your fingers through my hair
All worries drift away
Everything will always be alright

Don`t think about tomorrow
Who knows what I can bring
Let`s live for the moment
Touching eternity

All worries drift away
Every thing is always alright",Love Song

Are fading
You were once mine
Never unkind
A long sigh
A soft caress
Now a silence
An emptiness
I'm alone
Staring through
The past I knew
I miss you

Streets are empty
Space surrounding
Sighs soft lullabies
Blurred reflection
A passing perfection
Scarring deep inside
Need a place to hide
From the rain

The cold breeze
Brings you back to me
I smell you in the air
I'm broken beyond repair
Patience
In short supply
I can't replace you
I wouldn't want to try

I'm alone and maybe
It's what should be
Do you miss me
Isolation will repeat
I feel so incomplete

Streets are empty
Space surrounding
Sighs soft lullabies
Blurred reflection
A passing perfection
Scarring deep inside
Need a place to hide from the rain

Streets are empty
Filled with millions
Cold, with empty souls
Searching everywhere
Nothing's ever there
The night inside me grows
I disappear below

Floating higher and higher
A wonderful feeling
Everything around me became suddenly
Unreal
As if in a dream

Streets are empty
Space surrounding
Sighs soft lullabies
Blurred reflection
A passing perfection
Scarring deep inside
Need a place to hide from the rain

I disappear below",City

Beaver Nelson,"You kissed your loved one good-bye 
On a cold, foggy day 
I guess you didn't know that I'd go so far away 
You knew there'd come a time 
When the road would call my name 
And we`d have to put a hold on 
All those dreams we made 

So take my heart - I've already taken yours 
This wound won't heal 

I'm alone and cold inside - 
Is there a moment we haven't shared 
Two hearts drawn as one - 
Now I stare at an empty chair 
You called and said last night 
I've been waiting for your kiss 
Still I lie here at night as I think of the things I miss 

So take my heart - I've already taken yours 
This wound won`t heal 

Tell me - do you miss me like I miss you girl? 
Hold me - in your heart - I'll never be lost again 
Tell me - do you miss me like I miss you girl? 
Hold me - in your heart - I'll never be lost again

I need you with me - oh girl, tell me

Viaja un océano

Que las llanuras de mi tierra
Se juntan con el cielo
Y allí descanso yo
Y busco mi recuerdo.

Hay quien prefiere lo grande
Y a mi me gusta lo pequeño
Que la distancia te ayuda a mirar
Con mucho menos miedo

Quiero volver a cerrar los ojos
Y ver lo que yo quiero
Que no tengo miedo a que pase el tiempo
Sino que pase y se pierdan los recuerdos.

Está lo que más quise lo que más quiero
Que acumulamos mucho
Y respiramos menos
Que el aire cada día es mucho menos fresco
Que cada día que pasa sigo echándote de menos.

Que vaya por donde vaya
Aún te huelo
Que las llanuras de mi tierra
Se juntan con el cielo
Y allí descanso yo
Y busco mi recuerdo.

He washed my sins away (oh happy day)
Oh happy day (oh happy day)

He taught me how to watch, fight and pray, fight and pray
And live rejoicing every, everyday

Oh, happy day

He taught me how

Oh happy day (oh happy day)
Oh happy day (oh happy day)
Oh happy day (oh happy day)",Oh Happy Day
BeBe Winans,"You won my heart, right from the start 
And it occurred to me, 
I would be lost without your tenderness 
Such sweet caress, and still none the less 
I cannot live without you 

[Chorus]
I'm so glad about it and I know it shows 
Positive about it, that I'm so in love 
Nothing's wrong about it, heart truly knows 
Gonna tell the world about it, 
That I'm so in love with you 

Every time I think of you 
I'm reminded of the special day we met 
When all the world began to sing such sweet harmony 
For all the love you bring 
Oh, each day that passes by offers something new 
Another reason why to fall in love with you 
So what more can I do? 

[Chorus]

We know it's true 
I'm in love with you 
Yes I am 
And it's good to know 
That you feel the same way, same way too 

[Chorus]",So in Love

BeBe Winans,"All I wanted was to be loved
No one deserves to be alone
Accused for taking love for granted
But now I see
If I don't share the way I feel
How can you know?
I found a way to let it show

[Chorus]
I felt by writing this song
It would reveal all my heart
And tell you the way that I'm feeling
I feel like telling you how much I love you so

No special reason, just thought you should know
When those dark clouds arrive to harm me
I don't get afraid, I give you a call
For all that you do
I just want to thank you
If I don't share the way I feel
How can you know?
Now and forever let it show

[Chorus]

Said I thought you should know
This is coming from my heart
Thought you should know
That I'll never ever part
Thought you should know
That it was love from the start
If I don't share the way I feel
How can you know?
I found a way to let it show

[Chorus]",This Song
BeBe Winans,"Took some time to come around
Realize how I let you down
Been too late for sorry now
My pride got in the way
Yes it did

I thought I had it all figured out
I needed time away to work it out
And now that I've learned what it's all about
And all I need is you in my life

So I'm coming back home
Home, where love is waiting for me
Been gone much too long
This is where I want to be
So I'm coming home
Coming home
'Cause home is where I belong

Somehow I lost my way
Mistakes I made I have to pay
It hurts to know still today
That I wasted so much time

And after all is said and done
There's more to life than having fun
Ain't no doubt, you're the one
And all I need is you in my life

So I'm coming back home
Home, where love is waiting for me
Been gone much too long
This is where I want to be
So I'm coming home
Coming home
'Cause home is where I belong

Just to be in your arms is like heaven to me
Your love, your love is all that I need
So I'm coming back home
And I hope you forgive all my wrong
So I'm coming home, coming home
'Cause home is where I belong

So I'm coming back home
Home, where love is waiting for me
Been gone much too long
This is where I want to be
So I'm coming home
Coming home
'Cause home is where I belong",Coming Back Home
