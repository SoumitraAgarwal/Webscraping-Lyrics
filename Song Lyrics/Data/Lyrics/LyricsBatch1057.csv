Ay!

Black prophet, ya better believe, born to stop it
Yes I was, asalaam alaikum, not sayin I'm no apostle
Sometimes I pack a pistol, revolution calls
Ya better believe, from Mecca to Watts I'm speakin to all of, y'all
This (?? ??) will be the Final Call
So listen now, if you will sit back and let me speak the truth
Verbal in your wisdom, amounts to sayin nothin troop
Revolution calls, so pick up the gun it's on the run
Hip-Hop here, Africa here, now some live in fear
No fear, I clean myself don't put my backpack on the shelf
so's I can feed myself..
So follow me now, supposedly, we walk the road of bein free
Take it personal G, I'm speakin the truth and bitin the fruits
Drop the seeds get off your knees, don't be beggin Allah for mercy
Allah God, ain't no time for false prophets
Pullin metaphors out my pocket, I need to stop it
Grab the snake, by his head, make sure when you passin through
Ya best believe, from Mecca to Watts, I'm speakin to all of, you
Tell me revolution didn't come true, in ninety-two
I took 'em down from Western, to Slausson, along with you
Hypocrite no liar, I didn't burn 'em down for nuttin
From Mecca to Watts you best believe though, show yo' face
Unless you holdin up the place, be movin on
Revelation come, I won't be singin no song
Tryin to push no mountin, or bathin in no fountain
Move them apples out my face I coulda sworn I drank 'em down
Not tryin to be profound hysteria (?) I'm bringin 'em down
Still some, they hide behind the cross, now who's the boss?
Just because I meditate, doesn't mean I think I'm great
The devil, you're meddlin with my fate, nope we're not too late
Drop them on your left and, pick up your right arm
I-S-L-A-M don't think I'm slangin Islam
My people, they're witnesses the strongest in the belly of the beast
I say pack a piece, (?) just don't give me no grief
To say the least, now Jeffrey Dahmer had a piece
I step on the scene, friction (?) so you can see me
You know what I mean, tell-lie-vision will deceive you
At the age of three, you'll never be no good nigga
And I suppose you believe the devil
How you figure revolution comes
You better believe I'm pullin the trigger
Some sit back, and they choose to be rememberin
I'm stompin in my Timberlands, I'm comin at ya
African, marketplace, nod or sing or show my face
Reminiscin on, how we used to be, huggin and kissin
Now we con-dit-ioned
So follow me now, supposedly, we walk the road of bein free
Spiritual acceptance, inside your residence
Lookin inside yourself, somethin what's on your mind
Now that we're ropin and copin on the straight and narrow path
Don't be, hidin behind no superficial laughs
I guess I'm drinkin dirty water can't afford no Evian
From Mecca to Watts you best believe the revolution's on
Elijah Muhammad said, that many of us are soon to rise
Blue sky high-rises open up your eyelids
And realize, you're a gift kid by finger usin
That some of the words, that I speak, nope I'm not abusin

Quando ti sento e metto giù mi dico di non farlo più
E anche se restare su whatsapp per dirci le stesse
Vecchie cose che sappiamo già
Per ore e ore
Tanto ormai lo so che I baci che tu chiedi
Non sono I miei
Il rumore dei tuoi passi è già lontano io ti sto chiamando dove sei?

Mentre sembra che il mio mondo stia crollando su di me
Tu adesso dove sei?
Mentre io continuo a dire
No vedi che ormai non c'è
Mi chiedo dove sei
Mentre vedo le mie mani muoversi nel buio su di lei
Mentre ballo con il tuo fantasma dimmi dove sei!

Ei ricordo come mi sentivo sai
Già dalla prima e vai
Volevo sempre averti da stringere
Sempre vicina a me
Tutte quelle cose che a dirsele
Sembrava inutile
Invece adesso riempiono le pagine
Di questo libro di ricordi che
Continuo a scrivere
Fino a che mi resta un po' da vivere

Se ti avessi qui davanti forse ti direi
Gli sbagli che io ho fatto non li rifarei
Le cose che poi ti hanno delusa
Una porta è chiusa
Io non so decidere
Ma non si cancella anche se vuoi
Quello che è stato fra di noi
I sogni mordono la polvere
Lasciando il posto alle domande a cui nessuno sa rispondere

Dove sei
Mentre sembra che il mio mondo stia crollando su di me
Tu adesso dove sei?
Mentre io continuo a dire
No vedi che ormai non c'è
Mi chiedo dove sei
Mentre vedo le mie mani muoversi nel buio su di lei
Mentre ballo con il tuo fantasma dimmi dove sei!

Mentre sembra che il mio mondo stia crollando su di me

결과는 반대
하나 둘 팬들이 더 쌓여갈 때

아직도 빛나는 그 애들처럼

Negative Space,"We starve, look at one another short of breath
Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

Negative Space,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

This announcement from the producers of this record contains
Important information for radio program directors, and is not for broadcast.
The first cut on this record has been cross-format-focused for
Airplay success. As you well know, a record must break on radio in order to
Actually provide a living for the artists involved. Up until now, you've
Had to make these record-breaking decisions on your own, relying only on
Perplexing intangibilities like taste and intuition.
But now, there's a better way.
The cut that follows is the product of newly-developed
Compositional techniques, based on state-of-the-art marketing analysis
Technology. This cut has been analytically designed to break on radio. And
It will, sooner or later.
For the station that breaks it first, the benefits are obvious. You
Lead the pack. Yes, no matter what share of this crazy market you do
Business in, no other release is going to satisfy your corporation's
Current idea of good radio like this one. On this cut, we're working
Together, on the same wavelength, in scientific harmony.
But remember, this cut is const
Ructed for multi-market-breaking
NOW. Don't waste valuable research with needless delay. We've done the hard
Work of insuring your success; the final step is up to you.

Hi! I'm Candy Jo, and I'm shooting the Ingram M-10, or the Mac-10!
GUNS.
This gun is one of the most well-known machine guns in the world,
(GUNS.) not only because it has been featured in numerous Hollywood movies,
(GUNS.) but also because it has derived underworld popularity. (GUNS.)
The Mac-10 is the weapon of choice because of its concealability. (GUNS.)
With this gun, even I could stop most of the bad guys out there.
GUNS.
As you 
Can see, this gun is really fast! (GUNS.) It fires a 9
Millimeter round at a rate of 1200 rounds per minute! (GUNS.) That's, like,
20 shots per second! (GUNS.)
Not only that, it weighs just six and a quarter pounds, and it's
Only ten and a half inches long. (GUNS.)
Hello, my name is Julie, and this is the M-16. (GUNS.)
I'm shooting the MPK submachine gun. It's made in Germany, (GUNS.)
The MP stands for Machine Pistol. (THIS is a real gun.) This gun fires a 9
Millimeter cartridge at a rate of 550 rounds per minute. (GUNS.) That's
Close to 10 rounds per second!
(""they're no more difficult to operate than
A household appliance"")
What surprises me is how easy this gun is to handle. (GUNS.) I
Guess that's what makes it so much fun! (GUNS.)
The barrel on th
E MPK is six inches long, and I'm shooting it with
A 30-round magazine. (GUNS.) It weighs just six and a half pounds, (GUNS.)
And has a clever folding wire stock. (GUNS.) Those Germans really know how
To make a machine gun! (GUNS.)
Now THIS is a real gun.
 Not one of those wimpy submachine guns.
I mean, I've never fired a gun before in my life! (GUNS.) But let
Me tell you, once I got that machine gun in my hands, there was no stopping
Me! (GUNS.) It's a blast! I love it! (What a blast!)
It's a blast!
It'
S a blast!
It's a blast!
(""Whew, THAT was a blast..."")
""Well, we started out telling a little history, why'know, with a
Little music like 'Annie get Your Gun' and a pioneer-dressed woman... and
The story line developing through the, um, the dance hall girl who had
To... protect herself in various ways... all of these having various
Concealed firearms... then into the contemporary business woman in a
Business suit... uh, the recreational woman... a police officer... (we know
Criminals will always get guns) the, uh, security guard... and finishing

Where do you 
Conceal the gun in a bikini?""

(Yeah!) much less a machine gun! (Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!) (GUNS. GUNS.)
Hi there! My name is Lisa, and this is the H & K G-3. (This is

Uh... exhibited, about 90% of the people never even saw it, or where it

Hello, I'm Tish. I'm shooting the Thompson submachine gun (GUNS.)
Hi, how are ya? I'm Denise, from San Diego, California, and I'm
Gonna show you how to shoot the AK-47 automatic rifle, (GUNS.) the standard
Issue to the Soviet Bloc Army, I might add! (It's a BIG gun!)
This gun weighs nine pounds, seven ounces, and fires 600 rounds per
Minute. (GUNS.)
The fifty round drum is a lot of fun, because you can just shoot,
And just keep on shooting! (GUNS. GUNS. GUNS. GUNS.)
(Whew! Blew the other window out!)
""..have the shoulder holster, then the standard hip holster, and
Uh, waistband holsters...""

My name is Adrian. How are you doing today? (GUNS.)
I'm shooting the world-famous Uzi submachine gun. (GUNS.)
I can just imagine stopping a group of terrorists in their tracks with this
Magnificent weapon. (GUNS.)
The Uzi is a bit heavy at seven and a half pounds, (GUNS. GUNS.)
But.. that gives it some heft and something to hang on to! (GUNS. GUNS.)
There's something about having a gun in your hands, and being able to
Control it, (GUNS.) I don't know what it is, but all the girls talked about
It...
(Anytime YOU want to go shooting, just give me a call)
""What's next?""
I really don't know anything about guns, but when the producer said
I was going to be shooting the Uzi, I immediately recognized it as the gun
The Presidential Secret Service men carry under their coats!
""What's next? Do the firearms themselves come in, uh, fashion
Colors?""
""Well, believe it or not...""

Se eu ficar na pior, ao menos eu tentei, eu tentei!
Está dento de mim, coragem pra seguir,
Haja o que houver minha voz vai ecoar,
Não penso em desistir, não ouso me calar, pois

Ninguém pode me impedir de falar
Ninguém pode me impedir de fazer
Ninguém pode me impedir de ser

Se eu me preocupar com o que vão dizer
Estou certo do que tem melhor pra te oferecer
E na busca incansável de quem sabe o que quer
Desafio, barreira, panela, funil, isso é o que é
Tudo isso já está na nossa conta
Só que felizmente nada disso mais me desaponta
E continuo forte, seguindo em frente
Sem roer a corda, constante, pra frente!

Eu sei que o tempo não volta,
E eu não quero ter que esperar
Pra mim é isso que importa,
Nunca me deixar levar
E não vou mas me iludir
Sei o que quero pra mim
Vou cantar,brilhar,sonhar
Porque tenta não custa nada",Ninguém Pode Me Impedir

Che non ero bambino
Che non ero neanche un' età
Quando un giorno di scuola
Mi durava una vita
E il mio mondo finiva un po là
Tra quel prete palloso
Che ci dava da fare
E il pallone che andava
Come fosse a motore
C'era chi era incapace a sognare
E chi sognava già
Ho imparato a sognare
E ho iniziato a sperare
Che chi c'ha avere avrà

Quando un sogno è un cannone,
Che se sogni
Ne ammazzi metà
Quando inizi a capire
Che sei solo e in mutande
Quando inizi a capire
Che tutto è più grande
C' era chi era incapace a sognare
E chi sognava già

Tra una botta che prendo
E una botta che dò
Tra un amico che perdo
E un amico che avrò
Che se cado una volta
Una volta cadrò
E da terra, da lì m'alzerò

C'è che ormai che ho imparato a sognare non smetterò

Ho imparato a sognare,
Quando inizi a scoprire
Che ogni sogno
Ti porta più in là
Cavalcando aquiloni,
Oltre muri e confini
Ho imparato a sognare da là
Quando tutte le scuse,
Per giocare son buone
Quando tutta la vita
È una bella canzone
C'era chi era incapace a sognare
E chi sognava già

When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way,
""Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way""

Tu meritavi di più,ma adesso shock!
Al rientro da uno spot, abiti dentro a una favela
finita l'era di hell dorado, nel piano b tu non sei convocato.

E canta d'amore la radio, amore per chi?
Le rock star vestono chic, e il vetro è sempre più oscurato
Ma nell'arena s'alza un canto
niente paura qui va tutto bene!

E' in onda radio conga dal centro della jungla
C'è qualcuno là sopra? (may-day, may-day!)
No victoria ma vana gloria(and the party is over)

Olèlè olèlè malibà ma'ka'si,

Olèlè olèlè mimi nakupenda wewe

Ora tu ti chiedi chi sei? cosa farai?
Piangi stretto al tuo bonsai,
Mentre intorno avanza il fuoco!

Le certezze di una vita via!
Come acqua tra le dita!
Ma se senti che non sei solo anche se il cielo è scuro,
Cerca un raggio e prendi il volo
Sopra 'sto mondo sperando
Che in hell dorado sei quello che hai ma, non ti basta mai!

E' in onda radio conga dal centro della jungla
C'è qualcuno là sopra? (may-day, may-day!)
No victoria ma vana gloria (and the party is over)

Se c'è tensione si cura con gli idranti
qualcuno muore pazienza siamo in tanti
tragico errore spariscono le provee la prigione è solo per chi ruba polli.
Lavoro nero pagato con denaro
Neronera la rabbia nera la stagione nera la fame nera la rivoluzione
L'africa nera è solo a 4 passi di qui!

L'umore nero si cura con il bianco
Cura la bamba come l'aspirinae balla di bamba pure la velina,
Icona d'ossa pelle e silicone.
Il calciatore dice che il pallone
È tondoil presidente giura di cambiare il mondo
Nessun futuro nel mio futuro!
Nessun futuro nel mio futuro!

C'è qualcuno là sopra? (may-day, may-day!)

Negrita,"Persi nella nuvola blu
Della gioventù
Le mie mani sulle tue
Ed il cielo dentro agli occhi.
Il pieno nel piazzale di un bar, la strada che va
L’incoscienza dell’età
Volevamo solo andare via

Il vento alza un odore di mare
Di polvere e sale
Sulla via per Marracash
Ballavamo a piedi nudi
Giorni di velluto e poesie
Disastri e Utopie
A Berlino tutto ok
Mentre il Muro andava in briciole!

E mi sto innamorando

E il mondo sta Cambiando!

E tu col tuo vestito di fiori
Sembravi una diva
Per le strade di Montmartre
Era ancora primavera
Nell’autoradio Punk e New wawe
Il boss e Tom Waits
Cantavamo a squarciagola
Con il cuore in piazza Tienanmen

Al suo sogno artificiale
Una doccia profumata
Segue guerra con lo specchio
E la scarpa, quella giusta
Per poi dare un po' nell'occhio
E' già il terzo aperitivo
E sembra ancora una tisana
Preludio all’agonia
Del fine settimana

Esce musica fetente
Dalla porta di un locale
E scosciate reginette
Che si affannano ad entrare
Gambe lunghe come aironi
Trasparenti da digiuno
Affonderanno i tacchi a spillo
Dentro i sogni di qualcuno
E' una notte di movida
E folli desideri sparsi
Che la vita è troppo breve, amore
Per accontentarsi

Ragnatele di tubi al Neon
Luci gialle a Incandescenza
Sotto un cielo Rosso-Viola
Che trasuda incoscienza
C'è uno spacciatore nero
Che alza più di una Puttana
Sul suo marciapiede stretto
C'è una lunga fila indiana
Esce un tipo allucinato
Dalla Metropolitana
Lui stanotte si è imbiancato sì
Con una cerbottana!

Dal terrazzo al terzo piano

Che sta urlando io vi ammazzo
Credo almeno da mezz'ora
Vorrei dirle che ha ragione

Non è forse un po' morire

Chasing beats through ghetto streets
To a dungeonous temple left by our soul descendants
In a quest for peace, energy and light.

Do you have the knowledge to enter the temple?
Do you want it?

Deserve.

Neil Andersson,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Everybody look what's going down 

There's battle lines being drawn 
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong 
Young people speaking their minds 
Getting so much resistance from behind 

It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 

What a field-day for the heat 
A thousand people in the street 
Singing songs and carrying signs 
Mostly say, hooray for our side 

It's s time we stop, hey, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 

Paranoia strikes deep 
Into your life it will creep 
It starts when you're always afraid 
You step out of line, the man come and take you away 

We better stop, hey, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 
Stop, hey, what's that sound

And when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad I'm a man

An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Hurrying to get there
Ninety miles an hour
In two Plymouth wagons
The Avis lady gave us a smile
Tom's getting uptight
Max'll will make it all right
Ken's asleep in back
Artie's reading a map
That's takin' us where we're heading to
We should be there soon
There's a sign up ahead
Wash my face and get fed
And that voice in my head
Keeps sayin' I'm lonely
But I'm only payin' my dues

Had a reservation, best accommodations
We get the word, they never heard
We were comin' by at all
See what they can do for me
Only got one room free
Little bit confined
But if you guys don't mind
We'll put you up in our bridal suite
The view can't be beat
And a fine view they got
Of a new parking lot
And I can't repeat what's in my mind
As I lay back resigned
And I kick off my shoes

Time to put a show on
Gettin' time to go on
People call for more
We do two encores
Take our bows and we're feelin' fine
We got to unwind

This town closes at ten
Looks like I'm gonna spend
One more night by the light
Of the late show

Saying nothing, lying where the sun is
Baking down upon our sides
My lips touch you, with their soft wet kisses
Your hands gentle in reply
And the time will be our time
And the grass won't pay no mind

Child, touch my soul with your cries
And the music will know what we've found
I, hear a hundred good-byes
But today I hear only one sound
The moment we're living is now
Now now now now now now now

Young bird flying, and a soft wind blowing
Cools the sweat inside my palms
Close my eyes, hear the flowers growing
As you lay sleeping in my arms
And the time will be our time

Cryin' in your pretzels
Cryin' in your beer

That's where I found you dear

Yes, my sweet I came into that bar
It was in Mississippi
There you were, sitting in the corner
Crying in your pretzels
You'd already sogged up
A whole plate of potato chips
But the management didn't mind
Because you were a regular customer

And I saw you sittin' there and I said
""That person needs a friend,
And I'm gonna be a friend
Ain't nobody deserves to cry in his pretzels
All night and wash away the salt.""

""What can I do for you? How can I help you?
What can I do to ease the pain?""

Cross the space that lies between us;
Cast the stones of fortune,
For the journey has begun, yes it has begun.

So you do, so you want to be giving.
Say it out loud if you need to be holy.
So you do, so you want to be loving;
Say it out now if you need to be holier still. 

So it seems or so it may be, 
I can't know for sure but lately seems I'm on a journey
To a place I've never been.
And baby if I had the answers I would lay them all before you;
Plainly it's a circle, one that ends and then begins, and begins again. 
Yes I will, 'deed I will. If I can.",Yes I Will
Neil Diamond,"Captain Sunshine, make me drink wine,

Neil Diamond,"What a beautiful noise
Comin' up from the street
Got a beautiful sound
It's got a beautiful beat

It's a beautiful noise
Goin' on everywhere
Like the clickety-clack
Of a train on a track
It's got a rhythm to spare

It's a beautiful noise
And it's sound that I love
And it's fit me as well
As a hand in a glove
Yes it does, yes it does

What a beautiful noise
Comin' up from the park
It's the song of the kids
And it plays until dark

It's the song of the cars
On their furious flights
But there's even romance
In the way that they dance
To beat of the lights

It's a beautiful noise
And it's a sound that I love
And it makes me feel good
Like a hand in a glove
Yes it does, yes it does
What a beautiful noise

It's a beautiful noise
Made of joy an of strife
Like a symphony played
By a passing parade
It's the music of life

What a beautiful noise
Comin' up to my room
And it's beggin' for me
Just to give it a tune",Beautiful Noise
Neil Diamond,"Sleepy old sun, sleepy old day, 
Sleepy old tree gonna make me some shade.
Sleepy old time on my side of town, 
I'm feelin' fine, I'll explain to you now.
Don't think, feel; ain't no big deal.
Just make it real and don't think, feel.
It don't take plans to clap your hands,
When it feels nice just don't think twice. 
Some worry all day 'bout who they can trust, 
Some worry all night 'bout money and lust.
Worry they do and worried they die--
And after they're gone just the bankers cry.
Don't think, feel; ain't no big deal.
Just make it real and don't think, feel.
It don't take plans to clap your hands,
When it feels nice just don't think twice.
Life is a card, you take what you get.
You do what you can to feel no regret.
You do what you can, forget about words, 
Just go with the feelin' it usually works.
Don't think, feel; ain't no big deal.
Just make it real and don't think, feel.
It don't take plans to clap your hands,
When it feels nice you don't think twice.

Neil Diamond,"Dry your eyes and take your song out, it's a newborn afternoon.
And if you can't recall the singer you can still recall the tune.
Dry your eyes and play it slowly like you're marching off to war;
Sing it like you know he'd want it, like we sang it once before.
And from the center of the circle to the midst of the waiting crowd,
If it ever be forgotten sing it long and sing it loud and come dry your eyes.

And he taught us more about giving than we ever cared to know,
But we came to find the secret and we never let it go.
And it was more than being holy and it was less than being free,
And if you can't recall the reason can you hear the people sing.
Right through the lightning and the thunder to the dark side of the moon,
To that distant falling angel that descended much too soon
And come dry your eyes.

Come dry your eyes.",Dry Your Eyes
Neil Diamond,"Home is a wounded heart, haven't you heard the story?
He's out for love and for glory and she's waitin' home by the fire.
And wasn't it yesterday, wasn't it me who said it?
I swore that you'd never regret it.
Now home is a wounded heart.
It's a complicated thing, not an ordinary thing
And my heart just breaks in two 
'Cause I can see you standing there. 
You know that I can't bear your wounded heart.
Paint me a red balloon; give me a string and baby I'll tie it,
Give me a ring and baby I'll buy it and bring it on home to you.
Home is a wounded heart.",Home Is a Wounded Heart
Neil Diamond,"When the night returns just like a friend
When the evening comes to set me free
When the quiet house that wait beyond the day
Make peaceful sounds in me

Took a drink from a glass of old wine
I closed my eyes, and I could make it real
And feel it one more time

Can you hear it, babe
From another time
From another place

And here's to the times we used to know
It's hard to hold them in our arms again

Echoes just beneath the heart

And half forgotten play their part.

Left behind for our keeping, signs.

Sail along, sail along in search of a star that you can hold.

And of river queens of paupers and of men with means,

You'll be my reason, and I'll be yours

Well, I'm the boy they stood in line for
Have you got just a little time for me tonight
I'll make you feel alright
Hey do you remember me

Remember me
The world was ours for just one evening
Felt so warm, it's hard believing
That it would end
And here we are again
Hey do you remember me

Remember now
Music filled the empty spaces
And took us off to distant places
We'd never seen
Do you remember now
I still got my song and I can sing it
My guitar plays beneath my fingers
Warm, baby warm, baby warm
Say, do you remember me

Well, I'm the boy you gave your heart to
Don't you think we've been apart too long this time
But you've been on my mind

Neil Diamond,"You don't bring me flowers
You don't sing me love songs
You hardly talk to me anymore
When I come through the door at the end of the day

I remember when
You couldn't wait to love me
Used to hate to leave me
Now after lovin' me late at night

When it's good for you, babe
And you're feeling alright

Well, you just roll over
And you turn out the light
And you don't bring me flowers anymore

It used to be so natural (Used to be)
To talk about forever
But used-to-be's don't count anymore
They just lay on the floor 'til we sweep them away

And baby, I remember
All the things you taught me

I learned how to laugh
And I learned how to cry

Well I learned how to love
And I learned how to lie

So you'd think I could learn
How to tell you goodbye

You don't bring me flowers anymore

Well, you'd think I could learn
How to tell you goodbye

You don't sing to me

And you don't sing me love songs

You've got your troubles, I've got mine
She's found somebody else to take your place
You've got your troubles, I've got mine

I too have lost my love today
All of my dreams have flown away

Now just like you, I sit and wonder why
You've got your troubles, I've got mine
You need some sympathy, well so do I
You've got your troubles, I've got mine

She used to love me, that I know
And it don't seem so long ago

That we were walking
And we were talking
The way that lovers do

I too have lost my love today
All of my dreams have flown away

And so forgive me if I seem unkind (I ain't got no pity for you)
You've got your troubles, I've got mine (I lost, I lost, I lost my little girl

Life is kind, can you see it?
Love is great, love is right, 
Keeps you warm late at night when you need it. 
Baby boy, daddy's joy, life's a toy, 
But you don't want to break it. 
Like a sweet symphony, all you need is the key, you can play it. 
Gitchy goomy, gitchy gaddy, sit you laddie down while I have my say,
Now don't be runnin' away.
Goggin noggin, papa's talkin' 
Don't go walkin' off like you mean to play, 
Well, you can have it your way.
Been there one time, been there two times, 
Been there three times more than I care to say,
But you're gonna be O.K. Gitchy Goomy.

Seen it one time, seen it two times, 
Seen it three times, Lord 'n' it's plain to see.

You 'n' me gonna make it through Gitchy Goomy.
Ah, you gonna make it through Gitchy Goomy.",Gitchy Goomy
Neil Diamond,"The road is long
With many a winding turn
That leads us to who knows where
Who knows when

But I'm strong
Strong enough to carry him
He ain't heavy, he's my brother
So on we go

His welfare is of my concern
No burden is he to bear
We'll get there
For I know

He would not encumber me
He ain't heavy, he's my brother
If I'm laden at all
I'm laden with sadness

That everyone's heart
Isn't filled with the gladness
Of love for one another
It's a long, long road

From which there is no return
While we're on the way to there
Why not share
And the load

Doesn't weigh me down at all

He's my brother

Neil Diamond,"Morningside
The old man died
And no one cried
They simply turned away
And when he died
He left a table made of nails and pride
And with his hands he carved these words inside
""For my children""

Morning light
Morning bright
I spent the night
With dreams that make you weep
Morning time
Wash away the sadness from these eyes of mine
For I recall the words the old man signed
""For my children""

And the legs were shaped with his hands
And the top made of oaken wood
And the children sat around this great table
Touched with their laughter
Ah, and that was good

Morningside
An old man died
And no one cried
He surely died alone
And truth is sad
For not a child would claim the gift he had
The words he carved became his epitath
""For my children""",Morningside

Neil Diamond,"Rolls and flows of angel hair
Ice cream castles in the air
Feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way
But now they only block the sun
They rain, they snow on everyone
So many things I would've done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's clouds' illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy, dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show
Leave 'em laughin' when you go
But if you care, don't let em' know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
Say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way
But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads and say I've changed
But something's lost when somethings gained
Living everyday

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all",Both Sides Now
Neil Diamond,"One, knowing I'm one, hearing of two
And like a child believing dreams
Always a dream to take you home

There comes the knowing when you laugh

The night alone will hear
And the night don't care

Take off your nighttime shoes

I've been waiting so long for you

Neil Diamond,"If you go away on this summer day
Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in a summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
When the day was young and the night was lo-ong
And the moon stood still for the night birds song
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away

But if you stay I'll make you a day
Like no day has been or will be again
We'll sail on the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go-o I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away

If you go away as I know you must
There'll be nothin' left in the world to trust
Just an empty room full of empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face 
Can I tell you now as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly till your next hello
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away

But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes that I-I love so much
But if you go, I won't cry
For the good's gone from goodbye

Are you going away?
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace
Left behind.
Well I could have loved you better
I didn't mean to be unkind
You know, that was the last thing on my mind

Echoing through painted smiles
And I knew each morning after
I never loved, was never touched
Gave not at all, got back as much
In the co-o-omfort of
A modern day version of lo-o-ove

Truly, how I've cursed the sweet taste
Of lips that ask so-o much of me
Still I wonder with every embrace
Could I give, and not break
Should I care, and forsake
All the co-o-omfort of
A modern day version of lo-o-ove

Close my eyes and keep on runnin'
Realise it isn't gonna work anymor-ore
For me, yeah-eah
I'm afraid, well maybe that's somethin'
Never cared enough to be afraid of anything
Before, not before ...

Neil Diamond,"She was moring
And I was night time
I one day woke up
To find her lying
Beside my bed
I softly said
""Come take me""
For I've been lonely
In need of someone
As though I'd done
Someone wrong somewhere
I don't know where
Come lately

You are the sun
I am the moon
You are the words
I am the tune
Play me

Song she sang to me
Song she brang to me
Words that rang in me
Rhyme that sprang from me
Warmed the night
And what was right
Became me

You are the sun
I am the moon
You are the words
I am the tune
Play me

And so it was
That I came to travel
Upon a road
That was thorned and narrow
Another place
Another grace
Would save me

You are the sun
I am the moon
You are the word
I am the tune

Neil Diamond,"Suzanne takes you dow-own 
To her place by the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night forever
And you know the girl's half-crazy
That's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges 
That come all the way from China
And just when you want to tell her 
That you have no love to give her
She gets you on her wavelength 
And lets the river answer 
That you've always been her lover-er

And Jesus was a sailor 
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watchin' 
From a lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain 
Only-why drownin' men could see him
He said all men are sailors, then
Until the sea shall free them
Bu-ut he, himself, was broken
Long before the sky would ope-en
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a sto-o-one

And you want to travel with him
Ahh you want to travel bli-ind
And you-ou think that you might trust him 
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind

Suzanne takes you down 
To her place by the river
And you can hear the boats that go by
You can spend the night forever
And the sun pours down like honey 
On Ou-our Lady of the Harbor
And she shows you where to look 
Amid the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morni-ing
They are leanin' out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds her mirror",Suzanne

I'm a man who's divided
And one night
Burning hot with a kiss and I try to resist
But there's no way to fight it

Hey, can anybody save me, save me
Save me from the storm
Save me, save me
Save me, 'fore I'm gone

And a man's gotta break
There's a lot who can stand
But not a lot who can take

Won't you save me

It's breaking me up inside

And it never made a sound
So we never ran for cover
And it blew the house down
And it brought us together
Maybe tore us all apart

Yeah, that's how I feel
When I look in your eyes,
I feel primitive
Uncivilized
Like something
From out of the heart of the jungle,
Uncivilized
Foolish mind
Believing that passion
Is somehow a rational thing at all
And that's when you take that fall
I'm livin' my life
In such a primitive way
I was doing alright before you came
I said okay,
You said okay, it's okay
Tentative
There's nothing about you
That's even the slightest bit tentative
But you remain,
Still you're a woman
And yet in a way representative
Of woman kind,
Believin' the notion
That love and devotion will rise again
Why can't we just be friends
I'm living my life in such a primitive way
I was doing alright before you came
I said okay,
It's okay, it's okay
Just look at me
Feel like a river of quivering jelly,
No man at all
'Cause no man would take that fall
I'm living my life in such a primitive way
I was doing alright before you came
I'm living my life in a primitive way
Yeah,
I was doing alright before you came
I'm living my life in a primitive way
Yeah, I was doing just fine
Before you came",Primitive
Neil Diamond,"Something in your eyes tonight
Told me to stay
It's been so long,
But to see you this way

Makes me want to hold you
Tell you that I'm sorry
Tell you that I need to
Be with you tonight

Baby, won't you let me in
We tried it apart
But here we are together again
Makes me know I've missed you

Makes me know I need you
Tell you how I want to
Be with you tonight
And now I finally understand

How much I've missed
You loved me once
Please, love me once again
Can I sleep with you tonight?

Let's try it again
For one last time for the rest of our lives
Baby, be forgiving
What's been done is done now

Let's you and me be one
Come, sleep with me tonight

Where do you think you're going
We've been through this door so many times
Just turn around,

In better times

Can't you see, I'll be there for you

Turn around,
Don't turn away, babe

Neil Diamond,"I think of you now and then
Cause I remember when
Love was new and you were mine
My love

So why should we pretend
We were lovers but now we're friends
Don't want to say good-bye to you again
My love

[Chorus]
It should have been me
That's holding you instead of someone else
I needed you but never let it show
It should have been me
That's loving you
Through all the lonely nights
I knew that I should have never let you go
My love

What we once had is gone
No tears, no right, no wrong
We could never be the same again
My love

The more we see the less we know
You still believe our love could grow
Don't want to say good-bye to you again

How will I survive
With another broken heart
On my own again
Just a lonely man
Looking for a place to start

My love",It Should Have Been Me
Neil Diamond,"I get up in the morning and I go to work.
I try to keep busy but I feel the hurt.
I see you around me everywhere I turn,
But you're gone - lost in Hollywood.

You got up one morning,
Said you had to go.
You would've gone
Even if I told you ""no.""
And all I could say was,
""Baby just take it slow,
You take care,
Don't get lost in Hollywood.""

You had your dream, you had to find it.
I begged you, ""Girl, please don't go.""
Now when I call to find if you're in,
The answer always is ""no.""

You had to make it on your own,
Just had to do it all alone for a while.
Was not a lot that I could say.
You had to have it your own way,
I suppose.
Like some river that flows to the sea.

And I should've known,
That in time you would be leaving me,
Leaving me.

Hey, has anybody seen my girl?
She's lost in Hollywood.

Hey, has anybody seen my girl?
She's lost in Hollywood.

I get home in the evening,
But I just can't sleep.
I lay on your pillow,
And I feel your heat.
And everything here
Just keeps on reminding me
That you're gone - lost in Hollywood.

I walk the streets, it sounds of laughter,
But I hear only the pain.
The morning comes,
The sunshine greets me,
But I feel only the rain.

But something gets me through the day,
Something in my heart keeps saying to me,
I just know you can't be far away.
When you come home
Everything's going to work out okay,
Okay.

Hey, has anybody seen my girl?
She's lost in Hollywood.

Hey, has anybody seen my girl?
She's lost in Hollywood.

If you know where to find her,
Then kindly remind her.
While searching for finer,
She's left love behind her,
Yeah.

Hey, has anybody seen my girl?
She's lost in Hollywood.

Hey, has anybody seen my girl?
She's lost in Hollywood.",Lost in Hollywood
Neil Diamond,"How can I stay in this place
All that I see is her face
And every room just seems to haunt me

Why would she throw love away
Guess there's no reason to stay
Maybe it's time to close the door

Love it doesn't live here anymore
Why can't it be like before
I know that she still wants me
Tell me why, why did she have to go

I thought our love would go on
But somehow she knew all along
That we could never find an answer

Putting an end to our plans
Leaving my heart in my hands
Saying goodbye is such a chore

[Chorus]

And we had something,
There can be no doubt
Now there's nothing left to talk about
She's the one thing I can't live without
How can I leave it all behind

And how could she throw love away
Guess there's no reason to stay
Maybe it's time to close the door

That I would end up losing you this way
As far as I could see
The life we had was always gonna stay
And I tried to be
The man you need

I'll never understand
What I expected out of loving you
The way we had it planned
There always could be
Room enough for two
To live and grow
How could I know
I wouldn't be the man you need

And I wanna know why
Yeah, I wanna know how
Say I wanna know where
Everything went wrong
And I'm sorry, 'cause I love you

You told me more than once
I never understood my way around
The way that things worked out
I'm still not really sure
Of where I'm bound
You knew me well
I should have seen
I couldn't be the man you need

And I reach for the sky
I reach for the stars
And all of the time
I was reaching for you
And I'm sorry, 'cause I love you

Say it now again
I'm holdin' on
I've only just begun
To learn the meaning of not having you

You need forever more

That I would be the man
You need forever more
I want to be the man
You need forever more",The Man You Need

I can see you
All through the night

Close my eyes and
I see you coming back to me
Wonder, could it be that way again

Is very plain to read
It starts the day you came
It ends the day you leave

The story of my life
Begins and ends with you
The names are still the same
The story's still the truth

I was alone
You found me waiting
And made me your own
I was afraid
That somehow I never could be
The man that you wanted of me

You're the story of my life
And every word is true
Each chapter sings your name
Each page begins with you

It's the story of our times

And if I die today
I wanted you to know

Stay with me
Share with me
Care with me 
Stay and be near

I'd lie awake every night

Neil Diamond,"There was a time when girls were kind
When their voices were soft
And their words inviting
There was a time when love was blind

And the world was a song
And the song was exciting
There was a time
It all went wrong

I dreamed a dream of time gone by
When hope was high
And life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving

When I was young and unafraid
When dreams were made
And used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid

No song unsung, no wine un-tasted
But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
And they tear your hope apart

As they turn your dream to shame....
She slept this summer by my side
She filled my days with endless wonder
She took my childhood in her stride

But she was gone when autumn came
And still I dream she'll come to me
That we will spend the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be

And there are storms we cannot weather

So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
But life can't kill

We danced until the night became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes from some romantic play
September morning still can make me feel that way

Why, you've become a grown-up girl

In a corner of your room

So far from where we used to be

The smell of cookin' in the hallways
Rubber drying in the doorways
And report cards I was always
Afraid to show

Mama'd come to school
And as I'd sit there softly crying
Teacher'd say, ""He's just not trying
He's got a good head if he'd apply it""
But you know yourself
It's always somewhere else

I built me a castle
With dragons and kings
And I'd ride off with them
As I stood by my window
And looked out on those
Brooklyn Roads

Thought of going back
But all I'd see are strangers' faces
And all the scars that love erases
But as my mind walks through those places
I'm wonderin'

Come home to my room
Does he dream what I did

Somewhere that's far beyond
Was going no where

Was makin' me tell myself lies

Afraid that she'd read me and
Finally deceive me

Those eyes that smile, I know all the while
I'm courtin' disaster
You call my tune, I just obey it
Was long ago you loved me, I know
I once heard you say it
So I keep going on without ever knowing
All that I need to do
And I know some how,
It's the same way now for you.
And you're courtin' disaster too
I'm not an innocent man
Then you happened my way
Two paths that chanced to cross
One night on some secret highway
Still hear your words
And I believe you meant it
Your voice, that sound, the heat
What's worse, I still can remember
Can I keep going on without ever knowing
All that I need to do
And to know some how
It's the same way now for you
And we're courtin' disaster
Yeah, we're courtin' disaster
I could try to run away
But the feeling just won't set me free
If you need to find me,
You can find me here waiting

That leads us to who knows where
Who knows where

Strong enough to carry him

I'm laden with sadness

Isn't filled with the gladness

Neil Diamond,"L.A.'s fine, the sun shines most the time
And the feeling is ""lay back""
Palm trees grow and rents are low
But you know I keep thinkin' about
Making my way back

Well I'm New York City born and raised
But nowadays
I'm lost between two shores
L.A.'s fine, but it ain't home
New York's home
But it ain't mine no more

""I am""... I said
To no one there
And no one heard at all
Not even the chair

""I am""... I cried
""I am""... said I
And I am lost and I can't
Even say why
Leavin' me lonely still

Did you ever read about a frog
Who dreamed of bein' a king
And then became one
Well except for the names
And a few other changes
If you talk about me
The story is the same one

But I got an emptiness deep inside
And I've tried
But it won't let me go
And I'm not a man who likes to swear
But I never cared
For the sound of being alone

""I am""... I said
To no one there
And no one heard at all
Not even the chair
""I am""... I cried

Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way

He's loaded lots of toys
And goodies on his sleigh
And ev'ry mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeers really know how to fly

For yonder breaks

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away

We've been through it all and you love me just the same
And when your not there
I just need to hear

Hello, my friend, hello
It's good to need you so
It's good to love you like I do

Neil Diamond,"L.A.'s fine, the sun shines most the time
And the feeling is ""lay back""
Palm trees grow and rents are low
But you know I keep thinkin' about
Making my way back

Well I'm New York City born and raised
But nowadays
I'm lost between two shores
L.A.'s fine, but it ain't home
New York's home
But it ain't mine no more

""I am""... I said
To no one there
And no one heard at all
Not even the chair

""I am""... I cried
""I am""... said I
And I am lost and I can't
Even say why
Leavin' me lonely still

Did you ever read about a frog
Who dreamed of bein' a king
And then became one
Well except for the names
And a few other changes
If you talk about me
The story is the same one

But I got an emptiness deep inside
And I've tried
But it won't let me go
And I'm not a man who likes to swear
But I never cared
For the sound of being alone

""I am""... I said
To no one there
And no one heard at all
Not even the chair
""I am""... I cried
""I am""... said I
And I am lost and I can't
Even say why

Neil Diamond,"I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams
 
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
No not if I tried
 
I thought love was more or less a giving thing
Seems the more I gave the less I got
What's the use in tryin'
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain
 
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
Not if I tried

Neil Diamond,"Love on the rocks
Ain't no surprise
Just pour me a drink and I'll tell you some lies
Got nothin' to lose so you just sing the blues
All the time

Gave you my heart
Gave you my soul
You left me alone here with nothing to hold
Yesterday's gone
Now all I want is a smile

First, they say they want you
How they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm
When they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave, just get away
We all know the song

You need what you need
You can say what you want
Not much you can do when the feeling is gone
May be blue skies above
But it's cold when you love's on the rocks

First, they say they want you
How they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm
When they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave, just get away

Neil Diamond,"Red, red wine
Go to my head
Make me forget that I
Still need her so

Red, red wine
It's up to you
All I can do, I've done
But memories won't go
No, memories won't go

I'd have sworn
That with time
Thoughts of you
Would leave my head
I was wrong
And I find
Just one thing
Makes me forget

Red, red wine
Stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearing apart
My blue, blue heart","Red, Red Wine [Live]"
Neil Diamond,"Stay for just a while
Stay and let me look at you
It's been so long, I hardly knew you
Standing in the door

Stay with me a while
I only wanna talk to you
We've traveled halfway 'round the world
To find ourselves again

September morn
We danced until the night
Became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes
From some romantic play
September morning
Still can make me feel that way

Look at what you've done
Why, you've become a grown-up girl
I still can hear you crying
In a corner of your room
And look how far we've come
So far from where we used to be
But not so far that we've forgotten
How it was before

September morn
Do you remember
How we danced that night away
Two lovers playing scenes
From some romantic play
September morning
Still can make me feel that way

September morn
We danced until the night
Became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes
From some romantic play
September morning
Still can make me feel that way

Everybody knows one
Song sung blue

Me and you are subject to the blues now and then
But when you take the blues and make a song
You sing them out again
Sing them out again

Weeping like a willow
Song sung blue
Sleeping on my pillow

Funny thing, but you can sing it with a cry in your voice
And before you know, start to feeling good
You simply got no choice

I've been away so long
I may go wrong and lose my way
Do you know the way to San Jose?

I'm going back
To find some peace of mind

L.A. is a great big freeway

Put a hundred down and buy a car
In a week maybe two,
They'll make you a star
Weeks turn into years

How quick they pass
And all the stars that never were
Are parking cars and pumping gas

It can pull you far away from home

And there you are without a friend

You pack your car and ride away

No crying he makes
I love you, Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle
Until morning is nigh
Away in a manger
No crib for a bed,
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down his sweet head
The stars in the sky
Looked down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay",Away in a Manger
Neil Diamond,"The first Noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay

In fields where they
Lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep
Noel, Noel
Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel, Noel
Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came
From country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star
Wherever it went

Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

Born is the King of Israel
Born is the King of Israel",The First Noel

Christmas past is past
Christmas present is here today
Bringing joy that will last

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away

And here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by

Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love

Oh morning stars together,
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the king
And peace to men on earth

How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of his heaven

And praises sing to God the king
And peace to men on earth

It's time to say goodbye
I'm longing for those country roads
I need to see the sky
Think I'll take a swing down south
Visit Tennessee
See if that girl Annie
Still remembers me

Gonna take that blue highway
And leave this sorry town
Stayed too long, but now I'm gone
And I know where I'm bound
I don't want to take the interstate
It represents all the things I hate
I'm rolling down that blue highway

So long confusion
It's time to slow things down
Say goodbye to my old friends
Ease on out of town
I made me some money here
I paid for every day
And every mile just makes me smile
'Cause I've made my getaway

Gonna take that blue highway
And leave this sorry town
Stayed too long, but now I'm gone
And I know where I'm bound
I've had it up to here with worry
From now on I'm in no hurry

If love is gonna take you by the hand
You need to take your time though
'Cause love is not a thing you can command

There's gotta be a reason
Gotta be a closeness
Gotta have a feeling
Only you can know

And when you find love hold on tight
Don't ever waste another night
You're gonna make it through in spite of your fears
Can anybody hear me

Now that you're here where you belong
I want to be the man you need
Just tell me, you love me
Because I need to hear it too
Just let me be the one

I need you beside me
The road is so long
You run through my heart
Like the words of a bitter sweet song

I'll travel the whole world
Across the earth, around the sun
If I could be the one
You carry deep inside of you

Without you beside me
The road is so long

Me, how I try to deny
That it pointed to you
Too many roads up ahead
Looking shiny and new

Everybody needs someone
But it's gotta mean something
Giving up a part of you's the hardest part
If you want to have someone
Then you really gotta know it
Doesn't take very much to break a heart

May I get lost in your eyes
For a lifetime or two
Something about your and I
Leads me right to the truth

Some people always got
Some thing they've got left to say
Some need to keep it inside
They just want to hide away

And I'm glad I have you there

Or a heart that beckons and then withdraws
And love would never steal my dignity

When love seems unsure
But when love is unkind
It is not love anymore

I fell in love with to old Hank Williams tune
Makes me wonder, is it the same moon Hank played under

Began to think for the first time I might stay
And when I heard that lonesome whistle moan
Knew I'd finally found my way back home

And his words still paint a picture in my heart

Sounded out a warning
""Don't let her,""
""Don't let her walk through the door""
""This is the one you've been waiting for""
Oh, yes, I'd know
However wild it seems,
You know I'd know
And I'd whisper
""Come take my hand, proper stranger""
""Don't go through life as a stranger""
""For I'm a poor proper stranger, too""
""Don't let her,""
""Don't let her walk through the door""
""This is the one you've been waiting for""
Oh, yes, I'd know
However wild it seems,
You know I'd know

I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance

You have come to show you go on
Near, far, wherever you are

Once more, you opened the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

And last for a lifetime
And never let go till we're gone

One true time to hold to
In my life we'll always go on

And cutaway coats

You don't know right from wrong
And in your eyes I see heart aches for me
But from the start, who stole my heart?
Ruby, it's you

Neil Diamond,"Once I had a secret love
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love
Became impatient to be free
So I told the friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are

Now I shout it from the highest hills,
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's no secret anymore

Neil Diamond,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",The Windmills of Your Mind

Neil Diamond,"Just beyond my windowpane, I saw you
Walking in the rain away from me
Visions of your future lay before you
You are free
I saw you in the company of strangers
Laughing just a little bit too loud
Looking at reflections in a mirror
I can see the smiling faces
But not me among the crowd
Wondering how
I wish that I could play this like a love song
So I could shape it like I wanted to
I'd make it purely from the heart
I know that surely from the heart
There only comes the gentlest of tunes
But where are you?
We tried to set the world on fire
And almost did with our desire
Two of us and maybe more
Kids inside a candy store
Sparks of joy and celebration
Suddenly we're drowned beneath the tears
And baby, you're the reason that
I haven't played this song in years
Yes baby, you're the reason that
I haven't played this song in years
Some believe in magic potions
Heads all full of crazy notions
Castles built upon a sandy shore
Only magic I believe in
Is the magic I receive from
Loving you and needing nothing more
Nothing more
We never heard each other's cries
That's how lovers turn to lies
When I gave, you wanted more
Then suddenly we're keeping score
I forgave your small deceptions
Till I couldn't hide my deepest fears

I haven't played this song in years
yes baby, you're the reason that
I haven' t played this song in years",I Haven't Played This Song in Years

As you're goin' down the road
He'll not only point the way

He's gonna help you with the load

I'd call you there

Thought I'd be a teacher
But she would end up teachin' me

But if you ask me
It don't seem right
To spend my life without you there

Just hopin' somehow that I what I seek
Will somehow speak and you'll appear

Where are you, don't let go
So I'm sittin' on a mountain
How can I explain it
I'm livin' with the pain of thinkin' how it
Still could be

Love is what I'm thinkin'
No two ways about it
Go too long without it, 
Nothing really means a thing

Might be the only chance we get

I hope you'd be lost without me

I guess I only needed

I've seen my illusions fly away
Until I had none left at all
And then you rescued
What was left of me
What maybe some would call a fantasy
But me, I'd have to say it only proves
How strange love moves
I need to be your special someone too
'Cause what I needed most
Is what she gave to me
And where she lays her head
Is where I want to be

I got a story to tell you
About an unlikely hero

Rudolph the red nose reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glowed
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
""Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""
Then how the reindeer loved him,
As they shouted out with glee
""Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer
You'll go down in history!""
Yes you will
Yes you will

And just remember all you kids out there
If the other kids laugh at you
Just cause you're a little different
Hey, you could be just like Rudolph
A hero some day

You'll remember that now, won't you
C'mon and sing it with me

Where's the truth we took for granted?
Walking out's not how we planned it
Played it loose, but stayed together
Thought we had the truth
But never knew the score

And its time to go
There's one thing unsaid
Thought you'd want to know
Love you still...guess I will

Neil Diamond,"I'm a man of God
Though I never learned to pray
Walked the pathways of the heart
Found him there along the way

And I am, yes I am, I'm a man of faith
And faith is something you can't see
But if we want to make it through
Faith is how it's got to be

I'm thanking you Lord for giving me song
For making me strong
And for taking my hand
I'll go up to heaven when I reach the end
But up until then
Gonna do what I can

And I can, yes I can be a man of peace
Plant it like a tiny seed
It grows a little when you give
And gives you back when you're in need

No I am, yes I am, I'm a man of song
Gonna sing it far and near
Gonna make a joyful sound
One that every heart can hear

Singing for Him is like touching the sky
I don't need to know why
I just know that it is

Each time I sing out I want to rejoice
'Cause when I hear my voice
I believe that it's His

And I am, yes I am, I'm a man of hope.
I haven't stopped believin' yet
And while we're headin' down that road
Hope is what we can't forget

Neil Diamond,"Didn't I tell you
Don't you remember
Said it so clearly
Couldn't you hear me
I wasn't pretending
I said that I love you
As plain as I can do
Why complicate it?
Why go and make it so hard?
Men are so easy
Laugh if you want to
Once they decipher
They take you for life and
It's worth hanging on to
They tell you they love you
In ways that they can do
Men are so easy
Why does it need to be hard?

A boy becomes a man
And in the time he learns to stand
He finds a way to build a wall
To hide behind if he should fall
He grows to be a man
And show the world that he can stand
Not knowing fear
Or even pain while
Underneath when you look deep
A boy remains
Yes, men are so easy
Just lift up the covers
Cause that's where they hide and
That's where you find them
They are yours to discover
You learn how to read them
And show how you need them
Yes, men are so easy
Just love them and let them be free
It's not complicated
Men are so easy

Isn't something you go off to school to learn

It's not about you

Love is all about we
Yes, it's all about we

Want to take you to that great unknown
Show you to a place you've never been

It's not about you
And it's not about me
Love is all about we
All about we

With a string you can tie a knot
But you gotta have somethin' to tie it to
Otherwise all you've got is a knot
When it ties me to you
It's a whole other thing
'Cause love is all about we
Love is all about we

Love is not about young or old

Neil Diamond,"I'm a man of God
Though I never learned to pray
Walked the pathways of the heart
Found him there along the way

And I am, yes I am, I'm a man of faith
And faith is something you can't see
But if we want to make it through
Faith is how it's got to be

I'm thanking you Lord for giving me song
For making me strong
And for taking my hand
I'll go up to heaven when I reach the end
But up until then
Gonna do what I can

And I can, yes I can be a man of peace
Plant it like a tiny seed
It grows a little when you give
And gives you back when you're in need

No I am, yes I am, I'm a man of song
Gonna sing it far and near
Gonna make a joyful sound
One that every heart can hear

Singing for Him is like touching the sky
I don't need to know why
I just know that it is

Each time I sing out I want to rejoice
Cause when I hear my voice
I believe that it's His

And I am, yes I am, I'm a man of hope.
I haven't stopped believin' yet
And while we're headin' down that road
Hope is what we can't forget

And I am yes I am, I'm a man of God
Know I am, yes I am, I'm a man, I'm a man of faith

Neil Diamond,"It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind","Red, Red Wine [Live/Greek Theatre/Los Angeles/1972]"
Neil Diamond,"So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears
Wish you were here",Solitary Man [Live/Greek Theatre/Los Angeles/1972]

 In worn out shoes 
 Silver hair, a ragged shirt and baggy pants 
 The old soft shoe 
 He jumped so high 
 He jumped so high 
 Then he'd lightly touch down 
 I met him in a cell in New Orleans, I was 
 Down and out 
 He looked to me to be the eyes of age 
 As he spoke right out 
 He talked of life 
 He talked of life 
 He laughed, clicked his heels and stepped 
 He said his name, Bojangles and he danced a lick 
 Across the cell 
 He grabbed his pants, a better stance 
 Oh, he jumped so high 
 Then he clicked his heels 
 He let go a laugh 
 He let go a laugh 
 Pushed back his clothes all around

 Traveled about

 He up and died 
 After twenty years he still grieves 
 He said I dance now at every chance in honky tonks 
 For drinks and tips 
 But most the time I spend behind these county bars 
 He said I drinks a bit

 And as he shook his head 
 I heard someone ask him please

Believed while I was gone away
But I do just fine
But I couldn't get the music of my mind
And I couldn't leave the needing you behind

Read the word from the page
Free the bird from the cage
Just go out there and face
What you did, before
Did it once
You can do it once more
Yeah

[Chorus: ]
Coming back for one more bite of the apple
Tastes as sweet
It's the nectar of life
And you know that it's right
'Cause you know you're not out there alone
And that one more bite of the apple is all
You gonna need to bring it home

I couldn't count the chances that I've lost
Couldn't count the chances or the cost
But I can't help thinking about the days
Of way back when
And I know I wanna taste them once again
Yes I know I wanna taste them once again

Got some things to be said
Going round in my head
Time to get out of bed
'Cause I've slept too long
And I know there's a place I belong
Yeah

[Chorus: ]

Was a time that I won't ever forget
They were times that I will never regret
I've been thinking about those days
Since way back when
And thinking I could bring back again
Just maybe I could bring them back again

One more dance in the night
One more chance to get it right
One more grab at the brass ring that's flying by
One more toast to the mud in your eye
Yeah

[Chorus: ]

I'll be back
And sitting up high on the saddle
All I want
Is to do it once more
Let me get through that door
'Cause I still do believe that I can
Want that one more bite of the apple
And just a chance to taste it, once again

Been around the world a time or two
Everywhere I've been I thought of me and you
I was hoping you'd remember how it used to be
And maybe that you'd still remember me
And that apple just as sweet as it could be
Reach right up and pick one of that apple tree",One More Bite of the Apple
Neil Diamond,"It was getting deeper into the night
Knew you weren't coming home
Nothing I was doing was right and now
I've got to face it alone

The night getting darker baby the darker it got
Struggled with why and what
But I could not fight what I knew was true I was
Not going to get through the night

Without the power of two
Me and you

Feeling like I'm out on a ledge standing
With my back to the wall l use to be I'd go straight ahead
Now I'm going nowhere at all
The night getting longer baby the longer it went
Just didn't make any sense

Couldn't see couldn't hear didn't know what to do
Was like I had no power at all 

Without the power of two
Me and You

I never knew before that two was more then one and one
Until that night
There's nothing I could do but think of how I'm losing you
And it shook me it shock me
You locked me out there

Looking for a place I could hide
Searching for a corner to turn  
Left me here alone for one night
Showed me I had something to learn
I tried not to need you but I needed you anyway

It wouldn't be easy to say
But the way that I see it I'm half without you
And I'm not going to make myself whole

Without the power of two
Me and you

Morning couldn't wait
I knew that it was getting late
But I hung on I had no choice at all
It was either walk away or crawl and
I'm Bleeding I'm Bleeding

I think I'm falling deeper into that hole
Deeper then I thought I could get
Like a bug that's stuck in a bowl climbing out is impossible
Yet he keeps trying harder,
Harder then he thought he could

I finally understood
I could hear I could see and the truth came through
We had ten time the power of one

We had the power of two
Me and you 
There's nothing we couldn't do
Just me and you
We had the power of two",The Power of Two

When I returned I was rich man
Didn't believe love could quench my thirst

Neil Diamond,"Pick it up
Hurry up son
We gotta run if you wanna get down
Clean speed
Where does it need you
If you wanna succeed
I'm thinking you need to
But are y really sure

It's a lot to endure
But I got me a cure
Slow it down!
Slow it down you
Slow it down
Take your time and you'll find your time has a meaning
Easy now
Catch those sounds of your heartbeat before it's leaving
You say you want satisfaction
Just steaming away from the action
Get some traction
Between you and the scenery

Say hello way
Not to fast
It don't last
Just follow my reflection

Day by day
See that view
It's for you
Just pay some affection

Forget about competition
Your dover and intuition
Stop your wishing
Won't get there by dreaming

Slow it down!
Slow it down you
Take your time
Even last and reclaim
Desine and desting

Doing fine
Make it flow
Let it go
You'll see it walk the alley
You're looking for bitter and greater
And counting on sooner and later
That's the way you won't be free
Slow it down!
Slow it down
Slow it down
Slow it down you
Slow it down
Slow it down",Slow It Down
Neil Diamond,"[Chorus]
Whose hands are these
That reach into a secret place
Whose hands are these
That brush across my sleeping face
Like quiet waves, on silent shores
Whose hands are these
These hands are yours

Whose name is called
To find my soul in need of care
Whose name is called
To answer when that need is there
A name that sings, who's music sours
Whose name is called
That name is yours

When I need peace
A quiet that belongs to me
To be released
From on a loud and angry scene
I think of you
Thinking of you quiets me
As only you can do
For me

Whose eyes are these
That see into this place I live
Whose eyes are these
Show me what Ive yet to give
That see beyond unopened doors
Whose eyes are these
These eyes are yours

Where do I go
When not a door is open wide
What can I know
When questioned asked are un-replied
I know of one
One is all I need to confide
To fill that place inside
Of me

Whose hands are these
These hands are yours",Whose Hands Are These
Neil Diamond,"I spend the night in the chair
Thinking she'll be there but she never comes
And then I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes
And I rise to face another day without her
Do do do, do do do do, do do do

It's just no good anymore
When you walk through the door of an empty room
And then you go inside and set a table for one
It's no fun when you spend a day without her
Do do do, do do do do, do do do

We burst the pretty balloon
Took us to the moon, it's such a beautiful thing
But it's ended now and it sounds like a lie
If I said I'd rather die than live without her
Do do do, do do do do, do do do

Love is a beautiful thing
When it knows how to swing and it moves like a clock
But the hands on the clock tell the lovers to part
And it's breaking my heart to have to spend a day without her
Do do do, do do do do, do do do

I spend the night in the chair
Thinking she'll be there but she never comes
And then I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes
And I rise to face another day without her
Do do do, do do do do

Can't go on without her
Do do do, do do do do
There's no song without her
It's all wrong without her
Can't go on without her",Without Her [*]
Neil Diamond,"One, knowing I'm one, hearing of two
And like a child believing dreams
Always a dream to take you home

Day, after the day, there comes the night
There comes the knowing when you laugh
If you should laugh,
The night alone will hear
And the night don't care

Cold water morning
Take off your nighttime shoes
Cold water morning
I've been waiting so long for you

Hearing of things that I once had
That you once had

With many a winding turn
That leads us to who knows where
Who knows where

Strong enough to carry him
He ain't heavy, he's my brother

So on we go
His welfare is of my concern
No burden is he, to bear
We'll get there
For I know
He would not encumber me
He ain't heavy, he's my brother

If I'm laden at all
I'm laden with sadness
That everyone's heart
Isn't filled with the gladness
Of love for one another

It's a long, long road
From which there is no return
While we're on our way to there
Why not share

And the load
Doesn't weigh me down at all

He ain't heavy, he's my brother.","He Aint Heavy, He's My Brother"

Neil Diamond,"Morningside, the old man died.
And no one cried, they simply turned away.
And when he died,
He left a table filled with nails and pride.
And with his hands he carved these words inside:
""For my children""

Morning light, morning bright.
I spent the night with dreams that make you weep.
Morning time,
Wash away the sadness from these eyes of mine,
For I recall the words an old man signed:
""For my children""

And the legs were shaped with his hands,
And the table made with oaken wood.
And the children that sat around this great table,
Touched it with their laughter, and that was good.

Morningside, the old man died.
And no one cried, he surely died alone.
And truth is sad,
For not a child would claim the gift he had.
The words he carved became his epitaph......

Ring ting tingle-ing too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside, the snow is falling

And friends are calling: ""You hoo""
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap, let's go
Just look at the snow
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap, it's grand

Just holding your hand
We're gliding along with the song
Of a wintry, wonderland
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like

Birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

There's a birthday party
At the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs
We love to sing without a single stop

At the fireplace
While we watch the chestnuts pop
There's a happy feeling
Nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffee

And the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print
By Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things
We remember all through our lives
Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing

Ring ting tingle-ing too
Come on, it's lovely weather

In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
We'll pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: ""Are you married?""
We'll say: ""No man""
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

And in the meadow
We can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun
With mister snowman
Until the other kids
Come knock him down

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made

Used to hate to leave me
Now after lovin' me late at night
When it's good for you
And you're feelin' alright
Well you just roll over
And turn out the light
And you don't bring me flowers anymore

It used to be so natural
To talk about forever
But ""used to be's"" don't count anymore
They just lay on the floor
'Til we sweep them away

And baby, I remember
All the things you taught me
I learned how to laugh
And I learned how to cry
Well I leared how to love
Even learned how to lie
You'd think I could learn
How to tell you goodbye

Neil Diamond,"I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

Then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried

I thought love was more or less a giving thing
Seems the more I gave the less I got
What's the use in trying
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain

Then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried",I'm a Believer

Neil Diamond,"She was morning
And I was night time
I one day woke up
To find her lying
Beside my bed
I softly said
""Come take me""

In need of someone
As though I'd done
Someone wrong somewhere
I don't know where
Come lately

You are the sun

You are the words
I am the tune

Song she brang to me

Warmed the night
And what was right
Became me

You are the sun
I am the moon
You are the words

Neil Diamond,"In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promise myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top
To throw myself off
In an effort to
Make it clear to whoever
Wants to know what it's like
When you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch at a church
Were people saying, my God, that's tough
She stood him up
No point in us remaining
We may as well go home
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Threw me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about, God in His mercy
Oh, if he really does exist
Why did he desert me
In my hour of need
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally

Seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do
What do we do

Looking back over the years
And whatever else appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide my tears
And at sixty-six years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start
With a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally",Alone Again (Naturally)

That David played, and it pleased the Lord

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you
To a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
From your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Baby I have been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you.

Get it right with a few small corrections
Find a groove, you just got to stay with it
Got to move, it's your life got to live it

Spirit down, look around
There's a cold wind a-blowin'
Being strong's what you long for
But you've got to show it
You're too vain to complain and ashamed
No one knows you at all

And you're alone at the ball
You're all alone at the ball

Got a car
Cadillac
El Dorado
Take it far, up to high Colorado
Got to move, it's your life got to live it
Find a groove then you got to stay with it

Hey this life's all about striking out taking chances
What's the point of it all if you call no one answers
Spend your time make rhyme
Just to find no one dancing at all

Then you're alone at the ball
You're all alone at the ball

Sing your song move along
'Cause the future awaits you
Free your brain from the chains
That remain to enslave you
Took your hits kept your wits
Never flinched stayed yourself through it all

Now you're alone at the ball
You're all alone at the ball
All alone, at the ball
You're all alone

Neil Diamond,"She said, it’s time to teach you the art of love
She said, we’re gonna reach to the heart of love
A place you never knew, a place that lives somewhere inside of you

I know I’m on a journey I won’t forget
I know I had it in me to give and yet I never could
Before I had to, if I wanted to be yours

You made me see I’d have to be a brand new man
He lives in me, so here in me is where I began

You showed the kind of lesson I can’t erase
You showed a way to get from that lonely place
To where love comes alive
And you’d be waiting there when I arrived

The truth was clear,
Love’s not a place you go to find
It lives in here
Just leave it space, give it time

I learned that I could stumble and maybe fall
I learned in being humble I’d have it all
A brand new way to live,
That love’s not what you have but what you give
And the art of love is who you share it with",The Art of Love

Finally out there on your own and it's

It's your time, and it's gonna happen your way
Every step you take from now on,
Be taken as far as you can
You oughta be moving along
Singing your song, and making your plans
First time, first time

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
First time
Like a Ferris wheel
Scared to go, but it's no big deal that
First time
It's always the best
Remember it's still you forget all the rest it's
Your time
So live in the moment
It's your time, you don't want to throw it away!
Still remember the first word you wrote
And every single note that you've played!
Got a book and you learned it by road
Long time ago, remember that day?
Make rhyme
So fine
First time!

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
First time
It comes unaware,
You're un-rehearsed, and unprepared for that
First time, you're free and unbound
No planet's safe gotta jump on the sound it's
Your time
And good things will happen
But this time, you gotta put your heart in the game!
You're out for the very first time,
But you're not really out there alone
Keep doing it, and words gonna spread
Get out of your bed, set out on your own.
Keep trying
Be fine
First time!
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

This time
The whole world is watching
This time, you better put your heart in the game!
You're rocking for the very first time
You only want the feeling to last,
And every single ? Going out
Leaves less of a doubt, it's all in the past!

You shine
You're flyin'

Neither believin' the way it all came down
Didn't count much lost in paying the cost for a while, girl

In better days when love came easy
We had it all but I never knew
How much there was when I had you
In better days, in better days

I remember a time there wasn't a dime between us two
We lived in a little old place on the side of a hill
Gave it our best in love, did the rest for me and you
Too young to lose, too hot to chill

In better days we had it all
In better days when love came easy
We had it all but I never knew
How much I lost when I lost you
In better days, in better days

Why do we promise forever and never stay that long?
Why do we swear to care until we die?
And what does it mean when two lovers sing loving songs
Then move along, and not know why

Melody from the start,
Telling things will be okay
I think that I just might stay
On Melody Road

Melody Road, let's go a mile
I'll tie on my rambling shoes
Write me a song to make you smile
There's no need to sing the blues,
On Melody Road

Melodies that unfold,
Melodies made of gold,
Making up songs along the way
I'm thinking I just might stay
On Melody Road

Ringing out like a bell
Singing out I can tell
I'm not alone
Melody Road it's you and me
Floating out on a dream
I love every song that comes to me
'Cause I know it comes to be
On Melody Road, Melody Road
Melody road, Melody Road

We'll try again
Just like we tried before
Two of us out there making friends
Instead of making war

Neil Diamond,"It wasn't nothing but a heartache
In the middle of a bad dream
Like I took on the whole world
And I never had a chance, girl

Was a one-way conversation
I never got the invitation
The sharpness of her words deceiving
And I couldn't stop the bleeding

And Lord, I tried to be forgiving
But getting by don't mean you're living
And on that highway going nowhere
Was an exit overdue

And all she had to give was heartache
So she broke my heart in two
Yes, she did

You found me drifting in a small boat
In the middle of an ocean
You were there on my horizon
And I didn't have a notion

Unprepared to comprehend it
Felt alone and unattended
Said my prayers and reached my hand out
And you appeared to me that day

Came and led me to a new shore
I had never been there before
Put me in the right direction
And you led me out of Hell

And if it wasn't for your good heart
I'd have never broke her spell
'Cause you promised me tomorrow
But I learned that lesson well
Yes, I did. Oh yes, I did

You're the sum of all my heartbeats
You're the only truth my heart needs
Showed me how to make the journey
I can't let you walk away, no, not today

'Cause I've already slept with heartache
Time to chase the night away
Just the two of us together
And does forever sound okay?

Say, ""Yes, it does""
Say, ""Yes, it does""
Oh, yes it does",Nothing But a Heartache
Neil Diamond,"Seongah and Jimmy,
Seongah and Jimmy
They found each other
Downtown in Brooklyn
She's from Korea, he's from Long Island
They found each other,
And they discovered love

Seongah and Jimmy,
Seongah and Jimmy
Both have a sister,
Both have a brother
She learns her English
He learns Korean
They learn that love is spoken in many ways

Seongah, how close can two lovers be?
Each day's a promise I'll never let you go
Seongah, how long must two lovers dream?
My head is reeling, feelings I've never known

Work in the city, go there together
They take the subway, all kinds of weather
Friends in her office know her as Sarah,
Seongah and Jimmy work for a better day

Seongah and Jimmy,
Seongah and Jimmy
Live near each other, out there in Green Point
Move in together, promise forever
She cooks Korean, he likes Korean too

Seongah, don't be impatient with me
With you beside me, nowhere that I can't go
Seongah, dream how you want love to be
And I'll make a promise I'll try to make it so

She wants her Masters, he helps her study
He has a toothache, she finds a dentist
He says I love you, she knows he means it
She says Saranghae, he knows she means it too

I hear music in the air
People dancing in the street
Loves in blossom everywhere
Even strangers start to greet
Love happens in Brooklyn
I live there long ago, and nothing's changed
Brought flowers, she took them
They laughed together in the pouring rain, de de de de de de de de de de de

Oh yeah
Seongah and Jimmy,
Seongah and Jimmy
Soon they get married, in came their families
Her's from Korea, his from Long Island
They stayed together, and made a joyful day

They had so much to say

They found a better way",Seongah and Jimmy
Neil Diamond,"I came with a little bit of sorrow
Was maybe a bit too sad
But one day rolled into tomorrow
And you gave me the best you had
That's how we started together
And how together we're gonna stay

You taught me a little 'bout good times
I fought through a little bit of rain
You brought me a part of your sunshine
You took in the heart of my pain
It wasn't supposed to happen
But then you happened to come my way

Every night, every day
Every word that you say made it so
Every thought that I had
Said I ought to be glad, now I know

You showed what a little bit of love can do
You opened my eyes and a light came through
Took me to a place that I never knew
Goodbye to my little bit of something blue

You came and you found me wanting
And I'm saying that I'm in your debt
Some days were a little bit daunting
Some days I'd rather forget
You changed my life for the better
And I know I'd better be good to you

Every night, every day
Every word that you say made it so
Every thought that I had
Said I ought to be glad, now I know

You showed what a little bit of love can do
You opened my eyes and a light came through
Took me to a place that I never knew
So long to my little bit of something blue

It wasn't supposed to happen
But then you happened to come my way

Every night, every day
Every word that you say made it so
Every thought that I had
Said I ought to be glad. Now I know

You showed what a little bit of love can do
You opened my eyes and a light came through
Took me to a place that I never knew

Farewell to my little bit of something blue.",Something Blue
Neil Diamond,"She had a sunny disposition
He had a cloud that never went away
She woke up singing almost every day
It turned him all around
And brought him in from the pouring rain

She had a sunny way of talking
And when she finished she'd always smile
It wasn't flashy but she had style
She touched him so profound
That he was never to be the same

First she had him walking
Then he'd be talking
Walking and talking
And soon he'd be laughing out loud

Never would believe it
If you couldn't see it
She came to be someone that he could not be without

They made a sunny combination
You wouldn't think so but it was true
They heard a voice coming from the blue
True love was calling out
And it was calling them both by name

Started with a whisper
Pretty soon he kissed her
That's when that whisper
Turn into a mighty roar

More than just affection
Made a real connection
That's when he knew she was what he was missing before

She gave him plenty inspiration
And every song he wrote from then til now
Had something about it explaining how
She turned his life around

Before her sunny disposition
He didn't know where he was going
She had a funny way of knowing
And knowing felt so right
When she became his wife
She brought her disposition",Sunny Disposition

Neil Finn,"See it anyone got my eyes got my face
Sing it everyone got my nose got my blood
Conscience plays upon me now
Safe until my luck runs out
Cukoos call, pendulum swings
I thought you knew everything
Lift my hands make the cross

Sinner I have never learned
Beginner I cannot return
Forever I must walk this earth
Like some forgotten soldier

Those things I should keep to myself
But I feel somehow strangely compelled
Under moonlight I stood wild and naked
Felt no shame just my spirit awakened

Sinner got my eyes got my face
Fireball drop from the sky
All my dreams have come to pass
Where's my faith is it lost
Can't see it 'till you cast it off

Sinner there is no such thing
Beginner I have learned to sing
Forever I must walk this earth
Like some forgotten soldier

Today I am still disconnected
To the face that I saw in the clouds
And the closest I get to contentment
Is when all of the barriers come down",Sinner [#]
Neil Finn,"Beware late night thinking
Before starlight's over
The world has been shaken

And you lay above me

Beware violent mood swing
Before I can stop it
The word has been spoken
Rain
I felt myself sinking
And you lay above me
The earth drew me in
Identical twin
Some say that's good
That you can be certain
You did all you could
Leave all your questions

My life filled below

Every time you are near
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Why do stars fall down from the sky?
Every time you walk by
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
And the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true

So they sprinkled moon dust
In your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around

I don't pretend to know what you want

No fire where I lit my spark
I am not afraid of the dark
Where your words devour my heart
And put me to shame, put me to shame

And your seven worlds collide
Whenever I am by your side
And dust from a distant sun
Will shower over everyone

You're still so young to travel so far
Old enough to know who you are
Wise enough to carry the scars
Without any blame, there's no one to blame
It's easy to forget what you learned
Waiting for the thrill to return
Feeling your desire burn
You're drawn to the flame

When your seven worlds collide
Whenever I am by your side
And dust from a distant sun
Will shower over everyone
Dust from a distant sun
Will shower over everyone

And I'm lying on the table
Washed out in the flood
Like a Christian fearing vengeance from above
I don't pretend to know what you want
But I offer love

Kevin has a caterpillar squeezed between his fingers

And you lie with a look to the side
And you say I was addicted to the drug
Now I know when I've had enough
Could curl up and sleep on the floor
But now I'm riding the train a hundred miles an hour
Feels like this train might never stop, ooh
Watching static on the television
When the morning comes
And you wait and it makes you feel strange
As if you were deranged

You sunset diving bird
You cool wind set upon the branches of a tree

Low cloud moving cross the sky

One day they will uncover you
Young girl wash the sleep out of your eyes
Dust on my piano
Wool rest never sleeping

All your best one-liners borrowed from a film
The thing that gets to me
Is how you're never free
And how the spirit yearns

Your body is a prison
One day they will discover you
Low cloud moving cross the sky
One day they will uncover you...

The thing that gets to me

Come with the wind, time to begin
There'll be no compromise

When all you want is wrapped around you
As those saints preserve us when we're dying

It's a dead man who would refuse
And twice the man to fill his shoes
And the hunger inside
Won't go away it's starting to rise

Shouldn't say so much
Shouldn't talk so loud

I play the happenstance, oh, I see my fortune fly
Sometime you lift it up, another long day goes by

And I won't travel into the straw daylight desire
I wrote that some Eskimo gave me the line

Sit back and watch the money burn, five days in a hot house hell
Once you're gone there's no return but I never wanna let you lie+ 0.50
I want my love to burn, hotter than a comet's tail
I want my bed to cry, I never wanna let you down

And I won't travel into the straw daylight desire
I wrote that some Eskimo gave me the line

And all I ever do is therapy, one on one, one on one
And you and I, we might want the same thing, one on one, one on one
I don't want a teacher to remind me, one on one, one on one
Well , how to get something better out of my life, life, life, yeah

I play the happenstance, well, I see my fortune fly
Every time you lift the cup and another long day goes by

And I won't travel into the pale moonlight desire
I wrote that some Eskimo gave me the line

Your freedom, wow it's so precious that it makes me hurt
I learnt that my teachers were my loneliness
And wisdom can be passed on by the one who's left
Your freedom, it's so precious that it makes it work

Neil Finn,"I went down the track, made the wrong turn
Finished up where I started
Noticed a change come over me
Fell in love with my own reflection, yeah

How does it feel beneath your own wheel?
Feel like an accident waking up
Under a bus with my fingers crossed
Now is the time we could make it up

So, you lost the fear, it wasn't that bad
Left to your own devices, yeah
Still a young girl, eyes on the clock
Tick like a motor running out

Magnets and words up on the fridge
Speak to the poet in all of us
I missed the page that you thought about

Drew in the frost on the windowpane
And who I wonder could fail to notice
The aching silence come down
I'm humbled now

I hope you might come back
In your own time
Left to your own devices

Secret God, breathe my name
Secret God, stir up the dust
Whisper my name

This reminds me of another place
Lonesome Wolf comes down from the hills
It is walking in circles howling at the moon
In another life, he will be enchanted by a woman

Secret God, stir up the dust
Breathe my name
Secret God, stir up the dust
Whisper my name
In my mind

See a man collapse
In the doorway of a restaurant
Holding my hand out
The first one there to help him up

At the height of summer; see a boy of five
At the water's edge so nimble and free
Jumping over the ripples, looking way out to sea

Now a man comes up from amongst the throng
Takes the young boy's hand, and his hand is strong
And the child feels safe, yeah, the child feels brave
As he's carried in those arms up and over the waves

Deeper water, deeper water, deeper water, calling him on
Let's move forward now and the child's seventeen
With a girl in the back seat, tugging at his jeans
And she knows what she wants; she guides with her hand
As a voice cries inside him: ""I'm a man! I'm a man!""

Deeper water, deeper water, deeper water, calling him on
Now the man meets a woman, unlike all the rest
He doesn't know it yet, but he's out of his depth
And he thinks he can run; it's a matter of pride
But he keeps coming back like a cork on the tide

Well the years hurry by, and the woman loves the man
Then one night in the dark she grabs hold of his hand
Says: ""There, can you feel it kicking inside?""
And the man gets a shiver right up and down his spine

Deeper water, deeper water, deeper water, calling him on
So the clock moves around, and the child is a joy
But Death doesn't care just who it destroys
Now the woamn gets sick, thins down to the bone
She says: ""Where I'm going next, I'm going alone.""

Takes her over the breakers

He started up his drinking, then they started fighting
He took it pretty badly, she took both the kids
She said: ""I'm not standing by, to watch you slowly die
So watch me walking, out the door""
She said, ""Shove it, Jack, I'm walking out the fucking door""

She went to her brother's, got a little bar work
He went to the Buttery, stayed about a year
Then he wrote a letter, said I want to see you
She thought he sounded better, she sent him up the fare
He was riding through the cane in the pouring rain
On Olympic to her door

He came in on a Sunday, every muscle aching
Walking in slow motion like he'd just been hit
Did they have a future? Would he know his children?
Could he make a picture and get them all to fit?
He was shaking in his seat riding through the streets
In a silvertop to her door",To Her Door
Neil Finn,"Come on baby I want your love to be
Based in real life better than TV
What was before the action of desire
Becomes a deeper need for comfort, inspiration
You have the mind for understanding pain
Somehow to realise no trouble is in vain
It’s a reason for and how it came to pass
If there is a chance if there is a chance
That you wanted to dance, that you wanted to sing
Don’t die wondering,
Was there something missing?

Come on baby I want your love to be
Big and strong enough to rise above me
Don’t leave your best designs buried in your dreams
They’re sneaking up on you, give you an adventure
Our destiny is better than before
Those old familiar foes can’t hurt you anymore
And it’s a war I’m waging with the enemy
If there is a chance, if there is a chance
That you wanted to jam that you wanted to sing
Don’t die wondering
If there is a chance, if there is a chance
That you wanted to dance that you wanted to sing
Don’t die wondering

If we both get carried away
I’d be happy to see
At the end of the world
It’s just you and me
As we lay in the bath
Letting our hair down

If we end up paying the price
For this beautiful scene
At the end of the world
It’s just you and me
As we lay in the dark
Letting our hair down
Letting our hair down

It’s better than TV
Is it better than TV

Neil Finn,"Sat by the window, widow sat
And dreamed of planes in silhouette
In cloud formations overhead

Oh, you better get there when it matters
When she’s taking off, you will really need to hold on tight
Pretty soon the connection is made
We’re ascending higher and higher each day
And there’s no turning back
Sun is overhead, target’s down below
It’s gonna be a wreck, alright

It’s a risk if you’re flying fast enough
With the rush of blood, you can bet you’ll forget anyone
She understands where you’re taking her
And she won’t break up under the strain
The engine sighs it’s time, we must pull her out
I have this to say to you, I’ll do my best to save you
But I’m hoping I don’t black out
'Cause there’s only one way down

Then I wake up in a sweat

You could be lost but here you are
It's Halloween, on the street

I'm sealed in tight, through the double glass
Come inside, take off your mask
All the zombies in town
They're all dead to us now
And we can't hear the song they're playing

Smoke drifting up
To the dizzy heights
Where the elevator won't come down
And the ceiling cracks like a treasure map
The mosquito's buzzing round, round, round
Help me make up a new sound

It's alright in my room
The worlds moving at a different pace
Ah the buzz it never stops
If you don't like the groove well call the cops

On Halloween, it's Halloween
And they don't make a sound
'Cause I don't like the song they're playing

Neil Finn,"You must reveal your infinite sorrow
Show what you’re made of and what you’re afraid of
You’ll have to leave the comfort of shadows
The places you came from, the troubles you played on
Out on the landing leaves are descending
Summer is ending and daylight is blue
Is that you rising up

Flying in the face of love
Now you set your mind to run
In circles around everyone
Flying in the face of love
Thinking enough is enough
Before you get too involved

Like this isn’t real, it’s just a feeling
That gets in the way sometimes
Every distraction you can imagine
Like a disclaimer it’s turning you off
Always turning you off

Flying in the face of love
Now you’ve set your mind to run
In circles around everyone
Flying in the face of love
And dreaming of the one you lost

Were you thinking of her when you wrote that song
Sing it to me, your mysterious life I’m reminded of
Think about her, and it feels like a new sensation then it’s gone

Flying in the face of love
How much longer will you run
In circles around everyone

Neil Finn,"It’s a curious sound
Bone collectors rustling leaves on their knees
Many poets in this town
Look high and low for feelings that come and go
Sweeping the past out of their windows and doors
Well I’m not so humble but I’m always on time
Believing what is left behind
All the shades and echoes of my life
Are in my blood

In my blood …feelings are lasting
In my blood …they never go away
In my blood …end up in a place
Somewhere where you don’t have to miss it all
The flavour on my tongue,
In my blood …the fall of winter sun
In my blood …the sparkle in your eyes
In my blood …the moment when I die
I’m hoping that I won’t have to miss it all

Reincarnate, how I wish that I could come back again,
How I wish that I could do this again

Melancholy beats my heart
Her cries mistaken for the sound of loneliness
There are far too many stars
On the earth there is but two of us
Gingerly down there for my hand is a thief
I’m bound to fumble when the moment is right
As another one is lost its a kind of release
And it’s coming to me with a sense of relief

In my blood …feelings are lasting
In my blood …they never go away

Your willingness to perform

As bridges stand against the tide
Satellites move across the sky
In all the years that I have seen you rise
You never looked so supreme

I should never complain again

If you can hear the circuits jam I cannot tell

To the top of the hill I dig in my heels
And I whisper gently to the lord of the fields
And I listen closely to the sound of the bees
But I fear my nature has lost me

You can stay here for the rest of your life
I’ll open windows when you want to look out
At the transit of Venus ‘cross the sun

Ancient dragons and the cicadas come
The edges jagged as you’re coming undone
On the white soft feathers of your bed

Well you know how hard I try
But I won’t get nowhere analyzing your life
And it’s people that you lose
When you become a recluse

Turn away from us
Days are darker when the winter comes
Can’t remove yourself from what you have done
On the rack where your reputation lies
Do you want to exist
Between the lightning and the mental bliss
Or needing nothing and with no one to miss
Like a stray dog pissing on a statue

Solitude is hard to find
And they’re all too busy organizing your life
But it’s people that you lose

All I want is to be dancing round in your light
With the colours that you choose
When you become a recluse
Ohh
I make any excuse to stay home
But I can’t do that and I must come back
People that stay at home
Watching a game of thrones
And wondering what comes next
Well you can’t do that and you must come back

'Til Winter was over and my heart could be saved

It was love at first sight the first time around,

Or is it you?

Your bicycle makes trouble for us all
You got no brakes, yeah, you got the shakes
And little boys, well, they drop their toys
When you fly past, yes, they do

The art of living well is not just choice
It?s down to luck and who you trust
Oh little twig, you do trust well

Seagulls on the roof have kept me wide
Awake and pale in case I fail
To sleep again, to dream of you
To take my turn on some thing new

Mudguard in a flap and chain is slack
Oh little twig, you rattle past
Like a can of nails on an angel's tail
Yes, you do, yes, you do

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do

Oh, sentimental drinkers
Sing songs that end in fights about fights

And they'll swear to you
That they just can't help it
Know that poem in their head
That painting of your bed, it must out

Does time stand still
When you cross the room?
Oh, surely it must do
When they write a song
That goes on and on about you

Does your golden hair, fall in waves?
No mention of a spot
Tantrum or tooth rot, not for them

Just pearly smiles and Mona Lisa wiles
For your coterie of stars
Your barrel of charlatans

Celebrate, and they will venerate
Hold their heads in the morning glare
For with some faint praise
They will hold your gaze
And dedicate it all to you
Yeah, dedicate it all to you

Oh, you live your life in black and white
No subtlety for you, no mercy for the muse
It?s true

Come in again, number 10
Oh, your army of typewriters
Your consequence of biters won't last long

And life will burden you not
Love will carry on with a thrust

And they'll swear to you
That they just can't help it
That poem in their head
That painting of your bed
It must out, it must out

Celebrate and they will venerate
Hold their heads in the morning glare

Run Samson run, you ain't got time to stay
Run Samson run, on your mark you better start
I'd rather trust a hungry lion than a gal with a cheatin heart
Oh Delilah made Sammy's life a sin
And he perished when the roof fell in
There's a moral so listen to me pal
There's a little of Delilah in each and every gal
Oh, run Samson run, Delilah's on her way

But how can you tell,
You never get inside my head.
The times we talk, we never speak,
We play hide and seek
So many things are left unsaid.
 
Why can't you see
What's on the other side of me,
The side of me that reaches out to you.
Sweet thoughts and dreams,
Like drops of rain on rippling streams
That wind and bend,
Rivers with no end,
Flowing on the other side of me.
 
It seems I always get unstrung
I trip on my tongue
With words that come out something else.
I'm so afraid the things I say
Might chase you away,
I have to hide behind myself.
 
Why can't you see
What's on the other side of me,
The side of me that reaches out to you.
Why must I hide
These feelings that have been denied.
Only you can set me free
See what's on the other side of me.

Magic stairways, moods, and Junes

Round and round the records go

Came and danced across the stage

Yesterday is yesterday
The past is dead and gone
Nostalgia just gets in the way

This will be our last song together

Neil Sedaka,"I believe that nothing lasts forever
Promises won't help us stay together
Life for us was never hearts and flowers my friend

Maybe it's because we tried so seldom
So much must change today
That I can only hope and pray

As I watch you leave the room that I'll see you very soon
And it's all that I can do to keep from running after you
And though I wanted you
I let you walk away

My hands begin to tremble and my knees shake
Somewhere along the line I hope we can make amends

Shared in the hope of mending broken dreams

And through the tears that fall like winter rain
You say you're tired of merely just surviving
We've so much in common that we're

Perfect strangers singing perfectly in tune
From separate corners of the room
Held together by our hunger to get by
Perfect strangers, you and I

Wet down the painful sting of sweet love lost
Let evening find us whispering in our whiskey
Come and sit beside me for a while

You know I love to see you smile
And if perhaps you're only passing through
At least we tried to reach an understanding
And for just one moment we were

While you talk about the future, 
it's becomin' the past

Looking through my tears,

Making plans was so much fun 
We set our goals and reached the highest star 
Things that we were after were much better from afar
Here we stand just me and you

Music would play
They tell me the days were sweet and clear
It was a sweeter tune, and there was so much room
That people could come from everywhere

Come to marry his fortune with a hand full of promises
To find they've closed the door, they don't want him anymore

That spoke of a mystical, magical land called America

Neil Sedaka,"In the shadows
You get to know your lover mostly by feel
Got to put your faith in things you can touch
If you dare to 
'Cause the shadows can make you crazy 
With the things they reveal
They show it all without revealing too much 
Scare the hell out of you
'Cause me and my love
Live among the shadows
Where the old playground is an alley way
Now me and my love make love among the shadows
When the sun goes down in a dark hallway
Love in the shadows where the crowd never goes
Deep in the shadows where flowers won't grow
Me and my baby know love in the shadows
In the shadows
You got to work at love to get it to shine
You can't believe in everything that you see
Not this time around
'Cause the shadows can play 
A half a million tricks on your mind
You try your best but you can never break free
It just kind of drags you down
'Cause me and my love
Live among the shadows
Where the old playground is an alley way
Now me and my love make love among the shadows
When the sun goes down in a dark hallway
Love in the shadows where the sun never shines
Deep in the shadows where most men go blind
Me and my baby find love in the shadows

Look in my heart and let love keep us together

Neil Sedaka,"There was a man, a lonely man
Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared, that went unchecked
Until it died in his silence

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself, it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

Another day, a lonely day
So much to say that goes unspoken
And through the night, his sleepless nights
His eyes are closed, his heart is broken

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
She's coming back again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

A little hope, goes up in smoke
Just how it goes, goes without saying

It's just like magic when I hold you near.
Oh Sunny, stay by me.
 
I never wore a smile
'Til the day I found you.
Now all I do is smile
Whenever I'm around you.
It's such a wonderful world,
Say that you'll always be my sunshine girl.
Sunny stay by me.
 
My life was sad and lonely,
I never saw the sun.
But the very moment that I held you tight
I walked out of the darkness and into the light.
 
I love no one but you
Sunny please believe me.
Don't ever say we're through,
Sunny never leave me.
Promise you won't go away,
Love me for ever as you do today.
Oh Sunny, stay by me.

Neil Sedaka,"What am I gonna do when the sun goes down
And all the lights are low,
What am I gonna do when I recall
The love we used to know.
I remember the happiness we knew,
Darling can't we make up soon
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do.

What am I gonna do on Wednesday night
When I used to call you on the phone,
What am I gonna say at the Record Hop
When I show up alone.
There all ask me what's become of you,
Darling can't we make up soon
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do.

At the movies or at the football game,
Please believe me, nothing's gonna be the same.

So what am I gonna do on Saturday night
Whan everything goes wrong,
How am I gonna feel when the radio
Plays our favourite song.
I'm so lonely just like Mr. Blue,
Darling can't we make up soon
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do.",What Am I Gonna Do
Neil Sedaka,"You are the answer to my lonely prayer
You are an angel from above
I was so lonely till you came to me
With the wonder of your love.
I don't know how I ever lived before
You are my life, my destiny
Oh my darling, I love you so
You mean everything to me
If you should ever, ever go away
There would be lonely tears to cry
The sun above would be never shine again
There would be teardrops in the sky
So hold me close and never let me go
And say our love will always be
Oh, my darling, I love you so
You mean everything to me
So hold me close and never let me go
And say our love will always be
Oh, my darling, I love you so
You mean everything  to  me

Neil Sedaka,"When we start a'dancing I'm a nervous wreck, 
Your kinda shaking has a rare effect. 
I can't stop a'flipping over what you're doing, 
That kinda beat can drive a man to ruin. 
Slow down baby, can ya hear me shout. 
Stop! You're knockin' me out. 

Crazy 'bout your rhythm when you're rocknrolling, 
All I'm asking honey is that you control it. 
Your dancing is entrancing, oh, yes indeedy, 
But my one objection is you're much too speedy. 
Slow down baby, can ya hear me shout. 
Stop! You're knockin' me out. 

We go dancing, and everything is fine, 
We're romancing, the music is divine, 
Then the band starts to syncopate, 
You jump from thirty three to seventy eight. 

Spinning like a record on a record machine, 
You've got me going dizzy over your routine. 
The way ya shake your shoulders and the way ya twist 'em 
Starts a chain reaction in my nervous system. 
Slow down baby, can ya hear me shout. 
Stop! You're knockin' me out.

Neil Sedaka,"Anyone who's played on a record date 
will remember stage door Jenny,
Well I saw her last night 
and man she looked like she wasn't gettin' any 
Oh - Rock 'n' roll kind of took its toll 
when she shed her inhibitions,
Too many scenes in limousines 
and dressing room intermissions.

She was the queen of nineteen sixty four
But the truth of the matter is 
nobody wants her any more.
There was a time she could have shown them how,
But nobody wants an over-age groupie now.

When it came to a superstar, 
Jenny was a bragger,
She spread it around to everyone in town 
that she made it with Mick Jagger
Oh - but there's no doubt, when the truth comes out, 
true love will always conquer,
She didn't get Mick, but she got a kick 
and a black eye from Bianca.

She was the queen of nineteen sixty four,
What a pity she became a shadow of the girl she was before.
She passed her prime, it seems a shame somehow,
But nobody wants an over-age groupie now.

Dwee da da da dwee da da da dwee da da da da,
Dwee da da da da da da , dwee da da da da.
Dwee da da da da da da da da, da da da da da,
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

I'm afraid that this morning's trade 
had a sad obituary,
There'll be no more Jenny at the door, 
They took her to the cemetery 
Just an autograph book and a stereo, 
there was no one she was close to,
She was found with her arms around an Elvis Presley poster.

She was the queen of nineteen sixty four,
Tonight there'll be a moment of silence at the Troubador.
There was a time she could have shown 'em how,
But nobody wants an over-age groupie now,

Neil Sedaka,"Try to think that love's not around
Still it's uncomfortably near
My own heart ain't gainin' no ground
Because my Angel Eyes ain't here

Angel Eyes that old devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's mis-spent
Mis-spent with Angel Eyes tonight

So drink up, drink up all you people
And order anything you see
Have fun you happy people
The drink, and the laugh's, on me

Pardon me, but I gotta run
The fact's uncommonly clear
I gotta find who's now number one
And why my Angel Eyes ain't here.

Neil Sedaka,"Tristeza não tem fim, felicidade sim
A felicidade e como gota, de orvalho numa pétala de flor
Brilha tranquila. Depois de leve oscila
E cai como uma lagrima de amor

A felicidade do pobre parece
A grande ilusão do carnaval
A gente trabalha, o ano inteiro
Por um momento de sonho pra fazer a fantasia
De rei ou de pirata ou jardineira
Pra tudo se acabar na Quarta feira

Tristeza não tem fim, felicidade sim
A felicidade a como a pluma, que o vento vai levando pelo ar
Voa tao leve, mas tem a vida breve
Precisa que haja vento sem parar

A minha felicidade esta sonhando
Nos olhos da minha namorada
E como esta noite, passando, passando
Em busca da madrugada falam baixo por favor
Pra que ela acorde alegre com o dia
Oferecendo beijos de amor",A Felicidade

Let others cross the sea;

Of ski trails on the Alpine snow.
I hear them talk of autumn, in New York.

Where all my wishes will come true.

I'm so alone now that you're gone,

Neil Sedaka,"On the day I was born, 
said my father, said he,
I've an elegant legacy 
waiting for ye.
'Tis a rhyme for your lips 
and a song for your heart,
To sing whenever the world falls apart.

Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow it over the hill and stream.
Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.

'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child.
Oh, the lure of that song 
Kept her feet running wild.
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill.

So, I bundled me heart and I roamed the world free.
To the east with the lark
Tow the west with the sea.
And I searched all the world and I scanned all the skies.
But I found it at last in my own true love's eyes.",Look to the Rainbow [From Finian's Rainbow]
Neil Sedaka,"Moon of gold in the sky.
My loving sweetheart said goodbye. 
Those moonlight kisses that she shared with me,
Are just a memory.

By the light of your glow.
Those tender love words whispered low,
Were just a promise that never came true,
For she found someone new.

How, how was I to know she'd soon go,
And leave me longing in the moon glow?

Since she's gone I'm alone,
I have no sweetheart of my own.
Just a memory of a love that's grown cold,
And a tarnished moon of gold.

Our meetings are few and over too soon! 
We speak in a whisper afraid to be heard 
When people are near, we speak not a word! 

Alone in our secret together we sigh 
For one smiling day to be free! 

To kiss in the sunlight and say to the sky 
Behold and believe what you see, 
Behold how my lover loves me! 

Alone in our secret together we sigh 
For one smiling day to be free!

Lost in a city of little tin gods
Cold plastic people with phony facades

Nobody cares if you survive

Where did all the good times go

Come and drive a fancy car
Come and see, what you really are

And you're gonna shake me down somehow.
So what's the use,
You've cooked my goose
'Cause you took advantage of me!

I'm so hot and bothered that I don't know
My elbow from my ear.
I suffer something awful each time you go
And much worse when you're near.

Here am I with all my bridges burned,
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned,
So lock the doors
And call me yours
'Cause you took advantage of me.

It must go to someone, of course;
It can't be a sister or brother

I'm so hot and bothered that I don't know
My elbow from my ear.
I suffer something awful each time you go
And much worse when you're near.

Here am I with all my bridges burned,
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned,
So lock the doors
And call me yours
'Cause you took advantage of me.",You Took Advantage of Me
Neil Sedaka,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, the chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way
I'll find you in the morning' sun

And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
I'll find you in the morning sun

And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You
Neil Sedaka,"Behold the way our fine feathered friend
His virtue doth parade
Thou knowest not, my dim-witted friend
The picture thou hast made
Thy vacant brow, and thy tousled hair
Conceal thy good intent
Thou noble upright truthful sincere
And slightly dopey gent, you are

My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable
Yet, you're my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

But, don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

But, don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day",My Funny Valentine
Neil Sedaka,"Bless the chilly wind that blows your love my way
Like a lusty storm come rollin' from the sea
I see clouds of joy parade across your eyes
At the mercy of the weather I look up at the sky

And I pray for rain
Look for love to keep on fallin'
Baby, you and I keep the well from runnin' dry
And that's why I pray for rain

Long and empty nights of life without your love
Like a barren waste of arid desert sand
Start to flower and the juices start to flow
When I met you it was rainin' and little did I know

That I would pray for rain
Look for love to keep on fallin'
Baby, you and I keep the well from runnin' dry
And that's why I pray for rain

And I pray for rain
Look for love to keep on fallin'
Baby, you and I keep the well from runnin' dry
And that's why I pray for rain, yes I do

But my love for you won't ever change
Though time may go, our love will grow

The little ordinary things that everyone ought to do 
I'm living in a kind of daydream 
I'm happy as a king 
And foolish though it may seem 
To me that's everything 

The mere idea of you, the longing here for you 
You'll never know how slow the moments go till I'm near to you 
I see your face in every flower 
Your eyes in stars above 
It's just the thought of you 
The very thought of you, my love

Neil Sedaka,"Main street at midnight
A chilly rain begins to fall
I move along, a lonely shadow
Ain't no joy in my heart when you're gone

No one to talk to
Nobody's lovin' hand in mine
I need a shot of inspiration
Tell me when you're gonna be
(When you're gonna be)
Comin' back to me?
(Comin' back to me?)

When you're gone there's a part of me
That goes crazy with longin' for you
When you're gone there's a side of me
I can't satisfy on my own

By myself I'd be lost, believe me
Never destined to be all alone
My whole world is sad and empty
When you're gone

Miss you to pieces
I fall apart when you're away
Just ain't the same when I'm without you
Ain't no love in my life when you're gone

Low down and lonely
It happens every time you leave
I need a touch to reassure me
I don't wanna be alone
(I don't wanna be alone)
Tell me when you're comin' home?
(When you're comin' home?)

When you're gone there's a part of me
That goes crazy with longin' for you
When you're gone there's a side of me
I can't satisfy on my own

By myself I'd be lost, believe me
Never destined to be all alone
My whole world is sad and empty
When you're gone

Neil Sedaka,"You go to my head and you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning 'round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne
You go to my head like a sip of sparkling Burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought that you might give a thought to my plea
Cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be

You go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julys
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head
Neil Sedaka,"When I was young, no worries in my head,
I used to flap my arms, and fly around the bed,
Just like a super bird, zoom, zoom, zoom.
Up and down the chandelier, all around the room.

When I told the people that I could really fly,
They said that little boys ain't supposed to lie.
Poor little super bird sitting on the ground,
No zoom, zoom, zoom, when anyone's around.

Fly, fly, fly super bird, super bird.
While you're young super bird, super bird.
There's time enough to wreck your dreams.
Have your fun, super bird.

They said I couldn't, so what did I do then?
I cried myself to sleep and never tried again.
Poor little super bird they woke you up too soon.
No Santa Claus or green cheese on the moon.

It skipped my mind for years, at least until tonight,
When I tucked the kids in bed and I turned out the light.
There at the doorway, you'll never guess what I heard
""Zoom, zoom, zoom, super bird.""

Fly, fly, fly super bird, super bird.
While you're young super bird, super bird.
There's time enough to wreck your dreams,
Have your fun, super bird.",Superbird
Neil Sedaka,"Don't take your love away from me
Don't you leave my heart in misery
If you go then I'll be blue
Cause breaking up his hard to do

Remember when you held me tight
And you kissed me all through the night
Think of all that we've been through
Breaking up is hard to do

They say that breaking up is hard to do
Now I know, I know that it's true
Don't say that this is the end
Instead of breaking up I wish that we were making up again

I beg of you, don't say goodbye
Can't we give our love another try
Come on baby, let's start anew

We've heard a thousand times before. 
She'll tell you how he broke her heart

One more river to cross
Say you love me this time
I've got one more mountain to climb

He broke each promise he made
But I'd rather die than desert you
So love me and don't be afraid

When I'm in trouble and I have no friend

When there is nobody else around 
She kisses me and she holds me tight

turns out to be someone who's not in love with you.
It hurts to love her so
when deep down inside you know,
she will never love you, no matter what you do.

And so you cry a little bit (hurts to be in love)
Oh you die a little bit (hurts to be in love)
Day and night, night and day
It hurts to be in love this way.

How long can I exist?
Wanting lips I've never kissed
She gives all her kisses to somebody else.
She thinks I'm just a friend
now it hurts, I must pretend
The only way to keep her, is to keep it to myself.

And so I cry a little bit (hurts to be in love)
Oh I die a little bit (hurts to be in love)
Day and night, night and day
It hurts to be in love this way.

Yes I cry a little bit (hurts to be in love)
Oh I die a little bit (hurts to be in love)
Day and night, night and day
It hurts to be in love this way.

Her jewels and treasures she found them in her baby's smiles

Two of us together, building castles in the air

We spun so fast we couldn't tell
The gold ring from the carousel
How could we know the ride would turn out bad
Everything we wanted, was everything we had

I miss the hungry years, the once upon a time
The lovely long ago, we didn't have a dime
Those days of me and you, we lost along the way

How could I be so blind, not to see the door
Closing on the world, I now hunger for
Looking through my tears, I miss the hungry years

We shared our daydreams one by one
Making plans was so much fun
We set our goals and reached the highest star
Things that we were after, were much better from afar

Here we stand just me and you
With everything and nothing too
It wasn't worth the price we had to pay
Honey, take me home, let's go back to yesterday

I miss the hungry years, the once upon a time
The lovely long ago, we didn't have a dime
Those days of me and you, we lost along the way

How could I be so blind, not to see the door
Closing on the world, I now hunger for

Neil Sedaka,"Harbours open there doors to the young searching foreigner
Come to live in the light of the big L of liberty
Plains and open skies bill boards would advertise
Was it anything like that when you arrived
Dream boats carried the future to the heart of America
People were waiting in line for a place by the river

[Chorus]
It was time when strangers were welcome here
Music would play they tell me the days were sweet and clear
It was a sweeter tune and there was so much room
That people could come from everywhere

Now he arrvies with hopes and his heart set on miracles
Come to marry his fortune with a hand full of promises
To find they've closed the door they don't want him anymore
There isn't anymore to go around
Turning away he remembers he once heard a legend
That spoke of a mystical magical land called America

It was a sweeter tune and there was so much room

Neil Sedaka,"Anyone who's played on a record date
Will remember Stage-Door-Jenny
Well, I saw her last night and man, she looked
Like she wasn't gettin' any
(Awwwwwwwww!)
Rock and roll kinda took its toll
When she shed her inhibitions
Too many scenes in limousines
And dressing room intermissions

She was the queen of 1964
But the truth of the matter is
Nobody wants her anymore
There was a time she could've shown you how
But nobody wants an overage groupie now

When it came to a superstar
Jenny was a bragger
She spread it all around to everyone in town
That she once had Mick Jagger
(Ooooooooooh!)
There's no doubt when the truth comes out
True love will always conquer
She didn't get Mick but she got a kick
And a black eye from Bianca

She was the queen of 1964
What a pity she became a shadow of the girl
She was before
She passed her prime, it seems a shame somehow
But nobody wants an overage groupie now

I'm afraid that the Morning Trade
Had a sad obiturary
There'll be no more Jenny at the door
They took her to the cemetary
(Awwwwwwwwwww!)
Just an autograph book and a stereo
There was no one she was close ta
She was found with her arms around
An Elvis Presley poster

She was the queen of 1964
Tonight there'll be a moment of silence
At the Troubadour

I used to flap my arms, and fly around the bed,
Just like a super bird, zoom, zoom, zoom.
Up and down the chandelier, all around the room.

When I told the people that I could really fly,
They said that little boys ain't supposed to lie.
Poor little super bird sitting on the ground,
No zoom, zoom, zoom, when anyone's around.

Fly, fly, fly super bird, super bird.
While you're young super bird, super bird.
There's time enough to wreck your dreams.
Have your fun, super bird.

They said I couldn't, so what did I do then?
I cried myself to sleep and never tried again.
Poor little super bird they woke you up too soon.
No Santa Claus or green cheese on the moon.

It skipped my mind for years, at least until tonight,
When I tucked the kids in bed and I turned out the light.
There at the doorway, you'll never guess what I heard

We can't believe our eyes you're such a parent's dream

Then at eighteen months you began to waddle
When you were two years you could barely say a word
But since you've grown up your future is sewn up
From now on you're gonna be heard so

If we should smile with sweet surprise
It's just that you've grown up before our very eyes

Petsounds album. I remember that for two reasons--listening to the album and 
not being sure why a Beachboy song would appear here, and reading a Rolling 
Stone review.
I remember this Rolling Stone Magazine article complaining about the fact that 
Brian Wilson used the song at the end of the album. I'm pretty sure that 
""Let's Go Away For Awhile"" was a Beachboy song from Petsounds that Brian used 
at the end of Journey Through the Past. And I think Brian was involved in the 
album's production. 
Because the last few tracks have the sound of surf--at least that's the way I 
remember it--it would make sense. I enjoyed the album, especially the Buffalo 
Springfield stuff, and because I have been a Neil Young fan since I was in the 
seventh grade when I heard the first Buffalo Springfield song, I really don't 
care what critics say. I try to appreciate his artistry. It's an interesting

A sparkle was in his eye
But his life was in his hands

He used to pick up my guitar
And sing a song in a shaky voice

I guess you won't too soon

When I picked up the telephone
And heard that he'd died out on the mainline

Did you see them in the river?

Brown skinned Indian on the banks

He saw that his brother had sworn on the wall.
He hung up his eyelids and ran down the hall,
His mother had told him a trip was a fall,
And don't mention babies at all.

Ended with a cry,

Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change, come what may
If the good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.

If I get there before the snow flies, and if things are looking good
You could meet me if I sent you down the fare
But by then it would be winter, not too much for you to do
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there

Striking out like a venom in the sky
Cutting through the air faster than a bird

Trying to join their father's castles together again
Will they make it? Who knows where or when
Old wounds will mend?

Are winding their way along, looking strong
Building roads and bringing back loads and loads
Of building materials

Lines between the different spots that each has found
But back home another scene was going down

Of suburban wives who learned to pretend
When they met their dream's end

Neil Young,"Never thought love
    had a rainbow on it
Used to think a cloud
    was a nightmare
That was up until
    I first met you
Now I go around
    hoping you care.

Dance, dance,
   feel it all around you
Dance, dance, dance,
Never thought love
    had a rainbow on it
See the girl dance
See the girl dance.

Mississippi mud
    never touched her fingers
California sand
    lies in her hand
Love her more than life
    as the daylight lingers
Early in the morning
    I'll be her man.

Dance, dance,

Dance, dance, dance,

Neil Young,"I am a child, I last a while
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smile
You hold my hand, buff up my hair
It's lots of fun to have you there

I gave to you, now you give to me
I'd like to know what you've learned
The sky is blue and so is the sea
What is the color when black is burned?
What is the color?

You are a man, you understand
You pick me up and you lay me down again
You make the rules, you say what's fair
It's lots of fun to have you there",I Am a Child
Neil Young,"Who's that stomping all over my face?
Where's that silhouette I'm trying to trace?
Who's putting sponge in the bells I once rung
And taking my gypsy before she's begun
To singing the meaning of what's in my mind
Before I can take home what's rightfully mine.
Joinin' and listenin' and talkin' in rhymes
Stoppin' the feeling to wait for the times.

Who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing,
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing.

And who's all hung-up on that happiness thing?
Who's trying to tune all the bells that he rings?
And who's in the corner and down on the floor
With pencil and paper just counting the score?
And who's trying to act like he's just in between?
The line isn't black, if you know that it's green.
Don't bother looking, you're too blind to see
Who's coming on like he wanted to be.

Who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing,
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing.

And who's coming home on the old nine-to-five?
Who's got the feeling that he came alive,
Though havin' it, sharin' it ain't quite the same
It ain't no gold nugget, you can't lay a claim
Who's seeing eyes through the crack in the floor
There it is baby, don't you worry no more
Who should be sleepin', but is writing this song
Wishin' and a-hopin' he weren't so damned wrong.

Who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing,
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing.",Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing
Neil Young,"Well, I saw an old man walking in my place
And he looked at me, it could have been my face
His words were kind but he's eyes were wild
He said: I got load to love, but I want one more child

There's a mansion on the hill
Psychedelic music fills the air
Peace and love live there still
In that mansion on the hill

Around the next bend, take the highway to the sun
Or the rocky road, it really don't matter which one
I was in hurry but that don't matter now
'Cause I have to get off that road of tears somehow

There's a mansion on the hill
Psychedelic music fills the air
Peace and love live there still
In that mansion on the hill

There's a mansion on the hill
There's a mansion on the hill

He used to load that Econoline van
A sparkle was in his eye

I'm gonna sit down and write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
And I'm gonna try
And thank them all for the good times together
Though so apart we've grown

One of these days
I'm gonna sit down and write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
One of these days, one of these days, one of these days
And it won't be long (it won't be long), it won't be long (it won't be long)

And I'm gonna thank
That old country fiddler
And all those rough boys
Who play that rock 'n' roll
I never tried to burn any bridges
Though I know I let some good things go

One of these days
I'm gonna sit down and write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
One of these days, one of these days, one of these days
And it won't be long (it won't be long), it won't be long (it won't be long)

From down in L.A.
All the way to Nashville
New York City
To my Canadian prairie home
My friends are scattered
Like leaves from an old maple
Some are weak, some are strong

One of these days
I'm gonna sit down and write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known

Neil Young,"It has often been my dream
To live with one who wasn't there
Like an ocean fish who swam upstream
Through nets, by hooks, and hungry bears.

When the water grew less deep
My fins were aching from the strain
I'm swimming in my sleep
I know I can't go back again.

Got the will to love, the will to love.
I'll never lose it, never lose the will to love,
Never lose the will.
It's like something from up above.

I can be like a fire in the night
Always warm and giving off light
But there comes a time when I shine too bright
Oh, I'm just a fire in the night.

And now my fins are in the air
And my belly's scraping on the rocks
I still think someone really cares
And I'll keep swimming till I stop.

Got the will to love, the will to love.
I'll never lose it, never lose the will to love,
Never lose the will.
It's like something from up above.

I'm like a singer on the stage
With the golden lights and liquid rage
Down from the mountains to the sea
Cool running love keeps cleansing me.

It keeps my gills from getting dry
But it distorts things in my eyes
Sometimes I see what really isn't there
Like my true lover, and I care.

Got the will to love, the will to love.
I'll never lose it, never lose the will to love,
Never lose the will.
It's like something from up above.

Sometimes I ramble on and on
And I repeat myself till all my friends are gone
And get lost in snow and drown in rain
And never feel the same again.

I remember the ocean from where I came
Just one of millions all the same
But somewhere someone calls my name
I'm a harpoon dodger, and I can't, won't be tamed.

Got the will to love, the will to love.
I'll never lose it, never lose the will to love,
Never lose the will.
It's like something from up above.

Baby, if I see boredom in your eyes
I'll know my river has run dry
But I won't turn back with that lonely tide
I bought that ticket and I'll take that ride.

If we meet along the way
Please sway beside me, let us sway together
Our tails together and our fins and mind
We'll leave this water and let our scales shine
In the sun above and the sky below
So all the water and earth will know

It has often been my dream
To live with one who wasn't there.",Will to Love

Students study what is real
Someone builds a laser shield

Neil Young,"Across the plain flew the lone grey rider
Leather bang pounding on his back
Above the clouds the moon was climbing higher
A pack of wolves wanted their money back

With folded arms the chief stood watching
Painted braves slipped down the hill
In his ears the spirit talking
As they closed in
For an easy kill

At the house the door was wide open
Wind blew curtains off the rod
She was waiting and hoping
She was praying to her god

He was luckier than most men
He was barely in his prime
As she stood their in the doorway
Her long dress flowing
Would he make it this time

Over the hill in the big green country
That's the place where the cancer cowboy rides
Pure as the driven snow before it got him
Sometimes I feel like he's all right

Sometimes I feel like a piece of paper
Sometimes I feel like my own name
Sometimes I feel different later
Sometimes I feel
I feel just the same",Big Green Country
