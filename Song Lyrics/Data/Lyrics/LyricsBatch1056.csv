National Lutheran Choir,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Footsteps that you hear down the hall.

That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura

Without keys you won't get very far

Mais que amor, devo ter coragem
Pode trocar sua jóia cara
Por três cores de um pôr de sol
Ou seis animais de Deus
Por três cores de um pôr de sol
Se um sentimento meu
For a tempo de tocar
Um pêlo de corpo seu
Terei permissão pra dar
Coisas que não posso ver
Apenas posso sentir
É a vontade de ver o meu povo sorrir
Poder falar de novo
Não me deixe só

E minha vida sofrerá se eu não vir longe
Seu sorriso sob o sol
E golfinhos sobre o mar",Praia dos Golfinhos
Natiruts,"Se o dia te chamou, não demora
Pra buscar o que sonhou não tem hora
Muitos vão menosprezar a sua vida
Muitas setas vão mudar a saída
Um verdadeiro amor pode ajudar
Mas a vida nem sempre é assim
O carro que leva flores na prosperidade
As costas vem atropelar na hora da verdade
Tenha os olhos sempre abertos
Ou o mundo vai te engolir
Seja simples mas esperto
O que é seu, vai conseguir
Se o dia te chamou, não demora
Pra buscar o que sonhou não tem hora
Faça a mente adormecida agora se erguer
E dissemine ideias nobres em versos plebeus
Um golpe que passou pra derrubar
Nunca pode te levar ao fim
Quem tem brilho ainda precisa de fé e vontade
E batalhar que o tempo sempre trás toda a verdade",Tenha Olhos Sempre Abertos
Natiruts,"Cantar (meu cantar), não deixa a alegria ir embora
O meu cantar (meu cantar), não deixa a alegria ir embora

Acordamos de manhã bem cedo para trabalhar
Deixando em casa os filhos, com olhar de esperança
Acreditando que alguns poucos homens venham a se lembrar
Do que prometeram iô iô, na tarde de um belo dia

Guardo até hoje a camisa que você me deu
Que dizia em letras grandes o Brasil é todo seu
Mas só que eu não me lembrei de então perguntar
Se um dia iô iô, esse homem ia voltar
A pisar na lama ao menos para agradecer
Com a mesma falsidade a quem o fez enriquecer

É, é difícil meu irmão, mas se você não tentar
Não pense que eles tentarão, não
É, é difícil meu irmão, mas se você não tentar
Não pense que eles tentarão, porque

Quem te governa não quer saber de você
Quem te governa não quer te ver feliz
Quem te governa não quer te ver sorrir
Quem te governa não merece ter nascido aqui no Brasil, no Brasil!

Cantar (meu cantar), não deixa a alegria ir embora
O meu cantar (meu cantar), não deixa a alegria ir embora

O que adianta brigar por mudanças se nós
Não nos dermos as mãos, caminharmos todos juntos
O que adianta a gente reivindicar se lutamos entre nós
Matamos nossas crianças

Guardo até hoje a camisa que você me deu
Que dizia em letras grandes o Brasil é todo seu

Natiruts,"No seu pensamento sou rei 
E o certo caminho eu não sei 
Há mil formas para sorrir 
Só uma para ser feliz

No espaço lancei uma canção que vai 
Uma linda canção pra mostrar
Força nos dreadlocks que só o tempo traz 
Que só o tempo traz
O bem que ela me fez, a noite toda dancei 
Se a onda não está aqui 
Talvez não possa sentir 
Eu e ela 
Eu e ela 
Eu e ela 
Eu e ela 

Só eu andei (solidão) 
Não encontrei (flor maior) 
Se amarrou receba o sorriso e tudo que é bom 

Dreadlocks longe estão dos seus valores 
Sinais dos pobres homens e suas cores 
Mas a música que te faz

E os receios só se quebram

Para esquecer a dor que os meus olhos não conseguem ver
Destrua o meu coração que estará destruindo você 

Você é filho da terra, dadiva dada por seu Deus
A fome dos meus filhos não será a riqueza dos seus
Ô chama que destrói, corrói o que é belo, tudo o que faz bem
Controle suas palavras, minha liberdade não pertence a ninguém
Mas o amor pode chegar, iluminar e colorir 

Quando um coração está cansado de ver
As lágrimas da rosa ao ver o espinho morrer
Mas, o carcará foi dizer à rosa
Que a luz dos cristais vem da lua nova e do girassol

E que é preciso ter amor para enfrentar o que lhe faz sofrer

Quando chegou em casa e num canto escuro encontrou
A sua princesa e o moleque fruto desse amor
Chorando de fome sem saber que o escravizou

Quero as ondas desses mares
Universo em fim de tarde
Desejo de verão arder
E Jah a minha flor não desampare
Qual é eu 'to na fé, não me amole
Torço e se Deus quiser tudo melhore
Vento veio e levou a dor que já passou
Meu amor

Talvez possa construir quase tudo que sonhar
Minhas chances são de desistir
Ou um dia encontrar
Um céu, um sol e um mar

Pelo céu, sol e mar e a vida com você","Um Céu, um Sol e um Mar"

Quando chegou em casa e num canto escuro encontrou
A sua princesa e o moleque fruto desse amor
Chorando de fome sem saber quem os escravizou

Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold

Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne

Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart but
He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to

Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself

Since we're finding lies upon lies upon lies

Because they've all agreed upon the lie
And it's probably somewhere near the truth

But I'd much rather base my life
Around anything that's here before my eyes
Anything that's tangible
Anything that's a definite fact

These streets are my home darling
That's why I'm with them and not with you
I'll walk these streets till my feet turn black and blue

'Cause everywhere I roam, is my home

When we kissed that night.
I can see your face on every wall
Even through the dark of the night.

That's why I adore you,
Now all I'm left is regret

And I can't go back anymore
I can't go on living a lie
I've got to face up now, it's do or die,
Or I'm gonna drown in these tears that I cry
And I can't keep regretting the day
We wished on a star that's just too far away
There is nowhere to turn my cry for help
And I still gotta live with myself

Here I am missing you so
And I wonder if now is too late
What I wouldn't give for one more tender kiss
There's so many visions of you that I miss
I still picture us walking on down the bay
Laughing and holding you in the rain
Now I know I need you
But baby don't say goodbye
I'm on my knees praying to God

Don't you remember when we first met
Neither of us was experienced yet
But we took it real slow
It was touch and go

And I still gotta live with myself
I'll never love another like you, like you

To get to where I am right here

With just the wind through my hair
All I had was a smile
When I began to lose track
I walked on for miles
And I never looked back

I'm not the kind of guy
To get left out in the cold
I'll walk on forever
And I'll never grow old....

To win all my bets

What if we did what hearts are for
Opened up every door
We could be so much more
What if we give more than we take
What if we don't turn away
We'll never look back and say, what if

If we were one road, how far could we travel
And where would this journey lead
If we were a mountain as tall as forever
I wonder how far we could see
If we only reach up and never look down

How sad the answers to those questions can be?

Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to, do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you there's no open door.",Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)
Naturally 7,"I'm down on my knees will you forgive me
I failed a million times
I treated you so bad
How can you still love me
You wiped my weeping eyes as I cry
I'm so unworthy to be by your side
And I will never forget this moment in time
I'll be needing you in my life

I'll never find another love
I'll never find another you
I'll never find another heart
As pure and true
I love you and everything about you

So lost in a world filled with temptation
I just cannot let go
The ocean surround me
I was sinking so quickly
Holding on I tried as I swallow my pride
I saw life flashing before my eyes
Right then I knew
It was just a matter of time
I'll be needing you in my life

I'll never find another love

Verse 1:
I got a whole 'lotta problems that I gotta resolve
like 4 in the mornin' I get anonymous calls
they let it ring once, they let it ring twice
damm, it rang twelve times, chickens ain't right
cussin' like a sailor, fuckin' in trailors
photoshoots, niggas did it and told me the head was much realer
shouldn't have did it boo, you shouldn't have did it boo
now you forgettin' exactly how many niggas you did it too
cut you off, shit's critical, gimme my space
I admit, I was the one that made the silly mistakes
the Fifty state roamer 
had to throw the fake on her
heavyweight, ringside seats in Nate's corner
wait for her, it might take days
but back home's where the fight takes place
punches and scratches
headlocks and hatchets
screamin' at the top of her lungs, this bitch is spazzin'
comin' at ya, what's up with that shit?

Chorus

Verse 2:
Hugs turn to kisses, kisses turn to intercourse
engagement, marriage, then divorce
devellish acts, sinnin' thoughts
secrets bein' spilled out, soon as it happens the pigeons talk
I try to keep her close by, don't mind lettin' go
let her know who the fuck she wit'
like any Man unless he's whipped
a messy script leads to domestic disputes
all your friends gettin' caught in our beef 'cause they thought it was
cute
dressin' in suits, I used to get you from work
checked your feelings, even flipped on you first
stripped down your purse
one night I found your phonebook
hidin' spots, look in all the places you thought I won't look
never said shit, but dead shit immediate
ripped out the numbers that I needed to rip
heated quick, did what I had to do
sat her down, she flipped it around, looked in my eyes and quickly
caught this attitude.

Chorus 

Verse 3:
Some nights you might talk in your sleep, pig Latin
drunk, the next mornin' actin' like I didn't happen
should I cheat? give me reasonable doubt
is the next Man trickin' on you? huh? is he eatin' you out?
you're poppin' up with mysterious gifts
when I ask you just laugh, brushin' off the seriousness
there's nothin' worse than a curious bitch
with some nosey friends
Six deep in a old BM
pushin' it to the limit
ripped up seats with cushion in it
change on the rug
she give brains to all the thugs
while she drives, somethin' called dangerous love
got a airbag on both sides, no lie
doin' shit the average hoes don't try
want to know why I'll never leave you?
you're intelligent, young, and evil
the definition of a real bitch, some'll G you
come and see you like ""Next!""

Yo, 24-7 365 days niggas coming sideways
not me, some are sloppy
My syyle's sharper than a 3 piece suit
Plus a tie and deeper than the look in a thug's eye
Why do slugs fly ask youself that
Why does Uncle Sam got us held back
My niggas sell crack to survive
Dun, it ain't what you wear its what you drive
Them crackers in the bank don't give a fuck if you live
No affense, but y'all just gotta know that its tense
I'm energized everytime I rhyme I go the length
From point A to point Z you must have slept
I guess you never realize how high my joints be
So turn it up I found a new way to earn a buck
Rapping for the people hustlers and murderers
Doctors and lawers cops and Tom Sawyers
Type niggas ball players earning nice figures
Everybody play my shit loud at every party
Bitches get dicked down
Now they praying that they pregnant by me
On purpose, I be that nigga that you worship
Staying in your tape deck spraying your favorite verses
Again and again peep my adrenalin
Thugged the fuck out
At the same time a perfect gentleman

(Chorus: repeat 4x)
You ain't never hear no shit like this
You ain't never hear no shit like this

Now who else can take a beat like this and twist it
Speak wisdom, and sound clear on a cheap system
It gotta be me you know my policy
I keep you on your toes
Like high heel shoes for real though
Irratating like when your beard grow
Try to trim it
The hottest nigga in the rap game with out a gimic
Keep my hat on matching my wears
Bitches ask me for loot
Only after my deal its all real
Critically acclaim my shit bangs
From here to Quebec
Niggas show me either fear or respect
You can dance put your ear to the deck
either or, you can play it at work
Try to teach your boss
Messing with fate
y'all fake niggas stay stressing my tape
Think y'all ready for hits
step up next to the plate
With your low percentage low value no value
Your shit's slow-mo mine's is thrown at you homo
I don't make the rules nigga I just break em
Rap for the fools lay my jewels out for the taking
Pick em up listen well
Critics predicted since the Firm that my shit will sell
Straight doing it, can you picture me not moving em
You know you love it so much you copped 2 of them",Shit Like This

Ayo many people tell me my style is terrific
It is kinda different, but let's get specific
1998, I appear for the listeners
The hoes, same ones appearin at my shows
It's niggas in this game tryin na be like me
You could see em in the club playin V.I.P.
ain't nothin wrong, all o my dogs came to ball
And when we play the dance floor, y'all play the wall
Like graffiti, changin my style weekly
Niggas know, we recognize cats into dough
We A alike, be	 alike, gotta twist the 'dro
Shittin on my name might get a nigga smoked
Tension when he wit his wiz, hit him in the throat
Like blau, thugs ain't 'posed to back down
Bitches only love them cats that act wild
What you grossin, eatin shit up, when you fuckin frozen
And eat you up like a fuckin vulture

Don't Stop, keep goin [7X]

[Verse 2]
Battle of the beat shit, I heat shit
It's real, five nights straight a steep hill
Call me Mr. Clutch, nigga my game's tight
Spittin out the hot shit, my slang's tight
In the back of the club, spottin hoes
Yeah we drunk, but that don't mean we can't fuck
It's beats like this that keep me amped up
Niggas on the block that need that anthem
Weed be Branson, cleans out the lungs
Niggas talk shit need to bring out they guns
Double barrel, imagine the thugs comin at you
Once you get hit, you can't run the slugs travel
Careful what you wish for, or live for
Goin up against yours, my shit's raw
I'm hopin that you zoom in, soon you'll get the picture
Now ask yourself who's the victor

Don't Stop, keep goin [7X]

[Verse 3]
Ayo imagine if I quit now, forfeit
Or pause, thugs won't love me no more
It's niggas like y'all that hope I fall off
Unbelievable how I show no flaws
Rated retarded, regardless I made it
Niggas favorite, admit it, my shit's crazy
Play it on the radio on different stations
It's something that you gotta have, like immunization
I came too far to stop in my tracks
Probably have a charge if it wasn't for rap
With my royalties, payin off lawyer's fees
My niggas be gorillas, fuck authority
25 to life I can't afford to see
We livin it, meanin my business be legitimate
Turn the beats down just to be considerate
I started something big, in time I finish it

Verse 1:
Lies and rumors, money and hoes
it's the World that I'm attached to, the World that I know
influential, never stable in the mental
but clever, spittin' that same shit niggas is into
I'll bleed for the craft if I have to, think rational
lovin' money and weed, pussy and fast food
tatoo a dead Man's name on my arm
I'm a thug in the street that's still afraid of his Moms
everyday I watch a player get robbed, player get popped
I try to drink the pain away and pray that it stops
in the mornin' head straight to the spot, the juice bar
niggas tried all that other shit and what's the use God?
for the paper Nature takes it too far, perfectionist
rep the bridge, where everything's foul except the kids
we get it on, and contradict livin' long
though the clock will still tic when you gone.

if you fall (I'ma put you on your feet again)

now when you in charge be in charge (you need a squad)
if you bored (I'ma show you how to be involved)
I give 'em more (niggas know they can't see the God)
I can't believe it God (I gotta eat or starve)

Verse 2:
Keep the livest image, high percentage
Four in the mornin', 
niggas blitzin' on corners like the line of scrimmage
convicts turnin' confident
enter the phase of niggas and they feminine ways
love my Timberlands, cinnamon suede
bottles mo' proof
for all the problems that a nigga go through
it's forever real 
'cause some scars can never heal
I'd rather throw the cards in and pray I get a better deal
guns excite me, keep atleast a hundred Wifey's
my duns up in the pens ya'll need to write me
street cadets, alias names and re-arrests
it doesn't take much to know that wrieffer helps relieve the stress
we make moves or get caught for the loot
wild niggas on the block look for more to recruit
gettin' chips from an alternate route 
but the same breed
It's been Twenty-somethin' years now,
I'm still lookin' for the same dream.

Chorus

Verse 3:
In my World police recognize names
know us niggas by the walk or the size of their chain
you know the motto
we live for today, there's no tomorrow
we're only makin' time for the hoes that swallow
fuck a role model, I need therapy
seven nights out the week I jump out my sleep breathin' heavily
keep my head up, only the strong survive
livin' in a Man's World, still belongs to a tribe
took the family along for the ride
watch 'em eat
now I'm movin' with the same cats that'll rock me to sleep
never close your eyes, learn to roll with the wise
'cause some niggas 'll talk shit and play close to the sides
while I call the shots 
and stay supportin' the block
we livin' above the law until all of it stops
I still open doors, a thug nigga overall
and if you ain't know then black Man go for yours.

Niggas that used to be on the block, Ill Will, Marty, Black Ed, yo Son
Mad niggas is gone, rest in peace though

Fifty-Two blocks, Gazelle frames
Bald heads and heavy chains
Somehow caught in the game
Back in '83, before cable TV
When these so called thug niggas played in the street
I used to hear the stories
Live niggas here before me
Like the Rich Porters, the Fat Cats, the Pauly's
Outlaw league, from the street to the Pen
Eyes glossy, niggas only speak when they bent
Off the perfect mixture
Forcin' down herbs and liquor
Only hot slugs 'll hurt ya quicker
Think it out and elevate, I gave years to the state
As a 92-are-7478, it set me straight
The changing of a stubborn cat
The one that used to hustle on the block mad hard and loved to rap
In goose down coats and wool hats, the youth in me
I guess life on the streets ain't what it used to be

I remember
When niggas used to live it up, live it up
Flashin' dough all night
I remember
When niggas didn't give a fuck, gettin' drunk
Shootin' guns all night

Straight shots of Hen with no chaser
Mo' paper, stubborn, hard headed like Joe Frazier
The Gremlins, the pack that I come with
Keep gats by the stomach
Act up and stack hundreds
Niggas don't want it, see me I be the ring leader, Lion tamer
Do the bankhead and Macarena
A black entertainer, bottom line
Ya'll niggas know who got the hottest rhymes
Face it, I got the whole globe on some Nate shit
Straight from the corners to the covers of the latest Rap Pages
Turn the Projects to black Vegas
Don Kingin' niggas, make 'em sign blank papers
It's the American way, do my enemies pray or is it just me?
Hustlin', hopin' the fiends trust me
Talkin' to us, hold up, let me walk you through this
Wannabe pimps, hoes, often shooters
Niggas need to know what the truth is
Fuck the sarcasm
I miss my nigga Mark but God has 'em
When I see his flics I start spazzin'
I learned to let it go
But I guess livin' this life a nigga never know

I remember
When niggas used to live it up, live it up
Flashin' dough all night
I remember
When niggas didn't give a fuck, gettin' drunk
Shootin' guns all night

I used to love Starters, thug garments
Boppin' into Spofford, R.O.R. on drug charges
Writin' on walls, fluorescent markers and krylon
Savin' my loot to buy a firearm
Broken safety, borough hall and Jay street
Hopped the train not knowin' that a fall awaits me
Problems came when I started slingin'
Late night I hear revolvers ringin'
The echos cause cops to start Rodney Kingin'
Many riots, is there any silence?
Everybody sipped Henny, hustled with many clients
Growin' up on the same block my Pops was raised
Rocked waves, blend tapes playin' on hot days
Brought the speakers out
Police made us put the wrieffer out
Peep it, I was too young to leave the house
I'm tryin' to see the World, runnin' the streets without a care
I remember it well 'cause I was there

I remember
When niggas used to live it up, live it up
Flashin' dough all night
I remember
When niggas didn't give a fuck, gettin' drunk
Shootin' guns all night

I remember
When niggas used to live it up, live it up
Flashin' dough all night
I remember
When niggas didn't give a fuck, gettin' drunk
Shootin' guns all night

I remember
When niggas used to live it up, live it up
Flashin' dough all night
I remember
When niggas didn't give a fuck, gettin' drunk
Shootin' guns all night

celebrity getting no sleep
drinking heavily and live the life some will never see

(chorus) 
I got a fist full of dollars (and you talking that shit)
rich rap scholar (and you talking that shit)
we plan to live forever (don't be talking that shit)
you better get your shit together (stop talking that shit)
it's the top of the division (still talking that shit)
knock'em out position ('cause we talking that shit)
anything can happen (so don't be talking that shit)
now watch me go platinum (just for talking that shit)

1's for the money 2's for the weed spot
undercover cops follow me though they need not
it's like I'm Rick James 
caught in the mix rockin' thick chains
from hood to hood ain't shit changed
supplying hits
the type of cat hoes eye and dip
tricking the same loot that some'll try and flip
why attempt to go against the livest clique?
Firm knowing you'll burn soon as the fire's lit
and by the time it sets in I'll be a veteran
aiming for the waistline hit you at the midsection
trick questions for game shows
call me arrogant too thugged out who do you blame though
payroll the whole clique salute the rich
moving out of the hood kids play where we used to piss
niggaas is humorous it's Nature who this?
claiming desperado aim shoot and they miss
but the fact is I'm giving back to the bridge
from the athletes to the hoes and blow trafficers
I'll do anything to be the man
from competing with fam 
hold guns squeeze with either hand
it's like I'm ambidexterous somehow stress this
talking about blowing knowing the family's restless
how many ways can you correct this?
so with that I exit I guees it's up to the experts

Little taste of the old school
Jazzy Jeff, yo, break it down one time

Everywhere I go, people be yelling ""yo, that's Will and them""

Some jokes dropped them doo-doo rhymes at my rest
The B-I-G, W-I-L-L
King of swing, and I rock well
The nail in the coffin of your average rapper
Jeff do the ditto for your average scratcher
Stature of a rapper slash actor
Back to the future on wax
The future of rap

To all those other emcees that be tryin' to get the info
Forget the rest 'cause I'm the best, and I'm a nympho-
Maniac, insaniac, I'll put you in a trance and
Always keep it tight, cuz, no matter what type was
In, you know I'm fresh in flavor
Yeah, that's right, I'm talkin' 'bout me
The R-K-I-E in the place to be
I recognize and hypnotize, everytime I tenderize
I specialize and open eyes, to make you realize
That you've been rocked with Jeff's plain skills
The diobolocal, and my man Will
And we're (so fresh)

Well once upon a time eccentric head shorty
Where people wore pijamas and went to bed early
There was a little boy, tight clout that might sprout
Tried to help lead black folk the right route
Delayed,Negative voices, many, once in prison 
for unwise choices that he once made
Divide the men, cops were sent inside of him
And seeing the good he had within him, let him out again
The life no longer for a big time baller, vic
Big Willies like Will Smith now call the kid (yo Rick)
So check the gift, everything no negative
That's what happens when you 
steer black folk away from negative
Not to mention chasin' charts, killin' 'em
There'll be a member of the Biz-Mark, Will, and Rick
Demise sent, can't mess with the mindset
Come run with us, December 1999 said
It's all because of you, I'm feelin' sad and blue
You went away, now my life is just rainy days
I love you so, how much, you'll never know
You took your love away from me
Oh oh oh oh
You took your love away from me

Confetti on their heads, stranger in my beds
Cabana
Hotel Cabana, where the curious go
Jump in the sauna, let the bad habits grow
Oh oh dancing on the edge
Hope it never ends in Cabana

Let me take you on a journey through these eternal corridors
Polished floors, no third, no seventh or eleventh floor
Founded and built up on a premise of a clever thought
Witness an experience of something unforgettable
Hotel Cabana, José Hosanna
There are cloaks and daggers
There are snakes and ladders yeah
Lost souls roaming round like night owls
So make sure the doors are locked before you turn the lights out",Welcome to Cabana
Naughty Boy,"Feel like a superhero, what type of dreams are these
I’m as high as a eagle, I’m taller than the trees
And I can’t turn back, I tell my heart relax
Late at night, in the dark, I close my eyes
And suddenly everything is gone

I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Reach up for the light
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Devil can’t catch me tonight
I’m not afraid, and I’m not alone
Even if I’m dancing on my own
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted

All I hear is music, I’m losing all control
I have no excuses, can’t say I wasn’t told
If the sky turns black, I’ll tell my heart relax
Late at night, in the dark, I close my eyes
And suddenly everything is gone

I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Reach up for the light
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Devil can’t catch me tonight
I’m not afraid, and I’m not alone
Even if I’m dancing on my own
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted

Feels like I finally finally found it
More than I, than I could have ever imagined
After all this waiting and this holding on
Suddenly everything was gone

I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Reach up for the light
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Devil can’t catch me tonight
I’m not afraid, and I’m not alone
Even if I’m dancing on my own
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted",Lifted [*]
Naughty Boy,"Who would've thought?
See, I never would've guessed
Like pieces of a puzzle
That we would click together
Never was a question of what I had, no
But instead you made me ask myself who I am

And even if they never followed us, who cares
Was it just a fashion fad?
But you were my style
When everyone else was the same,
You raised eyebrows, style

And ever since I haven't been the same
Ooh ahh ahh
And ever since I haven't been the same
Ooh ahh ahh

It's a shame we fell apart
We could've been more amazing
Crashed after we discovered
Our very own lane
You rubbed off on me in ways I can't erase

Not many if any, 'cept for Vinnie, can say they know
In fact, detracting that is something that I rarely show
Because my tongue is actually fast but then again it's slow
See yo (Throw it bro) you say cheeka-boo
A name pertained for niggas who WHO
Who hear that name and place a trigger to the figure who
It blew through and if ya try ta rip, I throw a bigger blue shoe to you
And if you take the shoe, a nigga actor will do, ooh
Dressed to the best to impress but after they try take us in
Crook as a nigga, take a pistol, see who wants to be Naughty or nicest
Like ice is I'm priceless, plug the mic to it
Come with the D with the I with the S to the S's, see whose hype is
Test the test the Treach to Treach address, the address,
How I'll bless and blow any conflicts
Why to try to chrome, my style is just nonsense
M-my ni-ni-nigga m-m-macking so you get out of it
Any and all should fall, many are small should call
Naughty By Nature the creator of all y'all
Show hope, show no hope and can't cope, so no way

Having a round of cadavva, gather matters is drastically
Never say never whenever whether we come on after thee

Leave them ol' cramps in your pants then I belly dance her
God is good and if ya would, you should just
Play to the way I see em, play all day is what He'll bless
I'm leaving em evil and seeing em being a torture with dull props
I won't give up til you had 'nough of these call shots
Now let the hard floor break your fall darling
'cause on the shrift and Naughty ain't waltzing
When we dance we come full-thrust, the bum rush
Knocking and popping 'em up inside, they rocking dawn til dusk
I ain't the type to get suit-to-sike
I feel I'm better than ever before but as a rapper I'm just alright
Showing time is for clocks, knocking poppas
Pop pop ya try to shine I make your heart work proper
And that's comin from the drifter and if ya
Are-you-IN YA L-I-P, you will B-E-G-O-N-E

Nevertheless is definitely hit and hits are what we strive on
We feel this way every single day all day
So make way

Was up to all you MC cub scouts
Grub scouts getting rubbed out
I'll bet'cha kept ya album froze til this came out
Hitting ideas to use, a half of us snit or two
Snatching and maxing a rap that I'm casting, how dare you!
How the hell can you yell what someone else said?
I must get on what I loan, what I own on my forehead, huh
But I doubt that, and now ya want to back out
Your career had more ins and outs than a crack house
I'm macking 'n rackin 'n capping the acts and I wax em wit-wit a smack
This scam he owes must judge me rough with a whiffle bat
And that's simply elementary Walton
So pack ya track and do 5 flat in your Dodge son
Now let my canine backtrack the copy-cat
Your night life is up, so what you had, you gotta sound track
What's all with seven thousand other rappers, groupie
The cut ya made for that movie ain't soothed me
Who said that Treach can't work when he don't curse?
Some nasty ass me, Naughty and that keep it happy
I'm all that and never go out the small way
You need a lift, we go this way everyday all day

Your little tape got more blank spots than a tank-top, think, stop
You ought to store it all, fast-forward 'fore I ring props
You sorry sight, you're a immature rhyme ho
Come rock a lil something, no we're all outta time so
From Chilltown JC to Brooklyn with A-D

Down with Sha-ka-ottin, pimp or, man, they swifting

So that sometimes they do me

We also got the speaker Latifah, the Queen of the flavor
And nothing weaker behind is watching, kick her
The Digital Under-the-Underground, rocks with Shock and 2PAC
With Money be	, Humpty and Jimmy, the master of the charts
And on the tipple several brothers, we muskets
It's Tahid, Akeem, Cracker see and Cee Justice
Plus is the voice behind the flavor unit, all time, all early

Hello, it's '91. Buckle up, guard your grill!
(Har what the fuck?)
Has this ever happened to you?
Can you name this tune?
These victims knew how to guard they grill, this would've never happened!

I put two and two together and I came up with four
You are forever, forgot, forbid, shouldn't have to say much more
I been through more crews than a flute, yeah I'll show ya
This is so damned scrap I betcha bro don't know ya
You tried to get cool and say peace, save that peace for a jigsaw
Stay back and watch a real MC get raw
I never know, never know when another will come to diss this
But if and whenever they come I'm running this merry fist miss
I shooker the crook and shaker the fake to get like a quick stick
It's just another one dud and is dismissed
Kitty guard your grill, well be for real, you ain't built
I'm silly-ho smacking MC's on a ninety degree tilt
The reason that it's tilted 'cause you're guilty, too hard to guard
It's not you're trying too gay, you're trying too hard
How hard can your guard be, I say was up?
Guard your grill, knuckle up, put em up, yup!

[Chorus]
Guard your grill, knuckle up
I ain't the type to give up
Guard your grill, knuckle up
I smoke first, so what's up
Guard your grill, knuckle up
Put em up, you ain't tough
Guard your grill, knuckle up!

I give em much business, an Aspirin
Damn, I love a glass chin
What are ya asking for mercy, I'm laughing
Huh, you know the game, you know the name and you know the rep
You know the Kay, you know the Vin and you know the Treach
There's no sleeping, no nothing, no rest and hey
No snoozing, no dozing, no f'in way
Heaping things up like a Coke cup
Wind me up but y'all I gets the low wits the rough stuff
And after enough to cut ya off a piece, still have enough
Then go around to them and him because ?
I I got posse full a fighters all fly like a chopper
Use to couldn't take em out 'cause they was rowdy hip-hoppers
There's so much gold for roast, the ? don't knock us
My nuts are my only homies that can hang proper
At school I had a lot, I filled with VCR's and Vodka
I had two girls, one a runner, one a trotter
Back then I wore briefs, tella starter, getting hotter
Then I grew yea long so I had to switch to boxers
How hard can your guard be, I say what's up?
Guard your grill, knuckle up, put em up, duck

[Chorus]

I don't lay, I lie, who knows like Pinnochio
Never been to Tokyo or Keeper's Day Bolochio
Guard your grill, here's a feel, I rush hard
I got the fliest ride out here, the '91 bus card
So calling me for a ride ain't the answer
Huh, you want a lift ya better pick up a transfer
Saying we will go for one cut, now we're dead
Oh yeah, that's bout as funny as Barbara Bush in a bobsled
Now how wrong can you be to think we play
Even a broken clock is right at least twice a day
So now ya feeling real low, ya no flow-crow
You slow hobo, stiffer than Robo
Oh, here's another side of being real quick
You might speak it fulla cracks, but you still ain't 
So don't try at those same style battle cry
I rock the you-train, the routes that I battle by
I listen to sister shit, it til they quite slow
No matter that white rap, shoot a Pharaoh with a psycho
Put down ya handgun, up which'cha hands son
Look cops they come, I ain't the damned one
I was only three steps from a peace prize
Pieces laid, piece of his eyes and his left thigh
Knuckle up, put em up, yeah guard your grill
And that's coming from Illtown, down the hill

Give it up 'cause I'm hot wit' a warm hate
I won't stop, pop, til that head is screwed on straight
I take shorts, and no sorts, so take that clone
The only thing I take is the 8 to the path home
And I take you all the way to the north stop

I'm starvin' up, it's time to carve them up, yup

Three steps from a pit, boom, in his chest
I never knew a nigga really wanted to die
Instead he bit, instead of lookin me eye-to-eye, then I
Knew he was truly through, dumb plus the one

Uniquely Yorky, groovy and graphic

Involve the self in, many are melting

Praise is profits, systems knock it 
Who? But this ain't as smooth as I get 
A 90-man clan, a slam jam, bam stand 
And I can can, play and cram fans 
In any form or fashion, time for the cashing 
Throw em rhythm and rapping

You mean he, she, them, him, those and others 
Let's kill two ducks in one, pluck, initiate the trouble 
For those who disagree, I maybe feel the need to front it 
Show me your whole entire crew, two shoes and I'ma run it 
Do you want it? Maybe so, but just know, we're rolling spreads 
You claim you want it but you need it just about as much as a hole in ya head 
This is a flow-er show, a product float a while ago 
With a new swing, I think so, bring it, sing it, act like you know 
And if ya don't, you won't by the time this track is done 
Queen Latifah the sire, give em some, come 

[Chorus: Queen Latifah]
Every time they coming at the dance, what you know 
It's time for rum, man, yeah man 
Every time they coming at the dance, what you know 
It's for jamming, g'yeah know? 
Every time they come, you know they come without the flow 
Soon we have a single, they're the quickest out the door 
The wickedest man, the wickedest man in dance hall, well ya know 
I'm out for rum, come! 

[Treach]
118th Street keeps production, conjunction junction nothin 
Huh, what's your function? 
I don't mean to be blunt or front, true or rude 
How can he diss? Your honey dip looks like a honey dude 
So keep it to yourself, greedy when you're in good health 
So before you come and try the Treach, try yourself 
'cause I ain't having it, remember act like you know 
And if ya can't act jack, you best find the door 
I hate to think a trade, I slot another, see ya gator 
A stam yada, peace!, sasalama, lick em later 
Yeah, you don't have a chance, but I see ya next 
This track is KayGee's baby and he named it ""Def"" 
I'm smoking in em, it's like chimneys, I ain't friendly 
Fuck your fendy, I'm swinging for your diet kidney 
Pimples are simple to pop, I want temple's op 
Then slop your rock wit more flopping than a waffle spot 
The wickedest man alive, I am what I am and I'm 
Damn good to be a no good, hooded by 
The wiggle in the middle, simple to party thumps 
They call me the wickedest man alive, make em jump 

[Chorus]

[Treach]
Getting it and hitting wit it a old fashion weapon when you're slipping, I got time 
Try to stand and get rammed like a Stop sign 
The bad just got worse within one verse 
Put the shitty verse and reverse and this fella's first 
Wrecking is second, so back with ya wacked disc 
For candle after candle and still couldn't wax this 
I be the wickedest while you're still the wackest 
I need wallpaper to list what your track miss 
This is a double decker from the head wrecker, neck and head checker 
Check the check and who's def? Who's left ya? 
Standing back canning ya, plan ta stay back 
I'm down wit Kay's tracks, black, this is the payback, lay back, jack 
I have you every which way but loose, blowing your sound proof 
That's happening to me, your thanks for giving a neck noose 
This comes naturally, all day and night 
I make a party of all lefty's leave screaming out ""Alright!"" 
Talking bout needing a lot more work than you had 
Twelve years, twelve hundred, twelve inches and sold one 
Who's getting done? Who's swifter? Who's badder? 
You be able to get down wit some help in a step ladder 
This is another song, we check out the style that I've 
Picked and rip, I be the wickedest man alive 

[Queen Latifah] 
No rude bwoy, come test the sound of Treacherous MC 
Massacre Naughty By Nature, crew come flec, man, eaze up",Wickedest Man Alive
Naughty by Nature,"Yoke the Joker!

There are too many overnight emcees but one
And too many whacked who haven't paid dues
You have now entered the path of the Flavor Unit
And we are Naughty By Nature, and we will just do, by terminating you

I can snap, rap, pack, click-clack, patter-pat-pat
Take that ass to the point you have to ask for your ass back
A fucking joker smoker, taunted by no one
If I was born in Chung Li's temple I would've turned out a shogun
Smack the any-and-all talk, jokers I can't hawk
And all that shit I hear about me losing is small talk
I ain't a punk, I'll slot ya, furthermore I don't scare chief
The reason I called you 'pussy' 'cause you are what you eat, each
Look is a little closer to the center of a blowpipe
Don't speak when I am talking, this is my fucking shop
How dare you even try me? Don't you know you be funky, while
You're smiling backstage doing mother, ugh, doggy style
Hot, wild, raw, whores' still suave
Check out this style that I've
Soul-simulated, sounds from a stocky
Semi-social, never seem sloppy
See silly slapping suckers, sorry saps and slouchers
Straps slamming stouch, macking this mass is savvy
We see so-so-songs and some shots, so
Snaps stepping separate, start slowly, go solo
Set the cassette stereo, sounds diffing
Stood the Sagittarian, some marriage is a system
Smoke the joker, three times over
And owe her, go with the flow
Or I'm about to yoke a joker

All that straight faced shit like your heart had been through
Smile and give your face something the fuck to do
You're ugly, smugly, squiggly, dilly-wrinkled faced bastard
Someone needs to hit and run ya to run ya ass over backwards
Let's giddy up, yep yep, another fuck up
Grab your microphone, battle time shown up
Any freestyle I see while I prowl
I dial a new style, tell me about ooh-chow
Another victory, it's mystery
I smoke your skull, your brain'll come blistery
All fuzzy, dirty, dizzy, does he
Get the things he needs? Remember how blistery?
You ain't ready for the Freddy of rap
You can't kill me, I step into your dreams, you feel me
Slicin' your life away, just like I might today
I eat you the psycho way, I'm ripping shit right away,
I treat ya like a bitch in a ditch off of angel dust
Take you to a sure you can fly, just jump slut
You think you might say, a rhyme, then someone might order like
You couldn't wet shit up in a motherfucking water fight
All luck y'all, look at the props y'all
So proud I'm sure, suck my encore's
Swinging a bolo, your flow goes solo
I'll smoke ya
It's time to yoke the joker

The only way you would be getting dis jump like a girlie
Is if your father would've bothered to pull it out early
You ain't got a single drip drop, you're stripped of hip-hop
If I see ya disagreeing, you'll be getting your shit dropped
It's extended version, the side you can't fuck with
You'll get the jimmy MC, you're swift to kick the bucket
I'm tired of Mr. Nice Guy, place your price high
Bet on a battle rhymer, tell my chances are sky high
Never would you ever get the thriller, say y'all sweat
""Ya know that kid Treach, I took him out, he was no threat""
Because you know I'm better than that on my worst day
Taking competition's what I do in the worst way

Quick to do a hit, for you most likely I spoiled ya
I bored and ignored ya, then boringly floored ya
The proof is in the footing, my collar ain't wooden
It takes more than an axe to tax, bless the children
Physically, facially, racially made to be
Crazily paid or G, what a fucking way to be
Hot damn, I'm a man with a hand plan
This smack that then attract the new game plan
Eat your big beef, digest the rest, test
Shit, I was slept yet, then go to the next step
That's what I do, that's what I say, that's what I live
That's what I prove, that's what I move, that's what I give
Making other brothers want to go home and write shit
Bite what I might get, then up and say ""I quit""
Me here, got, oh what a beautiful dog
From you ain't in amazing, want some paper plus a pen and tongue will do
Yoke the joker!",Yoke the Joker
Naughty by Nature,"OPP, how can I explain it
I'll take you frame by frame it
To have y'all jumpin' shall we singin' it
O is for Other, P is for People scratchin' temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple
It's sorta like another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missin' here
You get on occasion at the other party
As a game 'n it seems I gotta start to explainin'
Bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number and then you feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you want to know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend or her cousin's house
It's not a front, F to the are to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Boy, that's what is scary)
It's OPP, time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at
Who thinks it's wrong 'cause I'm splittin' and co-hittin' at
Well if you do, that's OPP and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

[Chorus]
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
Who's down with OPP  (Every last homie)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
Who's down with OPP  (All the homies)

As for the ladies, OPP means something gifted
The first two letters are the same but the last is something  
Different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest
It's another five letter word rhymin' with cleanest and meanest
I won't get into that, I'll do it, sorta properly
I say the last P stands for property
Now lady here comes a kiss, blow a kiss back to me, now tell me  
Exactly
Have you ever known a brother who have another like ah girl or wife
And you just had to stop and just 'cause he look just as nice
You looked at him, he looked at you and you knew right away
That he had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway
You couldn't be seen with him and honestly you didn't care
'cause in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finish, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And then y'all could throw the skeleton bones right in the closet do'
Now don't be shocked 'cause if you're down I want your hands up high
Say OPP (OPP) I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount

[Chorus]

This girl ah tried to OPP me
I had a girl and she knew that matter-of-fact my girl was partner's that
Had a fall out, disagreement, yeah an argument
She tried to do me so we did it in my apartment, bust it
That wasn't the thing it must have been the way she hit the ceiling
'cause after that she kept on coming back and catchin' feelings
I said, ""Let's go my girl is coming so you gotta leave""
She said, ""Oh no, I love you Treach"" I said, ""Now child please""
You gots to leave, come grab your coat, right now you gotta go
I said now look you to the stairs and to the stair window
This was a thing, a little thing, you shouldn't have put your heart
'cause you know I was OPP, hell from the very start
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this OPP establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him
Exciting isn't it, a special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta OPP is you with
Him or her for sure is going to admit it
When OPP comes, damn, skippy I'm with it

Mic check 1-2, strap it up, load the beat, cock the mic
And your rhyme better be fat, or you might have to fight
Yeah, there`s no escape from the terrordome
You know I`m nice when I`m bustin' fat rhymes on the metronome

MC`s never pass the mic to the Foxxx, cause
Once I bust a fat rhyme, you be a has-was
I beat you down on stage and when the battle`s over
You`ll be leaving your show in a hearse Nova

I`m flippin' the x`s three times and I`m back again
See, on my way down stage they had me strapped in
But once I hit New York and they losened the chains
I went and bought me a Tec, now I`m wild, insane

I`m on a hunt for a rapper who want to turn singer
I got my beat-em-down bat and a itchy finger
So if you`re nice with the mic and you want to flip
I`m the rap bounty hunter and it`s time to get yo ass whipped

Yeah, I`m comin' from the streets, pop
And please fight back, so you can get dropped
It`s time to see who`s nice and who can really rap
I smack the taste out your mouth, you want to be a mack

I`m not tryin' to shake the water and wake the gator
But I`ma pass the mic like a hot potato

1 potato, 2 potato, 3 potato, 4
(1 - 2 - 3- 4)

[Treach]
You fly high...
I heard your tape, then flipped the next side lookin for the def side
You couldn`t be alright if I erased your left side
Who`s wet dried when Treach tried, next died

I`m gonna slide your wet wide, so step side
Any dull raps get the skull caps pulled back full breeze
Blastin' your ass back at full speed
Hoes in flow, you know, bimbo

And won`t stop prayin' and playin' until I`m layin' up in fo`
Nowhere to run, nowhere to go
I got a solid hip below the belt to make your nuts not grow
Here`s to all crews that been wack

I got a thinkin cap with raps I attached with a chin strap
Flash past your girl who`s def in the flesh
Yes, you can`t believe that she said ""Treach""
The wicked-a-wicked-a-wully-bully

Bad and fully and surely bad
Ready and willy gettin' ???? glad
Dissed in hell and fell in fire
I attack your back, force you to retire with a wet wire

Give you the whip appeal like Toby
Listen, oldie but goldie
Take the dough from all who owe me

1 potato, 2 potato, 3 potato, 4

If a rapper disrespect me I smack him in his mouth
I tow him in a yoke, grab him by his throat - boom! then I knock him out
I keep heat and keep the clips in my sock
When my glock get hot you punk niggas better leave the block

Yeah, Freddie Foxx on a rampage
Every time I touch the mic the police is standin' front stage
'Cause I been labeled as a troublemaker
I send my baddest girl to your house to play the heart breaker

She`ll lay you down and put hickeys on your chest
Then turn around and blast you with a .33 shot Tec
You couldn`t rap, you was wack from the get-go
So you got bumped off by my head hoe

Called by the Militant Mack, my mentality is jail
Long as I`m strapped I can`t fail
Check this, I take the bass and I bust you in the eye with it
A piece of steel with a screen on top, I`m gettin fly with it

I`m bringin' suckers to the street again
'Cause them same broke-ass niggas ridin' on my meat again
Mr. Microphone flipped the beat again
Suckers got caught with the rhyme, felt the heat again

I`m breakin' it down, lettin' you know I`m never lettin' go
I beat your brother down, punk, just to let you know
This is hip-hop, gee, not `hit pop`
You mess around with the beats, get your boots knocked

I`ma slide, I`m in her when I see you suckers later
As I pass the mic like a hot potato

1 potato, 2 potato, 3 potato, 4

Shrimps attempt to get pimped when playin pimp, why
Sleepin with a limp eye
Pass the hot potato, Treach done ???? chop to french fries
Mad as a murder vet, man, it`ll hurt a set

Well, to hell with you and your fat-o with the gurtle neck
So ol` golddigger, dig some dirt, there you have it
Want ring or a marriage, go get the carrot from a rabbit
Before I stab him for his lucky foot

Hit him with a puffy hook, hit the hare, now look how lucky looks
I`m not a chip on your shoulder, I`m a boulder on a path
Left a gash, you catch a headache in your ass
Class I`m disrespectin', I won`t see you trippin', clown

Shh - when I do, you be trippin', slippin' and fallin' down
All`s left to call cops
When I smack you with a leather wig and make you suckers suede bald spots
Chip-chop, flip the hip-hop, I chuckle

You couldn`t knock boots with a muthafuckin' knuckle
It`s on, what`s more, talk and get a boo-boo from your jaw
It`s easy as 1-2-3-4

Too many of my people got time, it shows as crime unfolds
Many snap in a trap now new minds explode
Learn the ability to find their goals
Locked in a facility where time is froze
God knows the heart hurts to see no sky, just dirt
They give a man a cell quick before they give a man work
So we get into this black, this black cat syndrome
Grow older like there's no heart and no soul ingrown
Bars and cement instead of help for our people
Jails ain't nothing but the slave day sequel
Trying to flee the trap of this nation
Seeing penitentiary's the plan ta plant the new plantation
They say we'll take the animals from cottons and crops
Straight to forgotten wit locks plotting to rotting our stocks
They draw a crooked line and wait for your foot ta fall under
Serving most of my brothers another football number
Judges look at our seeds, these brothers, like enemies
Saying ""We don't need G's"", giving out years like free cheese
Free please, nigga, ain't no freedom
Who's locked up? Who's shot up? Who's strung out? Who's bleeding? Keep reading

Nowadays still we're captured, still hear wicked laughter while shackled
We're beaten and battered then cuffed after we're tackled
We're tugged while increasing the mugged and indecent
Hit one more time wit a black jack then dragged in the precinct
Still don't know what the back and forth, looking meaner, meant stripped
Made into a convict, booked then fingerprinted
How many more times of this humiliation?
How many more bouts do we have to lose while we fight for our rights in
This nation
That we supposed ta have since birth
But the breaks on the bricks get worse, so it's jail first
And that's all they offer us
Ain't that right Mr Officer?

The days of the riots ain't retired

The chain remains til we up rise

And I hope this don't suit ya, some work
Like a slave ta get a hit but won't work to save for a future
And that's when the cost is the man within

Around a pound of pound of some shit quick ta break it down
Because the boom-ta-bat-boom-boom makes me want to zoom zoom
In ya poom poom, break fool across the room soon

As we zoom pass one telling me chillin's a felony

Apparently I am politically overpowered, they can't touch this
We'll party no quest', protest show just the slums corruptest

So pump this, bump this, pump this if you want this
But funk that, funk them, funk this if they front wit

Party people if you're ready to rock let me hear you scream!

I play for keeps, sidewalks and streets, we reign and we pop, and daily
routine sweeps.
It's the fanatic, can't kick the habit, so there you have it, I'm a addict.
When I'm near the mike I gots to grab it. 
Rip the system to shreds, grab the braids in my head.
Everybody get lifted, remember the rhyme said. 
This is your introduction to the new episode.
With the Double I countin' down to explode.
Naughty kicked in the door, here come 235 more, livin' rotten to the core
everybody to the right, cause all I got left is my flow. 
I'm floatin' with Boogie Beat fishin' in a record ocean. 
Uh oh, I guess it's going' down, not now, right now.
So I got down with the git down for Illtown.  
Figure it's the fine fanny,
I miss my mammy.
And you could ask my uncle Randy, 
I'm grateful for my granny nanny that's my mother's mammy.  
Two tittle brothers with different fathers but we're still family. 
Forget how rough I had it, let's see how smooth it gets. 
'cause I might wind
up doing that same old cruddy shit.
Like clockin', sellin' rocks in my neighborhood.  
Back cockin', buckshottin', your ass is shot.

Are those bullets in ya bra or are your nipples glad to see me
Been wishing since I'm three now I'm finally seeing a genie
Open that kitty, pretty, let me write it in graffiti
Ya name sunshine, baby, been known by the glow in your panties, sweetie
Your poonany is screaming 'Feed me' so please me, uh
Free me, don't tease me, touch your toes and kiss your knees, ease
Up in it, not minutes try sections of half 'n' hours
We'll be on every end of your house like it was ours
And you ain't gotta suggest respect sunshine, can't get less
I'll affect every part that your man neglects
I've been observing how your curving
Campaigning for a serving now see, I got that pretty kitty purring

You got two pairs of lips which shall I pick to make you wiggle for me?
Adore me, don't let that cat catch your tongue
One time wit sunshine and that snatch could catch you strung
Don't want to wish to hear you sing, want to know I heard ya sung
Here's one free vote for see notes and loose tongues
I'm here, you knock em off but you start with your boots on
A party wit the body, lordy, where only two comes
And the truth is smoked boots is the proof
Once tight socks stretched loose and condoms on the roof
Hitting steep and ain't complete til the kitten sleeps
Between the sheets, now our Naughty emblem is written deep

Blowing up the spot like that ass just detonated
Spouting out sperm, not spaded out, wit my worm I waited
The hotty hair was knotty, a perm and she mighta made it
Plus she had a shitty attitude so no alarm
On a scale o' one ta damn she was a yawn
Darn, wit most it ain't no speaking after freaking
A number one, more weekend in between meetings
But sunshine was pretty as Puerto Ricans, so that thought went down wit the sunset
Now you want to know how naughty can one get
Get strapped up like the Mad Hatter, lips between hips like Mick Jagger's
Do some cabin stabbing like a dagger
Just cool, let's wet up the pool and rub-a-dub
Trade your dud for a stud, busting more than suds in a tub
So I love it when ya let it get it
Get thirsty like a dry reservoir, never sore when I wet it
Say pathetic but I say sunshine is super, put that poonany on the roof
And that shine might wake the roosters, so I'm through til I scoop her
One time with the sunshine

Say it isn't true, I'm so excited by you 
Don't know what to do, you've given me the blues

Got the vessels in my testicles stopped on gridlock 
Now why you want to touch under drawers and tease Treach

Want to shoot loose the juices, the best of hooches 
Blue balls is the sewage, from shit excuses

Shit, hurtin and you beefin cause I want you to jerk it? 
I wish I knew your booty call was a coochie brawl 
I woulda had a better ball at the booty bar 
Balls swole like a bowl with my dick in the dirt 
Shoulda wait til you got up and went and jumped in your purse 
See you felt below the belt, while I kiss it you hug it 
Ain't come to suck or fuck it, shit you ain't have to TOUCH IT 
My thang was cool, takin a nap on my lap 
Then you rub it til my balls catch a cramp from the back 
Smoke the tight sack, sport the nightcap, you spoke it right back

The Feds pick up the balance, watchin everything that we touch 

But yeah I see the D stuck in the V-S-E-and-G truck

My nigga I connect the bottom LOCK to the top of us 

You take the topic, ain't no profit 

But give me a picture, and a compass, and I'll do a Nostradamus

So yo the moral of the story in this game called rap 

Either we all gon' clap, or somebody gon' get clapped 

And I'm not down with that, sure as my name's Vin Rock 

In '99 I will officially re-open up the block 

And dedicate my life to preservation of hip-hop 

I'm tired of seein the people of my culture gettin shot 

And now I must step up because I know that's all we got 

I must do it, pursue it, before all the maggots make it rot 

Hip-Hop, it ain't gon' die, it's gon' diversify 

And as long as I'm alive, I'm gon' promote the I 

And no matter how many people try to use or difuse it 

It ain't nuttin like hip-hop music!!

[Treach] 

Kaboom kaboom the platoon came on in eight limbs and timbs 

Broke rims smoked sims whoop dogs with bent rims 

For the real and the raw from whoo'd up with the law 

I never kill for the thrill but I cut for the cars 

Smokin' budda with a hoota' get better prices from looters 

Shake my shell with the shooters leed a luga with duga 

Some say modeling and acting mean treach is selling 

(man he's Sellin') 

While I'm yelling first a felon with my gat at ya melon (BOOYAH) 

Hella heated, I'm too ill for them to beat it 

We the most cheated most weeded most needed 

You best believe it 

Lets take the tapes jam for me, stand for me 

Your'e damned to be without the jamboree 



[Chorus 1x] 



[Vinnie] 

We've put it down since the days of high school 

and everywhere we Mark we rule 

Naughty's about to raise our stock 

And we didn't come to brag about what we got nigga 

We came to rock 

We blew the spot taking the streets to pac 

You'd be thug-style for a while (?then cold rolled our jock?) 

Using the last few years as our evidence 

Niggas been tryin' to duplicate the mixture ever since 

You live in value reprimanding 

If you challenge me I guarantee 

When we finish I'll be the last man standing 

Fuck what you heard naughty is forever in demand when 

Kay drop tracks all the party people jammin'

[Chorus 1x] 



[Treach] 

I ask the thugs who have mercy in these days is dirty 

I'm still sturdy and flirty till my derby for jersey 

The funk is pass-booted lights-camera-shoot it 

I just did it to do it that's why I suit it and boot it 

Here's the graphic niggas is just tattered and added 

Orgy's are automatic from back-traffic to addicts 

Crush the cabbage straight from the savage to lavish 

We rip those who rat it that's why your click had it 

(?dog?) cats to cuchies for me its lootchie then hootchies 

Cause we'll drop a cuzzie that leaves your whole label woozy 

And shitty and dizzy because your whole city miss me 

And whip out they titties 

And from they kiddies throw me 50's in bundles of 100's 

And make every hater want it 

Drunk and blunt it knock onto the hottest nigga comin' 

Kay scratch and cut ya no matta what you make or 

want to come and touch her the punani rusher like Usher

In the place for anybody not payin-on-time 
Rather be up in a six foot cell 
Before I let another nigga get flagrant-with-mine 
And we be takin' all cash, no checks, so go cancel this 
I know niggaz are so scandalous 
The ones I bust I'ma show em nuff ? on how many people 
Thinkin' that they can stand with this, sheeyit

With the drop-off point (yo what the deal nigga) 
You backed out, I fuckin WITNESSED it 
And have partners have to split shit with 
(Nah, pay me now, bust it) 
At sundown see I went on work 
I sent a tec mount in a tennis skirt, pop the blood claat 
Watch a thug rock, slugs pop 
With every cop on the block, with double-eye on my mugshots 
He better pay me like he postin' bail 
Or send his hand with no nails to his mom in the mail

One steps down the path of poverty most know the route

He grows, she grows, we grow, listen negro (listen)
I die, you die, few die, who rob, its do or die
You fry, I fry, new play, new day, new God
Tell me, what`s the sense of this?
Tell me before they gotta jail me and mail me

You`ve never been to the ghetto till you had to enter this
Some plans, one chance, hold heat, hold head, hold theirs (hold ya head)
Peep rules, we proof, meet troops, speak truth, teach youth (teach the youth)
No crews, who`s who? New day, new rules, do you:
Break bread, wake heads, check heads, half-a-head for steak feds? (check `em)
They`ll lock your body, even gotti
Grab your shotties for an illuminati (ready)

Why, everytime a brother comin` up some pray ya through?

In my face stab in my back man
Rob and steal they want to kill me black man
Tell me now what the deal is black man
Don`t ya know the powers in our hand?
Cause we shine we end up six feet inland
When we could build one nation
And it`s comprised of all persuasion
African, Latin caught cagin`, Asian

Then we can turn hate to love

and get a boot from a lawsuit and a news conference at eleven
Routine stops, how often?  Tri day before last week (word?)
Always tryin to pull me over on these dark ass streets
Gave the war two blocks, two middle fingers like my nigga
Mr. Fuck-a-Cop Tupac so fuck them mug shots that you got
My Boo stops for nathin, know that Bonnie and Clyde
If that was then there'll be no Texas with you Tommy's inside
Chasin cases got that badge and know you runnin the place
But that ain't NAR' a fuckin reason to have them guns in my face
And your attitude's, like you ain't no had no nookie (go jerk off)
Shit, get your sights, get off that rookie shit

Dressin' wildin' up my niggaz ? slice my tuner top 
The streets are boilin' brewin' hot since 1-2 to Watts 
But later we go and party with more mami's than when Menudo dropped 
Take a ride through the buddha block, 360 through the block 
Lock it up, then stop, cause there's two of the cop 
Find a crew to knock I'm in the mood to rock, fuelin' hot 
Actin' like you knew the block when you the cops, two to drop

Was it some gangsta shit, that couldn't been it (nah, that ain't it)
'Cause you bust four shots and still missed, now dig this

Don't know your name, but know your face
You made a mistake now you must be erased
Really though, I'm loc'ed, go, deranged, sick and insane
Drop rights, to start more fights than Mills Lane

[Chorus: Treach]
So fuck the shivers, the Chain Gang delivers
KABOOM!! The whole room the platune don't give a nigga what?
Your whole style got too much cut, nigga what?
Pick up your guns now WHAT THE FUCK!?!

[Chain Gang Platune]
Voluptuous vixen, wear my dime pair, watch it like Nixon
Niggas mad cause they can't put restrictions
They know we fixin', to put the Chain team in the main stream
Cut the bad blood like gang green, lyrical vaxine

Injected by this mind specimen, my Oestrogen
Make the best of men guess again, I'm fresh in wind
Consumed by the date stamp, tramps get amped
'Cause they can't cramp the camp, we leave 'em damp

Got them scared stiff like mannequins
Keep 'em panicin', then we vanishin' into the world at large
The Chain Gang Platune be the head niggas in charge

[Chain Gang Platune]
I serve to protect, self ??? on police premises
Break bones as rug-be-snug, slugs being sold and printless
Stay spittin' at your divisions, hit your visions
Chain but automatic interest got taste for higher proof liquors
If it gets adventures, affective niggas, arrest resistance
Timper screamin' that deaf vast words splintered without the whispers
Connects got prices for product, but Tune fathers vanish
Rock the cuts now I control sonic voices like ???
A thugs' mug shots' worth dollars
Holla, we strange drama killers, can't stop the
For pain is absolute vodka, tre, confrontation watch man
For the progress of nation, yo I'm eatin' through your concentrations...

[Treach]
I'm comin' out combat and com-bows
Competition is a combination of combustion
Too valuable for commandin' nothin'
I continue cuttin' destruction's smokin' or choke eruptions
From California to Connecticut, I can hear the functions
Continue the Lexus, (Spanish) tell them (Spanish)
Category code of the street let's see the next day
The Cruddy Click clicks and classics k-kloaw
Cause it's beef on the streets then kick, kick the cow
Catapult and critters kick 'em, quickers clap
Cookin' trio's like Crio, I'll split that ass that go show your crack
The killer cultural when I'm gun away to ???
Since you got murdered they left you, the bitches who said you deserved it

[Treach]
You can rap, you can sing, see it ain't no thing
Cause every nigga in my click is first nigga to swing
Place the call, make you fall, we can break them all
Cause every nigga we control, first nigga to roll

[Chain Gang Platune]
Guess who speak the truth? I see the noose when the tongue get loose
Neck choke, for the wrong shit you spoke
Took the wrong approach invincible
With the writin' utensil, convincin' you
On instrumentals my moody mental, sets the tempo
Abdul of the mic, but your flow
Slice and dice a extra nice, a writer from the deathest cypher
Jersey believes 'em right, but Chain Gang with the sane slang
Crazy, deranged, strange, with a sharp aim
And shootin' range as deep as Danny maintain gets forfeited
When we show up to play the sport
Niggas show the military support and fight for what you brought up
Play to a good battle, battle and got grazed
In the heart of New Jersey - straight land of the crazed
Bad blood boils and picky goals will destroy you
Fans, straight hand me the jams to unemploy you
Yo, so you better keep it real right and tight
Or that spotlight might only last for one night, aight!

[Treach]
You can rap, you can sing, see it ain't no thing
Cause every nigga in my click is first nigga to swing

While my hustlers do the bankin and the dealin for millions 

My pimps be curlin, crimpin, straight pimpin and illin 

My gangsta thugs on this club on the motherfuckin realin 

See, some motherfuckers got loot to get 

It's just some motherfuckers can't shoot for shit 

So my hustlers call my thugs for the slugs for the hit 

And yeah my thugs roll and shoot in the hoop like a six 

Came from east to the west playin steelo with Beelow 

Niggas fought drinkin corpse, too much cut on the kilos 

So we took every jewel that he just bought from Tito 

Then Beelow rolled him through the desert 

Left him bleedin in Reno, without a see-note 

A section or a solid to sell it 

Ain't married fuck a ring, save the carats for rabbits 

'cause a pimp and a thug and a hustler know 

You trick your grip, the bitch got rich and you's the hoe, woah

Clean diamond rings and suits, we ain't hatin nigga we hungry 

And we'll rob your ass with the quickness if you show me the money 

Call it whatever my nigga but I call it being a thug and a hustler 

And you gotta have the nuts to be both

Drink all the forties up and disrespect every nigga in there 

'cause we don't give a fuck (we don't) 

Just 'cause I be rappin and all my records went platinum 

Don't exactly mean I had to get rid of my Thug Mentality 

But I know some niggas be fakin themselves 

That's 'cause they hoes 

And when they get caught up in confrontations they be scared as hell 

Ain't nothin wrong with bein a thug, but y'all got to keep it real 

So don't you get your ass on wax tellin lies about how you live

Naughty by Nature,"We're in the time where many doors are too hard to enter in
And many people really ain't worth the mentionin'
Thugs, me hugs, and plus a little gentle friend
Or the mentals if I wile I get antetion then
Do my drama from court to case
While others turn they back I turn my hate to faith
that's why I'm here, but boo's, any place or date
If there's tear in my eyes you come to dry my face
Now that's deep, y'all turned from my fans to my friends
After the past, I didn't think I could stand it again
On the streets, me and Miny wonderin' shall I kill
I do for all, when will someone ask me how I feel?
Ladies, if you're down and my pics on you're wall
Just pop in this song and won't let you fall
To all my ladies, got ya letters and I love you to death
Now I appreciate the breath that the dear lord left

Why do I stand for my fam and put it down for my peeps?
(Oh, I like it)
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I see my women fallin' down and put 'em back on they feet?
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I put it down for the streets and my R.I.P's?
(Oh, and I like it)
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I embrace the face that sets the mob free?
'Cause they woulda done the same for me

With the kindness of people and most don't even know
'Cause this wilderness was'nt designed to see us grow
My thugs through the years who've always been true
Just know that I take the bullet for you
Life ain't livin' without givin', worth fryin' for lyin'
Ain't jack for free, but I'm supplyin' if you're tryin'
Have friends before the Benz, respect before a Lexus
Mama's(Mama's) gave us life, but brotha's have to protect us(Protect us)
Some wonder why I still got love
Why I still live in the hood, and why I still share grub
Why I play with the kids, lose money on clubs
To keep my people off the streets and away from the slugs
Sometimes rats run traps while our sista's get named
Sometimes bitches do thangs, and our queens get blamed
But I'm puttin' things on blast for my women and G's
'Cause you woulda done the same for me

Why do I stand for my fam and put it down for my peeps?
(Oh, I like it)
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I see my women fallin' down and put 'em back on they feet?
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I put it down for the streets and my R.I.P's?
(Oh, and I like it)
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I embrace the face that sets the mob free?
'Cause they woulda done the same for me

Where's my ladies who support and understand when
Yeah I'm tired but I still gotta visit the pen
I appreciate you love the love I show them
Woulda want the same thing if I had to go in
Lost the love of my life over stress and strife
If I couldn't care for me, I couldn't care for a wife
So I looked at the Lord and what he said was right
""there's obstacles but everything is gonna be alright""
If you feelin' what I'm feelin', lay back and give me love
So when you see me on the streets or clubs give me hug
To understand unity, you gotta understand we
You and I, you and them, them and me, see
y'all did for me, now I'll bow for the royalty
Just to know y'all is the love the loyalty
Behind every strong man there's a strong lady with 'em
Behind me I seem to have a whole nation of women

Why do I shout out all my women and adore my queens?
(Oh, I like it)
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I destroy anything that stops my teams dreams?
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I see my people is and tell 'em what I see to be?
(Oh, and I like it)
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I embrace the face that sets the mob free?
'Cause they woulda done the same for me

Oh, and I like it

Flavor Unit, it's time to attack the prey
So make way for hip-hop's green beret
Bring on the refills, you see we feel
The name of the brain game is kill or be killed
I'm an expert, who will be the next jerk to try?
Let me explain you got 8 million ways to die
We torch and scorch ya, make ya feel real sore
Have that ass looking just like this boo-boo slipped the door
Known to kill, dunk skills, e-rupt
You ask why? My reply is 'I don't give a fuck!'
I'm a Panther, I love fresh meat
After I kill ya, I'ma leave ya body across 110th Street
My tactics are drastic and real fast
I tie one to a truck and go drag ya ass
I'm more than a threat, I'm a problem
To hell with cotton, watch out when I come to Harlem
So don't whisper or make a sound or croak
Shit ya prop, go straight back down ya throat

Fuck around, lay around and get stuck up
You beatnit, wait a minute, hold the fuck up
If I was deaf, dumb, blind, stupid, blame
Handicapped, crippled and ""pussy"" was my middle name
You couldn't beat me slick, snap that neck like a Chico stick
I know who beat'cha quick (who?), my grip
Failing this to some type of tournament
I cut ya fucking head off and use it as a Christmas tree ornament
Come and give me a test whoever claims to be the best
He's with the 40-below footprint on his chest
Fucked up, got stuck, go press your luck
Both of his legs were found in back of a garbage truck
Head found in the bar of a limousine
The rest of his body at a dove site in Queens
Damn man, Mr. Handman, you like bragging
Ya fucked up, made a wrong turn and entered the dragon

Give me a hearing aid or two then I'm through 'cause I'm that def
That's how we all be, tighter than small leaves

Wait let me hear another tune, tune me in
So I'm straight, if I hear ""drop the bomb"" I have to go
Break this nig' for anytime or any day, as many rhymes are played
Erase, forgive me not 'cause shit I'm hot, if I can get then you'll get got
Au contraire mon frere this is all my hair

This is a story about the drifter
Who waited through the worst for the best in crosstown
Who never planned on havin' so dick
Why me, huh?

Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright now (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)

Some get a little and some get none
Some catch a bad one and some leave the job half done
I was one who never had and always mad
Never knew my dad, mother fuck the fag
Where anyway I didn't pick up, flipped the clip up
Too many stick-ups, 'cause niggas had the trigger hic-ups
I couldn't get a job, nappy hair was not allowed
My mother couldn't afford us, she had to throw me out
I walked the strip, with this here clip, who wanna hit?
I had to eat, this money's good as spent
I'm doin' braids, I wasn't paid enough
I kept 'em long 'cause I couldn't afford a haircut
I got laughed at, I got chumped, I got dissed
I got upset, I got a tec and a banana clip
Was down to throw the led to any tellin' crackhead
I'm still livin' broke, so a lot of good it would've did
Or done, if not for bad luck, I would have none
Why did I have to live a life of such a bad one
Why when I was a kid and played I was a sad one
And always wanted to live like this or that one

Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright now (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)

A ghetto bastard, born next to the projects
Livin' in the slums with bums, I said now why treach
Why do I have to be like this? momma said I'm priceless
So I am all worthless, starved, that's just what being nice gets
Sometimes I wish I could afford a pistol then, though
To stop the hell, I would've ended things a while ago
I ain't have jack but a black hat and knapsack
Four squad stolen in cars in a blackjack
Drop that, and now you want me to rap and give?
Say somethin' positive? well positive ain't where I lived
I lived right around a corner from west hell
Two blocks from south shit, it was in a jail cell
The sun never shone on my side of the street, see
And only once or twice a week I would speak
I walked alone, my state of mind was usually home
I couldn't keep a girl, they wanted kids for cause of chrome
Some life, if you ain't wear gold your style was old
And you got more juice than dope for every bottle sold
Hell no, I say there's gotta be a better way
But hey, never gamble in that game that you can't play
I'm slowin' and flowin' and goin' in on and knowin' not now
How will I do it, how will I make it? I won't, that's how
Why me, huh?

Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright now (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)

My third year into adulthood, and still a knucklehead
I'm better off dead, huh, that's what my neighbor said
I don't do jack but fightin', lightin' up the streets at night
Playin' hide and seek with a machete seeking freddy's wife
Some say I'm rollin' on, nothin' but a dog now
I answer that with a tech, who wanna bow-wow?
'cause I done been through more shit within the last week
Than a fly flowin' in doo-doo on the concrete
I been a deadbeat, dead to the world and dead wrong
Since I was born that's my life, oh you don't know this song?
So don't say jack, and please don't say you understand
All that man to man talk can just walk down
If you ain't live you couldn't feel it, so kill it, skillet
And all that talk about it won't help it out, now will it?
And ill town fell like I stuck-up props, got shot
Don't worry, I hit by a, flurry, and his punk-ass dropped
But I'm the one who has been labeled as an outcast
In teacher's schools, I'm the misfit child and outlast
But that's cool with the bull, smack 'em backwards
That's what you get for fuckin' with a ghetto bastard

If you ain't ever been to the ghetto
Don't ever come to the ghetto
'cause you ain't understand the ghetto
And stay the fuck out of the ghetto
Why me?

And the leaves looking' at the world for answers
The world points to the sun and the sun says

Close my eyes, think what next on my rhymes
See this face in ink, I'm havin' visions of wisdom

Am I seein' death as freedom and livin' as prison
My son didn't have a daddy to shape him so
God bless him with a daddy to save him
Yeah I raise him and pay some attention

He talked and he listened to reach him and teach him
Before I'm gone from existence
Teach him 'bout the foes, the hos and all opponents
Those that always talk 'bout love but never showed it

Those who had the chances to stand and always blowed it
Those that set you up by the hour to steal your moment
Pac the word is you ain't there so fuck the rumor
I'll get a pound of that shit from Bermuda

Farther than it once was I know family don't always
Mean that they blood 'cause some people just
Don't give a nigga what some people tried to use my name

So all the fat we had to cut and I'm still
Walking with my six amp strut
Urban eyes see through camouflage
And now I know who's butt

So when I sent you tried to play me
All of a sudden now I'm shady
Maybe deep down in my heart
Never trust you from the start

Never hoped you'd be my homie, don't come 'round my way

Oh, my girl so fine that you scared to tell her ""hi""
She a all-around ten like a high five
And we ain't fall in love, we skydive
I always get off when she's on, she's there
I'm gone, I call her ""fine"", she call me ""Sean""
And I love 'em quarter G, quarter freak
Quarter Puerto Ric, quarter sweet
Hono-lu-lu-lu out on the beach
South of France me and my Mona Lis
Bon appétit, mon amie

Love ecstasy imagining you with me

Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light
And that morning light is you
So I imagine my heart with you

Cause if we stay our love won't last another day 
Don't throw my love aside 
Because of your foolish pride

Nazar,"Du willst die Welt durch meine Augen sehen, dann bitte, guck!
Hier ist es düster, man sieht draußen den Sin-City-Look
Schon seit Kleinauf trau’ ich niemandem blind
Mein Stiefvater nimmt sich eine Liebhaberin
Und verlässt Mama, ist dann weg, Dadash
Guck, ich hab’ Wunden, bei den’ helfen kein Heftpflaster
Den Stressmachern in der Gegend, die dich testen wollen
Fällt es schwer, wirklich jedem hier Respekt zu zollen
Und mein Vertrauen hat er ’n Türspion
Schau, wie sie lachen, Mann, solange es sich für sie lohnt
Wie mein bester Freund, der plötzlich den Kontakt abbricht
Weil er verliebt in eine Kahba ist
Ich hör’ nicht zu, wenn einer von den Bastarden quatscht
Die waren Samen im Sack, da saß ich Haftstrafen ab
Dunkle Augenringe, wenn ich durch die Stadt fahre nachts
Und der Himmel spiegelt sich wider im mattschwarzen Lack

Das ist mein Leben, meine Welt, Dadash zendegim
Kein’ Platz für meine Träume, Dadash, c’est la vie
Ich warte, bis mein Spiegelbild zerfällt
Gefangener meiner Selbst, Dadash, hier in meiner Welt

Das ist mein Leben, meine Welt, Dadash zendegim
Kein’ Platz für meine Träume, Dadash, c’est la vie
Ich warte, bis mein Spiegelbild zerfällt
Gefangener meiner Selbst, Dadash, hier in meiner Welt

In meiner Welt werd’ ich von Kritikern gejagt
Von einem Nuttenkind-Politiker verklagt
Von dein’ Dutzend Freunden zieh’ ich erst ein Dutzend ab
Wo ist dein Bruder, wenn er grade keinen Nutzen hat?
Das ist der Grund, warum ich Massen meide
Ich seh’ bei jedem guten Angebot die Schattenseite
Ich mach’ zwar Kohle und unterschreibe eine Megadeal
Doch gehe essen mit dem Teufel auf ein Happy-Meal
Kein schwarz oder weiß, alles Grauzone
Schau, was ich heraushole, bis ich in ’nem Haus wohne
Faustgroße Hassklumpen, sie sich in mei’m Magen stauen
Lass mir nicht in die Karten schau'n, Aura wie ein Gartenzaun
Laufe ohne Fackel durch ein Höhlenlabyrinth
Denn ich kann mich nicht erinnern, ob ich fröhlich war als Kind
Um mich zu ändern, ist es eh schon zu spät, Dadash
Ich wurde durch diese Umgebung geprägt, Dadash

Das ist mein Leben, meine Welt, Dadash zendegim
Kein’ Platz für meine Träume, Dadash, c’est la vie
Ich warte, bis mein Spiegelbild zerfällt
Gefangener meiner Selbst, Dadash, hier in meiner Welt

Das ist mein Leben, meine Welt, Dadash zendegim

Nazar,"Ah, meine Gedanken sind düster, mal’ Bilder aus Asche mit schwarzer Magie
Komm’ in deine Stadt mit paar Kanaks und gründe eine Artillerie
Die Straßen geraten in Panik und fliehen
Ich hab’ grade die Scharfe geladen und schieß’
Meine Welt ist so dunkel, hier gibt es noch nicht mal Solarenergie
Sie beten zu Gott und hoffen auf die Gnade von Ave Mari
Mein Block war mein Babysitter
Hier gab’s keine Jedi-Ritter, Dicker, hier wird jeder Ticker
Kein Wunder, wenn sie sich ein’ Dreck um uns scheren
Denken, dass sie etwas Besseres wären
Keine Alternative für Ratten und Diebe
Weil alle von uns mit Verbrechern verkehren
Wir hatten keine Wahl, du Pisser
Sahen keine Farben glitzern
Es war ein hartes Schicksal
Und genau deswegen sind wir schwarz, du Wichser!

Wir tragen schwarz in uns
Leben auf ’nem anderen Stern
Wir sind Straßenjungs

Ah, schwarz ist der Rauch von den Bomben, wenn wieder die Gewalt eskaliert
Die Hälfte von uns, die’s in Zeitungen schafft, wird mit Balken zensiert
Die Köter auf Straßen, sie bellen seit Jahren im alten Revier
Sie bellen und bell’n, denn hier gibt’s keine Masken, die Falten kaschieren
Schützen uns vor bösen Augen, doch verbreiten Angst indem wir selbst so gucken
Träumen vom Himmel, doch nur um danach auf die Welt zu spucken
Atmen Smog ein, pusten Weed aus
Holen Stoff rein und machen Profit draus
Riskieren unser Leben auf schwarz oder rot, auf der Fahrt bis zum Tod
Denn auf Nase wird man Kamikaze-Pilot
Der Tag wird zur Nacht und die Nacht wird hell
Wie Ratten in Gossen nur abgestellt
Hier lernst du, wie man eine Waffe hält
In der Gesellschaft der Schattenwelt

Wir tragen schwarz in uns
Leben auf ’nem anderen Stern
Wir sind Straßenjungs
Konnten nie was anderes lern’

Ob wir grad die Wahrheit sagen, dabei lügen oder lachen
Ob wir krank oder gesund sind, arm oder reich
Jeder kriegt, was er verdient Frage der Zeit
Bilder unsrer Kindheit verblasst mit Schmerz
Vertrauten wir dann blind unserm Hass im Ernst
Dein Kopf war gefickt, Zukunft war grau
Yallah, yallah, Zukunft war tschau
Hass im Herzen und ein Loch in unserm Bauch
Hast du Feuer in der Brust, bleibt im Kopf dir nur der Rauch
Also raus auf die Straße mit der Knarre ins Gesicht
Kleine Päckchen verpackt und die Ware dann vertickt
Wallah fick dich, du Piç, wenn du uns nicht verstehst
Wir bekam’ nichts geschenkt, deshalb bunkern wir Haze
Wir sind die Generation mit Hass in der Brust
Unsre Träume zerfielen hier zu Asche und Schutt

Wir sind Guerilla wie die Viet Cong
Und man kann uns nur verstehen, wenn man von hier kommt

Guck, wie die Gegend hier zu Bruch geht
Ja, die Hood prägt es gab kein’ Fluchtweg
Und die Brust bebt, weil sich nie der Frust legt
Es sei denn, wenn man irgendjemanden kaputtschlägt
Das ist das Leben auf der Straße, wir reden wie der Pate
Wir legen auf, gehen raus, geben auf die Nase
Leute so wie ich haben dein Business gefickt
Dich im Studio besucht und dein Equipment gerippt
Wir machen nicht viel außer Bitches zu checken
Jibbets zu plätten und Tipico-Wetten
Das schneeweiße Koks, um ein Drittel zu strecken
Und Testo zu spritzen auf Fitnesstoiletten
Patrouillieren auf der Straße in Air-Max
Ficken deine Mutter, denn dein Vater hat Herpes
Ihr seid Opfer und saugt an der Bier-Bong

Nazar,"Ich kann meine Emotionen nicht im Streit kontrollieren
Deshalb werden Diskussionen oft zu Thaibox-Turnieren
Ich hab’ Jünger, die die Texte auf dem iPod studieren
Weshalb mich jetzt Leute bei der Polizei observieren
In der Zeitung steht fest mein Einfluss ist schlecht
Nach dem Album ändern sie das Polizeischutzgesetz
Dabei will ich doch nur spielen, mach’ paar Mille mit ’nem Deal
Und bring’ Mama dann auf Händen in ein Villendomizil
Schon seitdem ich mich beweg’ hat die Gegend mich geprägt
Ich hab’ Kilos hier gepusht - was für Training am Gerät?
Meine Kanaks tragen Bauchtaschen als Modeaccessoires
Als ob niemand checken würde, dass ihr Drogen darin habt
Ich hab’ circa 20.000 in den Hosentaschen bar

Auf manche wirken die Verhaltensweisen krank
Wir sind gewaltbereit und schließen und schließen uns der falschen Seite an
Schlägereien mit Cops, wir geben keinem Propz
Jeder Gegner wird vorm Frühstück schon ins Pflegeheim geboxt
Sowas wirkt auf mich entspannender als Tantramassagen abends
Ich steh’ auf Französisch, so wie Champagner-Markennamen
Und Kahbas denken, sie sind Megan Fox
Gut, wir sind Model-Scouts und geben ihn’ ’nen echten Job
Ich kam vom Wettbüro zu 100.000-Cash-Depot, zu Rap-Millionen
Gerechter Lohn, mach mal nicht auf Player hier in Jack & Jones
Geh mal Zigaretten holen und tu was für dein King
Meine Knie aus Titan, weil sie jetzt kugelsicher sind
In unseren Etablissements waren nie Rapper willkommen
Was für Restaurant? Diese ? fressen Beton
Nach dem Beef wirst du Piç nie mehr wieder gesehen

Meine Mucke bleibt zu wild, denn ich spucke ein paar Silben
Und ihr macht keinen Piep mehr wie kaputte Einparkhilfen
Guck, wie ich problemlos deinen Bodyguard zerlege
Und der Arzt stellt fest, er hat geplatzte Kapillargefäße
Fick dein’ Promostress, du Clown, Homo-Rap ist out
Bevor du mit mir redest, zieh dein’ Yolo-Sweater aus
Wir sind hungrige Hyänen, ich bin Pate der Straßen
Bin kein Viehtransporter, doch hab’ die Scharfe geladen

Wenn ich austick’, entspreche ich wieder mal ihren Kanaken-Klischees
Also lauf’ ich im Laden zum Händler, der mich zu den Waffen berät
Und er sagt mir, ich solle die Kalash nehm’, denn diese ballert extrem
Und es ist keine Phrase, wenn ich sage, ich habe mein Leben riskiert
Ich kam aus dem Nichts, hab’ Gewinne gemacht und dann reinvestiert

Ich fühl’ mich wie ’n Pitbull im Käfig, denn ich hab’ zu lange gehungert
Sah die andern sich satt essen im Restaurant mit Champagner und Hummer
Bin derselbe von damals, doch werde ich heute von andern bewundert
Und bin bereit für den Tod, solang Mama ’nen Wunsch hat
Fress’ den Rest hier wie Pac-Man auf, vercheck’ die Packets im Treppenhaus

Der Bezirk, in dem man keine Weltwunder sieht
Schon als Kind wird man gezwungen, sich hier selbst zu erziehen
Das ist Favoriten, Oida, F-A-K!
Hier hat jeder ein paar Waffen in sei’m Repertoire
Hier hältst du deine Schnauze, bevor dich ein Piti beißt
Hier ist man Döner, Schnitzel und Tichy-Eis
Hier gibt es Türken, Jugos, Albaner und Tschetschenen
Kurden, ich brauch’ meine Iraner nicht erwähnen
Was für Touris? Hier werden Japaner nie gesehen
Hier verkaufen Araber das Asia-Buffet
An alle meine Österreicher aus der Nachbarschaft

Kann schon sein, dass dir das alles nicht gefällt

In meinem Viertel ist die Welt noch in Ordnung
Hier fährt niemand in ’nem älteren Ford rum
Häuser, Terrassen und teurere Sachen
Statt Mäuse und Ratten und Träume, die platzen
Hier entspannt man im Champagnerbad
Die Schule fährt nach Saint-Tropez am Wandertag
Diese Gegend ist bei Yuppiebonzen angesagt
Ein Platz für Atzen, denn hier wohnt man, wenn man Money mag, eh
Hier gibt’s zum Brunch erstmal anständig Sektempfang
Ganz sicher hier bin ich langfristig besser dran
Ungeziefer hat in meinem Garten nichts verloren
Alarmanlage nur wegen dem Schwarzgeld im Tresor
Im Panamera pump’ ich Mozart und Lang Lang
Hier kann das Wochenende montags schon anfangen

Und auf der Party immer noch so hacke das wir kotzen
Ich nehm’ ein Messer in der Daunenjacke mit

Immer noch Ayran und Waffen in den Socken
Und auf Partys nur Kanaken, die sich boxen mit Ochsen

Nazar,"Seh' wie die Zeit vergeht und sich der Zeiger dreht
Die Zukunft die wir geplant hatten haben wir beide leider weit verfehlt
Jede zweite Chance und jeder Streit umsonst
Du warst der Grund für die Melancholie in meinen Songs
Wir hielten zusammen, kämpften gegeneinander
Doch es gab zu viele Gründe weshalb ich dich dann aus meinem Leben verbannt hab'
Denn ich sah' dich in Träumen, doch war blind vor Liebe
Es war ein Tanz mit dem Teufel es noch hinzubiegen
Wir haben nach Freiheit verlangt doch waren beide gefangen
Es gab keinen Grund für einen Seitensprung, nur in deinem Verstand
Wir sind Fremde geworden, die sich sehr gut kennen
Denn Gewohnheit und Sehnsucht, waren immer schwer zu trennen

Und selbst wenn wir es gut machen
Könnten wir es dann vielleicht nie wieder gut machen
Ey, vielleicht sollten wir alte Träume ruhen lassen
Bevor sie uns verfolgen und nie wieder ruhen lassen
Denn wir sind, wir sind, nicht für einander bestimmt
Wir sind, wir sind, nicht für einander bestimmt
Wir sind, wir sind, nicht für einander bestimmt
Wir sind nicht für einander bestimmt, wir sind

Wir sind verschiedene Menschen doch trotzdem auch irgendwie eins
Andere Mentalität doch trotzdem auch irgendwie gleich
Wir haben gemeinsam gewonnen doch heute verlieren wir uns zwei
Denn egal was wir taten, es hat nie wirklich gereicht
Wir hielten so fest an dem Fallschirm im Biz, unser Band riss
Du hattest ständig die Angst das ein anderes Leben für mich interessant ist
Seh' dich lachend auf Fotos, doch weiß das du weinst
Die gemeinsame Zeit nutzten wir nur nicht alleine zu sein
Sag wo sind wir jetzt? Und wo waren wir davor?
Schau ich bin schon weg, und du mit der Lage d' accord
Wir sind Fremde geworden, die sich sehr gut kennen

Jung und Dumm, statt Smart und Reif

Treffen keine Entscheidung, wählen zwischen Kalt und Heiß
Wir sind Venus und Mars, Quadrat und Kreis
Es war ein schmaler Grat zwischen Knast und Frei
Wir sind Freund oder Feind, Arm oder Reich
Wir haben nie wirklich gewusst
Ist es wahr oder Schein?

Sag dem DJ, er soll Cheb Khaled spielen
Check! Ich rappe für Siri acht Bars
Ihre Antwort „Bikini-Kahbas“
Du Teenie-Kahba, mach mir nicht auf Milf
Ich komme aus der Wüste, ich hab’ Staub auf dem Grill
Puh, bevor du Schwuchtel hier schief guckst
Dreh’ dich um und hol mal lieber tief Luft
Sag mir bitte, wie viel ist der Beat wert?
Almaz auf dem T-Shirt, mach mir nicht auf Spielberg
Meine alten Manager sind jetzt angepisst
Fick dein’ Vertrag weil es nicht „Straight Outta Compton“ ist
Ich ficke deine Frau, während du am tanzen bist
Meine Biographie vom Leben aus ins Rampenlicht

Bevor ich dein’ Leichnam in Plastik verpacke
Gib mir besser zackig die Patte!
Ich hol’ mir heute, was ich nie hatte

Meine Gang ist zu verrückt und sie ersticht dich mit ’nem Tacker
Tequilarausch, wir rasten wieder aus
Und deine Freundin saugt am Schwanz wie an ’nem Shishaschlauch
Sieh zu, wie’s mit den Brüdern wieder Stress gibt
Auf Kriegsfuß mit den Hütern des Gesetzes
Und dabei ist mein Leben eigentlich schön
Denn meine Zukunft ist blendend und meine Scheiben getönt
Und dennoch bleib’ ich im Herzen im 10. Bezirk
Weil jedes Wort, was ich sage, hier in der Gegend regiert, ah
Also komm mir nicht mit Bruderkuss
Oder dein Face wird verziert mit meinem Schuhabdruck
Und mach hier nicht auf Usher oder Sisqó
Du bewegst dich wie ein Bastard in der Disco

Zur Seite mir dir, zack, zur Seite mit dir, ja

Wer will ficken, bitte schick dir Kahba her
Jede Dorfschlampe denkt, sie wär’ Iggy Azalea
Yeah, ich ex’ die Whiskeyflasche leer
Und benehme mich als ob ich grad im Mittelalter wär’
Ey ja, ich komm mit Ochsen wie Farmer
Wenn ich dich box’, ist es Karma
Ich kenne deine Fotze von damals
Du Opfer, ich stopf’ dir das Loch wie ein Zahnarzt
Figur wie ’ne Heldengestalt
Nach einer Flasche Vodi fick’ ich den incredible Hulk
Eine Schelle es knallt und der Spuk ist vorbei
Rapper sind nur hart während der Studiozeit
Schön, dass du dich jetzt wie Drake bewegst
Aber trauer, dass bei dir dann nichts mit Mädchen geht

Wie Bombenentschärfer in Stalingrad, ich schieß jetzt Zeilen wie diese
Sie ducken sich, ich spucke Gift, das ihre ganze Truppe fickt
Sie mucken nicht, sie wissen, ich mag ihren Look plus Mucke nicht
Ich bin Legende, schau, ey, ging independent auf 10
Muss grinsen, wenn ich Clowns seh, die sprinten, wenn ich Faust geb
Ich brech Ochsen 6 Knochen, wollt ihr nicht mal wegboxen?
Wollt ihr nur zurechtklopfen, merkt ihr, das sind echt Fotzen
Jetzt muss ich den Anwalt zahl'n, doch das sind Geschäftskosten

Damals als ich mich nicht auf mein Ego verlies
Eingesperrt in einem Ego-Verlies
Hindert mich nicht daran, dass ich mein Leben genieß!

Und ob ich es irgendwann zu denn Sternen hin schaffe
Also drückte ich auf die Springtaste, wollte meinen Highscore
Kämpfte gegen Cyborgs und kam mir dabei frei vor
War nur in nem kleinen Dorf, verglichen mit dem All
Ein schwarzes Loch, ich sah nur die Risse im Asphalt
Ich wusste nicht, wie ich meinen Traum Wahr mach
Und war kaum nahrbar, wie ein Raumfahrer
Yeah, in dunklen Stunden, wollt mich Luzifer zum Sohn
Doch die Hölle ist unten, ich wollte zum Jupiter und Mond
Und wo ich gerade steck, ich bin Lichtjahre weg
Von dem Rest, als ob ich jetzt zur Milchstraße jet

Immernoch die teuerste Rose, ohne das Wasser verwelkt ist
Ich wär gern in ner Galaxie, in der Papa der Held ist
Bau ein Raumschiff aus Erinnerungen, aber es hält nicht
Ich machte mir über die Ewigkeit gedanken
Die Fantasie ist Freiheit, so als geb es keine Schranken
Ich lege meine ganze Angst in Gottes Schoß
Denn Gott ist groß und ich jogge los
Ihr könnt mit Mund aufstarren, ich hab den Grundbauplan

Nazar,"Ich hab euch mitgenommen in meine Welt, Fakker Lifestyle
Und verbeuge mich vor euch, jetzt heißt es yala Bye Bye
Alles was ich hatte, hab ich rein investiert
Mit dem Risiko, das diese Show kein interessiert
Doch dank eurer Treue bin ich bis hier her gekommen
Wüstenblume war wohl mein schwierigster Song
Den das was ich sage ist tausend Prozent
An mich glauben die Fans und n haufen Cousin
Früher hab ich ein paar Bullen weg geklatscht
Und hab ich danach mein Leben in ? verpasst
Eyo D-Bo mein Bruder, ich schulde dir was
Denn nach dem Album, haben's auch die Nullen jetzt gerafft
Wolfpack ist macht und ich danke den Fans
Fakker sind stärker als die anderen Gangs
An die Hater, ich weiß das es Hassliebe ist
Wenn ich sterbe, dann als Held ich verabschiede mich, also

Und fickt Deutschrap weg jetzt im Wasserbett
Beim Tantrasex, bitte weitersagen
Denn diese Opfer sind softer als Thai Massagen
Was für Maybach parken, was für zweifach Platin
Ihr könnt einpacken so wie vor dem Weihnachtsabend Ey
Guck doch wie ich Rapper kurz ermorde
Und sie blasen mir wie bei einer Geburtstagstorte
? Porsche, ich hab Karren am Start
Diese Hinterwäldler sagen sie haben Knarren parat
G-G-Guck wie die Deppen sich hinter Muskeln verstecken
Und mir erzählen wollen das sie öfter Schutzgeld erpressen
Schnee von Gestern wie ihre Koksreste
Sie halten sich nun über Wasser, Bootsweste
Ich war kein Musterschüler denn man dann fürs College entdeckte
Mache Steuerfreies Cash wie die Scientology-Sekte

Ihr könnt kommen aber bleibt nicht lang da
Geht verschollen wie der Heilige Gral
Ich bring euch jetzt wieder zum schweigen wie ein Grab

Mach so weiter und lande im eisernen Sarg
Das Problem und die Lösung, bleibt hier Nazar!

Eure Texte sind das letzte wie das Sarrazin Buch
Ich baller die Crews weg jetzt im Palestin Tuch
Mach eine schwule Bewegung und es heißt gute Genesung
Rapper ficken ihren Buisness aber suchen den G-Punkt
Penner was für Rap-Baba, N A zu dem Z Fakker
Bange deine Banger und schwänger deine Ex, Sucker! Ah
Ihr seid Minusmenschen
Die nur andere Rap Leichen auf dem Friedhof schänden
Okay, ziehe die Jogginghosen aus
Schnapp mir paar Sluts, hau die Bodylotion drauf
Guck mich an, so sehen Pop-Ikonen aus
Du hebst die Faust doch gehst dann in der Rocky-Pose drauf
Stopf dein loses Maul mit Chloroform-Lappen
Guck Kanacken tragen Kutten über Polo-Sport Jacken
Jap, ich hustle und befriedige mein ? lieber
Bis ich grün anlaufe wie ein Celtic Spieler

Curtains and flowers in her hair

Mist upon the hill that once flowed with blood,
Helped to cover up an approaching army,
Hid the killing lust in the eyes of men.

Sitting by the fire was a sentry sleeping,
Rolled up in their beds were children that play,
Unsuspecting what was to fall upon them,
None of them would see the dawn next day.

Bloody were the blades that fell on children,
Hate the blinding light tried to kill a name,
The mountains only know all the souls that died there,
Glen Coe from that day can recall the shame.

Is made out of turnip greens

That you've been walkin' through cotton fields
Oh, you're some down home girl
Your shoes are green, your dress is red
And your wiggy head is powder blue
But underneath all of that mess,
Well you're still the same old messy you
You're sittin there in that fancy chair
Just drinkin' champagne like a movie star
When ya oughta be sittin' on a sidewalk
Drinkin' white lightnin'
Out of a jelly jar
Oh, you're some down home girl
Dimples in your pretty cheeks
And dimples in your knees
You walk by and baby I
Can smell magnolia trees
You tell me you're from New York baby

And the perfume he wore lingers on the king's road

Your hot rod , space pod, tax relief, kill machine
Is looking mean
And should be working well

Send me down a simple solution
Send me down a simple solution now

When the beach boys sang about good vibrations

You can count the reasons why youve thrown it away
You can dream your life away without me
But youll never know how much I needed you

You can laugh at me because Im crying
You can tell your friends how much
I begged you to stay
You can live your fantasy without me

I need you
You have your heartaches to climb

I just hope that you still have,
That you still have your dreams.

Are only for the few

We got right on our side

Count the size of the threat

You think you got the time

Better get it right first time

I had a dream
I saw the mission band, playing on the green
It was the saddest thing, I have ever seen
What did it mean, what did it all mean?

I saw the soldiers marching, on the green
The band played a funeral march
Many a tear was seen
All in my dream, all in my dream

Red eyes staring me out
Strange feelings comin' down tonight
Can't quite figure it out
Fit your alibi before your crime
No need in serving no time
Case you scam, or you'll get rammed
Stretched out on that line

Hangin' out at a shooting site
Cold turkey calling a tune
All the answers coming late tonight
Try to look like you're immune
In your eyes you can feel the heat
But the feelings outa touch
You're working on just a holding on
You're hurtin' oh so much

Feel the city heartbeat, feel the pulse in the streets
Can you feel the city heartbeat, can you feel the pulse in the streets
Can you feel your own heartbeat
Can you feel your blood begin to heat?

Call off your dogs 'cause I am no fox
Turn off your white light
My alibi is rock tight
Your night stick, cheap trick is pullin' me in
Your monkey suit, stage fright, black and white blue suit, law suit
Is wearin', mighty thin

Feel the city heartbeat, feel the pulse in the streets
Can you feel the city heartbeat, can you feel the pulse in the streets
Can you feel your own heartbeat
Can you feel your blood begin to heat?

Borstal boy laughing at justice now he's a star
And the perfume he wore lingers on the king's road
Like a whore
Legs wrapped around a plastic stool
He's making more in one day
Than you've had.......hot, hot dinners

Call out your legions, the savior is loose
Telling true stories you know that ain't no use
Your empire is burning you can feel the smell
Your hot rod , space pod, tax relief, kill machine
Is looking mean
And should be working well

Feel the city heartbeat, feel the pulse in the streets
Can you feel your own heartbeat
Can you feel the pulse in the streets
Can you feel your own heartbeat
Can you feel your blood begin to heat?

Nazareth,"Sent a telegram today
Tomorrow you’ll be on your way
Could be Memphis or L.A.
No questions just get out and play

Wake up call to catch the plane
You know you’re on the road again
Someone’s bangin’ in your head
Why did you get so late to bed?

Runnin’ late and feelin’ bad
That breakfast was the worst you’ve had
Make the gate no time to spare
Before you know you’re in the air

747 flies us high
Much higher than we’re meant to be
You’re six miles high but feelin’ down
You wish you could be on the ground

Find your bags and walk for miles
The customs man is waitin’ there
Immigration cause delay
You wonder, if you’ll ever play

Limousine is standin’ by
We get inside and drive a while
F.M. station soundin’ good
And gettin’ better every mile

Hotel lobby looks the same
With all the same old girls in town

Press reception takes the day
With all the same old things to say
Need your picture, smile this way
And will you tell me what you play

So, you wanna be a rock 'n' roll star
Just listen now to what I say
Get yourself an electric guitar
And take some time and learn to play

Your roadies call to say okay
The sound check can get underway
Sound check over, had some fun
A waste of time for everyone
Time has come to start the show

It's boogie time for everyone
Check guitars before you go
They’re close enough for rock 'n' roll
The lights are low

The crowd is high, much higher than
They're meant to be
We take the stage and start to play
The lights come up for all to see

Here we are again, singin' the same old songs
Lookin for someone who will sing along
Here we are again playin' the same old scenes
Lookin' for someone who will share our dreams
Here we are again facing the same old sights
Lookin' for someone who will share our nights

Nazareth,"Every single day
I think of the times
When you were still mine
And I'm blue

Got to get away
Get you out of my mind
I'm caught up in time
And I'm blue

I don't miss all the fun that we had
You were always around me

It would be alright

I know I'm to blame
I'm locked in my chains

Fallen like a stone
I'm down on the ground

Understand that there's no other if there is just
A few staying true like you never breaking
No rule lord forgive me for the things I have done
To you if you weren't up in my life I wouldn't know

But you been strong and stood by me every step-a-the-way,
I thank the lord for the day he brought you into my life,
Changed my world -my destiny - and gave me new life,
So if you got somebody special - that's always been true,
Show love and take note in everything that they do,
I could neva take fjor granted what she's done for me,
Even when we desagree she still stands by me,
Late night - road trips- showin' mad support,
The typa-girl-that every homie should be keepin' close,
'cause your that typa-a-girl that neva let me down,
Encouraged me to see the light when no one else would come
Around, down when I had money- and down when I was broke,
So if I die tonight hold me tight and don't let go!
I guess that you can say I owe my life to you the
Only dream that really matters is to be with you cuzz
Even though we argue and we fight some times
you'll always be my queen until the end of times

Just you and me
Will you runaway with me

The day I wrote these words for you I cried
Could of died that day a happy and complete man
'cause in the palm of my hands
Everything that I dreamed for and more
And you know I'm down for yours
Forever and life the reason I made you my wife is because
You see me for me the real me and love me unconditionally
And even with the circumstances that I had you still gave me a chance
And that's why I live and breathe for you and the kids
And you give me more than what this thing could ever give to me
And now my life is satisfied and complete visions all coming true
Yea of me and you placing rings on each others fingers saying ""I do""
You stuck with me through my thick and my thin to go back and live life over again
Nah this is my destiny it was worth the agony to get the ecstasy.

We can runaway and spend some time
I'll always be the one right by your side
Tell the whole world you belong to me
You are my everything
I want to run away with you
do do do do do do do do

I never ever met a shorty that was quite like you
And even tho it was wrong I fell in love with you
Now we sit here not really knowing what to do
But I'm sure that you know I'll give the world for you
If I could runaway with you I wouldn't even think twice
I promise girl I'll put it all on the line
I know forever seems to be a long time
But that's what I'm seeing when I look into your eyes
And it don't matter what your friends might say
'cause I know deep inside you feel the same way
You could tell me what you want but I could read your mind
So quit lying to yourself and put hand mine
I get excited everytime you come close
And being right here with you is what I love the most
So any time your feeling lonely inside
We could runaway together and leave this world behind

We can runaway and spend some time
I'll always be the one right by your side
Tell the whole world you belong to me
You are my everything
I want to run away with you
do do do do do do do do

Waking up in the morning and your still not there
Can't we runaway and escape somewhere
Missing your soft touch your lips next to mine
Holdin up your hands as you look in my eyes
What must of happened to the love we both felt inside
Emotions were strong and the feeling was right
Now we don't speak anymore you went your own way
And that's what loves about then I was meant left
Go ahead and take your time if that's what you need
My loves for you forever my heart for you bleeds
Things happen for a reason so I ask my self should I be strong
And wait or move on to some one else
I know you still love me I could feel it inside
You always kept it real no games no lies
If your ever feelin lonely feel the need to get away
Call me up I'll be there together we'll run away girl

We can runaway and spend some time

That I'll always love you baby

Sometime I think about 
Everything that we've been through 
And I pray that you would just open your eyes 
I love you I need you 
So please don't throw our love away 

Since the day you and I snuck away to be alone
I knew from that night something special went on
It must have been the first kiss 
You told me that no one else in the world made you feel this 

I felt the same way too but nothing stays the same
I'm sorry for the tears I'm sorry for the pain 
You were the one that always made things right 
I promise you this though you got a friend for life

Maybe one day we can try it again 
And maybe things can be a little different 
So lets just kiss and say goodbye 
'Cause I really can't stand the pain of seeing you cry

I've given everything 
I loved you endlessly 
But when it comes to me 
You don't even notice me 

I've given everything 
I loved you endlessly 
But when it comes to me 
You don't even notice me

All that's mine is yours that's what I said 
Treat you with love and respect in everyway 
You wanted I gave you need me I was there 
Now you treat like if I'm not here 

I love you and I need you don't want to let go 
If you want somebody else please let me know 
Can't take it no more I feel in dying inside 
Is this the price I pay for handing you my life? 

I know I'm not prefect but I truly cared 
So when you wake up one morning and I'm not there 
Just remember I loved you it will never be the same 
Gave you everything and you threw it all away

I've given everything

My heart and my soul, 
My trust my money my time, 
What more can you ask from a man 

Even when times are hard 
I held out my arms and held you 
Even excepted you though whatever weather
But now I feel it we're at the end of the rope 

Whatever we had now I gotta let go 
Nights like this I wish raindrops would fall 
To cover my tears 
Wishing I could replace all those wasted years 

Of loving someone who couldn't love me back
And now again I gotta start from scratch 
But I know I've given you my everything 

I've given everything 
I loved you endlessly 
But when it comes to me 
You don't even notice me 

I've given everything 
I loved you endlessly

Grabbed her hand and she hugged me, acting kinda shy.
Dimples on your face got you looking pretty fly.
Baby this is real talk I wanna be with you.
Little did I know, you were digging me too.
Now I'm down on my knees got you saying I do.
So I had to write a song dedicated to you.

Something about you baby
Drives me crazy
Something about this pretty girl
Blows my mind,
Something about you baby
Drives me crazy
Something about this pretty girl
Blows my mind",Pretty Girl

I want to be your sunshine

I want to drive you crazy
I gotta be right there
Whenever you call on me
I want to be your everything
So tell me if your feeling me

Now all my life
I've never felt like this
For some one else
Yeah baby I'm feeling you
The way that you've been feeling me
When no one else in the world even cared for me
You held me close
The way
You told me things would be okay
On my bad days
And most of my good times were cause of you
Knowing we were strong
Cause the things we've been through
Your the one I want to grow old with
To make my memory's to cherish
In hold in the back of my mind
And girl you was like hard to find
In this crazy world of material things
You loved me when I had nothing
It made you worth some thing

[Chorus]

I'm feeling you
Not once
Not twice
But your three times my lady
The comfort of your arms got me feeling like your baby
I'll be there for you
Lets make love into memories
Your tender touch
And you smile
Always get the best of me
Never let you go or treat you bad
Give you all I have
I belong to you
And only you girl
I want you bad
You want to be my sun up
I want to be your light
You want to be my lady
I'm thinking more like my wife
Got me feeling crazy girl
You driving me wild

If you come with me now
Let me be your everything baby
Do all I can

I want to be your man

This is for my muneca
With them pretty brown eyes
Have I ever told you girl
That you always on my mind
And when I finally get to see you
I feel a rush inside
A thousand time a day
Your pretty face runs through my mind
I want to stay with you
Cause it was meant to be
Your like an angel from the heavens
That was sent to me
My precious one
The one that fulfills my needs with happiness
The one that keeps me focused
When I,
I start to stress
I want to thank you baby
For the many things you've done for me
And all the goodness
You always put inside of me
With that pretty face
With that sexy walk
With that lovin' that you given me
When the lights is off

NB Ridaz,"Desde el día que te conocí
Yo sabia que eres un ángel del cielo

Cada vez que estamos juntos
Se me llena el corazon
Eres tu mi alegría
y tu sonrisa es mi sol
Cada vez que estamos juntos
Yo me siento tan feliz
Porque el sol y las estrellas me acercaron a ti

Despertando en la mañana pensando en ti
Tus brazos y besos los quiero sentir
Yo te quiero, y te amo, que haría sin ti?
Un ángel que Dios me enviado a mi
Me ensenaste amar mi razón por vivir
Prometo ser fiel y estaremos feliz
Tu ya sabes que conmigo sola nunca estarás
Mi corazon te pertenece nunca mas lloraras
Eres toda mi vida, mi mujer especial
sonrisa mas bella, días haces brillar
No hay nada en este mundo que no haría por ti
No te olvides yo te quiero, contigo quiero morir

Tu eres toda mi vida
Mi consentido
Ya no quiero estar sin ti

Tu eres toda mi vida
Mi consentido
Ya no quiero estar sin ti

Ya no quiero vivir sin ti a mi lado
Eres el amor que siempre a buscado
Por eso mismo  te mando esta canción
Para decirte que te entrego mi amor
Quiero que sepas todo lo que siento por ti
Si no estas en mis brazos, no soy feliz
Cada minuto, de cada hora, de cada día
Quiero que siempre seas mía
y cuando llegue la noche te voy a amar
Besando tu cuerpo, no quiero parar
Porque eres mi reina princesa de amor
La única, la dueña de mi corazon

Final mi reina a mi lado  te amo y te lo digo
quiero ser tu esposo, tu mejor amigo
la boda mas bella, tenderas tu Castillo
me tienes a tus pies, te entrego este anillo
dime que me amas y estarás conmigo
brindaremos nuestro amor y el futuro contigo
bailaremos en la noche brillaras como una estrella
honesto cuando digo eres tu la mas bella
me abrazas y me besas con tanto cariño
el día que te mire , halle mi destino
juntos para siempre haré todo por ti
yo se que tu me amas y confías en mi",Tu Eres
NB Ridaz,"You know that I been wishin' for you some day I know you're comin' back
I know your comin' back girl someday
Tell me why you went away and left me lonely
NB Ridaz.com

I'm wishin' on a star (I'm wishin' a star)
To follow where you are (to follow where you are)
I'm wishin' on a dream (I'm wishin' on a dream)
To follow all my dreams (to follow all my dreams)
To make you come back to me

If I could take every second, every moment that we spent
Erase it from my life and start over again
I wouldn't do it, I couldn't even try
Cause even if the pain and tears never dry
At least I know I had my days with you
Rememberin' when it was just me and you
I close my eyes and wish it was a dream
That I could wake up and you would be next to me
Did you love me?
Did you lie to me?
Why'd you make a promise that you knew you couldn't keep?
You got me twisted and I'm losin' my grip
If I never met you girl, love wouldn't mean sh...
So I ain't never givin' up on you
I built my whole world and it was all around you
I made a promise and I'm keepin' it true
So I'll never love again if I can't have you

I'm wishin' on a star (I'm wishin' a star)
To follow where you are (to follow where you are)
I'm wishin' on a dream (I'm wishin' on a dream)
To follow all my dreams (to follow all my dreams)
To make you come back to me

If I had a wish, baby it would be this
Take you back to the days when we first kissed
You had never been touched, we loved each other so much
Holding you tight under the moon at night
I was yours, you were mine
Everything was so right
Wish upon a star, most precious of all
Can't imagine being without you
With all we been through
There's nothin' in this world I wouldn't do for you
Now I sit here alone, never knew I could cry
All I have is faithful memories
Wonderin' why you left me cold
Ripped my heart and my soul
Everyday I pray that I can see your smile once more
Come back, love I need you can't take it no more, 
Dyin' inside, life means nothin' no more
Don't want to say goodbye 
But I gotta let you know
If you ever change your mind
My love is all yours 

I'm wishin' on a star
You know I'm wishin' on a star
Tryin' to follow where you are (you are, you are)
(Where are you baby)
You know I'm wishin' on a star (Maybe in another lifetime)
Tryin' to follow where you are
Oh you are, you are, you are  

Now when I had you I loved you
When you had me all you ever did was hurt me
Even when I wanted to let go, I couldn't
My soul wouldn't let me 
Even through the bad times, I smiled
And the good days we shared together
It's hard to enjoy the success without you here
But I maintain
Magic told me this was gonna be best verse
I told him I just wrote it down cause my soul hurt
I'm tired of living a lie
I miss how she hugged and kissed me,
Loved and held me
Never thought my heaven could turn to hell so quickly
You gave me this broken heart,
You're the only one who can fix it
Forget the past, we gotta lot of time to make up for that
And even though we met other people
We have to admit it could never equal the sunshine
And pleasure that we made together

I'm wishin' on a star
You know I'm wishin' on a star
Tryin' to follow where you are (you are, you are)
(Where are you baby)
You know I'm wishin' on a star (Maybe in another lifetime)
Tryin' to follow where you are
Oh you are, you are, you are",Wishin

About is what this thing could be
A future baby
Baby you're one of a kind
That means that you're the only one for me
Only one for me

Baby girl you're so one in a million
You are
Baby you're the best I ever had
Best I ever had
And I'm certain that
There ain't nothing better
No there ain't nothing better than this
Girl you're so one in a million

Ne-Yo,"Gotta change my answering machine, now that I'm alone
'Cause right now it says that ""We can't come to the phone""
And I know it makes no sense, 'cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore

(It's ridiculous)
It's been months and for some reason I just
(Can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this

(Enough is enough)
No more walking round with my head down
I'm so over being blue, crying over you

And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

Gotta fix that calendar I have that's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you, there's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you and your memory
And now every song reminds me of what used to be

That's the reason I'm
So sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone
(Stupid love songs)
Don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
Let it go
Turning off the radio

So done with wishing she was still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

Said I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishing she was still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
Why can't I turn off the radio?

In the time it would take to dial the phone, 
In the time it would take you to realize her greatness, 
She'll be gone, 
She's moved on to someone who takes the time. 
 
Her love wasn't a priority to you, 
You had other things on your mind, 
And now that it's much too (??) 
And so far too late, 
The busy signal all that's left behind,

When you get to fussing (fussing)
Yelling and throwing things
I just wanna eat you up

I'm sorry that seeing you mad is so sexy

Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place
Could it be the lil' way that you storm around
That makes me wanna tear you down

Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
When you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you
When we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you

Baby, don't think I don't take you seriously
But I just can't help the fact that your attitude excites me (so exciting)
And you know ain't nothing better

Mad together and have angry sex (I'll blow you out)

Still may be a couple cuties at my door

And get mad when I tell them
I can't be like that no more

I just don't get down like that

Baby you's a dime
But I just don't get down like

Understand, baby girl, that I'm a totally new man
I don't live to crush as many as I can
No more, I found a girl that changed my whole game plan
She the one (she the one) only one that I'm wanting

And I know girl I know that you really want it bad
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't tempted
All the things we used to do I kinda miss it

Some of your time
She said sorry your not my type

[Chorus]
She blew my mind when she replied
I gotta girlfriend
Girl that's alright I'm not hatin'
Just tryin' to cool wit u cool wit u

Sure that's your lifestyle ain't nuthin' wrong
To be honest girl it kinda turns me on
I ain't even tryna to gash up a happy crib
But you can call me when you need that alternative

Or someone to hold a camera with a steady hand
Don't you even trip 
Girl I'm your man 
Or if you decide to give the male race a second chance
She said sorry but I'm taken

[Chorus: x2]
She blew my mind when she replied
I gotta girlfriend
Girl it's alright I'm not hatin'

42nd street, 4am
I'm rolling slowly no
Destination in mind
Driver looking at me strange cuz I got in (in)

Handed him a lot of cash
Sat back and told him just drive (drive)
I'm thinkin' bout the day
You packed your things and left

Sayin' you knew all about Chanel,
Tiffany, Tracy, Stephanie
You went away,
So I'm writing in the fog upon the window to express myself
And how I'm feelin'

[Chorus]
Y, L, E, N, O, L
As I roll past you in this taxi cab
If you care at all, that means I'm lonely (lone)
Y, L, E, N, O, L
As I roll past you in this taxi cab
If you care at all
That means I'm lonely

I see a woman walking with her man (man)
Man with his woman
Smiling as they stroll into this little bar (Bar)
As they kiss each other holding hands

I get sick to my stomach
So jealous of how f*ing happy they are
Lucky B*stards
There's a couple different people I could call right now

But the one I'm wanting don't want me at all right now
And that hurts
Through my heart, my mind, and my soul (soul)
Rolling in this cab

Writing on the window
Singing Y

[Chorus]

What am I supposed to do now
Rolling round, feeling like a fool now (ha ha hoo)
Cryin like a b*it*h in the back of this taxi cab
So used to it (ha ha hoo)
Driver tries to ask if I'm alright
I say ""Never mind, mind your business and just drive dammit (haha hoo)
You don't know nothing about how I feel right now, let me spell it out""
(Y)

[Chorus]

Y, L, E, N, O, L (What it means baby)
As I roll past you in this taxi cab (Said I'm sorry that I did you wrong)

'Cause right now it says that ""We can't come to the phone""
And I know it makes no sense, 'cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore

(It's ridiculous)
It's been months and for some reason I just
(Can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this

(Enough is enough)
No more walking round with my head down
I'm so over being blue, crying over you

And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

Gotta fix that calendar I have that's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you, there's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you and your memory
And now every song reminds me of what used to be

That's the reason I'm
So sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone
(Stupid love songs)
Don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
Let it go
Turning off the radio

'Cause I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishing she was still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

So done with wishing she was still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow

Ne-Yo,"Let me talk to 'em
I guess you know you made it when they start talking 'bout you, right?
Welcome to fame
Y'all don't pay me no mind
I just gotta get some stuff off my chest, listen

Young, energetic, famous, but don't really sweat it
Rich enough, fairly hot; so, basically, sex is not
Difficult to get
That ain't my fault, no, no, listen

And just 'cause I might take advantage once or twice
People tell me I'm not right, thinking that sex was my life
But that just ain't me
So let me clear it up for those who have obviously misread the code
Listen to me now

No, I, am not
I'm not addicted to sex
But, girl, I guarantee that if you lay with me
You just might be
No, I, am not
I'm not addicted to sex
But, girl, I guarantee that if you lay with me
You just might be, yeah

I won't apologize for bein' just a little freaky
I can't help it; it's just in me
But a problem it is not
I'm just fine, y'all
Don't worry 'bout me
Listen
And I won't apologize
For bein' blessed with the ability to satisfy accurately
And quickly find the spot
It's a gift and a curse
Don't mess around
Find my number in your girlfriend's purse

No, I, am not
I'm not addicted to sex
But, girl, I guarantee that if you lay with me
You just might be
No, I, am not
I'm not addicted to sex
But, girl, I guarantee that if you lay with me
You just might be, yeah

I never been shy about myself and sexuality
Never been taboo (never been taboo, but if I)
Have to live without
I know it's something I could do
But I just really don't want to

Just shut up and listen

Two hundred and sixteen
That's how many times that I went
Back and forth about it in my mind
Could she, could she really be
Who he's telling me that she is?
There's something about it
That don't feel right

Said, today she called here twenty-six times
(I know you counted)
You kept telling me not to worry
(Don't worry 'bout it)
Wanna believe that you're telling the truth
(So don't doubt it)
But if you are lying to me...

You're leaving tonight
Out of my life
Everyone said you ain't no good
Then you prove them right
You're leaving tonight
It's over and done
Ain't no sense in trying to wait till the morning comes
(You're leaving tonight)

Baby, now hold up
Let's just settle down
'Cause there's a perfect explanation to this situation
That we're goin' through
(This thing that we're goin' through)
I swear I don't know that girl
But I seen her 'round
And she's expressed how much she want it
But, baby, I'm not on that
All of me is around you, oh

Said, I got a girl like a thousand times
(So you counted)
She kept telling me not to worry
(Don't worry 'bout it)
Please believe I'm telling the truth
(I really doubt it)
Really wish you would believe in me

I'm not leaving tonight
Girl, you're my life
All of your friends think I'm no good
Please, don't prove them right
I'm not leaving tonight
It's over and done
Let's leave this alone, and let's make love
Till the morning come
(Not leaving tonight)

Oh, I won't deny
That everything in my body
Wants to know that you're the one
(So, what's the problem, girl?)
See, I can't take this serious when you're just having fun
(No, I'm not just having fun)
Steady running around, making a fool of me, oh!
(Baby girl, you can't listen to everyone)
(I'm your man) You're my man (Trust in me)
(Don't let them interfere with us being happy)

(Love me, girl)
I love you, that's a fact
(Say that you love me, baby)
But I'll be dammed if I'm a let you up and disrespect who's been there from the start
You not gon' disrespect my heart
You claim to not know not know that, girl
But her name and number is in your phone
She even got a ring tone
You care to explain that part?

Said, today she called here twenty-six times
(I know you counted)
You kept telling me not to worry
(Please, don't worry 'bout it)
Wanna believe that you're telling the truth
(So don't doubt it)
But if you are lying to me...

I'm not leaving tonight (leaving tonight)
Girl, you're my life
(Everyone said you ain't no good
And you prove them right, you're leaving tonight)
I'm not leaving tonight

And let's make love
Till the morning come

Sure, everyone has their problems, oh

How we're living

More than you'll ever know
Other times you get on my nerves (hey)

No, it can't always be
Kisses, hugs, and beautiful words

You was looking for your prince, oh
What you found (what you found)
Is a pauper with potential

Ne-Yo,"(Remix) I love her 'cause she got her own
She don't need mine, she say leave mine alone
There ain't nothing that's more sexy, then a girl
That want but don't need me
Young independent (yea she work hard)
But you can't tell from the way that she walk
She don't slow down, 'cause she ain't got time
To be complaining, shawty goin' shine
She don't expect nothing from no guy
She plays aggressive, but she still shy
But you never know her softer side,
By looking in her eyes
Knowing she can do for herself
Makes me wanna give her my wealth
Only kinda girl I want,
Independent queen,
Workin' for her throne

I love her 'cause she got her own, she got her own
I love her 'cause she got her own

She don't need mine, she say leave mine alone
There ain't nothing that's more sexy,
Then a girl that want but don't need me
Lovely face, nice thick thighs,
Plus she got drive that matches my drive
Sexy thing, she's Ms. Fly
All the while paying her bills on time
She don't look at me like captain save 'em
Gold digging, no she don't do that
Now she look at me like inspiration,
She wanna be complimenting my swag
And everything she got, she work for it,
Good life made for it, she take pride in saying
That she paid for it, only kind of girl I want
Independent queen, working for her throne

[Chorus]

Don't make me laugh boo, never did that bad too,
Make you even have to but even if I had to
Ask my better half to, you'd be more than glad to
When I do that math boo, you always try and add two
I need someone who ride for me
Not someone who ride for free
She say boy I don't just ride
She'll pull up beside of me, I had to ask her
What she doing in that caddy
She say cause you my baby
I'll be stunting like my daddy
And there's not many, who catch my eye
We both wearin' Gucci, she match my fly
And that's why I supposed to keep her closer
Right by my side toaster in the holster
And now she went Loso case you didn't know so
You can save your money dog, shawty getting dough so
What she care what his cost, you can call her miss boss
I got it backwards, Kriss Kross shawty got her own

Now all my ladies that don't need a man for nothing,

Fighting a war I can't win, fighting a memory
Something that used to be,
No matter how hard I fight,
All of my strength and might,
Keeps on defeating me, it just keeps on defeating me.

So what I'm trying to say, I know what's happening,
Your body is here with me,
But your heart and your mind is still with him.

Go back to what you know,
Go back to where you know where your heart is,
Girl, just be honest, this is impossible,
This is impossible, we'll never work cause you don't want it,
Girl, you belong with him so just go back to what you know,
Go back to what you know, because this is impossible.

Telling me things that you two, did when he was with you,
How he was oh so sweet, the way that he used to treat you,
Instead you just can't keep him outta your mind.
Why can't you just tell me that I'm not who you want to be,
Baby you don't want me, no, no, no.

So what I'm trying to say, I know what's happening,
Your body is here with me,
But your heart and your mind is still with him.

Go back to what you know,
Go back to where you know where your heart is,
Girl, just be honest, this is impossible,
This is impossible, we'll never work cause you don't want it,
Girl, you belong with him so just go back to what you know,
Go back to what you know, because this is impossible.

And if that was really what you want,
I will not stand in your way, you want to be free
I will let you be,
I rather you have me, than miserable with me,
Back to what you know,
Back to what you know,
Said back to what you know.

So what I'm trying to say, I know what's happening,
Your body is here with me,
But your heart and your mind is still with him.

At the far end of the aisle
Standing where I should be standing
Some other man on his face there's a smile

I just walked in sat down silent
I stood outside for awhile
Wondering why did I come here
Face it you messed up and now she's with somebody else

And now all I can do is smile
And fade into the background
I'll say congratulations and I'll fade into the background

Such a lovely reception
I sit here sipping Rosé
Then we catch eyes for a second
Both of us smile then quickly look away

It's funny you don't know what you got
Till you ain't got it no more
Put down my glass grab the bottle
I throw it back and I shout she with somebody else

And now all I can do is smile
And fade into the background
I'll say congratulations and I'll fade into the background

Ne-Yo,"So it's over
He's with someone else and you know her
And you just can get any lower
You sit in the dark alone
And won't answer your phone
Well I'm sorry. I want to attend your pity party
I rather go have calamari
And maybe a drink
And yes I think
You should come with me

Life is long
There will be pain but life goes on
With everyday a brand new song
But if you rather stay at home
Let me do you a favor

I'll ask the sun to shine away from you today so you can cry
(If that's what you want)
I'll ask the clouds to bring the rain for you today so you can cry
(If that's what you want alright)
Oh If that's what you want alright

And the pain of a heart from another
Can be difficult to recover

You wanna be down (you wanna be down)
Fine let me help you out

I'll ask the clouds to bring the rain for you today so you can cry

And your tears won't bring him back
I know you wish that it did
But it just don't work like that
Oh I know that healings takes time
Hey even your heart has a pace
Oh but how much time are you gonna take
Hmm too much will be a mistake

I'll ask the sun to shine away from you today so you can cry

I woke up in heaven today
She kissed me I floated away, away
Never felt anything so great
Alright,
Now I brace myself for a fight
Something must go wrong
Cuz it's way to right
I'm light as a feather tonight

Cause I can't feel the ground
Someone let me down
I never felt so high as I do now
It's too good to be true
I don't deserve you
I never felt a love strong enough to
Stop this world from spinning
Stop this world from spinning

And I see,
Heaven when she looks at me
In her smile is the most amazing dream
And in her eyes I fall asleep
And I hope,
Hope that she can see through the smoke
Of my imperfections into my soul
And my heart where she has control (she has control)

Cause I can't feel the ground
Someone let me down
I never felt so high as I do now
It's too good to be true
I don't deserve you
I never felt a love strong enough to
Stop this world from spinning
Stop this world from spinning

Happiness like this can never last (can never last)
Turns into the memories of the past (turns into the memories of the past)
(Going just as fast)

And she begs me all the time to help her
I know that I should but I'm lazy so I don't (yeah)
She's always considering my feelings
Thinkin' of me before herself
Most of the time I'm so damn selfish
I don't even realize she treats me so well

She's so much better than me
I'm so unworthy of her
Oh, Why does she stay
Why does she stay, why

She hates that we don't spend much time
We barely see each other at all
She don't even nag me 'bout always working
She just says I just wish every now and then that you'd call
And I don't know why she?s still here
She could have any man that she wants
I step outside of myself
To see how much she loves me
And all the things that I should do for her that I just don't, just don't
And I realize

Ne-Yo,"We're a hurricane
So destructive in the way that we do
A little bit insane
But she loves it just the same
And me too

They say love and insanity
Are somewhat related
The way that they make us act
But baby girl the love between you and me, oh
Is truly the greatest
Though sometimes we hate it

They can't tell me nothing about no you
You're my
Crazy love
Can't tell me nothing about how we do
'Cause we got
Crazy love, oh yeah

I'm intelligent
I'm not stupid
Not at all, no, no, no
But my common sense
When it comes to you it falls
Then I do something dumb

They say love and insanity
Are somewhat related
In the way that they make us act
But baby girl the love between you and me
Is truly the greatest
Though sometimes we hate it

They can't tell me nothing about no you
You're my
Crazy love
Can't tell me nothing about how we do
You and me got
Crazy love, oh yeah

I walk into where you was at then my phone calls get a who is that
I told her that I worry that we won't last
She told me you need to worry when I don't ask
See that's the crazy love I be talking bout
Gary Coleman face girl what you talking bout
Make me wanna kick you and that yorkie out
Then I see that fat ass when you walking out
How I'm gonna tell my baby bye-bye
Outfit look crazy on her you my lady gaga
But you wanna start it first and get the last word
You wanna lock me down and get the password
Damn I wanna spray don't use juice
So in the bedroom I got a few screws loose
The head's coo-coo back-shots psycho
Hit it from the back hard hope you got Geico

Can't tell me nothing about how we do

We may even very well see hell from the gates
Don't think that you are alright
Are above making mistakes
Said I'm gonna get on your damn nerves
And you're gonna make me mad

'Cause this love is good could never be that bad

[Chorus]
So may you never know the way
Way that it feels
Feels to be lonely
May you never know one day
When love isn't real
See this stuff to me is genuine only

See well maybe in a perfect world
We would get along perfectly
But seeing how this is real life
Sometimes we just wanna be
And I may make you say that you wanna leave
Never come back
But I don't
But I know we can survive all that
'Cause this love is good could never be that bad

So carry on
You don't want it, and I don't need it
Better use for my time, so carry on

Ne-Yo,"Ohh, After this song you gon' love me for my honesty, 
Or you gon hate me for being me yeah Im sayin'
One of the two is gon' happen but all that I can be is what I am and who I am

Chasing women when I should be recording
Invite a couple then I invite some more in
Next thing you know it's 3 in the morning and I've only done one song
20k on champagne in the club, then 20k more just because
That's 40k in three hours but everybody watching my section
So it's alright (Alright), I know it may sound silly to you 
Truthfully it silly to me too, but that's what makes this song so true
(Here's the truth)

I'm a little irresponsible most of the time
I'm a man of my word but only when I ain't lying
I say I'm not a hater but I hate to see you shine
Especially if your shine is outshining mine
I wanna be faithful but I keep running into dimes
And they make it so easy so it's hard to do right
The image I portray you making people judge a book
But if they really took the time to look
Then they would see the cracks in Mr. Perfect (Yeah)
They would see the cracks in Mr. Perfect (Yeah, yeah)
So they would see the cracks in Mr. Perfect (Yeah)
Ooh, they would see the cracks in Mr. Perfect (Yeah)

I ain't got a condom here, oh no (Oh, no)
And too lazy to run to the store (Man it's cold outside)
But you just met her three hours ago, says the angel on my shoulder
But the devil he can talk real loud (Yeah)
And my on decision I'm not proud (No)
But by the grace of God I'm here right now  
Healthy and getting older
So it's alright (Alright eh), I know it may sound reckless to you (Yeah man)
Truthfully it's reckless to me too,(Yeah man)
 but that's what makes this song so true
(Here's the truth)

I'm a little irresponsible most of the time
I'm a man of my word but only when I ain't lying
I say I'm not a hater but I hate to see you shine
Especially if your shine is outshining mine
I wanna be faithful but I keep running into dimes
And they make it so easy so it's hard to do right
The image I portray you making people judge a book
But if they really took the time to look
Then they would see the cracks in Mr. Perfect (Yeah)
They would see the cracks in Mr. Perfect (Yeah, yeah)

Oh ah, I do a lot of stupid shit
Hoping I never have to pay for it
It's like I've become more of an idiot
With every extra million I get
I thank God for my family and my crew 'cause I can be a lot to put up with
Much love to the people that don't mind the cracks in Mr. Perfect, yeah, yeah
(Now let it marinate)

Think about that

oh , they could see the cracks in Mr. Perfect yeah
Ooh you can see the cracks in Mr. Perfect yeah yeah  
You could see the cracks in Mr. Perfect uhh
Said you could see the cracks in Mr. Perfect yeah yeah
yea yeah yea

And in the end they all learned a valuable lesson
Perfection, it's just glorified opinion
When in the grand scheme of things 
It's our imperfections that truly make us perfect
So do yourself a favour, find the beauty in your cracks

What I told myself I would not do, oh
It's 4:15 AM I'm sittin' here drinkin', reminiscing on you, oh
And how I used to let you smoke even though I don't
You get blowed then we both get low

In the back of my mind one million times

It should be you, should be you
Should be you and me right now

Feeling dreams from all these private planes I'm catchin'
Willing to trade all the flashy chains I'm flashin' for a night
Back up for us, exchangin' pain and passion, (Let's go)
Romances, kinda like the Phantom doors you used to ride
'Cause it's tryin' to open up, it's like suicide
God teaches lessons every day,
You was all I needed like Meth' and Mary J
The sun don't shine forever
Any time that we fall that just means we just climb together
Guess we avoided what we could've went through
That don't change the fact (Girl it should be you) that it should've been you

Congratulations
Kinda sucks that we can't be what we were
But congratulations, baby I won't hate
I'm glad you found a man that treats you like you deserved

Single and happy, that's where I'm at
And she wasn't ever approving of that
She wanted me to give her more
But I told her though, ain't long ago
A relationship, I wasn't lookin' for
In and out of town and always on the road
But when I hit that city I called her though
And that's wrong, so wrong
She waited for me to come around so long, so long
And now that wifey material is wifey material
And if you ain't ready, the wife gotta let it go
I wasn't, he was though

Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy

Dance before me like a million eyes,

Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Ne-Yo,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Religious/Ratchet wit Yo Friends (Interlude)

I said, ""Yes it does, yup""
She said, ""Nigga you just wish I was""
I said, ""Why you frontin'?
Just embrace who you really are
And you just might enjoy, a threesome""

You never know. Got to open up your mind. You only live once, know what I'm talkin' 'bout? Nah but for real though, you never thought about it? Never? Aiight

She said, ""What if I said I want to bring in another guy?"" What!?
I just gave her a look like ""you done lost your damn mind""
She said, ""Oh, okay so another girl is fine
But when I mention another dude you're lookin' like you wanna punch me in the eye""
I said, ""Don't tempt me""
She said, ""You know that ain't fair""
I said, ""I'm just playin'
But for real don't no dudes allowed
Only you, me and she in this threesome""
She said, ""Hold up, when did I agree to this threesome""
I said, ""Just now, and you can't take it back, let's have a threesome""
She said, ""Well I did think about my girl Stephanie before in a threesome""
I said, ""I got her number, I'll call her right now for this threesome""

She said ""Wait a minute, you got Stephanie's number
When did you get Stephanie's number?

Ne-Yo,"(I asked you a question)
I feel a rise burning in the back of my head
If she could kill me with a look, I'd already be dead
Excited at the thought of possibly two in my bed
I said some shit that I instantly regretted I said
I hid my deception with absolute discretion
Wanted to turn around and give up an accidental confession
I turned to look at her and she's just standin' there
Facial expression says it all, war has been declared

She said, is there anything you wanna tell me?
I'm standin' there with my head down and I'm thinkin'
Oh no, here we go
What the hell was I thinkin'? Man I wish I was drinkin'
So I could blame it on the liquor, why did I paint the picture?
Why did I think it was something that she would even consider?
Now I'm avoidin' eye contact as if I owe her money
Tryna laugh it off, clearly she don't think it's funny

And then she stepped to me, comin' so steady
Looked at me like she knew already
I betrayed her trust, it weighs heavy
On my head, and then she said
Why can't I be loved?
Why can't I feel love?
Why am I not worthy of
Oh why can't I feel love?

All she wanted was somethin' real, somethin' true
With tears in her eyes she said, ""I believed in you""
I said, ""Please don't leave, please don't go away""
She said, ""You broke my heart, how could I stay?""
It'd be a year before I'd see integrity again

I see him, there he is

Would you still roll over kissin' on me like it ain't?
If I didn't have millions in the bank
I'm talkin' cardboard box and a fish tank
Better yet a fish bowl
And if the fame got old
If the cameras didn't flash when I walk through
If I wasn't makin' them bands when I walk through

You never let 'em bring me down

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,

Years full of tears and regret;
I've been alone broken hearted,
Trying so hard to forget:
 
Girl of my dreams I love you, honest I do,
You are so sweet,
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms,
Then life would be complete;
Since you've been gone dear, life don't seem the same,

And after all's said and done, there's only one,
Girl of my dreams, it's you.

Sunshine and joy always nigh;
We live and learn for tomorrow,

Remember back in high school
We were drunk 'most every day

Drink down by the reservoir
Drive through town and drank some more
'Til we took out Miss Young's front porch
In my old Chevrolet

You thought you were a rich boy
In that big house on the hill
Where we drank your daddy's whiskey
And stole your mama's pills

We were young and stupid
In that summer of eighty-four
Come fall, I left with half my mind
For college up in Baltimore

Albert, we don't have to talk about it now
Tonight we're just two boys from Creagerstown
Come this time tomorrow you will lay your burdens down

State's attorney has a witness and overwhelming evidence
And I just stood there staring, you know I could not put it down
Right there on the front page was a boy from my home town

Albert, we don't have to talk about it now
Tonight we're just two boys from Creagerstown
Come this time tomorrow you will lay your burdens down
Tonight we're just two boys from Creagerstown

I guess some things are not for us to understand
Wish you could break those chains
So I could shake your hand

Albert, we don't have to talk about it now
Tonight we're just two boys from Creagerstown
Come this time tomorrow you will lay your burdens down
Tonight we're just two boys from Creagerstown

Neal Coty,"What we have here is a misunderstanding
A lack of communication, what we have here is
Two people talking and nobody listening
Screaming and yelling things hard to take back

There's worse things than dying
When you've lost your reason for living
There's no point in fighting
When reasons for staying are missing

I'm leaving
There's something out there that I'm needing
There's more to life, there's got to be more to life
Than breathin'

There are still echoes of you and me laughing
Bouncing off walls of canyons in my mind
Stirring up memories of love long forgotten
How'd we let go of something like that

There's worse things than dying
When you've lost your reason for living
There's no point in fighting
When reasons for staying are missing

I'm leaving
There's something out there that I need
There's more to life, there's got to be more to life

I'm leaving
There's something out there that I'm needing
There's more to life, there's got to be more to life

Neal Coty,"I've been around for some time now
And I really don't care what some people think about me
I've been called a lot of things some good, some bad
I've had many people doubt me

I'm not ashamed of anything when it comes to this
I stay true to the game
And when the flames were burning slow
I grabbed the torch and let everybody know

What the music, the scene means to me
With pride and sincerity
Handed down by our brothers
Is this our legacy?

I've been around the world and back again
I've had the privilege of watching this grow
Transcend beyond the streets, the clubs, the trends
Beyond anything we had imagined

That's what the music, the scene means to me
Pride and integrity
Handed down by our brothers
Is this our legacy?

Legacy
This is our legacy

It's an honor for us, for me
To stand side by side with those who paved the way for me
It's an honor for us to see so many showing respect
Even those who doubted me and it's only the beginning

That's what the music, the scene means to me
Pride and integrity
Handed down by our brothers
This is our legacy

Neal Davis,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Neal Ely,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Every time I see you pass
In my homeroom class, makes my heart beat fast
I've tried to page you twice
But I see you roll your eyes
Wish I could make it real

I hear your friends talk about me
So why you tryin' to do without me

With the strawberry blond,
And the band played on.

shake with alarm
He'd ne'er leave the girl
With the strawberry curl,
And the band played on.

Neal Hefti,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When
Neal Hefti & His Orchestra,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

Who know where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way
All the way",All the Way
Neal Hefti & His Orchestra,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might As Well Be Spring
Neal Hefti & His Orchestra,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,
Cheerio and toodle-oo
Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks For the Memory

A chill in the air
It's there in your touch
And your icy stare

To make your heart burn
If I built you a fire
Would you fan the flames?
Could I make it burn higher
If I whispered your name?

If I built you a fire
Would you love me tonight?

There's a coyote on the hill
Howlin' at the diamond sky, but no one hears
There are no answers in the stars
Only questions in my heart
So I count mountains on the moon
Through my lonely tears
Countin' mountains on the moon
Sleep, it never comes too soon
I'd climb the highest one for you
Countin' mountains, mountains on the moon
Sometimes in perfect light
Those mountain tops come into sight
Almost close enough to touch
Like dreams of you
And if you pass this canyon dear
I left an echo for you there

I used to run for cover when it came
But since I let it strike me
I never looked at lightening quite the same

Give my love and I a reason to stay in and play

A single mother working hard to raise her baby right

He's talkin' now, he's at that age, the 'Ask a million question' stage
And he expects an answer when he asks about life

Like, ""Mommy, can you tell me what makes airplanes fly and
Why do flowers need the rain to grow?""

There's only one thing she can't answer no matter how she tries
""Where do daddies go? Where do daddies go?""

She's halfway through his favorite book when he falls fast asleep
She reads the ending anyways and kisses him and leaves

She's knows she's got an uphill climb
There's things he'll want to know in time
And she prays that God will give her all the answers she needs

Like, ""Mommy could you teach me how to throw a ball
And would you show me how to use my fishin' pole""

There's a lot of things I need to know, but most of all

And it scared them both to finally go that far
All night long they talked about forever
And they couldn't hide the feelings in their hearts

He said, ""I don't wanna spend tonight alone""
But it's late and I really should get home

And he stood beside the bed with his new family
And brushed away a pain drop from her eye

And he said, ""Close your eyes and try to get some sleep""

And she said, ""Please, please don't leave me now
Oh, please, please don't leave me now
I need a little strength from you, God, you look so proud

Then he brought the baby close so she could see her

Is when she slides up close and talks that twang

She says, give me some sugar when she wants a kiss
That country bent accent is hard to resist
She gets my motor running when she says
How about we drive out in the country and go to town

She's sure got her own way of putting things

Later in her drive way, all alone
I ask her for one more kiss goodnight

Shining through the mist
Cause after all a kiss is just a kiss or so I thought
But I must have been wrong

It could have the music
Cause it sounded so sweet

Off my feet

All night long, it sure was strong
Before  I knew what was going on
I was going, going, gone

I suppose it could have been the perfume
From a honeysuckle vine
Something sure was driving me 
Out of my mind

But I should have known all alone 
It was your love and it was strong
And now I'm goin', going, gone

It might have been the magic 
Written in the stars
Some gypsy might have read it
Somewhere in the cards

Cause whatever it was
It led me straight to your arms

If it hadn't been so good

I called up my folks
And told 'em we were through
And I was well along my way
To gettin' over you
I didn't have to say much
'Cause I knew they understood
Yes, it wouldn't be so bad
If it hadn't been so good

All our old friends
They ask how you are
I tell 'em I don't know
And I don't care anymore
But I can't make them believe
No matter how I try
I've gotta learn to forget you
Or learn how to lie

Well, it isn't like love
Never hurt me before
But I always recovered
And came back for more
This time I'm wonderin'
If I even should

Lord, it wouldn't be so bad
If it hadn't been so good
We seemed so perfect from where I stood
And it wouldn't be so bad

Neal McCoy,"The moment you came home the other night
I could tell that something wasn't right
I ask you what the silence is about
Then all I did was listen while you poured your heart out

And then your eyes looked into mine
And we saw forever was right there all the time
When I held you in my arms it said all there was to say
It should've happened that way, it should've happened that way

Woke up again this morning way too soon
Wish I was fast asleep and still with you
I'd give anything if I could feel how I did when I was dreaming
I could've sworn that it was real

And when your eyes looked into mine
And we saw forever was right there all the time
When I held you in my arms it said all there was to say
It should've happened that way, it should've happened that way

All I really want it back
Words
Words that I said in a heated moment
Still can't believe that I said I wanted out
After all the times that I spent wishing
I'd just shut my trap
You'd think that I could find those precious few words
That'll bring you back

Nothing gonna come of that
Everything I need is behind me lately
Don't you know it's fading fast, fast

My every dream was to just grow up and go
Like a siren song, those bright lights called my name
So I turned that country road into memory lane

Well, I hit that fast lane; it was paved with gold
But it wasn't long till my highbrow ways got old
I started missing things that I thought I'd left behind
Till I found two swinging doors 'neath the neon sign

They were whirling and a twirling to the fiddles and a steel guitar
Them city folk was drinking from Mason jars
I think I found what paradise might be
The city put the country back in me

When you leave the farm, you don't have to leave your room
Just go on home and slip on them cowboy boots

Thought maybe I could clear my mind and see the leaves turn red
Tunes up and the window down
On the skyline drive when she flagged me over
?Hallelujah what a beautiful morning?
Were the first words that she said
Her eyes were blue as the sky on a perfect blue ridge day
She said, ?I could use a lift if you're going my way?, and

I was, I was headed south, I was headed out
Headed nowhere or anywhere we wanted to go
The road stretched out in front of us
And she was ready to run it just like I was

Told me she was twenty-two
And she'd just broken out of William and Mary
Another summer under Daddy's roof that was all that she could do
Her boyfriend, she cut him loose
Too cold for a wedding in January
She said, ?That's enough about me now tell me about you?
I rambled on about broken hearts and staying too long
She said, ?I'm sorry, but you were right to move on?, and 

I was, I was headed south, I was headed out
Headed nowhere or anywhere we wanted to go
The road stretched out in front of us
And she was ready to run it just like I was

Ain't it funny how everything hinges on a twist of fate
She held my hand and said aren't you amazed and

Now can you play me some real cool tunes
Something that sounds like a long time ago
The kind of music that thrills my soul

The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off his back
The monkey grabbed his neck and said, ""Now, listen, Jack
Straighten up and fly right, straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top
Ain't no use in divin'. What's the use of jivin'?
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top""
The buzzard told the monkey, ""You're choking me
Release your hold and I'll set you free""

Neal McCoy,"What started out as small talk
On a bus stop bench before work
Turned into the greatest love story
I've ever heard
She said D's not the kind to send roses
Can't afford diamonds and pearls
When it comes to lifting my spirits
He's the strongest man in the world

[Chorus]
She said he stops my tears before they start
He can be so tender and still be tough
With his crocked smile melt my heart
Fill an empty room with love if anybody can
Cause he's the strongest man in the world

She said he's always leaving love notes
On the refrigerator door
And I leave him surprises in his lunch box
To even up the score
I was thinking what I'd give to be with
Such a wonderful girl
But I know I couldn't compete with
The strongest man in the world

[Chorus]

Then she pulled out his picture
That's when I realized 
The strongest man in the world
Was only five",The Strongest Man in the World
Neal McCoy,"Friend, I can't believe you called me over here tonight
Thinkin' I might recognize that girl out on the floor.
I must admit she looks just like someone I used to know.
That was so long ago, thanks for your concern,
But that's not her.

'Cause she'd be dancin' in my arms, starin' into my eyes,
Holdin' me close the way that she's holdin' him.
Talkin' 'bout forever like we were still together;
Sayin' I love you over, and over, again.
She looks like an angel for sure, but that's not her.

If that was really her, you know,
Then nothing would have changed.
She'd still be in love with me like I'm in love with her.

Neal McCoy,"I used to leave work at 5 p.m.
Get home about a half past three
Spending my time out on the town
'Cause there was nothing waiting home for me

I was prone to doubt but you showed me all about
A brand new philosophy
For my life has changed and I'm sure rearranged
You've made me everything I wanna be

I love her, 24-7-365
Ah, she makes me happy, every minute I'm alive
I don't need Dr. Ruth to figure out the truth
This feeling just can't be denied
I love her, 24-7-365

I'm gonna quit watching my TV
Gonna throw my golf clubs away
No more shooting pool, acting a fool
And party 'til the break of day

'Cause she's the only thing in the whole wide world
That ever made me feel this fine
Oh, and anything that takes me away from her
Is nothing but a waste of my time

I love her, 24-7-365
Ah, she makes me happy, every minute I'm alive
Every second each day til' I'm old a gray
This fascination will survive
I love her, 24-7-365

Ah, it's my life at stake
And it's time for me to make
A change is long overdue
I don't need no resume, I threw it all away
I'm gonna do what I was born to do

I love her, 24-7-365
Ah, she makes me happy, every minute I'm alive
Oh, I don't need no pay, I just wanna say
I bless the day she arrived

Trying to get her on the line

Wanted one more dime

And so I called connect
And crossed my fingers, praying she was in
But when she found out
It was me on the other end

I heard, click, disconnected

This is worse than I expected

That storm last night tore down all the lines
That ran between her little heart and mine
It went click, disconnected

Operator, do you think we can give it one more try
I'm not sure the first time we got the number right
And this time when you tell her my name, would you tell her I'm sorry too

An' her hair was brown an' her eyes were bluer than blue

An' searched for the words to break it to his wife
An' she cried an' said, ""I knew this day would come""

Sometimes I'm tired and just drop the ball
When the earth beneath my feet's just shaky ground
An' when I'm scared I'm gonna let the whole world down

You breathe life into me, put me back on my feet
Every time, you know exactly what I need
An' when I lose control you take the wheel an' no one knows
Quietly you rescue me behind the scenes an' let me be the hero

Some people think I'm strong an' calm an' in control
Like I'm the one who stands his ground when the thunder rolls
If they knew my secret, if they only knew the truth
I would've run a thousand times if it hadn't been for you

You breathe life into me, put me back on my feet
Every time, you know exactly what I need
An' when I lose control you take the wheel an' no one knows
Quietly you rescue me behind the scenes an' let me be the hero

When I'm down on my knees
Prayin' to heaven for some peace
I'm always saved by the angel that God sent to me
Right here next to me

An' you breathe life into me, put me back on my feet
Every time, you know exactly what I need
An' when I lose control you take the wheel an' no one knows
Quietly you rescue me behind the scenes an' let me be the hero
Yeah, you let me be the hero, oh yeah

Neal McCoy,"I was born dirt poor on a dead end country road
My every dream was to just grow up and go
Like a siren song those bright lights called my name
So I turned that country road into memory lane

Well I hit that fast lane it was paved with gold
But it wasn't long till my highbrow ways got old
I started missing things that I thought I'd left behind
Till I found two swinging doors 'neath the neon sign

[Chorus]
They were whirling and a twirling to the fiddles and a steel guitar
Them city folk was drinking from Mason jars
I think I found what paradise might be
The city put the country back in me

When you leave the farm you don't have to leave your room
Just go on home and slip on them cowboy boots
Now it's the best of both worlds all I'll ever need
The city put the country back in me

[Chorus]

Yeah the city put the country back in me",The City That Put the Country Back in Me
Neal McCoy,"My name's Tommy Franks, an' my Daddy's name was Ray.
Ray was a farm boy, a cowboy an' a banker.
A clerk, a roughneck, a driller,
A long-haul driver, a soldier an' a mechanic.
He was also a friend to everybody he ever met.
Ray taught me the value of Faith an' family,
The American flag, hard work, honesty an' a good dog.
I hope my Daddy Ray wasn't the last of a dyin' breed.

He's a cold beer drinker, a buck n' bear hunter:
The best friend a dog ever had.
A post-hole-digger, a man Skoal dipper,
John Deere cap-sportin' man.
With a house on a hill and a pond in the field,
Surrounded by a mess of corn rows.
Makes a livin' from his labour, a credit to the Maker,
He's somebody everybody knows.

[Chorus]
Last of a dying breed who tend the fields and mend the fences.
Heaven knows, I'd hate to think that generation might be ending,
But if he goes, he will go down in history
As the last, the last of the dying breed

Overall wearers, farmer tan tearers,
Down at the BFW hall. (Hot dog.)
Cake pan lickers, ripe tomato pickers,
Hay balers loadin' trailers in the Fall.
Fruit stand sellers, town square dwellers,
Who gather at The Dairy Queen at dawn.
Everybody knows him an' everybody loves him:
God, I'm gonna miss him if they're gone.

Who just came out to mow his lawn.

Rows of houses that are all the same,
And no one seems to care.

Because her roses are in bloom,
And Mr. Green, he's so serene,
He's got a TV in every room.

Here in Status Symbol Land,
Mothers complain about how hard life is,
And the kids just don't understand.

And make it hard for me to see.

Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Shines around me like a million suns,

And life was just a game for today

To feel the loss I can admit

If I can be strong
If you hear my song
You?ll know that it was wrong to say good-bye

Breathing the frozen air, reminding me that the dark season is near
The mystic landscape makes me stop, take a walk through shadow fields
Three crows pass me by and in awe I remember their names and I call out
To the queens of war:

Nemain, Morrigan, Babh Catha
Three crows fly
Like ghosts from another time
Above me in the sky

In the shape of the blackest birds they once ruled the battlefields
Screaming for courage, screaming for vengeance, reaping the souls of the fallen
And all enemies would flee in fear at the sight of the grim war sisters
Oh mighty goddesses, I draw my sword, with you by my side I won't fight my battles alone

And it feeds my own visual world

Through the dark she creeps
She's been called back to life
Yet unknown, yet unseen
A shadow in their minds

She says ‘reverse… strike back'!

She's been known by many names
Before they banished her kind
Bound her for all centuries.
Erased her from their minds

Was it me that called her back to life?
Summoned her so many times
Too many absent years
Despair beyond repair

She's knocking at their doors
She whispers into their ear
Get up from the floor
Remember me, I am your voice

I am your defence
I will help you to strike
The darkest goddess of revenge
I will show you how to fight

Through dark streets and corridors
Frightened vessels, broken pride
She gathers more and more
She leaves a knife by their side

So they cut the fists that cause the pain
And she smiles satisfied
Her image burned in their minds
The memory of womankind

Remember her bittersweet words

But the bagheads down by Central Station are closer to where home is
It can be grim and send you West from time to time
Yeah, this place is such a shipwreck
But this shipwreck, it is mine

Day by day we grew to love this place
And where I make my grave, my anchor lays

I've been wasting away
But in a town with no way out, there's not much else to do anyway
If you're looking for a place to decay
Then there will always be a place in my town called revelry

I've seen a punch or two
Narrowly escaped a few
And if you can get the day off, I could show you a view
I remember the football games
The first time that I got laid
And the time J broke his finger drinking by the lake

Day by day we grew to love this place
And where I make my grave is where my anchor lays
The sound of my youth echoes out through these empty streets
I guess I can't kick up the roots
It's home, and that's the truth

I keep straining my ears to hear a sound
Maybe someone is digging underground
Or have they...

Yo man motherfuckers are clowns man; Hip-hop's too nice
It's too pretty
What are you gonna do to it Necro?
Take a razor, and slice it!

[Necro]
Yo, peep this shit like this
Kill the head, kill the body, and knows who I'ma ruin
When I float like a dead body and sting like peroxide on wounds
I'm rollin a fatty like death is comin believe it
Recognize the chain of command I deliver the pain you're receivin
Brain washing has officially begun
Kid you peep a psycho holdin a butcher knife dancin like Re-Run
It's rainin, as God pisses on earth
I drop bile like a vagina dismisses at birth
Devour my shower that's golden
I'm puffing the sacks, rolled in
smoldered flesh, holding the fresh, cancer-infested colon
How can I make my point to you fools?
I'll drop a dead A&R off a roof
and on his chest it'll say, ""Necro rules!""
I'm above the constitution
My shit stays bubblin like burnt flesh
My rhymes are acid in Clorox solution
Your eyes will burn once the acid hits
You'll be blinded like Rosie O'Donnell
jumped up ten feet in the air and flashed her tits
Life is shady G in 1976 my parents created me
I've been flippin since 1983
I always took pain as a game
When I was six I cracked my head open
and looked in the mirror to see my brain
Wonder why I'm like an icicle?
At five I was hit by a car ridin my tricycle, a hit and run son
Mad young in the hospital receivin stitches made me vicious
Peeping cretons with Mephisto in their eyes made me suspicious
Runnin through Glenwood PJ's, as a young buck
I didn't dance that fresh, I burnt ants to death
Taste me you will see more is all you need
Dedicated to how I'm killin you!
You're unhealthy you're a felon P.O. checks your bladder
You're an addict; if you beat me I'll deliver you death on a platter
The customer's always right but this time the customer's left
on a stretcher gaspin for breath
The cipher flows like rolly polly, kill yourself slowly
Plus you're already dead if you're homely
So bitch, there's a little red dot on your skull, so pray
Most of New York's population is filled with mental patients
pretendin to be normal, pretendin to be mental patients
Gotthem got rapists by the pile
Watch out for goons of vile infested smiles
and dreams of molestin your child
You gotta pack a black, glock, with, the,
extra clip when shit gets thick
You gotta punch a kid, dead, in the, nose, 
if he ever tries to front and diss
You need to puff a bag, of, dro's, when,
listening to brutal shit like this
You gotta rock a lamb, skin, with, the, 
spermicide for a nasty bitch
Make sure your girl's syphillis clean
before I slide my tongue up in her
Don't you darrrrrre ruin my dinner!
My ventriloquism hits you like ism
Sprayed with raid mixed with pissim mixed blades butchery sadism
I rip your gat, when I twist my wrists
1 finger, 2 finger, 3 fingers, 4 fingers fuck it the whole fifth
Ran up your wife's ass gets murdered type fast
Blast scum up on your BC mask and dirty flash pipes flash
Call, plumbing we're coming inside like sluts like Kimberly Drummond
You know the steez, I slay my prey, day by day
Kill yourself, on some euthanasia shit
Rockin Timb's with razors on the tip
Today's the day to flip on a decapitation tip
I'm fascinated with, leavin you lacerated split
on point like an assassination hit your knot
Some one to have patience with, I'm better off lettin off
two clips at you face set it off to decide who's better off deaded off
Inject 'til you feel correct, feel the effects of my hex
Force you to have sex with techs, chopped at funeral next
Buy my poison I got triple six in my beeper
I talk to myself cause giving my own self therapy's cheaper
The violence hits you like a spliff filled with some holy pot
Penetrate your skull like an obituary riff from ""Slowly We Rot""
You'll soon be fractions and numerator
of a denominator when I play dominator
When you're dead your brain's enbalmed with data
Peepin Vietnam through Vader, futuristic butcher CD-ROM cremator
Your - spine cracks in 3-D like Imax
You won't be Superman no more feel the pain climax
No anesthesia, even if the doctor takes some codine and combines crack
that's fine packed and mixed with phenobarbital liquid
and a Raid sprayed dime sack, nuttin numbs your future sums
I threw you in a wheel chair you're a crumb
A pebble, a worm, a snail
I'll be a mental patient with a red afro on thorazine when you inhale
Uhhhhh, uhhhhhhm uhhhhhh, another blunt filled with dust
And another blunt filled, and another blunt filled
And another blunt filled with dust
Last week someone tried to put me in a coffin
That's the second time a nigga tried to kill me
I'm starting to feel important
For some cats smilin ain't their style
But there's something so evil about seeing a murderous smile it's vile
Gore is a tattoo on your mind, suicide's a laxative
It'll eat you up inside like you swallowed maggots by accident
I main..line to main-tain
I'm fightin the biggest fight of my life
You gotta pack a black, glock, with, the,
extra clip when shit gets thick
You gotta punch a kid, dead, in the, nose, 
if he ever tries to front and diss
You need to puff a bag, of, dro's, when,

Guns will point at blank range I'm pointin pistols for brains
Put you splattered like paint your whole anatomy faints
Stuffed like Latter Day Saints that don't know how to be quaint
It's assault robbery or a battery rape
Peep the tragedy shake and the pin dropping silence
You shot with the 9 inch for stoppin the violence
Do you a slight favor before you're mortified
Cut you with the light saber and wound your quarter eyes
Ain't nowhere to hide from my gruesome legacy
It's hard to flea while you bleed cause you're losing energy
Foul like sexual harassin blast you with the mack 10

Drill saws and tools fill the gore slaughter you
Drown you in a water pool now your breath bubbles rise

Forgive me just one of my lies

Never never cause my love goes

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet

On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,

I've been getting in the way
Well, I held back not to freak out

It's the only thing that keeps me there
It's just typical of me and typical of her

It's no surprise, we're in and out of grace
We're all mean and we all fight

The only thing that keeps us down
It's the only thing that makes us sound

We've all been warned but we still chose to stay

I can't believe it now the time has come

In the light of the morning
Can we change what we felt and heard
Can we turn it into the glory
Break the paths of our fathers before us
Though we stand on the outside
We will find what we once believed
And will crawl our way to the clear skies
Standing up we are
Standing up we are

We roll the dice we play like fools
We plead with time to change the tules
It's like a hurricane is coming our way
We've all been warned but we still chose to stay

I can't believe it now the time has come",Hurricane
Needtobreathe,"Come down to the river
Come and let yourself in
Make good on a promise
To never hurt again
If you're lost and lonely
Broken down
Bring all of your troubles
Come lay 'em down

All you sinners 
And the weak at heart
All the helpless
On the boulevards
Wherever you are now
Whatever evil you've found
Bring all of your troubles
Come lay 'em down

We're all tied to the same old failings
Finding shelter in things we know
We're all dirty like corrupted small towns
We'll bring our troubles
Bring our troubles
And lay 'em down

All you rich men
And the high above
All of those with
And without love
All you burdened
And broken down
Bring all of your troubles
Come lay 'em down
Come lay 'em down
Come lay 'em down
Come lay 'em down

(Come lay 'em down) 
Come all you broken
(Come lay 'em down) 
Come all you helpless
(Come lay 'em down) 
Bring all your burdens
(Come lay 'em down) 
Just lay 'em down
(Come lay 'em down) 
Come all you broken
(Come lay 'em down) 
Come all you helpless
(Come lay 'em down) 
Bring all your troubles
(Come lay 'em down) 
Come lay 'em down

Come lay 'em down

Come lay 'em down

Come lay 'em down",Lay 'Em Down
Needtobreathe,"We born to embrace, not accept it
We were given nothing more, and so we kept it
As the colors of our boots keep fading
We live a life that we hate without saying

Who would listen to the cries of a poor man
We've never done nothing
How could we be something
Every heart has an hour of existence
Every breath brings a chance for redemption
If somehow we could wake up

Let us love
Like we were children
Make us feel
Like we're still living
In a world I know that's burning to the ground
Give us time
To beat the system
Make us find
What we've been missing
In a world I know that's burning to the ground

In the crowd of the dead and disappointed
We're ashamed, giving up on what we wanted
Take a chance on a long shot this time
Aren't we all just at least worth another try

I'm a king in the land of abuses
Undetermined by the promise of excuses
Who's to win if we know that it's not fair
Who would fight when it seems that no one cares
If somehow we could wake up

Let us love
Like we were children
Make us feel
Like we're still living
In a world I know that's burning to the ground
Give us time
To beat the system
Make us find
What we've been missing
In a world I know that's burning to the ground

It's hard to stay here but where do we go
I know we can't feel it anymore
It's true that time is wearing us down
We fall further and further away
Waiting for always to change

Let us love
Like we were children
Make us feel
Like we're still living
In a world I know that's burning to the ground

Leave your hurting on the road behind you
Let the wind go with you 'til the morning comes
Yeah, your sorrow, it can't save you
It won't answer for what you've done",Let Us Love
