Prince,"Last night I spent another lonely Christmas
Darling, darling, you should've been there
'Cause all the ones I dream about
You are the one that makes my love shout, you see
You are the only one I care for

Remember the time we swam naked
In your father's pool?
Boy, he was upset that night
But boy, was that ever cool

Remember the night we played Pokeno for money
And you robbed me blind
Remember how you used to scream so loud
'Cause you hated that number nine

Hey, I saw your sister skating on the lake
This afternoon
Good heaven, how she's grown
She swoons the boy skaters she's so tall

But of all your father's children
All your father's children, baby, you know
You are the finest of them all
You are brighter than the northern star and I

Last night I spent another lonely Christmas
Darling, darling, you, you should've been there
You see, of all the ones I dream about
You are the one that makes my love shout
You see, you are the only one I care for, yeah

My momma used to say ""always trust your lover""
Well, now I guess that only applies to her

'Cause baby, you promised me
Baby you promised me you'd never leave
Then you died on the twenty-fifth day of December
Oh, baby

Last night I spent another lonely, lonely Christmas
Darling, baby, you, you should've been there, now
'Cause all the ones I dream about
You are the one that makes my love shout, you see
You are the only one I care for

Your father said it was pneumonia
Your mother said it was strep
But the doctor said you were dead and I
I say it's senseless

Every Christmas night for seven years now
I drink banana daquaris 'til I'm blind
As long as I can hear you smilin' baby
You won't hear my tears
Another lonely Christmas is mine
Yeah, mine
Yeah
Another lonely Christmas is mine

Last night, yeah, I spent another lonely, lonely Christmas
Darling, darling, you should've been there, yeah
'Cause all the ones I dream about
You are the one that makes my love shout, you see
You are the only one I care for

I tried to tell them that I didn't want to sing
But I'd gladly write a song instead
They said okay and everything was cool
Till a camera tried to get in my bed

Hello, my bed, hello, hello

I was sittin' pretty with a beautiful friend (""oh, darling"")
When this man tries to get in the car (""'ey Prince, c'mon, give us a smile, eh?"")
No introduction, ""how you been?""
Just ""up yours, smile, that's right, you're a star!"" (star)

You call 'em bodyguards but I call 'em my friends
I guess I'm used to havin' 'em around

I'm not afraid to die (don't be afraid)

Down on my knees begging you please, please

Why can't you call me sometime baby, yeah

Just one lousy dime, baby

First he crucified every dandelion out in the yard
Then he screamed at baby twice for throwin' rocks at passin' cars
Baby didn't listen, so like a priceless work of art
He got snatched by his Papa who then opened up the closet door
And pushed the four-year-old down, onto the closet floor
Baby cried ""I'm sorry, I won't do it no more""
Papa said ""Yeah, I know, that's what this here's for""

He said ""How come I don't love my woman?""

She didn't have no damn business
I know what you did, how you did it and who you did it with
So you might as well plead guilty

Do you swear to tell the whole truth
Not the half truth like you used to, so help you God?

Place her hands behind her back
So I can tie her up tight and get into the act

Close your eyes
I'm gonna cover your ass with this sheet
And I want you to pump your hips like you used to
And baby, you better stay on the beat)

The same things that you did to me?

About a woman you already know
No prostitute she, but the mayor of your brain
Pussy Control (Are you ready?)

Pussy Control, oh
Pussy Control, oh

Our story begins in a schoolyard
A little girl skipping rope with her friends
A tisket, a tasket, no lunch in her basket
Just school books for the fight she would be in
One day over this hoodie
She got beat for some clothes and her rep
With her chin up, she scolded ""All y'all's molded
When I'm rich, on your neck I will step""
And step she did to the straight A's
Then college, the master degree
She hired the heifers that jumped her
And made everyone of them work for free?
No! Why?
So what if my sisters are triflin'? 
They just don't know
She said ""Mama didn't tell'em what she told me
Girl, you need Pussy Control"" (Are you ready?)

Pussy Control, oh
Pussy Control, oh

Pussy got bank in her pockets
Before she got dick in her drawers
If brother didn't have good and plenty of his own
In love Pussy never did fall
And this fool named Trick wanna stick her
Uh, talkin' more Schick than a Bic
'Bout how he gonna make Pussy a star
If she come and sing a lick on his hit
Pussy said ""Nigga, you crazy if you don't know
Every woman in the world ain't a freak
You can go platinum four times 
Still couldn't make what I make in a week
So push up on somebody wanna hear that
Cause this somebody here don't wanna know

I wanna hip you all to the reason
I'm known as the player of the year
Cause I met this girl named Pussy
At the Club International Balls
She was rollin' four-deep
3 sisters and a weepy-eyed white girl drivin' her haul
I pulled up right beside her
And my electric top went down
I said ""Motherfucker, I know your reputation
And I'm astounded that you're here
I fear you're lonely and you want to know
A twelve o'clock straight up nigga
That don't give a shit that you're Pussy Control
Well I'm that nigga, at least I wanna be
But it's gonna be hard as hell
To keep my mind off a body
That would make every rich man
Want to sell, sell, sell (seventy five, we need another, eighty five, eighty five here, sold!)

You say you want me to love you
But when I try, you won't
Maybe, maybe we should say goodbye

Damned if I do

Tell me the truth, how many you do it to?
I smell vermouth every time I don't get to kiss you
Enough's enough
If you don't want my lovin', then I'll give up, I'll give up

[Chorus]
Damned if I do, damned if I don't
You say you want me to love you
But when I try, you won't
Baby, maybe we should say goodbye

Goodbye

Damned if I don't try to make you see yourself the way I do
Open minded, worldly, always ready for taboo
Tell me what's up, are we gonna go to heaven?
I'll fill your cup, I won't do it like Kevin

[Chorus]

Damned if I do, damned if I don't
Baby, maybe we should say goodbye
Maybe we should say, ""I do""

That's where he whispered her name
He said, ""We can do it here, my dear
But I fear your tears will fall like rain""
They fall like

""Because I must tell you (Tell U)
While I'm deep in your smell
You got the man I want to inflict with pain

Prince,"Let's go down to the holy river
If we drown then we'll be delivered
You can still see the picture upon the wall
One eye staring at nothing at all
The other one trying to focus through all your tears
You can try and try but there's nothing to hide
You can't run from yourself and what's inside
You got to find the answers to the questions that you most fear

So over and over you ask your soul
Why did you come down to a world so cold?
And the voice inside says tonight the truth will be told

You surrounded yourself with all the wrong faces
Spending your time in all the wrong places
Putting your faith in things that only make you cry
People say they love you when they want to help
But how can they when you can't help yourself?
The more they say they love you, the more you just want to die
So here we go again, the self analysis
Have another glass of Port and uh, forget this
The band's playing at the club tonight and they're bound to groove

There you are, you think you're high
You can't ask yourself 'cause you'd only lie
If you had a dollar for every time you tried

You can't call nobody cause they'll tell you straight up
Come and make love when you really hate 'em
Relationships based on the physical are over and done
They're over and done (They're over and done)
You'd rather have fun
With only one, with only one
Only one, one (one)

And then it hit you like a fist on a wall
Who gave you life when there was none at all?
Who gave the sun permission to rise up everyday? (Ooh, oh yes)
Let me tell it (Go on)
If you ask God to love you longer
Every breath you take will make you stronger
Keeping you happy (happy) and proud to call His name (Go on and say it)
Jesus (Jesus)

And over and over you ask your soul
Why did you come down to a world so cold?
And the voice inside said tonight the truth will be told
And this time I was listening, hear me

Let's go down to the holy river
If we drown then we'll be delivered (Yes we will)
If we don't then we'll never see the light (No)
If you die before you try
You'll have to come back and face the light (Oh yes)
When you believe it, you got a good reason to cry (Oh my, my)

So I went on down to the holy river
I called my girl and told her I had something to give her
I asked her to marry me and she said yes, I cried
Oh, that night I drowned in her tears and mine
And.. and instead of a glass of sorrow and wine
Looking back y'all, I don't miss nothing except the time
And when I see that picture upon the wall
The one eye staring at nothing at all
My eyes trying to focus but these are much different tears
Oh, yes they are
Let's go down to the holy river 

Let's go down to the holy river",The Holy River

Mr. Happy, baby doll, I came to do damage (I will take care of you)
Rock your world, knock your brain to another planet 
You know my north pole can generate heat
Been thinkin' about me? Hmm, I can see them stains in your sheets

Before the reputation, they all used to pass me (I will take care of you)

Straight up, the lifestyle of Mr. Happy

Another murder on the news, I can't take no more

I have a child, huh, I have a lot 2 explain
I could write a letter, but who would I send it 2?
It was Sunday night, instead of doing what I usually do I..

I called an old friend of mine just the other day
No congratulations, no respect paid
All she did was wonder if the rumors were true
I said - ""No, I ain't dead yet, but uh.. what about you?""
I can count my friends with a peace sign: 1, 2
It was Sunday night, instead of doing what I usually do I..

I scan my computer looking 4 a site
Somebody 2 talk 2, funny and bright (Oh)

A pill that will make a baby never seek political gain

And as long as I got your attention (Yeah)
There's a couple of new positions that I'd like to mention
Did you ever hear the one about the pinwheel? (No)
That's the one where I put your legs behind your head
And real dirty like, I'ma spin you around
And grab you by the waist and pump you 'til I hear my baby say
""Oww!""
That's what I know you like
I'm your nigga now about to read your rights
And as sure as I'm a nasty boy (What?)

In goes the truth and out goes the lie
And before the beach gets to sandy (Uh oh)
We'll call a wet towel, W.C. is Handy
And it's all nice, comin' one, comin' twice
And if the Johnny's sick, we'll have to take the trip to Electricity

Plug it in if you dare, plug it in if you dare
This motherfucker's so fast, it eats underwear
So there, my little sweet sugar bear
If that ain't enough to make you throw your hands in the air
Then I'm all gone like the horns in this song (Oh oh oh oh!)
Cuz I gots to keep you comin' 'til the early morn'

Maybe I'll want you tomorrow 
The most beautiful girl in the world 
On the deep blue sea 

Perhaps you noticed that I never look you in the eye 
I'm just afraid that I might die of my love for you 
I want to kiss you, but baby, I dare not try 
Or my dreams most surely will come true 
So that's whyÂ¡ 

Please don't hold my hand cause I will 
Damn sure understand and kill 
The other boys in the band who want you tomorrow, tomorrow 

They can't tap it - not tomorrow

You're mine tomorrow 

On a deep blue sea I want to be swept away 
With you I could pass the time of every night and every day (All time) 
Never remembering the songs to sing, let alone what notes to play 
I'm gonna die of my love for you, baby 

Stay with me tonight, my dear 
But please don't hold me tight 'cause I fear 
My heart just might feel joy instead of sorrow tomorrow 

I don't want to be happy - not tomorrow (not tomorrow) 
The most beautiful girl in the world
I'd rather cry tomorrow 

Tomorrow is the day I say after today 
That you and I can play like we want to 
With under garments thrown, the seed can be sown 
Slippery in the sauna 

If I could just look you in the eye

Cause then my dreams will surely come true (All time)

In search of the reason why
In passion and fashion he began travelin' time
Third eye, third eye, third eye

The serpent approves
Then appears between Adam's thighs
And he tries to release upon Eve the nectar
The injector tries
He tries, he tries, he tries

So abduction complete
All stand on their feet
Look at one another and cry

What have we done?
Could this be the fun
On the dotted line for which I did sign?
Oh yeah

I resign from the notion
Cuz yours was the potion
That I'm supposed to die for
I resign

In self-pity so dark
This shitty and stark
Realization is all that will soothe

Ultimately the only one
That can save you is you
Your God is inside and for that God you will do
Whatever it takes
If nothing else is true
The only one that can save you is you, yeah

She was the one who named the group
The original gang of four

Circle Of Amore

Tenth grade Central in September
That was a year I remember
On this chilly cold afternoon
I overheard the gang in the locker room
Rendezvous, Mary's house
Dirty words and wine
Needless to say they all spend the day
Just counting time, counting time
Halfway through her history class
Denise she kindly raised her hand and asked
If she could be excused (""Can I be excused?"") 
Then she ran from school (ran from school) in a hurry,
The other girls, ooh they knew
This is what friends are really for

Four hands in the place where the feet connect

In the vicious race to maturity

Sweat upon the necks of dames

A woman every day should be thanked 
Not disrespected, not raped or spanked 
And if a woman ever said I did 
Uh, she's a motherfuckin' liar and I'm a set-up kid

God bless America, home of the brave 
I'd rather dress to make a woman stare 
I'm puttin' on somethin' that another won't dare 
It's a freezer burn compared to cool 
And if you still got loot, then who's the fool? 
Everybody want to take the stand 
Mind your own motherfucker, let a man be a man 
I can tear shit up y'all 'cause that's my style

I could manage a week or to without those kisses 
It'd be hard, but something tells me I could try

For that matter, whatever to make you reconsider 
Is there truth when you make love to a lie? 
Excuse me, but is this really goodbye? 

Why'd I ever let you in this morning? 
Why'd I let you come inside my door? 
I should have known without that smile adorning 
Your face - a kiss was not what you came for 
That's when your hand reached out to touch me gently 
At least that's how it happened in my mind

Excuse me, but is this really goodbye?

We'd be together forever and for days

Dreams of sovereignty, they tried to come between you and me

Where I was and who I am

The ones who love me without condition, this is my wealth
And with these words I will win

And when you start to fall
You come like a cold winter due in Montreal

Never changing one piece of it

Now there must be a wedding
Now there must be a feast
A feast, a feast
A smorgasbord at least
A brunch, a munch

I see a false picture of myself, another one of you

But I'm willing to do The Work
Willing to do what I gotta do
I'm willing to do The Work
Tell me now- what about you?

Look around and tell me your Sun is risen
When your brothers and sisters are in the Fall
What is left give when our work is done?
What do we own besides the right to crawl?

See we're living in a system that the devil designed
And suffering from this devil's most heinous crime
He's tried to keep us from the reason we were born
That is to be the living truth in human 4m.

But I'm willing to do The Work
Willing to do what I gotta do
I'm willing to do The Work
Tell me now- what about you?

This work is not an easy task
But this is the work we must do for
Revelation to come to pass
This work is the kind that turns your
Back on the Ruling Class
By putting them in their place just like the past

Taste it, ain't it sweet sweet?
Gotta lotta work to do
Taste it, ain't it sweet sweet?
Gotta lotta work to do

Nothing can stop us whatever's in our way
We got to go through it to get to it

Call it, call my name

Heard your voice this morning calling out my name
It had been so long since I heard it
That it didn't sound quite the same, no
But it let me know that my name had never really been spoken before
Before the day I carried you through the Bridle Path door

And ever since that day I haven't wanted anyone but you
And anybody who really knows me knows the truth

I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch
Yeah
If I don't see you real soon baby girl, I might go insane
I know it's only been about three hours but I love it when you call my name, yes I do

Heard a voice on the news saying people want to stop the war (stop the war, hmm!)
If they had a love as sweet as you they'd forget what they were fighting for
What's the matter with the world today?
The land of the free? Somebody lied
They can bug my phone and people 'round my home
They'll only see you and me making love inside

I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you (I just can't wait)
And feel your touch (feel your touch)
If I don't see you real soon baby girl, I might go insane
I know it's only been about three hours but I love it when you call my name

I've never seen the moon look so lovely as the night I saw it with you
It let me know I'd never seen the moon before
(Never seen the moon before)
So many speak of the moon as though it had no flaws
But to compare it to a beauty like yours would give one pause
Nothing about you is false, that's why your love is real
(Talking 'bout real) that's why your love is real
God forbid if you belonged to another, I'd have to steal you (take you from your man)
I might be tempted to break the law (break the law 'round here) 
Because your beauty, it gives one pause (yes, it does)
It slows me down

Just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon baby girl, I might go insane

The meek shall inherit the earth
We wanna be down that way

Then started every single war
That you're people been in?
Who said that water
Is a precious commodity
Then dropped a big old black oil slick
In the deep blue sea?

Who told me, Mr. Man
That working round the clock
Would buy me a big house in the 'hood
With cigarette ads on every block

Who told me Mr. Man
That I got a right to moan?

If I was the man in your life 
I'd make you happy 
I'd treat you right 
I'd buy you flowers every single day 
I'd Give you power 
I'd do whatever you say 

I heard a rumor that you're man he said he'd do you wrong 
And you're so vain you'd think that you're the 1 behind this song 
Sure you know he got plenty lyrics, yeah, up his sleeve 
And after he got what he want he just go up and leave 
And Sunday chocolate on the roof right after his game 
He like the Lakers but the Sixers on when he came 
If he's with another now you best believe the party's cracking 
You're getting played girl, you better get your mack on 
And do onto others as they do onto you 
You call me on the day that you and him are just to through

Was it you that I saw outside the liquor store 
Waiting on that fool to purchase what you'd been dying for? 
And before I see you drop a spill I have to bring you down 
Now you got that chocolate barracuda hangin' round 
Hangin' round your neck like a cheap gold chain 
He don't deserve to say that he ever knew you're name 
Much less he get to smell the perfume I gave you 
Please don't tell me that you all got down 
Better do onto others as they do onto you 
You call me on the day that you and him are just to through

Prince,"Oh, uh, funky

Heard about the party now,
Just east o' Harlem.
Dougie's gonna be there,
But you gotta, call him (call him)

Even the soldiers,
Need a break sometimes.
Listen to the groove y'all,
Let it unwind your mind

No intoxication,
Unless you see what I see.
Dancin' hot 'n' sweaty,
Right in front of me.

Call it what you like,
I'm gonna call it how it be,
This is just another one of God's gifts,
Musicology!

Got to keep that party movin',
Just like I told you.
Kick the old-school joints,
For the true funk soldiers.

Musicology!

Wish I had a dollar,
For every time you say,
""Don't you miss the feeling,
Music gave ya back in the day?""

Let's groove,
September,
Earth, Wind and Fire.
Hot Pants by James,
Sly's gonna take you higher.

Minor keys and drugs,
Don't make a rollerskate jam.
Take your pick, turntable, or a band?

If it ain't Chuck D,
Or Jam Master Jay,
Know what?
They're losin'.
Cause we got a PhD in
Advanced Body Movin'

Keep the party movin',
Just like I told you.
Kick the old-school joints,
For the true funk soldiers.

Musicology!

Hold it down, band.

""Get back! Oh, get back!
Don't you touch my stereo, these is MY records!""
""Don't touch, my records!""

Musicology, musicology!

Everybody get down!
Just like I told you.
Kick the high-school joints,
For the true funk soldiers.

Get goin'!

Keep the party movin',
Keep the party movin',
Uh, don't stop dancin'.

Keep the party movin'.

Keep the party movin',
Just like I told ya,
Kick the old-school joints,

Did we remember to water the plants today?
I forgot to look up at the moon because
I was too busy
I was too busy looking at you, baby

Still it's nice to know
That when are bodies wear out
We can get another
What does that one thing have to do
With the other one?
I don't know
I was just thinking about my Mother

You know what
Turn the stereo back down
Ain't nothing worse than an ole' worn-out love song
Tell me do you like my hair this way?
Remember all the way back in the day

When we would compare whose Afro was the roundest?

Mirror tiles
Above the bed

I don't care who knows it
Cause there's nothing wrong

I'm so scared of losing you
I really don't know what I'd do
Can't bear the thought of another day apart
My heart, my heart, corazon

Once when I first laid eyes on you
I saw heaven and earth anew
Everyone else saw my brown eyes no longer blue

Three one two one

Prince,"Wake up
You're beautiful, loved and blessed
Feel me? (I think I do)

When you found me I was just a piece of clay
I was formless, you gave me a new name
With the breath of life I now live abundantly
All I needed was the potter's hand
And the blood on Calvary (that's right)

But to much power (tell it)
Can can sometimes turn to shame
To much desire
Sometimes makes you feel the same (come on)
But forgiveness is how you win the game
I begged for truth, now I know the truth
And that is when you came and said I was

Beautiful, loved and blessed
I'm better than the day before
Cause you made me confess that I am,
Beautiful, loved and blessed
When you're free you're really free indeed
All you gotta do is just plant the seed

A constant battle to stay ahead of the game
Is anybody famous when everybody wants fame?
Always trying to break you down
Thinkin' that'll raise 'em up
I just wanna be	 happy
Come take this bitter cup from me

If I were ever to write my life story
I could truly say through all the pain and glory
I was just a piece of clay in need of the potter's hand
Cause when you whispered in my ear
The words I so now understand, oh

Beautiful, loved and blessed
I'm better than the day before
Cause you made me confess that I am,
Beautiful, loved and blessed
When you're free you're really free indeed
All you gotta do is just plant the seed

Everything you made you said, ""That's good""
Before the fall of man you said, ""That's good""
Every time I walk in faith, that's good
You let me see another day, that's good
Before the earth was made you said,
""Tamar, I will lead the way and you'll go far""
Knowledge and understanding
Understanding is good
And when I wake up in the morning
All I hear in my hood is people saying that they're

Beautiful, loved and blessed
When you rescue me from the darkness
And our heart just must confess
Beautiful, loved and blessed
When you're free you're free indeed
All you gotta do is just plant the seed

Hey, hey, hey
Wake up it's a new day
Hey, hey, hey
Wave you're hands in the air and say
Hey, hey, hey
Wake up it's a new day
Hey, hey, hey
Wave you're hands in the air and say

Beautiful, loved and blessed
You rescued me from the darkness in the wilderness
But I am beautiful, loved and blessed
No matter what the challenge
I always pass the test

That's what I am, beautiful
That's what I am, beautiful
I don't mean to put nobody down
Still I must confess that I am
Beautiful, that's what I am
That's what I am
When you wanna give up, don't cause you know
You always got a friend

That's what I am, that's what I am

It's like a song, everybody wanna sang
When the music's over, you're ears will ring
With a voice that's saying, ""Queen got no King!""

He got a message saying, you tried to reach him on the phone
He didn't wanna answer 'cause he's so afraid
You'd probably tell him just to leave you alone

You feel left out, but you need to understand
Word on the street, he's still you're man

Now you think you got a good reason to say
Everything that's in you're heart, come what may,
Even though his might get broken

Who's the guilty one when there ain't no judge or jury?
Shadow to the sun, next to the one
Hell ain't got no fury

Will this song have a happy ending?
Will his heart need a-mending?

Only the woman knows, only she knows

I got something you won't know how to handle

You can tell me uh-uh but you know how this man do 
I'ma want it all night long 
I'm glad that we're compatible. mature and grown
Cause this is not something you can do alone 
There's a dance floor but we can use a table
I got to have a partner that's willing and able
Once you try to seduce me it grows and grows

I know you want to take off all you're clothes
But please don't do it 

I got a cool idea my darling;
Let's go outside
I wanna smother you with something shiny as the rims upon my ride
I want to look for the milky way and when I find it 
I'm gonna make you scream my name as if it was divine (Prince)
But we both know that we gotta praise the one who made ya 
Give props to you're mama for the healthy food she must have gave ya 
For the meek at heart these words they might sound like a sinner
But the truth is that you're sitting on every one of you're dinners 
But that's fine cause I'm blind 
About as blind as a cat in the dark
It might come at to in the morning 
After roaming in the park 
Hard to understand always changing plans
Harder then hell to handle 
One scent alone make it worth you're while

Circles of flowers or pyramids of sand 
Violet colored diamonds

Wherever you can
You got to make this woman

My name is Prince, I don't wanna be king
'cause I've seen the top and it's just a dream
Big cars and women and fancy clothes
Will save your face but it won't save your soul
I'm here to tell you that there's a better way
Would our Lord be happy if He came 2 day?
I ain't sayin' I'm better, no better than you
But if you want 2 play with me, you better learn the rules

My name is Prince and I am funky (You can't stop Prince)
My name is Prince the one and only (You can't stop Prince)
I did not come 2 funk around (You can't stop Prince)
'Till I get your daughter I won't leave this town
I won't leave this town
I won't leave this town
I won't leave this - leave this - leave this

The funkier I be
The funkier I get, oh shit
Lickety split on the lyric
A new jack in the pulpit
Watch it deacon, your track is leakin'
What is this you're seekin'?
The syncopated rhymes are at their peak
When you jumped on my D.I.C.K.
That's the one thing that I don't play
The jock strap was 2 big 4 you anyway
You're just a simpleton
I'll bust you like a pimple, son
My star is 2 bright
Boy, I'll sink you like the ship Poseidon Adventure
You're bumpin' dentures 2 be cocksure
There must be more coming from
Your mouth than manure.
So with a flow and a spray, I say hey
You must become a prince before you're king anyway

It's time I get ig-nig-nig-nig-nig-nig-n-ignorant
Def be the beat that I'm rockin'
Yo so, come get a hit
And put your thinking cap on
You've been forewarned
I call upon the inner forces that I've got brewin'
In my cauldron. That means my nugget...
Sometimes I'm rugged
The style I posses be havin'
The other brothers buggin' and this is 4 those who oppose
And propose 2 overexpose disclose
Pose a threat 2 my brother
Like any other man makin' a stand
I'll be damned if I let you play this hand
I'm the blackjack dealer and the cards are stacked
What do you expect 2 win when you're used to playing craps?

(Do that, do that somebody)
Hell yeah, let's get this under the hmm...
(Do that, do that somebody)

""Damn."" It's gettin' tricky
I mean it's a sticky situation
2 resurrect a groove with feeling
And give it this much affection
Passion flows and who knows
What lurks in the gallows of my mind
I put my foot in the ass of Jim Crow
12 inches of non-stop sole
I'm on a roll with P, and it's time for the show
So do that, do that somebody
Wave your hands in the air
This is a motherfucking party
While you're laying back I'm on the attack paddywhack
Give yourself a bone
This is my house and I'm prone
2 layin' some chrome upside some motherfuckers dome
And I'm out...

Together with love for one another

Thought she really rocked the road, yes she did
Kept her tears up in a bottle
Poured them out to save her soul

Planet Earth must now come into balance with the one
That caused it all to be
Then we'll see His kingdom come
So shall it be written, so shall it be sung

Imagine you could rid the Earth
Of anyone you choose
Which ones would you need the most
And which ones would you lose?

Do we want to judge another
Lest we be judged too?
Careful now
The next one might be you

[Chorus]

Imagine sending your first born
Off to fight a war
With no good reason how it started and what they are fighting for
And if they're blessed to make it home
Will they still be poor?

Pray for peace right now and forever more

[Chorus x2]",Planet Earth
Prince,"The main problem with war
Is that nobody ever wins
The next generation grows up
And learns how to do it all over again

No matter who started the argument
Just matters how each one ends
How many people really want resolution?

The main problem with people
Is they never do what they say (They say)
One minute they want peace (Want peace)
Then do everything to make it go away

Dropping bombs on each other
In the act of saving face
Tell me now people how is that resolution?

[Chorus:]
Either you do or you don't
Either you will or you won't
Making amends (Make amends)
Is a difficult pill to swallow

What can we lose if we try?
With no water, a flower dies
With no one to lead resolution will follow

Resolution

Love is like a circle
No beginning and no end
A broken heart will mend
If you love it like your best friend

Handle your heart with care
It's as delicate as a wing
When the storms come again
Pray for resolution

Either you will or you won't (Either you will or you won't)
Either you do or you don't

Will you want resolution? (Either you do or you don't)
Come on everybody
All over the world
All over the world 
Tell me
How many people really want resolution?",Resolution
Prince,"I know you're out there
I can feel your eyes on me
Seen that face a thousand times
If only in my dreams

I know you really want me
I can feel your hands on me
I really wanna touch you too
In a way I'm much too shy to speak

And even though
I'm all alone
For what it's worth
You're somewhere here on Earth

And I like it

I know you're out there
I can feel you getting closer to me
I'm just wondering what you're waiting for
You know I am free

In this digital age, you could just page me
I know it's a rage, but it just don't engage me
I like the face to face
Do you want to do this at yours, or my place?

It's been so long
Since I been with somebody
Like a million years
Now you're here on Earth

You're here, you're here

Somewhere here on Earth
And I like it, I like it

Listen

I know you hear me
Like a whisper in your ear
You don't have to fear me
Your everything I hold so dear

I know you already love me
You're probably just too cool to say
Somebody somewhere put you down
But that's ok, that's ok

Cuz whenever you feel
It's time to heal
No, no more

I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely

Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her 
She walked in through the out door, out door

She wore a
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more

I think I love her

Built like she was
She had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm

I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't to bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks

She wore a 
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more

I think I love her

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star

Listen
They say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell ya
If I had the chance to do it all again
I wouldn't change a stroke
'Cause baby I'm the most

Turned up the stereo
About to raise the dead

Slipped in the bathroom

Walked in the closet
Tryin' to find something to wear

Then I check my email
To see where the party be
Change the names to protect the guilty

Should I bring somebody
Or dance alone?
It don't matter to me you'all
Cuz tonight is on

There is gonna be a scene

At me when I'm clean

Arms all around me
Soon as eye hit the door
Good thing I ate my spinach
You're thicker than before
Oh what's this boy doing
You he makin' that face
Don't he know I have crazy friends with me
Ready to tear up this place?

Can't you see this is inevitable
What's the use in wastin' time?
You and me we could be comfortable
All that takes is for you to make up your mind

With this car these rims this grill you'll be
The illest on the scene
Whatever whatever all you need is your music
And you'll b a party machine and you'll be

How many times you look for happy
And you never see the rich folks there?
But if the DJ really dropped a needle all the true players just don't care
When all the news just gimme the blues and make you wanna pop a pill
What difference does it make who got's the most bank, it's just ink and
Chlorophyll

I might go wild

What are you gonna with all this love?
What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do?

Maybe if you believe baby
That I would no deceive you
You and I side by side or somewhere
In between

I don't know if this is a bore
But I just can no longer ignore
This fact so sublime
You get better with time

Anyone who's met you agrees
That no one forgets you most of all not me
You can claim you're humble and hide
But when it's true my dear
It's not pride

A jury of my peers would find me
Guilty of so many crimes
If I chose not to remind you
That you get better with time

This might seem absurd
To someone so cultured
And to one who would grace any stage

With more rewards and accolades, then anyone before or after
21st century, oh what a shame, what a shame
Race, race still matters
A race to what, and where we going
We in the same boat, but I'm the only one rowing

Last time I checked, you were sleeping, but you can call me a dreamer too
(What's up with this)

Peanut butter logic, served on a bed of lies
Don't go down too easy, when you've seen your father cry
Have you ever clutched the steering wheel in your car too tight
Praying that police sirens just pass you by that night
While the helicopter circles us, this theory's getting deep
Think they're spraying chemicals over the city
While we sleep

Come on, I'm staying awake
you can call me a dreamer too
(I got one eye open for these devils)

(Wake up, wake up)

For you to try to get a page in my book

Threw you the ball

It hit three bystanders after you touched it

Prince,"I awoke to sirens, but all you heard was apologies. 
Was it too loud or not loud enough 
To move the mountains we built 
To the trenches we dug?
Repeating ourselves, 
Biting our own hands- counting how many fingers fit? 
How many fingers?

Sit and wait.

You make this look good, 
You make it look so good, 
Dressed up in riot gear for a prat fall good for profit. 
We claimed the product in the name of tragedy, 
Were so dramatic. 
Now I'm after pyramids, 
What would you rig that with plastic explosives and trip wire? 
And if we lost our arms, 
And lost our voice 
Could we trick ourselves- 
That we killed ourselves. 
Here come the sirens, were over and done for.

I can never stay awake long enough to see the ending.",Here

The apple of my daddy's eye
Cute but not jaded my hair in 2 braids
He looked at me and just said hi

Sometimes I'm all alone and don't c him
I wish it was different but I don't care

But I just can no longer ignore

Anyone who's met you agrees
That no one forgets you most of all not me
You can claim you're humble and hide
But when it's true my dear
It's not pride

A jury of my peers would find me
Guilty of so many crimes
If I chose not to remind you
That you get better with time

This might seem absurd
To someone so cultured
And to one who would grace any stage

With members of the opposite sex
We're going to have to debrief you thoroughly
Over the course of the next few sessions

Today though we'll just start off with some simple affirmations
That will be automatically induced into your memory temple
Which you can upload onto a hard drive
And review at your desire

Affirmation number I
There are no such words as me or mine

Words of this nature were introduced into society
As a control mechanism
Which systematically divided the subjects first individually
And then as a collective

From now on
Any person or object whatsoever that requires your attention
Is something that has veered from its path and preordained destiny
Of total enlightenment",Affirmation I & II

I trust you're having a quick and enjoyable adjustment period

Which makes things move so much faster here
After you've completed the planned affirmation therapy
You will find this way of interaction far easier

Until I, I find my, my way back home, home

You've probably felt for many years in you're former life
That you were separate from not only others, but even yourself
Now you can see that was never the case
You are actually everything and anything that you can think of
All of it is you

I've been missing out I just feel like a fool

Keep breaking me down, down, down

First one intoxicated, last one to leave
Waking up in places that you would never believe
Give me back the time, you can keep the memories

Keep breaking me down, down, down

Every book I've read said that I would meet somebody like you
Whenever I was sorry, so sorry for the things I used to do
A journal full of numbers that I used to go through
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) all behind me now, all because of you

Keep breaking me down, down, down

You keep breaking me, you keep breaking me down
I don't wanna walk out
Don't wanna go down, down, down

See there's a door that you can walk through
Where there used to be a wall
I don't care, it's cool as long as you catch me baby
(Catch me when I fall) If there's ever a fall
Closer to the breakdown, the closer we get",Breakdown

Sir, we know you're a little bit groggy
And you're probably going to find it hard to speak

We just want to let you know that the medication you were given
Has put you in a suspended animation for quite some time
Well, in fact, about 45 years

Is a place that does not require time

Prince,"Put your hands together
No, like this
Surprise, suprise
Another treat, another trick
This is sweet
Which one's which

For the record, let me state
That I never had a reason to
Break contractually or sever
Relationship with anyone I pleasure

For the playa, let me stop and say-a
That I only paid attention when
When I heard you mention that
He tried to take your treasure
Oh no he didn't

And as a matter of fact
I would have gave you back
But then he had a heart attack
When you made him pack
And said his shack without you would be better

See, what I really mean

See, what I really mean
Is that our future queen
Should never be in frustulation
With this rock and roll machine
Oh no not ever

You know how much I care

You know, you know, you know

You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone, he know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know

If you really wanna find the answer
To this Cancer, then we must rewind
Then nevermind the first opinion
You better act surprised

To run this game requires fame
You stole a name and nothing gained
Unless you sacrifice my dear
It's only claim for his dominion

And any question of the deal
Is met with another demand to kneel
And reprimand concealed allegations of you sinning

That's why
Feminine wiles are not surprised
In recognizing that the power of the breasts
Is just a test that you'll be winning

You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone, he know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know

You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone, he know I'm gonna flaunt you

Scripted role, huh a trophy wife
All I ever wanted, to be left alone
See my bed's made up at night
'Cause in my dreams I roam
Just trying to find, trying to find
My way back, back home

So many reasons why
There's so many reasons why
I don't belong here
But now that I am I
Without fear I am
Gonna conquer with no fear
Until I find my way back home
Until I find my way back home

With a dream outside my head (outside my head)

But if they don't stay together

Will it be on land or near the water
Will it produce the sun or the black moon daughter

With unmistakable

Her winter coat and sexy tokes
On camel smokes
Don't prepare you
For a laugh that explodes

A princess and a mistress
Dressed in Sunday best
To impress a fresh love, interest

To set the stage
Receive her praise
And leave a sour taste
That only gets sweeter as it fades

She just can't help being a girl
She just can't help being a girl
She just can't help herself
Full of spectacle and charm like nothing else

At the initial glance
She's making plans to build her a man
Like a T-4 or an airplane
The girl wants a model romance

Fell in love
While taming her new adventurer
'Cause every rebel
Needs a woman's touch

The fact is she's an actress
Using the bedroom for practice
Making him think
His kiss is all she ever imagines

With a pocketful of rocket fuel
Dragging strings that pull
On a heart, that's uncertain
But beautiful

She just can't help being a girl

Prince Buster,"The Ten Commandments from man given to woman
Through the inspiration of I, Prince Buster
One, thou shall have no other man but me
Two, thou shall not encourage no man to make love to you
Neither kiss nor caress you
For I am your man, a very jealous man
And is ready to lay low any other man that may intrude in our love

Three, remember to kiss and caress me
Honor and obey me, in my every whim and fancy
Seven days a week and twice on Sundays
Because at no time will I ever be tired of I-T, it

Honor my name so that every other woman may honor it also
Five, thou shall not provoke me to anger
Or my wrath will descend upon you heavily
Commandment Six, thou shall not search my pockets at night
Or annoy me with your hearsays

Commandment Seven, thou shall not shout my name in the streets
If I'm walking with another woman
But wait intelligently until I come home
Then we both can have it out decently
For I am your man, a funny man
And detest a scandal in public places

Commandment Eight, thou shall not drink, nor smoke
Nor use profane language
For those bad habits I will not stand for
Nine, thou shall not commit adultery
For the world will not hold me guilty if I commit
Murder

Ten, thou shall not covet thy neighbor's dress
Nor her shoes, nor her bureau, nor her bed, nor her hat
Nor anything that's hers
Neither shall thou call my attention to anything that may be for sale
In any stores, for I will not give thee anything but what
You actually need for your purpose

Those are the Ten Commandments given from man to woman

Ha, yeah. I know what you're all thinking
That this is some old Janet Jackson type of @#!
But it ain't about that
This if the real, the street life trauma

Yo, I grew up rough in the streets of Boston, Massachusetts
Lived real ruthless, a wild kid, out to get a bid
Did some #@! that he never shoulda did
Had to learn the hard way
That some day you gotta pay
So what the hey, I say

Prince Ital Joe:
Life in the streets ain't easy
All I see is pain and misery
I kneel and pray for the betrayed
Strength and protection to survive in the society

This is the life in the streets
And that's how we live it

Marky Mark:
Hard and mean at sixteen, livin' like a beam, theme
Out scheming for the green
Quick to kill, I gets ill, I make ya blood spill
I cut ya throat for your goose-down coat
'cause statistic show that kids with no dough
Ain't got no chance, got nowhere to go
That's why life on the streets is like a trifular beat
It'll echo in ya head till you're dead on the concrete

Prince Ital Joe:
Life in the streets is a mystery
Don't know my friends from my enemies
Up to lot, could be trouble
But I'll hold tight and I will never give up the fight

(Chorus)

This one is dedicated to all the homeless people
To every youth that's growin' up on the streets
You know, we're living for a dream one day
That there'll be no more homeless people in the world
Life in the streets is not easy

Prince Kay One,"We wasn't always motherfuckin' rich
I'mma tell you a little story
'Bout our past (past, past)

Früher hatte ich nichts, ja, wir hatten nicht viel
Mama hat gesagt, du erreichst dein Ziel
Wenn du nicht aufgibst, also trau dich
Aber wenigstens hast du es probiert
Mein Sohn, flieg weit, weit
Weg von hier, flieg weit, weit
Weg von hier, flieg weit, weit
Weg von hier, aber wenigstens hast du es probiert

Jeden Tag draußen mit den Jungs chill'n, abhäng'n und schwänzen
Nachts auf das Dach, uns're Stadt war am Glänzen
Grenzen gab's nicht, als Kids schon Rebell'n
Uns're Denkweise war zu oft: Fick diese Welt
AP, von Hip-Hop-Jam zu Hip-Hop-Jam
Ich saß im Zug und lernte Hip Hop kenn'
Kein Geld, broke, früh aus dem Elternhaus raus
Mein Plan war, Ich komm zurück und bau ein Traumhaus
Falsch gedacht, falsch gedacht
Bekam 'ne Wohnung ohne Strom, es war kalt und nass
Vergesse nie den Kühlschrank, der jeden Tag leer war
Köln-Kalk, Hungersnot, jede Nacht schmerzhaft
Kaltes Wasser, Teekerzen leuchten
Lieber Gott, was soll das alles hier bedeuten?
Ein Leben zwischen kriminellen Freunden
Das war nicht die Vision aus meinen Träumen
Und in Berlin war's vielleicht ein Stück besser
Doch ganz bestimmt kein Glückstreffer
Ja, Gott hat mich hier hingeführt und wieder weggebracht
Durch das finst're Tal, doch ich hab's echt geschafft

Früher hatte ich nichts, ja, wir hatten nicht viel
Mama hat gesagt, du erreichst dein Ziel
Wenn du nicht aufgibst, also trau dich
Aber wenigstens hast du es probiert
Mein Sohn, flieg weit, weit
Weg von hier, flieg weit, weit
Weg von hier, flieg weit, weit

Orgasmus, wenn sie einem die Hand gibt, Augen wie Bambi
Candy Parfum
Yve Saint Laurent
Ihre Art und wie sie redet

Dreh den Sound auf Marvin Gay

Das macht ihr Angst, aber das versteh ich
Diesen ganzen Mädels
Doch für sie würd ich mich ändern
Und nie wieder Bitches kennen lernen
Nie mehr Party, sinnlos ausgehen
Sondern sie zu meiner Frau nehmen
Und ich hoff nur, dass sie mir das alles abkauft
Dann führ ich sie heut Nacht auf

Genieß' diese Einsamkeit, ich höre oft
Man hat dich hier und dort gesehen mit ihm gesehen

Auf dem Tisch rumgeknutscht warst nicht zu retten

Sag wie krass bist du drauf?
Ich erkenn' dich nicht mehr das bist du nicht
Erzähl mir nicht dass du glücklich bist erzähl mir nicht
Dass es sich gelohnt hat, lüg' nich'

Wer ist jetzt da wenn du krank bist
Wenn's dir schlecht geht

Ich weiß nicht ob deine Nummer noch aktuell is' umm
Ich wollt mich bei dir melden und dir sagen
Dass es mir gut geht und
Ich hier halt glücklich bin und umm
Drum schick ich auch meine Nummer nicht auch nicht mit
Ich glaub es is'besser so
Aber tu mir bitte ein Gefallen und pass auf dich auf
Bis dann tchau

Ich denk an uns und schreib diesen Text jetzt
Ich vermiss dich immernoch und es stresst echt
Mein Pech wächst seit dem Tag
Als du mich verlassen hast, komm allein nicht klar, immer
Partys hier, Partys da, du bist gegangen
My first love, ja, ich hatt' kein Geld
Ich hatt' kein Fame, damals hieß ich noch Kenneth
Es gab kein Kay doch du hast mich geliebt
Geliebt wie ich bin, vielleicht war ich ein Arsch
Doch Liebe macht blind, aber du warst da, mein Superstar
Ich hatt' kein Problem mit dem Zug zu fahren
Egal wo du warst, ich bin gekomm'n
In der Zeit kannt' ich kein Dom Perignon
Ich war broke und ich konnt dich nirgends einladen
Aber trotzdem sprachen wir vom Heiraten
Lass mich dir eins sagen
Ich vermiss diese Zeit
Wär so gern wieder glücklich vereint, aber nein

Dieses Leben ist kein Wunschkonzert
Ich hab ein' wunden Punkt im Herz

(My first love) Ich will die Zeit zurückdrehn'
Und mit dir ein kleines Stück gehn'

Für die Zeit, es tut mir Leid

Ich hoff' dir geht's gut

Bis jetzt hat's noch keine geschafft
Mein Herz zu bekommen, ich vergleich dich, mein Schatz
Mit jeder Frau die ich kennenlern' und es nervt echt
Keine hier ist perfekt
Manche sind sehr nett, hey und manche nur hübsch
In manchen steckt auch 'ne Bitch
Es ist wie es ist, es kommt wie es kommt, Schicksal
Als die Quittung kam war klar, ich zahl
Ich sah bei uns Zukunft, doch vielleicht waren wir zu jung
„geh mit ihr gut um!“, drohte dein Daddy
Ich hatt' kein Geld doch kaufte dein Blackberry
Denn mir war's egal, ich hab dich geliebt
Und ohne dich leben, macht depressiv
In der Nacht so aktiv, du raubst mein Schlaf, kein Scheiß
Und da hilft kein Geld, da hilft kein Hype
Denn wahre Liebe kannst du nicht kaufen
Die eine unter 100.000

Dieses Leben ist kein Wunschkonzert
Ich hab ein' wunden Punkt im Herz

Yeah, 5 6 7 Bitches an mei'm Tisch ich bin der Bachelor
Werd niemals sesshaft, ich schätz mal, dass keiner so viel Cash macht

Ich verdien' noch mehr als jeder Chefarzt
Und vögel' nur die schönsten aus Odessa
Karibik, Venezuela, Dicker erste Klasse, Standard
Ich hab noch meine Ketten an also Baby langsam
Baby ich bin anders
Anders wie die anderen, ich steh auf um 16 Uhr
Dann gibt es Kameras und Champagner, Lisa, Annkathrin und Sandra
Ja ich schaff' euch drei allein und bleib dabei
Ist meiner steif steht er so wie eine eins, Beine breit
Meine Rhymes, meine Lines alleine der Hype
Lassen mich mehr scheinen als ein Michael Mind zu seiner Zeit
Biker-Style Motorradjacke immer geil
So 'ne Latte, guck was ich in einem verfickten Monat mache
Ap Millionaires Club, guck wie sieh den Herd putzt
Und jeder jetzt den Schwanz vom Prince of Belvedere lutscht

Irgendwie muss ich nach Hollywood ich wäre gern Richie Rich
Auf dem roten Teppich chillen mit den ganzen VIPs
Heute steig ich in den Jet ein und fliege zu ihm

Weiße Gucci Schuhe
Man ich lieb es wenn sie glänzen
Scheiß auf Liebe denn für mich zählt nur noch Beamer, Benz und Bentley
Und ach egal ich bin jetzt Selfmade Millionär
Doch ich krieg nicht genug verdammt ich will noch mehr Gold
Will noch mehr Wertanlagen, tausend Uhren,
Auf der Tour siehst du außer Huren nichts auf dem Flur
Radisson und Twist unter 5 Sternen geht nichts
Im 500er Mercedes sitz ich, drin mit drei, vier Mädels
Früher Prince heute König aus dem Kind wurde ein Schönling
Und auf meinem Schweizer Konto liegt bestimmt ein Vermögen
Hated nicht aber ich lasse Taten sprechen
Ich chill in Miami geht mal weiter eure Nasen Brechen

10 Stunden lang ficken ist, was ich auf Jay kann

Prince Kay One,"Ich hab gedacht, dass es leicht wär
Es wird mir klar, ich muss eins lern'
Schmerz geht, doch die Narben sind für immer
Die Hoffnung scheint unauffindbar
War ich zu jung oder nur zu dumm?
Das mit dir hatte Zukunft
Schatz, ich wollte was festes
Es war'n deine Worte, entweder so oder man lässt es
Ich gab dir mein Wort, hab noch geschwor'n
War noch im Studio, machte 'nen Song
Jeden Tag draußen, Kino, spazier'n
All diese Bilder, sie sind noch hier
Verdammt, ich vermiss dich
Komm zurück, ich werd' anders nicht glücklich
Und ja, ich versteh, was du meinst
All meine Fehler, ich seh sie jetzt ein, dass ich
Nicht da war, das tut mir so Leid
Du hast noch versucht, nicht zu wein'
Auch wenn du jetzt glücklich bist
Bitte vergiss mich nicht, Gott beschütze dich

Zusammen mit dir aufsteh'n, ich sehn' mich so sehr
Die Zeit will nicht vergeh'n, jetzt erkenn' ich dein Wert
Und manchmal tut es weh, wenn man etwas verliert
Die Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt, deshalb blick ich zur Tür

Doch es gibt kein Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n
Denn es ist so viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n
Allein geh ich jetzt diesen Weg, diesen Weg, diesen Weg
Hast du nicht gesagt „Ich begleit dich ins Grab?“

Wenn ich aufsteh und am Frühstücken bin
Schatz, glaub mir, ich fühl mich so schlimm
Kein Chill'n, kein Kuscheln, kein Sex
Ich sitz nur zuhause und schreib Tracks
Doch jeder Track ist über dich
Ich will, dass es wieder wie früher ist
Weißt du noch, unser erster Kuss
Unser erstes Date, brachte dich zum Bus
Alles war zu schön, doch was ist jetzt?
Das passiert, wenn man jemanden nicht schätzt
Ja, du bist weg, aber wohin?
Sag, warum war ich so blind?
Nein, Geld macht nicht glücklich
Was bringt ein 5-Sterne-Koch, wenn du nichts isst?
Was bringt dir Urlaub allein, Champagner und Wein?
Nein, es bringt dir nichts, wenn du kein' hast zum Teil'n
Jetzt bist du frei, also genieß diese Zeit
Baby, nie wieder Streit und ich will, dass du weißt
Dass ich immer da bin
Bitte pass auf sie auf, amen

Zusammen mit dir aufsteh'n, ich sehn' mich so sehr
Die Zeit will nicht vergeh'n, jetzt erkenn' ich dein Wert
Und manchmal tut es weh, wenn man etwas verliert
Die Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt, deshalb blick ich zur Tür

Doch es gibt kein Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n
Denn es ist so viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n
Allein geh ich jetzt diesen Weg, diesen Weg, diesen Weg
Hast du nicht gesagt „Ich begleit dich ins Grab?“

Wenn wir zwei allein
Jetzt uns're Wege geh'n
Ich hoff, du weißt
Egal, was auch passiert
Ich bin für dich da
Ich hoff, es gibt ein Wiederseh'n

Doch es gibt kein Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n
Denn es ist so viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n
Allein geh ich jetzt diesen Weg, diesen Weg, diesen Weg
Hast du nicht gesagt „Ich begleit dich ins Grab?“",Wiedersehen
Prince Kaywood,"It seem to me that we don't always get along
If we are trying now don't seem to try too long
Watching your neighbour seems to fill you with alarm
Just 'cause he's different now
Don't mean he means you harm
City living has got us all pent up inside
When we have problems it seems we all just run and hide
Time to discover why we are feeling this way
Let's let love have its say

I know you need it, brother said he needs it, sister said she needs it, 
We're all gonna need it someday
We seem to loose our way, somehow got led astray
That's why I'm here to say, gotta get back get back to love
I know you need it, brother said he needs it, sister said she needs it, 
We're all gonna need it someday
We seem to loose our way, somehow got led astray
That's why I'm here to say, gotta get back get back to it now

Trouble started when we don't communicate
We'll build our future now or we can seal our fate
Wasted energy on promises we break
We've wasted chance now, but still it ain't too late
There is a common goal we must all realize
It's time to make a change, in how we live our lives
Time to discover why, we are feeling this way
Let's let love save the day",Back to Love
Prince Lasha,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Always had jewels but never got moved on

I pump your ass so full of holes you would think you was swiss cheese

So save your pleadin' it won't help none
Don't kiss ass, because you're kissin' the barrel of my shotgun
Check the glock let me surprise ya

From Queens to Bronx but nothin' gets props like
Brooklyn - no disrespect

I gotta make a stop at the boom spot then go get some brew
A quart of Olde E, no time to sip so I chug
Puff a blunt as a chaser now it's time to bug

Got the raven two-five, inside of my denim
Some said I was the child with the devil in him
But all that bull I ain't tryin' to hear
It's all about gainin' respect from my peers

'Cause you'll never meet a brother more hardcore
A good head on my shoulders but I'm ghetto bound
I got heart, step to this, and catch a beatdown

So, punks plays hard, understand that they givin though
Respect by a brother whose lifestyle is livin low

Yeah... here we go, dig it
Well as life moved on, things got more hectic
Things were worth more than just respect
I would snatch money bags and boost at Macy's

And never get caught, when the cops would chase me
See I was livin' life like a comic book villain
Gettin' in trouble when I should of been chillin'
For nine-to-five workers it was hell

Cashin' checks and now tax at gunpoint
I did it for the money, excitement and fun point

Play ""Silence of the Lambs"" when they ask ya
It didn't matter cause my moms was scared of me

Here we go - take me back to school, dig it

Locked up for the first time I gotta play the tough role
I'm doin' ten for a body up North yo
I'm forced to shank this kid with a ice pick

A little brother never steppin' from conflict
Some want to test me and some want to own me
I'm still snuffin' out chumps to be known be	
I gotta live for self and that's scary

You see I only feel safe in solitary
I never regret or feel guilt, cause I was forced to
Take what I had play bad because you
Never understood me or what I came past

Don't you know those other kids takin the same path
But I can handle it, well in stride
The only difference is I'm locked inside
Take it like a champ, and I'll never show no frown

Hey little girl take a hold of my hand
And let me tickle your G, until you can't withstand
It was once said, a brother like me couldn't whip ya

But daddy got deep, now your head's gonna trip
A real all true man, Markie Dee's the freak one
who stay in your back - shh - don't even speak hon
I know you wanted it from your first look at me

[Chorus]

Ah-yo sugar, sexy, boo my sweet thing
Pappy slap me, make me happy
Jingle your earrings, and all that good stuff
'Cause I'm a make you happy do you want to call my bluff

And if you do, then step inside
Take me back to school and let your legs divide
I know what you want and what you're thinkin'
And every other brother is dead and stinkin'

And all up on your body I will be grippin'
'Cause if I didn't make you happy I would be slippin'
So just ride, the merry go round and round
Then I pound, your body down to the ground

Just let me know, when you've had enough
So we can take a break and I can kiss your stuff
I know you wanted it from your first look at me

[Chorus]

Here we go, breakdown..

(Yeah baby) Say love daddy baby, come on
(Love daddy!) Yeah..

Check it out (I'll make you so, very happy)
Ever since I was young I made the girlies drip
And if loving's a sin, me and the devil are kin
So would you like to ride on a, rough, rider?

And if you got a friend we can play inside her
I'm leavin' girls with cool-Aid smiles
I keep you occupied with different styles
Tell momma don't cook, cause tonight I'm gonna eat out

And I can keep the pace even when I pull the beat out
So come and get some of this scrumptious basty
mouth-waterin' creamy pastry
And you can have it when you want it with ease

Just call me up and say daddy please
You run and tell your friends to try this here
Cause you know that I can leave 'em with a smile and a tear
I know you wanted it from your first look at me

[Chorus]

Yeah, come on baby
Let's head on back to my room
Yeah
Come on you know you want it just as bad as I do

'Cause I know, that you know, that I know, that you know
(I'll make you so, very happy)
Yeah
Let's head on back to my room baby

Come on
'Cause I know, that you know, that you know, that I know
(I'll make you so, very happy)
Yeah",So Very Happy
Prince Markie Dee,"Call, call my name 
Call it, call my name 

I heard your voice this morning calling out my name 
It had been so long since I heard it that it didn't sound quite the same, no 
But it let me know that my name had never really been spoken before
Before the day I carried you through the bridal path door 

And ever since that day I haven't wanted anyone but you
And anybody who really knows me knows the truth 

[Chorus]
I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much 
I just can't wait to get my arms around you 
And feel your touch 
If I don't see you real soon baby girl 
I might go insane 
I know it's only been about 3 hours 
But I love it when you call my name 

I heard a voice on the news saying people want to stop the war 
If they had a love as sweet as you they'd forget what they were fighting for
What's the matter with the world today? 
The land of the free? Somebody lied 
They can bug my phone and people 'round my home 
They'll only see you and me making love inside 

[Chorus]

I've never seen the moon look so lovely as the night I saw it with you
It let me know I'd never seen the moon before 
So many speak of the moon as though it had no flaws 
But to compare it to a beauty like yours would give one pause 
Nothing about you is false, that's why your love is real 
God forbid if you belonged to another I'd have to steal you 
I'd have to take you from your man 
I might be tempted to break the law round here 
Because your beauty, it gives one pause 
It slows me down 

[Chorus]",Call My Name
Prince Markie Dee,"Want to get lost in the mellow Mellow of my mind
Chop a tree, pay the cost
I rather have a glass of you that's fine
Come on over baby 'round 7
Chill in you're favorite chair

You can watch a tape of this mellow after party
Macy and Common were there
Besides, you know... it takes... awhile... 4 me... 2 do... my... hair

Come on get lost in the mellow Mellow
Come on get lost in the mellow Mellow

How's that feel?

Where you want to eat 2nite baby?
I know this dope spot called one another
Or maybe we might swing by the Egg
The perfect place 2 play house
I could smother you
I just might be runnin' lines
There's just so much you can find
In the mellow of my mind

This rainbow psychedelic
Come and get lost in the Mellow
There ain't nothin' 2 be	 afraid of
Just you and me in the mellow of my mind

I want to get lost in the composition of you
Learn the rhythm and play only the notes you want me 2
I'm a good learner and once I understand
I'll stand under you and let you show me how you want you're man 2 be	
I could dance 4 you- a little comical minuet
If you desire I'll shed my attire
Anything 2 get you wet.

Shower, my flower?
So much 2 do, so little time
So choose wisely and you can find thee
In the Mellow of my mind

Can I sing 2 you while you bring yourself 2 joy?
I'll go slow at first, while you quench you're thirst
Wet circles round the toy
While you bring yourself 2 joy

As she fell in2 the Sensual Everafter, out of bodyout of mind,
She stroked her hair a hundred times.
And as she fell deeper in2 the hypnotic unwind, he counted his way in2 the suggestive mind.

He said, ""Repeat after me. Repeat after me. Repeat after me. 1+1+1 is 3""",Mellow
Prince Markie Dee,"Chorus One:  (Onome) 

Tell me that you want it
Say that you need it
Tell me that you want it
Tell me that you want it
Say that you need it
Tell me that you want it

Verse One:  (Markie Dee)

Love, let me break it down as clear as I can
I'll be suddenly smooth so you can understand
I look gentle, gentle as sun rays 
Calm as a cool breeze
Flowing through your mind with ease
It seems that you want to be more than friends
But all I want to do is to make commence 
My live style keeps me on the move
So just let me explain how you get in my groove 

Chorus One

Verse Two:

It seems you're looking for a faithful
Kind and committed man
And you considered L.D. for the part
Now what makes you think that I'm the man for your hand?
If you plan to reprimand my love and my heart
Now when we first met you were cool
Far from your everyday hoe
That's only out for the doe 
But in time you feelings started to climb
Baby came a little stronger then mind

Chorus One

Verse Three:

Far from your typical I never kick the same old smooth kind of line
To catch a young girls mind
See, what I'm saying is real
It really means a lot to me how you feel
No disrespect, but lovers I don't want to be
All I see is someone I can talk to in front of me
Stop what you're doing
Cause I don't want to ruin
The bond that we got
Cause I like it a lot
You need a man who can give you his all
Stand by your side, pick you up when you fall
For me I be the one that you rely on
The shoulder that you cry on
Someone that will always be near
Through thick or thin
I'm your friend to the end
You're more that just skins love, you're someone who cares
Sit me down and confide what you're feeling inside
If you need me then call and I'll be at your side

Chorus Two:  (Onome)

You just call
I'm your man
And you know, where ever I am
I'll go running
Run in the sea
Winter, Spring, and Summer, Fall I'll be with you

(Repeat Chorus Two 7x)

You just call

You just call

Handle your time like a man yo 

So it's my twenty-third birthday, drinkin brew-no 
You know no matter what it take, we gotta celebrate 
Fuck stayin straight, hair braided by this Muslim cat 
Regulate the whole yard, now we got the straps 
Niggas say ""Who the fuck is that?"" 
The X-Man, rowdy, gettin treated like the feds in the county 
Correctional facilities, basically you don't want to fuck wit these 
Murders and felonies keep you company (""YEAH!"") 

And yes y'all, come on in (""YEAH"") 
All you brand new heffer, sissy, soft booty-ass shook niggas (""YEAH"") 
Yeah bitch, welcom to central booking (""YEAH"") 
A sleep-over for pimps, private hustlers (""YEAH""), drug slingers, and gun clappers 
Even bitch-ass, shook-ass niggas (""YEAH"") like y'all 
Get on your ?(""YEAH""), get out the blood on your ?married character? 
Kitten-ass faces (""YEAH""), niggas about to beat you all down to the last stop 

I'm all good, as I telephone my hood 
At first I was shook, tried to play by the book 
But you can't bid your time by stayin in the cell 
I'm gettin high everyday like I was still on the corner 
Where I'm in fat pink caps, New York to California 
Makin deals for mills, holdin cigarette lottos 
Givin cats pills, and tell em ""Yo try those!"" 
Niggas try to scheme but my team is tight 
We as shady as the night and bring fright to sight 
Hey you be aight, but don't act like a sucka 
Ain't you ain't got to be the wildest mothafucker 
Use control, put a cat in whole if he's broke 
And let em know, I just want to serve my time and go 
And flow, lay low, try to grab some dough 
Aiyyo I ain't tryin to jail, somebody post my bail 

This is your new home boss, where you survive at all costs 
And if you don't, well it's only your loss 
You're only here 'cause you tried to force and be the boss, ha 
Handle your time like a man yo

Yo man shhh, I need some new kicks man

Or something man, I ain't get no letters man 
(You gone be my bitch tonight, what) 
Niggas forgettin about me man 
(I'll poke y'all, don't come on the island) 
Namsayin, supposed to be my crew 
(Don't be on the island when I get there) 
Can't even make collect phone calls 
(Mothafucker, what ah um!) 
Tryin to jam my collect calls now 
(You will be mines tonight mothafucker!) 
Nobody ain't home, nobody want to write me (Mine you hear me!)

Ain't nobody put no money on my book

Just an MC hustlin', hustlin' (Repeat 2X)
I'm just an MC hustlin', hustlin'
Just an MC hustlin', hustlin'

I'm a general, in this hip hop army, yeah
Highly ranked, thick like a tank
Well-equipped for niggas poppin' shit
Rapifier, now plug the wire let's get down to it
I'm frustrated, uh, filled with anger
Feel like jumpin' in the wash and just chill on the hanger
But uh, mama didn't raise no quitters
So uh, what you want and what you need I deliver

[Chorus: ]

Mass confusion, boozin', drug using
Got some winning some losing, is it real or an illusion?
I guess it's all a test, stress to paranoia
Slim, go get a lawyer, make him prove nobody saw ya
The clock struck the midnight hour, I hit the ?
I see my man Infinite pimpin' shit for the team
The millionaires club, Republicans make it difficult
Kill or be killed's the result, I'm rollin' up
The ?, drinkin' ?, talkin' sports
Herb smoke stimulates my thoughts
It took me deeper than the reaper's domain
To make it plain as hell
I left my spirit to dwell
But let my lyrics rebel
Documented on record to spark my ? brain cell
I kick a style like Bruce, rockin' this rotten metropolis
Drugs, thugs and slugs, the scene it's so monotonous
One day it dawned on me as the time rolls by
That the same thing that makes you laugh makes you cry
Sometimes I feel I'm winnin', sinnin',
Sittin' back in the MP, relax, talkin' bout a new beginning
You see, I'm just an MC, I'm just an MC...

[Chorus: ]

I gotta get over, before I go under
I gotta get over, before I go under-privileged
Trapped deep beneath the sewage
I attend the University of Making Money
Five makes ten, ten makes twenty
Good n' plenty, keeps pockets from getting empty
Blunts get pulled, different day same bull
Shit, you can't own it, two (?) you manufacture it
Take away profit now tell me what you get
I got a size eight, a fried chicken dinner plate
I'm sellin' dreams, you know, rhymes by the weight
Ten years of hustling, brung home the bacon, man
More scramblin' than Moon and Cunningham
You know, money for the makin', maintainin'
Hustlin', for the president, causin' campaignin' (?)

In this year the mayor's up for reelection 
So rat out all the competition in your section

Such a funny thing but every time you're near me
I never can behave

You give me a smile and then I'm wrapped up in your magic
There's music all around me, crazy music
Music that keeps calling me so, very close to you
Turns me a slave

Come and do with me any little thing you want to
Anything baby just let me get next to you
Am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above, you're in the clear blue sky

How I worry about you
Just can't live my life without you, baby come here
Don't have NO fear, ohhh is there a wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love

This little dream might fade away
There ago I'm talking out of my head again
Oh baby won't you come and put our, two hearts together
That would make me strong and brave

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud up above us, go on and let it rain
I'm sure our love together can endure a hurricane
Oh my baby, won't you please let me love you
And give you relief from this awful misery

What is all this talk, about loving me, my sweet
I am not afraid, not anymore
Not like before, don't you understand me?
Won't you please pull yourself, together, do it soon
My soul's on fire, come on and take me
I'll be what you make me, my darling, my sweet

Like Mobb Deep, you got me all shook, uhh

Yeah, your love is real good honey
It even feels better cause I didn't pay money

Oh baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that, new promised land

And maybe there, we can find
A cool place to keep our lovin' state of mind

Prince Rashie,"Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

",Come to Me
Prince Royce,"Anoche soñé yo contigo del amor que perdimos
Del amor que tanto he sufrido y ahora estoy perdido
Tú me decías que me amabas
Pero en mi espalda tu me engañabas
Por eso es que nuestro amor ha fracasado

Tal vez no sabes cuanto te amé pero siempre lloré
Aunque tu nunca mi amor lo hayas notado
Tus labios me decían te amo
Y tus ojos me rechazaban
Por eso es que hoy yo mujer ya no te creo

Yo te amé, te adoré
No te quiero ver
Y sufrí hasta el fin
No te quiero ver

Yo te amé, te adoré
No te quiero ver
Y sufrí hasta el fin
No te quiero ver

Duramos una noche amando y la otra pelando
Y aunque todo siguió igual, pasaban los años
A pesar de tus engaños, tú me diste un milagro
Ese fruto de tu vientre que yo más amo

Yo te amé, te adoré
No te quiero ver
Y sufrí hasta el fin
No te quiero ver

Yo te amé, te adoré
No te quiero ver
Y sufrí hasta el fin
No te quiero ver

Prince Royce,"Tienes todos los espacios
Inundados de tu ausencia
Inundados de silencio
No hay palabras, no hay perdón

Tu me tienes olvidado
No respondes al llamado
No eches tierra a la palabra
Me condenas a la nada
No me entierres sin perdón

Mira corazón que es el engaño
Se revierte y hace daño
Se revienta en el aire
Como pompas de jabón

Como pude haberte yo herido
Engañarte y ofendido
Alma gemela no te olvido
Aunque me arranque el corazón

Ay! el rencor que nos envenena
Nos hace daño
Aunque no regreses corazón
Has de perdonarme

El verdadero amor perdona
No abandona, no se quiebra
No aprisiona, no revienta
Como pompas de jabón

Un error es algo humano
No justifico la traición
Los amantes verdaderos
Se comprenden, se aman
Y se olvidan del rencor

La noche empieza a amotinarse
De sueños rotos y el dolor
Y me revuelco en esta cama
Aferrándome a la nada
Implorando tu perdón

Mira corazón cuanto te extraño
Pasan días, pasan años
Y mi vida se revienta
Como pompas de jabón

Como pude haberte yo herido
Engañarte y ofendido
Alma gemela no te olvido
Aunque me arranque el corazón

Ay! el rencor que nos envenena
Nos hace daño
Aunque no regreses corazón
Has de perdonarme

El verdadero amor perdona
No abandona, no se quiebra
No aprisiona, no revienta
Como pompas de jabón

El verdadero amor perdona
El verdadero amor perdona
Si el amor es verdadero
No se quiebra, no abandona
El verdadero amor perdona
Si el amor es verdadero
No se quiebra, no abandona
Si el amor es verdadero
No se quiebra, no abandona",El Verdadero Amor Perdona

Sleeping in, Sunday morning
Bodies intertwined
Playing fake, we're awake
But we don't wanna rise

I saved a place on my chest
For you to rest your head on me
A part of me is a mess
I must confess
Is time to come clean

I am addicted to your touch
No other woman's made me want it this much
I cannot resist the warmth of your hips
A single serving is never enough
'Cause I'm addicted to your touch

My schedule is yours today
I'm not in a rush
You could be my little coffee bean
And I will be the moon

Let's rent a movie tonight
And snuggle up inside

And when the credits arrive
I'll be by your side
Letting you know

I am addicted to your touch
No other woman's made me want it this much
I cannot resist the warmth of your hips
A single serving is never enough
'Cause I'm addicted to your touch

Yeah
I want your neck
I want your shoulders
I want to be the only one that holds ya
I want your legs, I want your arms
I wanna be inside your heart

If I don't have you next to me
I'll probably lose my sanity
I am hooked on you addicted

I am addicted to your touch
No other woman's made me want it this much
I cannot resist the warmth of your hips
A single serving is never enough
'Cause I'm addicted to your touch

The ladder you gotta be climbing
You always just check on your status

Girl, what's been happening lately?
We don't even talk no more
I be getting high on the low
All the guys on your phone
Lately all the vibes gone cold
I see it in your eyes
In your tone, I can hear it

Spoke about the future, I wasn't in it
Said you had plans for a man and a Bentley
But you should've been here when your boy was in the Civic

Say she from Los Angeles
Never seen her on my side of town
No Instagram, she famous though
Was around when we first came in here
Pull the chains out and that changes stuff
She a dime but ain't no changing her
She need a sugar daddy and my cane is up
I swear if you walk right by me
It's gon' be hard for you to say bye to me
The bottles is bottomless
I'm buying everything my finger land on like Monopoly
But you ain't nobody's property
And you want a bag worth a house note
How so?
Show me what it's worth, boo

End this pain, I ain't slept in days now
Come back home, so I won't be lonely

Prince Royce,"Fue manejando por la noche y pienso en ti 
Y en tantas cosas que no te llegué a decir 
Y la luna desde lejos me acompaña 
Y me trae tantos recuerdos que perdí 

Y en la radio está tocando tu canción 
La que bailamos tantas veces tú y yo 
Y la lluvia cae tan fuerte en mi ventana 
Y se evapora como gotas de tu amor 

Y las luces de los autos brillan como las estrellas 
En el cielo del dolor 
El camino va pasando y yo voy acelerando 
Como quien busca el amor 
Yo te busco, como un loco, dime 

¿Dónde estarás? ¿Dónde estarás? 
¿Todavía piensas en mí? 
¿Dónde estarás? ¿Dónde estarás? 
Yo sigo pensando en ti 

Quiero saber si todavía te quedará 
Un poquito de amor por mí 
La carretera se hace larga 
Y yo siento que puedo morir

Voy manejando creo que va a salir el sol 
Que diera yo por estar en tu habitación 
Tu contestador responde mi llamada 
Dejo grabado un mensaje con mi voz 

Y te digo que te extraño 
Que eres tu toda mi vida 
Que me ahogo en el alcohol 
Que no acepto que termine esta historia tan bonita 
Esta historia de los dos 
Que ese tipo que pretende 
Secuestrarme tus caricias no va a ser mejor que yo
No lo dudes, mi amor, dime

Learning all the perfect ways
To hate you with love
I'll be counting down the days
'Till I don't need you

Just don't let nobody but me

If I'm foolish
I'll be there

Too far for more

Espero qué tú también 
Conserves los deseos de amanecer 
En mis brazos otra vez 

Pues tengo unas ganas locas 
De tocar tú cuerpo, de besar tú boca
Quiero hacerte mía 
Una noche detrás de otra 

Juro que siento que en cada momento 
Que paso a tu lado se detiene el tiempo
Sobre tus mejillas
Como si todo mi universo 

Dependiera solo de ti
Es que por ti yo puedo ser
Mejor de lo que fui ayer
Por verte feliz, mujer

Necesito mucho de ti
Es que por ti yo puedo ser
Mejor de lo que soñé
Por tenerte a ti mujer

Bailemos pegadito, pégate despacio
Te quiero probar, sentir tu pelo lacio
Y báilame lento así, mujer
Tranquila que nadie aquí nos va a ver

Báilame y suéltate
Aclárame al ladito, así yo quiero
Afincado como si fuera bolero

Báilame y suéltate
Aclárame al ladito, así yo quiero

How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Détenaient un secret 
Qu'ils ont gardé pendant plus de vingt ans 
Et ça a bouleversé sa vie 
Il me semble tellement fragile parfois 
Que traverser cette phase difficile m'effraie, tu vois 

Il a donc découvert que Jonathan 
N'était pas son père biologique 
Et qu'il a connu sa maman 
Quand elle était enceinte de lui 
Il semble beaucoup leur en vouloir 
Même s'il a toujours eu de l'amour 
Et du savoir tous les jours 

Il voudrait chercher à connaître la vérité 
Il faudra faire face à ce qu'il se passe 
Il voudrait chercher à connaître la vérité 
Il faudra faire face s'il retrouve sa trace 

Il a donc décidé de rechercher 
Celui qui lui donna la vie 
Même si il risque de regretter 
Ça compte énormément pour lui 
De comprendre pourquoi il ne ressemblait à personne 
Pouvoir échanger juste quelques mots 
Et connaître cet homme 

Il l'a donc retrouvé 
Ils se sont rencontrés 
Il l'a donc retrouvé 
Ils se sont rencontrés 

Il a découvert que son vrai père 
Ne voulait vraiment pas de lui 
Et qu'il a même su faire une jolie petite famille 
Sans lui

I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Like a child you whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel a power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem

This is a story from my lifes
See I wouldn't want to lie
Getting on by with my lullaby
And all a my friends getting high
Mens holler holler hi all the time
But I can't find no man to love me

Sometimes I get up I'm down
I feel deadened hurt headed I'm down so I sweat it
Through my day this ain't the way chained to the desk
Mess hurt wrists phone fits and post-its
I heard it gonna change but see you in it hard to see
The final minute when
The world is yours all yours
I'll get it I mean it
And in the evenin, I'm alone
Not by the phone but I'm alone yo
Persevere all my fears try to weigh me down
Look around my ceilin's peelin rap deal you feelin I ain't now
Do it myself independent gotta try, no lie
Ain't No Limit kid no Majors
Gonna fuck me up right
I just want to sing a song about my life, my life

[Repeat Hook]

I'm sweet like nickel
Candy debutante on the street what in heat
Caught you haulin at me, mind stallin at me
Need you workin for me, need you talkin to me
Not something fuckin on me, what!
I'm patient like a doctor
Got the stock of proper genius hottest Venus
On top I'll stop your heart drop
Your jaw right to your pe-better heed this
Queen of Mt. Olympus can't resist the goddess honest
The kind you never
Always take home to your mamas
Accomplish what no other can treat you like no other man
Understand this mad mind body you ain't seen in a woman
My mommy possessed this passed this on
Dad made me strong played me mad songs growin up
Told me I be the one well I want the one
Levels deep and heart drum beat
boom beat boom beat
But complex properties of my mind keep em 10 steps behind
Ttakin mad time to find a guy it ain't right
Worthy of my lullaby it ain't right
Try to keep this shit inside it ain't right it ain't right
All night I can drive you wild
The sex the intellect get respect fuck the cheddar
Better bet
I'm the next to get mine find mine it's alright
But sometimes it hurts my mind

[Repeat Hook]

Word to God
I'll be the best girl you ever got, I'll keep it so hot
I'll just never stop
I got the plot locked, I got no guns cocked
And if you with me let me hear you say Nana
I'm sure that this is more than you can handle
This example
Coming from a girl placed high up on the mantle
Hold a candle to it, sick of the predicament
Tired of the bull thick headed
Need a sedative to get at it, well I invented it
My case in point I would anoint you my prince
Love you head toe to fingerprints
All benefits laugh and count all our kids,
make all our bids
Butterfly kiss with our lids
Let's make it come all to this
Gem at the precipice of the palace
Drink from my chalice
Never be jealous, no malice, I'll be your ballast
When winds blow on I'll stand strong
When winds blow on I'll stand strong",My Life

Like grassy knoll I shoot my mouth off take my top off on
Get my rocks off on Prada knockoff I'm gone
I cop rock on the dope block I'd rather rot than cop dope
I'd rather snot than snort coke I cope with Diet Coke
No pope no beau elope alone on the low
No dough but for those in the know, I'm famous you know? (No)

Sick of Kid Rock makin off on the chart while I'm caught makin art

I deserve the best and if you think my lyrics are incendiary
I'll go back to being an insipid secretary
Won't inspire no one, then the world will be safe

I also feel bad that Michael Angelo might have hurt his back
And what if there were no tracts for Shakespeare or wax
For Flash no road for Kerouac
There might not have been rap

Your man-freaked that, I told John- Get Back
Broke your 8Track A-Dats stole your Kit Kats
Grab your fanny pack and gagged you with a six pack a six White Castle sack
Drip wax in your office fax changed a few facts in your contract
Your advance is axed and A & are is gonna write all ya new tracks
I'm on the dole with mad loot sellin' bootlegs of poor artists
Got two legs to work but I beg for change to drink Bacardis
Hearty meals got these Hardy Boys hard then taught Nancy Drew and her dog
How to jerk off and how to steal from drug dealers
Ah enough of this I killed Snuffalufagus
With pills and made a snuff film
To prove to Big Bird he exists (See he is real!)
I'm ill can't deal with mere mortals
Got a portal in my knee to beam me
To a balance beam but I just drank 3 Jim Beams
My Olympic team is gonna scream at me, is it my turn? I gotta pee
I'm fourteen but haven't grown since I was three
Get my kicks feedin' drinks to kids in rehab clinks
Minx took Pink to my sink and used her hair die to die my minks
Tattoo inks with Ajax I highjacked Pat Sajak
Sent him back to Wheel of Fortune with a bad limp and a crack habit

I just upchucked my pills and Tom Collins

I'm just givin' what this track's bringin'

So I popped that kid and stole his bubble
Stuck him in some double Tupperware
A clean death inject ya with Crest and crystal meth
Obsessed with my own breasts
Won't look at you so don't get undressed for sex
I guess I'm on a rampage for underage idols
Did Malcolm's bro in the middle and little Kenny with subtitles
I strike quick like the emperor not the right temperature and

Get girls in bonnets hot like Harry Connicks
Sick on gin and tonics we super sonic hook you on our phonics
Learned Ebonics by erotic ebony dick and Mantronix
Never stoppin' it sock electronic shit
Allotted the whole club up when we spotted it
And if we wanted it fill it with men and spawn and shit
Ain't nothing wrong with it lets get the party started
Shit let's get it on and hit
High ballin' cat callin' no alcohol yo we all suck on a straw
A certain Je ne sais quoi at the bar
I hit it raw never do look back unless we like what we saw
Never do look back OK papa?
On the case like Steve Case estates like Oprah's place
Savoir faire and grace every hair in place
Here's a taste no time to waste
Do my makeup in the mirror while I sit up on your face
We paid great and when we don't got dates
Dig in the crates eat steak and masturbate
Spin wax make tracks we laid laid back
Ladies get laid and stay up late at that
Now we getting critical mass sass pinnacle
Like the citadel not minimal we hospitable
Mad kissable it's difficult aristicral princess
For instance we invincible never divisible make you invisible
Kit in each car Kittens with Kit Kat bars
Kickin' etiquette from Connecticut to Zanzibar
Strip malls to big balls 'n concert halls
New York Dolls taggin' up bathroom stalls
We All-Stars make folly North down to Raleigh
Follow me suck lollys down in Bali
All enthralled dollies arty as Dali
And when Mr. Rodgers calls me
We allowed on his trolley",We Got Panache
Princess Superstar,"I'm the chick who drops sick flows fill bowls
with ill flows ill ho hell knows pantyhose holes full of No Doz
Make your earholes shit pop six Pep Bysmol
sick abysmal bitch suckin dildos instead of dicks for kicks
No time for fake bitches, just sip some orange juice with my real bitches
And I just got three wishes I ain't askin for world peace
I want Range Rovers in three different colors
Genie gimme the damn keys!
Dead wrong like a Dead sticker on a bong bombs
runnin arms and rayguns with Ron Reagan to Vietnam and Iran
I'm blonde and dumb, I just taped over your demo with my song
Gagged sisqo with his thong
I ain't kiddin I'm filled with lil pills of Ritalin
riddle middle men to rob Bailey and Biddle again tell a friend
I use men like Mennen in my armpit I'm bad I can't stop it
Evil twin count as two in your caucus
Tell Murdoch lemme in his office
I'm a steal the carpet then Fox and then Rawkus
Voted for Dukakis, and I like Secaucus
'cause they got the word cock in it

Welcome to my world, such a nice nice girl, welcome to my world
Of course I'm getting lost ran into Kate Moss
Fed her a nine course full of chopped horse and forced her to toss

10 times divorced I speak in Morse
dot dot dash dot dash (HuH?) I just told you had an ugly ass!
Type rash unabashed crass with a brain rash
strapped for cash take me to your trailer I'll steal your trash
Ask me a question, I love to lie
hey look girl is that Jimi Hendrix?
'Scuse me while I kiss your guy
Everyone tells me I'm the female Eminem
well all I'm gonna talk about is getting fucked up the ass then
Don't be mad Em I'm just playin
I wish I had a Dr. Dre and sold out shows one million white faces in Dayton
Ritzes stead of Days Inn bitches for maids then
2 scoops of raisins amazin lays by names like Casey Kasem
Lazin by the pool with record industry fools
Crystal in my drool, man that'd be cool
I'm like Whoa

Let me answer the question of the day
I was born in Spanish Harlem then moved to PA
On 172 and St. Nich. Food stamps and WIC
'til my folks worked themselves rich (this track's making me sick)
If you want to compare me like white Lil' Kim female cool Keith
I'm speak and keep it simple
here's your brain on Princess Superstar pretty mental:
Ok-- I'm the Black Shirley Temple
Iced out like Entenmanns iced pens and diamond engines and denims
Got 10 Yemins countin Benjamins with Lettermans
Killin Pac mens like Inky and Binky
When ya stick your finger in me
it'll be sticky come out with a diamond ring on your pinky
Work six different angles, nicer tits than all the Bangles
Got Kangols singin Star Spangles - Oh Say Can You See
I'm better lookin than the flag you can sing that shit to me
(I'm gonna get in big trouble Louise!)
I'm taking a stance spend my big advance on a 500 man lap dance
Put ants in Bagger Vance's baggy pants sir come dance it's just my circumstance
I want to watch him do the Safety Dance, I'd do it myself but I can't
Or I'll just give my dough to my new label for nice dinners and liquor
I'm playin but, um next year that advance needs to be bigger",Welcome to My World
Princess Superstar,"[Intro Rap]
Pray I yell fore before I play
Before I foray let me explain, all day all ways
Foreplay? Hmmm...
I can make your cock go higher than the hair on Kid 'n Play
How I'm gonna feel when ya next to me

[Hook]
I'm feelin wet wet wet
In the club thinkin bout you all sweatin me
I'm feelin wet wet wet
You rock the decks like sex on some ecstasy
I'm feelin wet wet wet
Come on baby baby just get wet with me
I'm feelin wet--I'm all wet

[Verse]
On the high horse with a pot of hot sauce
Gotta keep floss yeah of course
Super high gloss gold gold on the cars
You say you want to toss baby damn I can't talk
Scorch Hibachi and I'm raunchy
Wet like sake damn foxy
Nasty Girl watch me
I'm getting on my knees you keep watchin hockey
And baby let me give it to ya
Baby grab my ass gonna do the nast nast
Get your filofax-hollaback
Baby don't ask write in this task right in the sack
You're fuckin me from Monday until Sunday
Oh! Here's your EZ Pass
Wet in the pool, wet in the shower
Wet in the elevator, Trump Tower or my lunch hour
Stiff like a broomstick Zoom
I think you need to take me in the bathroom quick ooh
Look and you can have it
Eatin out? This pussy got 4 stars in Zagat attack it
I'm a cunning linguist twist words round my tongue
And I ain't gonna rhyme the next one
You do it after I'm done",Wet! Wet! Wet!
Princess Superstar,"[Verse One]
I'm the flyest MC the finest MC
The nicest MC oh that's boring see, there's another MPC
So why you think most hip-hop sounds the same except for me?
Cryptic kick shit from the crypt
Sadistic lick hits with wit I'm quick
Rip crickets in a wicket I'm plain wicked
Thick in the rig wearing kid lipstick
I wreck shit on the next shit
Spit it in ya ear bit like a Q-Tip
Big silly bitch wickedy witch lickety split
in a sitch no dick but talk big carry a big stick
So I'm a girl, yeah I'm white
And I write all night with a bare swingin light
On the computer alright a producer alright
I produced this song
So you know who you are you know you were wrong
No I was not in that porn ""On Golden Blonde""
Got it goin on more James Bond than Sean John
Conned James Cahn for a ticket to Cannes
And I Love Ferris Bueller like tchhickachickkaa

[Whispered Hook Repeat 2x]
Please don't ask me who writes my lyrics
I'll spit up in your face much faster than you could hear it

[Verse Two]
Don't ask me who writes my lyrics
Damn ya you're enamored I'm a slam ya
Hotter than your can down in Alabama
Where's my camera I need a Kodak moment
of the moment I made you feel like Hammer
Son of Sam? I'm the daughter of Sam
Slaughter a man on the microphone
Pardon me ma'am was that part of a man
or your son I just whipped on the mic and sent home
Big quick shit New York- Stockholm
Kike and a Wop Wipin a cock
Walkin the block drop ya jaw to jock to your sock
I get that a lot yeah stop take stock
Shhh let me show you what I got
Made up my mind- like made it up I imagined it
I don't got a mind I abandoned it in a cabinet
So I could be a candidate for writin a few hits
walkin a few pits and cashin in on that shit
I put out my first tape in '94 if you got one, I'll buy it
I don't got one no more it was called Mitch Better get my Bunny
That shit was shitty but funny
I admit it was dumb but I did it with no money
In 9-5 my first CD called Strictly Platinum
but it didn't go Platinum it went back to them
And instead of waitin for someone to put me on
I started a label ran it 'til the money was gone
Then came along, then was gone
Money money money, don't try to make it with your songs
But like Salt 'n Pepa in El Segundo we push it along (Push it!)
And then Fat Beats wouldn't take my last LP
So I got egg beaters threw em back at the backpacks on 6th Ave. passin me
At the Bagel Buffet planted a bomb next to Grays
And when the records rained I sold 'em back for double to Fat Beats in LA
It's all OK 'cause when Fat Beats still wouldn't distribute my record
I renamed it-Pharaoh Monch featuring Chubby Checker
Ha ha mic wrecker don't sleep, Princess Superstar - The shit is deep",Who Writes Your Lyrics
Princess Superstar,"Please don't mess with me I'll spit you out like you were Sunny D
Did you really think you could be mean baby? Listen this next part is key,
You play a lot of Nintendo, smoke Endo
As far as men go, when ya gonna hit a crescendo and throw Super Mario and Atari out the window?
Now, we have something in common-You're lactose intolerant I'm wack host intolerant
Stop talkin about smackin crack hoes you're in college apologies accepted
I might have left lyrical holes in your mind
You'll fill it later with Cable or Hot 97 or Taco-Bell-n applyin, you want to play? Fine
Play-doh, roll you through a machine until you come out in little strings
I'm obscene I really could eat like 5 Krispy Kremes
Like when they're hot-Like all my tracks are hot
I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot-Like all my tracks are
hot
Stop going on AOL chat to try to find friends, yeah everyone likes you because you said you
were tall, slim and
Liked Dre over Ren, Cage over Em, Rage over them, Bahamadia over Lil' Kim
I had no idea you been down with hip-hop since you were ten
You were out ya playpen rubbin Barbie all over Ken and marveling over your carving
Of Led Zeppelin in your desk in ya den
I'm hittin mad skins you got bad skin get rad skins for your MP3 player kid I'm a Real Player!
Hard like Slayer while you a dater with Darth Vader I'm famous-later-
I hang with both Ralph Nader and Roc Raida, OK?
I swear I'm super you play boring Solitaire on your computer combed over hair
Wear a boober shirt work at Hooters in your underwear look like Mr. Hooper I don't care
I was nice to you originally what I'm doin is gonna ruin you like Druid ruins hear the crowd
booin naturally
Actually this is a big 'ol waste of my time
I would rather be home playing with my parakeets than making up this stupid rhyme
I mean, I am a sensitive Pisces and I wouldn't want to make you start cryin-Yeah start cryin
You get mad at Napster when nobody's even heard of you
I did a search on your name and came up with 1 result-
It was your computer, you're a loser
Lame, your screen name pseudo hip-hop sounding lingo mixed up lowercase/capital letters
What you think this is Bingo? I got singles out already
People know my name in discerning circles from New York to LA
While you earn Colonels jerk pay spurt on dirty curtains in a big shirt singin Hip Hop Hooray
You're idle I'm an idol you're not entitled I got a title
Nobody trades your file chill child when I said I liked you I was just tired
Go occupy yourself for a while you're lost whatever just frick off, vile in denial just step off
Why you think I get deals from record labels you get deals from drug dealers
Unappealing insincere won't eat Happy Meals you spill bong water like tears filled with lost
fear
Do acid and beer and trip out on how your queer little beard looks so weird in the mirror man
Guitar noodlin and patchouli let me teach you Ital-go Fongule
When I was in high school I'd a thought you were so fuckin cool
Anyway as I was saying before my screen name is much better than yours, its' -----
What you think I would tell you so you can Instant Messenger me all day?
I don't think so I am very important and right now I am eating lunch
Go get signed to Ruffhouse go away, bid on Ebay for a stuffed Mickey Mouse in a mug,
A sticky handcuffed pic of buff Courtney Love, one of Prince's aborted doves, a Jackson glove,
A blow up Peter Max pillow of Love, a diamond rug, or somethin worth more than all that stuff:
A cup that Princess Superstar once drank out of",You Get Mad at Napster
Princess Superstar,"Its so easy
When everybody's tryin to please me
I was just leaving
Got important stuff to do
Like buy shoes and hate you
War is the perfect excuse
To do everything bad I ever wanted to do
Because nothin really matters when nothin really matters
To anyone that matters

C'mon get it out spit it out take it out of me
C'mon get it out suck it out take it outta me

Yeah you're real stoned now
High on power and cocaine
Even though nobody good took that since 1979
Fuck it, pass me a line
I meant a line for my song
Everything is wrong living in oblivion is really fun
Got a hole deep in my soul
Cliche
But hey hey...hey...hey

C'mon tear it out spit it out take it out of me
C'mon get it out tear it out take the artery

Time to reassess my mission
Wish I had religion
For some nice tunnel vision
Go ahead get that smile you get on your face when you get a taste
But just in case
Remember I can press erase
I got two friends to take care of me
Apathy and technology
I'm such a commodity
A musical comedy everyone wants a part of me

And then I had a dream where everyone on earth died except for me
I went to the mall , you know like that movie
And when I woke up and I looked at the newspaper
And I thought, is that all there is?
Is that all there is?

C'mon tear it out spit it out take it out of me
C'mon get it out suck it out take it all from me
C'mon tear it out spit it out take it out of me
C'mon get it out take the heart take the artery",Artery
Princess Superstar,"If you had a machine that could make you into anything you wanted to be, like anything, what would you be?

let's see
I want to be the queen no I want to be 19 wait no I wanna be that horrible thing I saw last night in my dream oh I know! I want to be a supermodel she's European
A lean sex fiend oh thank god I can finally fit in those dumb jeans
Poof then it was me
I was her
I waited for something fabulous to occur
Somethin/ marvelous and absurd
I waited there was nothing
But I was something
Gorgeous crazy wealth and I could always reach the top of the supermarket shelf
All of a sudden I was no longer the model or myself
I must have thought about being a stupid box of cereal up on that stupid shelf
Boring wondered whether I would wait forever
I guess I was a brand that wasn't adequately advertised on tv ever
But it got better
Apparently a parent and a child threw me in a cart
It was hard I was smothered covered by a world of pop tarts
And a part of the newspaper that scared me, I think it was the pop charts
And I wish I was a cereal that..that. wasn't so smart

do you want to step inside my machine?

we all got home and they put me in the fridge
Damn why didn't they keep their cereal out so I could at least see where they lived
But I could hear them and it seemed like they were happy
When the kid wasn't napping she was always laughing
I felt jumpy my bran was crackling
I was grabbed along with the milk put in a bowl
It was dark /a black hole / must have been the kid's mouth/ I don't know
And in I went
Down the throat past the tongue by her heart by her lungs
And I could see she might be dying young
So I tried to patch it up with an old piece of gum that was there
But the damage was done disease had won it wasn't fair
But I wasn't gonna be the one that lost her
I wasn't a doctor
And I wasn't
A name on the list of somebodys roster
Why bother
And by that time I was already out the other end
In the toilet with milk
You know my old friend from the fridge from way back when and then
We got sucked down into the pipes
What a crappy life
Machine that's really not right

do you want to step inside my machine?

I can't stand it I said machine why are we here?
And it paused and said 'to play video games and drink beer'
That's weird you're subversive I thought we had a deeper purpose underneath the surface why do so many of us feel worthless
The machine said don't ask me ask your magazines
People and teen and loads of shit people don't need I started to bleed
And said just make me into bandaid the size of a giant pancake
Wrap me around the whole world to heal the heartache
And if anyone's hungry well
They could just eat me or I'll be a peace treaty and no one could ever defeat me
It said chill out girl remember being on the shelf
I seem to remember you kind of just / wanted to be yourself
No. I wanted someone to pick me, to love me, to be the greatest brand
I don't understand I was just trying to comprehend man
Oh you wanted the grand scheme the big plan the answer aha well here it is -

and then it turned off and that was it
Because you see the machine
Never really did exist

do you want to step inside my machine?

would you be a doctor
Would you be a rocker
Would you be a parka keepin someone warm in a lock up
Would you be a marker
That signed the constitution would you start a revolution or just play some pro soccer
How about a stalker
If you were a father
Would you be good at all or would you even bother
Be a beautiful girl or someone that could call her
Would you be a good talker
Stealth bomber
What about osama
Just to see what it feels like
'cause we all love to live in drama

be a big movie star
Fancy ass houses big car
Doin lots of drugs fuckin up an break laws
Be a fat man plumbers butt hangin out the drawers
Would you fight for a cause
Chew on people like jaws
Instigate wars push the button
Would you be something
Or middle class average with
Ok marriage
1.3 baby carriage
2 cars garage

would you be president
Would you be American
Would you be be better than everyone else as a representative
Would you be a monkey
Would you feel lucky
Would you be a big dick always fucking
Would you be a pumpkin
Would it be your brain inside a vegetable
Or would you feel nothing

Would you manage or would you suffer
Would you be a lover
Be a fighter
Or would you just be alright
Could you just be alright

And if all this could come true
Would you be ready
Would I be ready if I was you?",My Machine

The minute I'm coming, I'm up and about
I want to tear your rhythm down
Your feet keep moving to the beat of the crowd
And I'd love to see you drown
I want to lick your skin, I want to suck it in
I want to tear your rhythm down

Empty bottles and broken shells
I'm gonna hold you till you drop
Moving, falling, slipping fast
Your silk and purring voice won't last
The pounding in my veins won't stop
I want to tear your rhythm down

Baby lies in bubbles
Floating on ice
Waiting for me to hold my breath
Looking for love and sudden death
Just let me wipe your sins off the face of the earth
I want to tear your rhythm down

Prinz Pi,"Ich komm' wie Jimi, geh' wie Kurt
Mit ei'm Knall so laut, dass ihn jeder hört
Altes Manowar-Shirt, die Jeans mit Loch
Chucks war'n weiß, sie sind grau, viel gerockt
Stets mit Andrew aus Illinois, Indie-Base
Stets mit meiner Entourage, Vinnie Chase
Blauer Stern der Jugend, Verrückte am Abhäng'
Unschuld bleibt sitzen auf der Rückbank des Mustang
Leb' die Raubkopie von dem Traum der Amis

Herz schlägt manisch sein' eigenen Beat
Viele gekriegt, viele verbraucht, eine geliebt

Eine geliebt eine geliebt
Eine geliebt eine geliebt
Eine geliebt eine geliebt (eine geliebt eine geliebt)

Du hast die hohen Schuhe an und trägst deine Tattoos
Um die Schultern und den Hals wie ein seidenes Tuch
Ich bin verliebt wie ein Junge mit dem Bauch und darunter
Weiß, unter deinem Kleid warten tausende Wunder
Meine Eltern ha'm gewarnt, meine Freunde geflucht
Doch die Schrift auf dei'm Rücken is' mein heiliges Buch
Ich bin das Wild in dem Scheinwerferlicht deines Blicks
Ich hab' den Glauben, doch mir fehlen die Beweise für dich
Die Nächte sind gegen Ende intensiver denn je
Zeit war nie so zäh wie warten drauf, dich wiederzusehen
Auf dem Boden von der Flasche liegt ein tieferer See
Als man glaubt, wenn man taucht, ist die Liebe zu sehen
Meine Sonnenbrille sitzt im Gesicht wie geklebt
Die Kompassnadel dreht weg vom richtigen Weg
Meine Beine, die sind müde von den Treppen der Frauen
Sie applaudieren immer noch für den lächelnden Clown

Und du bist, alles für mich, alles das, was mir Angst macht
Meine silberne Kugel, mein Kryptonit und mein Anthrax
Du bist das, was ich vom Schicksal verlangt hab
Die Patrone für mein' Kopf in der Kammer der Pumpgun

Und du bist, alles für mich, alles das, was mir Angst macht
Meine silberne Kugel, mein Kryptonit und mein Anthrax
Du bist, das, was ich vom Schicksal verlangt hab
Die Patrone für mein' Kopf in der Kammer der Pumpgun

Wenn der Whiskey mir nich' hilft, fahr' ich nachts ohne Licht
Durch die Vorstadt, auf der Suche nach dem, was du nicht bist
Die SMS, die ich will, hast du nie abgeschickt
Unter der Laterne wartet meine Seele auf dich
Deine Augen lügen nie, nur dein Mund is' ein Dieb
Der jeden Coup mit dei'm Lächeln und dei'm Kuss unterschrieb
In dei'm Bett bin ich sicher vor den Klippen der Welt
Meine Rebellion is' an dein' Lippen zerschellt
Du bist der Abspann vom Film und ich sitze noch da
Du bist besser als du glaubst, auch wenn du es nich' magst
Ich weiß, alle deine komischen Geschichten sind wahr
Der Tag hat gestimmt, es war nur nich' das richtige Jahr
Was du denkst oder fühlst, hast du niemals gesagt
Wir liegen auf der Decke und ich rieche dein Haar
Ich bin zuhause wo du bist, egal welches Hotel
Dein dunkler Zauber lenkt die Zeit, darum fließt sie so schnell

Und du bist, alles für mich, alles das, was mir Angst macht
Meine silberne Kugel, mein Kryptonit und mein Anthrax
Du bist das, was ich vom Schicksal verlangt hab
Die Patrone für mein' Kopf in der Kammer der Pumpgun

Und du bist, alles für mich, alles das, was mir Angst macht
Meine silberne Kugel, mein Kryptonit und mein Anthrax
Du bist, das, was ich vom Schicksal verlangt hab
Die Patrone für mein' Kopf in der Kammer der Pumpgun

Meine Finger erinnern jede Narbe von dir
Deine Augen lassen Dinge ihre Farbe verlieren
Du lehrst mich die Wunder, die die Welt mir verschwieg
Seit der Typ mit den Tafeln von dem Berg runter stieg
Die Bilder auf deiner Haut, sind die Karte zu dir
Auch wenn dein Bus nie kommen wird, ich warte noch hier
Melancholie ist die Lederjacke meines Vereins
Ich trag' sie, weil das Leder meine Zeilen beweist
Du bist das Logo meines Clubs, die Hymne der Guten
Die traurige, rauchige Stimme der Jugend
Der Sound der Nacht, Stille und Gebell von ei'm Hund
Besser Rebell ohne Grund als Rebell ohne Mund!

Und du bist, alles für mich, alles das, was mir Angst macht
Meine silberne Kugel, mein Kryptonit und mein Anthrax
Du bist das, was ich vom Schicksal verlangt hab

Prinz Pi,"Sie kommt am nächsten Morgen, sieht durch aus, riecht nach Rauch
Knickt auf ihren hohen Schuhen fast um, flucht, zieht sie aus
Frage sie, wo war sie, sie sagt, bei ihrer Freundin
Ich sag' zu ihr: ""Verarsch mich!"" Sie sagt: ""Du weißt gar nichts!""
Sagt: ""Na gut, war noch feiern mit paar Leuten, aber ey, da war nichts
Kenn den Typen halt auch von der Arbeit
SMS nicht bekommen, Akku war nicht geladen
Geh' kurz duschen, nerv mich nicht, muss jetz' schlafen""
Ich fang' an zu fragen, sie hat mir nix zu sagen
Geh' raus, geh' zur Arbeit, hab' Lust mich zu schlagen
Doch bin kein guter Boxer, bin nur scheißwütend
Auf diesen Scheißtypen, endet meist übel
Vor allem für mich selber, all dieser Mist mit Weibern
Warum steht auf meinem Dach kein Bitch-Ableiter?

Unter meiner Haut wimmelt es von Ameisen
Kann ich keiner trauen? Gibt es noch Wahrheiten?
Sie frisst mich auf, sie frisst mich auf

Heut' Mittag ihr Hundeblick, ja, die hat was zu bereu'n
Treff' mich jetzt mit 'ner Neuen, das wird sie nich' grad freu'n
Bin voll der Kindergartenspasti, seh die Fehler klar, doch mach sie
Ein verletzter Vollidiot macht irgend'ne Fick-Bekanntschaft aktiv
Mein Telefonbuch is' lang, doch diese Nächte länger
Die Gefühle werden nich' schwächer, nur weil ich sie verdrängt hab'
Und ich vermiss' sie schrecklich, vermisse wie sie riecht
Jede Nacht geht meine Hand von selbst dahin, wo sie sonst liegt
Und wenn wir telefonier'n, bin ich nich' nett, doch will das gar nich'
Ich bin sauer auf mich selber, weil sie nich' mehr in meinem Arm liegt

Prinz Pi,"Sie sagten, dass alles nur eine Reise sei, wo nur dann mal Pause ist
In den kurzen Momenten, wo du zuhause bist
Alte Straße, heile Welt, Nachbarn sterben langsam weg
Neue Kids rauchen den gleichen Mist in der Hand versteckt
Schaukel auf dem Spielplatz schwingt,
So wie sie damals schwang an dem Abend an
Dem einer am Bahnhof sprang
Vorstadtidylle für Eltern, Hölle für Kids
Jeden Abend nach der Tagesschau das völlige Nichts
Haben, immer nur rausgewollt, reingewollt in die Stadt
Den Rolling Stone kleingemacht, eingerollt, in ein Blatt
In der S-Bahn Füße lässig auf den Sitz gefläzt
Jeder von uns denkt das gleiche „Keiner, der mich versteht
Keiner, der ist wie ich“ junge Fäuste geballt
Polnische Pyros erleuchten den Wald

Heut' ist nicht unser Tag, hast du gesagt
Das war nicht unser Jahr, ha'm wir gedacht
Doch im Rückblick war's übergut, wunderbar
Ein Song spielte den ganzen Tag, hundertmal

Heut' ist nicht unser Tag, hast du gesagt
Das war nicht unser Jahr, ha'm wir gedacht
Doch im Rückblick war's übergut, wunderbar
Ein Song spielte den ganzen Tag, hundertmal und nervte nie

Immer die gleichen Wege, die Straßen in meiner Gegend
Lieder pfeifend, gegen ewig gleiche Steine treten
Wo nie die Zeit vergeht und Partys enttäuschen
Immer Kippe schnippend da sitzen, wo sich Bahnschienen kreuzen, ah
Mit sieben Mann im Ford, angesoffen in's Nachbardorf
Die Tanke dort, Abhangort, nippen alle am Faxe-Import
Einer pumpt da wieder Bass durch seine Proll-Boxen
Russenhocke, Kreis sitzen, Pflastersteine vollrotzen
Augen mit tiefen Rändern vom miesen Weed der Händler
Weil das einzige, was gleich bleibt, ist, dass sich nie was ändert
Wieder schlendern an den Läden vorbei
Verschwende deine Jugend, alles dreht sich im Kreis

Heut' ist nicht unser Tag, hast du gesagt
Das war nicht unser Jahr, ha'm wir gedacht
Doch im Rückblick war's übergut, wunderbar
Ein Song spielte den ganzen Tag, hundertmal

Heut' ist nicht unser Tag, hast du gesagt
Das war nicht unser Jahr, ha'm wir gedacht
Doch im Rückblick war's übergut, wunderbar
Ein Song spielte den ganzen Tag, hundertmal und nervte nie

Damals an unserer Bushaltestelle
Allein mit meinen Kumpels, Schmutz und Kälte
Was wurde aus „beste Freunde für immer?“
Sind dieselben Leute heute behindert?
Wir waren mal hier, beweist die Wand
Wir haben uns mal auswendig gekannt
Wir haben den gleichen Ort im Kopf
Damals noch Kopf voll Wodka Gorbatschow
Hinter der Bude, wo wir hockten in den Sommernächten
Finger pulten Etiketten nach und nach vom Hals des Becks
Wenn die letzte Kippe wie ein einäugiger Wolf verglomm
Und unser Leben mit unseren Lieblingssongs verschwomm'
Die wir sangen bei Tag und schrien bei Nacht
Waren wir schwach, drehten wir laut und liehen uns Macht
Asche am Polo voll, CD hakt, weil verkratzt
Wolke 7, siebte Hölle, alles in einer Nacht
Waren Könige, nur mit Schnaps und Chio Chips
Was unsere Augen sahen, war größer als die Videoclips
Und die ersten Küsse sind doch noch die ehrlichsten
Jedes Mixtape, das wir machten, war unser Lebenssinn

Heut' ist nicht unser Tag, hast du gesagt
Das war nicht unser Jahr, ha'm wir gedacht
Doch im Rückblick war's übergut, wunderbar
Ein Song spielte den ganzen Tag, hundertmal

Heut' ist nicht unser Tag, hast du gesagt

Prinz Pi,"Morgens auf dem Schulweg schon, nahmen wir die gleiche Bahn, 
Gleicher Stundenplan, gleicher Tag, gleicher Song, 
Sponnen uns unseren Plan, wo sind die verschwundenen Namen', 
Die wir all den Dingen gaben, lang bevor die Wunden kamen,
Hassten die gleichen Lehrer, schwärmten für die selben Weiber, 
Ich hör' Rap noch heut', doch damals war er 10 mal geiler.
Teilten uns Minipizza, später dann die Wunschkippen, 
Starter Caps, schwarze Tags, auf Parkbänken rumsitzen, 
Zäune war'n zum Rüberklettern, 
Jeder Tag Abenteuer, Boot stehlen, 
Notraketen in die Nacht über der Havel feuern, 
Nichts wärmte mehr, als die unerlaubten Lagerfeuer, 
Als jede Story nagelneu war, und nicht wiedererzählt, 
Und wiedererzählt, und in der Erinnerung wiedererlebt.
Oder wie hier, von mir, konserviert in Lieder gelegt,
Wie man's auch wendet und dreht, der gerade, bleibt der schwierigste Weg.

Alle Welt will den Neubeginn, 
Doch ich will nur, dass der alte Wagen weiterläuft, 
Wo sind all die Freunde hin,
Auf den Fotos lachen wir für immer, und niemand kann uns nehmen, 
Was schon lange nicht mehr da ist.

Alle Welt will den Neubeginn, 
Doch ich will nur, dass der alte Wagen weiterläuft, 
Wo sind all die Freunde hin,
Auf den Fotos lachen wir für immer, und niemand kann uns nehmen, 
Was schon lange nicht mehr da ist.

Wie sich halt immer die Wege trennen, nur unsere nicht, dachte ich,
Bis dann der nächste aus der Rufliste verschwunden ist,
Guck durch mein Telefonbuch, 
So viele Nummern die ich lange nicht mehr anrief, 
Und ich vermisse die Momente die wir teilten, 
Mein Gesicht hüllt sich in Dampf dann, wenn ich langsam, 
An der Kippe zieh', heb mein Glas, ich trink auf uns, 
Doch trink allein, 
Die eine alte Freundin die noch immer da ist hinkt herein.


Wo ging' all die Freunde hin, wir rufen an, 
Irgendwann, doch sehen uns bei Facebook am häufigsten,
Wo ging' all die Freunde hin, bis dann
Irgendwann, sagen wir und denken, dass wir nicht käuflich sind.
Doch das Leben kostet jedem dann am Ende doch sein Leben, 
Und besteht auch im Ganzen gesehen nur aus tausenden Details, 
Und in jedem, wirklich jedem, steckt bei Licht besehen, der Teufel drin.

Hab Freunde verloren an Weiber,
Freunde verloren ans Geld, 
Freunde verschwanden und wohnen am anderen Ende der Welt, 
Freunde verloren durch paar Freunde, die gar keine waren, 
Freunde verloren an den Suff und die kleinen weißen Bahnen, 
Freunde verloren an Zweisamkeit, an Eigenheim, an Frau und Kind
An den wesentlichen Sinn des Lebens an sich, 
Freunde verloren an ihre Chefs, an Ehrgeiz, an den neuen Porsche, 
Geld ist erste und ewige Pflicht.",Asoziale Kontakte
Prinz Pi,"Es fängt jedes mal an mit „Hast du Lust etwas zusammen zu machen?“
Und endet damit seine Sachen zusammen zu packen
Und einander zu hassen und die Liebe von gestern
Für alles Unglück von Heute verantwortlich zu machen
Wir verletzen Menschen, die uns lieben
Lieben Menschen, die uns verletzen
Meine Berufung ist das auszusprechen in Texten
Glaubten an große Gesten, hörten nur tote Wesen
'Nen Fick zu geben ist seeliger als die Kohle nehmen
Und sind wir hier gelandet
Ich wache auf nach Schiffsbruch
Ich bin bei dir gestrandet
Du bist mein kleines Eiland
Nur ich weiß wie die Insel heißt und wo sie liegt
Da auf der Indianerecke, da liegt meine Heimat
Du trägst meine alten Hemden, Löcher im Flanell
Und siehst darin heißer aus als all die Töchter von Chanel

Wo die Liebe hinfällt, stürzen auch wir
Alle Wunder sind uns wirklich passiert
Ich hab dich so geliebt, weil wir das Gleiche hassten

Eines Tages werd' ich sagen
Weißt du noch unsere Zukunft
Die wir uns nach 10 Bechern Whiskey malten
Vom wilden großen Garten, von unseren Kindern sprachen
Völlig selbstständig die gleichen Bilder raten
Von irgendwo kommt leise und heiser Jimi Hendrix
Du sagst Angst vor Bindung, ich sage Independent
Wir verstehen uns blind und das müssen wir
Weil es immer dunkel ist, wenn wir uns sehen, küssen wir

Wo die Liebe hinfällt, stürzen auch wir
Alle Wunder sind uns wirklich passiert
Ich hab dich so geliebt, weil wir das Gleiche hassten
Lass gehen, wo wir noch groß sind
Lass uns nicht kleiner machen

Wir sterben gemächlich, merken es beide doch auch
Feuer ist lange schon aus, Wohnung riecht nach kaltem Rauch
Sagen, wir müssen raus, fahren weg, doch laden nicht auf
Reicht fürs Weitermachen grade so aus
Die Macht der Gewohnheit
Wir wollen nicht enden als Senioren im Wohnheim
Die sich mehr Dulden als lieben
Die Schuld für ein lahmes leben gegenseitig auf sich schieben
Du hältst deine Zigarette wie diesen sprichwörtlichen Strohhalm
Jetzt sitz' ich wieder rum in irgendeinem Backstageraum
Kalt, verraucht irgendwann war er weg der Traum
Alt, verbraucht, beschmiert mit all den schwarzen Eddings
Die Wände leisten mir Gesellschaft, ich höre sie sprechen
Paar hundert Kilometer Autobahn und Regen liegen
Zwischen mir hier und dir und unseren Lebenslügen
Wir klammern uns an unsere ersten Treffen
Zehren von den Bildern hinter denen wir die Wirklichkeit verstecken

Wo die Liebe hinfällt, stürzen auch wir
Alle Wunder sind uns wirklich passiert
Ich hab dich so geliebt, weil wir das Gleiche hassten
Lass gehen, wo wir noch groß sind
Lass uns nicht kleiner machen","Ende Blut, Alles Blut"
Prinz Pi,"Sonnenlicht scheuert an Holzstühlen
Drei Wochen noch bis zu den Zeugnissen
Und noch wurden aus uns nicht die großen Arschlöcher und Teuflinnen
Die wir heut' sind
In den Sommerferien geht es endlich los
Zeit und Freiheit grenzenlos
Es beginnt bestimmt, nach dem Sprung vom Dreier
Dem ersten Wu Tang-Songtext runterleiern
Dem ersten Mal was klauen, dem ersten Kuss mit Zunge
Der ersten Schlägerei, dem ersten Zug auf Lunge
Dem ersten Mal ihren Busen sehen
Nachts auf dem Dach rauchend, beginnen alles zu verstehen
Dem ersten Mal auf Demo gehen, Harten machen, Stein schmeißen
Wegrennen, Herz schlägt bis zum Hals einscheißen
Dem ersten Konzert, teil sein eines Lifestyles
Schwitzen, tanzen, dabei sein, Freiheit!

Ich warte, dass mein Leben beginnt
Und ich weiß, was ich will und ich weiß, wer ich bin
Bald nicht mehr Fähnchen im Wind
Lauf schon so lang, nur weiß nicht wohin

Ich warte, dass mein Leben beginnt
Und ich weiß, was ich will und ich weiß, wer ich bin
Bald nicht mehr Fähnchen im Wind
Lauf schon so lang, nur weiß nicht wohin

Nach roten Lippen, nach großen Klippen
Nach Gauloises Kippen schmeckt der Kuss der Freiheit
Nach Kiffen schmeckt der Kuss der Freiheit
Mama, ich muss los, muss dabei sein
Es beginnt, auf der Abifahrt, ab nach Prag
Im Bus Wodka Bull, egal, was der Lappen sagt
Nach der ersten Dieseljeans,
Nach dem ersten graumelierten Apparel-Hoodie, sicher nach dem Zivildienst
Nach dem ersten Streit, wo Mama sagt „Pack dein Zeug!”
Nach dem ersten Mal, wo dich dein bester Freund krass enttäuscht
Weil er die Frau, die du liebst, küsst
Nachdem du dein Zuhause mit dem Waschmittel aus der Jeans schwitzt
Und du lernst diese unheile Welt kenn'
Von Zuhause komplett bis zum Melt renn'
Nicht mal sich selbst kennen, werde ein Felsen
Mit Nathalie Portmans Zwilling im Zelt penn'
Nach der ersten großen Liebe, die gescheitert ist
Nach der zweiten Woche, wo der Regen weiterpisst
Nach der Diplomarbeit, nachdem der erste Lohn beweist
Dass es diesmal fast bis zum nächsten Monat reicht

Ich warte, dass mein Leben beginnt
Und ich weiß, was ich will und ich weiß, wer ich bin
Bald nicht mehr Fähnchen im Wind
Lauf schon so lang, nur weiß nicht wohin

Ich warte, dass mein Leben beginnt
Und ich weiß, was ich will und ich weiß, wer ich bin
Bald nicht mehr Fähnchen im Wind
Lauf schon so lang, nur weiß nicht wohin

Hat nie richtig angefangen, immer nur irgendwann
Nach dem Nächsten dann, wann fängt's mal wirklich an?
Bin nie angekommen, nur einmal angenommen
Dass nix mehr andres kommt,
Dann war's das schon

Haufen Frauen? Dann Job und Haus, mal schauen
Es hieß „Leb dein' Traum“ Und ich träume noch
Auch heute noch, mach meinen Pseudojob

Hatte nach nur zwei Stunden meine Heimat satt
Zwei alte Lehrer kamen, vier Leute aus der alten Klasse
Auf seinem Jugendzimmerboden lag die kalte Waffe
Als ihn sein Vater fand, auf einer Karte stand
„ich bin zurückgegangen“
Ein anderer hatte gerade seinen ersten Tag im Außendienst
Als sie ihn abends aus dem Wrack von seinem Audi ziehen
Noch einen Monat lebte er weiter auf Bildern
Bis seine Pinnwand, letztendlich still war, das Pärchen seit der Zehnten
Von dem alle sagten
„die werden heiraten“
Sind seit zwei Tagen Status, es ist kompliziert
Und es wird komplizierter

Wir jammern gern, so sind wir Deutschen
Hab gestern ein' wieder getroffen mit ihm paar Biere gesoffen
Den ganzen Abend hat er durch meine Miene gesprochen
In den Spiegel hinter mir, er ist jetzt sehr erfolgreich
Redet von teuren Uhren, hohen Steuern und dem Goldpreis
Wie er stetig steigt und über viele Frauen
Die ihn alle wollen und er selber will immer
Über den Aufsichtsrat, sein neues teures Auto
Nach dem vierten Bier wird er für mich lautlos,
Und ich schrei' „Was hast du schon erreicht?“
Du bist nur der größte Hai in deinem kleinen Teich
Doch es kommt stets ein größerer, besserer, stärkerer, cleverer, Hai
Sei ein Mensch und kein Hai, Mensch!
Zwischen den Beinen von den Sekretärinnen
Findest du keinen Lebenssinn, verlierst nur deinen Ehering

Prinz Pi,"Du bist die pure Unvernunft, wohnst in Villa Kunterbunt
Du warst mal gutes Mädchen, ich war mal Untergrund
Du warst mal Königin von Kreuzberg in deinem blauen Kleid
Mit Omas alter Perlenkette und den grauen Nikes
Wir saßen in der Schwärze, starrten ins Licht
Stundenlang Untergang, sprachen von nichts
Schweigen ist Gold, unsere Küsse waren Platin
Ich hab all die Jahre nur gewartet auf dich!
Aber warum sagst du „Pause“, wenn du „Schluss“ meinst?
Ich dachte, du wärst meine lebenslange „Plus Eins“
Warum rede Ich von Heirat, du von Freiheit
Als wären das zwei unvereinbare Lifestyles?

Nur da sitzen, zusehen wie das Licht verläuft
Wir projizieren uns auf die anderen, Litfasssäulen

Kein Scharfschütze schoss dem Wachhund Blei in seine Brust
Kein Fauchen eines Kampfjets knallte übers Land
Kein Soldat ging links, rechtsum, und stand dann stramm

Kein weißer Blitz aus Tod
Kein Präsident im tiefsten Bunker tippte seinen Code
Kein Kampfgas tränkt die Luft mit Tod
Kein Mann gegen Mann
Kein David gegen Goliath kämpft solang er kann
Kein General gab grünes Licht, für die große Schlacht
Kein Feigling am Computer schob die Drohne durch die Nacht

Und baut auch unsere deutschen Autos hinterm Sonnenaufgang

Kann nicht singen, nur lallen
Kann nicht schleimen, kann nicht lügen

Kein Monster mehr, das aus dem Nebel steigt
Mehr Monster werden komm',

Zehn Zentimeter über mein Herz sticht
Schmerzt mehr, als ich dachte,
Doch niemals genug, um zu zeigen, wie sehr es mir ernst ist
Bis dein Name auf meiner Brust fliegt
Narben beweisen nicht Schwäche
Sondern nur, dass uns keiner kaputt kriegt
Dass uns so schnell niemand mehr klein macht
Mit dir ist es endlich, unendlich einfach
Erst teilen wir Kippen, dann teilen wir Lippen
Wir schreiben unsere eigenen Hymnen
Wissen, dass unser Leben ein Kinofilm ist
Zwei Stars ohne Make-Up im schmierigen Licht
Pedal auf das Blech, uns kriegen die nicht
Der alte Revolver fällt aus dem Bund
Ziel auf den Nordstern, Rebellen ohne Grund
Erst blitzt Licht aus dem Lauf, dann hallt Donner

Wir werden ihn niemand' verraten
Wenn alles zu viel wird, dann renn' wir hierhin
Um endlich wieder zu atmen das Braun, deine Haare,
Das Braun, deine Augen werd' ich nie
Gegen ein anderes tauschen
Was du sagst, mildert das Rauschen von draußen
Und sind wir umstellt
Von unserem Scheitern, dann bauen wir auf Räuber-Art Leitern
Das Leder der Jacke schon rissig und alt
Der Kragen, der schützt gegen Stiche am Hals
Wird das Feuer mit der Finsternis kalt
Und stirbt von gelb zu rot zu schwarz
Dann auf die Toten in die Glut ein Glas
Neun Teufel und ein Engel raufen in mir
Lerne zu glauben mit dir, brauch' kein Foto, mein Schatz,
Denn du bist auf den Lidern der Augen von mir in die Haut tätowiert

Leuchtet grün „Exit“ in dunkelster Nacht

Prinz Pi,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",21:04/Schwarzer Lack

Konto im Minus, weiter ziellos, noch eine geraucht
Kein Auto, keine Wohnung, grade Tochter geboren
Mein Album floppt, hab’ fast alles in ei’m Monat verloren
Kohle reicht grade so für ein kleines Büro
Veschanz’ mich hinterm Mac, ganz allein und bedroht
Gehe weg, bisschen raus, ende weinend im Klo
Denk’ an dich, fühl’ mich weit unter deinem Niveau
Und dann treffen wir uns unter einem scheinenden Mond
Alles passt und ich gewinne meine Million

Die mit Herzen meinen Tourbus bemalen
Und in nur einem Jahr immer Krach und Streit
Doch ich liebe jede Nacht zu zweit
Durch die Scheibe in der Koje fällt das erste Licht
Und in mei’m Kopf ist nur dein Gesicht
Weil ich weiß alles wird besser werden mit dir
Und wir kaufen einen Hund, denn der pennt neben dir
Auf der Couch, doch ist da, dann, wenn ich’s nicht bin
Weil mir meine Songs verdammt wichtig sind
Bin ich Tag und Nacht weg, Kopf fällt in Krisen
Würde mich dann am liebsten doch selbst erschießen

Und die schlimmsten Sachen hört man nicht auf Platten

Hab’ noch Umwege vor mir, Fehler dabei
Doch ich weiß, dass du jeden verzeihst
Wir brechen seit dem Anfang schon die Regeln der Zeit
Seit unser'm ersten Regen im Mai
Wir brechen seit dem Anfang schon die Regeln der Zeit

Prinz Pi,"Du warst das Wunschkind, Hans im Glück
Die jungen Eltern nach dir ganz verrückt, wie wurdest du zu dir?
Deine Haare waren immer kurz, Schnitt wie die G.I.s
Deine Augen waren wie meine zwei Kreise blaues Eis
Dahinter mehr Eis und dahinter Ehrgeiz
Und ein Geist, der in einem eiskalten Meer treibt
Deine Kinder sitzen am Tisch, wo du nie saßt
Kauen lange auf jedem kleinen Wort, das du sprachst
Familienfeiern immer ein durchlöcherter Kreis
Auf dem großen Herd köchelt das Fleisch
And're Hände holen das Laub aus dem Pool
Vier mal pro Sekunde tickt laut deine Uhr

Böser Mann, böser Mann, böser Mann, böser Mann
Alles, was du anfasst, machst du krank
Böser Mann, böser Mann, böser Mann, böser Mann
Endlich bist du tot, böser Mann

Jeder Anzug auf Maß, dunkelblau oder schwarz
Die Uhr gold und man sieht selten die Haut an dei’m Arm
Telefone schlagen dumpf durch den Nebel Alarm
Kleine Flaschen ebnen den Tag
Autos immer Stern, Restaurants immer Stern
Gehst und kommst, als wenn wir Hotelzimmer wären
Deine Freunde sind Verbrecher, die nettesten, die saßen
Die schlimmsten von ihn’ auch in den Chefetagen
Lasst ihn in Ruhe, wenn er kaputt auf dem Sofa liegt
Frag nicht, was das ist,  Nutten und Kokain!
Atem immer schlecht, doch Rasur wie geleckt
Karte Gold, und die Uhr läuft perfekt

Böser Mann, böser Mann, böser Mann, böser Mann
Alles, was du anfasst, machst du krank
Böser Mann, böser Mann, böser Mann, böser Mann
Endlich bist du tot, böser Mann

Du wolltest Einsamkeit, denn die kanntest du per Du
Alles auf der Welt bereist, stets allein gebucht
Dein letzter Freund ist die Leere auf den Autobahn’
Tankstellen und Golfplätzen, wir lassen deinen Namen in Gold setzen
Deine Asche wie du wolltest auf ein’ Haufen gekippt
Sollten jeder ein, zwei rauchen auf dich
Und wenn die Asche eins wird mit der Asche von dir
Bricht Licht durch die braunfarbene Flasche vom Bier
Und wenn der Wind dann die Asche zerstreut
Bist du für immer fort und du hattest kein’ Freund
Wolltest, dass der King für dich singt und der King sang
Dreimal Blue Suede Shoes, also bis dann!

Böser Mann, böser Mann, böser Mann, böser Mann
Alles, was du anfasst, machst du krank
Böser Mann, böser Mann, böser Mann, böser Mann
Endlich bist du tot, böser Mann

Prinz Pi,"Die meisten, die du triffst, werden lügen, mein Schatz
Menschen können das nicht von selber, darum üben die das
Wir sagen das, was man von uns hören will
Ich geb’ dir mal ein Beispiel von ei’m typischen Satz
In guten wie in schlechten Zeiten und so weiter im Gelöbnis
Weil wir wünschen, dass die besten Seiten uns bestimmen
In den Schatten lauert das, was man nicht gerne zeigt
Doch wohin es ohne Beobachtung wie von selber treibt
Rein in dunkle Ecken, wir schlüpfen unter Decken
Kehren zurück mit breitem Lächeln, hinter dem wir uns verstecken
Spielen uns selbst was vor und gleich für alle ander'n mit
Denn ohne Hoffnung auf das Gute, bleibt das blanke Nichts

Auch wenn fast alles gelogen ist, eines ist wahr
Nicht für einen Tag, nicht für ein Jahr
Für immer und immer bin ich für dich da

Auch wenn fast alles gelogen ist, eines ist wahr
Nicht für einen Tag, nicht für ein Jahr
Für immer und immer bin ich für dich da

Die meisten, die du triffst, werden lügen, mein Schatz
Menschen können das nicht von selbst, darum üben wir das
Sieh, diese Frau, wie sie lacht, alles glatt, alles straff
Die Jahre haben scheinbar kaum an ihrer Physis gekratzt
Doch bei ihr haben sie alles gemacht konserviert
Ihre Jugend für Jahrzehnte gestreckt
Was die Natur nicht selbst schafft, macht das Skalpell
Jedes Teil bis ins letzte Detail ist perfekt
Nur im Innern ist das Chaos noch viel größer, die Schnitte
Die keiner sieht, ziehen sich durch die Mitte
Die Oberfläche ist perfekt, doch dahinter gerissen
Kein Mensch kennt die Füllung vom Kissen

Auch wenn fast alles gelogen ist, eines ist wahr
Nicht für einen Tag, nicht für ein Jahr
Für immer und immer bin ich für dich da

Auch wenn fast alles gelogen ist, eines ist wahr
Nicht für einen Tag, nicht für ein Jahr
Für immer und immer bin ich für dich da

Eines ist klar
Wenn man’s nur jeden Tag selbst zu sich sagt
Dann wird jede Lüge irgendwann wahr

Auch wenn fast alles gelogen ist, halt, weil wir müssen
Wen wir sehen, wohin wir gehen, wen wir küssen
Kein Mensch kennt die Füllung vom Kissen

Die meisten, die du triffst, werden lügen, mein Schatz
Menschen können das nicht von selbst, darum üben wir das
Aber wenn wir einfach ehrlich sind, dann fühlen wir uns nackt
Ohne elegantes Make-Up aus Lügen ertappt
Wie viele Fehler hab’ ich früher gemacht? 
Wie viel werd’ ich noch begehen in der Kühle der Nacht?
Mit dem Alter wurde auch aus mir das übliche Wrack
Illusionen sind Drogen, für unsre Psyche gemacht
Die letzte und die schönste Lüge ist das, was danach kommt
Nachdem zum letzten Mal der Arzt kommt
Und diese Lüge lässt sich niemand nehmen, dafür muss sich niemand schämen
Denn es ist der Glaube, dass wir uns wieder sehen",Die Füllung vom Kissen
Prinz Pi,"Alles was sie anfasst macht sie gleich kaputt
Mit jedem Schrei da entweicht der Druck 
Wir sind wir, dann wenn keiner guckt 
Wir sind nur wir, dann wenn keiner guckt
Am Anfang war die Maske nur gemalt
Deine Farben war´n die Waffen deiner Wahl
Gänsehaut am Arm, war´n noch nicht vernarbt
Und man meinte damals alles ganz genau wie man es sagt
Jede Nacht neigte ihren Kopf zum Tag
Und du hast jeden der da kam umarmt
Es war egal was irgendjemand dazu sagt
War doch egal was irgendjemand dazu sagt
Doch jeder Stich in die Mitte der vernarbt
Auch wenn du dir sagst, man ich mach das weil ichs mag
Wir wollten einfach Spaß und nur den Moment
Indem halt alles brennt und nichts mehr wichtig scheint
Was man bis dahin kennt
Wollten ihn permanent auskosten, rauskitzeln
Aus dem Sinus, kein Minus, Videos nur ausspitzen
Höhepunkte auf eine Kette gereiht
Nie gestoppt, alles top, richtig heftige Zeit
Doch wenn die Nacht dich verlässt
Ausspuckt, zurück auf die Matratze, dein Nest
Dann guckst du in den Spiegel
Komm wir machen den Test
Die Farben bleiben da
Deine Maske sitzt fest

Alles was ich anfass mach ich gleich kaputt
Die Hände leer, was bleibt ist leicht wie Luft
Wir wurden anders wie meine Hood
Wir wurden anders, ganz langsam, wie meine Hood
Binsenweisheit alles ändert sich
Und hat Einfluss natürlich und ändert dich
Mich und jeden, auch die Straßen hier
Die war´n mal dreckiger und geiler und nur wir waren hier
Nur wir waren hier in der Wärme der Nächte
Zusammen mit unser´n Werten, den echten
Die Häuser war´n nicht luxussaniert
Keine Eulen auf die Brust tätowiert
Und wenn man schrie, hallte der Schrei
Durch die Leere der Straßen
Und man spürte das Echo
Und spürte sich selbst in den kurzen Momenten
In der Stille beim atmen
Und heut´ prallt es ab im Gemurmel der Menschen
An Spätis und Buden, Cafes und an Ständen
Neue Geschäfte, die Bahn speit mehr Menschen
Die sich selbst begegnen bei uns in der Fremde
Jeder trägt ein Kostüm
Trägt jeden Tag hier im Jahr sein Kostüm
Dabei gibt es kein Karneval hier
Hier bei uns in Berlin

Früher da war alles besser
Denn jetzt wissen wir ja wie es aussah
Alles fest keine Gefahr droht im Rückblick
Die Bilder sind brauchbar
Im Jetzt ist das Chaos
Die Zukunft ist dunkel
Doch hinter uns alles am Funkeln
Doch hinter uns alles am Funkeln

Prinz Pi,"Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Like a child you whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Prinz Pi,"Bin neulich mal zurückgegangen im alten Klassenzimmer
Letzte Reihe, krasse Spinner, beste Zeiten, blass erinnert
Tische bekritzelt mit Pac und Fuck Rektor Skinner
Ist mir auch heut nicht peinlich, jede Zeile passt für immer
Würd’ ich tätowieren, Platz ist genug
Auch die dreckigsten Fluten von Blut, die waschen den Bug
Denk’ ich auf dem kalten Flur, zehn Jahre nach dem Abitur
Bin ich wieder der unbeliebte Junge mit der Kackfrisur

People around my age 
Had always been looking for something, I didn’t know what it was
And anything that was out of reality anything that would change 
The state of my mind
Seemed to be what I was really looking for
Only I never realized how mistaken I was

Da parken die SUVs, Leder riecht neu
Das brave Heer, atmet Teer, ich hab’ noch Federn für euch
Die meisten sind verheiratet, die wenigsten treu
Ich würd’s nicht geschenkt haben wollen, das Leben von euch
Wenn das Alter kommt, der Alltag sie frisst
Man lügt sich, weil’s bequem ist, ins Faltengesicht
Die allerbesten Weine die halten sich nicht
Und ich so: Klasse Sex, Flasche ex, nicht einmal abgesetzt
Atme nochmal durch, atme rasselnd durch
Die Tür geht auf, Augen geradeaus, ich mach’ die Sache kurz
Die eine Hälfte kaut weiter, die andre verstummt
Keine Krawatte, meine Platte, Rebell ohne Grund

Einer von denen, die meine Zeilen verstehen
Weil man ihr Leben lang vor ihnen stand, wie vor einem Problem
Manchmal komm’ ich nach Hause, um die Kleine zu sehen
Um in dem Spiegel ihrer Augen meine Eignen zu sehen
Doch meine Schuhe stehen halt da, um damit weiterzugehen
Und die Frau mit meinem Namen muss es leider verstehen
Bleib du mal besser da in deinem kleinen System
Aber wenn du alleine weinst, hat das keiner gesehen
Bleib mal da in deinem bequemen, heilen Leben

Weiß im Schlaf wo jeder Schalter und Knopf ist
Kenne meinen Jet wie ein Teil meines Körpers
Reagiere aus Reflex ohne den Umweg durch Wörter
Jedes System funktioniert, doppelt gecheckt
Und auch ich funktioniere wie ein Uhrwerk perfekt
Gib mir Koordinaten und ich drücke den Knopf
Und ich drücke ihn sooft, wie man mir sagt, dass ich drücken soll

She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

Alltag reißt ein Wochenende lang aus der festgefahrenen Halterung
Von sechzehn bis sechzig sind wir alle jung
Von vorne bis nach hinten erste Reihe und die Halle schrumpft
Kiffen und die großen Worte
Spreng’ den viel zu kleinen Innenraum von Thorstens dunkelrotem Opel Corsa
Tape mit Klinkenadapter erste The XX
Bass knackt, Abfuck sofort hundert Backflashs
Sitze sind so dreckig wie einst
Brauchst nix sagen, weiß genau, was du meinst
Fuhrst zu zweit los, große Reise, aber kamst heim allein
Brauchst nix sagen, weiß genau, was du meinst
Fahren wieder planlos umher
Rotzevoll, man, wir waren schon mal mehr
Irgendwo treiben eure Ringe jetzt mit den Walen im Meer
Wie das kam, kann man gar nicht erklären

Hinter jedem meiner Worte stehen Tage, die waren
Sind ein paar Tausend wohl an der Zahl
Sind noch paar Tage vor mir, was soll ich damit machen?
Die besten Sachen im Leben sind keine Sachen
Hinter jedem meiner Worte stehen Tage, die waren
Und was du so redest, ist mir egal
Sind noch paar Tage vor mir, was soll ich damit machen?
Die besten Sachen im Leben sind keine Sachen

Sitzen im Morgengrauen rauchend auf dem Autodach
Unten sitzt die große Stadt voll mit lautem Krach
Sitzen im Morgengrauen rauchend auf dem Autodach
Die laute Stadt hat sich grad kurz ausgemacht
Blicken lieber zurück in die Jugend aus Gold
Uns're Zukunft haben wir so nicht gewollt
Blicken immer lieber zurück in ein Gestern voll Glück
Denn hier und jetzt, da ist nix wie es soll
Meine Freunde raten Alter, mach aus deinen Strophen die Hooks
Mit bisschen Zucker wird die Pille von den Doofen geschluckt
Meine Freunde raten sag’s nicht so hochkompliziert
Doch ich verbieg’ mich nicht einen Millimeter ab hier

Hinter jedem meiner Worte stehen Tage, die waren
Sind ein paar Tausend wohl an der Zahl, uh huh
Hinter jedem meiner Worte stehen Tage, die waren
Und was du so redest, ist mir egal, warst nicht da

Hinter jedem meiner Worte stehen Tage, die waren
Sind ein paar Tausend wohl an der Zahl
Sind noch paar Tage vor mir, was soll ich damit machen?
Die besten Sachen im Leben sind keine Sachen
Hinter jedem meiner Worte stehen Tage, die waren
Und was du so redest, ist mir egal
Sind noch paar Tage vor mir, was soll ich damit machen?

Prinz Porno,"Jeder Boy in deiner Gang hält sich für individuell
Die haben ihre Casios aus Ironie bestellt
Du denkst ""Rappt der da im Hipster Hype?
Mit 'ner veganen Bionade auf seinem Fixie Bike? Irgendwas im Fitti Style?""
Doch weit gefehlt, am Anfang war das Wort
Am Ende deines Dasein stehe ich in einer Short
Rapper von denen ihr glaubt, sie wären fresh, waren Placebos
Ich sitz' mit zwölf Brüdern an einem Tisch, als wär' ich Jesus
Wir trinken so hart, dass ich drei Tage weg bin
Dann wache ich auf, mit blassem Teint, wie Michael Jackson
Und einer Weisheit für meine Gemeinde
Wenn das Leben dir Melonen gibt, nimm sie in deine Wohnung mit
Keiner weiß, wie man deinen Name spricht, wie Häagen-Dazs
Wenn du dich für ein Genie hältst, dann lebst du in einer Fantasiewelt, wie Legolas
Ich regel' das, wie das BGB mit einem nachgestellten Nebensatz

Ich hänge ab, wie 'n paar dicke Titten
Ich hänge ab, wie die Araber bei City Chicken
Du willst haten, jetzt mal ehrlich, dafür rap' ich zu fresh
Und der Beat ist zu dope um nicht mitzunicken

Ich hänge ab, wie 'n paar dicke Titten

Und der Beat ist zu dope um nicht mitzunicken

Und wenn ich mal kein'n Anfang find' für meinen Text
Bereite ich dem Dasein eines Whack MCs ein Ende
Jeder der Zeilen die ich setz'
Ist wie Schauspieler bei ihrem Nebenverdienst, sie spricht Bände
Jetzt mal Butter bei die Fische
Dich wundert das ein bisschen, ich bin unabgehoben, wie Fundamentalisten
Und gehe durch die Decke, wie der Scheich im Beduinen Zelt
Plus bringe Geist in das Herz dieser Maschinen Welt
Und nach meinem Tagewerk ruhe ich nicht wohlverdient
Sondern trage dein Yolo-Rap zurück auf das Holo-Deck
Quatsch nicht von Gürtellinie, denn die hängt so tief
Mit deinem Päckchen Weed in deinen verdreckten Jeans
Rapper reden von Penis, sie brauchen eine Messlatte
Es ging mir besser, als ich noch die Pest hatte
Es ging mir besser, als ich noch die Grippe hatte
Jetzt geht es mir schlechter, denn wir hören deine dritte Platte

Ich hänge ab, wie 'n paar dicke Titten
Ich hänge ab, wie die Araber bei City Chicken
Du willst haten, jetzt mal ehrlich, dafür rap' ich zu fresh
Und der Beat ist zu dope um nicht mitzunicken

Wenn es unter meinen Schuhen knirscht, war das wohl das Ungeziefer
Du sprichst gebrochenes Deutsch, treffe ich deinen Unterkiefer
Du musst ihn schienen, blau und rot sind im Grunde lila
Du fragst dich noch immer, wo der Unterschied bleibt
Das liegt doch auf der Hand, so wie Lebenslinien
Rapper wollen Beef, wir geben ihnen neue Betätigungsfelder
An der Supermarktkasse, eure Superkraft ist Superstars hassen
Doch bei mir würde selbst Tupac erblassen
Bei mir würde selbst Tupac erblassen!

Prinz Porno,"In den Jahren, wo ich verschwunden war, war ich stetig untertags
In Bibliotheken, um gänzlich ungestört vom
Fliehenden ? Leben einfach zu überlegen
Ob wir regiert werden, von mystischen Wesen
Von psychischen Befehlen geschickt werden
Lügen vernebeln, ihre Urheber stehen über den Regeln
Getragen durch Bilder und Worte, verpackt in kompakten Ideen
Im Konkreten sind wir gefangen, in abstrakten Systemen
Von Gesetzen, physikalischen, juristischen
Umso mehr ich studierte, wusste ich nur, wer ich nicht bin
Und wer meine Feinde sind, dass wir im All nicht allein sind
Die meinigen Texte haben eine zweiten Sinn
Über den leidigen Weg des Sprechgesangs in deinen Cortex
Wo sich die Idee erst fest, dann fort setzt
Yes Yo Raps, wenn du kein Strohhalm mehr hast, 
Dann halt dich an meinem Wort fest

Ich hab mich gefragt, wer die Welt regiert
Mindestens der Hälfte hier, sind solche Fragen scheiß egal
Geistig selbst kastriert

Auf Augenhöhe ins Regal

Ich bin nicht immer zu retten, auch wenn Rap das gerne hätte
Ich bin so wie die meisten, ich rap' nur für goldene Ketten
Das Dilemma das wir leben, wird von Max Herre geschrieben
Weil wir starten Che Guevara, doch wir enden auf Pro Sieben
Normal ist wie menschlich viel schlechter als man denkt, ich
Bin nicht bereit zu teilen, in meinem geistigen Gefängnis
Solang mein Dealer noch tickt, solang sein Reefer mich fickt
Mir Amazon jedes Jahr ein neues FIFA schickt
Solang mein Supermarkt voll mit frischen Waren ist
All die Schmerzmittel wirken, ich beklag' mich nicht
In meinem Fernseher, da lebt der Günther Jauch
Er liefert mir die Bildung ganz bequem auf meine Couch
Und die Antwort auf die Frage die er stellt die hab ich auch
Wir sorgen für den Frieden, wenn ihr Waffen bei uns kauft
Ich mag uns're Kanzlerin, weil sie nicht verlogen ist
Und das deutsche Land kein Asyl für Edward Snowden ist

Meine Freunde heben die Ws wie eine umgekehrte Packung M&Ms
Ich klatsch' Raps auf die Beats, wie ein piece end to end

Nur den gleichen Planeten, durch einen bedauernswerten Zufall

Meine Geschichte ist unendlich wie das Kinderbuch

Als wären wir paar Fehler zurück, dann plötzlich klüger

Prinz Porno,"Ey Toni, alter Kamerad, ich sitz' hier gerade
Am Frühstückstisch, bestreiche Schrippen mit Marmelade
Vor'm Fenster internationale Hipsterparade
Die mich stören beim Nachsinnen über wichtige Fragen
In meinem Kiez sind Touristen am Raven
Wollte mir nur kurz vom nächtlichen Schreiben mal meine Beine vertreten
Da versucht man Meisterwerke in sechzehn Takte zu gießen
Während sich Leute mit Chemos ihren Charakter vermiesen
Die verdammten Sub-Bässe rattern
Die Clubfressen gaffen auf einen der letzten Berliner, der nur seine Schrippen holt
Ich dachte, ich ruf mal durch und höre, was bei dir so geht
Während das Volk von überall in meiner Hood Videos dreht

Was bei mir so geht, was kann ich dir sagen
Ein paar attraktive Damen liegen nackt bei mir im Garten
An den Wasserskianlagen, ich häng ab in diesen Tagen
Und finde nichts, was ich nicht weiß in den Stadtarchivregalen
Nachts kann ich nicht schlafen
Ey yo, diesen Stephen Hawking hab ich in den letzten achtundsiebzig Schachpartien geschlagen
Ich will Submachineguns laden, denn ich brauch' Action
Seitdem selbst die Klitschkos keine Lust mehr auf Sparring mit mir haben

Ey, Boss, mal folgende Begebenheit
Man vergeudet seine Lebenszeit im Üblichen mit Trunkenheit und Schlägereien
In Dunkelheit von Alkohol und Drogen benebelt sein
Weil es bei den meisten doch zu Größerem ja eh nicht reicht
Doch zwischen all den Krepeleien, Werbung und Alltäglichkeit
Stieß ich vor kurzem auf einen interessanten Themenkreis
Durchs Internet, Entdeckung einer Inkastadt im Regenwald
Der Archäologe wurde binnen acht Tagen zum Pflegefall
Nach Beginn der Ausgrabung, wo Indioschamanen die weißen Teufel warnten, weiter zu graben
Da könnte man mal kurz die Wack-MCs Wack-MCs sein lassen
Den Learjet aus dem Hangar holen, etwas Kerosin verprassen
Du musst ja auch mal rauskommen wie Detox, mein Lieber
Das kann man hier so stehen lassen wie diese Mauer in China

Ey, jetzt, wo ich hier gelangweilt in mei'm großen Garten lieg
Vor mir das Fotografenteam eines Modemagazins
Wirkt die bloße Fantasie einer gefährlichen Mission
In 'nem Tropenparadies ja schon ganz attraktiv
Wenn man nur Großstadtstraßen sieht, vom Geld zählen müde ist
Erscheinen Adventures am anderen Ende der Welt echt verführerisch
Der Rest erübrigt sich, Fotoshootings können warten
Für todesmutige Taten, so, genug hier im Garten
Haut alle ab weg mit dem Kameragestell
Ist dieser Butler Samuel wieder beim Canasta-Duell
Mit Consuela und den Mädels der Hauswäscherei
Los, lauf einer los, holt mir den Faulpelz herbei
Hauptsächlich weil er mein Equipment packen muss
Und um dem Lauch mitzuteilen, dass er gleich mit mir fahren muss
Und das Equipment tragen muss, der Boss ist kein Backpacker
Ey yo, Pi, ich bin bereit und hoffe, der Jet ist klar

Im Untergrundhangar hinter geschmackvollen Parkanlagen
Ist der mattschwarze Learjet natürlich stets klar zum starten
Da die gottverdammten Models nur koksen und Champagner saufen
Und zankend Haze im blitzblanken Hangar rauchen
Gilt es, die schnell zu ersetzen
Wenn das Pirelli-Kalendershooting durch ist, dann haben wir neue Stewardessen
Und der Kapitän, die quasselnde, lahme Flitzpiepe
Tut, als würde er seine Waffen beladene MiG fliegen
Ich pack' mir meine Sporttasche, den Leinenanzug
Badehose, schwarze Pistole und seidenes Handtuch
Gelbes Mückenspray, geschmackvolle, geschmeidige Tücher
Und die Relativitätstheorie als Reiselektüre
Nur noch kurz die Beleuchtung von meinem Namen über der Stadt proben
Dann kommen wir dich in einer guten Viertelstunde abholen

Das ist zwar nicht der Komfort prächtiger Goldpaläste
Doch hier oben im Flieger über nächtlicher Wolkendecke
In Echtlederpolstersesseln mit Pumafellbezügen
Umgeben von Bräuten in sexy Stewardesskostümen
Die supereng anliegen, ist es auch nicht grad beklagenswert
Mal was anderes als ein Wohnzimmerabend mit Privatkonzert
Samuel, mein Glas ist leer, darum komm mal fix in Nullkommanix
Her und wehe du Dummkopf verkippst noch mal etwas vom Jahrgangs-Scotch
Nur weil du von dieser Dame da den Arsch anglotzt, die Maße hat wie Lara Croft
Pi, sag mir mal, wie war das noch auf der Internetadresse?
Du sprachst am Handy von irgend so 'ner Inkatempelstätte

Ja halt das übliche wir schleichen durch idyllische doch trügerische Steinkorridore
Beäugt dabei von übelsten Granitskulpturen von mystischen Götzen und Echsengöttern
Lass mich mal die Seite grade schnell auf meinem Laptop öffnen
Das Internet hier oben ist wie die Telekom da unten
Immer offline auch auf Hotline in jeder Form verschwunden
Einfach rauskommen aus dem Trott und durch Lianen in den Tropen waten
Während Stammeskrieger Curarepfeile in Bogen laden
Um uns kalt zu machen wie Eisskulpturdesigner einen Schwan
In dieser Leitkultur hat hier keiner einen Plan
Von den wirklich schweren Dingen
Aber guck mal da rechts wo ein erster Strahl Sonne den purpurnen Äther durchsetzt
Da genau unter der Tragfläche von dichten Wolken zugedeckt
Liegt eine Insel, nicht aufzufinden mit Google Maps
Da leben die, die Schluss machten wie Credit-Texter
Biggie, Pac oder Elvis, hier liegen sie in allerbester
Gesundheit in Strandstühlen, Endstation Südsee
Konserviert von Chirurgen, Ayurveda und grünem Tee
So jetzt ist die Page aber geladen, das hier meinte ich
Sagenumwobener Inkapalast voller Geheimnisse

Die Sonne geht auf, erscheint am Horizont blutrot
Wir sind mitten im Nichts so wie Robinson Crusoe
Und relaxen etwas nach den anstrengende Flugstunden
Bevor wir Fährten folgen, wie Suchtruppen mit Bluthunden
Das Vergnügen kann warten, denn ich wandle hier auf keinen mystischen Pfaden
Ohne Frühstück im Magen, ich will Rühreier braten
Kaffee und Burrito Snacks
Samuel hol Gasherd, Klapptisch und Mosquitonetz
Und halt das Ungeziefer von der Urwaldlichtung fern
Ich will nicht an Dschungelfieber oder Blutvergiftung sterben
Hab ich dann was im Bauch, dann kann das hier auch
Endlich starten, Pi, hol schon mal die Landkarte raus

Die Landkarte lag direkt neben dem Pfefferstreuer
Glaub, die hast du grade mit dem Rest der Bräute weggefeuert
Die einem keine Zeit für tiefere Gespräche lassen
Während Butler Heißgetränke einschenken in edle Tassen
Da liegt sie ja, studier du schon mal die Fliesenwege zum Tempel
Während ich dem Küchenchef die Leviten lese
Ey du Lausbub dein Krabbenomelett war schon traurig auf dem Boden deiner Pfanne verreckt
Also zack ran an die Kochstelle, paar Eier geschlagen
Und dann wird weitergebraten, so wie Haifisch in Asien
Und schwing mal die Tabascoflasche plus mahle Pfefferkörner
Denn der Prinz mag es scharf wie Samurais Katanaschwerter
Hurtig die Toasts in den Schacht reingeschoben wie U-Bahn in der Nacht in Metropolen
Die Frage ist doch nun lassen wir uns auf Händen tragen
Oder nehmen einen zur Hemdfarbe passenden Geländewagen
Oder schreiten gar selbst durch die wuchernde Botanik
Gehen mit gutem Beispiel voran, wie der Bug der Titanic
Und derselben Möglichkeit für den eigenen Untergang
Scheiß drauf, nun fangen die Adventures im Dschungel an

So lang die Wege es gestatten, nehmen wir den Wagen
Wird der Dschungel dann dichter, gehen wir auf den Pfaden
Und zwar so leise wie möglich
Verrät uns erst mal ein Schwarm kreischender Vögel, wird es leicht uns zu töten
Ich will auch nicht die Krieger des Dschungelvolks verschrecken
Die auf unerforschten Strecken im Unterholz versteckt sind
Und ihre wundervollen Schätze vor Fremden beschützen
Was glaubst du, was los ist, wenn sie uns am Tempel erwischen
Aber jetzt lass erst mal los, der Jeep ist beladen
Das erste Ziel ist schon nah, ich habs markiert auf der Karte
Wir fahren erst mal bis zum Kreuz an diesem Wasserfall
Vorausgesetzt, Samuel findet heute noch das Gaspedal
Jetzt läuft die Sache richtig an, ich glaub, ich sah
Erstaunlich nah ein Augenpaar durchs Dickicht starren
Sieh, wie der Farnbusch sich neigt, getarnt unter Zweigen
Beobachten sie uns, ich hab die Armbrust dabei
Und bin zum Warnschuss bereit
Denn die Pygmäen hier im Land sind eher weniger bekannt für ihre Harmlosigkeit
Doch wir fahren bloß vorbei auf den gewundenen Pfaden
Vorbei an Dschungellianen in den buntesten Farben
In dem verdunkelten Wagen
Denn lassen wir sie in Ruhe, versuchen sie auch uns nicht zu schaden
Dort unten im Tal, das muss der Wasserfall sein
Wir haben ihn fast schon erreicht vielleicht noch anderthalb Meilen
Aber halt, ich hab die Hand schon am Machetengriff
Siehst du den Baum mit der geschnitzten Aztekenschrift?
Guck, was daneben ist, siehst du diese Blutlachen?
Komm wir steigen aus und folgen den blutigen Fußstapfen

Ich entsicher bloß mal prophylaktisch ohne große Absicht
Die Waffe, falls doch noch einer ein Geschoss herabschickt
Denn auch ohne Nachtsicht, Fernglas oder Firlefarnz
Hab ich paar versteckte Krieger im grünen Gewirr erkannt
Folgen wir mal diesen Schriftzeichen
Jeden Umweg würde ich meiden
Auf uns zeigen dutzende von Giftpfeilen
In Blasrohren aus Bambus, aber scheiß drauf
Leben ist wie das olympische 3000 Meter Rennen, ein Kreislauf
Gut getarnt wie Echsen bahnen wir Pfade
Durch die Farngewächse wuchend über Straßennetzen
Der mystischen Tempelstadt, noch gut hundert Meter
Und wir sind an dem Wasserfall den du gesehen hast
Wenn die Karte hier stimmt, dann geht man bis zum Ufer
Und man springt dann, doch die stets langsame Dienerschaft
Deren Erziehung erschöpfend ist wie der Liebesakt
Der Libellen in Limastadt (der ja tödlich endet!)
Hat die Taucherausrüstung samt Sauerstoffflaschen
Mit ihrem letzten Funken Verstand zuhause gelassen
Ich hab schon größere Schätze aus einem reißend fließenden Fluss geholt
Darum Jacke aus und dann ganz tief Luft geholt

Mit einem geschmeidigen Sprung in das grünliche Nass
Nach dem üblichen Platsch sinkt meine Physis hinab
Im Augenwinkel reptilienhafte Schatten
Die mit kalten Augen ihr Ziel erfassen
Im Nacken wie Markennamen
Ich identifizere den Rohstoff von gut und gerne zehn Krokodilhandtaschen
Zwischen den schwarzen Fahnen
Doch man kann in diesen Wassern hier auch anders sterben
Große Piranhaschwärme heften sich an die Fersen
Zwischen Muränen und anderen Karnivoren stehen 
Versunkene Säulen im fahlen Licht wie Ganoven
Ein paar energische Züge auf etwa zehn Meter Tiefe
Seh ich den Eingang wie ein Maul gebildet aus Stalagmiten
Nach weiteren Schwimmbewegungen zieht der letzte Rest Luft 
Aus den gequälten Lungen, wie Raubtiere im Nebeldunst
Aufsteigende schillernde Blasen dort am Ende des schwarzen 
Tunnels seh ich Lichtstrahlen mit Killern schon warten
Darum steig ich aus dem Wasser zücke die Gun
Drücke sie dann macht es bam ba-ba-bam
Wie Ringo Starrs rechter Fuß mit der Drum
Und ich bin nur noch von kurz über dem Wasser sirrenden Mücken umtanzt
Die Gegner sinken nieder zu einem olivfarbenen Kleiderhaufen
Ey Boss, du kannst die Zigarre wieder weiter rauchen

Yeah, ich bin heiß gelaufen jetzt, wo hier der Spaß beginnt
Ich merke, wie mein Jagdinstinkt aufblitzt, wie mein Platinring
Es liegt Gefahr im Wind, ich kann spüren, wie nah wir sind
Ein Flüstern kommt von dort aus den Tiefen dieses Labyrinths
Ich nehm schnell die Fackel von der steinernen Wand
Halt sie mit eiserner Hand und jetzt rein in den Gang
Ein schleifender Klang, ein Rascheln und Knacken
Da war was, leider ließ es die Fackel im Schatten
Getrappel von Ratten, aufgeschreckte Fledermäuse
Siehst du den Lichtschein dort, der uns den Weg erleuchtet?
Da muss was - Vorsicht, eine Falltür im Boden
Und wir schlittern nach unten mit gewaltigem Tosen
Landen in Knochenbergen und angenagten Totenschädeln
Umklammert von Bodennebel, dann der Klang von Bogensehnen
Pfeilgeschosse gehen nieder
Abgefeuert von halbgekleideten, gewaltbereiten, eingeborenen Kriegern
Ey yo, in äußerster Not fang' ich 'nen Pfeil aus der Luft
Dreh' ihn um, werf' zurück und der Häuptling ist tot
Sie ziehen sich zurück in verstecke Pfade und Gänge
Es bleiben barbarische Klänge, Schamanengesänge
Und auf einmal setzen sich die Knochen zusammen
Erheben sich, leere Augenhöhlen glotzen uns an
Ein Skelett kommt an, ich nehm sein Kopf in die Hand
Hol aus und schlag mit ihm ein motherfucking Loch in die Wand
Yeah, und wir schlagen uns durch die Armee der Knochengerippe
Ich verteil lockere Tritte oder box sie in Stücke
Dann noch ein paar Schritte und wir sind raus aus der Hölle
Und drinnen in einem weiteren, verstaubten Gewölbe
Wo auf 'nem Goldaltar das Ziel unserer Reise steht
Sich von nem tiefroten Energiestrom umkreist erhebt
Ein Tomahawk mit pulsierend glühender Inschrift
Ich greif durch den Energiekreis, berühre das Ding mit
Beiden Händen und irgendetwas explodiert
Irgendetwas detoniert, wir müssen weg von hier
Schmutzige Wassermassen durchströmen die Gänge
Ich seh hoch, irgendwo hat diese Höhle ein Ende
Nehm die Armbrust, schieß ein Seil mit Widerhaken rauf
Und wir klettern beide hoch und ziehen uns daran raus von hier
Dort oben ist 'ne Öffnung, ich hab 's Licht schon gesehen
Kletter weiter, Griff des Tomahawks zwischen den Zähnen

Auf der Spitze der Pyramide wie die Illuminaten
Gegner wie depressive Volksgruppen niedergeschlagen
Hier opferten sie einst Göttern mit schwierigen Namen
In diesen heutigen Tagen vermag sie niemand zu sagen
Wie wir hier so stehen, ist deshalb ein Bild für die Götter
Alter und neue befüllen sie Magazine und Köcher
Über dem Dschungel kreisen Schwärme von Raubvögeln
Während sich rotleuchtende Augen aus diesen Schatten herauslösen
Am Horizont kommen Killer, die wollen uns auch töten
Ich kann die Namen all meiner Feinde schon im Rauch lesen
Doch so ist das Leben an der Spitze als Kings
Alle wollen dich brechen wie die Spitze von der Nase der Sphynx
Ein majestätisches Farbenspiel, jetzt wo die Nacht naht
Eigentlich kann man sterben, wenn man all diese Pracht sah
Lage sieht schwierig aus, Luft wird schiefergrau
Doch wir rauchen noch in Ruhe unsere Cohibas auf
Umhüllt von den letzten Schwaden von ihrem Rauch
Zieht uns ein Kabel vom schwarzen Heli wieder rauf
Und so schweben wir weg, elegant, wie wir kamen
Richtung bildschöner Damen bekannt von Leinwand und Dramen
Ihren Namen auf internatioalen Filmplakaten
So leben die Kings in diesen Tagen, Bitch

ich geh' an allen vorbei, mit folgenden Worten:
Gästeliste plus zwei
Und einen goldenen Schuss hab' ich noch frei

Dass du kommst Kumpel, doch jetzt bist du da und die Party startet“

Unten gibt es nur Intrigen, Sinnkrisen, Zweckkriege
Arme Menschen, die die reichen von sich weg schieben

Ich weiß die Zeilen hier sind ungewohnt einfach, aber es passt perfekt

Von oben da ist alles leichter, wirken Probleme kleiner
Und wenn man tot ist, dann scheißt man auf alle seine Lebensgeister

Weil man sie nicht befolgt, während die eigene Zeit vorbei treibt
Denke ich, während ich Jesus high five
Hier im Himmel sind nur Stars, es ist ein crazy Nightlife
Doch unter uns, es ist doch langweilig
Wenn man nicht mehr sterben kann
Geht man mit seinem Körper schlechter um
Ich führe lange Selbstgespräche über die Berechtigung
Der Spezies von diesen Whack MCs
Während von unten irgendein Künstler durch die Decke schießt
Und sich zwei Jahre später selbst mit einer Überdosis
In einen der Pophimmel zwei Etagen über Bro'Sis
So mäandert meine Logik über Gleichnisse
Durchstreift Riffe von Argumenten so wie Haifische
Bis ich zu dem Schluss komme, man darf da nicht weich werden

Prinz Porno,"Die Steine meiner Stadt haben keine Augen oder Ohren
Unterscheiden keine Tage oder Nacht
Doch mit unser'n Leben, unser'n Kriegen
Den Verlusten und den Siegen
Unser'n schwindenden Familien, schleifen wir sie ab
Der Boden der Moschee spürt den Teppich und die Gläubigen
Die Sonne wärmt die Platten vor dem Dom, die noch heute sind
Wo man sie eins niederlegte, als in der Stadt noch Kutschen fuhren
Bevor durch sie zwei Kriege fegten
Sie werden liebkost von Herbstsonne und Nieselregen
Speichern Anekdoten, die sie nie erzählen
Die Mauern, in die Knastinsassen, Schwüre oder Hasstiraden
Oder ihre Namen schreiben, fang' manchmal an fast zu atmen
In Nächten wo der Mond glüht
Es unmöglich ist zu unterscheiden zwischen Träumen und wachen Phasen
Die Brücke überrollt von Autoscharen
Während Menschen die keiner sieht, unter ihnen traumlos schlafen

Wir fragen uns, ist da wer, oder sind wir nur alleine
Irgendwann werden wir Fossilien, Spur der Steine
Fels wird Sand, das Element bleibt nur pur im Kleinen
Wir sehen zu und treiben auf der Spur der Steine

Der eine Stein vom Mariannenplatz hat es am ersten Mai
Hoch in eine Hand geschafft, die ihn dann mit ganzer Kraft
Schleudert bis er an die blecherne Wand einer Wanne kracht
Er zu Boden taumelt, neben schwarzen Stiefeln niedersteigt
Bis man ihn wieder greift, wieder schmeisst
Bis er endlich liegenbleibt
Im Wiederschein von brennenden Reifen, noch ein Laster
Wäscht mit Hochdruck Wasser über's Kopfsteinpflaster
Wo sich die Steine aneinanderschmiegen
Als Symbol für die Stadtbewohner, die mal auseinanderziehen
Sich woanders neu zusammenfügen, in Ehen, WGen und Altersheimen
Kinder werden geboren und die Greise sterben
Während die Steine immer starr in ihrer Haltung bleiben
Und nur widerwillig kleine Spuren von Alter zeigen

Wir fragen uns, ist da wer, oder sind wir nur alleine
Irgendwann werden wir Fossilien, Spur der Steine
Fels wird Sand, das Element bleibt nur pur im Kleinen
Wir sehen zu und treiben auf der Spur der Steine

Die Grabsteine warten mit den Toten auf die Ewigkeit
Variabel in den Daten ihrer Lebenszeit
Gleich in der Akustik, weil hier jeder schweigt
Nebel steigt nicht höher als Büsche hier, der Zähler zeigt
Andere Werte in der Körpergröße, Kontostand, Kinderanzahl
Manche ungekleidet, in Seiden- oder Wintermantel
Neben- und hintereinander in Kisten aus Fichten oder Buchen
Während die Wurzeln der Bäume die toten Brüder suchen
Sie sich vereinigen im steinigen Erdreich
Bedeckt von Kies, den einst ein Meer vor sich hertreibt
Vieles ist Unterschied, doch es bleibt mehr gleich
Denn jeden den es hierhin hinunterzieht, wollte mehr Zeit
Zähflüssiger Teer schweißt die Pflastersteine eben
Wie Sägespäne Blut in der Manege eines Zirkuszeltes
Bedecken sie nur Dramen und Probleme
Auch aus härtesten Granitbrocken werden am Ende Wege

Wir fragen uns, ist da wer, oder sind wir nur alleine
Irgendwann werden wir Fossilien, Spur der Steine
Fels wird Sand, das Element bleibt nur pur im Kleinen
Wir sehen zu und treiben auf der Spur der Steine

Prinz Porno,"Ich kann meine Sicht der Dinge gern' erklären
Eltern haben nie Zeit und so werden wir erzogen von den Fernsehserien
Und ihren Charakteren
Die auf uns abfärben, bis wir selber welche werden
Seit jeher streben Menschen nach in Form'n gepresst'n seltnen Erzen
Moralische Werte gleichen langsam schmelzenden Kerzen
Irgendwann sind sie amorphe Massen Wachs
Du liebst nur dann, wenn du auch was zu hassen hast
Deine ganze Last nahmen dir die Priester ab, heute die Therapeuten
In Zeiten von Wikileaks lässt sich alles schwerer leugnen
Doch es geht noch
Und so tragen die größten Verbrecher Maßanzüge oder Uniformen
Der neue Jesus ist noch ungeboren, doch meine Freundin schwanger
Nichts hat sich geändert, ich bin nur etwas bekannter
In der Welt der Marken, hat alles Rang und Namen
Darum wandte ich mich ab und hörte auf den Klang der Farben ?

Sie sagen „Oh oh, ein Mörder, von dem man gehört hat
Der tötet Rapper mit Wörtern, hat im Keller die Körper
Oh oh, ein Mörder! Oh oh, ein Mörder!
Schnell weg mit dem Curser, wenn er das mal nicht gehört hat“

Philosophen und Computerspiele haben mich verändert
Ich bin eine Spielfigur und stoße gegen die Ränder
Des Bildschirms meiner Realität
Das ist eines meiner Gleichnisse, dass jeder versteht
Die anderen sind schwieriger
Die Welt ist ein Konzept, das wir formen mit Gedanken
Wir tragen Komplexe mit uns, wie ein Ranzen
Und müssen ihn loswerden - verlernen, was wir lernten
Denn wir kamen aus der Ferne von den Sternen
Ich hänge bei der NASA ab, sie sagen ich wär' Überking
Doch seit Kubrick's Film vom Mond weiß ich, dass sie Lügner sind
Will nur die Schlüssel für die Raumstation und Jetpack
Chaos im Kopf gebändigt von einem Yankee Snapback in dunkelblau
Ich gebe einen Fick auf nichts und niemand
Seit zwei Jahren produzieren sie mich in China
Meine Klone sehen aus wie ich, nur riechen metallisch
Ihre Quelle der Gewalt ist auch die Wurzel eures Neides

Sie sagen „Oh oh, ein Mörder, von dem man gehört hat
Der tötet Rapper mit Wörtern, hat im Keller die Körper
Oh oh, ein Mörder! Oh oh, ein Mörder!

Prinz Porno,"Auch wenn der Beat zwar versöhnlich ist, dann nur die Töne, Bitch
Der Inhalt dieses Liedes ist nix schöneres
Als der Instinkt eines Löwen ist
Befehle an die Pfoten, immer 
Wenn eine Gruppe Antilopen auf der nächsten Anhöhe sich
Kurz ausruht, bevor das alte Raubtier sie packt
Denn wie wir alle ist es im Töten Autodidakt
Mit dem metallenen Geschmack von Blut, geht es auf in die Nacht
Zwischen den Zeilen lesend, sehe ich weisse Linien
Alles wird zu Staub und sie ziehen ihn
Bis sie an der Spitze eines Stiefels enden, wie Sizilien
Mein Song ist wie Fußball, die Kids spielen ihn

Es könnte in diesem Song um Freiheit gehen
Oder um ein anderes tiefsinniges Thema
Doch ich führ' dich in die Irre wie das Wort „Weisheitszene“

Du denkst Rap ist Kunst? Die wäre abstrakt
Das wäre doch leicht, hier ist alles erlaubt
Bin ich fertig mit Nummer 2, wird das restliche Haus
Eingerissen und um mein Produkt ein Museum gebaut
Tickets verkauft, Kataloge gedruckt
Laudatios auf diese Großtat geschrieben
Ich fing an als der Beste, year, fresh wie Will Smith
Als der Prinz of Bel Air, nur ich bin es geblieben
P zu dem gottverdammten O, mein gut abgehangener Flow
Ändert nichts an dem Fakt, dass deine stadtbekannte Hoe
Dick suckt und wie meine Kritiker bemerken werden, das war nur ein Zweckreim
Doch damit wird der 16er geschlossen, 
Wie die Mauer von einem Eckstein

Ich hab' hier eine neue Idee für den Refrain
Wir machen das, wie bei diesem anderen Song „Parfum“
Einfach mal was freilassen im Sinne der Kunst

Ah, ich war Verschwörungstheoretiker
Durch meine Songs tätiger Prediger des neuesten Testaments
Prophezeite, was der Rest erkennt, erst wenn der Westen brennt
Und man das letzte Hemd als weisse Fahne hisst
Ich könnte Quellen angeben, aber euch sagen diese Namen nichts, bis es Panik gibt
Ich machte Praktika bei Rothschild, nach Treffen von den Bilderbergern
Ließen sie mich morgens ihre Spuren aus der Villa kärchern
Auf hoher See - treibt das Flaggschiff in die Minen
Wird sich wer spiegeln in dem Lack von Limousinen
Sonne brennt auf matte Pick-Up Trucks
Wo die RPG im Himmel über Kurdistan die MIG erfasst
Und die Kalash ist nicht Schild und Schwert
Sondern Pixel für den Berg, der die Bilder nährt

The birds and the bees only know which way to fly

But your eyes are like billboards, they give you away
Your mouth is a trumpet, somebody else plays
Long after the notes gone, the tone usually stays

And your chest a fine pillow, with lining of feather
Your hair is a family, with strands stick together
Fingers are keys from the grandest piano, played by a line that the Lord only knew

A tongue of an angel, floats in red wine saliva
Your teeth ravel porcelain, made by masters in China
Your face can't be captured by pictures or words
And your voice is a music that I've never heard

And your skin is a cream, dipped out beyond measure
Your nose is a peak never touched by the weather
Your fingers are keys from the grandest piano

Priscilla Herdman,"It's fifty long springtimes since she was a bride,
But still you may see her at each Whitsuntide
In a dress of white linen with ribbons of green,
As green as her memories of loving.

The feet that were nimble tread carefully now,
As gentle a measure as age will allow,
Through groves of white blossoms, by fields of young corn, 
Where once she was pledged to her true love.

The fields they stand empty, the hedges grow free--
No young men to turn them, our pastures go seed
They are gone where the forests of oak trees before
Have gone, to be wasted in battle.

Down from the green farmlands and from their loved ones
Marched husbands and brothers and fathers and sons.
There's a fine roll of honor where the Maypole once stood, 
And the ladies go dancing at Whitsun.

There's a straight row of houses in these latter days 
All covering the downs where the sheep used to graze. 
There's a field of red poppies, a wreath from the Queen 
But the ladies remember at Whitsun, 
And the ladies go dancing at Whitsun. ",Dancing at Whitsun
Priscilla Herdman,"An hour before the sun goes down 
Behind the ragged boughs, 
I go across the little run 
And bring the dusty cows; 
And once I used to sit and rest 
Beneath the fading dome, 
For there was one that I loved best 
Who'd bring the cattle home. 

Our yard is fixed with double bails, 
Round one the grass is green, 
The bush is growing through the rails, 
The spike is rusted in; 
And 'twas from there his freckled face 
Would turn and smile at me -- 
He'd milk a dozen in the race 
While I was milking three. 

I milk eleven cows myself 
Where once I milked but four; 
I set the dishes on the shelf 
And close the dairy door; 
And when the glaring sunlight fails 
And the fire shines through the cracks, 
I climb the broken stockyard rails 
And watch the bridle-tracks. 

He kissed me twice and once again 
And rode across the hill, 
The pint-pots and the hobble-chain 
I hear them jingling still; 
He'll come at night or not at all -- 
He left in dust and heat, 
And when the soft, cool shadows fall 
Is the best time to meet. 

And he is coming back again, 
He wrote to let me know, 
The floods were in the Darling then -- 
It seems so long ago; 
He'd come through miles of slush and mud, 
And it was weary work, 
The creeks were bankers, and the flood 
Was forty miles round Bourke. 

He said the floods had formed a block, 
The plains could not be crossed, 
And there was foot-rot in the flock 
And hundreds had been lost; 
The sheep were falling thick and fast 
A hundred miles from town, 
And when he reached the line at last 
He trucked the remnant down. 

And so he'll have to stand the cost; 
His luck was always bad, 
Instead of making more, he lost 
The money that he had; 
And how he'll manage, heaven knows 
(My eyes are getting dim), 
He says -- he says -- he don't -- suppose 
I'll want -- to -- marry -- him. 

As if I wouldn't take his hand 
Without a golden glove -- 
Oh! Jack, you men won't understand 
How much a girl can love. 
I long to see his face once more -- 
Jack's dog! thank God, it's Jack! -- 
(I never thought I'd faint before) 
He's coming -- up -- the track.

Priscilla Herdman,"When you've come to make your fortune, and you haven't made your salt, 
And the reason of your failure isn't anybody's fault-
When you haven't got a billet, and the times are very slack, 
There is nothing that can spur you like the shame of going back; 
Chorus: 
Crawling home with empty pockets, Going back hard-up; 
Oh! it's then you learn the meaning of ""humiliation's cup"". 

When the place and you are strangers and you struggle all alone, 
And you have a mighty longing for the town where you are known; 
When your clothes are very shabby, and the future's very black, 
There is nothing that can hurt you like the shame of going back
Going home with empty pockets, Going back hard-up; 
Oh! it's then you learn the meaning of ""humiliation's cup"". 

When we've fought the battle bravely and are beaten to the wall, 
'Tis the sneer of man, not conscience, that makes cowards of us all; 
And while you are returning, oh! your brain is on the rack, 
And your heart is in the shadow of the shame of going back. 

When a beaten man's discovered with a bullet in his brain, 
They post-mortem him, and try him, and they say he was insane; 
But it very often happens that he'd lately got the sack, 
And his onward move was owing to the shame of going back.
Going home with empty pockets, Going back hard-up; 
Oh! it's then you learn the meaning of ""humiliation's cup"". 

Ah! my friend, you call it nonsense, and your upper lip is curled-- 
You have had no real trouble in your passage through the world; 
But when fortune rounds upon you and the rain is on the track, 
You will learn the bitter meaning of the shame of going back; 
Going home with empty pockets, Going back hard-up; 
Oh! it's then you taste the poison in ""humiliation's cup"".

Cause falling in love just makes me blue
Well, the music plays and you display your heart for me to see
I had a beer and now I hear you calling out for me
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

Well, the room is crowded, people everywhere
And I wonder, should I offer you a chair?
Well, if you sit down with this old clown, take that frown and break it
Before the evening's gone away, I think that we can make it
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

Well, the night does funny things inside a man
These old tom-cat feelings you don't understand
Well, I turn around to look at you, you light a cigarette
I wish I had the guts to bum one, but we've never met
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

I can see that you are lonesome just like me
And it being late, you'd like some company
Well, I turn around to look at you, and you look back at me
The guy you're with he's up and split, the chair next to you's free
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me

Now it's closing time, the music's fading out
Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout

My home away from home
In the state of New York I came of age
When first I started roaming
And the trees grow high in New York State
And they shine like gold in the autumn
Never had the blues from whence I came
But in New York State I got 'em

Talk to me of Mendocino
Closing my eyes I hear the sea
Must I wait
Must I follow
Won't you say come with me

And it's on to South Bend, Indiana
Flat out on the western plain
Rise up over the Rockies 
And down on into California
Out to where but the rocks again
And let the sun set on the ocean
I will watch it from the shore
Let the sun rise over the redwoods
I'll rise with it till I rise no more

And think of all the places that I've been,
Railroad yards and prison guards,
All the dumpy little towns along the stem
And the whispering of the people
As they watch every move that I go through;
I remember all those things,
Mostly I remember loving you.

cho: I remember loving you,
Back when the world was new,
And I think you loved me too,
I remember loving you,

The buckskin smells so the people tell
As we huddled in the boxcar from the rain;
Flashing lights that cut the night,
The railroad bull that pulled us off the train,
When the winter's cold and the Norther blows
I'm huddled in the corner 'til I'm blue;
I remember all these things,
Mostly I remember loving you.

Winter streets where the frozen sleet
Comes soaking through the cardboard in my shoes,
Where the promised land might be a place
Where a man could find free cigarettes and booze,
And the alleyways full of ragged strays,
The doorway wine I tell my troubles to,
I remember all these things,
Mostly I remember loving you.

",I Remember Loving You
Priscilla Herdman,"In every heart there is a room 
A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds from lovers past
Until a new one comes along

I spoke to you in cautious tones
You answered me with no pretense 
And still I feel I said too much 
My silence is my self defense

And every time I've held a rose
It seems I only felt the thorns
And so it goes, and so it goes
And so will you soon I suppose

But if my silence made you leave
Then that would be my worst mistake
So I will share this room with you
And you can have this heart to break

And this is why my eyes are closed
It's just as well for all I've seen
And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows

So I would choose to be with you
That's if the choice were mine to make
But you can make decisions too
And you can have this heart to break

The pines and the willows know soon we will part. 
There's a whisper in the wind of promises unspoken, 
And a love that will always remain in my heart. 

My thoughts will return to the sound of your laughter, 
The magic of moving as one, 
And a time we'll remember long ever after 
The moonlight and music and dancing are done. 

Will we climb the hills once more? 
Will we walk the woods together? 
Will I feel you holding me close once again? 
Will every song we've sung stay with us forever? 
Will you dance in my dreams or my arms until then? 

Under the moon the mountains lie sleeping 
Over the lake the stars shine. 
They wonder if you and I will be keeping 
The magic and music, or leave them behind.

And neither have I wings to fly
Give me a boat that will carry two
And both shall row my love and I

It grows and blossoms like a rose
It has a sweet and pleasant smell
No flower on Earth can it excel

A ship there is and she sails the sea
She's loaded deep as deep can be
But not so deep as the love I'm in
I know not if I sink or swim

And love's a jewel while it is new

So what are you working on

There ain't that many flowers in the garden
So what aches you from dusk till dawn

But I swear sweet darling I do
I just wish you didn't work so late every single day

All thanks to peter's piper, Mary can pay the bills 
She can't get a 9 to 5 cause she ain't go to college

Evey since baby's daddy went away 
She gave up her sweet little puddin' pie 
Now shes got little boy blue on her side 
Screamin' ""Georgie Pordgie let me in"" 
Saying ""not by the hair of my chiny chin chin"" 
She scribbled down I hate you on his subpoena papers 
This baby's yours and I need support 

Mary used to be a pretty maid, now shes hustling to get paid 
Georgie promised her the finer things, till baby blue was born 
Now she sits up all alone at night, wipin tear drops from her eyes 
Wishin' Georgie did her right since baby came alone

And weep by the willows

Some days I put on my Sunday best 
And take a picture in your favorites dress
To lay in beside your permanent bed 
To re pleas the one whose been blown with the wind

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

I sat me down to write a simple story
Which maybe in the end became a song
In trying to find the words which might begin it
I found these were the thoughts I brought along

At first I took my weight to be an anchor
And gathered up my fears to guide me round
But then I clearly saw my own delusion
And found my struggles further bogged me down

In starting out I thought to go exploring
And set my foot upon the nearest road
In vain I looked to find the promised turning
But only saw how far I was from home

In searching I forsook the paths of learning
And sought instead to find some pirate's gold
In fighting I did hurt those dearest to me
And still no hidden truths could I unfold

I sat me down to write a simple story
Which maybe in the end became a song
The words have all been writ by one before me
We're taking turns in trying to pass them on

I was about to jump into the air when a guy from the street called 
He said, 'Hey wait a minute! Don't you realize the danger? 
What do you think you are, some kind of angel?' 

I considered for a minute, realized he spoke the truth. 
For the barbells on my eyelids only emphasized my youth 
And the sawdust in my plimsolls means the same to him as me 
But that's neither here nor further, so I spoke considerately 
Now if you understand just what I'm trying to say, 
Whatever you do, don't grin, you'll give the game away!'

In the anger of the moment I had diced with death and lost 
It seemed to me the time was right so I burst into song 
In the anger of the moment the crowd began to sing along

I must have flown a mile, or maybe it was eight 
Thought to myself pretty soon I'd hit the Golden Gates

Explore the ship, replace the cook,

And no one left alive.

We sailed for parts unknown to man,
Where ships come home to die.
No lofty peak, nor fortress bold,
Could match our captain's eye.
Upon the seventh seasick day,
We made our port of call.
A sand so white, and sea so blue,
No mortal place at all.

We fired the guns, and burned the mast,
And rowed from ship to shore.

Our tears were tears of joy!

Save the world and be the king
I was out there in the race
Trying hard to force the pace

In the wee small hours of sixpence
And the lighted chandelier
Stands a rusty old retainer
Whose old eyes are filled with tears
For his master, good sir galant,
Who is now off to the wars
And although his eyes are crying
We know grief is not the cause
And if grief is not the reason
He must be of sterner stuff
And his sword though old and rusty
Must be blunt as sharp enough

In the wee small hours of sixpence
And the broken window pane
Stand the remnants of the evening
Who are waiting all in vain
For the crowing of the cockerel
Showing morning is not night
But the air is filled with silence
And the daylight is not bright
But still darkness is no reason
We are men of sterner stuff
And our swords though old and rusty
Still are blunt as sharp enough.

In the wee small hours of sixpence
And the hat-stand in the hall
Waiting only for the morning
Shadows flitting 'cross the wall
And perhaps that old retainer
Whom now giving of his all
May have once been just as we are
And now has no face at all.

And his sword though old and rusty
Still was blunt as sharp enough.

Everybody crazy as a coon
I'm running round in my underpants
Trying to find some kinda romance

Quarter past three [sic] on lime street
I got whipped right offa my feet
Didn't realize that I'd been caught
Till I found myself in the county court

'mr judge,' I said, 'won't you please be kind
Have pity on me, a poor orphan child? '
Mr judge he says with a long mean frown
'orphan or not, you're going down!'

Well I screamed on my knees in the witness box,
'lord have mercy on my golden locks.'

He says, 'the only kind of blonde you are's a peroxide!'

Stretched out on the floor I lay helpless 
Of my limbs I had lost all command 
When into my ear instilling fear 
Said a voice ""I am Monsieur R. Monde"" 

""Monsieur R. Monde you are not! 
That's an incredible thing to say 
For I personally attended his funeral 
which was twelve months to this very day!""

Alighted upon my right ear 
said ""If Monsieur R. Monde is safe under the sod 
Then why are you shaking with fear!"" 

""My name is not Scrooge"" I said faintly 
""and from ghosts I have nothing to fear! 
But if you are R. Monde returned from the dead

From nowhere a voice to me cried

The cause for the fighting has long been a ghost
Malice and habit have now won the day
The honours we fought for are lost in the fray

Standards and bugles are trod in the dust
Wounds have burst open, and corridors rust
Once proud and truthful, now humbled and bent
Fires which burnt brightly, now energies spent

Let down the curtain, and exit the play

Our poems and letters have turned to deceptions

'Explore the ship, replace the cook: let no one leave alive!'
Across the straits, around the Horn: how far can sailors fly?
A twisted path, our tortured course, and no one left alive

We sailed for parts unknown to man, where ships come home to die
No lofty peak, nor fortress bold, could match our captain's eye
Upon the seventh seasick day we made our port of call
A sand so white, and sea so blue, no mortal place at all

We fired the gun, and burnt the mast, and rowed from ship to shore

Procol Harum,"I sat me down to write a simple story 
Which maybe in the end became a song 
In trying to find the words which might begin it 
I found these were the thoughts I brought along 

At first I took my weight to be an anchor 
And gathered up my fears to guide me round 
But then I clearly saw my own delusion 
And found my struggles further bogged me down 

In starting out I thought to go exploring 
And set my foot upon the nearest road 
In vain I looked to find the promised turning 
But only saw how far I was from home 

In searching I forsook the paths of learning 
And sought instead to find some pirate's gold 
In fighting I did hurt those dearest to me 
And still no hidden truths could I unfold

Procol Harum,"Each man has a soul
That struggles to escape
And in the shallows of his dreams
We can often see its wake

For we all have our secrets
That we all keep deep inside
Away from light, in darkest night
Where it's always safe to hide

Away from all that we should meet
Less someone else should share
That thing that hides inside our soul
That we pray was never there

And out upon that ocean
A lifetime from the shore
Miguel stood his night watch
Recalling everything he saw

For he was a deckhand
Aboard the ""maersk dubai""
He had sailed her round the world
From hamburg to sendai

But this trip had been different
More than any he had known
For on board there was an evil
And the evil had been shown

For halfway through this voyage
They had found two stowaways
That the captain had thrown in the sea
And left them to the waves

And when he tried to close his eyes
And pretend he did not know
The evil did not go away
But used the time to grow

For later on that same trip
They found a stowaway once again
But the captain soon met this one too
And brought him to the same cold end

He wondered what that boy thought inside
Before that final sleep
When water was all that was around
And his lungs had screamed breathe deep

He wondered what went through his mind
As he gasped for air
And the last moment when he prayed for help
To find nobody there

He wondered to himself
If he could have been the one
To stand up at that moment

And say this cannot be done
To stand up to the captain
And say this thing it cannot be
But there is nothing closer to god on earth
Than a captain on the sea

And he was just a deckhand
With no right to plead the case
Of this stranger in their midst
And so he kept his place

And what is done is done
And undone cannot be
And so he pushed it from his mind

And stared out across the sea",Underture

Hurry up son, man it's like 90 man, let's get some hoes or something.

No doubt, ain't nothing new... .
Let's take a little spin, dun, word up.

Yo... open my wings to a new day spread my lungs
Get laced, jump in the whip, stash the guns
Twist the key, shifted to D then flee
Before anything, get the daily dose of choke
We got the Benzo flooded with smoke on the float

Lean my seat a taste, lumbar support
On the belt doin' 90 or more
debatin' on the latest rhyme wars
Where units don't count
But your rap pay add up to large amounts
Get my thrills puttin' other nigga's skills to sleep
Catch chills off'a infamous beats
Swing the trees doin' one-handed you'ees
Blowin' on the ouwee ?cause we can't have the medicine canoein'
There go the boys to the right, no days and nights like that
Ay yo dun, hold that down and turn it around

ay yo P', (what up) you my co-d, we both get knocked
What you did with that half'a tree? (right in my sock.)
Yo, I hope these fuckin' dicks won't find the stash spot
Dun, you know how I get down!?!
Yo I'm ready to bounce
Do the 100 yard-dash and tear ass
If my other half was alive we woulda got killt
?'cause dun woulda went for the guns and got ill
Plus I gots cracks on me, they foundt the cracks on me
Looked at'em, gave'em back to me
I could swore they was takin' us in
Then the lady in the car said, ?..that's not them.?
Picked us up, told me I could keep the drugs
They didn't give a fuck, they was only lookin' for guns
An' you ain't gotta tell us twice

On our way up-town for more of that funk

Bring her to the mini mansion, told me she want to be a bunny 
Said she like the way I talk dirty

P the type of vulture to fly a girl wit me
Outta state send her back to you on some freak shit

I flash back we was little niggas livin most real
1989's when we first met
We first clicked over convo' gettin twisted
In dunn grand earth crib cuttin outta school
Watchin cable it seemed like the other day
Through the eyes of a stranger we was kids
But in our own minds we was grown mens
Outside on the block we would play the bench
And y'all play the rock every chance y'all got
As I sat back and just watched hey, what can I say?
The same back then as I am today
I can recall me, Jemel and Jamal
In the room drinkin straight vodka with they moms
When I walk home with the big nefertiti charm
Back with the light blue camoflauge suit

And I was still holdin one shot derringers

Left with just thoughts of the past to reminisce

A lotta times we even took the click overseas

Sitting in the staircase with Bacardi
Bring the honeycomb speaker outside to bang
While we would share drinks with the other that came
Triple L stayed takin they cash in dice games
Killer Black grew to keep an ice grill, dunn was not playin
Yammy, the most Infamous told me one day
""Put the bogies down 'fore I pound you out P""
But it was all love, we was eash others dunns
We held each other down, borrowed each other guns
It's hard to believe that niggas so strong 
Could die so easily forever be gone
I could still feel the web of your palm, against mine 
'Cause we did our hand shake all the time
Why it have to be your time to go and not mines?
Spilled tears contemplating to my delf cryin
All the laughs we shared and fights we had
All the nights we would get nice, damn

I dedicate the rest of my life to all my niggas that passed

And to my mamis on ecstasy
See man, we can bungee in the V.I.P.
We turn bitches out, take turns in that bitch mouth
Carve niggas up, show niggas what it's all about
It's us, the best of Queens, handguns to minks
Top fashion, we flash and bang
Niggas think they Flash Gordon, we snatch the link
Cause we mafioso and you the average dick
Kid, we send messages through bottles
Crash your face with the Mo, have glass all in your nostrils
And run through why y'all niggas like the shits
Kick niggaz with the boots, dukes we get biz, you's a

Trash rap niggaz can't fuck with the...
Exulted, affluent life style I kick
calm shit that make your livest rep want to harm shit
Don't be alarmed when the guns bang (why?)
It's only natural for my dunns to hurt some-thang
Cop a squat though, you might learn some-thang
We givin out back braces and arm slings
Reality rap, the only song I sing
Nuttin fugazi, strictly the real thing
Live in the flesh, my niggaz fresh out the pen
(When you see dem) When I see you dunn, new guns, money ain't a thing
(Money ain't a thing, nigga what, what?)
You could catch me in the clique, in the spot everyday
Nore guzzle the Crist', I down Chardonnay
Pardon me, 'fore you get knocked out the way
Everyday it's like a title fight take place (no doubt)
Aiyyo Nas - fuck that nigga just say? (What he say, huh?)
Aiyya Noyd, tell Manny P. to pass me the shank (shank nigga)
I think it's time to take 'em to the hood, let's play
Ese, I like it when it get that way

So what you rep dunn?
(Iraq, where niggaz burst guns
 and everybody on the block pump junk
 So what you rep dunn?)
Dunn the infamous, Q.B. houses
Where niggaz stand out all night, and make thousands
What you rep?
(Iraq, where niggaz get buried
 And we fight dirty, and stay hungry
 So what you rep dunn?)
Q.B., we like to blow faces
And pop slugs in your illest nigga's rib cages

Aiyyo, yo
Stick it to you, black magic like voodoo
They can't fuck with us, 'cause y'all cats straight doo-doo
(You niggaz stink like shit)
I'm from Iraq, home of the snakes
Niggaz ain't got love for the jakes; do whatever it takes
Climbin down terraces, and the fire escapes
Yo we move money, money move me
Yo I'm usually, livin it up (livin it up nigga what?)
Gettin my dick sucked
Bone a bitch in the butt, make her say what-what

Now gun talk, do you speak the same language?
For your sake, I hope so, let's rap a taste yo
My shit spit like a retard, and plus boss
I drool for the day me and you could face-off
It gets gangster, when my clique step in the room
We blow torches, and celebrate good fortune
This is for my dunns who rest in coffins
I wish why'all was, wish why'all was here

Yo what the deally P? Iraq, can buy out Q.B.
And you know we smash the industry, negatively

A lil' dirt ball nigga, throwin dirt at ya clique
Cause me an Aknel nigga ain't packed no bags
We rather, be in the streets, sellin yellow mesc' tabs
Cause where we from, muh'fucker yo the game don't stops
Or we was, out thuggin yo we had chicken-pox
Me Mus', Maze, Outlaw, +Final Chapter+ brigades
It definitely get real, on stage
I ain't the Madd Rapper, but I'm mad at rap niggaz
They're sellin records yo, actin like they clap niggaz
Cause me and P. get money like L.S.G.
While them cats small change like a E.S.3.
Yo I'm still the same cat, that I used to be
Often, I'm on tour with my rosaries
Coastin, always hit 'em with the thug potion
Look at you now, now you just full emotion
Prankster height, my peoples like the gangster-type
Queens niggaz like to shoot, ain't afraid to fight
While why'all niggaz wear Pampers like the cradle type
Mainly hype, thugged-out, shined with light

Uh-huh, get yours nigga, get yours nigga...
We take yours nigga...

Yo, yo I can see it Dunn, yo let's be it Dunn
and we can manifest all the cash we ever dreamed of
It's the cream I love, for the team I shove
all fakeness and everything else to far away from us

Ain't no discussing for the plush life
My niggas go hard and knock y'all down to survive
In this jungle, wilderness, we was raised
by the wolves and the scavengers, instincts like a animal

But it toughened us, put a whole lot of thug in us
And it paid off, cause can't none of y'all fuck with us
Don't get it twist, I know, anyone can get touched
but uhh - my style of Dunn is too quick to bust

and too swift to just, talk in angles to
Let me straighten that shit out for you, peep it
I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, the best kept secret
We killers, but chill Dunn (shhh) that's best kept secret

Let's not jump off the topic, we talkin' bout cash
Fuckin' with mines will be, much more than your ass
So many years and tears and blood and sweat that fell
This dirt underneath my fingernails speak for itself

I be the same if I had billions
You couldn't understand my pain if you lived it
Give me the riches, and all of my Dunns'll be drivin
It's beautiful to see the click, live comfortable

Dime bags of powder, sack of twenty dollar rocks

I be thuggin', B.G. was raised that way
Can't see me bein' a hoe, you'll get played that way

Black talons go straight through the heart and close shop
I'm a guerilla, I run with jackers and gangsters
Convicted felons, and believe we armed and dangerous

It gets real, I'm prepared for whatever it come to
Let me catch ya with your drawers down, I'ma down you
Police will find you in a project dumpster
With you dick cut off, stuffed in your mouth motherfucker

Naw, you can never feel my pain nigga
And you can never feel my pain nigga
Never feel my pain nigga
How do I start it

Nineteen seventy four, mutherfucker I was born with pain
My moms and my pops pass it down to me
So don't talk to me about can I feel yours
'Cause I ain't feelin' you at all, your pain is impure

You cryin cause you grew from the projects
That's not pain, that's emotions, you a bitch
I'm talkin' bout permanent, physical suffering
You know nothin' about that, you just complain cause you stress

Nigga, my pain's in the flesh
And through the years that pain became my friend; sedated
With Morphine as a little kid
I built a tolerance for drugs, addicted to the medicine

Now hospital emergency treat me like a fiend
I rather die sometimes I wish a nigga O.D.
Beggin' God for help, only to find that I'm all by my god damn self
Ay, You can never feel my pain nigga

[Chorus]

And the females ask...P, why you always look mad
Don't mind me if I may come off like that
But see, a nigga depressed, I need smoke
I need me a drink, I'm tryin' to stop those

Experience life, through the shoes of me
What you find, is you can't do that, you ain't built for it
The impact I put on this earth
Is nothin' like you ever seen or heard; so look listen

When I speak, sit up in your seat
Pay attention to the words, cause the story is deep
In and out of crisis, since before I could walk
It gave me strength though, now a days I hardly talk

It made me cold-hearted, anti, I won't play sports
I barely joke or play games, take it how you want
My handicapped took its toll on my sanity
My moms got me at the shrink at like 13

And doctors called the cops on me
'Cause I be throwin' on [unknown] and they ignore me
I gotta, try to calm down and breathe
I can only hold it but for so long; put me to sleep

Do I sound insane...
If I do, then this here was written for you
'Cause you could never feel the pain nigga

Dunn the streets took my dreams and shattered them
And turn me into a preacher
Minds to money got me not givin' a fuck

All I care about is muzik and who I gotta cut
With the Mac, uzi, .47, pick a weapon
Six million ways to die, my .25 endin'
When I pop him in the gut, I drop him where they stunt

I try keepin' it peace but that shit's for chumps
Projects fucked me up, made me strong as ox
Made the nigga cold blooded, ain't no friends on the block
This the comrades and coldies, the crooked ass police

Playin' cracks in the pocket send you up in creek
Look don't ask me why Queensbridge can't stick together
If you don't know the answer then you don't know the ghetto
Everybody don't get along and that's what it is

They was plottin' on my demise, they wanted my seed
At the head of the table but I'm permanently chief

I don't care how many bodies you got on your gun
You either submit or go and start your own gang son
Everybody wants to be boss, it ain't enough soldiers
Everybody wants to call shots, it ain't enough shooter

And it really hurts my soul that we can't click
But whatever it'll never be the same again
And when I see you niggaz, you already know what it is
And if you don't, you gon' find out the hard way kid
Tried to make it work, but now I'm on some other shit

By myself in my four corner room watchin' Hard Boiled
I feel like I'm crazy, my brain on drugs
My bullet proof on run, flats late at the night

Just ride through his hood and when I see that chump
I'ma jump out the truck and dump my gun
You ain't neva been do it so you scared of that kinda shit

I really go through it in interrogation rooms
I don't crack, nigga, I don't got none for ya

Be careful where you pull that trigger, they got you on film
They got eyes in the sky, we under surveillance

Gotta watch what I say, they tappin' my cell phone
They wanna sneak and peak inside of my home
I'm paranoid and it's not the weed
In my rear view mirror these cars, they follow me

So I bust rights and lefts, lefts and rights
Till I stop seeing those Impala headlights
Then I circle my block to make sure it's smooth

You never looked as lost as this
Sometimes it doesn't even look like you
It goes dark
It goes darker still
Please stay
But I watch you like I'm made of stone
As you walk away...

I'm coming to find you if it takes me all night
A witch hunt for another girl
For always and ever is always for you
Your trust
The most gorgeously stupid thing I ever cut in the world

Say hello on a day like today
Say it everytime you move
The way that you look at me now
Makes me wish I was you
It goes deep
It goes deeper still
This touch
And the smile and the shake of your head...

Trying to get me some sunshine
An avoid the patrol
Ah yea

I'm fed up
All I want is a little nice weather when I get
A lot of people arrive zealous
But life here's, less than a dream, more a nightmare
Welcome to the city of gold, the city I roam
Home to the grittiest roads
It's hardly a party, getting our p's
On the same corner where women sell narni
I live amongst vermin I'm stuck
But I couldn't give a, fuck as long as I'm earning
Long been accustomed to the ways of the manor
The filth are an occupational hazard
Parked chilling in a car park grinning
It's gone midnight an I'm half past sinning
Got a dark heart wicked with my ras clart lyrics

More like the city of sin

From villainous nippers to city slickers with sinister grins
Straight, ain't religous, never been into hymns
An I pushed bars before I'd ever been in a gym
So for my freedom I keep hoping
Cause I don't wanna walk through the doors these keys open

But I can show you a different side to London
To think you came here for the treasure?
But nobody ever came here for the weather

For the wage of sin
Even if by some poor sod's loss
I care not I will take the win
Many came so full of hope
Only to be deflated
The roads we walk ain't paved in gold
Alone is how our days spent
Don't think cause I'm polite that I'm nice g
Or cause I'm well dressed I ain't grimy
I got food for them city heads
Just another aggie yout that the city bread

I'd rather leave you, than insult you with the lies, 'cause I'm really not as sly as to deceive you.

Professor Green,"Yogi man, I'm sick of this shit bruv, swear down. Just as things start looking up, it all goes to shit again story of my fucking life.

I don't wanna live my life this way. No!
Picture me behind a desk, picture that a nine to five I ain't into that, I'm into rap and I don't see me getting an office job with these tat's.
So what choice do I have man? Do I sign on or do I bag grams? Long signing for dole, I wanna get signed for my flow and my rhymes.
I'm a pro and I'm nice I know, if I grind then I'll blow so why am I wasting time on the roads.
Now Mike's interested I should probably give it a rest before I get arrested, but then I got arrested whoops.

[Chorus]
Why don't I learn from my mistakes? Why oh why oh why.. All I want's to change my ways Why oh why oh why Do I always end up back here, stuck on the wrong side of town.
With my head spinning I keep on falling down.

Never been arrested for so much as an eighth of weed and I get arrested for kidnap, blackmail, false imprisonment and possession with intent to supply.
Typical of my fuckin' luck really innit, just as I'm about to sign a deal with Mike I might be doing a fucking bird.

I don't wanna sell weed no more, hated the cycle but I kept peddling.
Nan just found food under my bed again, I'm a let down again, And she's screaming ""get this shit out of my house"" again.
There's no curving the truth, the bags too big to be for personal use, there's no excuses she knows what the truth is.
I do flip Keys of green to get me a few quid.
She's looking at me so disappointed, all I can say is I wont do it again, but she knows I will..

[Chorus]

Never learn man. There's no plan B for me, I ain't got shit to fall back on! I left school in year 8 I don't have an education, selling weed and writing lyrics is all I know.

I got arrested and raided then I got signed and I bust case so now everything's fine.
But now everything's not, not only did I get dropped the whole label did, and I wasted my advance so I ain't got shit.
I'm stuck at warners and them pricks wont push my album, but it's cool; as soon as I'm free I'm gonna do it without them.
Eight months later I'm still stuck in my deal, in debt with my lawyer time to get back on this ferris wheel.
I'm stuck on this carousel when will this ever end!?
This is hell for me I'm back at the beginning again! Somebody please get me off this circus ride
The horse that I'm riding is hurting my thighs erm..

[Chorus]

And before some funny guy tries to make a joke about me riding a horse, it is a metaphor! What I mean is I am sick of hustling, I am sick of the grind, I am sick of things going to shit, Just when things are looking up! I don't know if this shit is ever gonna work for me. I swear down blud I am so fed up Yogi, I cannot be dealing with it anymore.",Falling Down
Professor Green,"I kick flows, rips shows, think it switched though. Shit no, it aint any different when I get home.
I shift po to get dough, lust P's.
If you ain't ever been broke? For you to judge me's an insult.
It's my life an' I'm living it, agreed we all have choices but mine limited mostly by my decisions.

If I new then what I new now, I'd a lived life different, I'd be a different me, but I didn't so this is me.
Me, in my position what would you have done? Would you of done what I did? Am I what you would of become?

My guess, my guess is you would of succumb like I did.
The decision was mine, but I was too young an' I picked the wrong path, I went the wrong way.
Left school then got the grade, banged it out, got my pape's.
Stacked my p's copped a cake, I'm holding weight now, made a brick of a ounce an' ain't been in the 
jail house.

I intend on staying free, free for me don't mean free from stress.
Lay in bed but I ain't asleep, from I need rest I just blaze the trees.
Drift off hearing my Nan say to me...

[Chorus]
Goodnight God bless I'll see you in the morning. Goodnight God bless I'll see you in the morning.

I'm a dreamer but can only dream as long as I'm asleep,. I've been having trouble sleeping.
See Nanny Edie aint here to say goodnight no more, I had to say goodbye to her, inside is where resides the hurt.
Now all I feel is pain, after that nothingness. After that? Nothing since, after that there's nothing left.

Some of her last words were, I cant fight forever. Like she wanted to give up an' of life she was fed up.
She had to go, but I wanted her to stay, 'cause ever since she left things haven't been the same.
I need a new shelter from the rain, my face looking weathered, a facety looking bredder I'm fed up.
I know not what to do, see I'd love to say that I don't give a fuck but I do.

The gift an' curse that I'm blessed with, the pressures on road ain't nothing to the emotions that I wrestle with.
Stress got me in a figure four, raw is what I'm thinking, I wonder what I'm living for?
Is it only to hurt? First my Great Nan, now I gotta put my dad in the dirt.
Back in the earth, I wished we could have patched it up first, I was so angry though I just 
couldn't handle the hurt.

Now your in the back of a hearse. It hurts more than it ever did.
Sometimes I wish that I had never lived. Feels as if it would be better if if never did, live.
I don't know how I'm ever gonna get through this, shit.
I swear down blud I'm running on empty, My life ain't nothing to be envied.
So Goodnight",Goodnight

It's wild round 'ere, you don't wanna spend a night round 'ere.
When your out here in this jungle, ain't nothing nice round 'ere,

But you keep asking for trouble, you love?
You love when trouble comes your way, your way, your way.

Welcome to Hackney
A place where I think somebody's been playing Jumanji.
A Manor where man are like animals,
An' they'll yam on you like they yam on food.
Cats with claws that'll stab a yout', act bad an' catch a slap or two.
We don't applaud success, all we clap are tools.
London ain't cool to cruise through where the hunters pray,
Looking lunch today,
And your chains looking like fresh fruit to a hungry ape.
They'll eat on you, then laugh about it like Hyenas do,
So stick to breezing through, like cheeta's do or be a piece of food.

When your out here in this jungle.
It's wild round 'ere, you don't wanna spend a night round 'ere.
When your out here in this jungle, aint nothing nice round 'ere,
Troubles what you find round 'ere.
When your out here in this jungle, in this jungle.
Your always caught in this struggle, in this jungle .
But you keep asking for trouble, you love?
You love when trouble comes your way, your way, your way.

It's blitz amidst the strife here,
Got kids with sticks and knifes here.
It's hype here, we know no different prick;
It's just life here, life the way we know from young the way we're shown.
Stacked trapped in flats where our front doors don't face the road.
God CID spinning round in cars, shifting criminals at large, it's hard,
Not to think the bits are just a bing without the bars.
Jealousy's what the cheddar brings, for the cheddar it's anything goes,
Low enough to rob newly weds for their wedding rings
Everyday is warring, never give a warning,
Violence is the only way you settle things, everyday is hating,
Money that I'm making, jealous 'cause I'm moving on to better things,
Everyday is fighting, rolling in the night now.
All you do is watch everyone else get far, you say that life is hard
When your out here in this jungle.
It's wild round 'ere, you don't wanna spend a night round 'ere.
When your out here in this jungle, ain't nothing nice round 'ere,
Troubles what you find round 'ere.

I just might let you in see, I'm quite closed off,
I got a lot of pain inside, that's why I get high till I dose off but,
I change in time at least I hope to, cause it feels so right when I hold you,
I wanna get inside I wanna know you, there's so much of I, I wanna show you
And though I'm scared to, I'm prepared to, trust you as long as you share too.
Lucked up, both loved up, but little did we know we were both fucked up
The more open we were the more vulnerable, but after a while weren't fun at all

I loved you and now it's too late to say to you.
Just didn't know what to do or how to deal with it,
Even now deep down I'm still livid.
To think, I used to blame me,
I wonder what I did to you to make you hate me.
I wasn't even bad, life's a journey and mine wasn't an easy ride.
You never even got to see me rap,
I just wish you woulda reached out,
I wish you woulda been round when I been down.

Wherever you are I really hope you found peace.

Unlike you I'll never let them be without me.

Professor Green,"She was on her way home he was lying away, 
Assistance from others had never led her astray, 
She had a good day, 
Was persuaded by summer air to walk instead of getting the train, 
The decision so innocent as innocent as she, 
Uncorrupted so innocent and sweet 
An innocence interrupted by an incident 
A ? in two people so different in belief 
She came from the depths and ascend, bumped into he who dement, 
Intent on inflicting the same pain that been led 
The decision made by he for she had never consented. 
And unprovoked the most venomous attack, 
He took from her that which she can't get back, 
And left her with that that she can't get rid of 
Which is why whenever it's time for lift out 

She builds a rocket out of stars in her spoon, 
Straps up, the only way to make it to the moon, 
Dear god, I hope you haven't forgot 
This young brave astronaut 
A habit she never wanted, 
A pain she needed numbing, 
And she'd rather feel nothing than the pain 
An evening she can't forget, 
Memories she can't stomach 
Not for nothing but I need a inner vain 
Friends she ignored till the phone stopped ringing, 
Till her door stopped knocking, 
Her door she only opens to let him in, 
But she has no money so she lets him come 
You can take that either away 

A window she rarely opens so she can see the day, 
Her stove she only uses to heat her spoon, 
For her the only way she can reach the moon. 
She builds a rocket out of stars in her spoon, 
Straps up, the only way to make it to the moon, 
Dear god, I hope you haven't forgot

Looking up, looking up, looking up for the young brave astronaut 
Give it up, give it up, give it up for the young brave astronaut 
I know that you're busy but any time you got, 
God please make a visit, 
To the young, to the young, to the young, 
To the young brave astronaut 

She opens the window for a glimpse out 
And heats a spoon over the stove 
Feels a familiar sting and then slips out 
With a window that isn't quite closed 
With the window open and the stove still lit, 
Along with the rain came a gust of wind, 
Which blew the fire out, 
Gas still running and her still breathing the gas in.

Upper Clapton, Hackney
How old were you when you first started rapping?
I was 18
Who are your major influences?
Are you serious? Your Mum)

I ain't answering anymore of your questions, 
You know what? I have a question
Who's idea was it to get in the charts, 
By rhyming over Hungarian dance music
Why would I make dance music, when I can't dance to it?
I'm the anecdote to that shit, bringing back strap shit, 
Soon as I'm done calling this bulimic a fat bitch
I'll be saving the day on renegade with the dog, 
Playing fetch watching him chase a grenade
Maybe I should play the same game with Bruno, 
If I ever again get mistaken for a cluedo, 
Character I'm gonna have to unleash my Mitch a judo, 
I just took a shit and now I can't find any loo roll.

I do squat diddily and do more than you do when you do lots, do lots.
Do women do for me what they did not do, 
Maybe it's got something to do with my new watch.

Why would I beat around the bush or take the scenic route, 
When I'm a meanie, born to instigate fumes, I'm the morning, 
Midday and evening news, and I started a trend Mike got his teeth fixed to.
If you're wondering where I've been out, 
Kicked back with a six-pack, of becks on a bench,
Sunbathing in a hijab, give me a tic-tac, I just had a pack of Nik Naks, 
Thanks now I'll turn you into a kebab with my pick-axe.
Mish, mash, mosh-pit, whenever I drop shit, it's hot shit, 
I just won a race with an ostrich.
Obnoxious, preposterous, looney a damn nutter, 
If I ever see Rooney anywhere near my Grandmother ah!
I live life without an ounce of logic, 
I like my wrist so much I spent a house deposit on it.

Then I broke a bowl and hope the Hospital gives me morphine.

Went against odds when I was short and soldiers,
I asked not for my burden to be lightened
But if I may have broader shoulders
So as I may carry the weight all the doubt I had in me has been ?
So from now til the day I'm carried away
I will never walk around what stands in my way
Fuck if they ain't letting off cos neither will I
When I die from the ashes any ?
Long as my ? and my faith keep me alive
Fear is something you will see in my eyes.

We'll be kings forever, oh oh oh,
Holding on together, oh oh oh,
Feeling so much better oh oh oh,
When everything was wrong and everything was gone
We ran to Avalon.

I left competion out for the count no abacus
Fought for the crowd, fought down challengers
When my massacre was ordained
I remained through pain forged my sword, my Excalibur.

Feeling so much better oh oh oh,

Professor Green,"I don't know how long I can remain composed
All I did was say a flow, and now my father's always told
You should play your part, but I never said I'd take the role
Now every fucking thing I say's a quote
And they catch you out a convict, I'd be lying if I said I was not vexed,
Pick up a paper flick a page and see a picture of me on my latest conquest
Fuck it, it all helped
I'm not just gonna stand here making out its all hell
And all's well and good if I put on a pair of rose ticks
Yeah bare arms, just to show ink
My show in croft, but I'm not showing off,
I would be if I were to let you know what this costs
Now before ya I'm more subtle than I am flashy though init man
Just know if you don't see it on the wrist it's in the bank
On a mission with a plan, life's a journey and I don't wanna end up in a jam
Where I end up in the hands, of the Gods, when I'm gone, I'll be going with a bang

I'm up high and I like life up here, you're running behind

They're taming me like I'm their doll

I'm in the mood, in a feud with myself
The chair's wobbling, and my neck is in the news
See what I do, I don't ever get to choose
And today has been a few too many interviews
I mean can I breathe? This new attitude,
Is probably gonna leave a lot of people mad at me
Hater life to-be, I'll be glad to see some anarchy
It wasn't the money that changed me it was the lack of sleep
To get to sleep I need more than a bag of weed
What happened last year? I can't even remember back a week
Just became a blur, don't believe everything you've heard
Although I heard Peter Burns just became a 'her'
All these people sucking me and telling me that I'm the shit
Ain't any less annoying than those who told me that I should quit
Do it I said fuck it I shall win, chucking it all in,
I ain't a fucking puppet on a string

You know, that, I've always believed that you should learn to tolerate ?

Professor Green,"Never needed a hand nope, I did it all alone
With no dad to make a man of me, I did it on my own
A victim, a condition now I'm conditioned for the cold
Even though I know what's missing there's no feeling in this home
Escaped it, a whole leap of problems, isolating instead of facing
I always attract the women who think that I need saving
Even though I'm the only person I can put any faith in
Face it, I'm chained in and happily so,
What would I have to hold it if I let all the anarchy go?
Can't take the praise, I just climb my patrol,
Just know I better deal with hatred and handle it so

My back against the wall, there's nowhere else to go
And I can't hear you calling, who's gonna catch me when I fall?
(Who's gonna) Catch me when I fall?
And I'm forever falling
Who's gonna catch me when I fall?

See what I got in this world?
That's how come I can't sleep without poppin a pill
Felt it come back up but I'm still down,
Just back to convincing myself that I'm ill now
See with me the stress manifest isn't it,
Still in me is this ray of happiness and its killing me
I cant control it yet I worry about things that are out of my control and I'm folded
I ain't never letting this introvert out,
In a lonely home that could have been but isn't our house
But I ain't in the mood to have any visitors round
So I hide away, my curtains been drawn so long
I couldn't tell you if its night or day
So how I feel is the only way that I can hide the pain
People try and help but I shy away but a problem shared is a problem heard
But I care for you too much to make this problem ours
Who knows where this problem starts
Come on Steve and get to mine,
You're not scared it's something I'm man enough to be
Or even you get be, how am I meant to handle what I see
When they just found my daddy hanging from a tree

My back against the wall, there's nowhere else to go
I can't hear you calling, who's gonna catch me when I fall?
Catch me when I fall?
And I'm forever falling
Who's gonna catch me when I fall?

Trying to find myself
I don't know where to go from here
Losing my strength
So save me again

My back against the wall, there's nowhere else to go
I can't hear you calling, who's gonna catch me when I fall?
Catch me when I fall?
And I'm forever falling
Who's gonna catch me when I fall?

So save me again

Professor Green,"This is stressing me
Its really beginning to get to me
You've always been the best to me
And I've never given you any less of me
You've never been in a negative energy
I'm stressing, you tell me never to let it get to me
Theres never been another next to me, that means what you meant to me
I said meant, but thats mean, i meant mean to me not meant to me!
but I don't know if its meant to be
I wanna tell you but nothings coming out when I speak
I cant find the words to say, its like the words evade me

I'm struggling to find a way to word it, and I'm supposed to be a wordsmith

I was selling white, you were telling me i could do better
I told you if I was you I'd leave but you never,
Forever had faith in me even when i never did
I said I'd never let her slip like her ex-fella did
Been tryin' to disguise it and dress it up,
I wanna tell her but i cant bear to see her welling up
I've got to find the strength to let her know, I've got to find the strength to let her go
But if I let her go I'll never know if things will get better with her,
See this could be a hiccup and not the end of the road
I'd be better to never get involved, she deserves better
than a fella with a fear of being alone

But I cant help the way I feel, I really can't pretend
I cant help the way I feel, but I don't want us to end
'Cause it will never be enough for us to just be friends

Nah, it'll never be enough
'Cause I think we both know what it means for us
I see the look on your face and I hate it
But I finally pluck up enough courage to say it
That's when she spins me around and tells me I ain't leaving
To tell her I take it back to tell her that I don't mean it
To look her dead in the eye and tell her I don't feel it
But I don't feel it

Expectations to get rep

Only thing was I never saw enough of you.
The last thing I said to you was I hated you,
I loved you and now it's too late to say to you.
Just didn't know what to do or how to deal with it,
Even now deep down I'm still livid.
To think, I used to blame me,
I wonder what I did to you to make you hate me.
I wasn't even bad, life's a journey and mine wasn't an easy ride.
You never even got to see me rap,
I just wish you woulda reached out,
I wish you woulda been round when I been down.
I wish that you could see me now,
Wherever you are I really hope you found peace.
But know that if I ever have kids,
Unlike you I'll never let them be without me.

Everything I have I give to you
In every one of these lines I sing to you.

My life just became yours to read and interpret.
If you heard it will come across a lot different at times
I throw fits when I read how they word things.

Now you're gonna have to see me hurt

Used to be a dream but now I fucking live it
Weren't even writing raps I was down and out about to fucking quit it
Lucky for me that I fucking didn't
See lily came along when I was at my lowest
Selling wraps of coke not the raps I flow with
I made it and I owe to a chat I had with her,
Who knows where I'd be if that chat hadn't occurred
Back with the bag, with the bag full of herbs in it
Instead I got her on a track and I murdered it
My name started causing murmurs in the industry
But none of these labels would work with it until virgin did
Put my first single out and we earned a hit
That's why we never ?
I know it must burn a bit
Just did a show and everybody knew the words to it
The day I risked everything for I couldn't have given 
Anything more all these years away everything
But this is something that nothing could have readied me for
What you think all my problems are remedied cos' I get an applause, there not

My single went in at 3
My album went in at 2
For a debut not to shabby if I have to I make do
Finally some form of reward for the things I came through
But it's different to the perfect picture people paint you
On the way up you might be a person people take to
Then you break through and the same people who rated you hate too
All of a sudden anything you may do may make news
And I'm sick to death of explaining what is ain't true
Spend a day in my shoes and maybe you would feel the same too
Though I know I've got to make the most of it there will be no take 2
And I'm grateful I would hate to see 'em cos' I'm leaving my dream now
But I don't sleep now
And all these hours awake are making me senile

Even people I've been round my whole life are looking at me like I'm a new me now
They say I've changed but I just don't see how

All I've done is what I've had to do
Been who I've had to be
But the path I've walked has been so gravely
It's been a strain to remain human amongst all this inhumanity
Thankfully I had nan who was a mum and a dad to me
You can choose your friends but you can't choose your family
Temporary happiness for me has been a fallacy
?
Sick of hearing how happy I should be
I just don't know how to be
I can no longer pretend
No more making out to be
Maybe all I needs a slap,
Someone to shake it out of me
Help me to spell my irrational thoughts think more rationally
Sick of being in the state of vanity
It's agony
Am I torn or is it all some twisted form of vanity
Can it be I'm really just obsessed with myself, 
Obsessive compulsive depressed, my pressures reflecting my health
Taking care of my career but I'm neglecting myself
Rejected therapy no I just won't except any help
I pride myself on my honestly but in all honestly today I lied
I was asked how I was and I said I was fine, I'm not

Too busy to reminisce over a time when you have time
And all you wanna do is chill, baby hold onto

Cocktails to cigarette butts and champagne flutes

A plane I've gotta catch and a bed I don't wanna leave
I don't wanna leave you, I wanna wake you
But I should let you sleep through, you look so peaceful
Tiptoeing as I'm rushing to get my things together
Too many pieces of puzzles for me to piece together
Maybe I'll leave a letter, in the hope that
When she wakes, she remembers me and that we fell asleep together
But likely she remembered nothing
Woke up in a rush and huffing at how Stephen kept her knocking
Grabbed her things, didn't see the letter, let alone open it
Stepped over it on her way out and never even noticed it

Think to yourself, what would I have done?
Somebody popped my watch and then tried to run
We got in a tussle, all the while
I had no idea where my wife had gone, plus I'm poignant on
Whether he's got a gun or a knife on him
Not knowing if her life was in
Danger why I tried to hold on to the watch and fight the.
Then I heard her scream, so I'm guessing he bought more guys with him
Fuck the watch, my priority's Millie now
You think what I did was so silly now you've figured it out?
Worked out the reason for me getting into the whip
Not only is this dickhead who got me kicked
And gotten away with my watch, he's gone and gotten me in all of this shit
Shame I never caught up to him in the whip, eh?

It is not a shame that I didn't catch up

Hello babe, what's happening, you cool?
(Ah yeah you alright? What's happening?)
Yeah I'm good, what's going on?
(Yeah, nothing er chillin')
Alright, what you up to later?
(Oh yeah about that, um,
D'ya know what I'm really busy can I call you back?)
This ain't so stereotypical man, not for a stereotypical man, 
It should be me that wants to get rid of you 
Instead it's you that don't give a damn (what?)
It was meant to be a one night ting, 
Nothing more than a little one night fling, 
Now when I'm in need you're the one I ring I

But she's playing hard to get, 
Brunette with such class she's hard to forget, 
See at first I wasn't after her heart 
But I couldn't stop thinking about her after I left
I'm beginning to lose my cool, 
It appears in love I have fallen (whoops)
I'm ready to put my all in and all she does is ignore my calls

She's everything I want, 
But all that I don't need
How can she be so hot, 
Yet be so cold to me
How can it be so wrong, 
And yet it feels so right
I wish I never, but I need you tonight

This lady is driving me crazy, 
She blows hot and cold like the AC
I just can't figure her out 
Next time I'm with her I'm pinning her down (Oi) 
I'm gonna find out if she's on it or not (not, not) 
'Cause all of this shit is long (long, long) 
See I front like I'm okay but I'm not, 
I'm being played at my own game and it's long (long blud)
I ain't no idiot, I'm pro 
I'm no intermediate so next time she phones me 
I ain't even gonna pick up the phone to speak in it (ring) 
Nope, swear down, (ring) wait a minute, that's her now

(Hello?)
(I really wanna see you today)
(Alright, just give me a time and a place and I'm there)

I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you
I need you, I want you
Won't stop until I've got you
There's nothing that I won't do
I need you tonight

Look, I ain't never been the type to be this (no) 
I ain't never been the type to be with, 
She's exposing a side of me that,
I'm trying to fight, I'm trying to hide my pride, 
I'm trying to find it,

Professor Green,"I felt like I was going crazy
Thought I was losing my mind, I did
I even convinced myself it was all in my mind, all of this time
I think it's high time
That some truth comes of this lie I've lived
We've lived or we live together
At least we did when we were together
All of the things that we did together
Tainted, jaded
The first sign of temptation, you gave in
First heard when you tripped up, stumbled over
And did something that I'd never even contemplated
Stick your story, save it
Whether it was a mistake, or were you sober
Or were you wasted?
Did you show him all of your little faces?

If everyone knows
Why ain't nobody telling me, telling me?

Found out all your little secrets
Uncovered all your little lies
The amount of times you'd had me believe it
You were pulling the wool over my eyes (my eyes)
I found out all your little secrets (my eyes)
Uncovered all your little lies
And now I'm starting to put all the pieces
Together in my mind, together in my mind

Did I ask too much of you?
Did I expect too much?
Could I have given you a little extra?
Would it have made you a little less of a strut?
And you walk wherever you walk
Dress barely holding on for the ride
Guess I knew we'd always end premature
I can't say it didn't come as a surprise
So tell me, was it good, was it?
Was it worth it? Did you work it?
Would you be as kind as to
Tell me what it was I did to you to deserve it?
'Cause nah, I ain't perfect
But I ain't ever shown nobody where you sleep
Are you gonna have somebody in my bed?
Guess I better get new sheets

Professor Green,"All the time I have laid in your love
When your love kept me safe through the night
All the time I was sure you were mine
And before time demands our goodbye
Can you sing me a last lullaby?

It's been a while since I last dreamt
Barely remember what it's like to dream
Finding it hard to get to sleep, too stressed
And there ain't anyone to sing a lullaby to me
Pretend shit doesn't get to me
And I suffer in silence when I'm hurting
A man's problems are his own
And it's my burden
Tossing and turning, trying to get to sleep
But I find it hard to switch off when my mind's working
I ponder on things I shouldn't ponder on
Off the rails, my train of thought's wandering
Sick of pretending to be so happy
All the while my anxiety's away at me
My skin crawling, I look up to the sky
And it falls, the walls close in and it's
As if all the good in my life disappears
In an instant, that thing is just so distant
So seeing the ones who I love, the ones who love me
But I don't wanna tell em how I feel in case they judge me
It's just me, wish I could let somebody in
But I ain't ever been too trusting

All the time I have laid in your love
When your love kept me safe through the night
All the time I was sure you were mine
And before time demands our goodbye
Can you sing me a last lullaby?

I've barely had any sleep when I get up
Sick of all these nightmares and these night terrors
Like it's only when I'm in heaven that I sleep better
Might sleep better when I get up, I'm weak
It just makes my day harder, I wonder if
It would've been any different if I had a father that I knew
Could it have helped shape the way that I grew?
But the point of things I never have went from
Being a reason for the things that I do
To just being an excuse that I'd use
I've gotta take responsibility for the things I do
Find something other than negativity for my fuel
But I feed off it, even when I don't seem bothered
I hide everything that's going on inside
Guess it's been a while since I've been honest, I need help
But I deny it and even lie to myself like I'm fine

All the time I have laid in your love
When your love kept me safe through the night
All the time I was sure you were mine
And before time demands our goodbye
Can you sing me a last lullaby?

I just wish someone would tell me it would be OK
But pessimism leads me to believe that it won't
To see even a glimmer of hope in the darkness
Is hard and depression is a slippery slope
I don't wanna do what my dad did with a rope, though
So I carry on even though it's hard to
The only thing that's definite is death and things always change
As long as you give em a chance to

All the time I have laid in your love
When your love kept me safe through the night
All the time I was sure you were mine
And before time demands our goodbye
Can you sing me a last lullaby?

(Can you sing me a last lullaby?)

All the time I have laid in your love
When your love kept me safe through the night
All the time I was sure you were mine
And before time demands our goodbye

Professor Green,"I gave you my everything, 
Guess that didn't mean anything to you
'Cause I'm not your man
All the nights I spent with you not making love, just making do
Oh, I'm not your man

I'm swimming way out of my depth
I'm in way over my head
I wish she never showed me her bed, bed, bed
I wish I could forget

What you take me for?
What you take me for?
Gave you everything
Yet you're still looking at me like
I could've gave you more, gave you more?
I ain't got anything left to give, 
Somebody better know if I'm the next of kin
'Cause the stress is killing me, 
Either you're feeling me or not
Either way I ain't gonna be spending any more money on Tiffany
I'm done with that, what do you think I rap for?
To buy you a bag? Are you mad?
I'm a catch, the type of man women normally go mad for
Sick of love, sick of you, 
Wish I was but I ain't though
Changed like a boy in trance, anything that you ask for
I can't say no, don't give but you take loads
The dinners and taxis, 
I ain't ever been attracted to anybody as much
I am in love with you so madly, ain't ever treated you badly
But no matter what I do, you're unhappy

""Bills, Bills, Bills"", bet you liked that though

Gave you a key to the crib only to find
Your you when I came home
A temptress, a seductress
Who possessed enough perzazz to make me obsessed
When you undress you wanna compete, sorry I didn't know
It was a contest, but guess I won
'Cause I came first, is that the reason that you're upset?
Why would you keep coming back 
If it's just sex if it ain't no good?
Or is it the rest that you're interested in?
All of the spending in the restaurants
I gave you everything that you ever wanted 
And what did I get in return for it?
Laboutin, Louis Vuitton, your shoes cost more than
I used to earn in a month back when I used to sleep on a futon

Over hearts, I have painfully
Turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what
I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me
Now to find
The love that I sought can never
Be mine

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

And though the odds
Say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you
Will find
You too like I
Overjoyed, over loved, over
You, over you",Overjoyed

I just never would suspect a thing
'Til that little bell began to ring in my head

But I tried to run,
though I knew it wouldn't help me none

were just something I never knew

Silence me, prescribe me your cancer
If I will disappear, you'll silence me
I'll welcome the virus

Don't bore me with what's real
