Chet Baker,"They're writing songs of love
But not for me
A lucky star's above
But not for me
With love to lead the way
I've found more clouds of grey
Than any Russian play could guarantee
I was a fool to fall and get that way
Heigh-ho! Alas! And also, lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss
I guess she's not for me

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Heigh-ho! Alas! And also, lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss
I guess she's not for me",But Not for Me
Chet Baker,"I get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except when soft rains fall
And drip from leaves, then I recall
The thrill of being sheltered in you arms
Of course I do
But I get along without you very well

I've forgotten you just like I should
Of course I have
Except to hear your name or someone's laugh
That is the same
But I've forgotten you just like I should

What a guy, what a fool am I
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon
What's in store, should I phone once more?
No, it's best that I stick to my tune

I get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except perhaps in spring, but I should
Never think of spring
For that would surely break my heart in two",I Get Along Without You Very Well
Chet Baker,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day
Chet Baker,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me! 

I love all, the many charms about you!
Above all, I want my arms about you! 

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!",Embraceable You
Chet Baker,"Magic mirror come and search my heart
Can you tell me what you see
There's a thousand voices whispering
Songs and you're the melody

So I imagine my heart with you
See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive
Love ecstasy imagining you with me

Many, many days our shadows passed
Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light
And that morning light is you
So I imagine my heart with you

See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive 
love ecstasy imagining you, imagining me
The beauty we both can see

You're the dream I prayed would come along
To make my fantasy
Day and night you live inside my heart
You're the flame of love to me
",Imagination
Chet Baker,"Long ago my heart and mind
Got together and designed
The wonderful girl for me
Oh what a fantasy

Thought the ideal of my heart
Can't be ordered a la carte
I wonder if she will be
Always a fantasy

Will I ever find the girl in my mind?
The one who is my ideal
Maybe she's a dream and yet she might be
Just around the corner waiting for me

Will I recognize the light in her eyes
That no other eyes reveal
Or will I pass her by and never even know
That she was my ideal

Will I recognize the light in her eyes
That no other eyes reveal
Or will I pass her by and never even know
That she is my ideal",My Ideal
Chet Baker,"Oh, there's a lull in my life 
It's just a void and empty space 
When you are not in my embrace
Oh, there's a lull In my life 
The moment that you go away 
There is no night, there is no day
The clock stops ticking
The world stops turning
Everything stops but the flame in my heart 
That keeps burning, burning
Oh, oh, oh
There's a lull In my life 
No matter how I may pretend
I know that you alone can end",There's a Lull in My Life
Chet Baker,"Once I had a secret love,
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love,
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Now, I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore.",Secret Love
Chet Baker,"What's new?
How is the world treating you?
You haven't changed a bit
Handsome as ever I must admit

What's new?
How did that romance come through?
We haven't met since then
Gee, but it's nice to see you again

What's new?
Probably I'm boring you
But seeing you is grand
And you were sweet to offer your hand
I understand

Adieu
Pardon my asking what's new
Of course you couldn't know
I haven't changed
I still love you so

Adieu
Pardon my asking what's new
Of course you couldn't know
I haven't changed
I still love you so",What's New?
Chet Baker,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!
Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the stars",Stairway to the Stars
Chet Baker,"No tears, no fears
Remember there's always tomorrow
So what if we have to part
We'll be together again

Your kiss, your smile
Are memories I'll treasure forever
So try thinking with your heart
We'll be together again

[Chorus]
Times when I know you'll be lonesome
Times when I know you'll be sad
Don't let temptation surround you
Don't let the blues make you bad

Some day, some way
We both have a lifetime before us
For parting is not goodbye
We'll be together again

[Chorus]",We'll Be Together Again
Chet Baker,"Every time you're near a rose
Aren't you glad you've got a nose
And if the dawn is fresh with dew
Aren't you glad you're you

When a meadowlark appears
Aren't you glad you've got two ears
And if your heart is singin' too
Aren't you glad you're you

You can see a summer sky
Or touch a friendly hand
Or taste an apple pie
Pardon the grammar, but ain't life grand

And when you wake up each morn
Aren't you glad that you were born
Think what you've got the whole day through
Aren't you glad you're you

Every time you're near a rose
Aren't you glad you've got a nose
And if the dawn is fresh with dew
Aren't you glad you're you

And if your heart is singin' too

Aren't you glad you're you",Aren't You Glad You're You
Chet Baker,"Let's get lost
Lost in each other's arms
Let's get lost
Let them send out alarms

And though they'll think us rather rude
Let's tell the world we're in that crazy mood
Let's defrost in a romantic mist
Let's get crossed off everybody's list
To celebrate this night we've found each other
Mm, let's get lost

Chet Baker,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear

Chet Baker,"Somewhere, someday
Well be close together, wait and see
Oh by the way,
This time the dreams on me

You take my hand
And you look at me adoringly
But as things stand
This time the dreams on me

It would be fun
To be certain that I'm the one
To know that I, at least, supply the shoulder you cry upon

To see you through
Till you're everything you want to be
It can't be true, but
This time the dreams on me

It would be fun
To be certain that I'm the one
To know that I, at least, supply the shoulder you cry upon

To see you through
Till you're everything you want to be
It can't be true, but
This time the dreams on me",This Time the Dream's on Me
Chet Baker,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream  to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill like I had never known
You smiled, when you smiled at me that was how the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
I found my love at last",At Last

Chet Baker,"Long ago my heart and mind

Chet Baker,"When they met, the way they smiled, I saw that I was through
Oh, you crazy moon, what did you do?
And when they kissed, 
They tried to say that it was just in fun
Oh, you crazy moon, look what you've done

Once you promised me, you know, that it would never end
You should be ashamed to show your funny face, my friend

There they are, they fell in love, 
I guess you think that you're smart
Oh, you crazy moon, you broke my heart

Chet Baker,"Daybreak, another new day
The mist on the meadow is drifting away
For it's daybreak, the sun's in the sky now
And flowers break through their blanket of dew

Sunrise, how lovely it seems
To see from my window a sky full of dreams
As the white clouds sail on through blue
At daybreak, I daydream of you",Daybreak
Chet Baker,"Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last
Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Chills run up and down my spine

Chet Baker,"Dream beside me in the midnight glow, the lamp Is low
Dream and watch the shadows came and go, the lamp Is low
While you linger in my arms, my lips will sigh ""I love you so"" 
Dream the sweetest dream will ever know
Tonight the moon is high, the lamp Is low

The thrill is gone
I can see it in your eyes
I can hear it in your sighs
Feel your touch and realize
The thrill is gone

The nights are cold
For love is old
Love was grand when love was new
Birds were singing, skies were blue
Now it don't appeal to you

Chet Baker,"You better go now
Because I like you much, too much
You have a way with you
You ought to know now
Just why I like you very much
The night was gay with you

There's the moon above
And it gives my heart a lot of swing
In your eyes there's love
And the way I feel it must be Spring
I want you so now
You have the lips I love to touch
You better go now

Chet Baker,"The song a robin sings,
Through years of endless springs,
The murmur of a brook at evening tides.
That ripples through a nook where two lovers hide.

That great symphonic theme,
That's Stella by starlight,
And not a dream,
My heart and I agree,
She's everything on this earth to me.

Chet Baker,"Whenever it's early twilight
I watch 'til a star breaks through
Funny, it's not a star I see
It's always you

Whenever I roam through roses
And lately I often do
Funny, it's not a rose I touch
It's always you

If a breeze caresses me
It's really you strolling by
If I hear a melody

Chet Baker,"Say, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be

Chet Baker,"Say, have you seen a Carioca
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Now you'll dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You'll dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone and we're saying goodbye
Goodbye",Carioca
Chet Baker,"I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light

I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light",I'm Beginning to See the Light

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely

Chet Baker,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low [Complete Take]
Chet Baker,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""

Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel [Master Take]
Chet Baker,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You) [Master Take]
Chet Baker,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

Chet Baker,"Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

'Twas like a breath of spring, heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again?
Keep repeating through again

Chet Baker,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely

Our bodies make it perfect
And your eyes can make me swim

I can barely hold my tongue
To say the least I'm into you

And your eyes
Are saying more than we can talk and warmer than our bedroom sport
And your thighs
Are kisses from the outside, girl that's all I need

I'll take you down the other road
To breathe in something more

I find it harder to ignore
The things I want you for

I know you don't want
I love you can sing

Do do do do do do do do do do do do

The rhythm was all
I needed to hear
A woman can treat my heart
Do do do do do do do do do do do do

When I press an ear up to your breast
I can hear the rhythm start
It's hard to tell our beats apart

So I hope you're listening right now
'Cause I can barely hold my tongue
The shit we do could warm the sun

And I
Twisted in a melting fall and sleeping with the scratching claws
And your words
Let me know you're feeling me and seeing all the things I see

Chet Faker,"(Sexual attraction is confusing, maddening, euphoric, even dangerous.
It drives people to extreme behavior, even unspeakable crimes.
The beating pulse, the sweating palms, the rise of chemicals in the brain are the symptoms of a much deeper, more mysterious affliction.
The mechanism that chooses and controls the objects of sexual desire can only be found in the heart of the unexplained.)

And there's too far
It won't change an empty stare

Hauntingly looks like hell

The cat's up and run away
Scratched at me first
Then the boy
Gonna panic for a little more
Watch the tail boy
Watch the tail

Like to be feeling the sand
Bring color
Back to both my arms the sun
Let it do damage like they said it
Would if given chance
Had to be shouting your voices
Scheming devils
Never make it through
Hey way to go lad
Hey way to go (Can't wait to go)

Closing out all my tabs
Tighten down the pitiful
Lend you a pen
Write it down
Or you know what you can do
With that
Watch that tail boy
Watch that tail

Could help us all end up in the
Clear
Then let the havoc choose
To shape us all, push us to invent

We could feed off the shame all day",Mexican Sun

And crying out you never seemed

It's all the same
Should I evolve
To tend to these sights
Said out loud then said again

Just a longer list of unsorted laws

So why then
Has all my life made no sound
And are your eyes
Closing even now
My life made no sound
I fear your eyes closing

This sacred chain
Brought down to trial
No better man could fail the way

The ravens tend
All along insisting

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there

There must be peace and understanding sometime
Strong winds of promise that will blow away
All the doubt and fear

Where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell me why, oh why, oh why wont that sun appear

Still I am sure that the answer gonna come somehow

For the room to fill with dust
And these four walls
Came down around us

Must have been something
Sent me out of my head
With these words so radical
And not what I meant
Now I wait for a break in the silence
'Cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again

I look back and I hated that I couldn't tell
I'm lying alone on the floor

How could I ever go back for more

Put everything back 
That you took out
Right when it started
Where we started

How could I get back what you cant give out again
How could I replace my mother how can I face my friends
How could I look in the mirror and shine the light again

Sono gemelle da quando
Siamo lontani anche se
Nello stesso universo

Qualcosa in fondo alla mente
Un sassolino che cade sul niente
E fa un gran rumore
Le nostre tracce lo sai
Si sono perse più volte
E ritrovarsi poi
È stato amarsi più forte
Ma adesso sento di più
Che la stagione migliore
È quella che non chiede niente
Una foglia all'autunno si arrende
 
Mi hanno detto che la vita
È ciò che accade mentre tu
Più del viaggio vuoi la meta
E non ti accorgi che hai di più
Quando arriva una salita
E per non cadere giù
Ancora di più
 
Un viaggio è come un film
Non si fa bene da soli
Anche l'amore è così
Un tatuaggio negli occhi
Ma va bene così
A volte perdi aderenza
Uno spavento non può farti male
È un'emozione da niente

È ciò che accade mentre tu
Più del viaggio vuoi la meta
E non ti accorgi che hai di più
Quando arriva una salita
E per non cadere giù
 Non si vince
Né si perde
Conta il meglio che puoi dare
Ancora di più
Ancora fino a non poterne di più

What's this I hear about these perfect 10s
My colleagues squawk about
Them Ritzy girl friends
A hundred pounds, a hundred pounds of trash
They talk to me, they ramble on in my ears
And their conversation's boring
I would bet anyone 50 dollars
'Cause I only wagon on the surest things
Anywhere, anywhere she would go
I would follow 500 miles away from home
Just for a fling, for a fling

I haven't known too many women
Throughout my less than lustrous career
But of all the relationships I've been in
To my 26 the others can't compare
She's my best bosom buddy, she's my partner
In the things I find important to share
She is fine, incredibly fine, it's no wonder
That she catches, that she catches all the stares

When you look at my face

Sometimes they come when I'm glad
And I'm glad when I think

Sewn into place

Gets hot
Under your feet, because the music
Is smoking'
I'm not choking, my words are
Well spoken
Yo, when I'm talkin' loud
And I'm sayin' much, about chic
And we're gonna touch
The heart of your soul
In a special way
Yo! remember the jams way back
In the day
Well they speak for themselves
And so does this funky beat
So get on the floor and move your feet
And don't stop until you get enough
That might be never

That pulls on heart strings

So here's the chance to relive the past
But in the present you'll hit that

And that makes the jam for real
'Cause it's something that you can feel

Something that you can feel

Something that you can feel

Move
I say that with conviction
The floor is so packed
You'll get high from the friction
Boom
We'll fill the room with the dance move
Every time I rhyme on a chic groove

Come on with the force of an
Army brigade
And we'll be rising on the charts
Like a high-top fade
So just
Grab your partner and dosie doe
'Cause with the neat, chic beat
You're good to go

A combination of style that's sleek
And unique
Put it together
There you have it, chic
Can you dance when your socks are
Knocked off
Rock so hard
We can knock your block off

Get on your Harley and ride

Kickin' the funk with soul

You wanna snap your fingers
And clap your hands
Your hair will stand on end
I mean every strand
We give no slack, 'cause the band
Is just too tight

All the partygoers in the mood

Never fear tomorrow
We're so strong together
We can last forever

Your love
Makes my world go 'round
Go 'round, go 'round
Go 'round, go 'round

There's no love like ours
You're my higher power
I can't get too much
And it's never enough

Your love
Makes my world go 'round
Go 'round, go 'round
Go 'round, go 'round

What your love does for me
The key that sets me free
To be what I can be
With full intensity
When your name, I speak
Sometimes my soul gets week
All my eyes can see
(is you)

In a world with me
In a world with me
In a world with me,(yeah)
In a world with me

There's one thing I know
I'll follow where you go
'Till the end of time
You'll always be mine

Your love
Makes my world go 'round
Go 'round, go 'round
Go 'round, go 'round",Your Love
Chic,"[Chorus]
He's a chip off the old block
Just like a robot, he'll do for you
What he's programmed to
He's a chip off the old block

He's so sharp, bright and smooth
It's a pleasure just to know him
He's a graduate from the old school
Of hard knocks, the sly fox

The carbon copy of his father
If you didn't like his pa, don't bother
Some of us think these qualities are grim
To be just like the one before him

[Chorus]

It's so hard to resist him
And the fact is that he knows it
He doesn't have to be persistent
In his whole make up he shows it

Don't trust your woman's intuition
I'm guilty by my own admission
Now that he's got me in his clutches
I'm walking around with my heart on clutches

[Chorus]

The program to make a man
A simple plan that surely can
Make humans act synthesized
I think he's homogenized

The program to make a man
A simple plan that surely can
Make humans act synthesized
I think he's homogenized

I was cruisin' with my favorite gang
The place was so borin', filled with out-of-towners tourin'
I knew that it wasn't my thing

I really wasn't carin' but I felt my eyes starin'

He had the kind of body that would shame Adonis
And a face that would make any man proud

He knew I'd never make him very proud
So I ran away from home to live all alone
And make myself a standout in the crowd

With a sixpack all alone
Feeds the cat he lives with
He picks up the telephone
Needs to talk with someone

One that's impossible to measure

This time the both of us can see
How we can love and still feel free

I found out what happiness can be

'cause baby
I'd given up
Ever finding
Someone
To share my life
Forever

This time we'll make it
Baby, we see
Nothing can take it from you and me
This time I feel it, like never before
Each day I love you more

This time our search for love has ended
All of our goals in life have blended
And baby tonight, I'll love your body, make you feel right
We'll see all our troubles can all be mended

No one else could touch me quite so deeply
No one's love could satisfy me so sweetly
Love me till the end of time

Why...even though you know I'm crazy
Do you still believe in me
Why...does a smile come so easy
Baby, since you set me free

Free from all the weary wasted hours
Free from all those meaningless encounters
Free to live our lives the way we want to
Free to realize just what we've been through
Love me till the end of time

Heaven's at my feet now that I've found you
Life seems so complete when I'm around you

Taken for granted it slips through your fingers 
And leaves you on needles and pins

Chicago,"A chauffeur dressed in gray, holds a sign, in leather gloves,
With instructions to meet the VIP upon arrival.
Father, mother, and sister trading smiles and playful shoves;
And their son is coming back home, coming to stay, ooh, woh, woh;

A lovely teenage queen stands there, waits for the boy she loves;
And she dreams of the summertime with him, upon arrival.
Now announcing the touchdown of the flight, it's right on time;
And a wave of excitement sweeps the room, ooh, woh, woh; ooh, woh, woh.

Each second of every minute seems eternal, time standing still;
Hearts beating quicker, minds racing fast.
Then suddenly shouts of laughter, tears of joy, flashes of light;
Handshake, introductions, lover's kiss.

Now, as the people go separate ways, I stand amazed;
Everyone has a story you could tell, upon arrival.
Still a girl in dark glasses waits until everyone's gone.
And she weeps, she's all alone, her love is lost, ooh, woh, woh, ooh, woh, woh.",Upon Arrival

And when you want to, they treat you like a Prima Donna

You're a movie queen, familiar face
Prettiest woman in the whole of the human race

You're gonna be famous, you want to go far
Name up in lights, everybody knows who you are
On with the show

How will it feel being number one
Hard to imagine but I can't blame you for tryin'
How will it feel havin' so much fun
Hard to imagine but it's so electrifying

Chicago,"Shadows were hiding what I couldn't see
Out in the dark - she was calling to me
Calling to me with a voice I'd never forget

She was a vision I couldn't believe
I held her close wo that she wouldn't leave
Suddenly hopeless - hopelessly falling in love

I remember the feeling
I remember the way
She came and wrapped her arms around me
Told me that she cared
Said she'd always be there

Taking me places that I've never been
She had the beauty that comes from within
Was I just dreaming was it too good to be true

I was a man all alone in the night
She came along and she showed me the light
I was confused then she told me the way
I was alone and I begged her to stay

She was alive I was caught by the fire
She brought emotions that filled my desire
I should have noticed that something was wrong
When I awoke she was gone

I remember the feeling
I remember the way
She came and wrapped her arms around me
Told me that she cared
Said she'd always be there

She brought emotions that filled my desire
I should have noticed that something was wrong
When I awoke, I could see that she was gone",Remember the Feeling

And though I lose a friend, in the end you will know oh

But tomorrow might rain so I'll follow the sun
All the time you couldn't tell me that one day I'd be glad
That something that I thought was love was misinterpreted

Chicago,"Right before my very eyes
I thought that you were only fakin' it
And like before my heart was takin' it

Baby, what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes

Yesterday it seemed to me
My life was nothin' more than wasted time
But here today you've softly changed my mind

Baby, what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes

Just to be alone
Was a little more than I could take
Then you came to stay

Hold me in the mornin'
Love me in the afternoon
Help me find my way, heh, yeah

Now and then just like before
I think about the love I've thrown away
But now it doesn't matter anyway

Baby, what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes
Baby, what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes

Baby, what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes
Baby, what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes

Baby, what a big surprise

Chicago,"As my life goes on I believe
Somehow something's changed
Something deep inside

So long

Chicago,"Did the best I could to make you mine
If you ever felt anything for me
Well, you never gave a sign

Thought time would make you change
Make you want me but baby I never had a chance
Now, I know that there's just some things
Just not meant to be

No use makin' you care about me
No way that I'm gonna win
Oh darlin', I might as well be chasin' the wind
Oh, I'm just chasin' the wind

Open up my heart, let you inside
If love was what you we're lookin' for
Well, I guess it wasn't mine

So I guess I better go, it's over and done
But you know I'm not really sad at all
'Cause you can't really say it's over
When it never had begun

No use makin' you care about me
No way that I'm gonna win
Oh darlin', I might as well be chasin' the wind
Oh, I'm just chasin' the wind

Can't reach the sea if you can't get past the sand
Can't touch the sky if you can't reach up your hand
Can't give if you give nothin' back

No use makin' you care about me
No way that I'm gonna win
Oh darlin', I might as well be chasin' the wind

(No use makin' you care about me)
Makin' you care about me

Chicago,"I understand there's no future for us here
Guess, I fooled myself into thinkin' there was
Now you've made it clear

It will never be right, guess we knew it all along
Now we've got to say goodbye
And I've got to be strong

So tell me one more time, how it's better for the both of us
Tell me one more time, how we'll hurt each other if we stay
Tell me one more time, my darlin' there's just one more thing
Before you walk away

Explain it to my heart, it's better that we're over now
Tell me one more time, this is the way it's suppose to be
Tell me that I'm better off without you, how it's better to forget about you
Darlin' I understand, now won't you please explain it to my heart?

Now if I try, I can see the reasons why
Why we can't stay together
And I might convince my mind

But it's breakin' my heart to know I've got to let you go
To find that I must leave behind
The only love I've known

Well, I can tell myself that I never really needed you
I can tell myself that it's better just to say goodbye
I can tell myself a thousand lies but tell me now
Tell me how I do

Explain it to my heart, it's better that we're over now
Tell me one more time, this is the way it's suppose to be
Tell me that I'm better off without you, how it's better to forget about you
Darlin', I understand, now won't you please explain it to my heart?

Say that I'll be better if we don't stay together
Say that I'll be better off free but don't say it to me

Explain it to my heart, tell me that I'm better off without you
How it's better to forget about you, darlin', I understand
Now, won't you please explain it to my heart?

It's better that we're over now, tell me one more time
This is the way it's suppose to be, tell me that I'm better off without you

Is bringing me down, bringing me down

Is something I just can't erase

We can't let it end this way 
So far away 
So close to something new 
But we're holdin' off tomorrow 
Maybe someday 
We'll find what we need to do, until then 
We'll be doing the best that we can 
Out of rhyme, out of time 
While we're hiding our feelings 
We're leaving love behind

You try to stand up and fight 
You've known pain for so long and you know what's gone wrong 
But you can't make it right 
Another broken heart is all you're feeling 
How can you go on 
But the memories of the times there was love in your eyes 
Keep leading me on 
(Chorus) 
If it were you 
Would you hold on and hope that it might 
Bring back the dreams we once knew 
Or just give up forever that part of your life 
Tell me what would you do 
If it were you 
You can never take back all you've given in love 
No matter how hard you try 
Once it's over and done you just have to let go 
Though a part of you died 
Another waste of time is all that's left now 
But life must go on 
All the nights that we spent, never thought they would end 
Why can't they go on 
(Chorus) 
If it were you 
Would you hold on and hope that it might 
Bring back the love we once knew 
Or just give up forever that part of your life 
Tell me what would you do 
If it were you 
If it were you 
Tell me what would you do 
If it were you 
Over and over I go back through time 
Didn't we promise our love till we die 
Asking you deep down inside 
Did we really try

All the nights that we spent, never thought they would end 
Why can't they go on

And somedays I feel so alone 
When nobody sees what's going on anymore 
If I could just know that someone's there 

One from the heart that's all it takes 
One to hold you, one who knows you 
One to one together 
One from the heart, one for each day 
One to lean on, one to keep on 

Keep on getting stronger the more I see your face 
It's never too late to get to where I want to go 
It's never too late to get to love someone 
All that I need is to be more than yesterday 

And all I can give along the way

You'll hear your heart pound so hard 
You'll miss her warm touch and the way things once were 
It's such a cold town when you miss her

When it's hard to mend what's broken 
And you still can't let her go 
Beyond the storm there's an answer 

Beyond the nights you spend alone 
Beyond the headlights and the highways you go 
You'll take a long ride without her 
Until the tears dry away 

In every way you try to reason 
When there's no reason left to hold 
Only time can heal the wounded of love 
Any day now time will tell 

Only love can turn it all around again 
There's no heart that time can't heal 
Whatever pieces you're missing 
Whatever you leave behind 

However you look at things they do change 
It's not the same conversation 
It's not the way that it was 
There'll be one less tear tomorrow 
There'll be one less night alone 

Only time can heal the wounded of love 
Any day now time will tell 
Only love can turn it all around again 
There's no heart that time can't heal 
Only time can heal the wounded of love 
There's no heart that time can't heal",Only Time Can Heal the Wounded

Maybe we just stayed too long 
I wish that I could lie 
And tell myself it's alright 
It was nothing at all

Somebody, somewhere 
Is falling in love tonight 
Is it nothing at all

Don't know where to turn

Should I let all the memories go 
Was it nothing at all

If I could just forget about us 
If I knew just where to start

What does it take 
To win you back 
To hold in these arms once more 
What can I say 
To make you understand 
You're still all I'm waiting for 
At times I feel it's best without you 
And times I still believe in you so much 
After what I've been through without you 
You'd think that I'd move on 
But you're still my destiny

They'll show you the way to what you have been seeking
To ignore them you're only cheating

Choose your road, just don't doubt it

You know i can't blame you for runnin' to him
Two people together but living alone
I was spreading my love too thin

But deep in the night it's an endless flight

Then I looked inside, past the fool,
And found some deeper words to say

We can make it better
We can make it right.

We hide behind the veil of our own success,
While we're following the rules.
Our eyes refuse to see past our little hands
To the never changing truth.
Freedom needs to speak a little louder,
Justice needs to try her other arm.
Some of us could push a little harder
To sound the alarm.
And I see children marching
And I hear the drums again

Until I had to turn away.
Then I looked inside, past the fool,
And found some deeper words to say.
If we hope and pray,
It will come, give it half a chance.

In our hearts and our mind,
You know there's nothing left to hide,
We're already there.

Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring,
Making spirits bright,

A sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago,
I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.

Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago,
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

To get together with you all

Twist and turn your head around
Till everything's unclear
Twist and turn your arm around
Until it is not there

And they'd love to burn you
Or at least to turn you around
Now you know what I mean

Can you look around you now
And tell us what's to be
Can you look inside yourself
And tell us what you see

As you feel the rumblings
As your head comes crumbling down
And you know what I mean

Someday you will see how long
We've waited for the time
To show you how we've died
To get together with you all

Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Chicane,"I, feel in my mind, 
I've got to let go, 
I've got to unwind. 
I, need a good time, 
I need to find love,
I've got to get high. 
You've got the passion, 
To feel inside, 
A little love, a little life,
Now you decide.
There ain't no reasons,
That we can't share,
A little love, a little life,
Can take us there.
You've got the instincts,
And now you know,
A little love, a little life,
Will let it show.
Just take a hold,
Of what you feel.
A little love, a little life,
Will make it real.
I, feel in my heart,
I want to let go,
And make a new start.

And your world has fallen down,

Butterfly that sings
Causes me to fall once more
Tomorrow you are only half a friend
Machines control your mind
And neon strips above my head

Come tomorrow, come tomorrow
There's never been an answer
There's always someone else to follow
And you are coming down, and you are coming down
Giving me the reasons for your lies

And when you turn me inside out
Don't know what you feel or dream about
And then you take me upside down
Remember my face, my name, my town

When I think of god he knows my mind
I'm wondering what's wrong
What will the devil find
Tomorrow you will find there's no way out
With nowhere left to turn
There's no place left to hide from him

In a city made of sand
We found our way out
But without a helping hand
We're free

Take me upside down
Take me, take me

And by my side you would always be
And then we'll be forever
And by my side you would always be

I'm hardly breathing, I'm slowly slipping under
But far away now, the stars too high to reach
But ever after the light is always colder
If you don't carry me then I might fall

And by my side you would always be
And then we'll be forever

There's nothing that you want to

There's nothing else to do
There's nothing left today
There's nothing here to hope for

There's nothing we can wait for anyway

Without moving me underneath

Better yet, let's forget 'bout this foolishness
And though I never asked for forgiveness
If you want to pray to him, here's some things I might say to him
Lord thank you for my wife, my father and mom
And God thank you for my daughter and son
You know the devil he's been doin us wrong
And I love both of my kids, but they momma can't raise 'em alone
And yo, I just want a better understandin
There's got to be another way to handle it
And well we got to be mature about it
We both made our mistakes, and can't no one get us out it
My little girl's a little lady
And though she often act crazy, she still my baby
And I anticipate the day that I can see
the smile on her face when she speak to Little J

They clonin little babies, these people goin crazy
And white America's on high alert
Black America's still starvin and livin in public housin
You still eatin off your food stamps
That's why one out of every three black boys end up in boot camp
And not to mention the ones we'll be missin
Let's face it, e'rybody can't make it
And e'rybody want to escape it (no way)
But if it's thug life we live, then thug life it is
But just remember, somethin gotta give
That's why, so many and die and, so little live
I can't explain it, but that's how it is
And God forbid, but it is what it is

For they young and dumb, and that's why I come to pray for 'em
Though some of us are better than most of us
You can't involve the kids with our differences
And since memories are all we have
Don't you agree that all little kids deserve to laugh?
I'm, teachin the facts about our black leaders
Cause they be strong people, just keep readin, it gets deeper
We're all God's people
So regardless of color and race, we all is covered in grace
And you gotta be stronger than most
Therefore, we only supposed to go when we chosen
Cause God for the thugs too
Just be sincere at heart and dawg, God'll still love you
So to all my fallen soldiers, the struggle's over
All in the name of Jehovah

[Chorus]

[Trick - speaking over kids]
Hold on, to your dreams, c'mon, why'know
Believe in love, and love be the light
I know, you know, that's right - he'll show you the way
I know, it'll shine on you, c'mon
And just pray with me, sing with me, c'mon
Sing with me, c'mon
Believe in love - he'll show you the way
I know you will - he'll show you the way, okay?
Just believe and pray

Chick Corea,"Sometime ago I had a dream
It was happy, it was lasting, it was free
And now in life, oh, can't you see
How we can make that dream into reality?

Oh, the music, it was playing
Oh, the firelight, it was dancing
All the children they were singing
All the people they were loving

Sometime ago I had a dream
It was happy, it was lasting, it was free
And now in life, oh, can't you see
How we can make that dream into reality?

Oh, the morning sun, it was soft and cool
Oh, the evening breeze, it was warm and gold
All together life had started to unfold
Sometime ago

",Sometime Ago-La Fiesta
Chick Corea,"Look around you my people
If you look then you will see
How to love, life is paradise all together
What game shall we play today?

Man just wants to be happy
Cast off things that shouldn't be
Set him free, life is paradise all together
What game shall we play today?

There's a way you can find it
It's within you, can't you see
Find the truth, it's not impossible all together
What game shall we play today?

Here we are all together
Free to have and do and be
What we see, for the first time all together
What game shall we play today?",What Game Shall We Play Today

She's so tender and warm
You'll recognize this is love
You'll find yourself on another plane

Chick Corea,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

Chick Corea,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me
Chick Corea,"Who said that money was everything
Well, that's a crock, you know what I'm sayin'
When the well runs dry 
Say goodbye to your fair-weather friends
If I need a hug 
And I feel like crawling under a rug
If I fell on my face
I know that you'd be there to help me up

'Cause it's you, only you that makes me strong
Ain't nobody gonna make me live my life alone

A friend won't leave me lying in the road
While the others they just pelt me with their sticks and stones
Won't steal my money
Won't rob my home or take my honey
A friend will always be there when I grow old

You know, lovers they come and go
Like ships to a dock, a bunch of heartbreakers they are
They blind you with their innocence 
Tie your heart in knots
If I need some hope
And I feel I'm at the end of my rope
You make that funny face
You're always there to cheer me up

'Cause it's you, only you to take me along
Ain't nobody I'd rather have to help me sing a song

A friend won't leave me lying in the road
While the others they just pelt me with their sticks and stones
Won't steal my money
Won't rob my home or take my honey

Chick Corea,"I can remember the rain in December
The leaves of brown on the ground
In Spain I did love and adore you
The nights filled with joy were our yesterdays
And tomorrow will bring you near me

I can recall my desire every reverie is on fire
Can I get a picture of all my yesterdays?
Yesterday I can say
I get a kick every time they play that Spain again

I can remember the rain in December

The bright lights and songs were our joy each day
And the nights were the heat of yearning

Can I get a picture of all my yesterdays?
Yesterday I can say
I get a kick every time I see you gaze at me

I see moments of history
Your eyes meet mine and they dance to the melody
And we live again as if dreaming
The sound of our hearts beat like castanets
And forever we'll know their meaning

But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered [Thursday, January 1: Show 1]"

Thick as a dream

Seems far away from here

Your deep wilson tattoo
Under the bullshit radar

But now it's too late.

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, 
Now it seems, 
This is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, 
Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why, 
And wonder why?

He said, â??My dear friends I have given my all.
I'm sorry, it's all over now.â??
When from the balcony way up high
There suddenly came a mournful cry

Oh, Mr. Paganini
Please play my rhapsody
And if you cannot play it won't you sing it?
And if you can't sing you simply have to
Scat

Listen Paganini,
We breathlessly await your masterful dtente
Go on and sling it
And if you can't sling it you simply have to
Scat

We heard your repertoire
And at the final bar
We greeted you with wild applause
But what a great ovation
Your interpretation of:
â??I never cared much for moonlight skies
I never blinked back at fireflies'

So, Paganini don't you be a meanie
What have you up your sleeve?
Come on and spring it
And if you can't spring it, you simply have to
Scat

Listen Paganini, please play my rhapsody
And if you cannot play it, wont you sing it?
If the boys is bopping
Aint no need in stopping

Chick Webb,"Evenings are crowded with memories
Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat

Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I heard one Bubble to another Bubble say
""I've been bit before, but never this way""
So later that night they all got dressed
The Bubble Bunch put on their Sunday best
And three of them decided to go
Where Super Rhymes rocked the disco
Well on my way to the jam to rock the beat
I seen these people comin down the street
Who were lookin like six at first to me
Turned out only to be three

Well they paid their money to come inside
And do stuff that they never tried
I had never seen a Bubble free
But these three Bubbles could move to me
Well half the night they danced away
A-bubble-bumpin anybody in the way
But the Bubble Bunch was hungry now
When the food started passin around
They didn't care what people think

And then they headed for the door
But before they left, they had to say
""Now you rock the Bubble Bunch way
You seen us dance, you heard the song
We're here to eat and run, so we have to warn
We're the (Bubble Bunch)""

Que luta por nosso Brasil

Man that's it about it, I don't wanna hear shit about it
Plus I think when this shit drops niggas gon' get about it

And I'm on in the tip of the stage slappin hands in the front row tight
Hittin blunt rolled tight, y'all swing 'em left to right
If ya feelin it
Don't even talk about this verse, just say I'm killin it
Whatchou think about that? It's just a thought, thought
I think flava to this whole shit is what we brought

See I've been thinkin all these bitch niggas need to quit it
And quick to speak on it niggas ain't never get it
Rhyme reported Chico the Chipper put it in order
What the fuck they run? Nuttin but they bath water
Last quarter, less than ten ticks
Standin at the line can't you feel this shit and bricks
Brickin like a busta
Cus you sour like lemon custard, don't trust ya
Nigga shoulda been rushed off the stage
Feelin nutty then bust a gauge
Cut like spades, blowin back out like hand grenades
Ya patna's over there bleeding
Now you in church, four days later obituary reading
Test me, lets see am I hard like I claim to be
Stomach scarred from the gang activity
Just a memory he did and I won't get caught
Let it be known fuck em that's my thought

The average man fragile, handle with care
On the contraire me, I'm a golden state bear
Dump a flare in the air
Two shot from the glocks
Style I got, karate chop through a concrete block
Chop the tree in the amount for the blunt
Doja, what niggas smoke out of where I come from
Hit hard blinds eye blitz, you Bret Favre
RIP Derrick Thomas promised to work hard
And hold it down like a big hog
Cool cats run with big dogs
Blacks fall victims to the White man's laws
Ain't nuttin new under the sun
But you never heard Defari's version of how the West was won
Two smoking mikes instead of guns
My tongue way a ton
They all want advice, you I got some
So many rap critics think they can spit it
Don't touch a mic if you ain't tight and that's on Likwit

I feel great hookin up the ill state in killa Cali
I'm about to make these muthafuckas feel a valley
Parallel Kurupt and Defari live
Without a deal, you should see the type of car I drive
With mista Chico the Chipper and Juice on the Glove beat
See this where the hip hoppers and the thugs meat
For you to drop a dope 16 joints
I'd have to lower my IQ a whole 15 points
I'm a Prozac gangsta, I sold crack thanks ta
My niggas I'm able to control whack prankstas
Exquisite, I freestyle I love it and I live it
Ask my niggas Tash and J-Ro, can I Xzibit?
I almost died on the bumpy plane ride
So now Cali Chronic well it got my brains fried
And if you muthafuckas want beef, well let my crew know

Eu teimo em colecionar

Lá vou eu de novo como um tolo
Procurar o desconsolo

De caminhar pelas trevas
De murmurar entre as pregas
De tirar leite das pedras

Mas, sob o sono dos séculos
Amanheceu o espetáculo
Como uma chuva de pétalas
Como se o céu vendo as penas
Morresse de pena
E chovesse o perdão

E a prudência dos sábios
Nem ousou conter nos lábios
O sorriso e a paixão

Pois transbordando de flores
A calma dos lagos zangou-se
A rosa-dos-ventos danou-se
O leito dos rios fartou-se
E inundou de água doce
A amargura do mar

Numa enchente amazônica
Numa explosão atlântica
E a multidão vendo em pânico
E a multidão vendo atônita
Ainda que tarde
O seu despertar",Rosa-Dos-Ventos
Chico Buarque,"Foi assim
Eu tinha alguém
Que comigo morava
Mas tinha um defeito que brigava
Embora com razão
Ou sem razão
Encontrei 
Um dia uma pessoa diferente
Que me tratava carinhosamente
Dizendo resolver minha questão
Mas não
Foi assim
Troquei essa pessoa que eu morava
Por essa criatura que eu julgava
Pudesse compreender todo o meu eu
Mas no fim
Fiquei na mesma coisa em que estava
Porque a criatura que eu sonhava
Não faz aquilo que me prometeu
Não sei se é meu destino
Não sei se é meu azar
Mas tenho que viver brigando
Todos no mundo
Encontram seu par
Por que só eu vivo 
Trocando?
Se deixo de alguém 
Por falta de carinho
Por brigar
E outras coisas mais
Quem aparece
No meu caminho
Tem os defeitos iguais

Se deixo de alguém

Por brigar e outras coisas mais
Quem aparece no meu caminho
Tem os defeitos iguais",Foi Assim
Chico Buarque,"Às vezes você me pergunta
Por que é que eu sou tão calado
Não falo de amor quase nada
Nem fico sorrindo ao seu lado
Você pensa em min toda hora
Me come, me cospe, me deixa
Talvez você não entenda
Mas hoje eu vou lhe mostrar

Que eu sou a a luz das estrelas
Eu sou a cor do luar
Eu sou as coisas da vida
Eu sou o medo de amar

Eu sou o medo do fraco
A força da imaginação
O blefe do jogador
Eu sou, eu fui, eu vou

Gitâ, Gita Gita Gita!

Eu sou o seu sacrifício
A placa de contra-mão
O sangue no olhar do vampiro
E as juras de maldição

Eu sou a vela que acende
Eu sou a luz que se apaga
Eu sou a beira do abismo
Eu sou o tudo e o nada

Por que você me pergunta?
Perguntas não vão lhe mostrar
Que eu sou feito da terra
Do fogo, da água e do ar

Você me tem todo o dia
Mas não sabe se é bom ou ruim
Mas saiba que eu estou em você
Mas você não está em mim

Das telhas eu sou o telhado
A pesca do pescador
A letra ""A"" tem meu nome
Dos sonhos eu sou o amor
Eu sou a dona de casa
Nos ""peg-pagues"" do mundo
Eu sou a mão do carrasco
Sou raso, largo, profundo

Eu sou a mosca da sopa
E o dente do tubarão
Eu sou os olhos do cego
E a cegueira da visão
É, mas eu sou o amargo da língua
A mãe, o pai e o avô
O filho que ainda não veio
O início, o fim e o meio",Gîtâ
Chico Buarque,"Quem é essa mulher
Que canta sempre esse estribilho
Só queria embalar meu filho
Que mora na escuridão do mar

Quem é essa mulher
Que canta sempre esse lamento
Só queria lembrar o tormento
Que fez o meu filho suspirar

Quem é essa mulher
Que canta sempre o mesmo arranjo
Só queria agasalhar meu anjo
E deixar seu corpo descansar

Quem é essa mulher
Que canta como dobra um sino
Queria cantar por meu menino
Que ele já não pode mais cantar",Angélica
Chico Buarque,"Era tanta saudade
É pra matar
Eu fiquei até doente
Eu fiquei até doente, menina
Se eu não mato a saudade
É, deixa estar
A saudade mata a gente
A saudade mata a gente

Quis saber o que é o desejo
De onde ele vem
Fui até o centro da terra
E é mais além
Procurei uma saída
O amor não tem
Estava ficando louco
Louco, louco de querer bem
Quis chegar até o limite
De uma paixão
Baldear o oceano
Com a minha mão
Encontrar o sal da vida
E a solidão
Esgotar o apetite
Todo o apetite do coração

Mas voltou a saudade
É, pra ficar
Ai, eu encarei de frente
Ai, eu encarei de frente, menina 
Se eu ficar na saudade
É, deixa estar
A saudade engole a gente
A saudade engole a gente, menina

Ai amor, miragem minha
Minha linha do horizonte
É monte atrás de monte, é monte
A fonte nunca mais que seca
Ai, saudade, inda sou moço
Aquele poço não tem fundo
É um mundo e dentro um mundo
E dentro um mundo e dentro um mundo
E dentro é o mundo que me leva
",Tanta Saudade
Chico Buarque,"Eu te vejo sair por aí
Te avisei que a cidade era um vão
-Dá tua mão
-Olha pra mim
-Não faz assim
-Não vai lá não

Os letreiros a te colorir
Embaraçam a minha visão
Eu te vi suspirar de aflição
E sair da sessão, frouxa de rir

Já te vejo brincando, gostando de ser
Tua sombra a se multiplicar
Nos teus olhos também posso ver
As vitrines te vendo passar

Na galeria
Cada clarão
É como um dia depois de outro dia
Abrindo um salão
Passas em exposição
Passas sem ver teu vigia
Catando a poesia
Que entornas no chão",As Vitrines
Chico Buarque,"Vou voltar
Haja o que houver, eu vou voltar
Já te deixei jurando nunca mais olhar pra trás
Palavra de mulher, eu vou voltar
Posso até
Sair de bar em bar, falar besteira
E me enganar
Com qualquer um deitar
A noite inteira
Eu vou te amar

Vou chegar
A qualquer hora ao meu lugar
E se uma outra pretendia um dia te roubar
Dispensa essa vadia
Eu vou voltar
Vou subir
A nossa escada, a escada, a escada, a escada
Meu amor, eu vou partir
De novo e sempre, feito viciada
Eu vou voltar

Pode ser
Que a nossa história
Seja mais uma quimera
E pode o nosso teto, a Lapa, o Rio desabar
Pode ser
Que passe o nosso tempo
Como qualquer primavera.
Espera
Me espera
Eu vou voltar",Palavra de Mulher
Chico Buarque,"Se a guerra for declarada
Em pleno domingo de carnaval
Verás que um filho não foge à luta

Se a terra anda ameaçada
De se acabar numa explosão de sal
Se aliste, meu camarada
A gente vai salvar o nosso carnaval

Vai ter batalha de bombardino
A colombina na Cruz Vermelha
Vai ter centelha na batucada
Rajada de tamborim
A melindrosa mandando bala
O mestre-sala curvando a Europa
A tropa do general da banda
Dançando o samba em Berlim

Chico Buarque,"Vai meu irmão
Pega esse avião
Você tem razão
De correr assim
Desse frio

Antes que um aventureiro
Lance mão

Pede perdão
Pela duração (Pela omissão)*
Dessa temporada (Um tanto forçada)*

Chico Buarque,"Tinha cá pra mim
Que agora sim
Eu vivia enfim o grande amor
Mentira
Me atirei assim
De trampolim
Fui até o fim um amador
Passava um verão
A água e pão
Dava o meu quinhão pro grande amor
Mentira
Eu botava a mão
No fogo então
Com meu coração de fiador

Hoje eu tenho apenas uma pedra no meu peito
Exijo respeito, não sou mais um sonhador
Chego a mudar de calçada
Quando aparece uma flor
E dou risada do grande amor
Mentira

Fui muito fiel
Comprei anel
Botei no papel o grande amor
Mentira
Reservei hotel
Sarapatel
E lua-de-mel em Salvador
Fui rezar na Sé
Pra São José
Que eu levava fé no grande amor
Mentira
Fiz promessa até
Pra Oxumaré
De subir a pé o Redentor

Chico Buarque,"Preciso não dormir
Até se consumar
O tempo
Da gente
Preciso conduzir
Um tempo de te amar
Te amando devagar
E urgentemente
Pretendo descobrir
No último momento
Um tempo que refaz o que desfez
Que recolhe todo o sentimento
E bota no corpo uma outra vez

Prometo te querer
Até o amor cair
Doente
Doente
Prefiro então partir
A tempo de poder
A gente se desvencilhar da gente
Depois de te perder
Te encontro, com certeza
Talvez num tempo da delicadeza
Onde não diremos nada
Nada aconteceu
Apenas seguirei, como encantado
Ao lado teu",Todo O Sentimento
Chico Buarque,"Vai passar
Nessa avenida um samba
popular
Cada paralelepípedo
Da velha cidade
Essa noite vai
Se arrepiar
Ao lembrar
Que aqui passaram
sambas imortais
Que aqui sangraram pelos
nossos pés
Que aqui sambaram
nossos ancestrais

Num tempo
Página infeliz da nossa
história

memória
Das nossas novas

A nossa pátria mãe tão
distraída
Sem perceber que era
subtraída
Em tenebrosas

Erravam cegos pelo
continente
Levavam pedras feito
penitentes
Erguendo estranhas

Tinham direito a uma
alegria fugaz
Uma ofegante epidemia
Que se chamava carnaval

Chico Buarque,"Eis o malandro na praça outra vez
Caminhando na ponta dos pés
Como quem pisa nos corações
Que rolaram dos cabarés

Entre deusas e bofetões
Entre dados e coronéis
Entre parangolés e patrões
O malandro anda assim de viés

Deixa balançar a maré
E a poeira assentar no chão
Deixa a praça virar um salão
Que o malandro é o barão da ralé",A Volta Do Malandro
Chico Buarque,"E se, de repente
A gente não sentisse
A dor que a gente finge

Então, eu te convidaria
Pra uma fantasia
Do meu violão

Canta, canta uma esperança
Canta, canta uma alegria
Canta mais
Revirando a noite
Revelando o dia
Noite e dia, noite e dia

Canta a canção do gozo
Canta a canção da graça

Que filha, visita a família em Sampa
Às pampa, às pampa

Talvez fique ruim pra pescar

Mas já tô quase bom
Em março vou pro Ceará

Explica que tá tudo okay

Peguei uma doença em Belém
Agora já tá tudo bem
Mas a ligação tá no fim

Pai, afasta de mim esse cálice

Mesmo calada a boca, resta o peito
Silêncio na cidade não se escuta
De que me vale ser filho da santa
Melhor seria ser filho da outra
Outra realidade menos morta
Tanta mentira, tanta força bruta

Como é difícil acordar calado
Se na calada da noite eu me dano
Quero lançar um grito desumano
Que é uma maneira de ser escutado
Esse silêncio todo me atordoa
Atordoado eu permaneço atento
Na arquibancada pra a qualquer momento
Ver emergir o monstro da lagoa

De muito gorda a porca já não anda
De muito usada a faca já não corta
Como é difícil, pai, abrir a porta
Essa palavra presa na garganta
Esse pileque homérico no mundo
De que adianta ter boa vontade
Mesmo calado o peito, resta a cuca
Dos bêbados do centro da cidade

Talvez o mundo não seja pequeno
Nem seja a vida um fato consumado
Quero inventar o meu próprio pecado
Quero morrer do meu próprio veneno
Quero perder de vez tua cabeça

Me diz pra onde é que inda posso ir
Se nós, nas travessuras das noites eternas
Já confundimos tanto as nossas pernas
Diz com que pernas eu devo seguir
Se entornaste a nossa sorte pelo chão
Se na bagunça do teu coração
Meu sangue errou de veia e se perdeu
Como, se na desordem do armário embutido
Meu paletó enlaça o teu vestido
E o meu sapato inda pisa no teu
Como, se nos amamos feito dois pagãos
Teus seios inda estão nas minhas mãos
Me explica com que cara eu vou sair
Não, acho que estás te fazendo de tonta

Irrequieta criatura
Tribo em frenética proliferação
Lúbrico, libidinoso transeunte
Boca de estômago
Atrás do seu quinhão

Vão aos magotes
A dar com um pau
Levando o terror
Do parking ao living
Do shopping center ao léu
Do cano de esgoto
Pro topo do arranha-céu

Rato de rua
Aborígene do lodo
Fuça gelada
Couraça de sabão
Quase risonho
Profanador de tumba
Sobrevivente
À chacina e à lei do cão

Saqueador da metrópole
Tenaz roedor
De toda esperança
Estuporador da ilusão
Ó meu semelhante
Filho de Deus, meu irmão

Rato que rói a roupa
Que rói a rapa do rei do morro
Que rói a roda do carro
Que rói o carro, que rói o ferro
Que rói o barro, rói o morro
Rato que rói o rato
Ra-rato, ra-rato
Roto que ri do roto
Que rói o farrapo
Do esfarra-rapado
Que mete a ripa, arranca rabo
Rato ruim
Rato que rói a rosa
Rói o riso da moça
E ruma rua arriba
Em sua rota de rato

Tenaz roedor
De toda esperança
Estuporador da ilusão

Não vou a Ipanema 
Não gosto de chuva 
Nem gosto de sol

Desliguei, foi engano 
O seu nome eu não sei 
Esqueci no piano
As bobagens de amor 
Que eu iria dizer 
Não, Ligia, Ligia 

Eu nunca quis tê-la ao meu lado 
Num fim de semana 
Um chope gelado 
Em Copacabana
Andar pela praia até o Leblon 
E quando eu me apaixonei 
Não passou de ilusão 
O seu nome rasguei 
Fiz um samba-canção
Das mentiras de amor 
Que aprendi com você

Nos seus braços serenos 
Eu vou me render

Tem dias que a gente se sente
Como quem partiu ou morreu
A gente estancou de repente
Ou foi o mundo então que cresceu
A gente quer ter voz ativa
No nosso destino mandar
Mas eis que chega a roda viva
E carrega o destino pra lá
Roda mundo, roda-gigante
Roda moinho, roda pião
O tempo rodou num instante
Nas voltas do meu coração
A gente vai contra a corrente
Até não poder resistir
Na volta do barco é que sente
O quanto deixou de cumprir
Faz tempo que a gente cultiva
A mais linda roseira que há
Mas eis que chega a roda viva
E carrega a roseira pra lá
Roda mundo (etc.)
A roda da saia, a mulata
Não quer mais rodar, não senhor
Não posso fazer serenata
A roda de samba acabou
A gente toma a iniciativa
Viola na rua, a cantar
Mas eis que chega a roda viva
E carrega a viola pra lá
Roda mundo (etc.)
O samba, a viola, a roseira
Um dia a fogueira queimou
Foi tudo ilusão passageira
Que a brisa primeira levou
No peito a saudade cativa
Faz força pro tempo parar
Mas eis que chega a roda viva
E carrega a saudade pra lá
Roda mundo (etc.)

Chico Buarque,"Carolina
Nos seus olhos fundos
Guarda tanta dor
A dor de todo esse mundo
Eu já lhe expliquei que não vai dar
Seu pranto não vai nada mudar
Eu já convidei para dançar
É hora, já sei, de aproveitar
Lá fora, amor
Uma rosa nasceu
Todo mundo sambou
Uma estrela caiu
Eu bem que mostrei sorrindo
Pela janela, ói que lindo
Mas Carolina não viu

Carolina
Nos seus olhos tristes
Guarda tanto amor
O amor que já não existe
Eu bem que avisei, vai acabar
De tudo lhe dei para aceitar
Mil versos cantei pra lhe agradar
Agora não sei como explicar
Lá fora, amor
Uma rosa morreu
Uma festa acabou
Nosso barco partiu
Eu bem que mostrei a ela
O tempo passou na janela
Só Carolina não viu",Carolina
Chico Buarque,"Esto no puede ser no mas que una cancion
Quisiera fuera una declaracion de amor
Romantica sin reparar en formas tales
Que ponga freno a lo que siento ahora a raudales
Te amo
Te amo
Eternamente te amo
Si me faltaras no voy a morirme
Si he de morir quiero que sea contigo
Mi soledad se siente acompañada
Por eso a veces se que necesito
Tu mano
Tu mano
Eternamente tu mano
Cuando te vi sabia que era cierto
Este temor de hallarme descubierto
Tu me desnudas con siete razones
Me abres el pecho siempre que me colmas
De amores
De amores
Eternamente de amores
Si alguna vez me siento derrotado
Renuncio a ver el sol cada mañana
Rezando el credo que me has enseñado
Miro tu cara why digo en la ventana

Chico Buarque,"É o pau, é a pedra, é o fim do caminho
É um resto de toco, é um pouco sozinho
É um caco de vidro, é a vida, é o sol
É a noite, é a morte, é um laço, é o anzol
É peroba no campo, é o nó da madeira
Caingá candeia, é o matita-pereira

É madeira de vento, tombo da ribanceira
É o mistério profundo, é o queira ou não queira
É o vento vetando, é o fim da ladeira
É a viga, é o vão, festa da ciumeira
É a chuva chovendo, é conversa ribeira
Das águas de março, é o fim da canseira
É o pé, é o chão, é a marcha estradeira
Passarinho na mão, pedra de a tiradeira

É uma ave no céu, é uma ave no chão
É um regato, é uma fonte, é um pedaço de pão
É o fundo do poço, é o fim do caminho
No rosto um desgosto, é um pouco sozinho

É um estepe, é um prego, é uma conta, é um conto
É um pingo pingando, é uma conta, é um ponto
É um peixe, é um gesto, é uma prata brilhando
É a luz da manha, é o tijolo chegando
É a lenha, é o dia, é o fim da picada
É a garrafa de cana, o estilhaço na estrada
É o projeto da casa, é o corpo na cama
É o carro enguiçado, é a lama, é a lama

É um passo, é uma ponte, é um sapo, é uma rã
É um resto de mato na luz da manhã
São as águas de março fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida no teu coração

É uma cobra, é um pau, é João, é José
É um espinho na mão, é um corte no pé
São as águas de março fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida no teu coração
É pau, é pedra, é o fim do caminho
É um resto de toco, é um pouco sozinho
É um passo, é uma ponte, é um sapo, é uma rã
É um belo horizonte, é uma febre terça
São as águas de março fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida no teu coração",Águas de Março

Chico Buarque,"Não me leve a mal
Me leve à toa pela última vez
A um quiosque, ao planetário
Ao cais do porto, ao paço

O meu coração, meu coração
Meu coração parece que perde um pedaço, mas não
Me leve a sério
Passou este verão
Outros passarão
Eu passo

Não se atire do terraço, não arranque minha cabeça
Da sua cortiça
Não beba muita cachaça, não se esqueça depressa de mim, sim?
Pense que eu cheguei de leve
Machuquei você de leve
E me retirei com pés de lã
Sei que o seu caminho amanhã
Será um caminho bom
Mas não me leve

Não me leve a mal
Me leve apenas para andar por aí
Na lagoa, no cemitério
Na areia, no mormaço

O meu coração, meu coração
Meu coração parece que perde um pedaço, mas não
Me leve a sério
Passou este verão
Outros passarão
Eu passo

Não se atire do terraço, não arranque minha cabeça
Da sua cortiça
Não beba muita cachaça, não se esqueça depressa de mim, sim?
Pense que eu cheguei de leve
Machuquei você de leve
E me retirei com pés de lã

Chico Buarque,"Renata Maria
Ela, era ela era ela no centro da tela daquela manhã
 tudo o que não era ela se desvaneceu 
Cristo, montanhas, florestas, acácias, ipês  
Pranchas coladas na crista das ondas, 
 as ondas suspensas no are
 pássaros cristalizados no branco do céu
 e eu, atolado na areia, perdia meus pés
  Músicas imaginei , mas o assombro gelou 
Na minha boca-as palavras que-eu ia falar
 nem uma brisa soprou
 enquanto Renata Maria saía do mar

  Dia após dia na praia com olhos vazados de já não a ver 
Quieto como um pescador a juntar seus anzóis
 ou como algum salva-vidas no banco dos réus
  Noite na praia deserta deserta deserta, daquela mulher
 praia repleta de rastros em mil direções
 penso que todos os passos perdidos são meus
  Eu já sabia, meu Deus , tão fulgurante visão 
 não se produz duas vezes num mesmo lugar 
Mas que danado fui eu
 enquanto Renata Maria saía do mar
Saía do mar

Chico Buarque,"Lúcio Arranjei novo amor no Leblon
Que corpo bonito, que pele morena
Que amor de pequena, amar é tão bom!
O Dick! Ela tem um nariz levantado,
Os olhos verdinhos bastante puxados
Cabelo castanho e uma pinta do lado

É a minha Tereza da praia
Se é tua é minha também
O verão passou todo comigo
O inverno pergunta com quem

Então vamos a Tereza na praia deixar
Aos beijos do sol e abraços do mar

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Chico Hamilton,"Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last
Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me

Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Was you",Long Ago (And Far Away)
Chico Hamilton,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves
Chico Hamilton,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around",The Second Time Around
Chico Hamilton,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile
Chico Hamilton,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know",More Than You Know
Chico Hamilton,"I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light

I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light",I'm Beginning to See the Light
Chico Hamilton,"People,
People who need people,
Are the luckiest people in the world
We're children, needing other children
And yet letting a grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children
Lovers are very special people
They're the luckiest people in the world
With one person one very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst

But first be a person who needs people

I see you riding 'round, baby, riding in a brand new car
I see you riding 'round, baby, riding in a brand new car
I know you couldn't buy it sitting on your caviar
Now your bracelets, your furs and that Paris label
They're laying right there, laying on the table

Go get me some money baby, and lay it on the table

Chico Hamilton,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way
Chico Hamilton,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When
Chico Lobo,"Beira de mato é bom
Mas é mió de bom
Quando a viola chora
Uma moda gostosa sem sair do tom
O pensamento voa, faz que vai embora
Cruza as fronteiras do tempo
Levanta poeira, mas volta num pé de vento

Beira de mato é bom
Mas é mió de bom
É quando a lua cheia
Do céu incendeia nossos corações
Que se percebe a lira, que ao caboclo inspira
Numa vidinha bem simples
Ter sempre esperança de colher o pão

Um fandango, um guaiano
Recorta a viola que eu quero cantar
Bate um catira caboclo
Mostrando a beleza desse lugar

Beira de mato é bom
Mas é mió de bom
Rio que banha a gente
Água de nascente, fulô de alecrim
Um jeito caipira de levar a vida
Sem se assustar com onça, com
Seca, geada e nem pererê
Beira de mato é bom
Mas é mió de bom
A moça apaixonada
Que é tão desejada
Pelo seu peão

A tropa e a boiada
Seguindo as estradas
Desse Brasil que
Acredita na força que
Tem esse sertão

Um fandango, um guaiano
Recorta",Beira de Mato

Chico Lobo,"Hora a água apaga o fogo
Hora o fogo seca a alma
Essa vida é um jogo
Cada qual com sua mágoa
Duas margens prendem um rio
O curral cerca a boiada
Vem o vento e traz o frio
Feito ave em revoada

Hora a chuva faz enchente
Hora a seca mata o pasto
Vem o tempo e leva a gente
A vereda é um mundo vasto
No roçado do meu peito
Semeei uma paixão
Pra colher amor de longe
Que domasse a solidão

O destino é um vento bravo
Que destrói nossa ilusão
Faz com a morte um conchavo
Muda a sorte num clarão
Na poeira do caminho
Nenhum rastro sobrevive
Palmeira não tem espinho
E um amor eu nunca tive",Palmeira Seca
Chico Lobo,"Êh chão brasileiro tanto tempo faz
Que eu sai pro mundo levando boiada
E não paro mais

Êh chão brasileiro tanto tempo faz
Que eu sai pro mundo levando boiada
E não paro mais

Tropa boiadeira sem eira nem beira
Estrada de chão
Num lombo de um cavalo um laço amarrado
Ee um bom gibão
Um céu de estrelas me guia na noite que já se vai
E eu vou cortando estradas levando boiada para Goiás

Êh chão brasileiro tanto tempo faz
Que eu sai pro mundo levando boiada
E não paro mais

Êh chão brasileiro tanto tempo faz
Que eu sai pro mundo levando boiada
E não paro mais

Sob um sol forte que esquenta as veias do coração
Destino estradeiro traçado nas linhas das minhas mãos
Em cada parada um sonho possível de realizar
Encontrar a morena que esteja a espera da tropa chegar

Êh chão brasileiro tanto tempo faz
Que eu sai pro mundo levando boiada
E não paro mais

Êh chão brasileiro tanto tempo faz
Que eu sai pro mundo levando boiada
E não paro mais

Na lida estradeira sou violeiro nos entardecer
Quando a tropa descansa ao redor do fogo

Vai buscar a morena que outro dia deixei pra trás",Tropa
Chico Mendoza,"I had some problems and no one could seem to solve them.
But you found the answer.
You told me to take this chance and learn the ways of love,
My baby, and all that it has to offer.
In time you will see that love won't let you down.

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby.
There is so much love inside me,
And all that I have I'll give my all to you;
All, all my love, baby and:

All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.
All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.

I want to squeeze you, please you

I'm about to lose control and I think I like it!
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I want you

We shouldn't even think about tomorrow
Sweet memories will last a long, long time
We'll have a good time, baby, don't you worry
And if we're still playin' around, boy, that's just fine

Chico O'Farrill,"Say, have you seen a Carioca
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Now you'll dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh

I've been hoping that you woulld

She told me that she'd seen me
Every morning and had fallen
In love with me.

Much too scared to give me the eye

Chicory Tip,"Just about a year ago, I set out on the road,
Seekin my fame and fortune, lookin for a pot of gold.
Things got bad, and things got worse, I guess you will know the tune.
Oh ! lord, stuck in lodi again.

Rode in on the greyhound, Ill be walkin out if I go.
I was just passin through, must be seven months or more.
Ran out of time and money, looks like they took my friends.
Oh ! lord, Im stuck in lodi again.

The man from the magazine said I was on my way.
Somewhere I lost connections, ran out of songs to play.
I came into town, a one night stand, looks like my plans fell through
Oh ! lord, stuck in lodi again.

Mmmm...
If I only had a dollar, for evry song Ive sung.
And evry time Ive had to play while people sat there drunk.
You know, Id catch the next train back to where I live.
Oh ! lord, Im stuck in lodi again.

Chicory Tip,"Marianne, oh, Marianne, oh, won't you marry me?
We can have a bamboo hut and brandy in the tea
Leave your fat old mamma home, she never will say yes
If mama don't know now, she can guess  
My, my, yes
 
All day, all night, Marianne
Down by the sea side siftin' sand
Even little children love Marianne
Down by the seaside siftin' sand
 
When she walks along the shore, people pause to greet
White birds fly around her; little fish come to her feet
In her heart is love but I'm the only mortal man 
Who's allowed to kiss my Marianne 
Don't rush me
 
All day, all night, Marianne
Down by the sea side siftin' sand
Even little children love Marianne

Chicory Tip,"Every human being has a weakness of kind or he ain't no human at all
Every man or woman has some habit you just cannot stall
Lots of people gamble, and a lot of people swear, and a lot of others live for TV
When it comes to habits I'm the man who will always succeed.

Cigarettes, women, and wine, are the only three vices of mine
And each one is a must that I just can't give up, oh
Cigarettes, women, and wine
Cigarettes, women, and wine are the only three habits of mine.
With a girl and some wine, and a smoke I feel fine, oh
Cigarettes, women, and wine

Father said be careful, and my mother said beware there's lots of freaky stuff you don't need.
Stay away from habits that could bring you down on your knees

Put me on an island in the middle of an ocean
With only three wishes to choose
I can count them in a second cause there's only three things I can use

Cigarettes, women, and wine, are the only three vices of mine
And each one is a must that I just can't give up, oh
Cigarettes, women, and wine (that's right I said)
Cigarettes, women, and wine are the only three habits of mine.
With a girl and some wine, and a smoke I feel fine, oh

Te dibujó la luna en un trozo de papel

Que te dio una cita en este hotel

Que te burlas de mi  que me engañas

Chicos de Barrio,"Duerme soñando
Con tus ojos tan llenos despiertos
Con tu corazon lleno y radiante
Alucinante, lleno de amor

La vida la vida, la vida,que es la vida 
En tratar de entenderla, se nos va la propia vida
Tan simple y tan fuerte, tan llana mente suerte
Lo que acontece, preparación de la muerte

Pero es absurdo ocuparte de este estudio
Cada año,segundo a segundo
No es tan profundo, dormir soñando 

Es la respuesta, tal vez es erronea
Tal vez es correcta, sueña a la par del presente y no del futuro
Porque de esto no estas tan seguro

Acá, tus enojos, existes y eres libre, afuera tus despojos
Llena tus maletas de responsabilidad
Deja para mañana tu personalidad
Mas si tu te sientes una contradicción
Que al dormir te despiertas, y al despertar te duermes
Tal vez si lo dices no eres tan inteligente

La gente solo observa la ropa y los hechos
Mas no existe entre ellos una real conexión
Pues siempre cree tener la razón
La razón justa y procesadora
De lo correcto que se hace cada hora

Pero en este sueño tu estas sumergido
Mas nunca te sientas nunca afligido
Porque en este sueño tu estas protegido
Y aunque te sientas un poco distante 
Tu alma lo dice cada instante

En tratar de entenderla, se nos va la propia vida

Sobraba mi pasión tan desbocada
¡Calendo en lo espesos del amor!

Perdóname por a verte lastimado sin querer
Solo quise quedarte mimarte adorarte
Perdóname por el abuso a tu persona por favor
Quiera dios que los años te quien
¡Las heridas que te causo mi amor!
