Thanks To Gravity,"To a one-time wizard
I just hope this dream will end
Reflections on the sidewalk are still breathing
Please let me see
I'm climbing on a ten-foot globe
Wizard, oh Wizard
I just got fired from the last job in town
I want you to turn the world into a giant cigarette
So I can burn it
Burn it like the flag

We're catching stars
On paper plates
In the morning

Brothers, oh brothers in the clouds
When will your hands be clean?
I want you to build a sand dune for me
Catch it like the wind in a butterfly's net
I refuse!
I refuse to let you straighten me out
My backbone of defence
My backbone of life
My backbone of wonder
My backbone of thought
My meter is running
Catch me if you can

Catch me
Catch me",Catching Stars on Paper Plates
Thao & Mirah,"And you said you knew
How you were gonna take it
That you'd take it all
That you knew my heart was not that small
And how could we ever manage
Carts and horses could never carry

All I want to give
Not give enough 
I want to give
Not give you love

I chose the strangest little cup
To drink you from and stir you up
And you were beautiful it's true
And all I ever wanted was 
To be good to you

And when you see me cry
You ask me, but I think that
You already know why
I'm staring up at the sky

And you said you understood
But promises are not that good
In this improper marriage
Love and justice found miscarriage
At the only embassy
With an office for the daily reach out ?

And when you see me cry
You ask me, but I think that 
You already know why
I'm staring up at the sky

And when you see me cry
You ask me, but I think that 
You already know why
I'm staring up at the sky",Little Cup
Thao Nguyen,"I could tell in the way
He did not kiss back
What's the use in painting faces
You're never gonna find a shade to match

Well yours is a common name
And I hear it all the time
Could belong to anyone
It could never be mine

I am tired
I am through
When I love I will love so hard
Harder than I could love with you

There's nothing in your eyes
But slightly amused
An offer of me you politely refused
Is it that my heart beat too loud
Is it that I did not bid it come down
Your round about etiquette
You hold the door but you won't let me in

I am tired
I am through
When I love I will love so hard
Harder than I could love with you
Harder than I could love with you

I won't make you flex emotion
I won't make you come a little closer
Do what you want
Don't do it for me
What's the use in chivalry

I am tired
I am through
When I love I will love so hard
Harder than I could love with you
Harder than I could love with you

Thao Nguyen,"He shone a light and called it a star
Named it after me
Well I didn't stare too hard
Just wanted to see
Your words so sweet
They parch my throat
But so worthy
Because you told me so

Scattered across airports
Leaving thoughts of you
Planting mountains in my wake
And still you cut right through

And you fall upon me
Just like a city sky
All hot on my neck
Easy on my eyes

And I did too but I came back

I am not a fast talker
Fast enough to talk you in

And we turn century
And we wait, we wait
We turn century,

To those hands
On the small
And the big
The in between

Do you call me

That Handsome Devil,"Lord, let’s send down some angels
And they better have guns
Cause everybody’s crazy down here
On everybody’s drugs

Casinos, floor glows, stock shows
Where white trash goes to die
Hos push carts
Crackhead squirrels, and birds too drunk to fly

She said “Oh baby do the end of the world”
C’mon baby it’s the end of the world

She said “Oh baby it’s the end of the world”
C’mon baby it’s the end of the world
She says “Smile! It’s the end of the world!”

And they send down some astronauts
To study our bones
Through the miles of garbage
Beneath all the junk that we own
Carbon dating beer cans, condoms, and twinky wrappers
We was something beautiful baby
What the hell happened

Keep dancing, it’s the end of the world
She said “Oh baby do the end of the world”
C’mon baby it’s the end of the world
She says “Smile! Do the end of the world!”

If you were worried that they’d skin you too
For new tennis shoes
Or a couch that fits the motif of the living room
And doesn’t clash with your business suit

I wanna be in a museum,
Stuffed and in a realistic position like I’m huntin
Callin someone or buyin somethin
Way too busy to look up and see what was comin

Tearing off the duck tape
Wearing just a pair of socks

In hysterics when the sheriff stopped
Crying, with her hair in knots
Smelling like Smirnoff

Even Guy Debord needed spectacles, you see
I'm the Greek economy of cashing intellectual cheques
And now I'm trying to progress, but instead of selling sex

On bikes from schools and cars
With autumn leaves fallen sparse across mid-afternoon
She blazed about how
‘Cultural language is an operation system
A simple interface rendered feeble and listless
When tested with a divinity or a true understanding
Of the human condition
I never did understand – the duality of art and reality
Living life and treating it as such but with a certain disconnect
To touch that cajoles at the artist with comfort and abandon
And between the spires and rolling roofs of the white city
That orange, English light cast only one, singular shadow
For you are not beside but within me

The 1975,"I wish you'd walk in again
Imagine if you just did
I'd fill you in on the things you missed
Oh sleepless nights, a grown up man dressed in white
Who I thought might just save your life
But he couldn't, so you died

I don't like it, now you're dead
It's not the same when I scratch my own head
I haven't got the nails for it
And I know that God doesn't exist
And all of the palaver surrounding it
But I like to think you hear me sometimes

So I reached for a borrowed fleece
From my dad or from Denise
Always trying to keep warm, when you're the sun

I sat with you beside your bed and cried
For things that I wish I'd said
You still had your nose red
And if I live past seventy-two, I hope I'm half as cool as you

I got my pen and thought that I'd write
A melody and line for you tonight
I think that's how I make things feel alright

Made in my room, this simple tune
Will always keep me close to you
The crowds will sing their voices ring
And it's like you never left

But I'm bereft you see
I think you can tell
I haven't been doing too well",Nana

She is a pain in the nose
And I'm a pain in women's clothes

She had to leave because she couldn't hack it

You call yourself a friend?
I got two left feet and I'm starting to cheat
On my girlfriend again
I caught a pinky in her nose
As the crowd cheered for an overdose
And I don't suppose you know where this train goes
There was a party that she had to miss
Because her friend kept cutting her wrists
Hyperpoliticized sexual trysts
Oh, I think my boyfriend's a nihilist
I said, hey kids we're all just the same
What a shame

Ya know, how I'd love to go to Paris again (again, again, again and again)

And counting my eye rolls
And like pistols falls in the snow
Uh oh

Man you putting me up on a shelf
Well I believed you're clean
But only I've seen your fist for myself

And then she pointed at a bag of her dreams
In a well posh magazine
I said I'm done, babe I'm out of the scene,
But I was picking up from Bethnal Green
She said I've been romanticizing heroin

She lights like a child nevertheless

My hair is brown, she's scared to touch

Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind

Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town

Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye

Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine

I left her and threw away the key to paradise

I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
'n' Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billy Joe
The 5th Dimension,"First day in August
Last rain was in May
When the rainmaker came to Kansas
In the middle of a dusty day
Said the rainmaker said to the people
""Tell me what you are prepared to pay""
Said the rainmaker said to the people
""Now, I'm a-conjure up a rain today""

By a mystical name
And the rainmaker called on the thunder
And suddenly it began to rain
And the rainmaker passed his hat to the people
But the people all turned away
And the rainmaker's eyes and the Kansas skies
Well, they both became a darker gray

And they knew the rain had come to stay

Come again another day

Come again another day

With a good night's kiss, my love
I feel that I'd miss
That longing, deep inside my heart
But I have to go
Before the morning grows too old, now
The second star from the right
Is the one I use as my guiding light

Tonight, I cast my spell
And I wish upon a star
Star of fate keeps me moving along
Follow that dream of my heart

As I seal your lips
With a goodbye kiss, my love
It's been hit and miss
Hurting deep inside my heart
But I have to go

Habla pochito EspaÃ±ol
But makin' you dance is what I'm here for

Don't have to make love to make you conceive
Watch the movements of the body and you say 'I believe'

Commit a crime yo, but never leavin' a clue

Young men, all wise, all seein'
Talk to the people but never deceivin'
Only one land that we call mother
Don't know what it is, look at the cover

Your girl is feelin' horny? Well, we can soothe her
Make her jump for joy, so start to rejoice
We are the three, we keep the panties moist

(Y'all ready for this?)

Let the beat commence, see, we feel that it's time
For you to pump it out loud as we knock out the rhymes
So everybody get hype it's, the way it should be
Sincerely yours, compliments of the 7A3

Just pause - cause the world is yours
And all the kinky cuties want to kick them drawers
Your city kills but I'm tellin the truth
Everybody gets crazy when we start to get loose

Is it the tone of the voice or the dimples in the cheek?
The movement of the bodies or the way that we speak?
Is it the way that we look or the way that we kiss?
Nah, we got a fresh rhythm, why'all, and it goes like this

(Get funky with it)
(Don't say it's easy)

Get off the wall if you're sittin in the club
Have another drink if you're sittin in the pub
If you're a hermit sittin home all alone
Call up the party line but get on the phone

See, we don't believe in being boring and bland
You want to have stupid fun? Then we're your helping hand
Life is a party, so don't make it mundane
Get crazy retarted and stupid the same

Honest and open and most forthright
If you don't understand, then you're not that bright

I'm known as world's finest, my name is Sean E.B.)

Well, I'm Bret E.B. but you can call me unique

The 7A3,"Hit 'em again
(Here's a little story that must be told)

Police maybe, punks never
Our rhymes are slammin and we won't ever
Become intimidated by the gossip stated
Instead we'll strive and let it motivate us

'Cause we are brothers, don't try to diss
The 3 will get evil and then commit
Assault with deadly lyrics and make you admit
7A3 - we ain't havin' it

When you recover you'll try to contend
But the 3 will be waitin' and we'll hit you again

Intellectual seekers, seekin' intellect
So if you're stalkin' you better come correct
And guaranteed that when I give you a taste
It's like I buck you in your head and your grill out your face

So when they come to your funeral the casket's closed
The secrets that you keep are never exposed
'Cause you thought you was a champ but you're just another vic
Said we were stupid but you're not that slick

Heard we're in the house, got your posse and hurried
Looked into my eyes - and then you scurried
Out the door because you have no heart
I see you seen the future and it tears you apart

Once you was a enemy but now you're a friend
Because you don't want the 3 to hit em again

Once upon a time when I first started rhymin'
I used to wonder when I would start climbin'
The charts, lookin' away from the common problem
I lacked patience, and virtues, I had none

So I had to learn as time went on
About the trips I might be sent on
And by trips I don't mean a vacation
The first law of nature is self-preservation

So my motto is to hit em again
You want to know why? Well, my friend
In the end the truth is you may not win
And if you don't win you can hit em again

Because of what I am and how I stand
You tend to fear my kind of man
Collectin' knowledge from the mother Earth
And seekin' out the prophecies since the date of birth

Brothers and sisters, believe in your dreams
Because without em you're a falcon with just one wing
Always lookin' over mountains to see the sky
When you could look down as in the clouds you fly

Look at the child and all I feel is sorrow
It's hard today, and then tomorrow...
See, life is a game and anybody can win
And if at first you don't succeed, well then you hit em again",Hit 'em Again
The 7A3,"World, wake up, can't you see what's goin' on
We all live in sin and say the other man is wrong
But yo, in the '80s, this world is out of hold
'Cause man hates himself, but he loves the battlezone

Ignorance is on the loose
The color of my skin could put my neck in a noose
Yo, my brain is haunted from the hate and violence
And everywhere I rock I see they take a code of silence

Said in the Bible that my Savior died
Yet other than me, they say the Lord has lied
People walkin' like zombies, they never know
What they're doin', what they're seein', 

what they're hearin', where they're goin'
It seems to me that the nature of man
Is to abolish all the knowledge that he can understand
Livin' with Lucifer, yo, you better cease
'Cause it's all about peace

Wise but still wonderin', all of the blunderin'
My soul is drenched in blood and the sky is thunderin'
Subject to all discrepancies
Is a man who chooses his enemies

[unknown] all the blessings or the color of his shirt
My enemy is chosen when a animal is hurt
The honor of the tiger can destroy the man
But he fights to the death till he cannot stand

Satan has prophets such as Hitler
We use human flesh to paint a picture
So many died, so many cried
By a German maniac, is to live out a lie

[unknown] warrior magic of a ?magician?
Producin' death, the nuclear technician
Man disrespects his woman and whose mind is fair
Are the only ones who speak and show that they care

Others turn their heads and they say it's a shame
But they live in a ???? so tell me who's to blame
You're livin' with Lucifer, yo, you better cease
It's all about peace

In 1984 the devil opened the door
For the next 7 years the Earth he shall explore
King Jr., a noble man who believed in peace
Must have thought he was wrong, so his life had to cease

Hate is a necessity and love is a choice
Men are persecuted if they choose to voice
Their opinion, see, the world's so opinionated
This is fact, not fiction that I just stated

Don't know it all, but understand a lot
Boy is playin' in the sand and in his head he's shot
By another brother who had brought the tool
He was robbin' a sister for her dookie gold

Children subjected to satanic rituals
Run demonic ways which they make habitual
Spend a million dollars on a Super Bowl
Meanwhile a child is starvin' only three years old

Classy anglosaxons, filthy white trash
Dancin jiggaboos, high yellow ass
Seems that the world is so stereotypical
We turn on our own, that's somewhat hypocritical

You're livin' with Lucifer, boy, you better cease
It's all about peace

And all we are sayin', my brothers
Is give peace a chance",Lucifer
The 7A3,"Saw the homeboys from the days of delirium
'89 Benzes, guess who's steerin' em?

Doin 120 in the car lane
Girl in every lap, cause that's the name of the game
Destination - come on, you know where we're goin
Don't get the wrong idea, nobody's gigolo'in

We arrived, but what we did I cannot tell
Couldn't play it on the air, cause it's kinky as hell
When the boys come together, we do the wild thing
Birds and bees, birds sing as the bees sting

Screams of passion, voice is goin' hoarse
Right in that butt with crazy force
In the morning take a shower, kiss the girl on the cheek
Slam the door shut as I enter the streets
That's how I'm livin'

Yo, that's how I'm livin'

Always on the move since the age of the child
To keep my blood pumpin' I live the wildstyle
Live, love and laugh from dawn to dust
Every day is a new day, to conquer is a must

Ask me any questions and I take the fifth
Not sayin' where we been, or who we're hangin' with
My posse's lurkin' in the heat of the night
Look into the eyes and you never see fright

Treated like superstars, lifestyle bizarre
Ridin' limos, and never drive a car
Ate seafood, hate burgers and fries
Then we trick a little, but I never tell lies

Wake up a 12 and hit the studio
Later on tonight we'll be filmin' the video
Pick up a check at the end of the day
And then I scoop up a lady, cause a man gotta play
That's how I'm livin'

Tell these motherfuckers how we're livin'

For all the niggas chill in the east, you know what I'm sayin'?
Brooklyn in effect

Caviar dreams, champagne wishes
Makin love to high class bitches

Take you how you want it, cause we are what we are
Makin' millions, but on the faces no scars
You're rollin' with a posse, they seem to make you bolder
Talkin' mess lookin' over your shoulder

Don't worry 'bout a thing, you won't get snuffed
We pull a one-on-one and you get bumrushed
See, I live on the street, never carry a nine
Hit your heart and leave you staggerin like moonshine

Get ill as shit, shootin' celo
Got so much money, think I'm sellin' by the kilo
I ain't with it, everybody sells drugs
Left it in the past, we're educated thugs

Young (young) with an innocent look
Look at the cover, but never judge a book

Think I'd be safer all alone

I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me

I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again

I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball...

Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
Aha-ahaaa
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world

A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind
Ain't it sad
And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldn't fancy me
That's too bad
So I must leave, I'll have to go
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same...

I try to reach for you.  but you have closed my mind
Whatever happened to our love?  I wish I understood
It used to be so nice.  It used to be so good
 
So when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me S.O.S.?
The love you gave me. nothing else can save me, S.O.S.
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on?

You made me feel alive but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out. I wish I understood

Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud

Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing

Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music

She says I began to sing long before I could talk
But I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty

The ABBA Revival Band,"I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through,
Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.

And I understand you've come to shake my hand.

Trying to say
What I've always wanted to know
You want me to know that you're mine, mine

It's been a long time
A lonely time
It's been a hard time
An empty time

Dancing to music
And singing each line
As I shine, shine, shine, shine

Slowing down to see the time that passed you by
Your life story to tell with only one second to live

When days turn into years and a loss of life
Death rattles a mile away from your restless symphony

The shadows that crept lonely all around

Where we burn fast in the build of our lives

When tales must be told, changed and retold

Tear me away from this and if

I would be the happiest man
So drown them all, open the 
Floodgates and drown them all 
They are the cancer and we are the cure
Lets skip to the last page and 
See how it ends, wake up, promise me 
You will wake up, you saved my life 

And that's all I need, just don't leave me now
Don't quit on me now you are all I have
The world will never stop unless
We make it stop, the sky will never fall 
Unless we let it fall, so this is the end
And the world is ours",Pity

Sift ya lye

Extremely hard to be the king of a city it's dis
A nigga that could twist like this
A nigga that could rip any shit that he get
Never balk and come with a metaphor like this
Flow like dis, never broke but flow for the dough like this
Never been a nigga that you know like dis
Cold like dis, but ah, it's just me and D-Mo like dis
Respect is a must, got every nigga in every hood checking for us
Never catch us catching the bus
Niggas got whips, niggas got loot,
niggas got troops, got guns, got clips (what)
Next big thing, iced watch to go with the necklace ring
Iced out to go with the rest it seems
More or less the more of the best you seen
Big buzz, only rolling with big thugs
We get in clubs you know you getting ya shit bust
Not too many ducks is going against us
If ya don't know now, you'll know when ya lift up
Rhyme till I can't rhyme no more, ball till I can't ball no more
Till I'm 5'9"" no more, till the ice can't shine no more
Which ever comes first, let's go nigga

[Chorus: x2 (Twista)]
Who the fuck want what?!
Who the fuck want what, want what?!

(You gotta send the deck up when we holla)

[Royce Da 5'9""]
One of a hundred niggas'll hate my shit
Eighty-nine'll bite, the other ten'll think of coming alike
Cuz my shit when it come to the mic, 99 outta 100'll like
Never disrespect a nigga gripping the tec, it's my shit
Put the flow in affect with my clique
Go to the death, flow the best, my spit, I'm sick, it's my shit
Try to get slick and niggas is getting hit
You don't want that do you? It comes back to you
And I ain't even trying to rap to you, so suck my dick, it's my shit
Too many willing to pin ya in rap
put a ending to that, do the math with me
Straight to the lab, we're sending you back
Keep going, you know that no one can last wit me
Stay armed with the biggest of arms, got bitch-niggas hitting alarms
Every rhyme is strictly writing to harm
This my shit, keep every word of every verse in position to launch
Never gon' fail, never got plans of catching a L
I'ma forever prevail, whatever you yell
It's my world, everything else, c'mon nigga

I could cause a scene to make you throw up
Put a bullet in yo' gut, bat em down and leave the sto' cut
Cause homie you ain't got no choice ta,
That why you running to a real rider like Twista, or Roysta
Let the thirty caliber anoint ya
Whodie won't even know he hit till he feel his shirt suckin the moisture
Voice ya opinion if ya want to
Kick-ass winner, kick up dust in the middle of the arena
Subpoena motherfuckers like the courts do
We'll blast shortly ya nuts bust and it won't be a misdemeanor
We them niggas that'll come approach ya
Shocking ya body our Bacardi keeps all ya nerves from bleeding
Until we heard no breathing, two undercovers,
we coming we get the dirty even, they know it's serving season
Shit is good as gone, cause I gotta bring the goodies home
The petty packing penny brushing with the pretty pearl handle
Pistol, Pelle Pelle pants and the hoodie on
And you coming with the Midwest shit?
Remember how we took you, you tripping off how we did that shit
Somebody tell me where the weed at
Some niggas knew I was about to snap so he hid that shit
I was gon' get buck, come hard, get crunk
Go into a thing and let the rhyme ride,
and hit them niggas from the blindside
And take the whole opposition down with my dog 5'9
Ceremony for the killers, busting 'em off,
and coming off so you can bust yo' nut
Though I'm bout to bust yo' guts
But if yo' operation is hating, who the fuck want what?

We duck behind the corner store
Smoke your smokes while I keep
A watchful eye
Right here, right now
I hope before the night is through
One fumbled touch will finally hit the spot
You've got everything going for you
So I'll go for you with everything I got
Right here, the best days of our lives

Is there anything I missed?
Is there anything I missed?

But why would we change a thing?

Cascading across the bed, and you are mine
When your parents start to wake for work
Between the sheets, I'll keep a watchful eye

I let it ring for a long, long spell
I looked through the window, I peeked through the blind,
And asked him to tell me what was on his mind.
He said, ""Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.""

I was cleaned and skinned and so hard-pressed
I called the woman that I love the best
I finally reached my baby 'bout a half past three
She said, ""I'd like to know what you want with me.""
I said, ""Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.""

She screamed and said, ""What's wrong with you?
From this day on, our romance is through.""
I said, ""Tell me, baby, face to face
A-how could another man take my place?""
She said, ""Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.""

Well, I learned my lesson and now I know
The sun may shine and the wind may blow
Women may come, and the women may go,
But before I say I love 'em so,
I want-- money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.
(If you want to get along) Well, make some money
(If you want to get along) Well, I ain't jivin' you, honey

The Ackermans,"Some people remember the first time
Some can't forget the last
Some just select what they want to from the past
It's a song that you danced to in high school
It's a moon you tried to bring down
On a four-in-the-morning drive through the streets of town

Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand

It's a photograph taken in Paris, at the end of the honeymoon
In 1948, late in the month of June
Your parents smile for the camera in sienna shades of light
Now you're older than they were then that summer night

Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand

It's a need you never get used to, so fierce and so confused
It's a loss you never get over the first time you lose

And tonight I am thinking of someone, seventeen years ago
We rode in his daddy's car down the river road

Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper

The Acorn,"Lullaby (Mountain) by The Acorn
I, I will wash over you
I know your heart is true
Little Mountain of mine
?Cause the sun set down on me
You turn your head and slowly start to breathe
Like the common bonds on carbon, buried deep
I?m the shadow of the long forgotten dream
But I, I will wash over you
I know your heart is true
Little mountain of mine
But every word I wrote left incomplete
And the promises I never got to keep
Though you toes grow colder as you sleep
The blood runs through your heart with every beat
?Cause I, I will wash over you
I know your heart is true
Little Mountain of mine
I, I will wash over you
I know your heart is true

There's a life you live in spite of me
And for all the fruit that bore your seed
There's a wet worm waiting by your feet
By your feet by your feet
There's another apple you don't eat
And oh I curse the weight of me
The heavy purse drug at your heels
And the dead straight line that pulled you in
Got tangled in our spiral spin
In our spin in our spin
The tangle that I left you in
And all the love I thought we had
A tire tread that slips when wet

Where the rhythm creeps
You may see a girl
Bopping to the beat
Swings her hips
And swings her hair
Sparkle in her eye
Somewhere in the darkness
She gets high
She's a rocker
And she likes to rock-n-roll
Tenderly she holds you
In her soft embrace
All she wants
All she says
Is dig that dig that bass
If you go down to that basement
Where the lights are low
You know she'll be there
Stealing the show
Like a fire burning
She's hot she's hot

When the right road has been found

Around back, underground, where the trees shield
In the corner of the yard, another death room
Where the dead are buried in an unmarked tomb

Stiff blue painted cat wired to the roof
Cyanide in the darkness and dangling goat hooves
Floor covered in dirt, dead grass, and decay

Crawling up the walls
Like a cat in heat

And the air is thin
And it blows through your skin
And you feel like something
Is about to begin
But you don't know what
And you don't know when
So you tear at your hair
And you scratch at your skin

You wanna run away, run away
Just get on the fucking train and leave today
And it doesn't matter where you spend the night
You just might end up somewhere in a fight, in a fight
Or caught in your room on a concrete shelf
Fighting all alone, with yourself, with yourself
And you just wanna feel like a coin that's been tossed
In a wishing well, a wishing well
A wishing well, a wishing well
Well, you're tossed in the air
And you fell and you fell
Through the dark blue waters
Where you cast your spell
Like you were just a wish that could turn out well

So you stand on the corner
Where the angels sit
And you think to yourself,
""This is it, this is it,
This is all that I have
All I can stand
Is this air in my lungs
And this coin in my hand
That you tossed in the air
And I fell, and I fell

To yourself, when you think

You thought suicide was an alibi
But you were always a mess
You were always aloof

But it's the awful truth
It was truth from the first
To the last words that she read

And she emerged from the dark
Like a ghost in my head
She said, ""I haven't forgot

And I cry in my sleep
And I tear up your letters
And I burn them in heaps
And I gather the ashes

When the world waits for us a thousand years in the crush
Of our eyes fearless in awe
Quietly we'd fade in to sleep
With nothing on our minds

Then we love to be loved
In the rush we become
Some things we thought we'd never be
We were surprised by our how hard
Left weary and scared
By the nights, spent feeling incomplete
And all those evenings swearing at the sky
Wishing for one more time
All the promises we broke when we tried
Just wasting all our time

We get old all at once
And it comes like a punch
In the gut, in the back, in the face
When it seems someones lied
And our parents have died
Then we hold to each other in their place
And I feel the water rising around us
Maybe that's okay
Yeah I feel the world changing, all at once
I guess it will be okay

When we all had one hope
There was someone looking down
To return our bodies to each other
And the ground",All At Once
The Airborne Toxic Event,"All of these grateful looks
All these grateful eyes
All the furious stares these fretful sighs

Promising everything
To everyone
We'll be back soon
You're my favorite one

And I'll keep it quiet
I'll hold you dear
The whispering fills the ear
Tell me you'll stay
We would have such fun
And the lie, you don't need anyone

And the screams, the wails, and the call
The headiness of the fall
Ten-thousand miles from where we began
Falling asleep with a picture in hand
It was all for a woman

You say that you're grateful for the time alone
Two years away and I don't miss home
And someone asks you if, you ever think of her
So you smile politely and you demur

But then all at once your head starts to swim
And you can feel her breath on your skin
If I let you stay, the same spot today
She's above you, below you in ways

And you're shivering cold
Like you're just ten years old
And she's lying asleep in your bed
And you're standing beside her
The light from inside her
Filling up the darkness in your head
It was all, for a woman

You've drowned in our teasing
You've forgotten the reason
The muse inspires the art
You'd give anything for
For her to say them once more
The words you believed at the start

Ten-thousand miles from where it began
Falling asleep with her picture in hand
And it was all, it was all
For the look in her eyes
Of the promise and the lie of a woman",All For a Woman
The Airborne Toxic Event,"The other day when we were walking by the graveyard near the house
You asked me if I thought we would ever die
And if life and love both fade so predictably
We've made ourselves a kind of predictable lie

And so I pictured us like corpses
Lying side by side in pieces
In some dark and lonely plot under a bough
We looked so silly there all decomposed
Half turned to dust in tattered clothes
Though we probably look just as silly now

Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye to all this dog-eared innocence
I can't pretend that I can tell you what is going to happen next or how to be
But you have no idea about me
Do you?

And it left me to wonder if people ever know each other
Or just stumble around like strangers in the dark
'Cause sometimes you seem so strange to me, I must seem strange to you
We're like two actors playing our parts

Did you memorize your lines? 'cause I did
Here's the part where I get so mad I tell you I can't forget the past
You get so quiet now and you seem somehow like a lost and lonely child
And you just hope that the moment won't last

Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye to all this dogged innocence
I can't pretend that I can tell you what is going to happen next or how to be
But you have no idea about me
You have no idea about me
Do you?

So there's always a way around
There's something tying our feet to the ground
A moment passed we hear how it sounds
Then it seems a little less profound
Like we're all going the same way down
Yeah we're all going the same way down
I'm just trying to write it all down

'Cause I write songs and you write letters
We are tied like two in tethers
And we talk and read, and laugh and sleep
At night in bed together
And you wake in tears sometimes
I can see your thoughts flash across your eyes
They say darling will you be kind, will you be a good man and stay behind
If I get old?

And then the letters all pass through my head
With the words that I was told
About the fading flesh of life and love
The failures of the bold
I can list each crippling fear like I'm reading from a will

And I'll defy everyone and love you still
I will carry you with me up every hill
And if you die before I die I'll carve your name out of the sky
I'll fall asleep with your memory and dream of where you lie
Maybe better to move on and to let life just carry on and I may be wrong

Still I'll try
'Cause it's better to love, whether you win or lose or die
It's better to love, whether you win or lose or die
It's better to love, and I will love you 'til I die",The Graveyard Near the House
The Airborne Toxic Event,"On the night that we met
You said that you wanted
Something more from me
And it was all that I could do

I remember your face, like a child
The way that you blushed and
The way that you smiled

Now it's all that I can do
And I wake up feeling new
There's so much more than I ever knew

So I think of all those years spent alone
It's like you're searching for something
To make you feel whole
Like you're half of something else
Like you're half of something else
Just a fraction of yourself

You take it so hard, we did what we could
There were no easy answers
To be understood
It was all that we could do
We're the only ones who knew
Now all I think about is you

The way that you screamed
The way that you cried
The way that you wiped your eyes
And fall against my side
The way that you told
Told me I was wrong
And the way that you'd sing
When you'd hear a song
And the way that you'd answered
When you knew I was gone
Now I know that I'm blind
And that you're all I see
And I know it's not clever
I just want you with me

He was just six months out of Dhino
Trying his hardest to stay clean

Like doves sleeping with broken wings
In a bed fit for a king
It didn't mean a thing

It was shot gun forest wedding
But they forgot to bring the guns
They were too busy counting promises
To the children not yet born
No one could afford the ride
They just hitched up the 101

And they'd sing and they'd sing and they'd sing
Like doves dancing with broken wings
With a view fit for a king
It didn't mean a thing

It was a loneliness
They would confess
Like the world had gone bad I guess
So they hold hands and look into the eyes of God
They'd say tell me why'd ya hide from us
Why'd ya fill the world with wickedness
Why'd ya spare us from your grace but not the rot

Now my dad says fuck the details
Just keep your head down hard
Ya got to find yourself alone before you'll find the eyes of God
You maybe broke and scared and mad as hell
At the flesh of your own heartstrings
But you were born to be a peasant not a king

Standing by the church I had a bottle and a pen in my hand
I said ""father, I'm sorry, I just don't know what to do with this anger""

Oh but punks like us we were always receiving instruction

A boy the side of the road he had a gun in his hand

Oh man he was excitable, we were just trying to make him a man

It seems like days that I've been waiting
For this dream to pass
It goes so fast
It seems nothing lasts
I think I've lost something

Stuck here with these people
While you wake I crush our bodies in one space
I feel your heart blood from my tongue
I wonder where you've gone

And the ever turning, spinning wheel of people, places lies I feel
The restless beat of the sleepless night to come
I just want to be numb
Just want to be numb

Hopeless these three years like smoking years
I go from place to place
Just endlessly and half asleep
Like I'm falling alone at some endless breach

I don't know what I've done
I just go over it again and again and again
I can't sleep at night
I cant breathe
But If I drink tonight I'll get you off my mind

And the ever present pit I feel
I'm turning on some spinning wheel
Of faces and the scenes I see
And none of it seems real to me

And the miles feel like inches when I think of you
It's been twenty five days that I've been gone
And twenty five weeks since I've seen my home
I spend twenty five months chasing this song
And all of this time I've been alone

You walked right through the doorway
You tell me you're here to stay
And the worst is gone and back I'd holler, 
Had you been here this way
And you knew it all along
I wasn't happy all along
And nobody at home had wanted me to just come home

Then you walked right through the doorway
You tell me you're here to stay
The worst is gone and back I'd holler, 
Had you been here this way
And I only just learned how to stand like a man
I got twenty five years of running instead
How could I see that girl at my feet
Then you came to me and I was caught in the storm
That I wasn't alone",The Storm

I felt her spirit stay in the room.
And I wished that our lives were just endless
'Cause it's all too short, and I'm leaving soon.

I want to keep them with me.
We will never part.

We are, we are,
We are timeless, timeless.
Everything we have, we have,
Everything oh my god.
You are, you are,
The only thing that makes me feel like,
I can live forever, forever.
With you, my love.

I see her, they run through the tall grass
Such thoughtless minds, I wish I was thoughtless too
What is this hole in my heart, that I cannot abide
I just want you to stay with me tonight.

We are, we are
We are timeless, timeless
Everything we have, we have,
Everything oh my god.
You are, you are,
The only thing that makes me feel like,
I can live forever, forever
With you

Just help me through this moment
After everything I told you
How the weight of their loss is like the weight of the sun.
I see their faces near me,
I hear their voices callin,
It's like their lives were over before they begun.

Oh ooh oh

We are, we are
We are timeless, timeless

The Airborne Toxic Event,"Someday they’re going to write about us,
Living here in the shadow of this gathering dust,
As the waves build up and drown the light,
While we’re hanging from buildings on a Saturday night.

And the words she said
I could barely hear over the blare of the speakers and the smell of beer,
As she got up to speak, she lifted her dress.
I remember her face but I forget the rest.

Here in California, I was
Just a name and a number, a face on a tumblr.
Here in California, we’re all stuck in the same scene,
All nightmares and daydreams
In California.

She said, “I got money, but I got no friends,”
As we drove through the valley in her daddy’s Benz.
She said, “These pills wear off, but the pain don’t end.
I never thought it would matter so much to pretend.”

And the thing about her that haunts me still
As her hands fell down to the steering wheel,
And a shock of light fell across her face,
She said there’s only two ways out of this place.

Here in California, I was
Just a name and a number, a face on a tumblr.
Here in California, we’re all stuck in the same scene,
All nightmares and daydreams
In California.

And oh, I hope it’s clear
There’s no room for us anymore in the atmosphere,
But darling I always liked the desperation in your eyes,
The way you’d dance in the glow of the Hollywood Freeway lights.

Someday they’re gonna forget about us
And we’ll wonder if we were ever good enough.
It hit me last night, in this song I heard,
I remember the feeling but forget all the words.

Here in California, I was
Just a name and a number, a face on a tumblr.

I'm soaked to the skin with the pain of my unease
From such a strained existence

The tension in this world keeps me from sleep
I'm hungry and cold
There's a weight hanging over my shoulders
A rain black cloud of doubt

Have I got enough love
Have I got enough hope?
Enough strength to face the world each day?
I know there's an answer somewhere in this night
I see her each time I look in your eyes

I'm walking in a wild place
I am banging on the gates
On the other side of the tracks babe
Hoping that someone's gonna hear me pray

Oh there's a dawn chorus breaking out all over the town

Will you say you want me,
Wwill I say I want you?
Will you say you love me
When I'm stripped and forced to stand up naked
And will I still love you

The goal that I want can't exist without fire
And you fire the thoughts that realise all my dreams
These are a grown man's tears

I lost all faith, I lost all hope
I started drinking, life became a joke
Something would keep me going.
I didn't know what it was
But I saw it each time I looked in your eyes

I'm walking in a wild place
I am banging on the gates
On the other side of the tracks babe
Hoping that someone's gonna hear me pray

Oh there's a dawn chorus breaking out all over the town

Oh my god
Why do I feel the doubt

You give me something I can't live without
Yet from somewhere there comes an emptiness
A feeling that I can't suppress

Is this the start of the beginning or the point of no return?

There's an answer there
When I look in your eyes

I'm walking in a wild place
I am banging on the gates
On the other side of the tracks babe
Where all my doubts are now laid away away away away
I'm walking in a wild place

I've opened doors and let the tourists in

I've stood on guard as my Queens were born

I've cut the grass on many English lawns

Of strawberries and ice cream
Of cricket and cold beer

These days
London Tower's burning. Parliament's ablaze
Buckingham Palace has gone
Somewhere in the distance my darling she's a crying
I should be by her side

This is the day the ravens left the tower
This is the day the ravens fly away

Fly away, fly away.
Fly away, fly away.
Fly away

I've stood on the Changing of the Guards
To the Bloody Tower watching the Crown Jewels
A penny for the guy sir?
Will you vote left or right?

London Bridge is falling.
St. Pauls Cathedral bums
The tower blocks are gone
Somewhere in the distance my darlings she's a crying
I should be by her side.

This is the day the ravens left the tower

This is the day the ravens fly away

Fly away, fly away (fly away)
Fly away, fly away (fly away)

A man breaks down to that unemployment sound
He takes a last walk down that old coast road
In the dying death throes of all that he knows

Was like a lame pit pony at the end of its days

(Fire, Fire, Fire)

In a Deeside town eight thousand went down
In a February day in the driving rain
No winners just losers and cuts and bruises
As the picket lines fell, the industry died
There's still one question after all this time
Is a working man bom to live and then die?

Fire Fire Fire.

To build the ships to set the sails
To cross the sea of fools
To be dealt the cards
To play our hand
To win or else to lose
In this cruel world that kicks a man when he's down

(Hey now)

And Lady Luck smiles on the few in this world
And I hope and I pray that she smiles on you
I ain't gonna preach, no I ain't gonna teach
I 'm just gonna sing about the things that I need

A little bit of love, a little bit of hope
A little bit of strength, some fuel for the fire

But who to believe is hard to define
When some say the future is unwritten
Some say the simple things in life are the best
When all is dark and dusty down the tracks
And all paths from exile have roadblocks on all points
Saying ""No, No way out of here, go back from where you came from""
And some say when you're down you fight the hardest
Some tighten the belt others let go
Someone once said, if you don't ask you don't receive
Someone showed me that written down in the back of a book

And as I reach out and see my life unfold
I tell you this because I truly believe in it
Ask and you'll receive my friend
Seek and you shall find

Is written down on everything I see

To drag us down but I cry with anfer I have done
No crime. For up no the terrace I can hear the
Crowd roar and down in the subway I can hear

Them whisper and through all the ragin glory of
The years we never once thought of the fears fir

Disillusion the Sixty Eight guns will never die

The Alarm,"Well I find myself in reverie
'Bout what we might have had
And what might have been
We had something going once

That was such a long, long time ago
It was way back in '76
Our friendship formed of pure innocence
We first met in Mathew Street

Where we heard something that would set us free
A sign stands over a door, it says
""Four lads who shook the world""
In the depths of those heady nights

We would dream of those bright lights
Oh my friend, Oh my friend, Oh my friend

And my friend John, he went away
He made some mistakes
Spent time in Walton jail
And now when I see him we still talk

But there's no light shining in his eyes
And Susie, she was seventeen
And more beauty in this world
I swear you'll never see

I was gonna be king
And she was gonna be queen
But now all she does is hide behind the tears
If there was more sense in this world

And work wasn't so hard to find
You would not be going your way
I would not be going mine
Oh my friend, Oh my friend, Oh my friend

Somewhere tonight out on the street
Somewhere beneath this city's heat
In the eyes of strangers who pass me by
Life is cruel and so unkind
Oh, Oh the SPIRIT OF '76

And Pete has seen his dreams come true
But that don't make him no hero
He's just one of the lucky few
If a man can't change the world these days

I still believe a man can change his own destiny
But the price is high that has got to be paid
For everyone who survives there are many who fail
I've seen my friends caught out in that crossfire

All their dreams and hopes smashed on the funeral pyre
I will never give in until the day I die
Get myself some independence
Carve out a future with my two bare hands
Oh my friend, Oh my friend, Oh my friend

Somewhere tonight out on the street
Somewhere beneath this city's heat
In the eyes of strangers who pass me by
Life is cruel and so unkind
Oh, Oh the SPIRIT OF '76

Mersey lights shine in the distance
Same as they did for us then
Mersey lights shine bright in the distance
Where are you now my friend?

You see some nights when I can't sleep
I still think of you

And all the promises,all our dreams we shared
I know those lights still call to you
I can hear them now
I can hear them now

(Let em shine)

On the hardship that had struck I saw the seven phials open
The plague claimed man and son
Four men at a grave in silence With hats bowed down in grace
A simple wooden cross,
It had no epitaph engraved (it had no)
It had no epitaph engraved.

That'll be the day rock'n'roll died
Far away on a dark and stormy night
Brought into the new decade
The sixties and her pearly gates
A hard rain fell and the times forever changed
In the back of a car with the wind in our hair
Speeding down the road going anywhere
Was it true we were really going nowhere?

Sixty eight rang like a ricochet
The world arose to a nightmare day
Some people found their voice and a world to change
One small step for man was one giant leap for mankind
How I wish that we could walk that way tonight
On a Woodstock field in the heat of the night
Rock'n'roll music defined the times
The sound of generations collide

And the seventies king of rock'n'roll
In Gracelands lost his throne
There won't be any comebacks tomorrow
No Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones
Why they were taken away? God only knows
We formed a band we were haunted by their ghosts
I remember it now like it was yesterday
Playing those guitars at a frantic pace
Somewhere we got lost along the way

A radio played an epitaph
Imagine, the dream is over
Oh I've been silent way too long
You never thought I knew what was going on
You probably think that you are in this song
The tragedies behind the dreams
Belie the truth and the honesty
I have seen the dirt and the glory

One will kill out of greed or anger
One will give his life for another one

There are blooms in the walls of stone
And we will see ourselves
In the eyes of everyone we have ever known

And the heart, the heart will ever be a witness

The Album Leaf,"you were sewn to the ground, so you cut the wires of lead.
you swim against the tide, yet you drowned in the sky. 
you whispered to make a sound, and you crawled to reach the ground. 
you held your head up high, yet you duck beneath the clouds. 
you are on your way. 

this one was locked, closed down and refrained. 
you tore through the glass, no one could understand.
as you pushed them all away, you made them all return. 
this on was overcome, yet you lost in the end. 
you are on your way.

The Alchemist,"Intro: Lloyd Banks]
Yeah! I'm here nigga, Banks!!! G-G-G-G-G-G Unit!!!

Now don't try to stand next to me (Right)
'Cause I'm the nigga they came here to see (Right)
Ain't nothin round here for free (Right)
And I'm here to let these motherfuckers know
That I'll do anything for the dough (Right)
A felony walkin out the front do' (Right)
Ain't a motherfucker I gotta change fo' (Right)
Therefore I'm a be this way until I go

Yeah! Guess who walk around with diamond chains and rings on 'em
A pair of throwback Jordan's, with the wings on 'em
With all this talking I'm guessin they got them things on 'em
'Cause if not Milli's the Forty Cal's a ring on 'em

I know your kind gettin by leave the city quick
Niggaz bleed just like us I'm on that Biggie shit
First of all I'm sup-posed to ball
I'm sup-posed to have coast to, coast to calls

And your niggaz on your cd's garbage
Yeah they shootin but they missin, sprayin up the wall like graffiti artist
Some niggaz by the bootleg but go and cop the real shit
'Cause the fans love us I'm nicer than grandmothers

I wake up get dressed put on my tan butters
It been this way since Puma's and Super Man cover's
A ice pick could do your liver harm
And have you screamin in the back of the club louder than Lil' Jon

Now don't try to stand next to me (Right)
Cause I'm the nigga they came here to see (Right)
Ain't nothin round here for free (Right)
And I'm here to let these motherfuckers know
That I'll do anything for the dough (Right)
A felony walkin out the front do' (Right)
Ain't a motherfucker I gotta change fo' (Right)
Therefore I'm a be this way until I go

You now lookin at the hood meal ticket seven thou on my wrist
It's kinda hard to keep the balance with this
It keeps the challengers pissed
I vacate to different islands and twist

And back home where the violence exist, now silencers fixed
You buy mileage as gifts as well as man's best friend
And I don't own no rottweillers and pits
It's getting extremely hard for the man to roam

With little kids putting this picture on the camera phone
Shit change now that the cameras on
A bitch will jeopardize the marriage to fuck you when they man is gone
These niggaz ramblin on about the paper that they getting stop it

I got more money than you in my little pocket
Yeah I'm stingy so it's stretch long
With G-Unit sweats on thread needle to Teflon
Des'Eagle and vest on, cause everybody ain't enthused
That's your name's around about good news, FUCK YOU!!!

The Alchemist,"Uh, yeah, yeah, yo, it goes tick tock
This is for my niggaz in the bridge, blocks
Comin' through better hide your wrist watch
Because niggaz, well, live they shits pop

Hey, hey, tick tock, this is for my hoes
Make your hips rock
Light a L, baby, let the Crys' pop
Get your tick tock from this hip hop, any day

5-8 with double-X-L, pen saggin' blunts draggin'
But never lived well, imagine, a felon on a two-way street
One way is where blood money coke and homicide leap
The other street opportunity, the chance to live sweet
Think positive k-nowledgement k-cypher complete

So you can be an architect, design apartments and shit
Or you can wind up on a jail bus dirty in clip
Soon as I'm on the set, I'm never on a chick, I play it cool
But still ain't pussy muscles get wet, it's just the booze

Check my niggaz, what's the gossip, what's the word
Puff some herb, all I see is niggaz runnin', chin shots
All I heard, dip behind the car, see somebody on the ground
Ambulance came and got 'em they start calmin' down

Now it's back to the same old shit
You know, the Tarzan and Jane-o shit
In the jungle swingin' on vines
I saw the gat with the same old clip
Another nigga layin' the hit

Bloodied up, screamin', I'm dyin'
I be in Queens where the famous hood rats and ghetto stars are
Pimps do the shuffle at night with slutty bars pah

Tick tock, this is for my niggaz in the bridge, blocks
Comin' through, better hide your wrist watch
Because niggaz, well, live they shits popped

Hey hey, tick tock, this is for my hoes
Make your hips rock
Light a L, baby, let the Crys pop
Get your tick tock from this hip hop, any day

It's like this nigga, it's on, toilet up for me, roll that shit big
While I reveal the story of a wild street kid
Cock your seat back, relax, while I spit
The spittin' image of how I live

Well, first I was hollyin' for years by them old timer clicks
I was like twelve, they was like, blood, listen
""Keep your mouth closed and your eyes and your ears wide open""
Gangsta, I soaked it all in, my first ammo was a one shot

Deuce, deuce, had my pockets full of bullets, I was real loose
Thug parties out in wave crash, always got shot up
Thug parties out in Queens bridge, always got shot up

No wonder we bugged out it gets so frantic
Niggaz aim on the fight, we cut yo melon
Drinkin' that old English Red Bull and Blue Bull
Mean I draggin' with that cheap shit, fuck it, we was broke

Little bad ass, my nigga rap sat me down, like this
He said, ""P, you gon' wind up dead
You and Hav' real good with that music shit
You need to stick to it, dunn, get your mind off the street""

And it stuck in the back of my head
Though I still did my little bit of menacin'
Every now and then bang-outs in broad daylight
Like these things really happen
Niggaz get cut up, I put it in my rappin'

It's non fiction, it's the real deal fiscal
It couldn't get more graphic, I'm so trail
I said, it's non fiction it's the real deal fiscal
City you havin', let me touch that ass

So tick tock, this is for my niggaz in the bridge, blocks
Comin' through better hide your wrist watch
Because niggaz well live they shits popped

Hey hey, tick tock, this is for my hoes

I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

As I go, remember all the simple things you know,
My mind is just a crutch and I still hope, that you will miss me when
I'm gone
This is the last song

The hearts start breaking as the year is gone
The dream's beginning and the time rolls on
It seems so surreal, now I sing it.
Somehow I knew that I would be this way,
Somehow I knew that I would slowly fade.
Now I'm gone, just try and stop me now.

And will you need me now, you'll find a way somehow
You want it too, I want it too.",The Last Song
The All-American Rejects,"Please just don't play with me My paper heart will bleed
This wait for destiny won't do
Be with me please I beseech you
Simple things, that make you run a-way
Catch you if I can

Tears fall, down your face
The taste, is something new
Something that I know
Moving on is, easiest when I am around you.

So bottle up old love,
And throw it out to sea,
Watch it away as you cry
Now a year has past
The seasons go

Please just don't play with me
My paper heart will bleed
This wait for destiny won't do
Be with me please I beseech you
Simple things, that make you run a-way
Catch you if I can

Waiting, day to day it goes through
My lips, are sealed for her
My tongue is,
Tied to, a dream of being with you
To settle for less, is not what I prefer

Summer time, the nights they are so long
The leaves fall down, and so do I into
the arms of a friend
Winter nights
My bedside is cold, for I am gone
And spring blossoms you to me",My Paper Heart

One more, sad song, tears shed, she's gone
She'd take it back, if she only could

She's gone
You wish that you could learn to see,
The door is closed and you wish you could be

Alone with you, alone with me
What can I do, I can not breath
My heart is torn, for all to see
Alone with you, alone with me.

Friend deceives, she leaves
Last date. she cries, whispers, goodbye

Me the burdens bitter taste

Monogamy's not a part of me

And I know my line and is just a sin

I'm not making any friends

We can't deny the things we do
I can't believe her pretty feet walked over me
All over me

Help me, help me doctor
Seems to be an awful lot for me to understand
I know I'm not a specimen,
The troubles and the mess I'm in
I should be dead
He said, let's all start think
Then you've had all your fun
It's time to be a man
So you better quit your bitchin'
Think about what the people would say

It's not on me, it's all on you
I can't prescribe what you want me to
You need some sleep, you better leave
He walked over me
All over me

Wait until tomorrow, and it's gone
So long
Wait until tomorrow, so long
And it's gone
Wait until tomorrow
You beg and steal and borrow till it's gone

(He don't got a lot but he's got all he needs)
I need someone to love
(And all he's got well it's all that he needs)
Somebody help me cause I could hear the voices in the tube
To get me through anything I do and anything will do good by me
A little pill, a little thrill, should I take it I think I will
And anything will do good so as long as it's always too good
Either way I don't give a damn what you people all say
All now boy

It's not on me, it's all on you
I can't deny the things I do
I can't believe her pretty feet walked over me

The Allman Brothers Band,"Got on a bus in Memphis
Destination Rome
Georgia ain't no paradise
But a place I just call home

I sat next to a broken hearted bride
She was cryin', tryin' so hard to hide
Her selfish sorrow

I tried to get her talkin'
She didn't have much to say
She asked me for a map to death row
But I didn't know the way

She had lost a million in the game
One look out the window
At the pine trees and the rain
It wasn't her day

Multicolored lady
You ain't like no rainbow I've ever seen
Multicolored lady
Angry red, passion blue
But mostly shades of green

Midnight came and brought more rain
Nothing seemed to ease her pain
The hours that we talked
Seemed like minutes all in vane

I watched
As her tears kept runnin' wide
Bye and bye and bye, way back after a while
She started smilin'

Multicolored lady
You ain't like no rainbow I've ever known
Multicolored lady
Come go with me, I'll take you to my home

Oh, by the way, I'm bound for Rome

The Allman Brothers Band,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know

The Allman Brothers Band,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""

Wouldn't stand back, for neither love nor money

She put up a sign and my house began to wail

She had such a way to fool me, Lord she had a way to fool me
And I would ask the woman, can you find it in yourself to please stand back?

Well it's so easy to give advice, 
When you ain't the one who got to pay the price.
Sit up there on your hill telling me I got to sink or swim.
Well it might thrill you, to make me want to kill ya, 
I can't believe you're leavin' me for him,
I got a right to be wrong.

Oh, loan me a dollar and watch me follow you around,
You got all the moves, you're puttin' me through school.
Oh, I give you my best, but I guess I'm still your fool,
Babe, I got you down in my song.
I got a right to be wrong.

I've been con-flicted, e-victed, re-stricted, 
Served with a letter sent to whom it may concern,
Still around Lord, I'm still in town, 
A lesson hard learned nearly got me down,
It's a cryin' shame, you don't even know my name,
A low down lonesome song,
I got a right to be wrong.

The Allman Brothers Band,"The words are the thunder
The thought is the lightning
The telling of the tale is the storm
The defendant must be guilty
As he waits impatiently
As the wooden stake is driven
And the angel sounds the horn
 
The cornered Lion is not within the realm of reason
Fear is like the cracking of the lash
You want to run, you want to fight
Lightning flashes in the night
You finally turn away to hide your face
As the judges file in to take their places
 
You got to hold your ground
Hold your ground like a man
Sometimes you've just got to hold your ground
When the truth has finally been tasted
You can tell them all their time has not been wasted

A lovely wife and children, all the things worth fighting for. 
He knows, there was still, still, something missing in his life.
Though he promised to be faithful, he was good at telling lies. 
He had an eye for young girls, he would steal some on the side. 
Oh no, he just could not be satisfied. 
It's a game of all or nothing, there is nowhere safe to run, 
Someone might just pull the trigger, cause temptation is a gun. 
He met her at a night club, on the other side of town. 
Somehow he could not resist her, she's the best he'd ever found. 
She knows, she found her ticket to the other side. 
It's a game of all or nothing, there is nowhere safe to run, 
Someone might just pull the trigger, cause temptation is a gun. 
His foolish ways seem harmless, but his world was so divine, 
Cause at home they know his secrets, they've heard all his alibis. 
As he tries to face his feelings, he can't justify his crimes, 
Now comes the final ending, of the dreams he once held sacred deep inside. 
He can kiss it all good-bye.

And most all your would be friends
Turn out so phoney

And rearrange

Or how to stop

And after things have come and gone
Left me feelin'
That I've done so wrong
Oh, I wasted so much time
Feelin' guilty
And as I watch you sit across the room
Beautiful as the flowers bloom
T'Leave it lay just one day
Oh brother you're gonna come back
To find it gone

Just tell me where
To start
Where now baby
Tell me where to start

And after all that we've been through
I find that when I think of you
A warm soft wind runs
Through and through

And I will always keep on trying
To gather this strange piece of mind
Without it there'd be

And I didn't draw the card I needed
So, I proceeded to bang it on down the line
Hitchhike, turnpike
And if you got room, won't you let me ride?
Just as far as you're going 
And, Lord knowing, I'll be much obliged
 
There was a light rain falling
I started recalling how lonesome a man can be
Feeling a chill when over the hill 
Came a brand new baby blue Cadillac
Stop on a dime
I threw my guitar in the back, and I climbed inside
Big blue eyes said, ""Hey, boy, don't you want a ride?""
 
I said, ""To Birmingham, Alabama
Or to Nashville, Tennessee will do just fine with me
Don't you know what I mean?
I'm coming from New Orleans
Now, hey
Mama, won't you let me ride?""
 
Well, now, black fur coat, diamond ring 
Shining like something I ain't ever seen
My old guitar and a roadside bar
Walked in the door looking like a movie queen
There was a honky-tonk jukebox, hardwood floor
She said,  ""I ain't ever seen nothing like this before.""
I said, ""That's all right, mama, won't you let me ride?""

Said you'd just dumped your old man
Then the next time you was dealin'

Making up your own rules
Must be some kind of crazy
let you fool me twice
I don't know why
I keep playing with loaded dice 
 
Well, tonight I hit the jackpot
I was shining like a diamond ring
Lady luck was smiling
And the old snake charmer was doing his thing
 
You saw the tables turn 
man it sure felt nice
Now we see who's laughing
Now we see who's playing with the loaded dice 
 
Girl you ain't like nothing

And I make my living pouring out my pain
Trying to make it through another day
Arms reach for me on the wind I can feel them
They're a thousand miles away

And I won't feel myself till I'm with you

In an ocean of lies
Trying to find a reason to make the hole thing right
Will make you old before your time

It was an oyster at my feet
Dancing to my own drum, fishing out the pearl
Yes I would have been much more discreet

I've lived a lifetime, acting out apart
It's been a long uphill climb
now all the things that use to mean so much to me
Has made me old before my time

Wondering aimlessly, wondering down
Would it ever be much different now
Remind me of the past, I slip into a dream
Funny things ain't never what they seem

Living like children, never doing what we are told
Would not hesitate to take to take a chance
That road behind me now was paved with fool’s gold
It's almost time for the victory dance

No more feeling guilty, for things I never did
Feeling nothing for my crime

May be sometimes then ya don't

The Allman Brothers Band,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

That got you through the cloudy days
When the stars ain't shinin' bright

Like a woman has robbed him of his very soul

The Almighty RSO,"[ VERSE 1: Tony Rome ]
16 days and I wake up and I'm outta here
It's been hell since I got in here
Now I'm back on the streets where the problems that I left still remain
Nothing seemed to change
So I'm right back where I started
No j-o-be	 to make ends meet
I'm gettin change on the streets
But this ain't how I planned it, I'm trippin
I can feel myself slippin
From the beginnin I been tryin to get a grip, but I can't grab hold
24 years old and I'm out here on my own
Yo, I'm slowly losin my mind
Nobody knows the pain I been holdin up inside
Buildin up insid is enough shit to hurt ya, it's torture
When your mind tries to desert ya, no one to support ya
For some of y'all life has been a fantasy
And I been livin up in hell, nigga, lookin for my sanity

[ CHORUS: D-Ruff ]
All I want is my sanity
Although it might seem I'm goin insane

[ VERSE 2: Raydog ]
I wake up every morning, nigga, get up
But this time I grab my nine just in case I gotta tear up
Hard times all around
Still I'm surrounded by the stress but I don't never let it keep me down
Make no mistake, I'll be a dog till I die
I'm always livin on the edge and I wonder why
See, motherfuckers want to kill me, but that's aight
Cause when I go in, niggaz still screamin ""RSO""
Until that time I lived my life day for day
Never knowin when another nigga gonna try to (kill Ray)
So now I'm thinkin to myself is it really all worth it
No, better yet, do I deserve this
Way of life I been given, I been livin wrong
All I want to do is see my son grow strong
So please God, watch over my family
Cause when I die, I wannna die with my sanity

[ CHORUS: D-Ruff ]
All I want is my sanity
Although it might seem I'm goin insane

[ VERSE 3: E. Devious ]
It's hard to maintain and keep a sane frame of mind
When my life's like a battery low on alkaline
I be feelin like I be in a room
And all four walls be closin in for doom
I try to escape the mental manslaughter
I feel like that dude when Jaws was in a water
I can't seem to redeem all my traction
Too many trife niggaz around me to be relaxin
Gotta watch those who I'm 'posed to trust
Don't want to but I'll haunt you if I have to bust
To protect my welfare
You clowns tryin to bring me down'll catch hell here
I won't falter, you can't halt a
Devilish mind when I climb behind the altar
People, stay calm, I'll be real brief
I puff weed from the Philly blunt leaf
And if they torment the E any further
Insanity'll be my plea bargain for murder
Born in hell under a spell called calamity
All I want is my sanity

[ CHORUS: D-Ruff ]
All I want is my sanity
Although it might seem I'm goin insane
My whole life's been filled with calamity
So how can I ease the pain",Sanity

But she told him that we must attend to her needs
She's so much younger than you
Well, he ran out in the hall and he cried
Oh, how he was scared to die
When they said he was an only son
He thought he was the only one

Oh, what a lonely boy
Oh, what a lonely boy
Oh, what a lonely boy

Goodbye mother, goodbye youth
Goodbye father, I'm pushing on through

He left home on a winter day in 2009
And he hoped to find all the love he had lost in that earlier time
Well, his seek turned to love and she made him a man
She gave him a son, oh, yeah, a lovely son
They dressed him up poorly and they sent him to school
It taught him how to fight, nobody's fool

Oh, what a lonely boy
Oh, what a lonely boy
Oh, what a lonely boy

Oh, what a lonely boy
Oh, what a lonely boy
Oh, what a lonely boy

Oh, what a lonely boy",Lonely Boy
The Aloof,"They're not making the skies as blue this year, wish you were here
As blue as they used to when you were near, wish you were here
And the mornings don't seem as new
Brand-new as they did with you
Wish you were here, wish you were here, wish you were here

Someone's painting the leaves all wrong this year, wish you were here
And why did the birds change their song this year, wish you were here
They're not shining the stars as bright
They've stolen the joy from the night
Wish you were here, wish you were here, wish you were here

The Aloof,"The system has got me weak 
My words could not explain
The incisions far too deep
But why should I complain
I only live the life
I walk in crowded rooms
The air I can't consume cause all I want is you
Cause all I want is you
Cause all I want is you
Cause all I want is you
Cause all I want is you

The balance has tipped 
To my emotions are short
I look at what I have
And see what I have not
I only live the life
I walk in crowded rooms
The air I can't consume cause all I want is you
Cause all I want is you
Cause all I want is you
Cause all I want is you
Cause all I want is you

I lived with my mind
Completely disturbted 
By the way you live your life
You looked just so absurb
I only live the life
I walk in crowded rooms
The air I can't consume cause all I want is you

Cause all I want is you
Cause all I want is you
Cause all I want is you
Cause all I want is you

The Alpha Conspiracy,"Another day is a waste of your life, she said
I can't wander looking for your dream today
One two a river unseen by the waste in your life

Another break in your way is a sign, she says
I look forward, watch you eat your words today
Run to the look in your darkened eyes
Still they're alive

Another day is a step towards grey, she says
I just wonder if she'll ever be today
Run to the winter cold embrace
Stealing my life

Another running away is your sign, she says
I look forward, watch the sky recede today
One two a fateful turn away
Sealing our lives

I'm lost in your eyes again 
Once I met your gaze 
And find the way 
The way to be cold again ",Winter
The Alphabet Girls,"Take me now, baby, here as I am
Pull me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

Come on now try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand come undercover
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Have I doubt when I'm alone
Love is a ring, the telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed until the morning comes

Come on now try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't touch you now
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

With love we sleep
With doubt the vicious circle
Turn and burns
Without you I cannot live
Forgive, the yearning burning
I believe it's time, too real to feel

So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Because tonight there are two lovers
If we believe in the night we trust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust

Because the night
Belongs to lovers
Because the night
Belongs to us",Because the Night
