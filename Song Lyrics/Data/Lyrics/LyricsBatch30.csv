Cornershop,"My sweet child, lay your head down
Dream the dreams that delight you
You're safe now and forever
Don't let reality blind you

My sweet child, taste the starlight
Reach your hands up to heaven
Share your dreams with the moonlight
Cherish all you've been giving

There's nothing to fear
Soon the day will appear
There's nothing to say 
Just as long as you pray

[Chorus]
It's in the eyes of the Candy Man
He owns the dark
It's in the eyes of the Candy Man
He owns the dark

May the night never find you
With a heart full of sorrow
You can close your tired eyes
Dream your dreams of tomorrow

There's nothing to fear
Soon the day will appear
Here comes the daylight
There's nothing to say
Just as long as you pray
Don't be afraid

[Chorus]

We're living in a cruel world, cruel world
Living in a cruel world, cruel world
Living in a cold dark space were we hide our face
We're living in a cruel world, cruel world
Living in a cruel world, cruel world
Don't be afraid

[Chorus]

Go to sleep
Close your eyes",Candy Man
Cornershop,"Well, it seems like the funky days, they're back again
Funky, funky days, they're back again
And we're in vogue again
Before the gurkers get called up again

Seems like the funky days, they're back again
And the party's got a double E at the end again
We'll be armed in dungareen cords again
Happy days are here again, my friend

Been a long journey, long, long times
Many roads we couldn't climb
But once again, the name of the game is funky
And it's funky again
Seems like the funky days are back again
Funky with a why and it's back again and back again

We'll be wearin' dungareen cords again
Walkin' down that road with a smile on our faces
We'll be walkin' naked, hand in hand, down that road
With a smile on our faces, holdin' only embraces
Embraces to hold us 'cause we're getting funky again
And we're funky again

Seems like those funky days are back again
My friends will be wearing dungareen cords
Walkin' down that road again
When we say party, we mean it to end on the double E

Funky roads are back again
Funky drinks are back again
Zip-zap guns are back again
Big shoes are back again
Tax in the post is back again
Worker strikes are back again

And we'll be, and we'll be doin' the airplane wheel, dancin'
Swingin' like an airplane wheel, dancin'
Dancin' like the airplane wheel, movin'
Funky days are back again, my friends
And funky days are back again

Ben, you just show them how funky it can get
When funky days are back in vogue again
",Funky Days Are Back Again
Cornershop,"I'm feeling good behind the wheel
I know it won't be too long
Two foots racing and the man made blues
I feel the magic of the man and the ghost

Checking out the animal heads in the animal kingdom
Taking acts on through the turbulent sea
It?s the truth, it?s the truth, make it be tree

To the chorus now, it'll always be tough
A beach Manhattan from the middle of the heart

I want each and all to switch your tiny mind on
I want each and all switch on your tiny mind
I want each and all to switch your tiny mind on
I want each and all switch on your tiny mind

'Cause good shit's all around good people
Don't let it get you down, good people
Good shit's all around, it?s all about, it's all around

Good shit's all around good people
Don't let it get you down, good people
Good shit's all around, it?s all about

Good people now, good shit, I'm on fire
Directing traffic on the disco floor

Well, one by one, we're gonna take you lovers on and
One by one, we're gonna take you lovers on
Eastern claps on the one and the third, and I'm thinking
It?s a mighty God, we serve

Good shit, I'm on fire

let's been waiting, I don't give up on a good thing
Heavy metal from the back of a stage
Walk into interstate with the worst attorney that helped me
Making old your mothers day

To the chorus now, it'll always be tough
A beach Manhattan from the middle of the heart

I want you each and all to switch your tiny mind on
I want you each and all switch on your tiny mind
I want you each and all to switch your tiny mind on
I want you each and all switch on your tiny mind

'Cause good shit's all around good people
Don't let it get you down, good people
Good shit's all around, it?s all about, it's all around

Good shit's all around good people
Don't let it get you down, good people
Good shit's all around, it?s all about

Good people now, good shit, I'm on fire

And it?s the triple route, it?s the truth, it?s the truth
And it?s the triple route, it?s the truth, it?s the truth
And it?s the triple route, it?s the truth, it?s the truth
It?s the truth, it?s the truth

Leave the right side free
Hope gets salted
As those around you leave

we're gonna let it up
Like India House on fire
We're gonna let it go
And let it go higher
Let it go

Sleep on the left side
Houcam is our call
We're gonna take it
That virgin fall

there's gonna be some
When we let it up and let it breathe
And all the holes doused with grief
And planets up and time to leave

No Asian fire will leave us dire
Born again to Asian lion
There comes no telling how it will be
What's turned to smoke was in our hearts
And planets up, what we have lost

Foot racing from kitchens
Down alleys through gullys
Meeting every second hour
Never to come to terms with the [Incomprehensible]

Foot racing to Putabin Key
'Cause there's too much going on
To jeer on green goddesses
Local dignitaries and labor counselors
Always in touch by way of the community organ
We're about to be orphaned

Sleep on the left side
Keep the sword hand free
Whatever is gonna be
Is gonna be

For the 7th time
Without tumbling desire
Easy disease
We're gonna let it known
And let it go slow, let it go

Sleep on the left side
Sleep on the left side

Some sounds, some burdens can release
Some sounds, some burdens can release
Some sounds, some burdens

At San Quentin they jailed him one evening late
But out on the ocean John did escape
'Cause the guards forgot to close the Golden Gate

Well, they offered a reward to bring him back
Even put bloodhounds on his track
Those doggone bloodhounds lost his scent
Now nobody knows where John went

So they chased him with a submarine

Coroner,"Falling down, entering no-where,
Between our world and the realm of death.
I'm a drifter through unknown lands.
Search for an exit out of this place.

The gift of life, so fragile it was.
Squeezed between and machines.
And plastic tubes.
Want to talk but I can't.
Want to move but I'm nailed to the ground.

Child of the moon, coma of light.
See myself from above, await for a final decision. 
Child of the moon, coma of light.
See myself from above, await for a final decision. 

Falling down, entering no-where,
Between our world and the realm of death.
I'm a drifter through unknown lands.
Search for an exit out of this place.

So I lay here, going insane.
What was in the past?
No one knows how to get me out. 
They just stand around my bed.
Fill me up with all kinds of drugs
But I know there is a way.
Switch off the machine to let me go.
Let me sleep this time for real.

Child of the moon, coma of light.
See myself from above, await for a final decision.",Coma
Coroner,"Now I lay here
Surrounded by darkness
And I really don't know
Is this reality? Or is it just a dream""

Smell of death morbid smell, what else can it be?
No anymore, my lips are blue. Nothing 
Walls are moving, deep inside, I don't care about death
The sun's far away, no hope any more, no chance, I can't get out

Everything I needed before, is unimportant now
I don't need no prayers now, just give back the light
I won't cry not anymore, nobody can give me help
Rotten flowers between my hands, remembrance of my life

Tears are rolling it's time to say goodbye
Death brings a smile and R.I.P.

Forgotten time, forgotten sense, my mind is paralyzed
Rats and worms, left as friends. They're eating me away
Spider webs on my hands, all wrapped up in chains
I am sure I'll see again, your days are numbered too",R.I.P.
Coroner,"Now I'm up,ready to die
Gun in my heart, death in my brain
My home is death, is now.

Killing and dying is 
The old death's gone, die.

The one way ticket to Hell.

Hunting, seeking, finding, destroying die.
Praying, pleading, cannot wait for death. 
Hunting, seeking, finding, destroying die.
Praying, pleading, cannot wait for death.

There's no return,
""He snakes inside""
I'm racing as fast as I can.
The sun's on my back,
And death's in front.

The moment is right, to go down and die,
And make a request for my heart.
Waiting for it, deliverance is here.

And children ask for reasons why.
When acid rain burns your skin to shreds,
And children die with open eyes.

Disfigured faces, bleeding disease.
Mutilated bodies - sill alive or almost dead.

Time to realize what they've done to us.
It makes no sense to protect yourself.

Disfigured faces, bleeding disease.
Mutilated bodies - sill alive or almost dead.

Chemical holocaust, invisible death.
Destruction as far as you can see.
Die right off.
Breathing deep, killing death winds.

Nuclear fall-out, comes down like snow.
And the radiation begins to kill.
When the whole history of this planet,
Seems to be forgotten.",When Angels Die
Coroner,"I have to forget, push things from my head
I've got to leave that past of blood and tears
My brain injected, information infected
I'm absorbed lost in my storm

I've got to stop and clear my conscience
I've got to look for another direction
My arms out stretched, my hands touch nothing
I'm absorbed by the fog of my lies

You're out there somewhere
Outside getting on with life
I'm in here nowhere
Inside looking for a key

So what can I do to find myself
Which way is right, which way is left
Direction undiscovered, my body exhausted
I'm absorbed totally confused",Absorbed

Coroner,"I saw his face, on every channel
His slogans in all the papers
I heard people, repeat his words
I saw them shouting, his flag in their hands

I saw him making promises
I heard him talk about life
But I saw his fingers too
They were crossed behind his back

Darling of the TV screen
Manipulator of the purse strings
Master of the spoken words
Jackal with connections

Worshipped by the masses
Leader with ulterior motives

(All talk and no do)
(Is neither a good offense or defense)
(Get with it boys and girls)
(Your house needs to be put in order too)

His slate, clean as snow
Covers over his dark past
To be in league with workers
Pictures he loved to see

But I read in his eyes

Coroner,"I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's happened to you

But you can't hear
'Cause we're so far apart

I'd like to understand
What's going on deep in your mind
Why you've destroyed the spell
And how you can be so cool 'bout that

Or just a shadow, of a dream I lost",Shadow of a Lost Dream
Coroner,"So you've had enough of all that waste around you

High above the clouds far from reality

I'm here to please
Skeleton on your shoulder
I'll bring you to your knees

Skeleton on your shoulder
I'll show you your greed
Skeleton on your shoulder

You will spend all you have to stay with Her Majesty

Coroner,"Wake up step out of your dream come out of the mire
Realize what they do think about what you do
Is this what I live for or a dream I die for
Where is the sense what's the price you pay

Did you see their faces beaten to obey
Did you see the colours sulphur yellow, concrete gray
Did you see the eyes listless and indifferent
Oppression no resistance bodies without a spine

Sometimes they talk behind your back
Is he your friend who do you trust
How far can we go who sets all the limits
Who gives us rights we've never wanted?

To build a world called decadence

Sitting at my controls watching those flashing lights

Red light alarm the air is going bad
I lie back untie my belts everything is blurred

And the moon is melting my skin
Water turns to fire
And flames are freezing to ice

I won't go till I've tasted dark wine
Made out of deepest sorrow
Absorbing winds of suffering
On fields of blood and tears

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

This is where I long to be

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Corrinne May,"""When will you be home?"" she asks
As we watch the planes take off
We both know we have no clear answer to where my dreams may lead
She's watched me as I crawled and stumbled
As a child, she was my world
And now to let me go, I know she bleeds
And yet she says to me

You can fly so high
Keep your gaze upon the sky
I'll be prayin' every step along the way
Even though it breaks my heart to know we'll be so far apart
I love you too much to make you stay
Baby fly away

Silver-painted hair
Daddy called one evening saying
""We need you. Please come back""

Pale just like an angel taking flight
I held her as I cried

Fight to the death over one last seed

Sometimes I pray to an unmoving void
For the day that I may close my eyes to the horror which fills inside me

I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?

She said please say you got a car

It's parked out back
It's pointed out of state
It's a recent acquisition we should probably ditch the plates

And it won't get you far enough to ever lose track
But yeah it's plenty car enough for never coming back

They say it makes it stronger
But first you gotta survive
What didn't kill you will make you wish you died

Yellow duffel in the seat back yonder
Bunch of pretty junk I bought her

It's yours if you want
I believe in the flame
But to me it's the same

She said no thanks man my baggage is packed
This name on my ankle with this knife in my back

I know a place on the way out of town
It's as good as burned down
It's as good as burned down

They say it makes it stonger

Cory Heydon,"Nobody on the road,
Nobody on the beach.
I feel it in the air,
The summer's out of reach.
Empty lake, empty streets,
The sun goes down alone.
I'm driving by your house
Don't know you're not home.

But I can see you,
Your brown skin shining in the sun.
You got your hair combed back
And your sunglasses on, baby.
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone.

I never will forget those nights.
I wonder if it was a dream.
Remember how you made me crazy,
Remember how I made you scream.
I don't understand what happened to our love.
But, baby, I'm gonna get you back,
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of.

I can see you,
Your brown skin shining in the sun.
I see you walking real slow 
And you're smiling at everyone.
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone.

Out on the road today I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac.
A little voice inside my head said:
""Don't look back, you can never look back.""
I thought I knew what love was.
What did I know?
Those days are gone forever.
I should just let 'em go, but

I can see you,
Your brown skin shining in the sun.
You got that top pulled down,
And that radio on, baby.
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong,
After the boys of summer have gone.

Cory Heydon,"He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Coming home to a place he'd never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door

When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
On the road and hanging by a song
But the string's already broken and he doesn't really care
It keeps changing fast and it don't last for long

But the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye
Rocky mountain high (Colorado)

He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept his memory

Now he walks in quiet solitude the forest and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

And the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky mountain high

Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land

And the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
I know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly
Rocky mountain high

It's Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

My homie Marley used to stay, 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin, 16 he was stuntin
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin 'em all
With the girls a lotta flirtin involved, but dawg
Fuck all that flirtin, I'm tryna get in some drawers, so

Trunk open, screens on, neon's lit with fifth relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fo's crawlin', you see them screens fallin
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin
I'm leanin on the switch, sittin crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hardhitter all about the scrilla
Ridin somethin candy coated, crawlin like a caterpillar
I'm tippin on them four's, I'm jammin on that Screw

I got the baller genetics baby it's evident
You see a player flickin, and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, ""Just a Lil' Bit"" (just a lil' bit)

My canaries is gleamin, through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smokin on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes

Shit and all they got is rappin to listen to

Even when the condition is critical, when the livin is miserable
Your position is pivotal, I ain't bullshittin you
Now, why would I lie? just to get by?
Just to get by, we get fly
The tv got us reachin for stars
Not the ones between venus and mars, the ones that be readin for parts
Some people get breast enhancements and penis enlargers
Saturday sinners Sunday morning at the feet of the father
They need somethin to rely on, we get high on all types of drug
When, all you really need is love
To get by just to get by

Change your face or the bullets change all that for you

Who you thank you dealing with?
They call me Chris, nigga I been making threats
Since I been in kindergarten nigga!
Huh, ask about me, see if you ain't heard

When the gun is tucked, untucked, nigga you dies
Like nunchucks held by the Jet L-I
I'm the one, thus meaning no one must try
No two, no three, no four, know why?
Because one's four-five might blow yo' high
You ain't gotta go to church to get to know yo' God
It's a match made in heaven when I 'splay the 7
Put you on the nigga news, UPN at 11

They tellin' me, ""Bun don't go there""
But, man, I just gots to bring it.
These niggas, they wanna hate on that Texas,
But scared to sing it.
They don't know what that star 'bout
They don't know what that bar 'bout
They don't know what that candy car 'bout
Or smokin' that joint 'bout.
All they know is what the fuck I tell 'em
Or what the fuck we sell 'em
Smokin' Swishers, wood grain,
And leavin' stains on cerebellums.
Rebellum, propell 'em, gel 'em
From P.A. to Deep Ellum.
Tell 'em I tol' 'em
Wrote 'em, fuck it, phone 'em

I just spent 60 G's
On a brand new Eldo-reeze,
Black-on-black, drop top 'lac,
Northstar fifth wheel on back.
Sometimes I feel like Lil' Ke
When my trunk steady hummin'
Had to leave my bitch
'Cause I fell in love with my chrome-plated woman.
I love my wood wheel Grant,
'84 Cadillacs that slant,
Slowed-down Screw tapes that knock,
Blowin' on Green private stock.
Bitch, I don't eat hamhocks,
Try 20-ounce Angus beef.
Hangin' with young niggas, that pack big triggas,
'N got big-ass diamonds off in they teeth.

Fifth wheel and grill (fifth wheel and grill),
Candy Seville (candy Seville),
Might pop a pill, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel (workin' wood wheel).
House on the hill (house on the hill),
Flexin' mils (flexin' mils),
Countin' up my scrill, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel.
Comin' down so trill (comin' down so trill),
Nigga, how you feel (Nigga, how you feel)?
Might pop a pill, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel.

Smokin' on bionic, ubonic chronic, it's so ironic.
Sippin' gin and tonic, supersonic like Johnny Mneumonic.
We crash your party, piss on your parade,
Sip syrup like it's Lemonade
From Paris to the Palisades to the Promenade
Bomb and fade, closes the car, break worlds, it's plain as day.
That's the game we came to play,
It don't change, ain't a thing to say.

[Pimp C]
It's goin' down in the H-Town,
Young playa from the South 'bout to blaze a pound,
Tryin' to find me a bopp with some good mouth
I know you freaky bitches know what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Ain't got no time to play, girl;
Let me get a little throwed off some good skunk.
Bitch, didn't you know who the fuck I was,
Off in the street, lookin' for the good stuff?
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about yo' man, so
Bitch tryin' to fuck fast, I'ma fuck slow.
How the fuck you're gonna out-fuck James, ho?
Like Teddy Pendergrass, you better let it go.

Gettin' ready fo, head doctors, show shockers, body rockers,
Late-night do' knockers
Gotta break us off big pimpin', baby, we ho clockers,
Bitch bosses, takin' no losses, best go ask aks Lil' Wee-wee.
Baby brother, Sweet James Jones, guerilla pimpin' at its finest.
Leavin' haters and ho-hustlers behind us, rewind us

[Pimp C]
Touched like Midas, these bitch-ass niggas they study and bite us.
Couldn't not recite us, come to our show,
And bitch niggas try to fight us.
Ho niggas scream and talk, trill niggas bust and leave
How the fuck you're gonna go to war
When you bitch-ass niggas ain't got no cheese?

Uh, puttin' down one time for the king, Lil' J

Cory Morrow,"She's a waitress right now in some rundown Mickey-Mouse town
But on weekends she's a big city striptease
Now she looks pretty sleek and for a dollar a peek
You can make her acquaintance and then leave

Her papa, he don't know, his little baby takes off her clothes
He don't ever ask how she pays the rent
Yeah, but I go to see her dance at just about every chance
And she leaves me with a feeling it was money well spent

She's a big city stripper and all the cowboys love to tip her
Spendin' their lives in a velvet seat
Five dollars a beer, good gosh, I never-ever want to leave here
She's my big city stripper and I think she's in love with me

Now her life's a sordid wreck, she seldom gets any respect
Yeah, but she's only doing what she loves the most
And my loving her is a task 'cause she's always showing off her class
And she's what all men want from coast to coast

Now, I've spent the last ten years just trying to face my fears
Worried about what all my friends might say
Yeah, but it's kinda fun to dream, I just kick back and drink
I watch her dance and see my troubles stripped away

She's a big city stripper and all the cowboys love to tip her
Spendin' their lives in a velvet seat
Five dollars a beer, good gosh, I never-ever want to leave here

Cory Morrow,"The cold wind blew, the preacher grieved
He said ""they're comin' after me
I ain't exactly what I seem to be""	 
He pulled his pistol from his side
Pointed it at me and cried
And then he laid a bullet deep in my chest
He stood still revealin' the story
That I knew was true before
And now because of it I lay dying
He claimed to run with Jesse James
William Bonnie, and they all the same
""I ain't no preacher man, I was born of fire""

Hey, can't you hear that train coming now?
Rollin' fast down the tracks, to hell they're bound
Well I'm in over my head again
I hear those pistols layin' 	down
And I have taken the lives of many men
Now the angel's comin' down
I said the angel of death is coming down

Well, up in the horizon
Laid the red sun, beatin' cold and dying
And taking with it all the lives the preacher stole
Well, you see, the preacher is not real
He clench his fists of rage and steel
And spit the fires of Satan at your soul
He beat the path to Heaven's door
The angels said they'd take no more
Now he walks the Earth forever lone
And on the stone that marked his death
When he did finally lay to rest
Were the lonely words ""I'm going home""",The Preacher (Intro)

Down by the Green River, where Paradise lay
Well I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in askin'

And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

Didn't get to sleep that night till the morning came around

Set out running but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

I ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

Set out running but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air

Set out running but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie and she's my heart's delight
Second one is prison, baby, sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
First one says she's got my child but it don't look like me

Hang around with all my friends, and roam the streets til dawn breaks again
I come in at five a.m. and she is waiting for me
She said where have you been, I said I was out,
She said you're no good cause you're running without love

Met down at the laundrmat and tried to make me understand

About what they might have heard
And running down and shouted out it seemed

Next door a girl she lives about the same age as me
And asked me to come upstairs for a see

Just then her mother burst in said your that son of a bitch in the wind
Get out of my house and hit the road
And I kept falling like a Rolling Stones song

The stars came out and warned me so
As I walked on down the road

Por que estaré realizando unos cambios en mi vida
Pero si lo deseas déjame tu nombre tu numero de teléfono y un breve mensaje 
Que a la mayor brevedad, se te devolviera la misma
Si no devuelvo la llamada es porque uno de esos cambios eres tu

Beba este na soy yo te eh llamado un montón de veces
Te eh dejado un montón de mensaje si quieres me llama o cojee el teléfono
Es José quiero hablar contigo

Ey mami es Coscu perdona que te llame privado es que llevo como tres meses
Tirándote y no has contestado como tu has estado?
Yo me imagino que bien dime si todavía estas oliendo al trabajo en el tren
O si tienes novio quizá por eso es que ni te consigo
Que yo sigo y no es que este syko quiero ser tu amigo
Yo quisiera hablarte a veces me miro al espejo
Y lo practico por si conversamos no lucir pendejo
Pero a quien yo engaño?
Yo se que esto me hace daño
Ya te eh cantado cuatro conciertos de Cristian castro en el baño
Bajo la lluvia inclusive le agua fría de mi ducha
Eh llegado hasta el nivel que mis vecinos me escuchan

Me gritan Coscu deja el enfango brother ya no sigas!
Esa gata esta muy dura 'pa ti esta fuera de tu liga
Y todo el mundo dice que tu estas fuera de mi presupuesto
Sin saber que siempre sueño contigo cuando me acuesto

Pienso pienso pienso en ti en ti
Tu amor me saca de la oscuridad
Me lleva hasta la eternidad (sueño contigo)

Pienso pienso pienso en ti en ti
Tu amor me saca de la oscuridad
Me lleva hasta la eternidad

Estas barras que yo tire 'pa ver si te impresiono y quizás me mires
Con los ojos que hacen que todo el día el melón me gire
Yo me esmero le pido a tu prima que me acomode pero ella tira la mala
Ese Coscu que mucho jode !

Madrugada y de noche esta en un cuento de hadas
Yo me pregunto como duermes si con cuantas almohadas
Si tu te arropas o te gusta que te arropen primero
Dime que pensarías si olleras mis voces de Homero
Yo a ti te espero la noche son largas
Y a veces pienso que no hay otra como tu
En este planeta tan inmenso quiero llegar a conocerte
Y a veces le pido a dios 'pa por si el llega a convencerte
Que te explique de bajas y altas que tengo un mundo para ti
Y tu eres la que falta!
Pero por el momento yo sigo matando las horas
Dejándote todo estos mensajes en tu grabadora baby!

La noche no es la misma si no estas aquí
Y en mi mente tu siempre estarás
Si es mi alma que no quiere gritar

Solo me siento yo solo recuerdos del amor
I don't know if you're another love

Pienso pienso pienso en ti en ti
Tu amor me saca de la oscuridad
Me lleva hasta la eternidad

Pienso pienso pienso en ti en ti
Tu amor me saca de la oscuridad
Me lleva hasta la eternidad

Mami
A veces me pongo a pensar en ti
Y lo que me recuerdo son cosas malas 
Y todo el daño que me hiciste 
No te puedo decirte que te deseo lo mejor del mundo

Hoy de nuevo me acuerdo de ti 
Me visita la culpa tu rostro y la vieja pregunta 
Que porque después de tanto me duele mas que nunca?
(Porque me duele tanto)
Cuando pienso en ti, aquellas veces que me hacías sentir 
Como si viajara al mundo contigo
Y aunque me duele en el corazón
(Aunque me duela)
Y me ahogue en un mar de temor
Tratare de vencer el temor
(Y seré el vencedor)
Solo te diré una cosa
(Oye)
Te deseo el mal amor
(Eso es lo que tú te mereces)
Solo te diré una cosa
(Oye) 
Te deseo el mal amor 
Y aunque me duele en el corazón
(Aunque me duela en el alma) 
Y me ahogue en un mar de temor
Tratare de vencer el temor
Solo te diré una cosa 
Te deseo el mal amor 
Solo te diré una cosa
Te deseo el mal amor
(As sido muy mala conmigo) 
El mal amor
(Te deseo lo mismo que me as hecho, lo mismo que me has causado) 
(El príncipe, esto es insomnio, Lennox) 

Navegante en este mar de dolor 
Donde no existe amor, donde reina la desilusión
Mírame estoy muy mal deseo que estés igual 
Para que así tu comprendas el daño que me as causado amor 
?
Estoy agobiado lleno de lamentos
Pasando de lo nuestro que ya esta muerto 
Y gracias a ti ya no creo en el amor 
Yo soy la victima en esta ocasión 
No recuerdo haber sido mal amor 
Esto es extraño, ya no lo aguanto 
Puedo dejarte en este mar de dolor

Un recuerdo que me llega muy dentro de mi corazón navega 
Es como si prendo el motor pero el avión 
Nunca despega
Es como si voy en un tren, sin dirección 
Y sin la vía esperando un chin de agua 
En corazones de sequía
Me conoces 
Y sabes que era loco por mirarte 
Ahora olvidarte como yo 
En pa' cal y vivir en un mundo aparte 
Donde nadie sepa las angustias que yo siento 
Te deseo lo mejor sabiendo que en verdad te miento
Ojala te pasen todas las cosas que a mi me pasaron 
Problemas, depresiones...quizás ya se te olvidaron
Donde quieras que estés quiero que entiendas 
Y sepas que ya e cerrado mi corazón 
Para que mal nunca quepa

Jamás volveré a pensarte, e decidido olvidarte ya 
Borrarte ya
Todos los sacrificios que no sabistes 
Valorizar, que mal te vaya 
Cuando no encuentres alguien 
Que te sepa amar
Hay es que me vas a recordar 
Pero lo siento porque será muy tarde ya 
Cuando no encuentres alguien 
Que te sepa amar
Hay es que me vas a recordar 
Pero lo siento porque será muy tarde ya

Ojala que te enamores de los besos 
Te enamores de las flores 
De un poeta que te vende un mundo 
De cien mil colores
Nunca selles un amor perfecto 
Vivan como reyes 
Para después yo ver como a los dos 
La nave se le estrelle 
Lo profundo, yo mientras mas te odio 
Mas me hundo 
Porque se que por tu culpa 
Yo ando solo en este mundo 
Voy perdido, me han dicho mil rumores 
Al oído, mil enfangues que tú te has tirado 
Y ahora si e sentido lo que hiciste
Yo triste me sentido, como mierda un cero a la izquierda
Y es garantizado que yo te pierda 
Pero, dicen que el amor 
No mezcla con el vino 
Mi may me dice 
José mas alante hay mas vecinos 
Vive gente 
Un amor para cada cual es diferente 
A veces nunca llega pero por lo menos 
Casi siempre cuando te enamores 
Tú debes siempre recordar
Que cada cuento tiene su principio y su final

Y a veces cuando pienso en ti, baby la cabeza me da vueltas
No quiero ni pensar, yo no se ni como actuar y si supiera
Que yo vivo pensando en ti, baby aunque a veces no lo sientas
No puedo mostrar, que vida me tienes mal

Si tu no estas, Dime porque
Como yo le hago pa' volverte a ver
Llevo tanto tiempo y siento que te vas

Si tu no estas, que puedo hacer?
Como yo le hago pa' volverte a ver
Llevo tanto tiempo y siento que te vas
Pero el sol no sale si tu no estas, no no no

Yo te he mandao' un par de fotos mías de los shows
Y un par de cartas, no se si apunte bien el zip-code
Porque yo manda que te manda y no recibo ni un recibo
No se si tu sabes que yo estoy vivo
O piensas que yo estoy muerto, me estoy volviendo loco como Berto
En el amor nunca he sido un experto
Tuve que ir al hospital, doctor receteme algo, yo estoy mal
Llevo noches y noches despierto, lo que hago es pensar bebe

Y a veces cuando pienso en ti, baby la cabeza me da vueltas
No quiero ni pensar, yo no se ni como actuar y si supiera
Que yo vivo pensando en ti, baby aunque a veces no lo sientas
No puedo mostrar, que vida me tienes mal

Esta mañana mire tu retrato
Y aunque no me creas, siento lo mismo por ti
No sabes cuanto yo te sigo amando
Extraño tus peleas, quisiera oírte reír
(Be-be baby! vamos pa'l guaya guaya)
Pero por cosas de la vida dices que ahora te perdí por siempre
Cupido se olvido de mi suerte
Y ahora mis ojos no ven si tu no estas

Dime porque, como yo le hago pa' volverte a ver
Llevo tanto tiempo y siento que te vas

Sabroso, chicloso, super poderoso
Me le pego y le roso, le roso, le roso

De camino pa' la barra
Ella me agarra
Por la parte mas oscura ella me amarra
Y empezó el duelo, dale saca las garras
Esta caliente, siente que se achicharra

Dámelo no lo dejes para mañana
Que sigan aumentando las ganas
Tu eres una veterana
Tu eres mi princesa, yo soy tu Tony Montana
Preparame el yate nos vamos este fin de semana

Con quien tengo el gusto de hablar 
Solo llamo pa' conversar un amor

Eufórico mi amor para ti fue un periódico 
Y solo llamo esta noche para decirte 

Si tu me dejas verte bebe 
Y apagarte la luz (solo quiero verte)

Que eras mi esposa y que por ti yo 
Nadaría de san juan a nueva york 
Hiciera lo peor por eso estoy

En los hombros míos pendiente a 70 lios

Encuentres sola con tu celular tu 
Me puedes llamar cualquier hora

Recuperarme fue un proceso 
De un millón de sentimientos 
En una balanza puse los buenos y malos tiempos 
Para mi sorpresa me vi sonriendo 
Pero ala misma vez sentí mis lagrimas cayendo
Entonces me di cuenta 
Que yo nunca podría odiarte 
Nos hicimos tanto daño 
Dios se fue de parte y parte 
Aun nos quedan las cenizas y memorias imborrables 
De un fuego que se apago
Así es el desamor

Son las 4 de la mañana 
Y yo despierto viendo los programas
Dos gatas durmiendo en mi cama
Es que por la fama estas mujeres se me pegan por dinero 
Primero, no le gustan los Mitsubishi
Las Hondas ni las Monteros
Palero, te viste de blanco con el sombrero
Sabiendo que Cristo viene y lo dicen to' los letreros 
Y si viene ahora mismo yo no se si me condene 
Si no he ayudado a los niños que salen en CNN
Yo señora, yo quiero comprarle un collar de perla 
Y un ramo de rosas no hay tiempo ni para olerlas
Así que móntese en el tren de mi vida sin equipaje
El blanca nieve la película y to' los prietaje
Cuando yo sea grande yo quiero ser como Cosculluela 
Tener muchas amigas y no tener que ir a la escuela
Socio mides tus palabras cuando estés arrodillado
Que no hay vuelta pa' atrás después que suene el trompetazo

Así es la vida que vivo 
No la puedo cambiar 
Ya escogí mi destino y decidí brillar
Tome decisiones y en ocaciones
Tuve que reír pa' no llorar
Pero cada cuento tiene su final
(Tiene su final)

Una autógrafo en los cartones
Y piensa en mi Papa y sus decisiones
Fanática me llena de carta to' los buzones
Dice, ""Coscu esta noche me voy a poner las extensiones
Y voy a pintarme el pelo como dicen tus canciones""
Yo soy tu rubia y tu mi blanco, perla de ojos claros
Y ando con tus temas de los conflictos y los disparos 
Me quitaron tus CD's porque dicen que no es buen ejemplo 
Y papi y mami quieren que me acerque mas al Templo
Me dice lea los proverbios
No se como Coscu puede causarte tanto nervio
Si es un humano de carne y hueso como nosotros
Y no se fía que va caminando en puente roto
Sin agarre, una escoba sin el palo nunca barre
Un cuento no es un cuento si no tiene quien lo narra
Va a la deriva solamente una vida
Y no se si me vale por la próxima salvación

Así es la vida que vivo 
No la puedo cambiar

Que no le des la mano 2 veces 
Al que te la muerda"" 

Por eso yo rezo, vivo y sigo positivo

Andan llorando pa que los saquen

Y no ronques de calle 
A quien carajo tu le has dao pa bajo

Después que sales tu

Que no te lo chupa

Que me pidió 10 pesos 
Que bueno que no te mande un carajo 
Te has olvidao hasta los presos

Que bajo cabrón estoy aquí de pie y con vida 
Soporten a coscu mientras a coscu 
Mientras yo viva 
Que mucha mierda hablastes to esos años 
Que respeten tu silla 
Pues quédate parao cabrón 
Porque la silla que hay es mía

Y antes que me caiga yo 
Se cae la capa e ozono

Las esquinas son paralelas

¡COSCULLUELA! 

Yo no soy de la calle yo soy de mi casa 
Cabrón de que te disfrazaste 
El día que fuiste a plaza 
El chaqueton viejo 
Con Neidy y fuiste a ligar la baby 
Los zapatos de san givy 
Tos manchaos con greivis 

Hasta un puerco mexicano 
Te saco a ti del boquete 
Montastes tu película 
Y las ristras de paquete 
Tos de arena 
Sabiendo lo del cancer y de la nena 
Y antes de pautar lojar 
Dices algo de tus cadenas 
Que si medio millón 
Que si he pegao en san juan 
Las retro te llegan al muelle 
Directo de taiwan 
Bájate del crucero 
Pa hablarte claro 
Aunque no quiero 
Hasta pal tiempo de Big Boy 
Llego los ritmos ya es playeros 

No me llames para hacer las pases 
Pase lo que pase delen la cámara de gases 
No le quiten los disfraces que el tipo esta tribulao 
Se le biro al difunto junto 
Con richi in the house 

Estas desorientao 
Tu venta de discos nunca existían 
Los chavos del buda 
Fue por JAIME que los ponía 
Y no le mientas a tu gente 
Que pagastes 120 
Por la prenda de V 
Si esa V es de Vicente 
Se lo mamas a yankee 
Porque el cabrón te visitó 
Yo te hubiera visitao 
Pero a mi nadie me invito 
Y después me llamas 
Sin haberme conocido en el momento 
Y me dices que te mande 10mil pesos 
Porque eres TEMPO? 

No te creo 
Ya santa esta montao en el trineo 
Camino pa palma 
Solo pa darme este trofeo 
Por haber sido el que entierra 
Al capitán de los fatulos 
Y voy directo pa tu estudio

Volver a vivir en la luna

Y darnos el amor que no nos dimos

Converso con dios y le escribo versos
A ver si me responde
Me diga la hora  del lugar y donde
Pa’ llegarle volando donde tú te escondes
Que yo sé que muchas veces
Siente que se vira el mundo
En el amor todo te sale al revés

Yo sigo aquí esperando y muero por solo un segundo
De poder tener tu cuerpo otra vez y

Tan solo verte

Sentir como se paraliza el mundo
Cuando tú me tienes cerca de ti
Yo te tengo cerca de mi cuerpo
Siento que los problemas están resueltos me conoces
Hace tanto tiempo y hace tanto siento
Que pa’ seguir solo prefiero estar bajo del cemento
Que descanse en paz mi alma con todos mis sentimientos
Desde las nubes voy a chequearte en todos tus movimientos

Yo tu ángel guardián
Y tú la reina de mis días
La dueña de mis noches largas en mi fantasía
Mientras canto voy a seguir alucinando con tenerte
Esperando que un día tenga la suerte

Tenemos una noche loca lala la la, y rico la pasamos
Tú me dices si te busco, o si nos escapamos

Tú me dices si yo paso y te recojo en el rojo
Pide lo que quieras cumpliré tu antojo
Yo sé que tú tienes novio mami no me enojo
Pero Coscu con él ni me mojo
A ella le gusta escaparse conmigo
Llevarse un abrigo
Y un burtito yo no lo investigo
Ni tampoco le pregunto to' los machos
Que ella tiene en Instagram
Si cuando llega Coscu todos se le van
Se espantan, pongo mis temas y le encantan
A todo volumen hasta que los vecinos se levantan
Ve como mis prendas resaltan
Y me dice mi blanquito sigue dándole ra ta tan tan
To'a la noche hasta por el día en una estadía
Envueltos en las cenizas de un fuego que antes había
Sin secretos, te tiro una foto y no te etiqueto

Yo sé que tu novio no te escucha
Ni tampoco te dedica las canciones
Fabrica sus emociones
Salpicas por que peleas con cojones
Al tipo no hay quien lo soporte, y tu con ese corte
Las mujeres te ven y desde el sur al norte
Se tachan, nos tratan de romper y se escrachan
Ma' yo soy tu Khan Jey, tu mi Kim kardashian
Otro amor otro cuento el futuro está escrito
Mami no me compares porque yo no compito
Esos zapatos, carteras, pulseras
Conmigo eh ascensor y con el novio tuyo las escaleras
Demasiao' adelantao' a tiempo yo siento
Que llegastes a brillarme mi mejor momento
Soltero, y al lado tuyo más próspero
Buscando en tu corazón poder ser el primero

Rondando por mi mente todo el día
(Crazy crazy love) 
Siempre juegas con mi psicología 
Y yo no puedo olvidarte pero

A donde voy

La miro directo a los ojos 
Me descontrolo y yo no sé qué hacer

A donde voy
Siempre me la encuentro 
Esa nena me dejó loco 
La miro directo a los ojos 
Me descontrolo y yo no sé qué hacer 
Baby girl 

El que sabe, sabe 
Ese booty en el mahon no cabe 
Cada vez que me la encuentro termino grave 
Es imposible hablar con ella sin que me trabe 
Dice que soy el que tiene la llave 

Su mirada impacta, medidas exactas 
De los pies a la cabeza, la muñeca sigue intacta 
De atracción fatal, es algo literal 
El que la mira sufre, y goza el que puede tocar 
De solo mirarnos, ambos proyectamos algo 
Que lo comenzamos va ser para largo 
Ya en serio, haciéndolo todo a criterio 
Este juego nos va a llevar el cementerio 

Falta con mirarnos para desearnos 
Y convertir en fuego toda esta pasión 
Sin lugar a dudas entre los dos creamos 
Ese laberinto que nos encerró 

Pasó el tiempo y decidimos olvidarlo 
Pero esa no fue la mejor decisión 
Ahora no sé cómo borrar el pasado, porque

A donde voy
Siempre me la encuentro 
Esa nena me dejó loco 
La miro directo a los ojos 
Me descontrolo y yo no sé qué hacer 
Baby girl 

A donde voy
Siempre me la encuentro 
Esa nena me dejó loco 
La miro directo a los ojos 
Me descontrolo y yo no sé qué hacer 
Baby girl 

Increíble postura 
Su cuerpo es como una escultura 
Y el pelo lacio exactamente en la cintura 
Sin novio, la quieren y le tienen odio 
Porque llega y se le pegan como el microbio 

En persona, el que la toca, se obsesiona 
En la cama, un movimiento que impresiona 
Reacciona, ella sigue de blanco perla 
Tírenle con todo que nadie puede convencerla 

Yo intento olvidarla y más me la encuentro 
Busco enfocarme en otra cosa y no me concentro 
En este laberinto ambos estamos en el centro 
Yo busco salir pero por donde sales yo entro 

Yo ni me rindo porque esto ya se fue por la window 
Pero despertar a tu lado suena lindo 
Quisiera revivirte los deseos para mandártelos de nuevo 
Sin brincar ningún detalle 

Qué puedo decir sin que te suene en broma 
Tengo ganas de ti y no dejas que te coma 
Tu sonrisa delata que estas juguetona 
Te empezas a convertir de gatita a leona 

Mami tírele bye bye 
Mami tírele bye bye 
No subestimes el destino si no sabes lo que trae 
Mami tírele bye bye 
Mami tírele bye bye 
Si nos decimos adiós mañana tú vuelves y caes 

A donde voy
Siempre me la encuentro 
Esa nena me dejó loco 
La miro directo a los ojos 
Me descontrolo y yo no sé qué hacer

A donde voy
Siempre me la encuentro

Que no era solamente yo 
Que tú sin mí puedes ser tú 
Pero sin ti yo no soy yo 
No sé qué me pasó 
Siento que me pierdo 
Siguen pasando los días 
Y más yo te recuerdo

Tú serás para siempre 
Lo más que quiero yo 
Yo seré para ti 
Un triste recuerdo 

Tú serás para siempre 
Lo más que quiero yo 
Yo seré para ti 
Un triste recuerdo 

Si esta almohada hablara el mundo se enteraría de mis secretos 
Como que tengo de todo pero sin ti sigo incompleto 
Que triste ironía recordar que un día fuiste mía 
Pero tengo que aceptarlo aunque mi alma esté vacía 
Lloro como un niño cada vez que miro el portafolio 
Yo sin ti por esta vida es como el mundo sin petróleo 
Tengo el control del juego y de todo su monopolio 
Pero mi corazón se sigue acercando a su velorio 
Aun hay vida porque nunca se da una despedida 
Sin que dios decida una chance a una mujer arrepentida 
Un hombre que se arrepiente nadando sin corriente 
En un océano donde no se oculta lo que se siente, baby

En tu soledad 
Yo sé que no dejas de pensar al igual que yo 
Cuando hacíamos el amor 
Y ya todo has borrado 

En tu soledad 
Yo sé que no dejas de pensar al igual que yo 
Cuando hacíamos el amor 
Y ya todo has borrado 

Y ya quisiera que algún día cayeras en tiempo
Que no solo vivas el momento 
Que te detengas y pienses 
Que todo pasa como el viento 
Mientras se sufre es lento 
Quisiera que recapacites baby 
Y que juntos terminemos el cuento 
Que no lo facilites baby 
Deja mostrarte lo mas profundo de mis sentimientos 
Mientras paseamos, de amor hablamos 
Y si lo perdimos, lo recuperamos 
Luego nos besamos y recapacitamos 
Actuemos, que el amor revive si luchamos

Tú serás para siempre 
Lo más que quiero yo 
Yo seré para ti 
Un triste recuerdo

Tú serás para siempre 
Lo más que quiero yo 
Yo seré para ti 
Un triste recuerdo

Querida luna que me escuchas Y alumbras todas mis noches 
Dile que me perdone y el pasado no me reproche 
Que somos humanos y nos equivocamos por error 
Y lo importante es arreglarlo y hacerlo mejor 
Dile, la casa sigue igual, sus cosas son intocables 
En cada esquina de este hogar hay un momento inolvidable 
Una lagrima se derrama, un corazón que la llama 
Y antes de yo acostar a la otra prefiero botar la cama 
Me hago daño pero es que la extraño 
De nada me valen los consejos ni los regaños 
Pueden pasar mil años, pa' el amor no hay límites ni tamaños 
Yo te seguiré dedicando conciertos en el baño

En tu soledad 
Yo sé que no dejas de pensar al igual que yo 
Cuando hacíamos el amor 
Y ya todo has borrado 

En tu soledad 
Yo sé que no dejas de pensar al igual que yo 
Cuando hacíamos el amor 
Y ya todo has borrado

Tú serás para siempre 
Lo más que quiero yo 
Yo seré para ti 
Un triste recuerdo

Tú serás para siempre 
Lo más que quiero yo 
Yo seré para ti

Ya ni recuerdo quien tocó primero, si la fama o el dinero
Yo intenté por tantos años y sembré mi turno como hombre
Y aunque no me acuerde cuándo y dónde
Fue que el mundo se aprendió mi nombre y es que

Entre lujos y dinero me arropaba el frío
Entre cámaras y fama me sentía vacío
Y cuando todo mi mundo se ahogaba en lo hondo
Llegaste tú, justo antes de que yo tocara fondo
Entre lujos y dinero me arropaba el frío
Entre cámaras y fama me sentía vacío
Y cuando todo mi mundo se ahogaba en lo hondo
Llegaste tú justo antes de que yo tocara fondo, ooh
Tocara fondo, ooh

Siempre hay un amor, que sin ser el primero
Te hace olvidar todo lo que no es
Ese es el amor verdadero

Esta es una historia sin final, un cuento sin terminar
Y al caminar, al fin entiendo con quien debo estar
Siempre solía aparentar entre mis lujos y la fama
Pero la soledad, me acompañaba aquí en mi cama
Eres mi guía, desde que llegaste todos mis días, se arreglaron
Ya mis noches no son frías, eres todo lo que quería 
conversando con mil estrellas fugaces
Sin conocerte pero deseando que llegases
En mi armario, tengo guardados cartas e itinerarios
¿Quién dijo que un hombre no tiene diario?
Para escribir lo necesario, ¿cómo?, ¿cuándo? y ¿dónde?, fecha y horario
Aparecías en mis pensamientos involuntarios
Si me pides una estrella yo muevo el cielo y la tierra
Cuido el suelo donde pisas y voy removiendo piedras
Porque solo te mereces lo mejor
Entraste en vida en tiempo de blanco y negro a darle color

Entre lujos y dinero me arropaba el frío
Entre cámaras y fama me sentía vacío
Y cuando todo mi mundo se ahogaba en lo hondo
Llegaste tú, justo antes de que yo tocara fondo
Entre lujos y dinero me arropaba el frío
Entre cámaras y fama me sentía vacío
Y cuando todo mi mundo se ahogaba en lo hondo
Llegaste tú justo antes de que yo tocara fondo, ooh
tocara fondo ooh, yeah

(Y si me hubiera muerto sin haberte conocido
Me atrevería decir que morir
Sin nunca haber vivido)

Mi polli te confieso, mientras estoy parado en este altar 
Esperando que tú llegues, no paro de suspirar
Y de pensar en que te adoro, eres mi gran tesoro
Y de que no te cambiaría, por la fama ni el oro
No me gustan los tatuajes, pero me marqué tu nombre
Soy capaz de muchas cosas, mai bebé yo soy tu hombre
Es que tú me complementas, si no sabes te las inventas
Eres la calma, en medio de toda mis tormentas
No me olvido, cuando te vi por primera vez
Es la mujer que rondabas mi sueño desde la niñez
Casi te pierdo, pero nunca perdí la fe
Me lo propuse, trabajé duro y te conquisté
Ahora o nunca, por ti nadaría los sietes mares
Prometo estar contigo hasta que la muerte nos separe
Es mi deber, cuidar y proteger esa mujer
Que dios puso en camino y es un nuevo amanecer

Entre lujos y dinero me arropaba el frío
Entre cámaras y fama me sentía vacío
Y cuando todo mi mundo se ahogaba en lo hondo
Llegaste tú, justo antes de que yo tocara fondo
Entre lujos y dinero me arropaba el frío
Entre cámaras y fama me sentía vacío
Y cuando todo mi mundo se ahogaba en lo hondo
Llegaste tú justo antes de que yo tocara fondo, ooh
tocara fondo, ooh

Y si me atreviera decir todo lo que siento
Me quedaría corto
No existen las palabras
Para expresar este sentimiento

Eres como un vicio que hacia ti me jala
Y me toma una bellaquera a gran escala
Unas ganas de verte toa la noche en mi Impala

De una me sedujo, de esos ojos brujos
Me mira de una forma que me transforma
Te echo el esperma entre las piernas

Yo creo que me echaste un fufu 
Pero con magia blanca 
Pero lo que me molesta 
Es al revés lo que me encanta 
Una poción a base de culebras y de salamandras
Que no se te olviden los ratones más las ranas marcas
Me metiste adentro una burbuja y yo traté de reventarla con agujas
Me apareció una linda bruja
Cambiaste de repente mi manera de pensar
Antes en mi vocabulario no existía la palabra mal 
A ver yo creo que te amo como del infinito al mal 
Y ahora me sabe a azúcar to’ lo que antes me sabía a sal 
Y dice Ñejo que culo 
Tiene peso en una relación

Cuando estoy desanimao’ me dice no te me rinda
Eres mi hombre, un guerrero, mi number one 
Baby yo no me enamoré de un Don Juan 
Así que frente en alto, saco pecho que casi parto 
Si me deja me da un infarto 
Día a día me levanto y sigo queriendo, la canto

Cuando te vi tan cerca que no pude resistir
Tan suave que empec a morir por ti

Por donde anda la ciudad

Por el humo de un camión

Sabe dar malos consejos
Y dice dice siempre lo que hace
Es arma de doble filo

Para que vos me sorprendas con una nueva versión
De tu agonía y cada palabra que digas
Rebota entre el techo y el suelo
Semillas de pesadillas de un plan que pintaba perfecto

Fue de cristal tu mirada y tu pelo un río de plata
Se me enfriaron las manos
Y un nudo de rabia creció en mi garganta
Como si hubieras salido del mismo fondo de la tierra
Para quebrar mis raíces patearlas y hacerme la guerra

A dónde fue tu gloria
A dónde se perdió
Dónde quedo la historia
Que prometió tu voz
A dónde me arrastraste
Qué virus te ataco
Para que tu veneno
Hoy me lo beba yo

One more down by the brook of Babylon
One more down in accordance with my fate
One long drift across the lake of Avalon
One more trip that I must create

A blood red line
Through the sonisphere
I can't resolve where it's coming from
I sense it's the great pandemonium

Just one, just one more day
One more day by the pits of hell
Just one more when even yesterday was too late
One more thought that I have to sow
One last trick that you can't debate

Of summer boy she's got at home
She loves her telescope

Out in space for you?

Count Basie,"You leave me alone, you don't even phone
You're carefree as a bird in the sky
But what goes up must come down
And, Baby, you've been flying too high

It's all over town, you're chasing around
But I'm not gonna sit home and cry
Remember what goes up must come down
And, Baby, you've been flying too high

You ought to get your walkin' papers
But now it's too late
Because I know you too well
When you're through cuttin' capers
You break down my gate
To ring my front door bell

So go have your fling, and don't miss a thing
I'll see you down to earth by and by
Remember what goes up must come down
And, Baby, you've been flying too high",What Goes up Must Come Down
Count Basie,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day Ive known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn`t past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Count Basie,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura
Count Basie,"Strangers in the night, 
Exchanging glances
Wandering the night, 
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night 
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night

When they see you out with me
Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

When you're passin' by, flowers droop and sigh
And I know the reason why
Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Don't buy sugar
You just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar
It's sweeter when you stir it up

When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips
Seems the honey fairly drips

Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

And it ain't that sweet workin' six nights a week and your swimsuit gets ripped

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way

Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn dear

Count Basie,"Now this could only happen to a guy like me
And only happen in a town like this
So may I say to each of you most gratefully
As I throw each one of you a kiss

This is my kind of town, Chicago is
My kind of town, Chicago is
My kind of people too
People who smile at you

And each time I roam, Chicago is
Calling me home, Chicago is
Why I just grin like a clown
It's my kind of town

My kind of town, Chicago is
My kind of town, Chicago is
My kind of razzmatazz
And it has, all that jazz

And each time I leave, Chicago is

Count Basie,"Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money, I didn't care
I carried my friends out for a good time
Buying bootleg liquor, champagne and wine

Then I began to fall so low
I didn't have a friend, and no place to go
So if I ever get my hand on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till them eagle's green

Nobody knows you when you down and out
In my pocket not one penny
And my friends I haven't any
But If I ever get on my feet again
Then I'll meet my long lost friend
It's mighty strange, without a doubt
Nobody knows you when you down and out
I mean when you down and out

Mmmmmmmm, when you're down and out
Mmmmmmmm, not one penny

Count Basie,"I can only give you love that lasts forever,
And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,

Count Basie,"Sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears
And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find

Count Basie,"I could have told you she would hurt you,
She'd love you awhile and desert you,
If only you'd asked I could have told you so!
I could have saved you some crying,
Yes, I could have told you she was lying,
But you were in love and you didn't want to know.

I hear her now as I toss and turn and try to sleep,
I hear her now making promises she'll never keep;
And now it's over and done with,
She'll find someone new to have fun with!
Through all of my tears I could have told you so.

That we played the game from the start
It's easy to lie to strangers
But what will I tell my heart?

When I smile to hide all the tears inside
What an ache it will be bring
Then I'll wander home to a telephone
That forgot how to ring, ring, ring

Count Basie,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone

So I lit a fire

Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Count Basie,"Little Lilly was oh! So silly and shy

Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things

And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid of the plans that we made

Smack dab in the middle right now
So Ray can rock and roll to satisfy his soul

Oodles of butter and somethin sweet
Gallons of coffee to wash it down
Bicarbonated soda by the pound

Count Basie,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Count Basie,"Look at me, I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree;
And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud,
I can' t understand
I get misty, just holding your hand.

Walk my way,
And a thousand violins begin to play,
Or it might be the sound of your hello,
That music I hear,
I get misty, the moment you're near.

Can't you see that you're leading me on?
And it's just what I want you to do,
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you.

On my own,
When I wander through this wonderland alone,
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love.

Too misty,
And too much
In love",Misty

Count Basie,"I dig Rock and Roll music and I love to get the chance to play.

I figure it's about the happiest sound goin' down today.

I dig the Mamas and the Papas at ""The Trip,"" Sunset Strip in L.A.
And they got a good thing goin' when the words don't get in the way.
And when they're really wailing, Michelle and Cass are sailin'.
Hey! they really nail me to the wall.

I dig Donovan in a dream-like, tripped out way
His crystal images tell you 'bout a brighter day
And when the Beatles tell you
They've got a word ""love"" to sell you
They mean exactly what they say

I dig Rock and Roll music I could really get it on in that scene.

Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Count Basie,"Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing (swinging) cheek to cheek
Oh I love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill (boot) me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
(Come on and) Dance with me
I want my arm(s) about you
That (Those) charm(s) about you
Will carry me through...

Count Basie,"Some other Spring
I'll try to love
Now I still cling
To faded blossoms
Fresh from worn
Left crushed and torn
Like the love affair I mourn

Some other spring
When twilight falls
Will the night bring
Another to me?

Not your kind
But let me find
It's not true that love is blind
Sunshine's around me 
But deep in my heart it's cold as ice
Love, once you've found me
But can that story unfold twice?

Some other spring
Will my heart awake
Stirring to sing
Love's magic music
Then forget the old duet
Love in some other spring

Lifted up my heart and made me count the cost
To find I'd gained, not lost!

You showed me I was wrong
And you taught me how to carry on

Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he, for me.

Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong, the man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile; I'll understand
And in a little while he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home just meant for two
From which I'll never roam; who would? Would you?

Count Basie,"Everybody's laughing
Yes everybody's laughing
They know that you and I are through
And everybody's laughing

I told the world you loved me
And bragged about it proudly
But since they know it's over
They're laughing at me loudly.

People love to linger
So they can point a finger
And tear apart a gal whose heart
Was taken through the wringer

It we could start all over
The laugh might be on them
But meanwhile
Everybody's laughing

It we could start all over
The laugh might be on them
But meanwhile
Everybody's laughing",Everybody's Laughing

Until I have learned
My heart has been burned

They say I shouldn't dream
Of your face in the moon

Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live.

Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark

With a wishing well
I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people, who
wants people?

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",Small Hotel

Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me",Lover Come Back to Me
Count Basie,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
Count Basie,"He's got that funny name
An' ramblin' that's his game, that's it
He's Rambo, talkin' bout 
Me!
We'll see (Piano)
They call him Rambo 'cause he's travellin'
He don't stay one place
His life's a string he keeps unravellin'
He don't leave no trace
He's got a yen for changin' places
He digs changin' scenes
That way he stays in everybody's good graces

He's happy on the move
He's mobile and free
He wants no strings attached
That's how it's gotta be, see!
He'll keep on ramblin' till the coda
He don't stay one place
Because he's just a ramblin' man
His favorite hobby's hittin' the road
He was a fella livin' solely by the ramblers only code
Some people're born to roam
Fate gave 'em roamin' natures

An' so they wander aroun'
Leavin' people wondrin' when they'll touch the groun'
Hither 'n yon, here 'n beyon'
Wherever they never been before
As soon as you're used t'their face

They're off 'n runnin' again
Gone to another new place
Peripatetic is the only word 
that I have ever heard that people could use
that really describes him
There's no other word could do that
Only other word I know that comes 
The closest to it is ""Gypsy""
An' that don't really fit him at all
""Cause he ain't tellin' fortunes
'N hates bein' dipsy
Everywhere I go they call him Rambo
'Cause he won't stay long

In my ramblin'
I've met a lotta people here 'n there
An' I find they're 'bout the same everywhere
Each with his own little thing
That he uses while he's tryin' to swing
Maybe the look ain't the same
But they play the same game
An' there's quite a bit o' difference
In their outlook, I know
Still 'n yet, their story, lem'me tell you
Is a story that you won't forget
When I was young 'n very green
I felt so stuck with m'present situation
Later, when I got a little older
that was when I discovered I could split
'N find myself another groove
That was all I need
I was on the move
I packed my little sack 'n started ramblin'
To this day I'm a rover who'll always be ramblin'

You git drug stayin' in one place
Depressed an' feelin' low down
Get new kicks movin' roun'

Roamin' the country's educational for you
'N widens your point of view
Tests why' mettle 'n cools why' mind out
'N that's true without a doubt
why know? I mean why'dig - -
That's Rambo's gig
Rambo is ready to ramble 'n itchin' t'split
Oh yeah, he'll start packin' 'n quit it
Forget it! 'Cause he's done with it

That's Rambo! Travellin' light
Stay too long he'll git uptight
So his motto is ""Keep movin'""
You got it! That's his bit!
Nex' time he might leave an address
'Cause the little girl that he met
Las' night
Paid him so much attention
That it got him a bit uptight
We might not have t'call him Rambo
'Cause he jes' might be settlin' down
He's gone the way of all men
Fat, skinny or tall men
It happened to this Rover we know - Rambo",Rambo
Count Basie,"I'm confessin' that I love you,
Tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confessin' that I need you,
Honest I do, need you every moment.
In your eyes I read such strange things,
But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,
Saying ""can't we still be friends""
If you go, you know you'll grieve me,
All in life on you depends.
Am I guessin' that you love me,
Dreaming dreams of you in vain,
I'm confessin' that I love you, over again.",I'm Confessin [*]
Count Basie,"Take a look in the mirror, look at yourself
But don't you look too close,
'Cause you just might see the person

That you hate the most, Lord
What's happening to this human race
I can't even see one friendly face
Brothers fight brothers and sisters wink their eyes

While silver tongues bear fruits of poison lies
Take a look at your children
Born innocent, every boy and every girl
Denying themselves a real chance

To build a better world
Oh, dear lord what's happening
To your precious dream

I think its washing away
On a bloody, bloody stream
Yes, take a look at your children

Before it's too late and tell them nobody
Nobody wins when the prize is hate

Oh, no, no, no it's not too late
We gotta tell all of our children
That love, love, love is the way, yeah, yeah","It's Sand, Man!"
Count Basie,"I may be wrong but I won't be wrong always,
I may be wrong but I won't be wrong always,
You gonna long for me baby one of these old rainy days!

That's alright baby, baby that's alright for you,
That's alright baby, baby that's alright for you,
Now it's obvious to you baby, that's the way you do!

She got ways like a devil, she shaped like a frog,
Starts a-lovin' me, I holler ""Ooh, hot dog!"",

Count Basie,"Blow, ill wind, blow away; find my love today
You're blowin' me no good, no good
Go, ill wind, go away; skies are oh-so gray
Around my neighborhood and that's no good

You're only misleadin' the sunshine I'm needin'
Ain't that a shame
It's so hard to keep up with troubles that creep up
From out of nowhere when love's to blame

So, ill wind, blow away; find my love today
You're blowin' me no good, no good, no good",Ill Wind
Count Basie,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know",More Than You Know
Count Basie,"You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap!

Those eyes, those sighs, 
They're part of the tender trap

You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart, until your heart just goes wap!

Those trees, that breeze, 
They're part of the tender trap

Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map

You wonder how
But it's too late now 
You fell in love, and love is the tender trap
And I'm trapped with you",(Love Is) The Tender Trap
Count Basie,"Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like on
A-Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me

Fill my heart with song and let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you

Fill my heart with song
Let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for, all I worship and adore
In other words, please be true

In other words
I love you",Fly Me to the Moon
Count Basie,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
And dear, I wonder if you find love
An optical illusion, too? 

Are the stars out tonight? 
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
Cause I only have eyes for you, dear
The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
Cause I only have eyes for you.

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You

Won't help you forget her

You're only burnin' 
A torch you can't lose
