Mike Harrison,"I don't have to beg you to hold me
Cause somebody else will
You don't have to love me when I want it, no
Cause somebody else will

Your so called friends say you don't need it
When all the time they're trying to get it
Look out
Your good thing is about to come to an end
Your real good thing is about to come to an end

All those nites I watched the four walls
I did not have to watch them all alone
When other men said they wanted me (whenever someone said)
I didn't have to tell them I was your very own (think that I was)

You have all the love that I've got baby
Even ice melts to water and gets hot
Look out
Your good

Gettin' myself back together
Is going to be a big problem I know
But when the right man says he wants me
You can bet I won't tell him no

Cause your real good",Your Good Thing Is About To End
Mike Harrison,"Oh what a price I had to pay
For loving you, you, you

I bought a house, a diamond ring
I had to give up everything
Oh what a price I had to pay
For loving you, you, you

I  stopped my rambling, I even stopped gambling
And I stopped staying out all night
Oh what a price I had to pay
For loving you, you, you

I tried so hard to do what's right
But you only wrecked my life
Oh what a price I had to pay
For loving you, you, you

You've heard my story. I've sung my song
So, goodbye baby, I'm gone
Oh what a price I had to pay
For loving you, you, you
",What a Price
Mike Hatchard,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul",Body and Soul
Mike Hatchard,"Gee, but it's tough to be broke, kid.
It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.
My luck is changing, it's gotten from 
simply rotten to something worse
Who knows, some day I will win too. 
I'll begin to reach my prime.

Now though I see what our end is,
All I can spend is just my time.

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Dream awhile, scheme awhile
We're sure to find

Happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for.

Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.

Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby.
I can't give you anything but love.

Rome wasn't built in a day, kid.
You have to pay, kid, for what you get.
But I am willing to wait, dear, 
Your little mate, dear, will not forget.

You have a lifetime before you.
I'll adore you, come what may.

Please don't be blue for the present, 
When it's so pleasant to hear you say

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Dream awhile, scheme awhile

Mike Hatchard,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
Lover, one lovely day

Mike Henderson,"If the jukebox took teardrops
And the whiskey was free
If that old car in the parking lot
Drove home automatically
If every curl on a honky tonk girl
Didn't start those memories
Wouldn't it be a wonderful world
For somebody just like me

How long can a man keep goin'
Like every day's his last
I've paid off the rent and the government
Maybe I could pay off the past

If the jukebox took teardrops
And the whiskey was free
If that old car in the parking lot
Drove home automatically
If every curl on a honky tonk girl
Didn't start those memories
Wouldn't it be a wonderful world
For somebody just like me

Wouldn't I be on easy street
Livin' this life of mine
I could keep right on till the hurt's all gone
And it wouldn't cost me a dime

If the jukebox took teardrops
And the whiskey was free
If that old car in the parking lot
Drove home automatically
If every curl on a honky tonk girl
Didn't start those memories
Wouldn't it be a wonderful world
For somebody just like me

Mike Henderson,"I was born the restless kind
Settlin' down never crossed my mind
Wild and woolly, well I guess that's me
People sure get nervous when a woman's free
I can hold my tongue, I can hold my wine
I can hold my own, I'm the restless kind

Well I've seen the country and I've been to town
Rode in limousines with the tops rolled down
Walked down the road where the rivers freeze
Whatever it takes I do what I please
I can hold my horses, I can hold the line
I can hold my own, I'm the restless kind

I was born the restless kind
And I never assume what I'm gonna find
I can stand my ground, I can slip through a crack
Just as sure as I leave, honey I'll be back
I can hold my temper, I can bide my time
I can hold my own, I'm the restless kind

I can hold my temper, I can bide my time
I can hold my own, I'm the restless kind
",The Restless Kind
Mike Holober,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Mike Holober,"Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Black bird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly

You were only waiting for this moment to arise,
You were only waiting for this moment to arise",Blackbird
Mike Ireland,"If your sweetheart sends a letter of goodbye
It's no secret you'll feel better if you cry
When waking from a bad dream
Don't you sometimes think it's real
But it's only false emotions that you feel

If your heartaches seem to hang around too long
And your blues keep getting bluer with each song
Remember sunshine can be found behind the cloudy skies
So let your hair down and go on and cry

If your heartaches seem to hang around too long
And your blues keep getting bluer with each song
Well now, remember sunshine can be found
Behind a cloudy sky
So let your hair down and go right on and cry",Cry

What would you do, to get to me?
What would you say, to have your way?
Would you give it up or try again?
If I hesitate to let you in?
Now would you be yourself, or play a role?

If I say no, would you turn away,
Or play me off or would you stay?

I'm into you, you into me? But I can't let it go, so easily.
Not 'till I see, where this could be, could be eternally, or just week.
You know our chemistry, it's off the chain.
It's perfect now, but will it change?
This ain't a yes, this ain't a no.
Just do your thang, and we'll see how it goes.

Mike James Kirkland,"Stayed in bed all mornin' just to pass the time.
There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'.
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
It used to be so easy, livin' here with you.
You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
There'll be good times again for me and you,
But we just can't stay together; don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it. (we can't make it)
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby I need your lovin'

Will I ever be the same?
Oh yeah!  When you see me smiling
You know things have gotten worse
Any smile you might see has all been rehearsed

This emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness inside, darling
Makes me feel half alive

Mike Jimenez,"Do you remember the 21st night of September?
Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing.
As we danced in the night,
Remember how the stars stole the night away

Ba de ya, say do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love,
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

Now December found the love that we shared in September.
Only blue talk and love,
Remember the true love we share today

Ba de ya, say do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day

When I step in a room you see ice
I'm on my grind puttin' it down
So I can live my life right

Fin to put it all in why'all face

I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

All why'all haters, can kiss our ass
We got too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

You balling
If you got Sprewell rims, and they crawling
If you got four five, Clarions balling
You hit the club on dubs, and your name
They be calling, calling, calling, calling
You balling
If you push a candy color, with butter on cutters
You got a flock of girls, and they all know each other
With the command of your voice, they all
Become lovers, lovers, lovers, lovers

I can catch boppers like Paul Wall, with the wood out my grill
I can do a girl wrong, and she goin' be by me still
I can get caught cheating on my feet, maybe she will
Never leave, cause I be spitting my game so real
I'm Mike Jones (who), Mike Jones Jones
That's been a baller, before I even grabbed a microphone
Swishahouse, Swishablast no more minimum wage
Independently paid, living lovely and laid
I never ever cheap talk, cause I got a platinum grill
I changed the game over, with Sprewells on my fifth wheel
My album Who Is Mike Jones, coming soon
My album Who Is Mike Jones, coming soon
Already, I pull up on Perellis with wood leather and grape jelly
T.V.'s falling down, watching DMX in Belly
Swishahouse Swishablast, we come first not last
Police pull me over, so they could play my Dreamcast
And my Xbox, I got stubborn rims
They keep going, even when I say stop (man)
Mike Jones in your ear, they gave me MVP
And this is just rookie year (Mike Jones)
Is a baller baby, shot caller baby
In the Lex having sex, twenties crawling baby
I stay balling, T.V.'s stay falling, 23's stay crawling
I'm the definition of balling playboy (man)

My rims spinning, I swear I got me Sprewell shoes
I hop out, wearing And 1 Sprewell shoes
I'm moving slow like freewells move, I chop the block so hard
Them niggas bopping, like them females do
It's Magnificent, I'm acting bad with Slim and Mike
I'm that boy that you see, rolling them rims you like
I'm pimping dykes, either wearing Tim's or Nike's
Haters see I'm trying to shine, they want to dim my light
But can't do it, cause I shine too bright
(say man what kind of rims you got), whatever kind you like
And best believe, that twelve be in the trunk
Yo and if I'm in the Benz, it's a 12 with a V in the front
Wood grain, leather black seats
Magno with no cash flow, is like Luke without his gaped teeth
So forget, what my Porsche cost
Just realize I got enough do', to pay for R. Kelly's court costs

[Chorus]

[Slim Thug]
I played a lot of blocks, so my cash stack fast
I got a lot of rocks, and I ain't talking bout crack
Slim Thug's a high roller, and I ain't talking bout dice
See I got a lot of cars, and they ain't nothing nice
When it come to balling, I'm a vet in this shit
Every time I get a car, I'm wetting the bitch
Street rich young stunner, I don't play no games
I switch cars three times, and stay on swings
I'm respected, got the cost of a house on my necklace
That boy reckless, straight out of Texas
I ain't goin' talk about my Sprewells, why yall know I got em
I ain't goin' talk about my diamonds, cause I know why yall spot em
Why yall want to know what I claim, bitch read my piece
You want to know if we ball, bitch read my teeth
Ha, I'm Slim Thugger, that name ring bells
Everything Slim touch, guaranteed to sell, bitch I'm

Yeah! Mike Jones! Who?  Mike Jones!
Where will I be at, five years from now
Five years from now
Five years from now

[Chorus: Lil' Bran]
Where would I go, who would I see in, five years from now
Tell me how will I live, will I raise some kids yeah, five years from now
Will I be locked down or will I be underground yeah, five years from now
Tell me what my future hold, it scares me not to know
what I'ma be doin', five years from now

[Mike Jones]
I live life daily, scared to make babies
It's hard to plan your future when the world goin' crazy
Kids with no food, who can they turn to
beside they own people, I swear this world evil
They see us on TV, they thinkin' we should be
The main ones providin' for our community
But the government is paid, dishin' out minimum wage
They don't care about the streets, as long as they get paid
My advice is please vote, don't take it as a joke
Cause five years from now the world could be gone in smoke
Now everybody's gone, cause they ain't stand strong
And vote for a leader that can lead our country home
We got people in Iraq, tell me why they cain't come home
If you care about your future please listen to the song
We got people in Iraq, tell me why they cain't come home
If you care about your future please listen to the song

[Chorus]

[Mike Jones]
I think about my homies, I think about my momma
I think about what's goin' on I think about the drama
I think about the world, I think about my life
Five years from now, will I have me a wife?
Will I have me some kids, tell me how will I live
Will I be doin' wrong or will I live positive
Will I live to get a Grammy or will I be with my granny
Five years from now, I don't think you understand me
I'm tryin' to hold on, tryin' to stay strong
It's hard not knowin' what's really goin on
But I try to maintain, keep my head in the game
When shit ain't lookin' too good, I pray for better things
I keep the Lord on my side, 'til the day I die
Will I blow up big?  I don't know but I'll try
I keep the Lord on my side, 'til the day I die
Will I blow up big?  I don't know but I'll try

[Chorus]

[Mike Jones]
How could you think about the future when the world goin' crazy
Kids havin' kids, they too young to make babies
I'm livin' in the world so sheisty and shady, Mike Jones, Jones
Five years from now will I be dead, boxed up
Or in the pen for ten like a con, locked up
Tell me how would I live, will I have me some kids?
Will I blow up big in showbiz, five years from now

Where would I go, where would I stay,

April 14th was when, I felt I lost a friend
I damn near stopped rapping, damn near stopped pimpin pens
Cousin locked in the pen, when will this drama end
I get success but it feels like my stress begins
At 17 thought I was grown, had to move on
Moved out T. Jones home, had to do this on my own
My grandma left my life, I felt it wasn't right
I get awards and I break down and I cry on sight
Cause she ain't here with me, but I know she hearing me
Beg and plead, that she could still be here next to me
Even though you passed and left, yo' memories are kept
In my mind, heart, and soul, even on my shelf
Now I'm left with cousin Shelly, Jessie, and they real, and Gary
(?) and my brother, Uncle June, and my mother and
Even though sometimes I get too busy to touch you
From me to y'all I want y'all to know I love you

Latran playing ball, I pray to God he goes pro
And Gary Jr. getting bigger, I just thought I'd let you know
That the family's okay, everything's cool and straight
Juanita and Nicky just told me to tell you they said hey
And I pray day to day that the Lord'll pave the way
And you keep looking down here just smiling, just showing ya pretty face
And I still hang around my homies that you see while you were here
Oh and my girl better than ever, she too wish you was here
You know I'm grown now, so I'm putting food on the table
24 years old and I got my own label
Ice Age Entertainment, we about to take it over
T. Boy rappin now, he's Mellow, and Wally is Lil' Soldier
(?) still rolls with me, we close shoulder to shoulder

ride around town in my candy car,
diamonds shine like a star.
I love to grip that wood grain,
love to talk that Texas slang,
I spend change like it ain't no thing nigga.
Because down south we be tipping on fo's,
in the parking lot pimping these hoes,
its M.O.B. on every hoe nigga.
Down in H-Town we gripping on grain,
flipping on swings sipping that drank,
causing pain in the turning lane nigga.
(Holla at me) 281-330-8004
Hit Mike Jones up on the low (Yeah)

They better stop playing,

You roll a square and po a cup.

Shyeah
Keep ya eyes open
For them jackers, baby
It's goin' down

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it
'cause I ain't about to go down

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it
'cause I ain't about to go down

They see me doin' my shiit, that's why they in my miix
Jackers plottin' along watchin' like I'm movin' bricks
But I ain't move nothin', I'm on my grind hustlin'
Come at me wrong and my chrome gon' give you a concussion

I love to ride fresh, but hate to ride with Tecs
But the way that these jackers roll up, knowin' for the best
With diamonds on my neck, bulletproof vest on chest
I got my own laws, I'm here to serve and protect
Myself, because they ain't finna get me
I'm in the club sober as fuck and you won't catch me tipsy

Nigga! Yeah! I'm Mike Jones
Who? Mike Jones

So they can't out hold it
'cause I ain't about to go down

Even though the laws patrollin'

So they can't out hold it
'cause I ain't about to go down

The way that I pull up, I got the jackers lookin' at me
24's and swingers, sold the candy and got me caffie
And I don't give a damn if they rollin'
'cause my top gets folden, the AK I'm holdin'
'cause I ain't about to go down

Presidential when we ride with the trunk open heat
Clothes tryin' to jack playboy
You get three slugs to ya throat and I'm fo' sho' 'cause they don't know
I'm on a mission to get paid
Tryin to plot or set me up you get ya whole block sprayed

And I ain't knockin' ya hustle but a hollow head will hurt
In the heat of the moment, let's see if that heat gon buck first
And I'm a aim for the worst to make a jacker fall flat
And if I do get jacked, you better believe
I'm comin' back in all black, CJ

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it
'cause I ain't about to go down

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it
'cause I ain't about to go down

I'm down the boulevard flippin', jammin' ""Still Tippin""
See them jackers watchin' like I ain't payin' attention
But really, I'm lookin' at them boys like they silly
'cause I know their handguns ain't gon' fuck wit this Milly

'cause I'm a pistol packer for them jackers that try to attack us
No need to call the po po, 'cause my fo fo gon' be my back up
Act up, if you wanna and I swear you'll be a goner
I put it all on my mama, you niggaz don't want no drama

It's Mellow, king of the hill, don't think I ain't holdin' that steel
When I pull up in that Deville, you crumb niggaz better chill
I'm from the streets I'm real, I grind hard for the scrill
I major without a deal, gotta keep it hot wheels

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it
'cause I ain't about to go down

Even though the laws patrollin'

The way you move in that Bentley now you got more than one enemy
Trying to take you out nope, that's why you ride with ya scope
Or aim the infrared beamer straight to they throat
So if you ever in fear of your life, you put steel HERE in they life
Cause you ain't going down, especially not tonight
I never ever trusted hoes because they got a plan
They don't want me for me they want me because I got some Grants
It's sad when you down nobody lends a helping hand
But when you blow up and don't help them you ? man
My grandma told me watch these hoes because they got a plan
To get your paper that's why I keep my shit in my pants
You're on your own 'til your gone that's what I was told

They saying they want to commit, because your paper legit
The minute you go bankrupt the second they gon' split
Now yo' ass ain't got shit
Listening to that bitch got you flat broke quick
If you was straight from the streets you'll know that that bitch
Was from the jump a hoe, playing you for your dough
But I guess you thought I was hating when I was keeping it real
I'll bet you goin' listen now cause she got you for your scrill
So let this lesson be told to those who got caught
You tried to pay for some pussy that already been bought
You told the hoe where you lived, cause you thought that the bitch was real
Same time she was one of them niggas inside your crib
I can't let it happen to me, so I watch 'em from 50 feet
I'd rather have money comin than be with these scandalous freaks
I can't let it happen to me, so I watch 'em from 50 feet
I'd rather have money comin than be with these scandalous freaks

The main ones providin for our community
But the government is paid, dishin out minimum wage
They don't care about the streets, as long as they get paid
My advice is please vote, don't take it as a joke
Cause five years from now the world could be gone in smoke
Now everybody's gone, cause they ain't stand strong
And vote for a leader that can lead our country home
We got people in Iraq, tell me why they cain't come home

Will I have me some kids, tell me how will I live
Will I be doin wrong or will I live positive
Will I live to get a Grammy or will I be with my granny
Five years from now, I don't think you understand me
I'm tryin to hold on, tryin to stay strong
It's hard not knowin what's really goin on
But I try to maintain, keep my head in the game
When shit ain't lookin too good, I pray for better thangs
I keep the Lord on my side, 'til the day I die

April 14th was when, I felt I lost a friend
I damn near stopped rappin', damn near stopped pimpin' pens
Cousin locked in the pen, when will this drama end?
I get success but it feels like my stress begins
At 17 thought I was grown, had to move on
Moved out Jones home, had to do this on my own
My grandma left my life, I felt it wasn't right
I get awards and I break down and I cry on sight
My grandma left my life, I felt it wasn't right
I get awards and I break down and I cry on sight
My grandma left my life, I felt it wasn't right
I get awards and I break down and I cry on sight

'Cause she ain't here wit me, but I know she hearin' me
Beg and plead, that she could still be here next to me
Even though you passed and left, yo' memories are kept
In my mind, heart, and soul even on my shelf
Now I'm left with cousin Jessie and
Me and my brother June, my mother and
Even though sometimes I get too busy to touch you
From me to y'all I want y'all to know I love you

Grandma remember when we used to play
Them bones and you would skunk us
And you never had a problem punkin' us in front of company
Wally just had a son he's a daddy, I'ma uncle now
Wally just had a son he's a daddy, I'ma uncle now
Latran playin' ball, I pray to God he goes pro

And Gary Jr. gettin' bigger, I just thought I'd let you know
That the family's okay, every thang's cool and straight
Juanita and Nicky just told me to tell you they said, “Hey”
And I pray day to day that the Lord'll pave the way
And you keep lookin' down here just smilin', just showin' ya pretty face
And I still hang around my homies that you see while you were here
Oh and my girl better than ever, she too wish you was here

You know I'm grown now, so I'm puttin' food on the table
24 years old and I got my own label
Ice age entertainment, we about to take it over
T. Boy rappin' now he's mellow, and Wally is lil' soldier
Boy still rolls with me, we close shoulder to shoulder
That gator that you gave my granny I use it to sew the game up
Me and she was partners, we both now CEO's
It's all good but I wish you was able to see me grow

Oh grandma, I miss you
And wish I could kiss you and hug you girl
Oh grandma, I miss you
And wish I could kiss you and hug you girl

And I used to always tell my grandma
And she used to always tell me
To use that y'knahmsayin'?

And it's it's just crazy mayne y'know?
I started sayin' my name a lot y'knahmsayin'?
I started givin' my phone number out y'knahmsayin'?
When people was tellin' me that it wasn't gon' work
My grandma was tellin' me to do it y'knahmsayin'?

Shyeah
Keep ya eyes open
For them jackers, baby
It's goin' down

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it
'Cuz I ain't about to go down

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it
'Cuz I ain't about to go down

They see me doin' my shiit, that's why they in my miix
Jackers plottin' along watchin' like I'm movin' bricks
But I ain't move nothin', I'm on my grind hustlin'
Come at me wrong and my chrome gon' give you a concussion

I love to ride fresh, but hate to ride with Tecs
But the way that these jackers roll up, knowin' for the best
With diamonds on my neck, bulletproof vest on chest
I got my own laws, I'm here to serve and protect
Myself, because they ain't finna get me
I'm in the club sober as fuck and you won't catch me tipsy

Nigga! Yeah! I'm Mike Jones
Who? Mike Jones

'Cuz I ain't about to go down

Even though the laws patrollin'

So they can't out hold it
'Cuz I ain't about to go down

The way that I pull up, I got the jackers lookin' at me
24's and swingers, sold the candy and got me caffie
And I don't give a damn if they rollin'
'Cuz my top gets folden, the AK I'm holdin'
'Cuz I ain't about to go down

Presidential when we ride with the trunk open heat
Clothes tryin' to jack playboy
You get three slugs to ya throat and I'm fo' sho' 'cuz they don't know
I'm on a mission to get paid
Tryin to plot or set me up you get ya whole block sprayed

And I ain't knockin' ya hustle but a hollow head will hurt
In the heat of the moment, let's see if that heat gon buck first
And I'm a aim for the worst to make a jacker fall flat
And if I do get jacked, you better believe
I'm comin' back in all black, CJ

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it
'Cuz I ain't about to go down

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it
'Cuz I ain't about to go down

I'm down the boulevard flippin', jammin' ""Still Tippin""
See them jackers watchin' like I aint payin' attention
But really, I'm lookin' at them boys like they silly
'Cuz I know their handguns ain't gon' fuck wit this Milly

'Cuz I'm a pistol packer for them jackers that try to attack us
No need to call the po po, 'cuz my fo fo gon' be my back up
Act up, if you wanna and I swear you'll be a goner
I put it all on my mama, you niggaz don't want no drama

It's Mellow, king of the hill, don't think I ain't holdin' that steel
When I pull up in that Deville, you crumb niggaz better chill
I'm from the streets I'm real, I grind hard for the scrill
I major without a deal, gotta keep it hot wheels

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it
'Cuz I ain't about to go down

They think everyone else was runnin' now they see me comin',

They see me riding fours they see me stackin' dough,
They see the black on black phanton' on them 24's.

You know I'm comin through and ill be there with a sack

'cause you know how to act when you hit me on the cell
You don't be leavin me messages like you mad as hell
You tell me that your pussy's wet and you're thinking bout me
You know that you want it and you really just can't live without me
And I'll be glad to come but after that yo I got to go
'cause if you start talkin shit bitch I holla ho
Don't have patience for no naggin' ass broad
The one who ignore you when your dick get hard
They know when your dough run low so they be frontin'
They don't give you no pussy if you don't give them no money
But you know what time it is when I'm in your spine with this
You know that you'll never find a dick like I possess
You feel it all in your chest
Sometime it hurt but you can't help but say yes
As I push this dick all up in your bush
Bust a couple of nuts and then I fire up the kush
You put on your panties I put on my drawers
We'll holla next week when the sun falls

Why they got to hate on me?
(I don't know, I guess they love my swag, love my swag, love my swag)
Ha ha who? Mike Jones! Who? Mike Jones! Who? Mike Jones!
(? You a fool with this one)
I got a question:
(why they got to hate on me?) I wonder why
(why they got to hate on me) ay, ay (why they got to hate on me)
I wonder why (why they got to hate on me) ??

[VERSE 1]
I swear to god I came from nothing to something
I ain't get no handouts I got mine from hustling
Hustlin from nothing to something
I had to get it no time to play with it, my money I was committed
And when I got my paper, my paper, I split it
When everybody ?? was down with it
But all of a sudden everybody start hatin (why they hatin)
I don't know, why everybody hatin'
They see me on them 22s givin boys the blues
When they see me shinin they don't have a clue
They be like who is that? I be like Mike Jones!
I'm like Pimp see - I got a (Pocket Full of Stones)
But it ain't work, homie it's my CD's
And I sold about 2 million in the streets
So why they hatin me? 'cause I pull up Jet Li
With the eighty fos and fos on that new Bentley
So I ask:

[CHORUS (Tanya Herron)]
Why they got to hate on me? Why they got to hate on me
(I wonder why) why they got to hate on me?
(I wonder why I wonder why)
Why they got to hate on me? Why they got to hate on me?
Why they got to hate on me?

[VERSE 2]
I spent a half million in the city baby (how much)
A half billion in the city baby
'97 ? boxster know how much I spent
I swear to god when it come to paper I ain't got no mint
When people needed money they'd holla at me
I swear to god when they needed it they holla'd at me
Club ice age I put everyone on they feet
Then they turn around and ? damn
I see y'all out there hatin on me
But I got the world waitin on me
They waitin on me why are they haiting on me
I ask the lawd but I ain't trippin get inside the booth and press record
I'm a g and these streets said that I ain't got to answer to nobody
Especially the ones with no ? so far ahead that they can't catch up
Why they wastin os on me tryin to set me up?

[CHORUS Repeats]

[VERSE 3]
Tell me, what have I done to you? What have I done to you
To make you all hate on me ay ay
What have I done to you what have I done to you
To make y'all hate on me
They see me shinin in the limelight
They see me shinin by myself and they say that I ain't right
Why is it that I had to grind on my own baby
V12 yeah I'm rollin on that chrome baby
I know he mad 'cause he lyin ? my name in your brain

Ma he's almost breaking my heart,

Let his conscience guide him!
Ma, he wants to marry me,

Now he's leaning on my shoulder,

Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine

I left her and threw away the key to paradise

That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Mike Leon Grosch,"It's late in the evening; she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, Do I look all right?
And I say, ""Yes, you look wonderful tonight

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me, Do you feel all right?
And I say, ""Yes, I feel wonderful tonight""

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

When you awake you will remember ev'rything, 
You will be hangin' on a string from your
When you believe, 
You will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know

You can take to the left or go straight to the right,
Use your days and save your nights,
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat,
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat.

Ollie warned me it's a mean old world,
The street don't greet ya, yes, it's true;
But what am I supposed to do:
Read the writing on the wall,
I heard it when I was very small.

Wash my hand in lye water, 
I got a date with the captains daughter. 
You can go and tell your brother. 
We sure gonna love one another, oh! 
You may be right and ya might be wrong, 
I ain't gonna worry all day long.

Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite, 
My old car froze up last night.

That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day
And everything's okay.

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain.
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain.

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea,
The clouds broke, they broke and oh what a break for me.

I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in a storm.
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm.

It's wonderful, so they say
And with the moon up above, it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me

I can't recall who said it
I know I've never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand, and
The thing that's known as romance
Is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

To leave your house some morning
And without any warning, you're stopping people,
Shouting that love is grand, and
To hold a man in your arms is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say",They Say It's Wonderful
Mike Marshall,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear

This nine pound hammer is a little too heavy
For my size, honey, for my size

Roll on buddy, don't you roll so slow
Baby, how can I roll when the wheels won't go

Up on the mountain just to see my honey
And I ain't coming back, lord, I ain't coming back

It's a long way to Hazard a long way to Harian
Just to get a little booze, just get a little boos

She had eyes bright enough to burn me. They reminded me of yours.

You make me happy whoa!  The skies are gray and gray and gray.

Packed a few things and drove you back again
Stayed up all night worrying, wondering
What was gonna make it better

Broken bones heal if you set them right
Get your fine tooth comb from the barbicide
Our love's a protective poison
But you are your mother's child
And she'll keep you for a while
One day you'll be grown, then you'll be on your own

Halloween costume, looking real cute
With your pillowcase full, in your astronaut suit
Your cousin the cowboy, he's eyeing your loot
Better watch your Snickers bar

Out on the diamond, then you're up to bat
Chewing your big league, adjusting your hat
Taking a swing and hearing it crack
Look at that apple fly

Tears will dry if you give them time
Life's a roller coaster, keep your arms inside
Fear that's a big emotion
But you are your mother's child
And she'll have you for a while
But someday you'll be grown, then you'll be on your own

Posing for pictures, cap and a gown
Summer is coming, you're driving around town
Everyone's asking what you're gonna do now
I know you're gonna make a splash

And find you a sweetheart to treat you so kind
Take her to dinner and kiss her goodnight
What I couldn't teach you, soon you will realize
She's the only thing that matters

Although he's a bastard, make your papa proud
Your a fine young man and I got no doubt
That you're gonna do this better
Because you are your mother's child
She had you for a while
But now you are grown, and you're making it on your own
Well now that you're grown, may you never feel this alone",You Are Your Mother's Child
Mike Moreno,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Mike Murley,"There's a story the gypsies know is true
That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.
An old love story that's known to very few,
But if you wear those golden earrings,
Love will come to you.

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul.
So be my gypsy,
Make love your guiding light,
And let that pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight.",Golden Earrings
Mike Ness,"I'm young and I'm strong
I've got this God forsaken world by the balls!
I've got a one-way ticket to freedom
Ain't got no one now gonna take it from me

In a war I'm not sure what I was fighting for
And yet I turned from a boy to a man there
Goodbye to innocence and a sweet sixteen

My whole life I could not arrange 
My wicked ways I could never change

Close to me is a photograph
Of a family left far, far behind
At once I had love it slipped away from

Mike Ness,"Some say it's the strong who survive
Sometimes I wonder if there's any truth to that at all
I've been lucky and that's a fact in a crazy world
I've led a charmed life

I know judges and I know priests
I know gangsters, bad cops and lawyers too
But I don't need none of them to sing this song
I've led a charmed life

Chorus:
No this ain't no hard luck story
Some have had better and some have had worse
Then again until you've walked my way
You'd have to say I've led a charmed life

I'm not so scared of dying
I've got my health , my friends and family too
I'm just afraid of living and not being sure
I've led a charmed life

Chorus:
No this ain't no hard luck story
Some have had better and some have had worse
But then again until you've walked in my shoes
You'd have to say I've led a charmed life

Bridge:
When the dice come tumbling down I'll be waiting
To see what luck comes my way
When the cards get passed around I'll be waiting
To see what hand I should play

And I say, ""even in the worst of times against all odds,
I seem to have led a charmed life.""

Mike Ness,"You can lie to yourself, You can lie to the world
You can lie to the one you call your girl
You can humble yourself to the hearts that you stole
Wondering who's gonna love you when you grow old

With a fistful of courage and a heart full of rage 
I realized I'd locked myself in a cage
I'll be the one standing there with the watery eyes
I'll be the fool in the mirror asking me ""why?""

Asking ""Why?""

When I got to the end of my dirty rainbow
And I found that there was no pot of gold
Well I'd learned that I was empty and not quite as strong
For I'd robbed my heart and cheated my soul

Look for the one with the watery eyes 
I'll be the fool in the mirror asking me ""why?""

But this song ain't about none of the above
We're not punished for our sins, but ""by them""
Thought I'd get myself a little passion play

My poor heart is aching
It never did before
It seems my ""indiscretion"" served a ""painful lesson""

I tried to mix romance with deceit
A little pleasure now with my pain
And I felt the loss on judgment day

But take heed my friends to this warning I give
Before you're faced with all your fears

Give me your heart
Give me your soul

Your daddy had a funny way
Of showing you his love

That burns like a fire
And you realize you've been blessed
With a wild desire

Vanished in the wind

I see my lover's face and I watch her teardrops fall

And in the end, you know a dope fiend ain't got no friends
And a junkie is a junkie to the bitter end
Hope to die now, 'cause you know I'm better off dead
Hey brother, won't you lend me a helpin' hand?

I tie myself off, shoot it in my veins
I feel like Marlon Brando and I've hid another day's pain
I'm goin' back where it's safe, goin' back to the womb
I find my mother's comfort, here in a needle and spoon

And Christmas for a dope fiend ain't no fun
Waiting for good times that seem to never come
Goin' out now, gonna get myself a gun
Please stop me, don't you know I'm on the run?

Aren't you tired of the detox and the places in the mind?
Aren't you tired of the misery, aren't you tired of doin' time?

Aren't you glad, that no one seems to care what we do?
Aren't you glad there ain't no one here to tell us what's right or wrong?

Mike Ness,"Ten years ago, on a cold dark night
Someone was killed, 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me

The judge said son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, thou it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees

In a long black veil, she cries ov're my bones

I lurked the streets late at night

Yeah but happiness is a funny thing
And misery just loves company

What goes on inside this man
As a boy I used to dream

Or why I'm so disturbed
Unless you got a couple of good hours

You talk of truth, honor and respect
You talk of living, but you haven't lived
Seems to me you're always on the take
That's because you ain't got nothing to give

Chorus:
Don't ask me why! I will not pretend!
Just walk on by! 'cause today I'm no man's friend!

Seems to me you got a couple of your wires crossed
You're in the right place at the wrong time!

But you're sure taking up space in my mind!

Seen a lot of one night stands
But still I find myself so very much alone

And it took those years to find myself
Wasn't lookin' for no one else
And then I found you girl
But you were there all along

And we'll spend each day 
Like it's the last day of the rest of our lives

I'll be the king you'll be my wife
Gonna make it through this thing called life
Gonna raise these kids on our own
The very best we can

And sixteen hours is a long, long time
When you gotta love that's on your mind
Can you tell me that I'm not right?
I'm a little distraught

And we'll spend each day
Like it's the last day of the rest of our lives
Everyday we'll fall in love just a little more
For the rest of our lives

Sittin' here in the county jail
Ain't no one to go to my bail
I shoulda been there with you
For some sympathy and tea

And eighteen years in a traveling band
Seen a lot of one night stands
And still I find myself so very much alone

Mike Ness,"To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say,
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip,
big iron on his hip
It was early in the morning when he rode into town
He came riding from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
""He's an outlaw loose and runnin'"", came a whisper from each lip
""And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip,
big iron on his hip""
In the town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more,
one and nineteen more
Now the stranger started talkin' made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizonia ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He came there to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter that he was after Texas Red,
after Texas Red
Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry, men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip,
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
big iron on his hip
The morning past so quickly and it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out on the street
Folks were watchin' from their windows,
every body held their breath,
For they knew that handsome ranger was about to meet his death,
about to meet his death
There was forty feet between them
when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip,
big iron on his hip
It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered 'round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have gone on livin' but he made one final slip
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
big iron on his hip
Big iron, big iron,
He tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip,

Yea I couldn't lose with a pair of twos till a woman got in the game

Yea she won my old black panhead and she won my switch blade knife
And when I lost everything I had she told me to bet my life

Mike Oldfield,"Hey in a way we go 
though the grass across the snow
in brown beastie in brown face
I'd rather be with you than flying through space.

I like thunder and I like rain
and open fires and glowing flames
but if the thunder is in my brain
I'd like to be on horseback

Some like the city
some the noise
some main cows
and those toys
We though we all had a choice
I'd rather be on horseback

some find it strange we live
on this small planet
on who knows where
when it strange on flu fear
it's nice to be on horseback

some are sure
and other are told
some bang their heads agaist the rules
it doesn't really matter to them
when you have to be on horseback

in the summer winter 
rain or shine
is good to be on horseback

Mike Oldfield,"Speak, vision of the night,
Tell me why you haunt me so.
Speak, heaven morning light,
Whisper all my heart would know.
Dawn, ever finds you gone
Back to where the shadows dwell.
Speak, my beloved, speak,
Tho' you only say farewell.

When doubts and fears cause their tears that blind me,
Why be down if you've come to find me?
Speak to me and I'll follow,
Leaving all the wold behind me.
Can those eyes, calm and wise, deceive me?
While I still know the thrill of your
Mystic shade, dare fade and leave me,
Arms high and low.

Speak, vision of the night,
Tell me why you haunt me so.
Speak, heaven morning light,
Whisper all my heart would know.

Back to where the shadows dwell.

Tho' you only say farewell.

Mike Oldfield,"      Queen and huntress chaste and fair.
      Now the sun is laid to sleep,
      Seated in a silver chair,
      State in wanted manner keep.

      Earth let not an envious shade
      Dare itself to interpose.
      Cynthia's shining orb was made
      Heaven to cheer when day did close.

      Lay the bow of pearl apart,
      And the crystal-shining quiver,
      Give unto the flying heart
      Space to breathe how short so ever

      Hesperus entreats thy light

      Bless us then with wished sight

As the sunlight shines through the window,
will you remember the night,
The night, that crazy starlight
There are...
Pictures in the dark,
see all around

The moon shines starlight beams
And you'll be flying in your dreams.

Mike Oldfield,"There was a mistake under the weather
One shout's gonna turn into another
It's a heartbreak under the weather
Standing out in the cold

Highway is frightening
Rain hammering on your window
I hate sheet lightning
You reach for the telephone

[Chorus]
Mistake under the weather
One shout's gonna turn into another
It's a heartbreak under the weather
Standing out in the cold

I pray for blue skies
Rain hammering on your window
On your way, you wonder why
You're spending on your own

[Chorus]

And talking on the radio
You never know how to say
Anything's a plan that could be on your mind
It could vanish in a tragical way
Get lost in dreaming
Rain hammering on your window
Try to catch the meaning
You're dancing on your own

Mike Oldfield,"Taking on water,
Sailing a restless sea
From a memory,
A fantasy.
The wind carries
Into white water,
Far from the islands.

Never going to get to France.

Never going to get to France.

Like a shadow,
Roaming in far off

Mike Oldfield,"Islands, from the first time we saw,
We could wait for this moment, like rocks on the shore.
We can never be closer, somehow,
For the moment that lasts, is this moment now.

When the night's on fire, will you keep the candlelight burning?
Hold on to your heart's desire. (When the night's on fire)
When you see one bird into the wind, another one's turning,
And the two can fly much higher.

Do you need love's arms to hold you?
It's a flame, there burns no finer.
When you see one bird,
There's another one watching over,
And the two can fly much higher.

I was hoping, would you shelter me from showers?
I believe every word in the candlelight.

Mike Oldfield,"The first time ever she saw him
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
He passed on worried and warning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night
Far away on the other side
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through

The trees that whisper in the evening
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
Far away on the other side
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through

I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day

Four a.m. in the morning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
I watched your vision forming
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Stars roll slowly in a silvery night
Far away on the other side
Will you come to terms with me this night
But she couldn't find how to push through

I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day

Far away on the other side
Caught in the middle of a hundred and five

Mike Oldfield,"Have you ever been to North Point
To spend your time and pray?
The prison walls are dark and cold and grey.
The writing on the wall at North Point
Speaks to a silent room.
They shut the bars down, leave you to the gloom.
How could we get any closer?
So high is the wire and the guards won't listen,
They won't believe me.
And then it all came back.
Somewhere far above has a new day risen?
Way beyond the searchlight,
Comes alive, comes alive.
Then on a bright day at North Point
The gate was open wide.
They chanced to look at what was inside.
There were a million stars at North Point,
And from the silent tomb,
They took it to the heart and left for the moon.
How could we get any closer?
So high is the wire and the guards won't listen,
They won't believe me.

The tall gates he passed through.

I need a saviour, and you're the one
I throw myself into the arms of mercy

Better come back to your senses
There's an empty bottle lying on the floor
And it's undermined your defences

And it seems like a hundred years

I can see a light past the fences
Standing at the borderline
I've come to the end of the line

One more hour, and I'm coming alive

Through the edge of the night

Oh, I can see the light

The most precious thing I possess
Is knowing the answer's yes

Will be reality
I've been given a second chance
I could open my arms and dance
Open that barricade
No longer I'm living afraid

Twisted 'round the smallest finger.
Two burning eyes are tearing you apart,
Turn your soul into a cinder.
There's no rest, you're possessed.
You can't leave, you can't breathe.
The door slams, your head hangs.
You blank stare, you don't care.
If you open your eyes just far enough,
You see the street lamps flicker.
Go on, fight to the end, it's tough enough
When you know the end is bitter.

You're number's up, you're eyes shut.
You're on the brink, you can't think.
You wanna run, but you're stunned.

Mike Oldfield,"Hello everyone
I suppose you think that nothing much is happening at the moment
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
Well, that's what I want to talk to you all about; endings
Now, endings normally happen at the end
But as we all know, endings are just beginnings
You know, once these things really get started, it's jolly hard to stop them again
However, as we have all come this far, I think, under the circumstances 
The best solution is that we all just keep going
Let's keep this going in sight, never an ending
Let's remember that this world wants fresh beginnings
I feel here, in this country, and throughout the world, 
we are crying out for beginnings, beginnings
We never want to hear this word ""endings""
I know we all want to sit down
I know you want to take it easy 
Of course we're looking for the good
Of course we're looking for the fresh start
Isn't that charming? Do you know, I really feel I could dance

Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, charming, ha-ha-ha

It's waiting for you.
The face of destiny
Standing before you.

Can you feel that power inside of you?
This priceless moment
In your possession.
Answers to mysteries
Stand in succession.
This is zero hour and there's no way back.
Can you feel that power? In its arms you're wrapped
All through the night-time
'Til the sun comes in.
Now Heaven's open.
Just fly right in.
Now you stand in that garden,
This is that vision.
Out on the world's edge,
It's your baptism.
This is zero hour and your hands are free.
Can you feel that power? It's ecstasy!
All through the night-time,
'Til the sun comes in.
Now Heaven's open.
Fly right in.
Waiting for night-time
'Til the sun comes in.
All through the night-time,
Let the blue sky in.

Mike Oldfield,"The first time ever she saw him
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
He passed on worried and warning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night
Far away on the other side
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through

The trees that whisper in the evening
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
Far away on the other side
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through

I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day

Four a.m. in the morning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
I watched your vision forming
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Stars roll slowly in a silvery night
Far away on the other side
Will you come to terms with me this night
But she couldn't find how to push through

I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day

I'm longing to be
Where the beauties of heaven
Unfold by the sea
Where the sweet purple heather blooms
Fragrant and free
On a hilltop high above

So gentle the sea breeze
That ripples the bay
Where the stream joins the ocean
And young children play
On the strand of pure silver
I'll welcome each day
And I'll roam for ever more

Had your chance, you just threw it all away.
Living in a world that you could never be a part of
And never time to walk away.

You can't stay, no, you can't stay.
You're no loser, there's still time to ride that train
And you must be on your way tonight.
Think anew right through, you're a man in the rain.

What's the use in hanging round these walls.
Lamps are burning, but nobody's at home.
There's a new day dawning as a cold rain falls
And now's the time to walk alone.

You can't stay, no, you can't stay.
You're no loser, there's still time to ride that train
And you must be on your way tonight.
Think anew right through, you're a man in the rain.

Form their ranks for Armageddon

But products have taught us that winning is better then fun as young children 
And scuffling wins in the end

But children in school grow up to be cowboys 
Who like to watch cattle be tortured for fun entertainment

Landing on my upper lip formed from some tissue 
I still feel a lump from where fist turns to a weapon 
On this day I wonder how fighting wins over a peace train 
A song with a vision much stronger than my will could ask for 
Lying here useless on this day where skies are much bluer than oceans

Standin' right along side of you
Wish I could show you how much I care

Mike Pinto,"My drink impairs my ability
To drive a car
And operate machinery
It leaves me problems with my health, and my wealth
I'm pissin away my paycheck, I need help, I need help
I got a case of bad luck, what the deal, what the fuck
Do I gotta do? to get past the shit that I'm goin through
I guess I'll write these words, and hope this alcohol controls my nerves

I'm living among fools, I say I'll learn from their mistakes
I know that it's untrue, I'll only learn from notes I take
Now how can I show you my real concept for what's at stake
The worst decision is the one you're too scared to make
People let me shed a little light on this subject
Spread the word to the general public
About the clouds that follow me around my head
Enough to make me dread
Even the comfort of my bed
I try to relax and just kick it
But parking tickets
Make me wanna tell the cops to stick it
And as I sink deeper into debt
Some stupid motherfucker stole my cds and my tape deck
Out with my ride
And now I'm screamin why why why's
Every night and day filled with fuckin misery
It's a mystery
That's killin me
If only I had the ability
To learn just a little bit of self control
Maybe I could find a way to save my soul
And hide from every cop that ever came my way
But it's Saturday
Motherfucker, I just got paid, yeah

go ahead, just leave me
I'll be on the floor if you need me
Man, it's been a long day
I didn't even pay my tab
One more night like this
And I'll be checkin into rehab
Too drunk to drive my car home
Too bad I broke my damn phone
'cause I'd be callin up the numbers of my so-called friends
Tellin them what I really think about them
I swear, I swear while I'm still breathin
I'm gonna quit this drinkin for no reason
Whoa whoa
Who am I kiddin
Tomorrow evenin, we'll do it all over again
Yeah yeah
We'll do it all over again

Every word that you say keeps on bouncing around in my head
When all my delusions of grander have turned into bad jokes instead
You'll be there pointing and laughing to prove you were wiser than I

If God puts one in my head, that's what he wants
I'm a simple type of artist, I don't like to walk red carpets
I would rather write one hell of a song
Yeah, I wrote this and it's one hell of a song",One Hell of a Song
Mike Posner,"So, you don't know how to explain heaven? Well, god knows

Only God knows
Only God knows
Only God knows how hard I've been trying
Only God knows
Only God knows
Only God knows the trouble on my mind

There's more to life than living a wise man told me this
Or maybe it was me who wrote it, I can't remember which
In any case what I mean, life's an unfinished poem
Don't go mad trying to figure out the ending
The day that Norman died, I found out through an email
The irony of that, I will not discuss in detail
My future is on thin ice and my past is all online
But only God knows the trouble on my mind

Only God knows
Only God knows
Only God knows how hard I've been trying
Only God knows
Only God knows
Only God knows the trouble on my mind

My walls are filled with artwork, my art is filled with paint
My head is filled with big old thoughts of all the things I ain't
I bet you know what that's like, though you never drop your guard
Only God knows the places that you're scarred
I'm sitting on a park bench in a city I don't know
Trying to convince myself that I'm not all alone
But my immediate surroundings suggest otherwise
Only God knows the trouble on my mind

Only God knows how hard I've been trying

Never seemed to have no dough
Somehow, I never once got lonely

And most all your would be friends
Turn out so phoney
Oh but times they change
And rearrange

And I'll sing to the Queen of Hearts

Or how to stop

And after things have come and gone
Left me feelin'
That I've done so wrong
Oh, I wasted so much time
Feelin' guilty
And as I watch you sit across the room
Beautiful as the flowers bloom
T'Leave it lay just one day
Oh brother you're gonna come back
To find it gone

I love you queen of Hearts
Tell me not to stop
Just tell me where
To start
Where now baby
Tell me where to start

And after all that we've been through
I find that when I think of you
A warm soft wind runs
Through and through
And in my heart
There's only you
And I will always keep on trying
To gather this strange piece of mind
Without it there'd be
Lonely me and

The night we met
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square

I may be right I may be wrong
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square

The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love
The whole damned world seemed upside down

The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berekeley Square

How strange it was
How sweet and strange
There was never a dream to compare
To those hazy crazy nights we met
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square

Ah this heart of mine
Loud and fast
Like a merry-go-round in a fair
We would dance cheek to cheek
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square

The dawn came stealing up
All gold and blue
To interrupt our rendez-vous
I still remember how you smiled and said
Was that a dream or was it true?

Mike Rutherford,"There never was a moment I wasn't sure
I would be someone who roamed the world
And when the time was ready and so was I
get out of here onto the streets
Who'll make everything better, who'll make everything better.

The life that I was living, the great outdoors
Stars up above me every night, as I lay down my head
Who'll make everything better, who'll make everything better.

Get out of bed I hear them singing all along the way
You're where you want to be out on the open road again
Ain't that peculiar, you're on you're own again
You're on your own, on your own, I guess you always were.

One day you come to realize you're getting old
No one to share the lonely days, to be together
Who'll make everything better, who'll make everything better.

Get out of bed I hear them singing all along the way

But now I'm home again back in my old place
And though you're not quite sure you think you see me by the door
I'll be there.

When the winter comes knocking on the door
And you've the firelight dancing on the floor
In the dead of night when every star is burning bright
I'll be there

I am always there to see you through the night
Time and time again
Rest your tired head and it will be alright
and after all is said, is said and done

Just how lonely life can be for me.

So let me tell you now what it's like to be
The one whose memories are scattered on the sea
When the wind goes down you'll see them lying all around.

On a cloudy day, high up in the sky
There's a lonely bird who's sailing round and round
Looking for a place to land down on the ground, for a while
Over and over again
Please give your love to me
Throw it in the wind and I'll be there.

Deep within the darkness I'm the shadow next to yours
I'll be there.

Overlooking Findhorn Bay
Cluny Hill in the distance
Summer on the way

Blue skies and sailing boats
Like a picture in a book
I can't believe I got here
Or how long it took

Living one step at a time
Putting one foot in front of the other
It sure feels right

Healing on my mind
Been a long way
Been a long way to the light

I'd made it to Manhattan
Built myself a nest
I meant to get right back to doing
Exactly what I do best

Plugging in an electric guitar
Leading a band
Well, if you want to give God a laugh
Tell him your plans

Summer in the city
Wilting in the heat
Buzzing up and down to Bearsville
And back to Hudson Street

I learned meditation
And how to visualize
Just breathing, being still
Never felt more alive

Living one step at a time
Putting one foot in front of the other
It sure feels right

Healing on my mind
Been a long way
Been a long way to the light

I spent the fall in transit
Circling the moon
Like a cat on a hot tin roof
Like a fiddle without a tune

I found what I was searching for
In Mrs. Caddy's book
I had to go there straightaway
Have myself a look

I flew back to Scotland
Anticipation in my bones
The old country welcoming me
Like a prodigal coming home

I knelt and kissed the tarmac
In the wild Atlantic rain
Felt the fiery Gaelic blood
Rising in my veins

Living one step at a time
Putting one foot in front of the other
It sure feels right

Healing on my mind
Been a long way
Been a long way to the light

I spent the night in Glasgow
Flew to Inverness
I found the place and at the first
I was not impressed

Nobody said hello
The faces left me cold
Back then how was I to know
All that would unfold?

I entered the Sanctuary
Heard the voice of a girl
Sending out a circle of light
Clear across the world

I shuddered in the Power
Like a seedling in a storm
I've been traveling to this place
Since the moment I was born

I flew back to New York City
Singing the big city blues
The sand of Findhorn Bay
Still clinging to my shoes

Tried to restart my life
But the life I knew was gone
I had to let go everything
But that's another song

Living one step at a time
Putting one foot in front of the other
It sure feels right

Healing on my mind
Been a long way
Been a long way to the light
A long way to the light

So I'm sitting in my bedroom
Overlooking Findhorn Bay
Cluny Hill in the distance
Summer on the way

I'm watching the sailing boats
Bobbing to and fro
Time to hit the road
The only way I know

Living one step at a time
Putting one foot in front of the other
It sure feels right

You're pulling favours, casting them up

You talk hard but you don't listen

I'm a man in the hands of a child

Just trying to make up some miles
I've been out on this road so long
My edges are starting to curl
But I'll sleep when the first flush of Dawn
Softens the rim of the world

After all my turning this fire is still burning

Her fire was a fire of rage
Under her skin it spread
It festered and blew for an age
Then burst from the coils of her head
She cast up a tower of tears
But beauty broke it back down

Then woke up one day and found

After all this time I'm still on the line
With a case to prove and a public to move
After all my turning this fire is still burning
And I'm back on show

Step on the gas and kiss the wind
Over the pass and peel that skin away

I always meant the sea to come to me

Mike Seeger,"I was born in East Virginia
North Carolina I did go
There I courted a fair young maiden
But her age I did not know

Oh her hair was dark and curly
And her cheeks were rosy red
On her breast she wore a lilly
Where I longed to lay my head

Molly dear, go ask your mother
If you my bride might ever be
If she says no, come back and tell me
And I'll run away with thee

No I'll not go ask my mother
Where she lies on her bed of rest
In her hand she holds a dagger
To kill the man that I love best

The ocean's deep and I can't wade it
And I have no wings to fly
I'll just get some blue-eyed boatman
For to row me o'er the tide

I'll go back to East Virginia
North Carolina ain't my home
I'll go back to East Virginia
Leave old North Carolina alone

I don't want your green back dollar
I don't want your watch and chain
All I want is you my darling
Say you'll take me back again

At my gate I'll always greet you
For you're the girl I tried to win",East Virginia Blues

Shinin' like some diamonds,
Like some diamonds in the sky.

3. Rather be in some lonely hollow
Where the sun don't ever shine,
Than to see you be another man's darling,
And to know that you'll never be mine.

With my suitcase in my hand,
Yes, march me away to the station,
I'm off to some far-distant land.

Sometimes I have ten dollars,

Pretty stars are made to shine,
Pretty girls are made for boy's love,

Used to do without it 
Let it go without a fight 
Used to cry about it 
Wonder when, wonder how 
Pray somehow, pray somehow

And it's really a matter of 
The benefit of the doubt 
When all you love is what you do 
You're doing what will get you through 
Just make this vow 
And it's easier now 

Used to hold a candle 
In the wind, in the rain 
Looking for an answer 
For a light along the way 
Far down another road 
See a sign, see the end 
See a true friend, see a true friend 

Well it's easier now

Mike Stern,"Folks here's the story 'bout Minnie the Moocher
She was a red-hot hoochie coocher
She was the roughest toughest frail
But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale

She messed around with a bloke named Smokie
She loved him though he was cokey
He took her down to Chinatown
And he showed her how to kick the gong around

She had a dream about the king of Sweden
He gave her things that she was needin'
He gave her a home built of gold and steel
A diamond car with p-platinum wheels

He gave her his townhouse and his racin' horses
Each meal she ate was a dozen courses
She had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes
She sat around and counted them all a million times

Poor Min, poor Min, poor Minnie

Spreading my stain on the world

And I noticed there wasn't a chair

Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed""

In the morning and started to laugh

Asking when I'm coming home now
I'd rather do this on my own now, I really mean it
'Cause fuck love, that shit is inconvenient
I ain't got the time ho, I'm on my grind though
Million dollars on the line, nope, I ain't sign no
'Cause every day I negate all the connotations
And people that try to hate and debate on my rise to greatness
But I swear, I swear it's all, good

Yeah, I swear it's all good
Man you know it's all
Good, good, good, good
She came with you, left with me

Yeah, I used to dream about
Showing the world what I dream about
Forget a mic, my whole life I thought it'd be the mound
I guess it's fitting how life threw me the curveball
Pops told me work till you make it, man, then work more
I guess I took that to heart
'Cause I've been working harder now than I did at the start and I
Won't stop 'till I get to the top
Till I can give all of my fam all the things that they want
But uh, there ain't no doubt, I continue to be the doubted
But that's just motivating, so where would I be without it?
'Cause the same people asking why you're doing it
Were asking how you did it
So fuck a critic, stay committed to your vision
They can't see it, it's yours
The top floor looks far when you can't get in the doors, but
It's crazy what you can see with your eyes closed
I swear I stay on my grind mode

Uh my whole life's been a chase, it's a gift and a curse
Was on my way up to the top and slipped into reverse
And the same thing I thought killed me brought out the real me
And that's real, see
You gotta find what you love and let it kill you
Just gotta live with the will like Uncle Phil do
'Cause on the real, everybody go through times
When the sun don't shine
Don't know when our time will come, but it will come in time
'Cause yo, I said it first, ain't no telling where I'm headed
So this is for the people that was with me when I said it
And when I said it, I meant it, I swear I won't forget it
Told my family and my friends that I'm forever indebted

She was daddy's little girl, came from a small town
The type of chick that everybody would talk about
Only nineteen, but her body was mean, she was a beauty queen
So she moved to Hollywood to pursue a dream
And just like she thought she would, she hit it big
Signed a deal, and every day she had a gig
It was crazy all the sudden, she had all the success now
But the pressure had her stressed out
And she was always getting drunk now, always in the club now
With all the cool new friends, who had the drugs round
So they would skip the lines, then they'd sniff the lines
And pretty soon, she was doing this shit all the time
And it was cool; at least she thought it was
Till she couldn't smile without all the drugs
She was a beautiful girl, but inside she was hurting
That's why she's hiding cuts all under her David Yurmans

Was the kind of kid who never put his football down
See, his mama was a teacher and his pops used to play
Back in the day, he was top quarterback in the state
But hey, nowadays his son's wearing that letterman
Pops been drilling him his whole life to play like a veteran
Damn, all of these touchdowns have always been part of the plan
But that plan wasn't his
Life feeling like a lie, he was scared he couldn't live any longer
That's why them pain meds getting stronger
The same ones that he said for his shoulder
Thoughts in his head getting colder
'Cause his reality was too embarrassing to let his parents in
And anybody at all, he had nobody to call
They wouldn't get it or accept it
So he filled his mouth up with pills so they'd never know

Running in circles and I'm searching to know where it ends
Or where it begins, over and over and over again

Drowning in your lies and I can't breathe a word of truth

Okay, I got what you need though
Getting paid just to kick it, Ronaldinho
That's like every motherfucking city we go
Screaming out ""fuck you"" like I'm Cee-Lo
Oh that's just me though
And I'm just living mine, I ain't got time to be mad at you
You ain't running shit, you got less miles than Baton Rouge
And haters gonna hate, even when they know it's hot
Crowd so fucking big that it look Photoshopped
Homie, but you know it's not
This life so real that it seem fake
Spend the night, have the time of your life like Green Day
And you already know that all these girlies love me
She suck me and she fuck me and she the one that feel lucky
I'm a motherfucking killer, don't be mad at the man
Name a motherfucker realer, don't be mad when you can't
I live every line I write and never made an exception
Started getting paid, they started paying attention
That's real

Hardly local, man I got a crib on both coasts
Catch me riding through the city down in SoHo
Got all these bad bitches in my phone though
But you already know though
I'm ready to blow so, I never got it on safety
Whip all black, Donald Sterling would hate me
And I ain't sign nothing, the rumors are mistaken
Labels wanna hit, well shit I got about eight of them
Lawyers on beast mode, ain't nobody playing him
Fuck a single, bitch, I'm about to hit it out the stadium
So let me show you what I've been on, crossover like Iverson
I'm getting faded on the flight, call me Denzel
And they can't believe I'm white, Johnny Manziel
I pray they get well
And is it just me, or is it just me?
And that's just how I feel, you know the deal already

Different day, different stage, shit the same, still ballin'
Man that sound awesome, don't it?
And I hit the J then hit the stage then watch them hands go up like auctions
I'm not who they think I am
They tryna crop me out the pic but this ain't Instagram

Yeah, I've been taking shots cause my faded thoughts are my favorite ones
And my view is high, it ain't suicide but it'll make you jump
Can't tell me shit like I'm celibate, I don't give a fuck
And the answer's yes, I am up next and there ain't no discussion

And I don't really like it at all

So why
Do you say it ain't over
When you're already gone
Yeah why
Do you keep on believin'
That you've done nothing wrong

Hey girl what am I to you
Your soul mate
Or a broken toy
You know that I
See right through your lies
You know I won't let you deny it

I don't think I got nothing to lose
When it's already lost
Still you tell me it ain't that way
But you're already out the door

So Why
Do you say it ain't over
When you're already gone
Yeah why do you keep on believin'
That you've done nothing wrong
So why do you say it ain't over when you're already gone
Why do you try to deny it when the damage is done",Already Gone

Shot gun blast from a young mans past
Couldn't take no more
Had to even the score
Old man dies with the truth he denies
He won't harm no one
Not his only son
Standing with the gun on his shoulder
Never thought he'd live to be older

[Chorus]
Is he better off now
That his father is dead
Ever since a boy he's been trying to forget
Mama never was what a mother should be
But a loser
Such a loser

Jumped on his bike he would ride all night
Run away from it all
Leave the nightmare behind
Wake in the morning in a brand new place
Where the people he'd meet
Didn't know his face
He don't really know where he's going
And he can't forget where he's been

[Chorus ]

Fly on your wings
Up to the sky

On my darkest day would the sun shine bright
Had I not complained
Had I not restrained my love for you
Would I still be lying next to you
Had I not restrained

And I don't know why
I do the things I do
Yeah I don't know why
I never seem to make it through
Had I not complained to you
Had I not restrained from you
If I never had lied to you
Where would I be now
Should have shown respect for you
Should have never neglected you
Had I not complained to you
Where would I be now

Had I not complained could I still be here
And my finest hour growing near
Had I not complained
Had I turned my back on bad advice
Could I still be here for the big surprise
Had I turned away

If I had just
Followed you everywhere
Where would I be
Had I not complained",Had I Not Complained
Mike Tramp,"Have you ever told your mother
That she was more than God
And for all the life she gave you
You would give her twice as much
Have you ever told your father
You were angry that he left
And when both of you got older
Did you tell him you'd forgive
Yes I have

Have you ever loved your woman
With everything you got
Have you told her that without her
Life is really not a lot
Have you ever held your new born
And looked into his eyes
When you saw your own reflection
Were you man enough to cry
Yes I was

Should have done it long ago
Now I know
What I didn't long ago
And I know that life gets shorter
Every day we lose a day
So I want you all to know
That I love you

What do we wait for
When we keep our feelings
Locked up and to ourselves
We hesitate but soon we all regret
When we find the door has closed
And we're too late

Have you ever held a loaded gun
And pressed it to your head
Did you think of all the ones you loved
And the life that you have left
Have you ever told your friends
That they mean everything to you
Did you tell then that you'd be there
And help their dreams come true
Yes I have",Have You Ever

Maybe I won't make it through

I won't beg and borrow

That there ain't no way
That you can tie me down

Got a hold on me

I just live from day to day
I lay my body down
On the barren ground

Out through the door

Broken free now my wings can

From what she thought was just a dream
Looked around and saw it all was real
Packed her bags and ran away
Nothing here to make her stay
Free again she set out on her own

She never knew her life could be
All the things she dreamed of
If only she had realized
That there were so much more than

Living a lie, living a lie
Cause you're missing out
When you are living a lie

Flowers in the summer rain
How good it feels to smile again
Love is real when you are not afraid
Sally looked into his eyes
And saw a glimpse of paradise
Could it be what love is meant to be

She's not afraid not anymore
To seek what she desire
She dare to live the life she dreams
She wants to feel alive. not

Mike Tramp,"He could barely remember 
When the fighting began 
It was early September 
When he lost his old man 

Soon (the time) came to leave there 
And (to start) a new life 
How it seems so unfair 
When they (gave him a gun and a knife) 

So he fights with a gun in his hand 
For what reason he can't understand 
Fights with a gun in his hand

Can you hear a distant shout 
From the people in El Salvador

Still they kill not knowing why 
All the people in El Salvador 

As he stares at the ceiling 
He thinks back quite a ways 
It was (him that was) feeling 
tellin' you those were the days 

As he stares at a white dove 
Tears fall down on his face

Can you see them die? 
Can you tell me why? Oh no

Mike Tramp,"I went to a party
With a friend of mine
Had a couple of beers
And a bottle of wine

There were plenty of women
Dancing everywhere
They were dressed to kill
And knew what to do

She was so outstanding
I just had to make her mine
She could read me like a letter
I had one thing on my mind

She's got everything and I want it
Every little thing she's got is fine
She's got everything and I want it
Every little thing she's got is mine

So we left the party
And went to her place
You could see excitement
Written on my face

So she took me upstairs
Laid me on her bed
When she god undressed
I just lost my head

There were twenty years of woman
There was more than I could eat
She was ready, ripe and willing
I just knew she's taste so sweet

She's got everything, etc.
She was like a fire
She burned like a flame
She cried out my name

In her claim to fame
Then I saw her smiling
From her pretty eyes
She said little boy

Put the log into the fire
And bullets in the gun

And still I wish that I just knew

Where he didn't know

My brother is still in Vietnam
I know there's nothing good in war
I know 'cause I've been there before
So what am I gonna do
I know this war ain't through
And still I wish that I just knew

Mike Tramp,"Little child dry your crying eyes
How can I explain the fear you feel inside
Cause you were born into this evil world
Where man is killing man and no one knows just why
What have we become just look what we have done
All that we destroyed you must build again

When the children cry let them know we tried
Cause when the children sing then the new world begins

Little child you must show the way
To a better day for all the young
Cause you were born for all the world to see
That we all can live with love and peace
No more presidents and all the wars will end
One united world under God

Cause when the children sing then the new world begins

Made him do what he finally did

If y'all wanna hang out with the gangstas, y'all go 'head
I'm just gonna count a little mothafuckin' bread
If y'all wanna slither with the snakes then y'all go 'head

Tears of joy run down my cheek onto the soil
I would trick off on your bitch but she ain't loyal
Nothin' but love for you niggas ridin' with no tint
Grand total 5 digits make these hoes repent
Popped a couple pills, I feel like Johnny Mad Dog
I lost a couple friends, I'm tryna get these bands, dog
You know we in this bitch, we throwin' up them grands, y'all
And once we hit the club we 'bout to fuckin' go ham, y'all

My comrades want the bills, my comrades want them billions
My comrades want the tri's, my comrades want them trillions
Yeah we need more than racks, my comrades want them illions

Every time you hit the club, you always fuck it up

If you ever talk about me when I'm not around
Your girl'll probably tell me when I put it in her mouth
Put your wallet in your pocket, bitch you playing

Went from hipsters, now it's models and these singers(on the low)
And my hair be growing like a fuckin' Saiyan
I popped a couple pills, I think that I'm Devante
I fuck a bitch from Lost and Found like every Monday
My jaw line so defined, I'm wildin' like I'm Gunplay
You see no white inside my eyes and it's a fun day
But when I'm workin', girl, I'm workin' for the millions
Girl, when I'm workin', I be workin' for them millions
Why your hair down, I ain't trickin', find another sucka
These bitches tryna make a livin', but

You know I been on now, then, and I'm next
Every year my year, you know I always wanna flex

If you wanna go to the bar, drinks on us

Say my, say my, say my, say my name
Stwitchin' bitches and I'm switchin' lanes
When they call last shot for alcohol
I just wanna take my last drink
I just wanna sip some clean purple
Hit the car lot and just made a purchase
I just realized that I am a star
Cruisin' my coupe up the boulevard
None of my pictures are watermarked
Got more water than the waterboy
I be on it draped me up, nigga
Yellow bone suck my nuts, nigga
She think it's chocolate but she call me papi
Papi Chulo, I'ma get it poppin'
Got some red bottoms on a hotty thotty
Put them heels and them nipples in new Cavalli
I just came in like a kamikaze
I just walk 'round like a zombie, daddy
I don't like bein' in paddy wagons
So no remorse, I'm about the fetti
Had a few horses come by the telly
Eating each other, they get some credit
Got commas on commas, I'm really ready
I'm really 'bout to pour up on a jet
I would never mention niggas names
Tell niggas nigga never did exist
You niggas never ever been a threat
These niggas never get enough attention
I just put the bitch on punishment
I've been hangin' where the money been
I don't know what type of love is this
Can you tell me where my dogs at?
Put a hollow in your ball cap
What type of nigga you call that?
When I hang up on you, never call back
I'm a money counter, count my own money

Been proven you ain't ever goin' up
Every time you hit the club, you always fuck it up

The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you.",Time on My Hands
Mike Wofford,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head
Mike Wood,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Mikel Erentxun,"Mi amor te di en un viejo hotel
Las flores de mi corazón

Fue tu silencio nuestro adiós
Y al caer el sol la piel se separó
Y al caer el sol

Los años pasan sigo aquí
Sentado junto al surtidor
¡Qué grande es el colchón sin ti!
Y al caer el sol pienso solo en ti
Y al caer el sol

Mi amor al viento le pedí
Te traiga pronto junto a mí
No pierdo fácil la ilusión
Y al caer el sol vuelvo a estar sin ti
Y al caer el sol

Golpe certero
Rendido a tus pies
Y en un instante caer

Mikel Erentxun,"Armas de mujer
En noches de champagne
Hoy te puedo ver en la oscuridad
En la oscuridad te puedo ver

Ya son las diez
Tú te has ido y no sé qué
Desayunar si tú no estás
Me conformo con café
O con algo más

No sé por qué
Si no como al despertar
Me siento mal ya sabes que
De mañana es especial sin prisa

No hay nada en la televisión
No queda pan
Quizás un poco de champagne
Me haga reaccionar
Me haga controlar la situación

Horas muertas que se van
Estando a solas tú y yo
Con un poco de champagne

No sé qué hacer
En Madrid o San Sebastián
Si no estás tú será el champagne
Me recuerda aquella vez
Contigo en KU

Burbujas frescas del calor
De un buen cristal
Son noches secas de sabor
Las que tú me das
Las que tú me das sabor de amor

Armas de mujer
En noches de champagne
Hoy me beberé lo que tú me des
Lo que tú me des sorpréndeme

Sentir robar tu aliento
Es tu pasión es mi deseo
Amor sin ti soy cero

Solo tu letra muda y yo

Quiero inventar tu corazón

Reír llorar sin miedo
Color pintar un sueño
Los dos tumbados a ver quién pasa
Solo la luna se nos escapa

De tu armario una sonrisa en la mano
Descubre oculto el placer cotidiano

Mikel Erentxun,"Leo seda cuando miro tus manos
Y siento que es la primera palabra
Que aprendí a leer, que aprendí a creer

Tú me sedas a tu manera
Con un poco de mano izquierda
Y no me importa porque
No me importa porque

Encadéname y libérame
Acércate y luego aléjate
Enciéndeme apagándome
Y no guardes nada para después

Calles desiertas desiertos callados
Nunca hablo con las palabras
Cuando hablo de ti, cuando hablo de ti

Abrazo el aire que has abrazado
Nunca acierto con el momento
Cuando voy por ti, cuando voy por ti

Dame todo lo que me puedas dar
Dame todo lo que no debas dar
Encuéntrame luego piérdeme
Y castígame perdonándome

Encadéname y libérame
Acércate y luego aléjate
Enciéndeme apagándome

Mikel Erentxun,"La carretera nacional unía Madrid
Con Irún el caballo
Y la luz mil novecientos setenta y siete
Fue un año para olvidar pero vendrían más

Murió en Agosto el rey del rock and roll
La lengua partida en dos
Contábamos los coches
Que cruzaban el puente internacional

Camino de Francia o de Portugal
Súbeme a tu Volvo
Y llévame a cualquier lugar
Donde nada sea verdad

Nació dormida nuestra generación
Pero muy pronto despertó
Vivió deprisa en una competición
Que no podía ganar

Nadie tiene noticias de ti
No sé qué ha pasado con tu pasado
¿Te has vuelto a evaporar?
¿Y qué diferencia hay entre un mes
Un año o un día si tú no estás aquí?

Si estás inspirada escríbeme una carta
Aun soy un culo inquieto
No quiero dueños para mis sueños
Aun soy el mismo que se fue

Hay amigos de guardia que saben frenar
Las balas que tú no puedes parar

Amigos para reír
Y para compartir las tormentas
Que saben escuchar
Si no tienes nada más que decir

Que te recogen al caer
Y te ayudan a volar sin turbulencias
Y que están junto a ti

Mikel Erentxun,"Mikel Erentxun Carta de amor (cuando no hay amor) letra
Hoy te escribo esta carta porque siempre te quejabas de que nunca te enviaba cartas de amor.
Decías que era frío, que era todo indiferente y buscaste un continente para entregar tu calor.
Tal vez tu ONG se pueda ocupar de resucitar a hombres que siguen vivos.

Las cartas que no envías sólo son cartas marcadas, te regalan una mano pero nunca un corazón.
Mi casa está pidiendo una mano de pintura y algún punto de sutura para hacer punto final.
Y si estás en un país del Africa Central busca pronto un hechicero que me enseñe a olvidar.

Cartas de amor cuando ya no hay amor.
Cartas de amor, pero sin dirección.

Mi hospital de campaña, mi amuleto de la suerte, una firme barricada... lo eras todo para mí,
Pero hay cosas en la vida que son mucho más reales que los ojos que las miran.
Dime que fuí para ti. Dime que fuí para ti. Dime si en algún momento me llegaste a querer.

Mikel Erentxun,"Dejamos a alguien encargado
De parar el reloj y se olvido
El bar Penny Lane se llama
Ahora Coldplay efecto dos mil

Los éxitos del punk hoy
Son chill-out para dormir
Y los collares de perro
Son de Cartier o de Chanel

Buenos tiempos
Lo mejor de lo peor
Son las luces y sombras
De nuestra generación

Se dé un músico del glam
Que hoy toca en un hotel
De Benidorm nuestra sala
De conciertos ya no existe
Hoy es un fast food

Una radio pirata
Es un imperio real y legal
Y aquel poeta maldito
Ya no piensa en morir solo en ganar

Buenos tiempos
Lo mejor y lo peor
Son las luces y sombras
De nuestra generación

Todo cambia
Para bien o para mal

En el mapa ya no están
Paris ni Nueva York solo Japón

Eso ha sido mi corazón
Durante años de confusión
Me dejé robar me dejé engañar

No, no guardo rencor
No, no me guardo rencor
Ahora sale el sol
En mi canción de amor
Porque tú sigues junto a mí
Porque tú sigues

Todo se arregla con algo de fe
O con un lifting en el corazón
Antes se aprende a olvidar
Que a recordar, que a recordar

No, no importa quién fui
No, ni sé dónde fui pero
(Tú)
Eres el lugar, el único lugar
Al que yo quiero regresar
Al que yo quiero regresar

Mikel Erentxun,"Te abrazaba
En la curva anterior a las estrellas
Mientras les pedíamos cualquier deseo
Que tuviéramos prohibido pedir

Aun me veo
Subiendo al Everest de tu mirada
Donde el frio era siempre menos frio
Y el calor era la suma de los dos

Pero hay locuras que no tienen vuelta atrás
Y otras locuras que te hacen avanzar

Aun me duele
Si escucho el dolor de tu silencio
Si pienso que solo habrá un desierto
Que nos cuesta demasiado atravesar

He pensado
En todo lo que me queda por amarte
En todo lo que tú nunca sabrías
Si esta fuese mi última canción

Pero hay locuras que no tienen curación
Y otras locuras que te curan de una vez

Y siempre tú has sido mi orientación
La armadura de mi corazón
La locura que me dio la salvación
La locura que me da la salvación
La locura que me dará la salvación

Mikel Erentxun,"Un hombre duerme en el vagón
Al regresar de trabajar
Y unos chicos hablan sin parar
De lo que van a pillar

Una azafata de sainar
Se coloca su auricular
Y un cantante de Ecuador
Agradece la atención

Cuantas paradas hay que hacer
Para regresar a mi
Me perdí cuando me hallaste tú

Cuantos transbordos hay que hacer
Para regresar a mi
Me perdí al encontrarme tú

Un sin techo habla de Moscú
Mientras ojea el expansión
Se quita su sombrero de cowboy
Delante de aquel bombón

Se abren las puertas con la señal
Y se sube un nuevo chaval
Tiene cara de no saber
A dónde quiere llegar

Me recuerdas tanto a mi cuando era yo
Me recuerdas tanto a mi cuando era yo
Cuantas palabras hay que hacer para regresar a mi

Medio llena en tu casa
Y el resto de mi vida
En la consigna de la estación

He olvidado las preguntas
Que quedaron sin respuesta
Y mi copia de tus llaves
La he dejado en el buzón

El taxista hablaba sin descanso
De las obras de Madrid
Yo le contestaba a todo
""Que si que si que si""

Mientras tanto esperaba
Que mi móvil volviese a sonar
Que tu voz me susurrara
El Harvest de Nel Young

He descubierto que eres
Solo una moneda de tres caras
Y que nunca ganare contigo
Por muchas trampas que haga

Me enseñaste laberintos
En las citas con tu piel
Y me perdí en ellos
Sin saber porque ni para que

Ahora tengo mucha prisa
En llegar a ninguna parte
En viajar por tierra
A una isla alejada del mar

En alquilar un piso viejo
En un barrio que no exista
En doblar una esquina
Y que al doblarla no haya nada más

He dejado sólo una maleta
Medio llena en tu casa
Y el resto de mi vida
Sobre una cama sin hacer

He olvidado hace tiempo
La manera de olvidarte
He olvidado hace tiempo

Mikel Erentxun,"Tú me enseñaste a ver
Roma en el espejo
Y a quererlo atravesar

Tú me ayudaste a ver
En mi oscuridad
Una noche de sol

Hay una fuente cerrada
Por todos los deseos
Que se negaba a conceder

Y hay otra fuente aquí
Donde te desee
Al empezar a anochecer

Pensaré que la ciudad eterna
Tiene los días contados
Que cualquier cosa es más pequeña
Que todo nuestro amor

No, no quiero promesas
Tu solo dame un día
Y yo pondré otro día más

En búsqueda y captura
Y no tener que escapar

No sé cuanto empleare en volver

Sé que todo llega
Si quieres esperar
Todo sabe mejor
Si lo dejas enfriar

Hay cosas que no son
Lo que pueden parecer
El secreto está en saber mirar

El barro en los zapatos
Es otra cosa en realidad
Pequeños accidentes de andar sin mirar

Pero encontrarme contigo
Es el mejor final
Para un viaje que no debió empezar

Sé que todo llega
Cuando sabes esperar
Puedo viajar cien vidas
Sin llegarme a cansar

Cuando pase junto a ti
Asegúrate de que parara

Asegúrate
De que me quedare

Al llegar su día
Nunca se olvidan de regresar

Mis amigos se quedaron
Para siempre en un arcén
Discutiendo con la oscuridad
Sobre daltonismo y velocidad

¿De que intentaban escapar esa noche?
¿De quién querían escapar
Con la luna de detrás?

Ellos me suelen evitar
El resto de los días

A veces se presentan sin avisar
Y me sonríen desde los posos del te
No sé a qué abismo intentaban escapar
Con el mundo detrás

I would never, never hurt you",Hurt
Mikey Wax,"Well I was walking alone
Down those city roads
When a man asked me
“May I please have some gold?”
So I reached within
I gave him all that I could loan
And he said ""in my return
I'll play you the last great song""

And so he reached for his guitar
He put the notes in proper tone
And before he began he said
""There’s something you should know
Now the words they aren't done
And I probably sing it wrong
But if you look beyond the flaws
You will hear the last great song""

And the man began to play
And the melody would grow
To the mountains high
From those valleys below
And as it came to an end
He held the last note long
And then he said ""My friend
You've just heard the last great song""

He said ""I'd love for you to stay
But I'm sure you've got to go
But whatever song you play
Make sure that all the people know
That the words they're never done
And you'll probably sing it wrong
But if they look beyond the flaws 
They will hear the last great song""

And his voice stayed in my head
And his melody would grow
To the mountains high
From those valleys below
And as it came to an end
He held the last note long
And then he said ""my friend
You've just heard the last great song""

And so I walked on my way
Walked about a block or two
When someone must have paid
Cause’ I swear I heard the tune
Of a sound so sweet
Of a sky so blue
And he played it complete 
‘Til everybody knew

And the man sang loud
And it echoed through the dark
From 14th street
Through all of Central Park
And as it came to an end
He held the last note long
And then he said ""My friend
You've just heard the last great song""

The last great song
The last great song
And then he said ""my friend
You've just heard the last great song""",Last Great Song
Mikey Wax,"It's hard to imagine your life without love right now
Where could it go?
And all of the words that you feel creeping up inside
Are now in control
Say what you want on your own time
But remember
And do as you will with your own life
But remember

Don't let the sun into your eyes
Oh love, come and take me away with your lies

Your shelter keeps me home
Your love light you turn me on
Your shelter is my home
And I don't think I'm walking away

So float like a feather you know that love makes you high
And keeps you alive
But how will you swim with your heart sinking like a stone
Under the tide
Dream like you do in a movie
Cause you're the star
You know she's a talented beauty
She will steal your heart

Don't let the sun into your eyes
Oh love, come and take me away with your lies

Your shelter keeps me home
Your love light you turn me on
Your shelter is my home
And I don't think I'm walking away
Your shelter keeps me home
Your love light you turn me on
Your shelter is my home
And I don't think I'm walking away",Love Light (Triad)

Add one stolen night of bliss 
One girl, one boy, some grief, some joy

Don't forget a small moonbeam 
Fold it lightly with a dream

Then at the wedding bells 
One house where lovers dwell 
Three little kids for the flavor 
Stir carefully through the day 
See how the flavor stays

Cause while I stayed at home someone else took you out
I cried cause I love you with all of my might
And I missed me how I missed me at your house last night
I missed holding hands walking out on your lawn
I missed the sweet kiss that was mine for so long
Were you happy with new arms wrapped around you so tight
I missed me how I missed me at your house last night

Did the neighbors say they noticed anything strange
Like a different car parked in your drive for a change
Did they watch as he kissed you beneath the porch light
Did they miss me like I missed me at your house last night

I won't be afraid anymore, my heart will lead the way

You are the light that's shining through
You're all the warmth I never knew

If we just do what's right, the truth will not fail
I won't give up the fight
Not until you are out of  harm's way
(Come, hold me in your arms today)
I'll do anything for you, my heart will tell me to

You are the light that's shining through
You're all the warmth I never knew
Don't know how far I would go or what I'd do to
Touch the light that's shining through
Shine your light on the darkness, love will follow you

Miki Howard,"I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired.
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth.
And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say come dance with me
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems
At seventeen.
A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, Pity please the ones who serve
They only get what they deserve.
The rich relationed hometown queen
Married into what she needs
A guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly.
Remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
Indebentures of quality
And dubious integrity.
Their small town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received
At seventeen.
To those of us who know the pain
Of valentines that never came,
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball.
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
And dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me.
We all play the game and when we dare
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
That call and say, come dance with me
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me
At seventeen.",At Seventeen

And if you call my name, then I can see up

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

I don't need to buy a pack
I quit ten days ago
I don't need to hit the town

I don't need to call you up
To see if you're at home
I don't need to drive by your house
To see if you're alone

I'll start wanting you again
'Cause I can't stop the way I feel
You won't even have the heart
To say our love was real
But tonight I know I will

I don't need to lose my pride
Knocking on your door
I don't need to hear you say
You don't love me no more
Don't want to shed a tear
Like I'm prone to do
Don't want to stay up all night
If I'm not next to you

But tonight I know I will
I'll start wanting you again
'Cause I can't stop the way I feel
You won't even have the heart
To say our love was real

Down memory lane

Where nothing's ever gonna change

I'll start wanting you again

You won't even have the heart

There's clearly something wrong, there's clearly something wrong with you
I really do not mean to pry but this just seems so silly
How can the truth become a lie just so it means you're winning, oh

I can see it in your eyes 
You can't shy away
Or cover up your misdemeanours with anything you say

When you want you know you can be as good as gold
But try telling that to the bloke who owns the phone that you just stole
I try to say your doing wrong but you choose to ignore me 
You say you don't need anyone but I know a different story, oh

I can see it in your eyes 
You can't shy away
Or cover up your misdemeanours With anything you say

I can see it in your eyes 
You can't shy away
Or cover up your misdemeanours and it's not your fault, you say

Cause if no one got hurt what's all the fuss about, you say

Can you fetch my coat?
'Cause I don't feel too great anymore
But I want to stay
Don't you want to stay as well?

I don't think that you do
I've got this funny feeling
That you don't feel like I do
This conversation's just passing you by
I know it, I can see it in your eyes

You've had one too many, low and behold
You're telling the secrets that can't be told
It feels so special, it feels so right
But then you knock me back and I fall
I fall to the floor

And all he wanted was a kiss
All he wanted was a chance tonight

I'm walking home, I'm pissed and I'm frozen
My minds being warmed up
By that little token of you
In your little way
But they're sleeping in your today

And now beeps the phone
I fumble round to answer
But I end up with it on hold
Late night taxis keep passing me by
I feel sick and look to the sky

I've had one too many, low and behold
The late night lovers stay out in the cold
I ring your number and feel so bold
You kick me into touch and I fall to the floor

And all he wanted was a kiss
All he wanted was a chance tonight

And yeah, your ignorance was bliss
Your ignorance was paradise
Just give him a chance
Just give him a sign or something
Tell him what you want

'Cause before too long he'll find somebody else
It's then that you'll know you want him more
You call his name and he doesn't respond
He knocks you back and you fall

Or a waiting list
You're not just a number upon a computer

I'm sorry if I caught your eye
What is she wearing? That's a bit daring
Oh, please put away those thunderous thighs

Do you see what I see?
He's looking straight at me as if I've done something wrong
And I looked at his missus, high heels, pink lipstick
I won't be for very long, oh, I won't be for very long

But I'm alright, they all cried as they stumble down the stairs
I'm just fine, got no inhibitions, no rhythm, worries or cares
And you're unstoppable now, moving on the dance floor
You're unstoppable the world is at your feet if only for tonight

I was just passing you dancing, you asked me to walk to the floor
Where are we going? Stop tooing and frowning
Don't ask me 'cause I don't know, you tried to control her

I can't control her, mascara runs down her cheek
Call 'em a bastards, oh when plastered
They'll be back together next week, by the end of next week

But I'm alright, they all cried as they stumble down the stairs
I'm just fine, got no inhibitions, no rhythm, worries or cares
And you're unstoppable now, moving on the dance floor
You're unstoppable the world is at your feet if only for tonight

Ooh no, when they've had too much
Everybody wants her, everybody wants him
Oh, just a faintest touch
The bouncers shout to the screams on top of the bar
And the crowd disappears as the police arrive
And throw the thugs in the back of the car

Yeah, it all comes part of the package
Front row viewing at no extra cost
Just fill 'em up with the barrel
Now you've lit the fuse so watch the fireworks go of

So take my hand and let's go roamin'through the heather on the hill.
The mornin' dew is blinkin' yonder,there's lazy music in the rill,
And all I want to do is wander through the heather on the hill.
There may be other days as rich and rare,
There may be other springs as full and fare,
But the won't be the same, they'll come and go

Mildred Bailey,"Just picture a penthouse way up in the sky
With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,

These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Mildred Bailey,"We meet and the angels sing
The angels sing the sweetest song I ever heard
You speak and the angels sing
Or am I breathing music into every word?

Suddenly, the setting is strange
I can see water and moonlight beaming
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore

Then, suddenly, I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore

You smile and the angels sing
And though it's just a gentle murmur at the start
We kiss and the angels sing
And leave their music ringing in my heart

Mildred Bailey,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

You say you love me and you hold me tight

Then I tumble out of paradise

Darn that one-track mind of mine

Just to change the mood I'm in

Mildred Bailey,"Carolina 
Gave me Dinah; 
I'm the proudest one 
Beneath the Dixie sun. 

News is spreadin' 
'Bout our weddin'; 
I hear church bells ringin', 
Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Shake their shoulders bold.
You're bound to fall for the bugle call;

Mildred Bailey,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",He's Funny That Way

But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,

I could live without love

Mildred Bailey,"They ask me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course reply
Something inside

They said some day you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them
And I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt
To think they could doubt my love
But today
My love has flown away
I am without my love
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
When a lovely flame dies

Miles Davis,"I go through the strangest kind of changes
Tryin' to find myself a way to pay my dues
And would you believe it I'm so urban
My suburban friends don't know my bag of blues
I'm up in the morning on the corner so siditty

That you'd hardly know it's me
And late in the evening when I'm mellow
There's my fellow with the world for me to see
It's a world full of cocktails at nine
And dinners and wine very late shows
And where the crowd goes

I'm a girl with a world of her owna queen on her throne
Till everything's gone and then
I wake up to find that I'm a stranger
In a world where I have never before
I look for my man who held my hand

But now I know that he'll be coming back no more
I'm telling you 'bout this bag of blues
Paid a whole lotta dues baby
Gonna change my way of livin' talkin' bags of blues
Mister don't you see I'm paying dues
Gonna change me some shoes baby

Walkin' in a daze to my apartment where I'll grab another wink
And doze on the sofa 'til eleven then get up and pour myself another drink
While back at the party I'll be hardy while I'm waitin' for some better news
But now in the meantime I'll just sit right here and cool it
We're gonna cool it now and listen to the rhythm

Like the ocean beats upon the sand

You gotta heart full of complacency too

I got a lack girl that you'd love to be

want to do damage that you can undo
Apart from everyone away from your love
A part of me belongs apart from all the hurt above

I got a perfect way to make a justification
I got a perfect way to make a certain a maybe

I took a page out of my rulebook for you
You want to message a confession you want to martyr me too
You want to margin of error for two
Maybe tomorrow the next letter or when the weather gets better
I've got to wait here for your moon to turn blue
I made an offer an exception I made a sense out of you
You took a good look at your book but I knew
In times of tenderness in terms baby so true
Until such time as I can understand all the things you do
Want to forgive you for all the things that you do
want to forget how to remember with you

Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you

Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning

Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two

We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me

And blame all your charms that melt in my arms

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

For I haven't met a gent so magnificent or elegant as my old flame

I've met so many who had fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes, some who took me up to the skies
But their attempts at love were only imitations of my old flame

Cat tops spin across the highway and horses die in backseats

Any way I look at him my love, you've got to come back soon it's not fair

Let me prove that it adores

Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt

My legs are yelling ""Whoa""
But we're in such a groove
And love is still advancing

Nothing to do, but waltz

You can't suggest that we could go on jitterbugging
No bugging

We've nothing left for moves more strenuous than hugging
Just hugging

But we don't need much room to gently cut-a-rug in, we two

We're dead on our feet
And the sauce is repeatin'

I think I'd like to stay,
Till we're the only couple

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Just give me a June night
The moonlight and you
Gotta have you, under the moon
Give me a June night",June Night
Miles Davis,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Miles Davis,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me.","Oh, Lady Be Good"
Miles Davis,"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known,
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you",There Is No Greater Love
Miles Davis,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon",How High the Moon
Miles Davis,"Why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to nine
Bring all of your fam'ly and I will bring mine
If I should bring my brothers, and you bring the others
Then I can sing a song like Jeru, just for you

Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
just for me too

Gather around, tale to be told
Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others, just me and just you
And while we're versifying
We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me
Just for you, one more Jeru",Jeru
Miles Davis,"Uh-look-ah there
There she comes
Here comes that girl again
Wanted to date her since I don't know when 
But she don't notice me when I pass
She goes with older guys from out of my class
But that can't stop me from-ah thinkin' to myself 
She's sure fine lookin' man
She's somethin' else

Hey look-ah there
Across the street
There's a car made just for me
To own that car would be a luxury
But right now I can't afford the gas
A brand new convertible is out of my class
But that can't stop me from-ah thinkin' to myself 
That car's fine lookin' man
It's somethin' else

Hey look-ah here
Just wait and see
Workin' hard and savin' my dough
I'll buy that car that I've be wanting so 
Get me that girl and we'll go ridin' around
The town will be all shocked with my white top down
I'll keep right on and dreamin' and-ah thinkin' to myself 
When it all comes true, man
Wow! That's somethin' else

Look-ah here
What's all this?
Never thought I'd do this before
But here I am ah-knockin' on her door 
My car's out front and it's all mine 
Just a '41 Ford not a '59
I got that girl and I'm-ah thinkin' to myself 
She's sure fine lookin' man
Wow! She's somethin' else",Somethin' Else
Miles Davis,"Time after time I tell myself that I'm
So lucky to be loving you
So lucky to be 
The one you run to see
In the evening when the day is through

I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young, so new
And time after time
You'll hear me say that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young, so new
And time after time
You'll hear me say that I'm
So lucky to be loving you",Time After Time
Miles Davis,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you are the lover I have waited for
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love",That Old Black Magic
Miles Davis,"Some sunny day, baby 
When everything seems OK, baby 
You'll wake up and find that you're alone 
'Cause I'll be gone 
Gone, gone, gone, really gone, gone, gone, gone 
'Cause you done me wrong 

Everyone that you meet, baby 
As you walk down the street, baby 
Will ask you why you're walkin' all alone 
Why you're on your own 
Just say I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, really gone 
'Cause you done me wrong 

If you change your ways, baby 
You might get me to stay, baby 
You better hurry up if you don't wanna be alone 
'Cause I'll be gone 
Gone, gone, gone, really gone, gone, gone, gone 
'Cause you done me wrong",Gone [Master]
Miles Davis,"Everyone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Someday there'll be no more Old Folks
What a lonesome old town this will be
Children's voice at play, will be still for a day
The day they take the Old Folks away",Old Folks
Miles Davis,"What is the musical topic, of the day?
Bebop so the critic's say, well that was OK!
Who were the originators, do you know?
Yardbird and Dizzy tell me, I think its quite so

Now I'm just holding thumbs like, Toscaninni and La Cost
Well, as long as I'm hip to it, I think I'm hipper to the how,
Explain it to the folks

Bebop my friends was just a whole lotta fun!
You could take any old riff, and make a real long run.",Feio [#]
Miles Davis,"In a Sentimental Mood I can see
The stars come through my room
While your loving attitude is
Like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make
My Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
My heart's lighter thing since you
Made me this night a thing divine
In A Sentimental Mood
I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt that you'd be
Loving sentimental me
In A Sentimental Mood I can see
The stars come through my room
While your loving attitude is
Like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make
My Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
My heart's lighter thing since you
Made me this night a thing divine
In A Sentimental Mood
I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt that you'd be
Loving sentimental me",In a Sentimental Mood
Miles Davis,"I reach for you like I'd reach for a star
Worshipping you from afar
Living with my silent love

I'm like a flame dying out in the rain
Only the ashes remain
Smould'ring like my silent love

How I long to tell
All the things I have planned
Still, it's wrong to tell
You would not understand

You'll go along, never dreaming I care
Loving somebody, somewhere
Leaving me my silent love

You'll go along, never dreaming I care
Loving somebody, somewhere
Leaving me my silent love",My Silent Love
