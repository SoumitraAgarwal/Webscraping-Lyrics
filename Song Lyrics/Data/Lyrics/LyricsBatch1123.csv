Robin Schulz,"Under the moonlit sky, we see the forces die 
Oh, ashes falling, oh, while it's falling 
Under the moonlit sky, oh how you fall and die? 
So long now, so long now

Under the moonlit sky, the stars fall and die
How the sea rages, oh love bruises
It’s like the world you’ve known before it’s lost and gone
Unlike a world you’ve seen before it’s lost to me

Under the moonlit sky, just hold my hand and try
Hold me soft tonight beneath the quiet lights
Under the moonlit sky, I’ll hold your hand of lies
But in my arm’s colder, oh lost soldier

Under the moonlit sky, we see the forces die
Oh, ashes falling, oh, while it's falling
Under the moonlit sky, oh how you fall and die?
So long now, so long now

Under the moonlit sky, we see the forces die
Oh, ashes falling, oh, while it's falling
Under the moonlit sky, oh how you fall and die?
So long now, so long now

So long now, so long now
So long now, so long now
So long now, so long now
So long now, so long now",Moonlit Sky
Robin Schulz,"You've got kisses sweeter than honey
And I work 7 days a week to give you all my money

Robin Schulz,"I wanna close the curtains
‘Cause all we need is candlelight
You and me and a bottle of wine
To hold you tonight
Well, we know I’m going away
And I wish, I wish it weren’t so
So take this wine and drink with me
Let’s delay our misery

Save tonight, fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow, I’ll be gone
Save tonight, fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow, I’ll be gone
Tomorrow, I’ll be gone
Tomorrow, I’ll be gone

There’s a log on the fire
And it burns like me for you
Tomorrow comes with no desire
To take me away, it’s true
It ain’t easy to say goodbye
Darling, please don’t start to cry
Cause boy, you know I’ve got to go
Oh, and Lord, I wish it wasn’t so

Save tonight, fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow, I’ll be gone
Save tonight, fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow, I’ll be gone
Save tonight, fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow, I’ll be gone
Save, save, save, save
Save tonight, save tonight, save tonight, save tonight
And tomorrow comes to take me away
I wish that I, I wish that I could stay
But boy, you know I’ve got to go
And Lord, I wish it wasn’t so

Robin Schulz,"There’s a notebook on the table
You can take it to the store
So you won’t forget the groceries anymore
There’s a rifle in the cabinet that I used to fight a war
But to this day, I don’t know what I wass fighting for
I’m fighting for

Will you show me love as we get older
And I’m falling at your feet
After thirty years of service and one to fit our need
Show me love as we grow colder
Let our love provide the heat
But our older bones are missing
But our heart’s will never meet

There’s a blanket on the sofa that I used to keep you warm
When I find you fast asleep at half past four
There’s a record we keep turning that reminds us of our youth
But there’s still nothing as beautiful as you

Will you show me love as we get older
And I’m falling at your feet
After thirty years of service and one to fit our need
Show me love as we grow colder
Let our love provide the heat
But our older bones are missing
But our heart’s will never meet

As we grow colder
Love provide the heat
Older bones are missing
Heart’s will never meet

Because your hand
Belongs in my hand
Belongs in your hand
Belongs with, with me

(Blanket on the sofa that I used to keep you warm
There’s a record we keep turning that I used to turn you on)

Will you show me love as we get older
And I’m falling at your feet
After thirty years of service and one to fit our need
Show me love as we grow colder
Let our love provide the heat
But our older bones are missing
But our heart’s will never meet",Show Me Love
Robin Schulz,"This is your life
And this is your life and this is your love
And this is a time we’re gonna rise above
There’s no place like home
That place in your soul
That’s where we begun and where we all will go

Churn your heartstrings 'til the bell rings
Take it all in, everything you got to see
Shake it all out, break it all down
Scream it out from rooftops all around the world

And this is your life and this is your love

But none of it worth for days
Said you would love me always
But we haven’t kissed for four days

I used to say, yeah, I used to say
We’ll make it work, we’ll make it work

Robin Schulz,"Yesterday, when I was almost home
There were people standing right outside my door
And my lady was lying on the floor, on the floor

Yeah, not a single word had come out of my mouth
I just stepped outside and I headed south
Me and my old shoes and this old fashioned blues
That I sent for you

I turned my back and I walked into the night
No looking back to whatever I left behind
I didn’t wave goodbye, I didn’t even wave goodbye
I turned my back and I walked a million miles
Under the burning sun and the blinding light
I didn’t wave goodbye, I didn’t even wave goodbye

I grabbed my stuff, it was really tough
I slipped out and didn’t even close the door
Nothing left to close the door for

Yeah, not a single word had come out of my mouth
I just stepped outside and I headed south
Me and my old shoes and this old fashioned blues
That I sent for you

I turned my back and I walked into the night
No looking back to whatever I left behind
I didn’t wave goodbye, I didn’t even wave goodbye
I turned my back and I walked a million miles
Under the burning sun and the blinding light
I didn’t wave goodbye, I didn’t even wave goodbye",Wave Goodbye
Robin Schulz,"When everything isn't yellow

Robin Schulz,"She got cherry lips
Angel eyes
She knows exactly how to tantalize
She's out to get you, danger by design
Cold blooded vixen, she don't compromise
She's optimistic of the coded lights
So far from typical, but take my advice
Before you play with fire, do think twice
And if you get burned, don't be surprised

Got me tripping higher than the ceiling
Ooh baby it's the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted feeling so gifted

Robin Shier,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?",Skylark
Robin Spielberg,"There's a time each year
That we always hold dear
Good old summertime
With the birds and the trees'es
And sweet scented breezes
Good old summertime
When your day's work is over
Then you are in clover
And life is one beautiful rhyme
No trouble annoying
Each one is enjoying
The good old summertime

In the good old summertime
In the good old summertime
Strolling through a shady lane
With your baby mine
You hold her hand and she holds yours
And that's a very good sign
That she's your tootsey-wootsey
In the good, old summertime

Oh, to swim in the pool
You'd play hooky from school
Good old summertime
You'd play ""ring-a-rosie""
With Jim, Kate and Josie
Good old summertime
Those days full of pleasure
We now fondly treasure
When we never thought it a crime
To go stealing cherries
With faces brown as berries
In good old summertime

In the good old summertime
In the good old summertime
Strolling through a shady lane
With your baby mine
You hold her hand and she holds yours
And that's a very good sign
That she's your tootsey-wootsey
In the good, old summertime",In The Good Old Summertime
Robin Spielberg,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Robin Spielberg,"On every tree there sits a bird, singing a song of love
On every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard 
Could break my heart without a word singing a song of love
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
 
A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know

Robin Spielberg,"Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

Sometimes the very thing you're looking for

Robin Spielberg,"When I wake up each morning 
Trying to find myself
And if I'm ever the least unsure
I always remind myself
Though you're someone in this world 
That I'll always choose to love
From now on 
You're only someone that I used to love

As for me it's getting down to the last unspoken part
When you must begin to ease the pain of a broken heart
Tell me why should I even care
If I have to lose your love
From now on
You're only someone that I used to love

Yet it wasn't enough for you
All the love I had to give
I did my best to keep you satisfied
I guess you'll never know how much I tried
I really tried

And if ever our paths should cross again
Well, You won't find me being the one 
Who gets lost
Once I had so much to give
But You just refused my love
From now on
You're only someone that I used to love

I did my best to keep you satisfied

Winks that I won't do her best

Some like to keep heat on
Some never hot enough
See I sleep with nothing on
'cause I'm always burnin' up
But we all want to try
To see each other's side
And I'll try
Til she takes my pillow

Mm
She'll say I'm lucky
She'll say I'm the man
We'll talk on for hours
As long as I understand
I'd go on without her
See see
But everyday
Ain't the same
Ain't the same
Ain't the same
I feel like a puppy
When I get time to play

I've got a brand new Jones
And nobody even knows
When my baby is gone
It's my thang, my thang
Sometimes I can't let go
So I've got to be alone
When my baby is gone
It's my thang, my thang alone

Some like a sweet romance
And some want to travel far
But I like a three point stance
And I hate to drive my car
But I'd go round the world
Just to please my girl
And I'll fly
If she takes my pillow

Oh
She'll say I'm lucky
Then say I'm the man
We'll talk on for hours
As long as I understand
I'd go on without her
But everyday
I feel like a puppy
When I get time to play

I've got a brand new Jones
And nobody even knows
When my baby is gone
It's my thang, yeah, my thang
Sometimes I can't let go
So I've got to be alone
When my baby is gone
It's my thang my thang alone

So why don't I just
Save time and reveal now
'cause sooner or later she'll
Know the deal
She'll wonder why
The bed jumps so high
When she sleeps at night
Oh yeah yeah

Oh
Tells me I'm lucky
Then say I'm the man
We'll talk on for hours
As long as I understand
I'd go on without it
See see
But everyday
I.. no...
Ain't the same
Ain't the same
I feel like a puppy
When I get time to play

I've got a brand new Jones
And nobody even knows
When my baby is gone
It's my thang, my thang
Sometimes I can't let go
So I've got to be alone
When my baby is gone
It's my thang my thang alone

I've got this brand new Jones
Leave me on my own

She took away her sweet love when she died
And all of the flowers have been put into the garage

Though I made her seem lucky in my arms
I promised her love

She keeps on knocking but she can't get in
And though I promised her love
She keeps on knocking but she can't get in
And though I promised her love

Over and over and over again

I had my car stolen
Now my radios gone
I had this fine woman
I couldn't get none
It seems like the world is up against me
For something I've done
I still got my mind, still got my music baby
I'm a be alright 
I'm a be alright

All of my bills are pilin' cause I spent what I owe
I wasn't invited to any parties, so I'm throwing my own
Can't get a job cause I ain't been lookin' for one

I'm taking time out for reflecting
I'm going one on one with who I'd like to be
And I'm leaning towards the sun
Watching flowers blossom
All around me

I tried wailin' to a wall
Standin' like porcelain, mumblin',
Salt water rollin' down side burns,
Searchin' for the answers, handling the truth
Seein' it for myself is the only way
Forget a winner, stop being a sinner first
Ruining your liver, smoking cigarettes and worse
Love is a killer, the leading cause of suicide
How to survive a day in the life of times

[Chorus]
I'll rock the vote not to hear you
Tell me that I'm watching too much TV
Then I'll hope that I can win with the lazy bones I'm livin' in
It's not my fault I wasn't chosen
I was focused in the open
I deserve so much better than this

I'm shooting airballs from the free-throw line
I'm batting lefty when I know that I'm alright
I'm reaching out for the sun
Being passed by shooting stars overnight

I been livin' with a small inner child
Antsy, I can't sit still for a minute
My shortage of concentration ruins meditation
And my motivation ain't shit
I need a way
My tolerance ain't what it used to be
Dollars make sense sellin' out for a fee
If I didn't have faith, could you still save me?
How to survive the lines we hate to lead

[Chorus]

Fuck the future
I'm in the present plague
Can't be a loser, my girl won't stay
I don't know computers, I was sick that day
How to survive the mines we chose to lay

Alright...

Dinners and parties to fill up the week

I want to jump into the tree house

Is we got to get together
Got to get together to write it

Diamonds and peacocks lining the street
I'm talking to strangers and they're talking to me
I'm scraping the crystals out of the sac
Life is a yo-yo and family's a drag, i know
But what I'm sure of is what i want to be

Got a call from my boss Mr. Andre Harrell
Don't need me for the weekend
To do what the hell
I packed up the ride and jumped on the cell
I'm callin up my friends

'65 Rivi with the dice in the mirror
Rollin down the coast, the cops on the rear
Goin where the ladies want Tequila & Beer
I'm lookin at the Mami
And where she goes I'm following

Chorus: Bailes why singe conmigo
Quiero que te vengas conmigo amor
Quiero que tu bailes why SIGUE conmigo
Quiero que te vengas conmigo amor
Anywhere we go

We talk and we touch, ooh
I like her so much
A walk on the beach and all the way home
She shows me to her room

Time is flyin till her brother arrives
He's throwin sneakers at my head
And the CDs are flyin
I jumped out the window, left my clothing behind
She never said her name
But where she goes I'm wondering

She's the kind of girl you wanna marry
The kind of girl you'd walk the whole world for
Put her on your back and just carry
Her attitude is hotter than the earth's core
When she's around nothing else matters
Untouchable, she's got her own forcefield
Sooner or later someone will get at her
If I don't someone else will

Scientists say that she's the second sunshine
And now my life is sweeter than berries

If I turn my back then someone will get at her

Picture my life and my intention to ball
Picture this ice and how it glitter for y'all
Now don't you feel claustrophobic when that chick is involved?
She changed your life - and your frame of mind
Sorry I hope what I'm saying is fine
We fuss but we take it one day at a time
If there's a fire you know that she'll lay in the line
I just, close my eyes and curve my mouth
Open my mind and words come out
You're eclectic, you're creative
You the picture girl I just painted
I got it, you name it, it's all paid for
Big castle on the sea shore, with the Willy Wonka decor

Yeah, hey, mama
Kick time at the bed, I'm coming over
Got something to show you
Behold your ass
I's wanna hold you, just hold you tight
Like a four-leaf clover, I be goin' through 
Your flowers, baby, your garden's open
A sight for sore eyes
Good lord, I'm focused
'Cause I can hardly notice anything other 
Than the woman with the face of my future baby mother 

I'm a big man, she's a big girl
Put on them heels, put on that skirt
She wants to get naughty; we can get bad
She's a good girl with the good girl dance
I'm ice cream, she's a hot swirl
We can get married and live in our world
Let's play rough; we can get wild
I could go home, but I'll stay
Cheat but I won't

So I go by Weezy 
Love me or leave me
I hate to leave her
I think I need her
She's such a teaser
Such a diva
I could park right here, baby; fuck the meter
Do it to me, baby, I could be your receiver
Call me in the last minute, I could be your reliever
Call me at the last minute, I be that evenin'
Late night, early morning, maybe this evenin'

I wanna get mad, but then not really
She's so fly; I could get mine
But I do it much better with her by my side

And watch the sunrise in your face
All night long I wait for you to play

I drink too, saw you when I came through
Now I can't do nothin' if it ain't you

Two times for the ladies in the tight jeans
Three times for the ladies who ain't got no panties on

Robin Thicke,"Nothing can make you high
Or put fire in your eyes
Or give you a chance to fly
When you need the wings
When all that you've got is doubt
And nothing can stop you from feeling down
But, oh, I know
I know exactly how you feel

But can you believe now
When you're on your knees now
Begging and pleading now?
Can you believe
When all that you've got is doubt
And no one to pull you out
When your heart is slowin' down?
Can you believe?

See, the person I love the most
Is so far away tonight
And no other medicine or promise is
Gonna heal me up right
But I got to believe
That her and me
Will be together
'Cause that's all I got
And, oh, I know
When you're down at the bottom
Can you believe?

Can you believe now
When you're on your knees now
Begging and pleading now?
Can you believe
When all that you've got is doubt
And no one to pull you out
When your heart is slowin' down?
Can you believe?

Can you believe when all hope seems gone
When your mother and father can't keep you safe from harm?
Can you forgive in your heart?
Can you ask for forgiveness?
When nobody else believes, can you believe?
Can you believe in yourself?

Can you believe
When all that you've got is doubt
And no one to pull you out
When your heart is slowin' down?
Can you believe?

If nobody's watchin'
You will never know

Up in the sky and now they're never ever home
They started fighting, then it got silent

You need my love, you need my hand

And all I want to do is see you
All I want to do is please you
I'm hypnotized by everything you do
I hope I'm just right for you

And baby I know you're the only one for me.
And its right there on your lips.
And its right there in your kiss.
And baby I know, you're the only air I breathe.
And and its right there on your lips.
And its right there in your kiss.

Just right

I take you here, I take you there.
I take your body anywhere.
Baby I work so hard for you,
To make your fantasy come true.

I got your front, I got your back.
We'll take it slow, we'll make it last.

A little bit naughty, a little bit nice.
Tell me baby that you need me too.

Would you mind if I hang around

She say she love me, I’m convinced
Don’t need a rocket scientist to see that you and I are meant
I meant to tell you, you the reason I smile more
Who I fell for, you know I beat that, beat that up Rocky Balboa

Girl I’m just playing unless you ain't
And I can’t think
If there ain’t a thought about you
Matter of fact that’s all I do
I put you first, now tell me that we’ll never be apart
Now I say, please girl don’t you go breaking my pretty little heart

Tell me something sweet
Tell me something nice
Tell me something good
Baby, tell me it’s alright

Tell me that you love me
Tell me you’ll be there
I get so worried, sometimes
The world will not be there
Tell me that I’m sexy
Like I was before

Tell me I got it
That you want it even more
Tell me that you’ll never, ever
Ever leave me side, side
Tell me cause you know
I need to hear it every night

Baby you got me, don’t worry your pretty little heart
I said
Baby you got me, don’t worry your pretty little heart

Tell me who you with
Tell me where you work
Tell me did you go out
And start talking to some girl
I want to believe it
You know how hard I try
After all we’ve been through
It’s so hard to say goodbye

Tell me that the future is getting brighter now
Tell me that we’ll make it
That we’ll make it somehow
Tell me it’s forever
That we’ll never burn
Tell me that you’ll never break my pretty little heart

Baby you got me, don’t worry your pretty little heart
And I said,
Baby you got me, don’t worry your pretty little heart

Tell me that’s the money
Tell me I’m a star
Tell me that you’ll never break my pretty little heart
Say you’ll take me places
Everything’s okay
Tell me cause you know I need that pump up everyday
Tell me that’s your money
Won’t get in our way
Tell me that the chance I take, won’t blow up in my face
Tell me that you’ll do it
That you’ll do it real
I’ll leave you if you break my pretty little heart, I will

 And you made me feel like I was flying
 When I made you sparkle in your eyes
 We ain't even 20 baby
 I ain't learned to love you right, yeah
 Umm, good thing I thought I was the shit back then
 I sang in your ear cause I wanted you to know
 That I had soul baby
 I called you all the time
 I guess I tried too hard to make you mine
 You'd have nothing to do with me baby
 Thank God that you changed, oh
 
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
 For the rest of my life you know I wanna be here
 For the rest of my life for you I'm gonna be strong
 Baby will you stay?
 Baby will you stay?
 Baby will you stay?
 Baby will you stay mine?
 
Finally convinced you to come over and just say hi
 I sang forever my lady and kissed you for the very first time
 After months, holidays, holding hands in the park
 Normally I'd just play basketball or something in the park
 And I messed up like boys tend to do
 It'd be a year till I got back with you
 Thank God that you called me back baby
 Cause I'd never be the man that I am today
 
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours

 For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours

 Baby will you stay?
 Baby will you stay mine?

 You said you were at home alone
 I wasn't even old enough to drive
 I saw my only chance just to keep it alive
 Keep love alive
 Good thing for you I stole my daddy's car
 Cause no one's gonna ever love you better
 Better than I do, yes I do
 
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours

One thing I ask of you
Lemme be the one you bring that ass up to
From Malibu to Paris, boo
Had a bitch, but she ain't bad as you
So, hit me up when you passin' through
I'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two
Swag on 'em even when you dress casual
I mean, it's almost unbearable
Honey you not there when I'm
At the bar side let you have me by
Nothin' like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair for you
So I'm just watchin' and waitin'
For you to salute the truly pimpin'
Not many women can refuse this pimpin'
I'm a nice guy, but don't get confused, you git'n it!

Shake your rump
Get down
Get up
Do it like it hurt, like it hurt
What, you don't like work?
Hey!

Baby, can you breathe?

It always works for me
Dakota to Decatur

Cause now your winning

You're just saying imagine if we friend
Dangerous through my pursuit of happiness
Trouble is 'bout to get me in the end

But your fancy shoes and handbag

She's only nice when something is at stake
And speaking for her friends there is a castuas

'Cause there ain't no hat for that

Stopping short of offering your house
Stranger to the simplest of pleasure
Distance is to you a work of art

The lights from above seemed to shine on only you
And you made me feel like I was flying
When I made you sparkle in your eyes
We ain't even 20 baby
I ain't learned to love you right, yeah
Umm, good thing I thought I was the shit back then
I sang in your ear 'cause I wanted you to know
That I had soul baby
I called you all the time
I guess I tried too hard to make you mine
You'd have nothing to do with me baby
Thank God that you changed your mind

For the rest of my life you know I'm gonna be yours
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life for you I'm gonna be strong
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay mine

Finally convinced you to come over and just say hi
I say forever my lady
And kissed you for the very first time
After months, holidays, holding hands in the park
Normally I'll just play basketball
With someone in the park
And I messed up like boys tend to do
It'd be a year till I got back with you
Thank God that you called me back baby
'Cause I'd never be the man that I am today

For the rest of my life you know I'm gonna be yours
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life for you I'm gonna be strong
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay mine

Then one night upon the phone
You said you were at home alone
I wasn't even old enough to drive
I saw my only chance just to keep it alive
Keep love alive
Good thing for you I stole my daddy's car
'Cause no one's ever gonna love you back
Better than I do

For the rest of my life you know I'm gonna be yours
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life for you I'm gonna be strong
For the rest of my life

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?

It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong

Robin Thicke,"One, two, look at you
Three, four, she locked the door
I keep knockin' and knockin' and knockin' and knockin'

She was born in Paris
At the age of 21
Love knew her
But she didn't know love
Love didn't hear her when she cried
Love didn't stand by her side
On the most important night, oh yeah

And now she's flyin' high
You can't hurt her no more
And now she's locked the door
'Cause you broke the key
And she got a bright spot on her face
Now that she got that little taste
She just wants more
She just wants more
She locked the door

I kept tryin' to tell you you were pushin' me too far
She locked the door
I kept tryin' to warn you you was slowly breakin' my heart
She locked the door
I kept givin' you all of it but you took way too much
She locked, locked, locked, locked, locked, locked that door
And I don’t know what this is but I know this ain’t love

One, two, look at you
Three, four, she locked the door
I keep knockin' and knockin' and knockin' and knockin'

One morning the tears started rolling down her empty face
That sparkle in her eye had been abruptly replaced
When I touched her she said wait, when I kissed her she pulled away
And I knew it was over, cause she had nothing left to say

But now she’s flying high you can’t hurt her no more
Now she’s locked the door because you broke the key
Now a world without you she calls whole
She ain't leavin' no porch light on
She just wants more, she just wants more

I kept tryin' to tell you you were pushin' me too far

I kept tryin' to warn you you was slowly breakin' my heart

Didn't I rock with you all night
Wasn't it good enough, don't lie
Didn't you tell me that I blew your mind
Brought out the animal in me
Nobody else can tame that beast
Why did you have to go and say goodbye

Now all I wanna do is get, get you back (get, get)
'Cause girl, you're still the best that I've ever had
A one, two, three, let's go

You used your love to tear me apart
Now put me back together (now put me back together)
You put a bullet into my heart
Now put me back together
Come on, I'm an addict
Come on, gotta have it
Come on, let me at it tonight
You used your love to tear me apart
Now put me back together

I wanna live between your legs
Hear all the freaky things you said
I don't like what you're turning me into, into
Baby, you left me on the floor
Now I keep driving past your door
I don't know why you gotta be so cruel (I don't know why)

Now all I wanna do is get, get you back
(Wanna get you back, yeah, yeah, baby, get you back)
'Cause girl you're still the best that I've ever had

I get more head than when they noddin'
Kitty on fleek, it's popping, I'm Mary Poppins
Just for the record, that hard is what I'm copping
Blasting 2Pac in some fishnet stockings
You know you miss this, right
M I S S, miss this spot
Used to call me Hillary cause I ride 'em (Rodham)

There's levels to this, you shoulda climbed up

And stood upon this velvet shore,
That looks out to the golden ship of Reason.""
The man took to the gentle life,

The wind cried to the skies,
I felt that I would cry as I was leaving.
Tomorrow is a step away,
Twice removed from yesterday's sadness.

Still I am a dream away,
Twice removed from yesterday's sweet madness. 
""And in my dream, I thought I heard
The truth behind the spoken word.

I thought that I had something to believe in.""
But all too soon the dream was gone,
And in the dust that lingered on,
The tears that I'd shed tried to free me.

Twice removed from yesterday's sadness.
Still I am a dream away,
Twice removed from yesterday's sweet madness.",Twice Removed from Yesterday

Taking all who hear that sound
Close your eyes, its about to begin

Hardly daring to breath, a new life you perceive
You try hard not to break the spell

Robin Trower,"If you stand in the light, you get the feel of the ride
And the music that plays in your ears
In your head you can hear, a voice so sweet and clear
And the music that plays in your head
As it flows up from the ground
Taking all who hear that sound
Close your eyes, its about to begin

Hardly daring to breath, a new life you perceive
You try hard not to break the spell
While at once it seems both, so far and yet so close
If you reach out to touch, it will be gone

As it flows up from the ground
Taking all who hear that sound

Close your eyes, its about to begin
Close your eyes, its about to begin
Close your eyes, its about to begin

In quiet places where the moss grows green

Sitting on her head like a paraffin stove
I'd fly away and be a bat
Across the air I would rove
Stepping like a tightrope walker
Putting one foot after another
Wearing black cherries for rings

Sitting on her head like a telegraph pole
Id fly away and be a bat
Across the air I would roll
Stepping like a tightrope walker
Putting one foot after another

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.

Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.
Hoping and prayin' for 
Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
Maybe, I'm searching though I don't succeed,
but someone look, there's a growing need.
Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning;
all that's left is an unhappy ending.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.

When you're huggin' with your baby
In the last row in the balcony?

Well, there's technicolor and cinemascope
A cast out a Hollywood
And the popcorn from the candy stand
Makes it all seem twice as good
There's alway lots of pretty girls
With figures they don't try to hide
But they never can compare
To the girl sittin' by my side

Roby Facchinetti,"Ho davanti ancora vita, anzi spero di più
Ma ne ho già da raccontarti
Non è stata una vacanza e nemmeno galera
Nè rimpianti né rimorsi
Ho anche avuto più cuori
E messo al mondo figli migliori di me
Quanto di me c'è in loro
La vita lo dirà

Non ho fatto il missionario, ho fatto danni e magie
Per bisogno e per amore
E alle donne ho regalato straordinarie bugie
Con in tasca mille lire
Dillo pure di me
Che nel momento giusto al posto giusto ero lì
Forse sì

E nei sogni e nei guai che sia quello
Che sia mai mi scordo un amico
Poi c'è chi non lo è più e anche chi non c'è più
Ma fa parte del gioco
Ho il mio quarto d'ora di gloria
E frane di malinconia
Ma che vita la mia

Ho cantato a voce piena
Le mie normalità e miei castelli in aria
Poi lontano dalla scena
Ho incontrato città che ti fan mancare l'aria
Però anch'io come te
Ho ancora una valigia di sogni a metà
Da riempire
Poi succede anche a me di non farcela più
O di farcela appena
Siamo uguali io e te, stima volando su e giù
Sulla stessa altalena
Fra il mio quarto d'ora di gloria
E tempi che scappano via
Ho una vita la mia

Ho il mio quarto d'ora di gloria
E frane di malinconia
Ma che vita la mia

Ho il mio quarto d'ora di gloria
E frane di malinconia
Fra il mio quarto d'ora di gloria
E tempi che scappano via  (ma che vita la mia)
Fra il mio quarto d'ora di gloria
E tempi che scappano via

My soul and all of my heart IÂ´ll give to you 
But my trust is something that I put in few

That what you say you're gonna do 
Is something that will become reality

Ever since I was a little girl even younger than I am now

I don´t know how 
And we always seem to find our way back to the love 
that we are sharing 
And every time we say it´s over 
I can't forget you sweet loving 
After every time we brake up  things always turn out the same 
I tell myself that I have shaped up  
but I am still a part of this game 
You always seem to come back into my life 
When I thought I´ve forgotten you, you always show up 
It´s drivin´ me crazy, it´s got me going wild 
And I don´t know if this is ever gonna stop 
You always seem to come back into my world 
And this time I hope we´re stayin´ on track 
´Cause I don´t want to be anybodyelses girl 
I hope this is the last time you´ll ever come back 
I want you back ´cause you´re a good man, 
The kinda´ man who loves you all through the night 
And though it never turns out like I planned 
Somehow it feels so right 
So this time, boy don´t run away 
´Cause you´ll always have a place in my heart 
And I swear I´m gonna love you ´til the day, 
´Til the day that death do us part

I don´t have the strength to be proud anymore 
I want it all to be just like before

Is that I want you to come back, Come back to stay, 
I love you

And just one, little hint will do

And I know, I give too much
And there is much that I sacrifice
But I've got all the reasons
When I look into your eyes

I know I love you even though I shouldn't
And you should know I've tried to stop

But you've got that somethin'
Somethin' I can't describe
It gives me that feelin'
It gives me that freakin' vibe

You've got that somethin'
That makes me feel so fine
Makes it worth waitin'
Until the day that you will be mine, all mine

You decide to take your time, I just want you to know that
I'll always be here for you friends keep tellin' me
""You gotta let go"", they say that I'm too good for you
And maybe that is true

But I'll just keep on lovin' you the way I did before
And you should know I've tried to stop

VERSE 1
In another time, another life
Would have taken time out
In another situation I would have made you mine,
To make sure you'd be fine
I could feel you coming, I knew you would
And it hurts me so to let you go
I want you to live but I'm not all I wanna' give
But I never imagined you'd be so good
Right now nothing can be right,
All I can do is keep believing
Right now nothing can be wrong
That life goes on and on

CHORUS
I'm giving you back, to the stars

I'm giving you back, to where you came from
I'm giving you back, to the ocean
But I'm not forgetting who you areVERSE 2

With you in me I was beautiful
Two months of joy, before the impossible
Every second I long for the day
When the time is right, when there's no wrong
When you come back, come back to stay
I'll be there for you and I'll be strong
I'm still open if you still want me
And I promise I'll be all I can be
Right now nothing can be right
All I can do is keep believing
That life goes on and on
Right now nothing can be wrong,

CHORUS

BRIDGE
You made me see a lot clearer
Heaven is not that far

one day I hope to be closer
To be as pure as I know that,
I know that you are



",Giving You Back
Robyn,"Have you ever have that strange feeling?
Something is just not right
So lately is a kind of changing
Into someone you don't know is right
You can't figure out why all you do is fine
You don't understand why you're so sure it is a lie
You give, he takes, he gives, you turn away

Healthy love, someting that I'm scared of
Feels like a conspiresy
Why is these so nice to me
Healthy love, something I'm dreaming of
When he's gone he's all I want
When he's gone I can't go on
Healthy love (healthy love)
Healthy love
When he's gone I can't go on.

Listen to yourself
His heart is yours
But I hear hear his trying
All you do is ask for more
How can a girl be sure
When her heart is sore
She can alfoy to ignore that tomorrow he might walk out the door
You give, he takes, he gives, you turn away (why do you turn away? Turn away!)

Healthy love, someting that I'm scared of
Feels like a conspiresy
Why is these so nice to me

But they don't know you like I do I do?.

But with your pain
I still can't walk away until every chance gone

Robyn,"Robyn ? My Truth


If I don't say what you wanna hear
If I don't dress in what you want me to wear
If I don't think the way you do
I can't help it cause that's my truth

If my humor makes you bored
If my religion isn't yours
If my authority doesn't fit my youth
I can't help it cause that's my truth

You see the truth often hurts
But if it's honest it's always worth it
Can't deny that I'm subjective
But no truth can be objective
Even though it's universal
It's always individual
My truth, your truth, his truth, her truth
It doesn't matter as long as it's true

If my culture is something you don't know
Is unfamiliar and uncomfortable
I suggest you get to know my rules
Before you judge me, cause that's my truth

If your opinion is different from mine
If where I say go, is where you draw the line
Even if I may not agree
I will except cause it's your truth and it sets you free

You see the truth often hurts
But if it's honest it's always worth it
Can't deny that I'm subjective
But no truth can be objective
Even though it's universal
It's always individual
My truth, your truth, his truth, her truth
It doesn't matter as long as it's true

Don't you loose your truth
For whatever it's worth
Don't you try to compromise 
With your own lies

You see the truth often hurts
But if it's honest it's always worth it
Can't deny that I'm subjective
But no truth can be objective
Even though it's universal
It's always individual

It doesn't matter as long as it's true

Robyn,"Isn't funny how some people
Never practice what the preach 
Isn't it sad that the strongest arms
Still to short to reach
I watch him struggle with the fact that
His become what he said he'll never be
Hip parties and sunglasses at night
They help him not to see
Can he see

That he's been high on a young girls ride
Never lone on a Saturday night
He's been a around the world about a million times
But he's never been love
Not on the inside

Isn't so messed up to be witness for a man who won't confess
He won't confess, no
That he lost his truth
So god help him believe in his own prayers
I watch him struggle with the fact that
He relies on people that don't really care, the don't care, no no no
You say that the business is a whack 
So baby why are you so deep in there

Don't need prophets or preachers
To make sense of the signs
When the buried and hidden can
Be seen by the blind

[Chorus]
You're right
Some words are just unspoken
So right
Then it all just falls apart

The day I break your heart

I caught my reflection
In the corner of your eye
You said ""Don't even ask the question,
And I won't tell the lie""
Where there's no accusation
There's no need for denial
And if you hadn't heard that whisper
There'd be no tear to
Wipe from your eye

[Chorus]

The day I break your heart

Never took no advice
Not the foolish, not the wise
All the truth that I needed
Was right there in your smile
Every prophecy written of
What's going to be
All beginnings and
Endings, they're about
You and me

[Chorus: x2]

The day I break your heart",Eclipse
Robyn,"Hey now boy,
Where you've been?
Smashed up toy
Are you lost again?
Your circuits blown
Will you find your coordinates home?

Your batteries low
Did you crash again?
Robotboy, don't you need a friend?
Hey little droid,
Is your head on wrong?

Hey little prince
You've lost control
Calender boy are you growing old
Your radar's jammed
Shut your laser downs while you can

Hush now boy,
Please give in
Robotboy, you've reached the end
Hey little boy

Don't you even try and explain how it's so different when we kiss

But I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt before
I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible
Your love is ultra magnetic and it's taking over
This is hardcore
And I'm indestructible

Hands up in the air like we don't care
We're shooting deep into space
And the lasers split the dark
Cut right through the dark

It's just us, we ignore the crowd dancing
Fall to the floor
Beats in my heart
Put your hands on my heart

Robyn,"I've gone around the world and the seven seas
I'm cashin' six-figure checks in all currencies
It's like when I be tearin' it up in Paris
Motherfuckers parler on the M-I-C
It's all ""ooh la la"" and ""ah, oui oui""
Sippin' vin blanc in our lingerie
Choppin' heads off with madame guillotine
Even the French know better than to fuck with me

Comment allez-vous Robyn, what it do
I'm in the UK (Why?) got a show to do (Uh-huh)
It's big Snoopy Dogg, check the catalog
I'm overseas gettin' cheese with this dialogue
I missed my plane to Spain so I'm stuck in Colonna
I'm sippin' Saronno with this chick named Ramona
She wants me to take a flick on her phone-ah
Then take her to my hotel room and then bone her

You know when in Rome I sat down with the Romans
Said ""We need a black pope and she better be a woman""
There'll be no more celibacy
Even the Vatican knows not to fuck with me

You should know better
You should know better
You should know better than to fuck with me
If you knew better you would do better
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better than to fuck with me
If you knew better you would do better

We big-ballin' in Holland, Amsterdam my man
I got a table at the coffee shop
Where we like to spark a lot
Hangin' in the parking lot blowin' a bleezy
Easy fo sheezy deezy

I crashed a party with the Czar
Threw a Molotov cocktail in the bar
And you know my style's revolutionary
Even the Russians know better than to fuck with me

You try to ban me, you can't stand me
'Cause I'm an outlaw
Black president livin' in the White House
Mr. B he wrote a letter to me
The FBI know better than to fuck with me

Yo, I was there at Watergate
You know I rigged my gear got the fuckers on tape
They put the mic in the hand of the wrong MC
Even the C-I-A knows not to fuck with me

You should know better
You should know better
You should know better than to fuck with me
If you knew better you would do better
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better than to fuck with me

Tell 'em Snoop, tell 'em like it is

I been there, in there, out there like that
Right back to the hood, a hundred Euro stacks
Shoot motherfuckers just on GP
L-A-P-D know better than to fuck with me

I danced with the devil in Kathmandu
I came hummin' and blastin' with the boogaloo too
Now I declare most solemnly
The prince of darkness know better than to fuck with me

You know not what you know
Tell 'em what I'm in it for
Then I run up in it slow
Really though, silly ho
Yea spend a minute though
I blow an ounce and make you bounce
Just like a sixty-four

Now you know me I'm a woman of peace
I don't never take nothin' don't belong to me
I throw down and say ""Whatever's gonna be, gonna be
The whole industry knows not to fuck with me""

You should know better
You should know better
You should know better than to fuck with me

You take the lizard's mask but look who's lying in the cask
And the clocks have stopped you'll find out what the lizard dropped

I see that nothing makes a sound.
I move invisible as air,
And choose the time to disappear.

The spirit started long ago.
They've found somewhere they couldn't go.
They spend their time just looking out
For those who never share a doubt.
Ah, ah, ah, ah - they're in love with you.
The seagull, on the seeping sand,
Can die but never understand
The oil that festers on our shore
Will cast a stain forever more.
Ah, ah, ah, ah - who's in love with that?
The gnomes are moving through the night;
They sing and fiddle with delight.
And we eat Weetabix and sing
About the joys that love can bring,
Ah, ah, ah, ah - if they ever come.
The sun is shining very hard;
It melts both margarine and lard.
But, me, I only dream of you.
I hope that you are dreaming too.

Or an iceberg in the sun""

To get back from the moon
And throw her arms around you
In a very quiet lagoon

Well, that loneliness is nothing

Who still believes he's real

I'm looking for illusions that could sew me up for good
Could be a religion with a shiny leather hood
And if you think that's good, well that's alright
Maybe you could come on round tonight, sweet mama

And the old one rang on a dismal bell

With one piece of paper
He waved at the camera
Peace in our time

Tell that to the Jews

Up to the bathroom
And then you lead
Them into the bedroom

You smile like a bowl
You grin like a melon

They think that they know you
They're too busy thinking
To see who you are

I'll reach your lungs
Like smoke in the orchard
Scattered in bushes
The firemen laughing
I'll rap your hands
With personal signals

The yawning cross
The hill full of pebbles

Our love has been found guilty
Our love is turning bad

Have you anything to add?
It wasn't easy, but
It wasn't fun
But when you start these things
See what you've done
You're the executioner of love
You're the executioner
Your childhood is over
There's nowhere you can hide
There's nowhere you can hide
There's nowhere you can hide

Even if you don't mean it
It's only just a kiss

And the rain falls, up from the ground

Just one thing, baby, you forgot my heart
Just one thing, baby, you forgot my heart

And I remember when I was young, they said: ""work hard.""
And I said: ""certainly, 'cause it's fun.""
And so I tried it; I did what I could
Made no difference; it never did any good

Just one thing, baby, you forgot my heart

About a lucky man who made the grade

Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

They had to count them all

I didn't even care what happened next
I was free as a penny whistle, and silent as the glove

That vanished into nothing -- into love

I couldn't see his face I took his hand (I couldn't see...)

Robyn Hitchcock,"Uncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child may prove to
Be ugly in a fully grown adult.

Lack of involvement with the father, or over-involvement with the mother,
Can result in lack of ability to relate to sexual fears, and in homosexual
Leanings, narcissism, transexuality 
(Girls from the waist up, men from the waist down), 
Attempts to be your own love object. 

Reconcile your parents to you by becoming both at once!
Even Marilyn Monroe was a man, but this tends to get overlooked by our
Mother-fixated, overweight, sexist media.

So,
Uncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child may prove to
Be ugly in a fully grown adult.

If you give in to them
Every time they cry
They will become little tyrants
But they won't remember why
Then when they are thwarted
By people in later life
They will become psychotic
And they won't make an ideal husband or wife
The spoiled baby grows into
The escapist teenager who's
The adult alcoholic who's
The middle-aged suicide (Oy)

I fell in love with an English girl
Her skin was clear and her mum wore pearls
I fell in love with an English girl

She asked me for an almond whirl
I was obliged to the English girl
And when I found the one she curled
All round my neck, did the English girl

But when the wrapper she unfurled
""It's a little bit off,"" said the English girl
Though disappointed, 'round she twirled
Poise was a must for the English girl

The sweet she binned, it was not hurled
Slow motion for the English girl
""How disappointing wanton her""
Said the diamond mouth of the English girl
""I hoped for more,"" said the English girl

So Haggard and I don't mean more
I wilted before the English girl
And like a minx from Ronald's serve
She flittered away, with the English girl

Years ago in a silent world
I fell in love with an English girl

Past the point 
Of no return - 
No going back now:
Our passion-play
Has now, at last
Begun...
Past all thought
Of right or wrong -
One final question:
How long should we
Two wait, before
We're one...?

When will the blood
Begin to race,
The sleeping bud
Burst into bloom?
When will the flames,
At last consume
Us...?

BOTH
Past the point
Of no return,
The final threshold -
The bridge
Is crossed, so stand
And watch it burn...
We've passed the point
Of no return...

PHANTOM
Say you'll share with
Me one
Love, one lifetime...
Lead me, save me
From my solitude...

Say you want me
With you,
Here beside you...
Anywhere you go
Let me go too -

That's all I ask of...

Robyne Dunn,"Good morning heartache, you old gloomy sight
Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Good morning heartache, sit down

Rocca,"Depuis mon plus jeune âge, je rêve de gloire, de cash-flow,
Dois-je passer ma vie en marge
D'un système qui me dévisage?
Mon panache comme bagage sûr, j'assure mon avenir
Mon futur je le vois prospère, fat, duplex, buzy,
Compte en caisse rempli
Grosse sacoche, Borsalino, BM, Porche
Nombreux rêves de mioche m'ont poussé à remplir mes poches
Avenue Foch, gloire, pouvoir sortir de la rue,
Croire, vouloir se battre pour avoir ce qui t'es dù
N'est jamais cause perdue
Le monde est devant toi, n'attends pas qu'il débarque
Sort de ton cul-de-sac, do cycle infernal do jeune que le béton détraque
De l'ignorance, la délinquence, la violence
Ta soit-disante malchance que toi-même sème par négligence
Échec scolaire, vices, mauvaise compagnies qui te trahissent
Fils! Démolis pour reconstruire ce que tu négligeais jadis
Je crois en moi...en toi...le futur est entre nos mains
Et rien ne doit pouvoir barrer nos chemins...

Refrain
Pour tous les jeunes de l'univers: ce message universel
""Je représente, nous représentons""
Je le dédie à ceux que j'aime
""Dans tout ce béton dans tout ce béton""
Pour tous les jeunes de l'univers: ce message universel
""Je représente, nous représentons""
Pense qu'aujourd'hui, see'est ton jour pour lutter et vaincre garçon!
""Le monde est devant toi, n'attend pas qu'il débarque""

Ceci va pour tous les jeunes des cités
Lascars et filles oubliées, banlieues condamnées, villes et quartiers damnés
Déshérités, exclus de la chance, fils d'immigrés déçus
Tous ceux qui ont dans leurs yeux, quelque chose d'horizon perdu
Fils de chahut, grandissant sous le souffle de l'obus
Ceux qui ont disparu sans jamais avoir connu la joie
Ma génération s'élève do béton comme un drapeau
America Latina, Africa represento Columbia
Le tiers do monde, l'allégresse d'outre-tombe
La tristesse d'un jeune en détresse
Pleurant derrière des barreaux sa jeunesse
Donne l'example, montre aussi que tu peux t'en sortir
L'espérance est vitale comme l'oxygène que l'on respire
see'est le pire des combats, la perpétuelle querelle, la saga,
see'est le dominant sur le dominé, la loi do plus friqué
Renverse les statistiques, sondages
Prouve à ton entourage
Qu'un homme plein de courage, peux creuser son propre passage
Vers la victoire, la réussite
Malgré les multiples conflits raciaux, sociaux
En France...tout effort a une récompence go!!!
One Love! Pour tous les jeunes en bas des escaliers des cités, HLM
Je sème de l'espoir pour tout ceux que j'aime

Refrain

Depuis mon plus jeune âge, je rêve d'explorer le monde, la terre, ses mystères:
Imagine des voyages en première classe sans frontières
Sans passeport, en Concorde, coktail à la main
Observant l'univers do haut do ciel, volant de plus en plus loin
Choisir son destin, être maître de soi-même
Vivre pour ce que l'on aime
Malgré les contraintes do système
S'entraider, parler de fraternité, de confiance, oublier
Ses problèmes ne serait-ce qu'un instant, voir des mains se serrer
Mater la télé, voir moins de misères, de barrières sociales
Chômage, exclusion raciale, de police, front nationnal
Entendre les rires des enfants percer nos coeurs en béton
Préssé de batir un monde parfait basé sur le respect
Mais le monde tourne comme une roulette et rien ne changera
Quand ""le Tout Puissant"" fera ses comptes, lui seul jugera
Filles et garçons avançons d'une case nos pions
Unis, nous sommes la lumière do chemin où nous allons

Giù con un cappotto in legno! 
Nato in mezzo alla spirale, cresciuto male, 
Stato che mi vuole condannare, si  voglio parlare! 

E oggi non ho ancora visto se fuori c'è il sole, 
Già ho mandato a fare in culo due persone  sicuro piove!

Ha messo I morti sotto terra e ci ha pisciato sopra! 
Vittime di Stato, Mafia e droga  state tutti in coda!

Al giornalista che strumentalizza la mia gente per fare notizia! 
Sono sicuro che arriveranno giorni migliori, 
Per te che stai soffrendo e non vedi il mondo a colori! 

I traditori sono liberi lì fuori  io spero che gli onesti, 
Poi, saranno I vincitori! 
Sono vicino a chi stà male perché ha perso mamma o padre! 
Hai ragazzi chiusi in cella con la voglia di scappare! 

A chi si sente solo, ha il cuore che è un ghiacciolo, 
Un giorno vivi e un giorno invece sei attaccato al suolo! 
Non ho perso la speranza, anche se non è facile, 
Stracciare queste pagine e colmare la voragine! 
Lo stato mi fa schifo! 
Premia gli evasori  
I camorristi qui diventano assessori!

Rocco Hunt,"Questa mattina per fortuna c’è un’aria diversa
Il sole coi suo raggi penetra dalla finestra
Quant’è bella la mia terra
Mi manca quando parto
Porto una cartolina di riserva
Questo posto non deve morire
La mia gente non deve partire
Il mio accento si deve sentire
La strage dei rifiuti
L’aumento dei tumori
Siamo la terra del sole
Non la terra dei fuochi
Questa mattina per fortuna la storia è cambiata
Vedo la gente che sorride spensierata
Non esiste cattiveria
Si sta bene in strada
Il mondo si è fermato

Dimentica le banche, li presteremo noi a loro
Zero padrone, gli ruberemo il trono
Non c’è la fila allo sportello (e comm’è)
Se tifi un’altra squadra
Sei lo stesso mio fratello
Fate l'amore
Invece di impugnare quel coltello
La violenza è stata sempre il metodo di chi non ha cervello
Tagliate quella linea che divide nord e sud
Guardo il cielo per cercare chi purtroppo non c’è più
E’ un giorno nuovo anche per loro
E son sicuro che un sorriso l’ho strappato pure a voi lassù

Rocco Hunt,"Questa vita va 
Non so come, non so dove 
L’alta velocità mi porta via dalle persone 
Non trovo le parole, preferisco stare solo 
Non parlo, vorrei che questa gente mi capisse al volo 
Cosa mi rimane di te? 
Una vecchia foto tra l’altro pure sbiadita, 
Avevi il tuo maglione nuovo. 
Sei cresciuta, ti ho visto l’altro giorno con tua madre 
Il taglio nuovo non è male, il tuo colore naturale. 
Sei cresciuta in queste mani ed eravamo bimbi 
Dicevi se facciamo figli, speriamo che mi assomigli
Passi per strada e non saluti, fai un errore 
Non si tratta di rimpianti, si tratta di educazione 
Ci chiedono il perché scriviamo canzoni tristi 
Triste come il mondo di cui siamo protagonisti 
Toglimi la penna di me rimane niente 
La musica è finita e queste luci sono spente. 

Lei non ritorna più, e se torna non è lei 
Adesso sta con lui, sono giorni in cui schiaccerei Replay 
Che ne sarà di noi? 
Tu non eri il mostro che ora sei 
Adesso stai con lui, sono giorni in cui schiaccerei Replay 

Sento freddo e non è il tempo, è il freddo che c’ho dentro 
Le persone sono come il vento, e tu forse sei l’esempio 
Ma che ne so che cos’è l’amore, conosco I danni 
Gli anni non cancellano la delusione 
Le tue promesse false, come I Ti Amo che dicevi 
Ma la vita non perdona se non dai quando ricevi 
Non so fidarmi di nessuno ed è un peccato 
Mi ha tradito sempre chi mi aveva accarezzato 
Cerchiamo sempre la persona della vita 
Ma poi quando la incontriamo gli diciamo che è finita sai 
L’essere umano non può accontentarsi mai 
Anche dopo la vittoria cercherà qualche altra sfida 
Sono sempre un pazzo che crede ancora al bene 
Lo scrivo dentro a un pezzo solo per farlo sapere 
Me ne torno a casa mia, non è successo niente 
Ti ritorno indietro tutti e torno giù tra la mia gente 

Lei non ritorna più, e se torna non è lei 
Adesso sta con lui, sono giorni in cui schiaccerei Replay 
Che ne sarà di noi? 
Tu non eri il mostro che ora sei 
Adesso stai con lui, sono giorni in cui schiaccerei Replay 

Lei non ritorna più, e se torna non è lei

Venderei più copie se solo facessi fitness

Schianto gli altri rapper sopra il guardrail (take down)

Averlo qui a due passi e vederci il sole tramontare.

Insegnano agli adulti a distruggere I castelli di rabbia.

Brindiamo alla salute.

Che tranquillità,
Cellulari spenti e cuori aperti
Spegni I social ed accendi I sentimenti
Era più bello da bambini,
Spensierati ed innocenti
E c ce pozz fà,
Rimpiango spesso I vecchi tempi.
Vieni con te,
Stasera cena, ti porto in costiera
Niente lume di candela, il cielo già fa scena.
Quando ti parleranno male del mio Sud
Tu rinnega tutto e falli scendere qua giù
E spegni la tv,
Tutte quelle parole non ci toccheranno più
Bruciano col sole, un salto ella tradizione,
Nun ce sta paragone.
E andiamo dai miei amici,
Sent già nu buon addor.
E non ridere quando parlo in dialetto
È una lingua per l'UNESCO
Quindi porta più rispetto.
Questa gente non ha niente,
Però sorride sempre,
E se non parlo col dialetto,
A stì person chi e difend?

Classe novantaquattro
Classe 1-9 ottanta
Classe 1-9-7-2

Quella volta, per pensare ai soldi, ho perso i sogni
Restiamo poveri ma ricchi di ricordi
Tutto ciò che ho visto, lo scrivo, registro
Poi parlo con le donne, col muro, con Cristo
Classe novantaquattro dagli anni in cui
Ti ammazza lo stato e non è stato lui
Tua madre con Barbara D'Urso in TV
Tu cresci e ti chiedi se credergli più
Quindi faccio l'alba, musica bastarda
L'unica compagna che non si fa di bamba
Se aspettavo la politica, morivo di fame
Hanno corrotto tuo nonno ed illuso tuo padre
Non avevamo niente quando andavamo in centro
Ci portavamo sempre parte del quartiere dentro
Periferia bastarda, sei tutti i miei ricordi
Ti guarderò dai vetri neri mentre dormi

Lo stato ci promette cose che non manterrà
Un altro presidente non mi rappresenterà
Ora piove su di noi, non so più quello che voglio
Perché non avevo niente
Solo una moneta e un sogno
Solo una moneta e un sogno

Mi ricordo anni fa, fra, senza futuro
Fatto duro, che fumavo un puro
Stavo all'angolo
Ora street superstar, prendo questi rapper qua
Frate, li butto a pietà come il Michelangelo
Tieni a mente che sei sempre solo
Fare il grano, hermano, è il mio ruolo
Il milione come Marco Polo
Come il gruppo dei tre babbi, frate, prendo il volo
Avevo una moneta e un sogno e adesso
Che c'ho molto più cash, faccio incubi spesso
Yeah, classe 1-9 ottanta
Cresciuto con lo sporco della panca sui panta
Ora verso rime in banca, fra, carta canta
Penso solo ai miei frati con la firma
Vesto solo i miei capi con la firma
Bacio la mia tipa G: Donna Imma

Lo stato ci promette cose che non manterrà
Un altro presidente non mi rappresenterà
Ora piove su di noi, non so più quello che voglio
Perché non avevo niente
Solo una moneta e un sogno
Solo una moneta e un sogno

Seh, lasciami qui nella Paradise City
Dove l'erba è potente e il sesso è easy
Sui vagoni firmati con la vernice, le fighe
Le borse firmate con dentro il teaser
E tu con le catene d'oro finto, è nichel
Dischi d'oro fatti al quinto repack
Fabbrica di cioccolato, hai vinto il ticket
Io, leggenda come Wilson Pickett
Classe 1-9-7-2
Venuto su, negli Ottanta, con la para dell'HIV
E vedi tu, l'eroina ha ucciso più della P2
Ma io ricordo solo la TV
Dicevo: ""Chi se ne frega"", da solo su 'sto pianeta
Qui tutti sognano i soldi, io coi sogni farò moneta

Lo stato ci promette cose che non manterrà
Un altro presidente non mi rappresenterà
Ora piove su di noi, non so più quello che voglio

As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill

Rocco Scotti,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura
Roch Voisine,"Assise sur ta valise 
Tu regardes l'horizon

Comme un léger frisson 
C'est loin la terre promise

Sous la porte d'entrée 
Avec sous tes regrets 

Si tu t'en vas

D'effacer tes repères

Où tout est trop petit 
Où plus rien n'est fait pour toi

Roch Voisine,"She was a woman troubled like a river
Trees all around her
But I only ever came near enough
To hear her voice
On the outside

She was a woman inside a castle
Knights all around her
And I never found myself strong enough
To reach and touch
From the outside

And every time I tried to swim across
I thought I'd drown
And every time I tried to climb that wall
I thought I'd fall
On the outside

She was a woman frozen in a picture
Frozen there forever
With a smile that keeps me so warm inside
But still I hide
On the outside

She was a woman farther than forever
Nearer not together
And I only wish I was back in time
'Cause she'd be mine
On the outside

But every time I tried to find the love 
I left behind
But every time I tried to make her mine
Again I'd find myself
On the outside",On the Outside

Laid by the people of faith and pride

And the few things that took to survive

Was your loving heart and mine

I'll always be there

Will follow the trace
Laid but people of faith and pride
With angry eyes gone blind

Will show them the light

Your memory flickers like a flame
It echoes like a distant tune
Dances on the four walls of my room

With hair as black as a book of prayer
Your laughter filled the morning air
Now it doesn't seem so long ago
But how we ever parted, I don't know

Where are you now? So far away
If only some how the night would disappear
And I could have you here
There's a breeze on the water

Blowing time back to me
I can still see your face
Kissing Rain
We wandered through a hundred days

And watched the stars on Half-Moon Bay
Then like a season you were gone
You left me on a frozen April dawn
You were the storm-in my sky

If only once more I could be so free
Feel you washing over me
There's a breeze on the water
Blowing time back to me

I can still see your face
Kissing Rain
There's a long cool river
Running wild to the sea

And I am calling your name
Kissing Rain
I'm a prisoner of time
And I'm chained to memories

How can you be so free
There's a breeze
There is a long cool river
Running wild to the sea

And I am calling your name
Kissing Rain
There's a breeze on the water
(Daughter of the thunder)

Blowing time back to me
(Your face turned towards the sky)
I can still see your face
(Standing high on a hillside babe)

Kissing Rain
There's a long cool river
(I'm a prisoner of time)
Running wild to the sea

Roch Voisine,"Won't you tell me where we go from here
So many thoughts but none of them are clear
We've always been each other's main support
Was I to blame when you walked out the door?

You really never had much time to talk
You took your morning coffee then you'd walk
I guess you didn't like the family plan
What part of love did you not understand?

Cause love never dies
Not in my eyes
So I hold on to hope
Thinking you will come home


`Cause love never dies
I've watched you sitting all alone at night
But I was just a shadow by your side
(Can you hear me? Can you hear me calling?)


Now I live my life just hoping for
(Answer me, Please answer me)
A chance to have you back once more
(Baby please, Why don't you answer me please)

`Cause love never dies
No not in my eyes
So I hold on to hope
Thinking you will come home


`Cause love never dies
Love doesn't feel hard it can be
To stand in the dark
Trust in your heart

And love never dies
After all this time I still believe
Love will lead you right back here to me
Look in your heart you will see

(Love never dies) Love never dies
(Not in my eyes) No, no
So I hold on to hope
Thinking you will come home

Roch Voisine,"We're in love,
And we're alone.
The silence spoke,
And told me so.
Stuck in the middle
Of a restless heart;
No place else to go.

Feeling you.
Overtime,
I hear your thoughts
Inside my mind,
And I'd be crazy
If I let you go.
Darling you should know...
I wanna love again.
I wanna feel this way.
Stay with me;
I won't leave you, lonely.
And let tomorrow come,
We've only just begun.
Stay with me,
Oh, stay with me.

I'd been lost
In no man's land,
Till the day you took my hand,
And led me gently
To the other side.
Now I understand.

I wanna love again.
I wanna feel this way.
Stay with me;
I won't leave you, lonely.
And let tomorrow come,
We've only just begun.
Stay with me,
Oh, stay with me.
Let love pass this way again...
Love is the answer.
The fever and the cure.
It's burning inside of me,
And darling, now I know for sure.

I wanna love again.
I wanna feel this way.
Stay with me;
I won't leave you, lonely.
Love is the key.
Love is the key.
Stay... Stay.
I wanna love again.

I've held you in my arms
Your love was all I had
But you had to end it all

I've stood out in the rain
I've listened for your call
That never came at all
With these eyes
You're everything to me

That a sad song doesn't care
Whose heart it breaks

I've waited patiently
For you whose love I need so much
With these eyes
I've watched you turn away
With nothing left to give
And nothing more to say

You're everything to me
Without your love

I've learned from my mistake
That a sad song doesn't care

It doesn't mean that you and I
Are sharing the same dream
If only I could listen to your words
And not my heart
You're tryin' to spare my feelings
But you're tearing me apart

You're everything to me
Without your love

Roch Voisine,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'n' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'n' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
'n' Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billy Joe
Rochelle House,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'

Rochelle House,"Ollie told me I'm a fool. 
So I walked on down the road a mile, 
Went to the house that brings a smile
Sat upon my grandpa's knee, 
And what do you think he said to me?

When you awake you will remember ev'rything, 
You will be hangin' on a string from your
When you believe, 
You will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know

Ollie showed me the fork in the road.
You can take to the left or go straight to the right,
Use your days and save your nights,
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat,
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat.

[Chorus]

Ollie warned me it's a mean old world,
The street don't greet ya, yes, it's true;
But what am I supposed to do:
Read the writing on the wall,
I heard it when I was very small.

[Chorus]

Wash my hand in lye water, 
I got a date with the captains daughter. 
You can go and tell your brother. 
We sure gonna love one another, oh! 
You may be right and ya might be wrong, 
I ain't gonna worry all day long.

Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite, 
My old car froze up last night. 
Ain't no reason to hang your head 
I could wake up in the mornin' dead. 
Oh! And if I thought it would do any good,

Rocío Dúrcal,"Son las diez de la mañana
Cruzo la puerta apurada del juzgado 23
Siento un nudo en la garganta
Y una lágrima de tantas ya corre sobre mi piel

Tengo miedo de encontrarlo
Siento ganas de abrazarlo de preguntarle por qué
Pero una voz que me llama por mi nombre y su apellido
Me pone delante de él

Cuando él me mira a los ojos
Yo siento que aquel enojo ya no existe entre los dos
Porque el amor es más fuerte pero estamos frente a frente

De un señor llamado Juez que ignora lo que sentimos
Porque un día decidimos pedir la separación
Pero eso fue un mal momento, un tiro en los sentimientos
Que casi mató a los dos

Cómo puede señor Juez, usted que ha estudiado tanto
No reconocer el llanto de dos que se quieren tanto
Ante Dios y frente a usted
Cómo puede señor Juez solamente en un segundo
Cambiarle a la vida el rumbo y acabar con nuestro mundo
Con su firma en un papel

Que más que amor es un sufrir

Pa' borrar antiguos besos
En los besos de otras bocas

Porque causa es siempre mía

Quiero por los dos mi copa alzar
Para olvidar mi obstinación
Y más la vuelvo a recordar

Y sentir junto a mi boca, como
Un fuego su, respiración

Angustias, de sentirme abandonado
Y sentir que otro a su lado, pronto
Pronto, le hablara de amor

Hermano, yo no quiero rebajarme
Ni pedirle, ni rogarle, ni decirle
Que no puedo más vivir

Es mi triste soledad
Veré caer, las rosas muertas
De mi juventud

Gime bandoneón, tu tango, gris
Quizás a ti te hiera igual
Algún amor, sentimental

Llora mi alma de fantoche
Sola y triste en esta noche
Noche negra y sin estrellas

Si las copas traen consuelo, aquí estoy
Con mis desvelos
Para ahogarlos de una vez

Quiero emborrachar el corazón
Para después poder brindar
Por los fracazos del amor

Que me dejes abierto el balcón de tus ojos de gata""

Dibujo un corazón
Y mi mano le correspondió debajo de tu falda
Caminito al hostal
Nos besamos en cada farola
Era un pueblo con mar

Yo quería dormir contigo y tú no querías dormir sola
Y nos dieron las diez y las once, las doce y la una
Y las dos y las tres
Y desnudos al amanecer nos encontró la luna
Nos dijimos adiós
Ojalá que volvamos a vernos
El verano acabó
El otoño duró lo que tarda en llegar el invierno

Y a tu pueblo el azar
Otra vez el verano siguiente
Me llevó, y al final
Del concierto me puse a buscar tu cara entre la gente
Y no halle quien de ti
Me dijera ni media palabra
Parecía como si
Me quisiera gastar el destino una broma macabra

No había nadie detrás
De la barra del otro verano
Y en lugar de tu bar
Me encontré una sucursal del banco hispano americano
Tu memoria vengué
A pedradas contra los cristales
""Se que no lo soñé""
Protestaba mientras me esposaban los municipales

En mi declaración
Alegué que llevaba tres copas
Y empecé esta canción
En el cuarto donde aquella vez te quitaba la ropa
Y nos dieron las diez y las once, las doce y la una
Y las dos y las tres
Y desnudos al amanecer nos encontró la luna",Y Nos Dieron Las Diez

Rocío Jurado,"Grabé tu nombre en mi barca, me hice por ti marinero 
Para cruzar los mares surcando los deseos 
Fui tan feliz en tus brazos, fui tan feliz en tu puerto 
Que el corazón quedó preso de tu cuerpo y de tu piel 

Como una ola tu amor llegó a mi vida 
Como una ola de fuego y de caricias 
De espuma blanca y rumor de caracolas 
Como una ola 

Y yo quedé prendida a tu tormenta 
Perdí el timón sin darme apenas cuenta 
Como una ola tu amor creció 
Como una ola 

Bajé del cielo una estrella en el hueco de mis manos 
Y la prendí a tu cuello cuando te dije te amo 
Pero al mirarte a los ojos vi una luz de desencanto 
Me avergoncé de mi estrella y llorando me dormí 

Como una ola tu amor llegó a mi vida 
Como una ola de fuerza desmedida 
Sentí en mis labios tus labios de amapola 
Como una ola 

Y me escapé contigo mar adentro 
Sin escuchar las voces en el viento 
Como una ola se fue tu amor

Sin escuchar las voces en el viento

Rocío Jurado,"Unos dicen que es un loco melancólico
Que te asalta por la espalda y a traición
Otros dicen que es un médico fantástico
Porque suaviza los vaivenes de tu corazón

Hay quien dice que es un angelito cínico
Caprichoso, malcriado y juguetón
Yo prefiero imaginarlo suave y tímido
Un salvavidas más de mi imaginación

Nadie sabe dónde está
Nadie sabe dónde vive, su apellido ni su edad
Pero todos le llamamos por lo menos una vez
Una vez en nuestra vida

Amigo, amor
Si tú pudieras darte un vuelo por aquí
Y te quedaras un ratito junto a mí
Ten por seguro que me harías un favor

Amigo, amor
Donde te metes que hace tiempo que no sé
Qué bien suena el corazón cuando hace pie
Hace ya tiempo que no sé lo que es amor

Unos dicen que se viste de romántico
Otros dicen que se pinta de ladrón
Es simpático y cruel, es lento y rápido
El argumento favorito de cualquier conversación

Hay quien piensa es pañuelo para lágrimas
Hay quien dice que es leal pero es infiel
Sólo sé que te acompaña entre las sábanas
Cuando no tienes quién se muera por tu piel

Nadie sabe dónde está
Nadie sabe dónde vive, su apellido ni su edad
Pero todos le llamamos por lo menos una vez
Una vez en nuestra vida

Amigo, amor
Si tú pudieras darte un vuelo por aquí
Y te quedaras un ratito junto a mí

de tanto usarlo
de tanto loco abrazo
sin medidas
de darnos por completo
a cada paso
se nos quedo en las manos
un buen dia

Se nos rompió el amor
de tan grandioso
jamas pudo existir
tanta belleza
las cosas tan hermosas
duran poco

Jamas duró una flor
dos primaveras
me alimenté de ti
por mucho tiempo
nos devoramos vivos
como fieras

Jamas pensamos nunca en el invierno
pero el invierno llega
aunque no quiera
y una mañana gris
al abrazarnos
sentimos un crujido
frio y seco
cerramos nuestros ojos y pensamos

Se nos rompió el amor
de tanto usarlo.

Rocío Jurado,"Por la noche con la luna
Tire las redes al agua
Si pudiera la memoria
Pa' que no me lastimar

Déjame tu que me pierda
En los callejones del agua
Más me vale que me dieran
A beber agua salada

Y si te lo encuentras
Pregúntale por que
Que por que una madrugada
Me dejo y se fue

Por salaba, por salaba
Por salaba, por salaba
Contra viento y marea mi barco va

Pescaba mi amor estrellas
En la oscuridad de la playa
Beso a beso, la marea
De mi orilla lo alejaba

Sácame de las agallas
Del callejón del amargo
Ayer la rosa cuidaba
Hoy la espina me clavo

Y si te lo encuentra
Pregúntale por que
Que por que una madrugada
Me dejo y se fue
Palabra de honor
Que esto no es una queja
Pero un poco el dolor
Que se esconde en tu amor
Me apretó bien las tuercas

Tú ya eras así
Y  yo ya estaba alerta
Corazón de metal
Que no entiende el amor
Si el no lleva las riendas

Palabra de honor
Que aún mi casa está abierta
Porque a tu corazón
Yo no tengo el valor

De cerrarle la puerta
Palabra de honor
Mi palabra de honor
Que esto no es una queja

Un día tu amor me atrapo
Y me pillo por sorpresa
Clavaste tus garras en mí
Como un ave de presa

Desperté entre tus brazos
Y sentí tus cadenas
Tú me dejabas vivir
Pero solo a tu manera

No me pidas perdón
Que ese no es tu sistema
Volveré junto a ti
Y lo hare sin rencor
Porque vale la pena

Palabra de honor
Que aún mi casa está abierta
Porque a tu corazón
Yo no tengo el valor

De cerrarle la puerta
Tengo yo la razón
Le coste el corazón
Y mi casa está abierta

Un día tu amor me atrapo
Y me pillo por sorpresa
Clavaste las garras en mí
Como un ave de presa

Desperté entre tus brazos
Y sentí tus cadenas
Tú me dejabas vivir
Pero solo a tu manera

Tiembla por naturales
Fíjate bien porque es un cuadro

Que este pintor pinta con arte
Y es de cartel esa muleta
Que al toro embebió y lo dominó

Cuadra José y en las agujas
Para su estoque el reloj

Clamor de dos orejas
Que los tendías
Se han encendía

La hondura de tus hechuras
En pie puso a la afición

And when I danced with You I finally found my place
It's so extraordinary in a normal way
Because I was made for loving You

There is no part of me Your eyes will escape
Through the night until the shadows drift away
Because I was made for loving You

Wake up you drummers, wake up those who praise

Well I'm waking up again
Waking up to all of your sorrow
Your eyes possessing me
Everywhere I turn, they follow
Turn away, cause I have you to thank
For all the hatred that I feel
Cause I've become so dead and hollow

Why don't you raise your hands
You gotta be so proud
Raise your hands
And let me know
Why don't you raise your hands
I wanna hear it loud
Raise your hands
And let me know, you care

When will all this end
When will all this go away
You were always testing me
Just another game you play
Your eyes possessing me...

Why don't you raise your hands
You gotta be so proud
Raise your hands
And let me know
Why don't you raise your hands
I wanna hear it loud
Raise your hands
And let me know, you care

Why don't you raise your hands
You gotta be so proud

In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes

Rockell,"I see your face cloud over like a little girl's,
And your eyes have lost thier shine.
You whisper something softly I'm not meant to hear,
Baby, tell me what's on your mind.

I don't care what people say
About the two of us from different worlds.
I love you so much that it hurts inside,
Are you listening?

Listen to me, girl.

Can't we try just a little bit harder?
Can't we give just a little bit more?
Can't we try to understand
That it's love we're fighting for?
Can't we try just a little more passion?
Can't we try just a little less pride?
Love you so much baby,
That it tears me up inside.

I hear you on the telephone with God knows who,
Spilling out your heart for free.
Everyone needs someone they can talk to,
Girl, that someone should be me.

So many times, I tried to tell you,
You just turned away.

How did I know?

My life is changing so fast now,
Leaves me lonely and afraid.

Don't be afraid, girl.

Can't we try just a little bit harder?
Can't we give just a little bit more?
Can't we try to understand
That it's love we're fighting for?
Can't we try just a little more passion?
Can't we try just a little less pride?
Love you so much baby,
That it tears me up inside.

Rockell,"Are you the someone I've been looking for?
Are you the one who's supposed
To make my life seem so much more?

And are you the picture, I painted
On nights when I needed a hand to hold
Someone to call my own?

I need a lover who's
Gonna stick around
Who knows when to begin
And never thinks about an ending

Are you ready for my love?
Are you ready to stand up?
And turn on the lights and
Show me what you've got inside

Are you ready to be brave and never walk away
Can you be wrong, can you be strong, no matter what
Are you ready for my love?

I'm not looking for a love that's unsure
I wanna be right beside you never ahead or behind you, boy
I don't wanna live my life in yesterday
The past is a memory, living today with me

I gotta believe
That when times are getting tough
I won't see you fall apart
Or go and break my heart

Are you ready for my love?
Are you ready to stand up?
And turn on the lights and
Show me what you've got inside

Are you ready to be brave and never walk away
Can you be wrong, can you be strong no matter what
Are you ready for my love?

I'm ready to give myself completely to you
You, only you, yes, you, only you
And, baby, there's more to come

Are you ready for my love?
Are you ready to stand up?
And turn on the lights and show me what you've got inside

The dance we shared 'neath the stars alone
For a moment all the world was right
How could I have known that you'd ever say goodbye

And now I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance I could have missed the pain
But I'd of had to miss the dance

Holding you I held everything
For a moment wasn't I a king
But if I'd only known how the king would fall
Hey who's to say you know I might have chanced it all

And now I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end the way it all would go

I had a dream of love invisioning you (it was you)
You're all that I need
Some may think that love involves more than two (that ain't true),
At least not with me

And so I give you a minute to think about it
Clear all the doubt from your mind,
Don't waste my time, baby
Don't try to play me, I ain't a baby, I may be young but
I'm wise, and I've got my pride so

If You Don't See what I see
By the time that I count to 3
I'm gonna say bye-bye
I'm giving you 1-2 what ya gonna do?

If You Don't See what I see
How a love is supposed to be I'm gonna say bye-bye, ain't no lie
I'll do without you

Because I need you to be true
I'm giving you..

Who's gonna leave 
And who's gonna stay
How long can this house, two cars and one little girl stand in our way

How long can we keep holding on to something that's already gone girl,
Life's too short to love like this
too tired to try to scared to quit
We took to heart the vows we made
But somehow lost the will
We said I do, but do we still

In the middle of a storm, never touchin' the brake
I drove like a bat outta hell
Down that lonely ol' four lane

With the bright lights of Houston just fadin' behind
My tires tearin' up the road toward the state line
I was leavin' the great Lone Star state
That I loved for good

For the love of a good woman who lives in Louisiana
On a bayou by the river with the moon in her hair
And when I get there, I'm gonna get down on one knee
'Cause wherever she is boy that's home for me
Don't get me wrong

Love's the only reason, I'd ever leave Texas
She's the only reason, I'd ever stay gone

Just about Baton Rouge, I was changin' my mind
Thinkin' 'bout all the things I'd be leavin' behind
Like a Red River sunrise
And the stars on a Galveston night

For the love of a good woman who lives in Louisiana
On a bayou by the river with the moon in her hair
And when I get there, I'm gonna get down on one knee

Love's the only reason, I'd ever leave Texas
An' she's the only reason, I'd ever stay gone

Wonderin' where I'd spend the rest of my life
Gone like an old tumbleweed
Rollin' his way to a place he finally call home

On a bayou by the river with the moon in her hair

Suzy was in pig tails
I know I loved her even then
You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boohooed it
But I told them time and time again
""Don't you know I was made to love her
Built a world all around her""
Yah! Hey, hey, hey
She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years
I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her

All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby. Ah!

My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere
I was knee high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there

Grew up fast, I bought a car
Ain't never had a wife
Lost playa type of cat
I never had a wife (Why?)

Rocko,"I done a lot of good, I done a lot of wrong, dis real shit, I advise u listen to this song. 
A nigga robbed me 15 yrs ago(where)
Back in canridge swats sides on 4, never forget that day, thought it was all g's, but niggas hating man dey hating on a small g.
Stuck me witha shank, left a whole in ma face, took my heroin, bone, money, beeper off my waist. Next day I squad up, got all the
Tools out, got a hot bos, roll round lookin for dudes house, lucky for me I ain't catch him, woulda been dead, unlucky for him
Fucked round, he touched the wrong kid, that karm fool, it hit cha from the blind side, he got shot 9 times now he paraylized,
Plz forgive him lord, even a thug pray, but I pray my past don't come back to haunt me


Told me it was destiny, came to me 1 night I was dreamin, dese crazy visions I kept on seeing, all the money and clothes, all
The drugs that I sold from the life that I chose, but it could be karma, cause all these things u do it could haunt cha, if u do it wrong it come right back
On ya, all the money and clothes, all the drugs that I sold could be the reason u ain't livin tomorrow.

I remember I flexed a nigga for a couple chips, juss being greedy man 
I ain't even need dat shit, country nigga, he know me from a peice of meat,
But I had to do it to him man dat nigga was supa sweet, 
next week u won't believe what happned to me, dem folk came I took a loss on like 400g's, 
dat lil 100 stack cost me 300 strong, but it's my fault because dat shit I did was dead wrong. 
Damn y I do dat shit, dat was supa dumb, too late to cry about it
Now nigga what's done is done, u do bad u get bad, and dats karma buddie, 
it don't matter where u hide, ain't no runnin from it. 
I asked myself have I paid for all this Dirt I done 
or is it gonna catch up wit me before my time is done, 
I'm doin good good now, I can honestly say, 
but I pray my past don't come back to haunt me

Generational curse cause of what my daddy did, wat his daddy did, 
dat shit sound weird, I know the words so I know that ain't right, forgive me lord, 
I'm just Tryin' get my stack right. 
The bible said he said ""for was both life and death"" 
blessings and curses told us choose 4 ourselfs. 
He told us choose life so we can Stay blessed so u and yo kids can have different sets. 
Instead we choose death, you know that curse sign, dat kill a nigga, 
sell dope, u know that dirt sign I'm doin'

Janet babysit her kids
Janet loves them like they're hers
Janet needs a place to live
So Kim let her come live with them
Kim knows her just like her fam
But what Kim don't understand
Is that Janet's not her kin
Janet's not even her friend
Janet's tryna seek revenge
Janet's got a plan
Janet's still holding a grudge from back when her and Kim were ten
She devised a perfect plan
Janet's gon sleep with her man
She lays naked in the kitchen wait for him to come in
He walks in the door like damn
You know a man gon be a man
In the mist of all of that he must forgot about Kim
Kim bust's in on them
Janet stands there with her grin

Michael real cool nigga but he just not getting money (how)
Drought came around
He fixed up niggas for some dummies
Now he ballin like a dog
Every night he in the club
Throwing money, popping bottles, flexing hard
He don't give a fuck
Then one night he met this girl
Finest girl he ever saw
He say I never seen before
She say I'm here from Arkansas
They kicked it off a couple months
She fucked and sucked him like a pole
He say I love your dirty drawers baby I never let you go
Year later they're still together
Now he feeling like he love her
So he let her in his business
Cause he felt like he could trust her
She sitting in the kitchen while he busting down dem bricks
She thumbing through the check
He swear he got a gangster bitch
Well he don't know about this bitch
Cause everything she say a lie
Man this xxxxx ain't who she say she is
This xxxxx is FBI
Man this game a dirty game
Man be well for the tricks

Be sitting in jail about a bitch",Snakes

You'll never know that I still love you

Will never wash away my misery

I'll wait for stormy weather

I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun

Rocky Hernández,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone

Me and Frankie and Jimmy and some Italian guy
We were singing oldies but they were newies then
And today when I play my old 45's I remember when
We practiced in a subway,in a lobby or a hall
Crowded in a doorway singing ""do waps"" to the wall
And if we went to a party and they wouldn't let us sing
We'd lock ourselves in the bathroom and nobody could get in
'Cause we were looking for an echo an answer to our sound
A place to be in harmony a place we almost found ooooh
And the girls would gather 'round us and our heads would really swell
We'd sing songs by the moonglows, the harptones and the dells
And when we sang sincerely, we really sang it high
And even though it was falsetto we almost reached the sky
We've sung a lot of changes since 1955
And a lot of bad arrangements we've tried to harmonise
Now they've turned into oldies but they were newies then
And today when I play my old 45's I remember when

I saw the Martians on the floor a-dancin' to this sound

I'll speak to you of happiness
I'll tell you about a breakwater
But that was long ago I guess
Now I'm on a time schedule
I'm sure you are as well
I don't believe in letters and I never learned to spell either
So you can let on that you knew me the way I needed to be known
The ghost I am, I was long ago
I gave my life to a memory of music
And she just turned her head

I'll tell you how this life was led
So secretly so quietly
I chase around what doesn't exist
Now I'm on a time schedule
I'm sure you are as well
I don't believe in letters and I never learned to spell either

And try to see the hope that you see
And not the vacant and desolate shell of experience reflected in me

A little Greek restaurant where we sat a hundred times before
I reached across the table for your palms

Your palms, your hands in mine
You suddenly felt strong
Strong enough, I guess, to let you go

All of life gets laced, will I ever know that?
Nothing could be harder
Nothing stronger at all

From climbing this high
I set up for the fall

It took nothing more than this clean, crisp mountain breeze
And it took nothing more than this picture of you in my head
To keep me, to keep me from the sleep so badly I needed
To push me, to push me over the edge, over the edge
Into a hole as deep as my regret

What it is to be deceived reminds me of this day
That I could never smoke or drink enough to take away
But like the fool I am that never stopped me from trying
This side of you, it made me feel like dying

It's hard to remember than ever before
One can't forget, there's no better cure

It's better if we don't think about it
It's better if we just close our eyes
It's better if we don't think about it
It's better if we just smile, everyone else does

Think I'll lay down for a while
Get today off my mind
Think I'll lay down for a while
And I'll get today off my mind

All this means one in a million
Wish I could break out of this shell
Looking like everything I hate
So mates, sleep in this cell

On the 1st day that we met
As I hang up your blue pants
Next to mine, we're intertwined
In my closet and I'm reminded of
The greenest eyes that ever burned from behind

Crabtree and Evelyn

Neither could have known the plans that were in store
I'm seeing our home again
You're decorating
The walls with pieces from the waters of your shipwrecked past
Trying to make sense of how two of the darkest lives
Came together to give this world light
A world that's cracking and leaking all around me
I can spend my day knowing my love for my lady
Every song we hear, was written just for you and for me
We can show up late and leave early
I catch a hint of how you smelt
On the 1st day that we met
I feel the aching and yearning of being that you bury in me
The gift of the moment I'm in reminds me of
The greenest eyes that ever burned from behind



",Crabtree and Evelyn
Rocky Votolato,"Blood still flows in my veins today
And I'm walking on the ground
That one day my body will be laid
The ones I loved will gather around
To say a few words
About all I've done with my
Time now that I'm deep in the earth
So I'll go this alone
Though we have always been together
Part of me each of you've become

Keep me walking straight
Narrow let my steps be
It's up early and it's up late
If it's what makes you happy
We are a legacy
Of tragedies but my God willing
I will bring an end to this

Though I may see an early grave
I will make my time here my own
So say a few words
About all I've done with my time
Now that I'm deep in the earth



",Deep in the Earth
Rocky Votolato,"I'm gonna start at the beginning
I'm gonna make something out of nothing
No I don't know anything about Beethoven
But I know that you will always haunt me

You have been brought here
For something so much greater than me
But it's hard cause I'll get all of the attention
When you're work is so much more important
Please don't stop looking at me
Don't walk out on me

I should be singin'
To earn my keep by now
I guess my throat just can't carry the weight
Listen now you can hear the sound of how
It's been blown out

Oh A and see
I know your just an old standby
But you'll help me tonight to get across all I mean
Listen now, please don't walk out on me



",Don't Walk out on Me
Rocky Votolato,"Some things can't be bottled
See how it's draining out the bottom
Just like holding onto water
My eyes will only open for so long

So show me everything
I'm always aching to see
It's not pretty I know
But still this is who I'll always be
I'm learning to trust you enough to take from you
You can trust me too
I have many gifts
That's right my God gave them to me
I've worked hard to learn to use them
And now I'll go and teach

Bothell is beautiful in the fall
Days of my youth were not so long ago
I learned things here that some men never see
The lucky ones know exactly what I mean
I'm learning to trust you enough to take from you
You can trust me too



",Holding Onto Water
Rocky Votolato,"I guess that's it for this boy
He'll never write again
Something tells me I've been here before
And so long to apocalyptic visions in this head
I'm going on to bigger and better things

Cause I'm tired
Like they were tired
Like a Mother, she knows what tired means
At the end of my century

We are all the authors of our own destruction
Help me to take what has been done here
And put this into focus
I've got a vision that's feeding on me
This dirty ambition you see
Call it lack of perception

Problems lie in how we look upon everything
Or is it that we haven't learned to see
That simple vision with two eyes shows us nothing
And nothing's quite the color that it seems

I'm going crazy like they went crazy
Going slowly - no much quicker than you think
At the end of my century



",Like a Mother
Rocky Votolato,"You're in the kitchen, I stare at our bed frame
I'm hearing your voice through the door
I will work my fingers to bones
To find us a way out of here

I buried my past down in Texas
Where I'm from, to live here with you tonight
I know the morning light
Will come like it always does
To tear us apart
But I don't want to think about that right now
I just want to sit here and remember that little beach town
How the screendoor reflected the water
And your eyes in the picture we took
It left me with scars that are there for good

When we hit the bigtime
My darlin' I mean something
Like nothing the worlds ever seen
They'll put us on the Silver Screen
A Silver Lining - with clouds that forgot how to rain
The day we finally escape
Is all I'm thinking about right now
I just want to sit here and remember that little beach town
How the screendoor reflected the water
And your eyes in the picture we took
It left me with scars that are there for good
It burned holes in me that were permanent



",Like Silver
Rocky Votolato,"Everyone will sing songs of lost mothers
Every debt will be paid in the end
Lives lived will be brought back into focus
As each one looses the place where it begins

Please tell them I said I'm sorry
I knew not all that I did
This message carried hopefully will carry
Much more weight than words of men down here

Feel your losses you'll know that it's October
Stretched out short days eat you from within
Lives lived brought back homeward
I'm leaving home again

Please tell me it's not the last time
Though that day awaits keep it far from here
There's still much work we've to get done
Your lighthouse is burning my travels clean



",October
Rocky Votolato,"Never let go those years of discovery
There's only so much a pair of arms can carry
Embrace these years of necessity
Put your mouth around your double edged sword
Your unhappiness is what you are
The same nervousness that makes me good at what I do
Is my enemy today and will be my whole life through
I'll spend it with you
I have climbed a mountain
You've swam in every ocean
You've heard a million songs and never tried to sing
I've read hundreds of books and never wrote anything
I love you -- Just the same




",Swallowing Swords
Rocky Votolato,"Thank you for leading me home that I
May one day return to walk through those fields again
I buried a treasure and made a map
So I'd always find my way back
I guess that don't matter now

Time has had a different effect on you
Look at you you're blue black and through being that kid I knew
Life is rich and ripe with
Thoughts unsung, and songs unheard

I'm telling our stories to myself
I'm trying to make since of me and you
Summertime after our family broke
Was a turning point - so many things there to learn

Time has had a different effect on you
Look at you you're blue black and through being that kid I knew
I hope it's not too late that I
Tell you I love you and I always have



",Treasure Chest
Rocky Votolato,"Everyday has a song
Some get sung while others go unheard
Take a good look around
It'll never be this way again so try to remember
Dylan, Drake, even Schwarzenbach
How you became heroes I'll never forget
It's not easy to look at your heart
Not many men know how and even fewer speak out

So if you know exactly what the sunset looks like
You'll be lucky if you don't loose your eyes

""To Hell with that""
She said ""I'll look deep and hard
It's what my God gave me these eyes for""
I'll look just as hard as her
Hell even harder I'll join her as a miner
Digging deep till I'm blind,
Without eyes still seeing but always singing out



",Without Eyes Still Seeing
Rocky Votolato,"I don't want to fight about who's pulling the weight
Wait for me upstairs I'll be up to rub your neck
I want to be let down and disenchanted
To walk through a cloud of disappointment, help me out
I thought I escaped but the snakes still came
Wrapped around my body tangled up in my ribcage
We just need to find songs we want to hear
The sounds been making my blue eyes go gray all these years

I'm suffocating now
I overdosed somehow on my own medicine
I know all to well
The demons I can't handle
Can hurt the ones I love
If I can hold them off, just long enough
I'll get my mind straight
That ought to hold them off, just long enough
I'll push this down inside

I know if we'd never met I'd be dead by now
I've been fucked up, a nervous wreck as long as I can remember
But you write the story so pick up the pen
Draw me pretty pictures of everything I hope to live

We grew up way too fast
Forget about the past
Nothing can change that now
You'll learn to like the pain
And turn it into something
That everyone else can love
That ought to hold them off, just long enough
I'll get my mind straight
That ought to hold them off, just long enough
I'll push this down inside",Blue and Gray
Rocky Votolato,"All of the healing will take some time
We both have had psychotic men in our lives
And I know that you're right
Deal with it forget sometimes I can't
So I wanna hit somebody with a baseball bat
Break his fucking knees and take pleasure in it
And I know it's not right
Would only hurt you and I
I'll pass the hours thinking about killing you both

For your evil example
You taught me all I need to know
About what I hate most",A Discourse on Killing
Rocky Votolato,"Sometimes you have to be brave
And let things fall where they will

The rain will come
You can't stop that or hurry it up
So bury the guilt
It's not your fault
Everything he did
I don't wanna risk anything
So I'm standing still
I'll be right here when you come to find me
Control is comforting
Maybe I should be running
If I controlled anything I'd be scared of the place that I'd be
I thank you for saving me

When the time is right
I swear my day will come
The sweetest storm will blow through this town and carry us out
So take a look around
And see how it's coming down
To wash you blood and bone from the inside out

I've never been able to crack the code
To break the secret spell
That would open up the door and let me in
To everything I've been looking for so hard I've never seen
But I feel my strength returning tonight
Its flowing from the purest well to ever give water
It spills out into an ocean where the sharks are circling
A carnival of counterfeits has no room for something real

Arrogance and ego wrapped around every word
Shouted from the pulpit as a judgment to control
These were my roots my seed was thrown in shallow soil
I grew into the thorn bushes to be scorched by the sun
But I feel the gravel move beneath my feet
The smell of the gasoline mixed in with the trees
When my faith is strong I know my strength
The threats will be screamed when the vultures fell threatened

So I'll open up the door and let you in
I want to break the alabaster smell the sweet perfume
And when the bottle is broken I'll have nothing left to give

It seemed like a safe enough game
For a man to play with his daughter
An automatic rifle and a bullet through the window
And the troops are satisfied that justice had been delivered

That was enough to set the spark of a vision in another
Eighteen years, eighteen year old girl, to see herself a martyr
To keep up with the cycle
Of an automatic rifle and a bullet through the window
And the troops were satisfied that justice had been delivered

In the full glory of the passions that you found here
Than to fade and wither with age
From watching the flickering light dim in the eyes of the living.

These silly ideas that waste more time than I had to
Loose when I woke up this morning 

Seems like I've
Got so much more to loose now than I ever had before
Little beanie-bean with the calculator keys 
Can he add

It all up, make it all make sense to me 
I've got no idea
How much more time 
I've got left if I can't get my mind

Right 
The simplest little melody has got me all tangled up
In knots 
We can go and walk in the morning 

We don't
Need streetlights just a new start 
Not paralyzed by
Appearances with big ideas and just way to smart

To walk around on the surface when there's an ocean
Just beneath it's blue-green smile 
All the while nothing
Stopping me from jumping in and sinking fast 

I'll sing
You to sleep first",Streetlights
Rocky Votolato,"Come dry me out 
'Cause I've been drinking all night
Before I pass out I need your ghost to tell me this bloodless voice
Is as meaningless as it sounds 

Hard fought for some spare time
To sit around and search for something I ain't never gonna find
Colors fade in the night sky 
Lightning bugs are flashing on the

Front porch no it's in my head 
To take me back to another time
'Cause once its gone it's just something you ain't never gonna find
No matter how hard you try 

There's no reason to stop it and you
Couldn't if you wanted now 
Come dry me out 
Just not with your

Fist I'm not looking for a fight

Gonna find

Take these cities from me I'll build buildings up with my own

In rows on the side of the road

To kill the joy of wondering and end all their desire

To help them to remember that the road is nothing but a liar

Rocky Votolato,"If I asked real sweet, would you take a ride with me?
Drive down streets that no one else has ever seen
Red bucket seats with a stereo from 1953

I knew you before you were born
And I've seen an ending worth waiting for
Under blankets and maps to keep us warm

Mile markers made out of rows of white birch trees
Lead me to black velvet dressed in silver rings
Just like you and me some things are meant to be

I knew you before you were born
And I've seen an ending worth waiting for
Under blankets and maps to keep us warm, keep us warm

The paper moon in the tree branch blue sky
Is cold and brittle on an October night
Dead weather vines that grew on concrete steam lamp lights

I knew you before you were born
And I've seen an ending worth waiting for
Under blankets and maps to keep us warm, keep us warm
Keep us warm, keep us warm

",Before You Were Born
Rocky Votolato,"Christmas parties and all night fights
I remember you sweet-talking to me beneath the strung up lights
Those days are gone now I know I had everything to do with that
'Cause I've never been afraid of dying, never done much to avoid it
These memories still keep me up at night

On my way back from a place, no recovery
And I'm bleeding on my knuckles again, fighting in a fight I can't win
Broken teeth and broken nose and ten years at the bottom of a bottle
Will you help me find my way back home?

The halls in this place you can hear 'em scream
'Cause they had to watch and listen to the people
And the voices of what they'd seen
I can't hear anything and all I can see is a memory of your smile
Your necklace, pistol locket on a silver chain
Hold on too tight, you'll lose everything

On my way back from a place, no recovery
And I'm bleeding on my knuckles again, fighting in a fight I can't win
Broken teeth and broken nose and ten years at the bottom of a bottle
Will you help me find my way back home?

",Lilly White
Rocky Votolato,"All the possibilities
Things you can pick up and look beneath
Just watch your step
Don't fall between the blanks in your memories

There's an anchor sinking in the sound
Of a sense of lack that follows you around
Years went by but I know
It don't matter what you think of me

I'm awake, don't let me go back to sleep
Like a fugitive who just quit running
You found out there's no escape

Some mistakes can't be undone
It'll never be like it was
And wishing for it only makes it worse

There's some demons waiting down South
Some kind of confederate ghost that holds me close
Shows me the way to go until I'm sure I'm lost

I built a workshop to find myself
Where I can dig in the corners climbing spider webs
It's a Polaroid cemetery of every look you've ever given me

I'm awake, don't let me go back to sleep
Like a fugitive who just quit running
You found out there's no escape

Some mistakes can't be undone
It'll never be like it was
And wishing for it only makes it worse

Keep on writing to capture a feeling
It's an outline of a real connection
Treat your desires as what they are
Imposter's and a lonely invitation

Some mistakes can't be undone
It'll never be like it was
And wishing for it only makes it worse

",Red Dragon Wishes
Rocky Votolato,"I hear you call me, branches break in the wind
And through the leaves and concrete
You're gonna grow into something that death can't steal

A garden that gives, sprouts come up glowing
Fruits of jade and golden, silver trees to mark the legacy
Of a life that finally learned what this means

The invisible choir sings you a voiceless lesson
So you'll always remember what grew out of decisions
That death can't steal, lives that learned to give

When it seemed there was nothing
Oh, how much more it meant to those
Around we go there's a rhythm soft and slow
You'll always hear the choir if you listen close

Rocky Votolato,"Time is a debt, son, the world has always owed
But not anymore, I found out how to beat it
It's the water in a river, you can't keep your head above
But not anymore, I found out all its secrets

You didn't know who's hiding in your eyes
The highs are the ice in the branches on a mountain top
You didn't know who's hiding in your smile
The lows are the devil's tears, rain falling in the sunlight

Time is a debt, son, it's something you can't call your own
But not anymore I found out how to keep it
Who I used to be is just a sea of evenings
Now I'm the morning light that will always keep you from sleeping

You didn't know who's hiding in your smile

",Time Is a Debt
Rocky Votolato,"The moonlight is shining down
Through the factories on the shipyard waters
And in a winter midnight Sideways moon sets
On the memory of what's gone missing

The sidewalk stares up silent
I'm just a shadow slowly disappearing
A ghost of something real that used to exist
A memory of what's gone missing

Why do you keep running?
The pace is hurried but you're never closer
To what it was you thought you wanted
It all keeps changing, now something else is missing
Who knows where?

I knew our time was running out
So by the kitchen window back at your house
I ended up wasted on whiskey straight
And filled the ashtray up with your secrets

You were an anchor with high cheekbones
I was a soldier with broken fingers
You ended up wasted on cheap champagne
Celebrating everything that's missing

Why do you keep running
The pace is hurried but you're never closer
To what it was you thought you wanted
It all keeps changing and now something else is missing

Familiar madness
It all keeps changing and now something else is missing
Hey, yeah

",Whiskey Straight
Rocky Votolato,"That smoke, it moves just like sweet velvet
It lures me in till I'm drinking to kill the pain
Trying to stay out of a fight but the liquor, it won't let me
The only thing it's killing now is me

Your darkest eyes and pale skin are always on me
Black fingernail polish is chipping off again
On my mind just like a death threat or maybe death wish
Kill me anytime I'm ready for it

No one else was ever half this beautiful
No two hearts were ever half what ours was whole, whole
Desperate like the rain on your midnight window sill
You said I love you and I know that's what you meant
I know that's what you meant

There's a Holy Grail of a simple life led somewhere
In the blankets of trees between you and Tennessee
St. Peter's in a river running out to Homer's sea
Where the leaves can break your heart
And the waves might wash me clean

No one else was ever half this beautiful
No two hearts were ever half what ours was whole, whole
Desperate like the rain on your midnight window sill
You said I love you and I know that's what you meant
Hey, I know that's what you meant

Every night it's all the same
. I close my eyes, my thoughts collide,
I dream you're here with me.
Although I don't know everything,
I know that I'll stay true
In all the things we've said and done.
I did it all for you.

Broken hearts, broken ties,
Lost and healed inside your eyes.
Holding on there is no other place
I'd rather be tonight.

All these things rearranged,
But nothing's ever gonna change my mind. 
We'll always have next summer.

Looking out my window,
Another night and you're away. 
Find a warm place in your heart, 
Winter's on its way.
Everyone is afraid to see 
The truth that lies inside of me. 
Everyone's afraid to think, afraid to fall.

Walk across the shallow streams 
And try to cast the line to save your sinking story 
Because your story's full of holes and lies.
You'll drowned tonight.
All the dreams we left behind
And all the things we never tried 
And all that's trapped inside of me
Where hearts converge and hearts collide.
""Life is but an endless dream""
Of childhood and make believe.

In fear you would ever cross me.

They lived beneath the Moorish lord

I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.
Hoping and prayin' for 
Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
Maybe, I'm searching though I don't succeed,
but someone look, there's a growing need.
Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning;
all that's left is an unhappy ending.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
I'll be searching ev'rywhere just find someone to care.
I'll be looking ev'ry day;
I know I'm gonna find a way.
Nothing's gonna stop me now;
I'll find a way some how.
I'll be searching ev'rywhere just find someone to care.

In the key that our souls were singing.

Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day

Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love,
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

Now December found the love that we shared in September.
Only blue talk and love,
Remember the true love we share today

I hear her [KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK] on my door

When there is nobody else around 
She kisses me and she holds me tight 
And tells me,  ""Daddy, everything's all right"" 
That's why I know, yes, I know

And the clouds are so low
You can touch them, and so
Come out to the meadow, Jean
Jean, Jean, you're young and alive
Come out of your half-dreamed dream
And run, if you will, to the top of the hill
Open your arms, bonnie Jean
Till the sheep in the valley come home my way
Till the stars fall around me and find me alone
When the sun comes a-singin' I'll still be waitin'

Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in a summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
When the day was young and the night was long
And the moon stood still for the nightbird's song
If you go away

You must tell the world to stop turning till
You return again, if you ever do

Can I tell you now as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly 'til your next hello
Ne me quitte pas

If you go away

But if you stay I'll make you a night like no night has been or will be again

It's either a blessing or a curse
Although I cannot offer solutions
It would be reckless of me to try
'Cause it's mystified man ever since time began

It can pierce the coldest heart
Love is warm, love is patient
And the craziest thing you'll ever start

A day I'm never allowed to forget
There was a girl that I met who I dreamed I would wed
Forever our lives entwined
She said you gotta stop worrying about the future
You know we're far too young for that
I wanna spread my wings like a willow in the spring

Love is life, love is yearning
It does not boast, but speaks the truth
Love is fair and knows no boundaries
And the craziest thing you'll ever do
Oh, yeah

I wish you well in all of your travels
And may you find what you're searching for
It'll hit you like thunder when you find one another
And stay in your heart forevermore

Down my street weren't too playful
And right then it seemed like the whole world picked on me

Stretchin' hide for a boot man in Jersey Town

Seems like a long time, seems like a long, long time

You know it makes me sad
Seems like a long time, seems like a long time
Seems like a long, long time
Yes it does,long,long,time, yes it does, long,long time

War time is only the other side of peace time
But if you've ever seen how wars are won
You know what it's like to wish peace time would come
And don't it seem like a long time
Seem like a long time, seems like a long, long time",Seems Like a Long Time
Rod Stewart,"Fare the well my brother, please don't stand in my way
I'm going down to that dirty town
No matter what you say
You fooled me and you ruled me, and you played in every part
I gotta go, it's no use me stayin' home

Goodbye my sister, please don't let me see you cry
Gonna be a star some day, no matter what they say
And when you hear the crowds, all callin' and shouting out my name
Until then, my little friend, I'll be unsatisfied

So long sweet Melinda, don't forget that you're my girl
Gonna dress you fine, and if you give me time
Make you proud like I said I would
And if the Champs Elysee's no fallacy, if I find the world looks like it should
Candy cars, movie stars, street bars, then I could stay a while

Well I love you
Shall I write or phone from Paris or Rome
And I'll miss you all
Even tho' you're tryin' to hold me back

Farewell all my family, don't you know I mean you so well
Please appreciate I must make a break
Just to see what I can do
The stage is set so understand, I can't hide in the wings no more
I've got to go now it's no use me staying home

All I can say is I love you
Shall I write or phone from Paris or Rome
And I think I'm always gonna miss you
And I love you always
I think I'm always gonna miss ya
Even tho' you're tryin' to hold me back

And I love you and I miss you
If you don't get no mail you know I'm in jail
If you don't get no mail you know I'm in jail
But I love you and I miss you",Farewell
Rod Stewart,"Went downtown on the two forty-nine,
Playin' for recognition of the New York town.
See, me and the boys got a rock 'n' roll band,
They were so damn good, gonna lift up the man.

Well, we got ups, we got downs,
We got just so high 'til the sun goes down.
Got the ego, can be abused,
I got my two-toned shoes,
And I can sing the blues.

[Chorus:]
Look out, kids, it's the F. B. I.
We got a problem, you keep me high.
Put on your clothes, take the smile off your face
And put your money where your mouth is or get out this place.

New York town is a meanass town,
We got a thousand bands singin' underground.
Way down in New Orleans it's the same old thing,
Emotional music, a merry old thing.

Old King Soul, he finally gave us a jolt,
He played the vibes 'til nine and read from ten to four.
He played upside down, he played inside out,
Then a uniform band he was thrown into jail.

[Chorus]

Gettin' hungry I know little woman,
Can't get a smell 'cause my nose is blocked.
I'm so high, I can't believe it,
Hotel dogs are knockin' on my door.

Two night of singin' nearly out on the end,
Left the two parts red, oh what a square.
As soon as the man, there's no sweeter song,
Listen, McCartney, we're the band on the run.

[Chorus]

Oh yeah.",All in the Name of Rock 'n' Roll
Rod Stewart,"Oh, didn't I mess around like everybody did?
I said, "" Woman, you're foolin' around with a man that just don't fit.""
I said, ""I'd better get along before I get right under your skin.""
Remember the song, wasn't it fun, 'cause it was just one of those things.

But it was alright for an hour; it was alright for a day.
But it did not last, it did not last till the weekend,
And I packed my bags and moved right away.

I said goodbye to money, I don't owe no alimony.
I paid my dues and payroll cues, gonna leave it all up to you.
I'll take my dog and my car, the best friends I've found so far,
And I'll keep goin' with the mornin' sun, singin' the same old song.

But it was alright for an hour; it was alright for a day.
But it did not last, it did not last till the weekend,
And I packed my bags and moved right away.

Well I guess you needed somebody to open each and every door
With a large amount in the Swiss account to give you thrills and nothing more.
But my Volkswagen is hardly a custom built Ferarri.
You want first class but I pump gas, so I'll get on out of your way.

But it was alright for an hour; it was alright for a day.
But it did not last, it did not last till the weekend,
And I packed my bags and moved right away.
It was alright for an hour; it was alright for a day.
But it did not last, it did not last till the weekend,
And I packed my bags and moved right away.",Alright for an Hour
Rod Stewart,"Day after day I'm more confused;
I look for the light in the pouring rain.
You know that's a game that I hate to lose.
I'm feelin' the strain; ain't it a shame?

Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul;
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away.
Give me the beat, boys, to soothe my soul;
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away.

Beginning to think that I'm wastin' time;
Don't understand the things that I do.
Cause the world outside looks so unkind.
Now I'm countin' on you to carry me through.

Oh, give me the beat, boys, to soothe my soul;
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away.
Yeah, give me the beat, boys, to soothe my soul;
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away.

And when my mind is free no melody can move me.
When I'm feelin' blue guitars are comin' through to soothe me.

And thanks for the joy that you've given me;
I want you to know I believe in your song,
And rhythm and rhyme and harmony.
You help me along, makin' me strong.

Give me the beat, boys, to soothe my soul;
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away, yeah
Give me the beat, boys, to soothe my soul;
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away.

Oh, give me the beat, boys, to soothe my soul;
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away,

I don't have to tell you what a welcome it will be.
I felt the light before but I let it slip away,
But I still keep on believing that it'll come back some day.

It's not the street lights of some old street of dreams.
It ain't the moonlight, not even the sunlight,
But I've seen it shining in your eyes and you know what I mean.

Some times I try to tell myself the light was never real,
Just a fantasy that used to be, the way I used to feel.

First encounter, hardly the best.

But I would not change a thing
If I could do it all over again.

Didn't I try to impress you,

And my one room over the drugstore,
We watched the neon lights go out over town.

And some nights we'd go out dancin',
Come home singin' by the Erie Canal.

Rod Stewart,"Ever since I was a kid in school
I messed around with all the rules
Apologized, then realized
I'm not different after all

Me and the boys thought we had is sussed
Valentino's all of us
My dad said we looked ridiculous
But, boy, we broke some hearts

In and out of jobs, running free
Waging war with society
Dumb, blank faces stared back at me
But nothing ever changed

Promises made in the heat of night
Creepin' home before it got too light
I wasted all that precious time
And blamed it on the wine

I was only joking, my dear
Looking for a way to hide my fear
What kind of fool was I?
I could never win

Never found a compromise
Collected lovers like butterflies
Illusions of that grand first prize
Are slowly wearin' thin
Susie, baby, you were good to me
Giving love unselfishly
But you took it all too seriously
I guess it had to end

I was only joking, my dear
Looking for a way to hide my fear
What kind of fool was I?
I could never win

Now you ask me if I'm sincere
That's the question that I always fear
Verse seven is never clear
But I'll tell you what you want to hear
I try to give you all you want
But giving love is not my strongest point
If that's the case, it's pointless going on
I'd rather be alone

'Cause what I'm doing must be wrong
Pouring my heart out in a song
Owning up for prosperity
For the whole damn world to see

Quietly now while I turn a page
Act one is over without costume change
The principal would like to leave the stage
The crowd don't understand",I Was Only Joking

Pleading with me to take you back

I thought I had seen everything
Obviously I was wrong

Cause where were you when the sun went down
Skies turned dark and gray
Where were you when the north winds blew
Honey tell me where were you

I heard you were living down in Brazil
With them high class friends of mine
I can't believe I was so naive
Did I never once cross your mind

You told them all I was down and out
My existence you even denied
Oh what pleasure it gives me now
To know that you're bleeding inside

You were every move I ever made

Or on the corner with the rest of the boys
You and I were just a breath away
It was great while it lasted
But oh Lord it turned nasty
You didn't give me one chance to explain
Well is that all the thanks I get

Is that the thanks I get
Is that the thanks I get
Is that the thanks I get for loving you
Is that the thanks I get

Rod Stewart,"Sipping a sangria with a girl named Julia 
Hot Jamaican sand beneath our feet
She purred like a cat in a Panama hat
She said my passport picture was unique
I said I did impersonations would you like to see 
Turned around to buy her one more round

Then suddenly she disappeared 
Like I feared with another guy
Love always seems to let me down
Can be found anywhere around

The carnival had passed 
And my heart was beating fast
All these married women, it ain't fair
Nervously I said would you like to come to bed
A cold silence pierced the evening air
Instantly she recognized my insecurities
Changing subjects quickly I agreed

Then suddenly she disappeared 
Like I feared with another guy, oo baby
Love always seems to let me down
Can be found anywhere around
Nowhere around

The tourist had all gone, winter's coming on
The hotel chambermaid didn't seem to care
Sharing a pina colada we broke into laughter
I'll never know how we made it up the stairs
We spent the night together 
And she woke up in my arms
Kissed me tenderly and said goodbye

Then suddenly she disappeared 
Like I feared with another guy, oo baby
Love always seems to let me down
Can be found anywhere around
Nowhere around

Love always seems to let me down 
Maybe I'll wait until next year, next year, next year",Last Summer
Rod Stewart,"Started out like any one of you
Good intentions and a degree
But one hot night under the neon lights
Killed a boy just seventeen

Now I sit here rainin' on my Maker
Reprieve is all I'm praying for
Lord I fear the hangman's steps approachin'
Will the priest knock gently on my door

And I know I've let my daddy down
And I broke my mother's heart
I'd give anything turn back time again
Just give me one more start

I don't need no trial humiliation
Just tell me that I'm heaven bound
I don't want no two faced consolation
What use is that to me six feet underground

I'm going down to the engine shed
Put a gun up to my head
Blow myself into the promised land
We call it scarred and scared
And if you ever see my son again
Don't let on just how I fared
Tell him, tell him I went down big and strong
I was never, never, never scarred or scared

All the girls that once did gather 'round me 
Have moved along to someone else
Sitting here desperation is my close friend
What I'd give to kiss one of them now
Oo yeah I'll take you there 
I'll take ya there",Scarred and Scared
Rod Stewart,"Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm just waitin' for the heartaches to come

I want to run but there's no place to go
'Cause heartaches will follow me I know
Without your love the love I need
It's the beginning of the end for me

'Cause you've taking away
All my reason for living
When you pushed aside
All the love I been giving

Didn't I treat you right now, baby, didn't I?
Didn't I do the best for you now, didn't I?
Don't you leave me

Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come

All alone I'm destined to be
With misery my only company
Might come today, might come tomorrow
But it's for sure I ain't got nothing but sorrow

Now don't your conscience
Kind of bother you
How can you watch me cry
After all I done for you, now hold on a minute

Didn't I treat you right now, honey, didn't I?
Didn't I do the best for you now, didn't I?

How can you watch me cry
After all the things I done for you

Didn't I treat you right now, baby, didn't I?
Didn't I do the best for you, couldn't I?
Didn't I do right by you, didn't I?
Didn't I screw you right now?

Kept you in luxury, didn't I?
Didn't I do the best for you, didn't I?
Didn't I treat you right now, didn't I?
Didn't I do the best for you now, didn't I?

I'm trying hard not to cry
You know my crying ain't gonna help me now
Without your love, the love that I need
It's the beginning of the end for me
So don't you leave me

Ooh
Ooh
She sits alone, waiting for suggestions
He's so nervous, avoiding all the questions
His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking?

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so (tell me so, babe)

He's acting shy, looking for an answer
Come on, honey, let's spend the night together
Now, hold on a minute before we go much further
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother
They catch a cab to his high-rise apartment
At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, honey tell me so
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, sugar let me know

His heart's beating like a drum
'Cause at last he's got this girl home
Relax, baby, now we're all alone

They wake at dawn, 'cause all the birds are singing
Two total strangers, but that ain't what they're thinking
Outside it's cold, misty, and it's raining
They got each other, neither one's complaining
He says, I'm sorry, but I'm out of milk and coffee
Never mind, sugar, we can watch the early movie

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me

Well, you can love me tonight if you want
But in the morning make sure you're gone

Hot legs, you're wearin' me out
Hot legs, you can scream and shout
Hot legs, are you still in school?
I love you honey

You got a most persuasive tongue
You promise all kinds of fun
But what you don't understand, I'm a working man
I'm gonna need a shot of vitamin E
By the time you're finished with me
I'm talkin' to you
Hot legs, you're an alley cat

In your jet black suspender belt
Seventeen years old,
He's trudging sixty four
You got legs right up to your neck

Rod Stewart,"Oh yeah
In these days of changing ways
So called liberated days
A story comes to mind of a friend of mine

Georgie boy was gay I guess
Nothin' more or nothin' less
The kindest guy I ever knew

His mother's tears fell in vain
The afternoon George tried to explain
That he needed love like all the rest

Pa said there must be a mistake
How can my son not be straight
After all I've said and done for him

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

Leavin' home on a Greyhound bus
Cast out by the ones he loves
A victim of these gay days it seems

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

Georgie went to New York town
Where he quickly settled down
And soon became the toast of the great white way

Accepted by Manhattan's elite
In all the places that were chic
No party was complete without George

Along the boulevards he'd cruise
And all the old queens blew a fuse
Everybody loved Georgie boy

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

The last time I saw George alive
Was in the summer of seventy-five
He said he was in love I said I'm pleased

George attended the opening night
Of another Broadway hype
But split before the final curtain fell

Deciding to take a short cut home
Arm in arm they meant no wrong
A gentle breeze blew down fifth avenue

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

Out of a darkened side street came
A New Jersey gang with just one aim
To roll some innocent passer-by
There ensued a fearful fight
Screams rang out in the night
Georgie's head hit a sidewalk cornerstone

A leather kid, a switchblade knife
He did not intend to take his life
He just pushed his luck a little too far that night

The sight of blood dispersed the gang
A crowd gathered, the police came
An ambulance screamed to a halt on fifty-third and third

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

Georgie's life ended there
But I ask who really cares
George once said to me and I quote

He said ""never wait or hesitate
Get in kid, before it's too late
You may never get another chance
'Cause youth a mask but it don't last
Live it long and live it fast""
Georgie was a friend of mine

Don't go away

Stay away from my back door too

Kick off your shoes and sit right down
Loosen off that pretty French gown

Tonight's the night
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I love you girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now

Spread your wings and let me come inside 'cause

It's gonna be alright

Rod Stewart,"I didn't know what day it was
When you walked into the room
I said hello unnoticed
You said goodbye too soon

Breezing through the clientele
Spinning yarns that were so lyrical
I really must confess right here
The attraction was purely physical

I took all those habits of yours
That in the beginning were hard to accept
Your fashion sense, Beardsley prints
I put down to experience

The big bossed lady with the Dutch accent
Who tried to change my point of view
Her ad lib lines were well rehearsed
But my heart cried out for you

You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul

My love for you is immeasurable
My respect for you immense
You're ageless, timeless, lace and fineness
You're beauty and elegance

You're a rhapsody, a comedy
You're a symphony and a play
You're every love song ever written
But honey what do you see in me

You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul

You're an essay in glamor
Please pardon the grammar
But you're every schoolboy's dream
You're Celtic, United, but baby I've decided
You're the best team I've ever seen

And there have been many affairs
Many times I've thought to leave
But I bite my lip and turn around
'Cause you're the warmest thing I've ever found

You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend

Tonight I felt like suicide
Roll them dice and pour the wine
Shuffle them cards and deal them fine
Got nobody to kiss tonight

want to be silly and sing and shout
Gotta get legless and fall about
Turn the music up nice and loud
Cheer me up don't bring me down

And she owned a flood lit villa
A little aways from the main highway
Oh take me way down yonder

She was tall, thin and tarty
And she drove a Maserati

In my army surplus jeep
Was I being too bold
Before the night could get old
No, no, no, no

In front of your eyes, just to get you tied

I'm gonna have to leave a little bit sooner

Got to get me some South America sun

Honey don't even ask me if you can come along
Down at the border you need to be older
And you sure don't look like my daughter
Your ridiculous age, start a state outrage
And I'll end up in a Mexican jail
Darling please don't cry you know I wouldn't tell you no lie

Look over there
Oh my God don't look now
But it appears to be raining again
Get upstairs pack my book of prayers
Honey hurry I'm catching pneumonia
I gotta move while I'm in the mood
Or I'll disappear into that wall
Darling please don't curse
It really couldn't be any worse
Say I'm a sun fanatic but it's dark in your attic
And your cat sleeps over my head

I know I'm not a football star
But I want to little better than that
So I'm much obliged for the pure white ride
And a cup of tea every morning
I'll say goodbye, look your man in the eye
You know I wouldn't tell you no lie

If the mandolin wind couldn't change a thing
Then I know I love ya

Oh the snow fell without a break
Buffalo died in the frozen fields you know
Through the coldest winter in almost fourteen years
I couldn't believe you kept a smile
Now I can rest assured knowing that we've seen the worst
And I know I love ya

Oh I never was good with romantic words
So the next few lines come really hard
Don't have much but what I've got is yours
Except of course my steel guitar
Ha, 'cause I know you don't play
But I'll teach you one day
Because I love ya

I recall the night we knelt and prayed
Noticing your face was thin and pale
I found it hard to hide my tears
I felt ashamed I felt I'd let you down
No mandolin wind couldn't change a thing
Couldn't change a thing no, no

The coldest winter in almost fourteen years
Could never, never change your mind

And I love ya
Yes indeed and I love ya
And I love ya
Lord I love ya
And I love ya
And I love ya",Mandolin Wind
Rod Stewart,"Ever since I was a young boy,
I played the silver ball;
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played 'em all.
But I ain't seen nothin' like him
In any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb an' blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feelin' all the bumpers
Always playin' clean.
Plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.
That deaf, dumb an' blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard
There has to be a twist,
A pinball wizard,
Not such a supple wrist.

How do you think he does it?
What makes him so good?
Ain't got no distractions,
Can't hear those buzzes and bells,
Don't see lights a-flashin'
plays by sense of smell.
Always gets a replay,
Never tilts at all
That deaf, dumb an' blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball.

Even my usual table,
He can beat my best,
His disciples lead him in
And he just does the rest.
He's got crazy flipper' fingers,
Never seen him fall.
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball.",Pinball Wizard
Rod Stewart,"You ain't gonna get me honey no way
Tearing down the highway in the pouring rain
Escaping from my wedding day
I heard the bells ringing in the local church 
The ceremony's nearly under way
Telegrams came and the cheap champagne 
Was driving everybody out of their brains
But I convinced my best friends I lost my nerve 
And I pleaded I was being framed

""Sailor show me which way to go"" 
I screamed out loud
""Sailor show me which way to go""

Such a deadly silence 
Due to my defiance 
The wedding ground to a halt
Said I changed my mind
Ain't no use in your trying
So her brother punched me in the throat
Her mother got hysterical
The bitch was cynical 
Father's in the corner drunk
Picking myself off the floor 
I ran to the door
Damned if I was skippin' on my way

""Sailor show me which way to go""
You should have heard the noise
Said ""Sailor show me which way to go""

So keep clean girlie 
Find a man that's truly 
Gonna love you from dusk till dawn
Keep your front door key 
Don't give him up for me 
'Cause tomorrow I may be gone
You see, your wouldbe keepers
All night creepin'
Nobody gonna change in there
Who thinks a marriage life should be like a dog's life
So let's renew it when the year runs out

Sailor show me which way to go
Sailor show me which way to go

She had a belly full of lust but she had no bust",Sailor
Rod Stewart,"Angel came down from heaven yesterday
Stayed with me long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea
Then she spread her wings high over me
She said she's goin' now, come back tomorrow

And I said, Fly on my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side

Fly away, high away, fly away

Sure enough this morning came unto me
Silver wings silhouetted against a child's sunrise
And my angel she said unto me
Today's the day for you to rise
Take my hand, you're gonna be my man, you're gonna rise
Then she took me high over yonder

And I said, Fly on my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Forever I will be by your side

Fly on my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Forever I will be by your side

Fly away, come back another day",Angel
Rod Stewart,"When my friends told me you had someone new,
I didn't believe a single word was true.
I told them all I had faith in you.
I kept a-right on sayin'
Oh, no, not my baby,
Oh no, not my sweet baby.
You're not like all those other girls
Who play with the men hearts like they were toys.
My mama told me; ""Son, when rumors spread
That there is truth somewhere, and you should use your head.""
But I sure didn't listen to what she said, don't you know
I kept a-right on sayin'
Oh, no, not my baby,
Oh no, not my sweet baby.
You're not like all those other girls
Who lead you on and
Tell you lies
No, no.","Oh No, Not My Baby"
Rod Stewart,"If loving you is wrong I don't want to be right
If being right means being without you
I'd rather live a wrong doing life
Your mama and daddy say it's a shame
It's a downright disgrace
Long as I got you by my side
I don't care what your people say

Your friends tell you there's no future
In loving a married man
If I can't see you when I want to
I'll see you when I can
If loving you is wrong I don't want to be right
If loving you is wrong I don't want to be right

Am I wrong to fall so deeply in love with you
Knowing I got a wife and two little children
Depending on me too
And am I wrong to hunger
For the gentleness of your touch
Knowing I got somebody else at home
Who needs me just as much

And are you wrong to fall in love
With a married man
And am I wrong trying to hold on
To the best thing I ever had
If loving you is wrong I don't want to be right
If loving you is wrong I don't want to be right

Are you wrong to give your love
To a married man
And am I wrong trying to hold on
To the best thing I ever had
If loving you is wrong I don't want to be right
If loving you is wrong I don't want to be right

I don't want to be right
If it means sleeping alone at night
I don't want to be right
If it means coming home at night
I don't want to, I don't want to
I don't want to never, never, never be right",(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right

Does he hypnotize you with things I can't afford,
Does he drive a Cadillac, is he white or is he black,
What's he got that I ain't got, is he really that big?
You bet your life I'm jealous babe,
Yeah,

You've been seen wit him all over town, baby
Yes, I'm jealous, goddam' jealous

Did he really blow your mind,
Did he alway treat you kind,
Does he kiss you like I do,
Did he crawl all over you,
Did he have you on the floor,
Were you screaming out for more,
Is he better than I am,
Are you seeing him again.

Tonight as I stand inside the rain.
Ev'rybody knows
That baby's got new clothes,
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls.

She takes just like a woman,
She makes love just like a woman,
And she aches just like a woman.
But she breaks just like a little girl.

Queen Mary, she's my friend,
Oh I believe that I'll go see her again.
Nobody has to guess
That baby can't be blessed
Till she finds out she's like all the rest,
With her fog, her amphetamines and her pearls.

She aches just like a woman, yes she does
She takes just like a woman, yes she does
She makes love just like a woman, yes she does
But she breaks just like a little girl.

It was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst,
So I came in here.
And your long time curse a' hurts,
But you know honey what's worse
Is this pain in here,
I can't stay in here,
Ain't it clear.

Oh I just don't fit,
I believe that it's time for us to quit.
When we meet again
And introduced as friends
Please don't let on
That you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world.

And make love just like a woman, yes she does

Rod Stewart,"It's obvious darlin'
You've become allergic to me
Are my trousers to wide?
Do I drink and get mean?

Is my demeanor that embarrassing?
Are my jokes obsolete?
Or is it my sweat
That's no longer sweet?

I work hard in the factory
To keep you in luxury
To which you've grown accustomed
And you love

Lately you don't light my fuse
Is my fan belt coming loose
Punch me in the Bible
Baby please

Move me, move me
Move me when I'm home

Sometimes baby
I awake in the night
I reach out to touch you
But I'm scared you might bite

A little emotion
Wouldn't be out of place
Wake up and love me
Put a smile on my face

Otis Redding said it best
""Try a little tenderness""
Aretha wanted more
?Respect""

Give me just a little touch
That ain't really asking much
Your dog gets more attention
Than I do

Move me, move me
Move me when I'm home

Sometimes I wonder
If you'll miss me at all
Emotionally independent
As hard as a wall

You're so wrapped up
In your own little world
Your old time religion
Is your lunch with the girls

When I'm standing next to you
Even in a crowd
I might as well be
On another planet

Tell me what I've done to you
To justify this ridicule
If it's over
Why don't we forget it?

Move me, move me
(Soothe me, rock me)
Move me when I'm home
Why don't you move me, move me
(Love me, rock me)
Move me when I'm home?

Why don't you rock me, love me

Rod Stewart,"I gave trust like an innocent kid
I believed everything you said
A parasite that fed on doubt
Yeah it's you that I'm talking about

You rode heavy on my fame
Then you scandalized my name
You robbed me blind with a [incomprehensible]
You lacerated your closest friend

I don't know how you sleep
At night with your conscience
Do they still kiss your feet
And is life as sweet in my absence?

I'm ready now
Ready now for what I gotta give
I'm ready now
Ready now for how I want to live

I don't want no sweet revenge
It'll come and get you in the end
Laugh now while the truth's unknown
'Cause pretty soon it'll be my turn

One of these days and it won't be long
I will find you
Lock up your gates
You'll need all of your snakes to defend you

I'm ready now
Ready now for what I gotta give
I'm ready now
Ready now for how I want to live

I'm bitter now but wait and see
You ain't heard the last of me
I'll dance on your grave
When they finally put you away

What'd I do to deserve
All this evil attention
A thousand years
Will never buy you redemption

Are you ready now
Ready now for what you gotta give?
Are you ready, ready
Ready now?",Ready Now
Rod Stewart,"It's a common misconception
About a man's role in this world
A provider and survivor and
A winner who must never fail

But oh, how he needs a woman
To reassure and give him strength
Through the darkest nights and the hardest fights
When there's no other corner left

When the world outside is threatenin'
And all his dreams have been destroyed
Take him in your arms watch all his guards
Melt like a little boy

Tell him, you really need him
Tell him, you really care
Tell him, you'll never leave him
He'll be satisfied

And he may not find it easy
To say what's on his mind
When he's full of doubt, say, ""We'll work it out""
God knows how hard he's trying

And he may never buy you roses
And forget to notice your hair
But as long as he says, ""I love you my dear""
That's all you need to hear

Tell him, you really need him
Tell him, you'll aways care
Tell him, you'll never leave him
He'll be satisfied

And they say, the heart's a hunter
But it's truth you can't deny
He may never be everything you want
But for you, he'd lay down and die

So Friday night when the phone rings
And he's stuck in a downtown bar
Roll away the stone 'cause the last mile home
Is the longest mile of them all

Tell him, you really need him
Tell him, you'll always care
Tell him, you'll never leave him
He'll be satisfied

Tell him, you really want him
Tell him, you understand
And tell him that you love him
He'll be satisfied",Satisfied
Rod Stewart,"Here we go babe
Putting each other down
I don't know how long this love will last
If we keep kicking it around

We threaten each other with leaving
Neither one of us giving in
We're walking on thin ice baby
I don't wanna see it end

And oh, I've never let
Any woman this close to me
Don't let me down
Put in some trust, don't give up on us

Strangers again
We should talk it over
Strangers again
Let's make love and say we're sorry
Strangers again
We both need a shoulder, don't let it go

I can't stand the silence
When we don't get along
Both of us believing
That the other must surely be wrong

So strange how two people
Can be so very cruel
Both of us should know by now
Neither one's the other one's fool

And oh, I've never let
Any woman this close to me
So don't let me down

Rod Stewart,"You come to me with open arms
Tryin' to rectify my charms
You say tonight, I'm to be your lover
And by the morning light I'm to discover

Everything that you've held inside of you
What's a man like me supposed to do

Sweet, oh sweet surrender
Sweet, sweet surrender

You tell me that you're lonely and you're sad
And tonight, I'm to be your only man
You wear those things that turn my head
You ruffle my ego but not my bed

Seems like summer when you're close at hand
If I seem eager then you'll understand

Sweet, sweet surrender
Sweet, sweet surrender

Heart is tired and full of doubt
Now you've sucked me in don't spit me out
Lay your head down next to mine
And in each others arms we'll entwine

Between your heart and mind I see

Rod Stewart,"Can I tell you what you mean to mean
You're as central as the air I breathe
Almost impossible to believe
That you're mine

you're like weekends all year long
Under a hot Jamaican sun
You are a winner at a hundred to one

Something you've got
Is something I need right now
You don't have to prove it no more
I'm down on my bended knees honey

What am I gonna do, I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away

One in a million oh so rare
A nightingale in Berkeley Square
And baby I ain't goin' nowhere
Without you

You are the goal that wins the game
The very last bus home in the rain
You're like rock and roll and champagne
All in one

Something you've got
Is something I need right now
Let's not mess around any more
I'm down on my bended knees, honey

What am I gonna do, I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away
What am I gonna do, I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away

I'll be a sleek one of a kind
And so difficult to define
I could drink a case of you
Any time

The Sistine Chapel and the Eiffel Tower
A national anthem an April shower
Tomorrow's fashion and now I've found you
I'm complete

Something you've got
Is something I need right now
You don't have to prove it no more
I'm down on my bended knees, honey

What am I gonna do, I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away

I'm like a schoolboy in your hands
I wanna get up and sing and dance

Smiling from her head to her feet

Now don't you wait or hesitate
Let's move before they raise the parking rate

Watching every move on her face

Rod Stewart,"She came to the party
In a leather number wrapped in chains
Investigation found
She was very fond of dropping names
So I signed her book
And drove her to her home
And she looked so hot
Started to come on strong
Then she said so candidly
As I was gettin' down on my knees

But I'm shy, shy, shy, shy, shy""

That's nothin' but camouflage

With a winning personality
Natural born leader
With connections in society
But late at night
Alone with just his wealth

And never see himself

He had a hit with every song
Sounded like something's wrong
Why, why, why, why, why

It ain't nothin' but camouflage
Camouflage
Ain't nothing but, nothin' but
Nothin' but camouflage

They were so well suited
With an ambiance you can't ignore
But nobody realized
What went on behind closed doors
He had many affairs
But never felt fulfilled
She would hide her sadness
In alcohol and pills
She bottled everything up inside
He was too busy with his best friend's wife
They couldn't look each other in the eyes

Just camouflage
Everywhere you go it's called camouflage
Some people hide behind camouflage

But I didn't know what was goin' on

Jekyll and Hyde the way I behave
Feel like I'm running on an empty gauge

Alone in a crowd on a bus after working, I'm dreaming
The guy next to me has a girl in his arms, my arms are empty
How does it feel when the girl next to you says she loves you?
Seems so unfair when there's love everywhere but there's none for me

Trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong
I am lost in an ocean of mixed emotions now
Everything I held sacred now has gone

Here am I far from home
Learning how to be alone
Silly me I should of guessed
Never settle on second best
Time for me to reassess

Heading into trouble
I am always heading into trouble
Sideways, downways
Heading into trouble
Now I'm losing you

It's gonna be a lonely summer without you 'round
I'll even miss the way you sing off key
Down in the market the reggae bands won't sound the same
Old Joe says without you they just don't believe

Now I am no longer sure
Who's gonna open every door
The love I take and couldn't share
The warmth I had but didn't care
To give myself I never dared

Heading into trouble
I am always heading into trouble
Sideways, downways
Heading into trouble
Now I'm losing you

Heading into trouble
I am always heading into trouble

Heading into trouble
Now I'm losing you

Hope it all goes well in the future for you my dear
Hope you find where your heart truly belongs
I don't know about me and tomorrow
Cause you're gonna be a hard act to follow
I'll miss you baby every day even though you're far away
Here's to you in every way

But you never want to listen to who I am
We're divided, completely out of touch
I guess that's why we seem to fight so much

Believe me darling this ain't no game
If you think I'll be your fool
You better think again
I know you love me
It just ain't right
I'm sick and tired of fighting
with you every night

You say you don't want to hurt me
But you're doing things I can't explain
Oh baby, why don't you leave me
Because I know you'll never change

It's only another heartache
Ain't nothing to worry about
Something I'm getting used to
Dragging my heart around
But one day soon
And it won't be long
Gonna find me an angel to carry me home
It's only another heartache
Ain't nothing to worry about

I'll find a honey to take a chance
And roll that dice into my past
She'll cover me for a little while
And show me love ain't out of style

I don't care how long it takes
My heart's in the hands of fate
Oh God I ain't asking much
Just a woman that I can trust

Something I'm getting used to

In the pouring rain
Say farewell but don't say goodbye

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home

One more glass of wine
Just for auld lang syne
And the girl I left behind

How I miss her now
In my darkest hour
And the way our arms entwine

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home

And we'll drink a toast
To the blood red rose
Cheer a while the Emerald Isle

And to the northern lights
And the swirling pipes
How they make a grown man cry

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home

Rod Stewart,"On a hot summer's night 
In the year of '75
Jimmy Doyle took his child bride 
Amanda, for a drive
She was only seventeen 
He just lived to see her smile
Their commitment to each other 
Burned like a forest fire
Otis on the radio singing Stand By Me

As a trooper pulled them over
And said Jimmy where you been
Someone matching your description
Has just robbed the liquor store
Amanda said He's been with me
But they weren't listening anymore
Down at Precinct Number Five 
They questioned Jimmy through the night
The sheriff said He's gotta stand trial
Armed robbery is the charge
Amanda said This cannot be
Gonna stay right here until you set him free
And I love him

Here to eternity
Forever 
Unto eternity
Oh God gave me something 
I must hold on to
Gonna hold on him
No matter what you do
The old courthouse was crowded
As the judge reviewed the case 
In a year of re-election
He was desperate to impress 
Innocent or guilty

He saw an opportunity
To send Jimmy down for life 
To the Penitentiary
Disbelief and anger
As they dragged him away
In a cell below the courthouse
They beat him like a slave
But his use of martial arts
Struck a blow for liberty
Felled a guard with a fist of iron
And killed him instantly
All the press surrounded Amanda
Coming down the courthouse steps
Pleading for her young man's life
And in a moment seen by millions
She bowed her head and cried
Show my man some mercy
He's the father of my child
I love him

Here to eternity
Forever 
Unto eternity
Oh God gave me something 
I must hold on to
Gonna hold on him
No matter what you do 
I love him
Here to eternity
Jimmy Doyle appeared again
In a second public trail
For the murder of a prison guard
They sentenced him to die
But Amanda with her long red hair
Made one last plea
As the court fell into silence
She cried out desperately
This man of mine is innocent
As one day I shall prove
It's an open case of self defense
All this circumstantial evidence
You place before your court
Has robbed me of my husband
Forget I will not
I love him

Here to eternity
Forever 
Unto eternity
Oh goodbye my Jimmy 
'Til we meet again
In a better world than this
I swear I'll clear your name
'Cause I love you
Here to eternity",Here to Eternity
Rod Stewart,"There are places I remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some are gone and some remain

Oh these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all.

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one, compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love, as something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life,
I've loved you more",In My Life
Rod Stewart,"The mystery of you and me
Is colored blue on blue
We wanted more than we could give
We couldn't see it through

You won't believe these words from me
But still they're mine to say
I will always love you 
In my own crazy way
I tried to keep my sanity

By being someone else
Someone that you could hold on to
I only fooled myself
I knew the part, but in my heart
The role I couldn't play

But I will always love you
In my own crazy way
I know I didn't do the little things
That could make a woman's heart sing forgive me
And darling if I brought you any pain
I'm trying to explain

In my heart, I was always true
The memories of you and me
Are written on the wind
And sometimes, girl, I'd give the world
To do it all again

I won't be far away
I will always love you

Rod Stewart,"Oh, baby, I don't know why
But somehow I always seem to
Get tangled up in my pride

Don't push it all aside

'Cause I want to be good for you

To let me show you how much
I want to give you my love touch

Why can't I climb your walls
And find somewhere to hide
Can't I knock down your door
And drag myself inside
I'll light your candles baby
And maybe I'll light your life
I want to feel the breathless end
You come to every night
This ever changing love
Is pushing me too far
I feel the need to reach you
Right now wherever you are
These empty arms are getting stronger

Every day
Believe me baby
They won't let you get away
No, they won't let you get away

Rod Stewart,"Sixteen years old, looking for a hideaway
I'm a set designer, my Mum and Dad
Thinking I'm gay
I'm a lazy bugger, but I like my sport
Like girls and music, I'm happy, happy sort
(Of a guy)

But there's one thing I'm lacking
It's sexual experience
So I ask you, my sweetheart
Save me from this wilderness

I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this

Where I come from, love is
Just a hole in the wall
And the steel mills ring out and generations
Heed the call

And the rain never stops and the skies are grey
And the chance of romance
Slim as a bright sunny day

This is partly the reason
I'm so overwhelmed and shy
Because your beauty, by contrast
Is gonna make a young man cry

I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this
I've schemed, honey, of a night like this

You don't know what it means to a boy from
A suburban home
To be left with a woman like you
Completely alone

I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this
Nice place you've got here, babe
Never seen a house like this

Pool like an ocean, bed like a football pitch

All the guys at the boozer, won't believe my luck
But it couldn't have happened to a nicer bloke
(Than me)

So here we are, the record's
Gotten stuck in the groove
My knees are trembling, c'mon baby, make a move

I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this
I've schemed, honey, of a night like this
I've dreamed, I've schemed, honey
Of a night like this
I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this",A Night Like This
Rod Stewart,"I met her in a little French cafe
Legs like a young giraffe
She was sitting reading Baudelaire
Not exactly working class
She had a studio in St. Michel

Crucifix around her waist
Che Guevara all over the wall
She can't stand the sun on her face
Hey boys, what a look
Stop a train at fifty feet

Matching hair, matching clothes and eyes
Kinda like a tiger in heat
Red hot in black
Red hot in black

Revolution running through her veins
A radical from head to toe
The only record that she ever played
Was ""just like a rolling stone""
We started talking by the candlelight
Her lips get closer to mine
We started dancing all around the room
Helped by a bottle of wine
Hey boys, mystery

Didn't even know her name
One night in Paris, with a girl like that
Never going home again
Red hot in black
Red hot in black

Oh my, when I woke up
She'd already gone out to her work
My head was aching and my back was scratched
I've never, never, never known a night like that
Took a walk along the avenue
So in love and so confused
My plane was leaving in half an hour
What would you have done in my shoes?
Hey boys, so you see

Couldn't get her out a my head
My regards to the folks back home
Gonna spend some time with red

Red hot in black",Red Hot in Black
Rod Stewart,"The wind cries on the boardwalk
Oh God, it's cold tonight
Somewhere in the city
Someone's holding her tight
He's telling her she's beautiful
Touching her long blond hair
He's found out all the secrets
We swore we'd never share
Oh, it drives me crazy
To think of her with him
Come back, baby
Come back home again

Ten days of rain
Ten days of rain
My heart is filled with pain
Will she ever come back again?
Ten days of rain

She said I'm tired of talking
Trying to get it through to you
You never tell me you love me
That's all I want you to do
I thought we had a future
Something to hold on to
We even talked of children
Something I never do
She loved me like no other
She held me like a child
Come back baby, come back home again

Ten days of rain
Ten days of rain
My heart is filled with pain
Will she ever come back again?
Ten days of rain

The thought of her still haunts me
Her voice is everywhere
Ten days of rain
Ten days of rain
I can hear the freight train whistle
I can hear the church bells toll
But telephone line, when it's off the hook
That's the loneliest sound of 'em all
In the letter that she wrote me
Before she went away

She said darling, always remember
Love ain't a hard word to say
Ten days of rain
Ten days of rain, such pain
Will she ever come back again

Rod Stewart,"Well i arrived on time
My corduroy suit and me bottle of wine
There were women wall to wall
It's Saturday night and i wanted them all
Everyone

Sidled up for a dance
I tried a new step and fell in the plants
I told a joke, about the pope
It wasn't as funny as i would've hoped

Nobody told me she was the daughter
Of the mayor
I was so embarrassed, i just wished the
Ground would swallow me up
Accidentally my elbow hit the record player
The rock 'n' roll stopped
And everybody just stared
(oh no)

Who's gonna take me home
I'm tired and i want to go to bed
Who's gonna take me home
This party's gone right to my head

I didn't worry, not me
Panic ain't in my vocabulary
Smashed beyond reproach
Suddenly i wanted to take off my clothes

All hell broke loose
I started to take off my trousers and shoes
And so i tried to look cool
I stepped back and fell in the pool

The hostess helped me out
And asked for my dismissal
I said i was sorry, but i've been
Under so much pressure
Just lately, baby
I felt as popular as a russian guided missile
The last thing i remember, i left with a girl
On a motor bike
That weighed three hundred pounds and
What's wrong with that

Who's gonna take me home
I'm tired and i want to go to bed
Who's gonna take me home
This party's gone right to my head
To my head

I woke up on the floor
Still in my suit and she told me i snored
I never felt so cheap
I had a good laugh at the size of her feet

Holy Moises, i don't like this single living
I think I'll find me a nice local girl and
Settle on down, now
With a home and a garden
And a nature quite forgiving
Then again maybe I'll just hang around

Who's gonna take me home
I'm tired and i want to go to bed, right now
Who's gonna take me home

I remember the first time
That I ever seen her face
I was standing by the drug store
Tryin' to save the human race

Took a raincheck on a blind date
To get her prescription filled
We had a short talk and a long walk
Through the lazy cottonfield

It was hot
She was cool and sultry
We made love
I was broke and lonely

She's wonderful, so beautiful
So delectable, she's mine
She's desirable, so lovable
And it's criminal, almost illegal

When I heard a farmer shout
""Get away, boy, from my daughter!""
When a shotgun rang out
We took off
She was right behind me
Ran like the wind
What a crazy lady

She's fabulous, so sensuous
She's marvelous, she's mine
I'm delirious, it's serious
Kinda dangerous, almost illegal

Bring it down, now.
We had a one child by the springtime
And another on the way
I got a new life and a good wife
Ain't that amazing grace

A summer's night, a small cafe
We laughed so much, we almost cried

I think I'm falling in love with you
I said yeah, I'm the same way too
I let you in

In a motel in New Orleans
I ran away
with a hobo and his gypsy friends
We rode a freight train up to Cleveland
Across the Utah plains
Proud men, troubadours torn and frayed
Sleeping under the stars
While gently strumming guitars
Played the songs of Woddy Guthrie
And the open road
I knew right then I could never go home

So I cycled 'cross the neighborhood
Was invited by a skinny girl 
Into her high class world

Left my bicycle under the stairs
Laid my coat across the kosher chairs
Made my way across the crowded room
I had nothing to lose

My reception wasn't very keen
So turning on a friendly grin,
Stood on the table with my glass of gin
And came straight to the point

I was glad to come
I'll be sad to go
So while I'm here 
I'll have me a real good time

I was glad to come
I'll be sad to go

Singing loudly and sorta' out of tune
Was escorted by a friendly slag
'Round the ... back 

Wandered c-c-cross ...
Missed my step and I fell on the floor.
Said one word and was asked to leave
Kinda' wish I was dead.

I was glad to come
And I'll be so sad to leave,
But while I was here
I had me a real good time, oooh.

The skinny girl made it clear, 
That she only came here for the beer - that's a fact, oh yeah

Well she's really lookin' fine for eighty four
And she asked me if some time I'd fix the barn
Poor old girl, she needs a man down on the farm

Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old fashioned feeling in my bones

They have nothing that'll ever capture your heart
They're just thorns without the rose
Be careful of them in the dark
Oh if I was the one you chose to be your only one
Oh baby can't you hear me now, can't you hear me now

I know your window and I know its late
I know your stairs and your doorway
I walk down your street and past your gate
I stand by the light of the four way
And watch them as they fall, oh baby
They all having their heart attacks
They stay at the carnival
But they'll never win you back

So I cycled 'cross the neighborhood
Was invited by a skinny girl
Into her high class-world

Left my bicycle under the stairs
Laid my coat across the kosher chairs
Made my way across the crowded room
I had nothing to lose

My reception wasn't very keen
So turning on a friendly grin
Stood on the table with my glass of gin
And came straight to the point

I was glad to come
I'll be sad to go
So while I'm here I'll have me a real good time

I was glad to come
I'll be sad to go
So while I'm here I'll have me a real good time, oh no

Was escorted by a friendly slag
'Round the bedroom out back

Wandered c-c-cross the door
Missed my step and I fell on the floor
Said one word and was asked to leave
Kinda' wish I was dead

I was glad to come
And I'll be so sad to leave
But while I was here I had me a real good time, ooh

That she only came here for the beer

See it in the school yards, Passion.

Once in love you're never out of danger
One hot night spent with a stranger
All you wanted was somebody to hold on to yeah.

Once in love you're never out of danger
One hot night spent with a stranger
All you wanted was somebody to hold on to, yeah

Alone in your bed at night, passion,
It's half past midnight, passion
As you turn out your sidelight, passion,
Something ain't right, passion.

There's no passion, there's no passion
There's no passion, I need passion
You need passion, We need passion
Can't live without passion
Won't live without passion

Even the president needs passion
Everybody I know needs some passion
Some people die and kill for passion
Nobody admits they need passion
Some people are scared of passion
Yeah passion",Passion
Rod Stewart,"I am sailing
I am sailing
Home again
'Cross the sea
I am sailing,
Stormy waters
To be near you,
To be free

I am flying,
I am flying
Like a bird
'Cross the sky
I am flying,
Passing high clouds
To be with you,
To be free

Can you hear me, can you hear me
Through the dark night, far away
I am dying, forever crying
To be with you, who can say

Can you hear me, can you hear me
Through the dark night far away

Rod Stewart,"Shapes of things before my eyes
Has helped me to despise
Will time make men more wise?

Here within my lonely frame.
My eyes just hurt my brain
Will time make men more sane?

Come tomorrow will I be older?
Come tomorrow maybe a soldier (now listen)
Come tomorrow, maybe I'm older than today.

(Listen to this)
Here within my lonely frame.
My eyes just hurt my god-darn' brain
Will time make men more sane?",Shapes of Things
Rod Stewart,"So much to say and so little time to say it in
I've got so much to say, baby, ha
But so little time to say it in
But whatever I tell ya'
I hope that you will obey

Now listen
Say your prayers every night
And be so good while I'm away
Now listen here
Say your prayers every night
and be so good while I'm away
Because you know I won't be gone for long
I'll be back home with you one of these little old days, hmm-mm

I know, I know, I know

As I'd have said so many times
I got so much to say and so little time to say it in

Oh yeah hmm",So Much to Say
Rod Stewart,"Never get to bed before sunup,
Always get caught in the rain,
Sometimes I might get in trouble,
Never was one to complain.
Now gentleman, you must agree
Ain't it worth it when you're out on cloud thirty-three 
To be  stone cold sober again,
Down in the alley again,
Stone cold sober again.

Never found a dime in a gutter,
Always get my best friends drunk.
If the president tries to call me,
Say "" Rodney, come on over for lunch""
I'd say, "" Gentlemen, excuse me please
But I'm busy with my buddies up on cloud thirty-three.""
Yeah, stone cold sober again,
Down in the alley again,
Stone cold sober again.

Sunday is a drag, so forget it,
Monday you can make up for that
Tuesday, take a taste for dinner,
If you're all right spend it in bed.
But on Thursday prepare for your weekend
And let Friday disappear into Saturday morning'
When you're stone cold sober again,
Down in the alley again,
Stone cold sober again.
Stone cold sober again,
Down in the alley again,
Stone cold sober again.

I don't mind stone cold sober again,
Down in the alley again,
Stone cold sober again.",Stone Cold Sober
Rod Stewart,"Everywhere I hear the sound
Of marching, charging feet boy
'Cause the summer's here
And the time is right for
Fighting in the street boy

Hey think the time is right
For a palace revolution
Where I live the game to play
Is just to compromise my solution

What can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock 'n' roll band
'Cause you see bein' London town
There's just no other place
For a street fighting man

Hey did I tell you that my name
Was called disturbance
And I'll shout and scream
And I'll kill the king and
I'll rail at all his servants

What can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock 'n' roll band
'Cause you see bein' London town
There's just no place
For a street fighting man

Everywhere I hear the sound
Of marching, charging feet boy
'Cause the summer's here
And the time is right for
Fighting in the street boy

What can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock 'n' roll band
'Cause you see bein' London town

Rod Stewart,"Sweet Lady Mary has to rest her poor head
Wakes in the morning with her breakfast in bed
I tried to help her, but I did not know how
I tried to love her, but it's all over now
Nothing left to comfort me, except a sunny day
Steal away, steal away

Over the stones along the dusty old road
With every footstep one more tale is told
With every turning one more side to see
Sweet Lady Mary's seen the last of me
A lesson is learnt, I'll never come this way again
I'll steal away, steal away

Her Spanish habits are so hard to forget
The lady lied with every breath, I accept
Was a matter of time before my face did not fit
I knew all along I'd have to quit
Anyway now, I better not waste anymore of your time
I'll steal away, steal away

I think I'll go back home and start all again
Where the Gulf Stream waters tend to ease the pain
And on a new day when I've mended the wound
Sweet Lady Mary's gate I swear I'll be bound
But before I sit down again and waste anymore of your time
I better steal away, steal away

Ooh-hoo
I'll steal away-ay
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da",Sweet Lady Mary
