Patty Loveless,"Well it's been a long time
Since I thought about a man
I never think about maybe 
Givin' him a hand
I don't have to think twice
When it comes to you
I only have to ask
Once for me to say I do

Baby baby you're my world
Present to live here for this here girl
You hung the moon and the stars above
Baby baby
So good to be in love

Well you make it so easy
You take a second chance
Open up my heart
And gamble on romance
I want to be there
Every night and every day
When I think about you
I get carried away

Baby baby you're my world
Present to live for this here girl
You hung the moon and the stars above
Baby baby
So good to be in love

Oh baby baby you're my world
Present to live for this here girl 
You hung the moon and the stars above
Baby baby
So good to be in love
So good to be in love",So Good to Be in Love
Patty Loveless,"I love the hands of the working man
Working all day in the sun
Every morning there's a mountain to be moved
By the end of the day it's done

I love the hands of my working man
Touching me tenderly
I can feel the heart of my working man
When his hands are holding me

Working man's hands, gentle as moonlight
Working man's hands, strong as steel
He must of been thinking 'bout me
When the Lord made my working man's hands

Daddy always wanted the best for me
Wanted me to have more than he had
He dreamed of riches and finer things
But I'd rather have a working man like my dad

Working man's hands, gentle as moonlight
Working man's hands, strong as steel
He must of been thinking 'bout me
When the Lord made my working man's hands

Life can be hard in this world of ours
But it's easier when someone cares
So I'll take the hand of my working man
He's the answer to this working girls prayers

Working man's hands, gentle as moonlight
Working man's hands, strong as steel
He must of been thinking 'bout me
When the Lord made my working man's hands

",Working Man's Hands
Patty Loveless,"When I close my eyes
I almost see
The way you look
When you were standing next to me
And I still feel you holdin' me tight
Oh I can hear the laughter
And all the words you whispered in the night

Picture this and paint it blue
A photograph of me and you
Smile has faded with the years
Washed away by all the tears
And when I look
All I see are blue memories

Oh how I remember the time
There was love in your heart
And that love was mine
If I could turn it all 'round again
We'd be lying side by side
And things would be the way
They were back then

Picture this and paint it blue
A photograph of me and you
Smile has faded with the years
Washed away by all the tears
And when I look
All I see are blue memories

Picture this and paint it blue
A photograph of me and you
Smile has faded with the years
Washed away by all the tears
And when I look
All I see are blue memories
Blue memories
Blue memories",Blue Memories
Patty Loveless,"I leave you with something
You can't understand
You can't buy or sell it
Or hold it in your hands
It's greater than this world of ours
Or the heavens above
I leave you with feelings of love

It's as free as the wild wind
As gentle as a lamb
It fills the angels with envy
It's givin' free to man
Gives courage to the lion
Peace to the dove
I leave you with feelings of love

Feelings of love
Are what make my love real
Feelings of love
Are the best things to feel
You gave it to me freely
Now I leave it with you
I leave you my feelings of love

It gives man to a woman
Gives a woman to her man
It makes friends out of enemy's
It makes our hearts join hands
You gave it to me freely
Now I leave it with you
I leave you my feelings of love",Feelings of Love
Patty Loveless,"There's a man in a Stetson hat, howlin' like an alley cat
Outside my window tonight
Sayin', ""Baby, put on something hot, meet me in the parking lot
About a quarter to nine""

I get the feelin' that he's never read Romeo and Juliet
I'm gettin' tired of these one night stands
But if you want to make a real romance

I'm that kind of girl, I'm that kind of girl
I ain't the woman in red, I ain't the girl next door
But if somewhere in the middle's what you're lookin' for
I'm that kind of girl, yes I'm that kind of girl

Let me tell you that I like my lovin' just as much as any woman
But I'm drawin' the line
A little sensitivity always seems to get to me every time
I'm a sucker for a love-sick fool
The kind that carries all your books in school
I'm getting tired of these one night stands
But if you're lookin' for a real romance

I'm that kind of girl, I'm that kind of girl
I ain't the woman in red, I ain't the girl next door
But if somewhere in the middle's what you're lookin' for
I'm that kind of girl, yes I'm that kind of girl

I'm that kind of girl, I'm that kind of girl
I ain't the woman in red, I ain't the girl next door

I'm that kind of girl, oh whoa
I'm that kind of girl, oh whoa",I'm That Kind of Girl
Patty Loveless,"The bright lights don't thrill me
 Like they used to do
 They only remind me
 Of times spent with you
 And every old memory
 Rekindles the flame
 I've got to stop loving you
 And start living again

 The people all tell me
 With time I'll forget
 The sweet love you gave me
 And they'll be no regrets
 But each time I see you
 It's always the same
 Oh I've got to stop loving you
 And start living again

 I've got stop dreaming
 About all the times
 When you told me
 You loved me
 And would always be mine
 And maybe one day
 Find somebody new
 And start living over
 And stop loving you

 The rain on my window
 Flows down like tears
 It seems to know that
 I'm lonesome in here
 Oh I guess I
 Should step out
 And see some old friends
 I've got to stop loving you
 And start living again
 Oh I've got to stop loving you
 And start living again",I've Got to Stop Loving You (And Start Living Again)
Patty Loveless,"I wonder should I tell you
About all the crazy things
I've ever done
I've been a rebel all my life
And when I should have stayed
I tried to run
I was searching for an answer
In this world full of strangers
But what I found was never enough
Now that I found you
Looking in the eyes of love

Darlin' you've been good to me
You are so much more than I deserve
I never thought that I would find
Someone who's so sweet and kind
Like you
Please believe me
When I say
This time I won't run away
I swear by all of heavens stars above
Now that I found you
I'm looking in the eyes of love

Looking in the eyes of love
I can see forever
I can see you and me
Walking through this old world together
Oh my hearts found a home
I've been dreaming of
Now that I found you
I'm looking in the eyes of love

Oh my hearts found a home

Now that I found you

Patty Loveless,"Sylvia was workin' as a waitress in Beaumont
She said I'm movin' away, I'm gonna get what I want
I'm tired of these small-town boys that don't move fast enough
I'm gonna find me one who wears a leather jacket and likes his livin' rough

So she saved her tips and overtime and bought an old rusty car
She sold most everything she had to make a brand new start
She said I won't be needing these silly dresses and nylon hose
'Cause when I get to where I'm goin' I'm gonna buy me all new clothes

The night's too long, 
It just drags on and on
And then there's never enough,
That's when the sun starts comin' up
Don't let go of her hand,
You just might be the right man
She loves the night, She loves the night
She doesn't want the night, don't want it to end
Don't want it to end.

She works in an office now and she guesses the pays all right
She can buy a few new things to wear and still go out at night
And as soon as she gets home from work she wants to be out with the crowd
Where she can dance and toss her hair back and laugh out loud

Well the music's playin' fast and they just met
He presses up against her and his shirt's all soaked with sweat
And with her back against the bar she can listen to the band
And she's holdin' a Corona and it's cold against her hand

The night's too long, It just drags on and on
And then there's never enough,
That's when the sun starts comin' up
Don't let go of her hand,
You just might be the right man
She loves the night, She loves the night
She doesn't want the night, don't want it to end
Don't want it to end.",The Night's Too Long
Patty Loveless,"Tryin' to make a livin
That's the bottom line
It ain't easy tryin' to stretch
A nickle into a dime

Half goes to the
Landlord, Lord
And half to Uncle Sam

I can't get no satisfaction
And my tractor don't get no traction

Tryin' to make a stand
Laughin' and cryin'
Livin' and dyin' on down the line

I'll leave my soul to Jesus
I'll give my heart to you
And if you want the rest of me
Well, darlin you can have that too
Only love can save me
So darlin don't be late

In this lovin' game

Patty Loveless,"The wind is cold, I walk alone
My head is hanging low
The friend I found within myself
Is the only one I know

The blossoms of the dogwood tree
Have fallen all away
And like our love they lay to rest
Beneath the red, red clay

Some morning soon before the dawn
I'll wake to find you gone
I'm learning how to lose you now
And how to carry on

Your love, your love has known no fears
Your heart can feel no pain
I know, I know you'll soon be gone
To ride that midnight train

Some morning soon before the dawn
I'll wake to fine you gone
I'm learning how to lose you now
And how to carry on
I'm learning how to lose you now
And how to carry on

Patty Loveless,"When you said you love me
I believed it was true
It was true
And now you say you're leaving
Now you got me needing you
You go and say we're through
You say nothing last forever
That's so easy
You can walk away
But you won't be free

You can run everytime we touch
You can run when you feel to much
You can lie all alone in the dark
You can run from the one you need
You can run from the memories
But you can't run away from your heart

Said our love was real
More than any love you knew
It was good to you
But when I held you near me
I could feel all the fear in you
Runnin' through and through
You think tears are all that lie in true loves shadow
There's no place that you can run
Our love won't follow

You can run everytime we touch
You can run when you feel to much
You can lie all alone in the dark
You can run from the one you need
You can run from the memories
But you can't run away from your heart

You can run everytime we touch
You can run when you feel to much
You can lie all alone in the dark

Patty Loveless,"Raindrops fall from the sky
Teardrops fall from my eyes
Can't stop myself from loving you
Your heartaches found a home
I walk these streets alone
Can't stop myself from loving you

I know I shouldn't waste my time
In dreams of yesterday
But your memory's all that
I have left
Since you've gone away
No matter what I do
My heart stays cold and blue
Can't stop myself from loving you

They say that time
Can heal a lonely heart
That's broke in two
But time ran out on me the day

Like you're already gone

If you could rock my heart to sleep
With your breath upon my cheek
I could dream you'd be returning

But when I face reality
Hands of time, hands of time
Don't turn for me
I already miss you

All I've got is what I've got
I can't act like what I'm now
Got an old soul
A tender heart
And I came straight to you

Well I do my best to tell the truth
Ask my friends if you need proof
If you don't count my wreck-less youth
I came straight to you

Thought I walked a twisted trail
'Til I saw where it led me to
Yeah, one foot in front of the other baby
And I came straight to you 

Had this picture in my mind
Of someone that I hoped
I'd find
Honey I've known you a long long time

Well it seemed such a long shot
But somehow my aim was true
Like a moonbeam across the water baby

Like a shadow in the night
And it hangs like a curtain

It's a matter of time

If it's the last thing I do
I'll sleep without dreaming
Your memory won't wake me
To cry in the dark
When my heart isn't beating
It might finally quit aching
I'll get over you
If it's the last thing I do

You're my love of a lifetime
The one I knew would last
And I know I'll spend my future
Livin' in my past
But there will come a time
When my tears have all fallen'

And we were wrong

I watched my best friend Jamie slipping further away
I kept on waving till I couldn't see her
And through my tears I asked again why we couldn't stay
Mama whispered softly time will ease your pain
Life's about changing nothing ever stays the same
And she said how can I help you to say goodbye it's okay to hurt and it's okay to cry
Come let me hold you and I will try how can I help you to say goodbye

I sat on our bed he packed his suitcase I held a picture of our wedding day
His hands were trembling we both were crying
He kissed me gently and then he quickly walked away
I called up mama and she said time will ease your pain

She said how can I help you...

Can you hear that mournful sound
I'm riding rails of silver
Going to where I'm bound

High above the fields of clover
On a lazy, hot July
When I get to where I'm going
I'll hold my head up high
I will roll across these mountains
I will take the last train out
Riding rails of silver
Going to where I'm bound

Roses, dust and ashes
Throw them where I lay
And if by chance you see me
There'll be no sorrow on my face

For I will see the beauty
I only wish that you could see
I'll leave my body weakened
I'll leave my soul to wander free, so free

He wasted not his time away
He prayed to God
Every morning, noon, and night
He cared not for the things avail
But trusted one who never fails
Oh, Daniel prayed
Each morning, noon, and night

Oh, Daniel served his living God
While upon the earth he trod
He prayed to God each morning, noon, and night
He cared not for the king's decrees
But trusted God to set him free
Oh, Daniel prayed every morning, noon, and night

They locked him in the lions' den
Because he could not honor men
But he prayed to God
Every morning, noon, and night
The jaws were locked; it made him shout
And God soon brought him safely out
Oh, Daniel prayed
Every morning, noon, and night

Oh, Daniel served his living God
While upon the earth he trod
He prayed to God each morning, noon, and night
He cared not for the king's decrees
But trusted God to set him free
Oh, Daniel prayed every morning, noon, and night

Like Daniel did from day to day
He prayed to God
Every morning, noon, and night
We, too, can gladly dare and do
And pray to God he'll see us through
Oh, Daniel prayed
Every morning, noon, and night

Oh, Daniel served his living God
While upon the earth he trod
He prayed to God each morning, noon, and night
He cared not for the king's decrees
But trusted God to set him free
Oh, Daniel prayed every morning, noon, and night",Daniel Prayed

Take their advice to heart

Rise up Lazarus
Rise up from the dust
If in Jesus you believe
Then you shall be released

Go forth John and Paul
Spread the Gospel to them all
Give them courage to believe
And they shall be released

Now Jesus went to Bethany
In answer to an urgent plea
Two sisters fell down at his feet
They began to cry and weep
They lead him to their brother's grave
Jesus knelt to God and prayed

(Chorus)
Rise up Lazarus
Rise up from the dust
If in Jesus you believe
Then you shall be released

Go forth John and Paul
Spread the Gospel to them all
Give them courage to believe
And they shall be released

Now doubters who would not believe
Spread the word of what they'd seen
Then they began to congregate
First two to four then four to eight
God watched faithful multiply
As they echoed Jesus Cried

(Chours)
Rise up Lazarus
Rise up from the dust
If in Jesus you believe
Then you shall be released

Go forth John and Paul
Spread the Gospel to them all
Give them courage to believe
And they shall be released

Now all us children here on Earth
Sometimes doubt worldly worth
But if in Jesus you do trust
You will rise like Lazarus
So if your feelin' down and out
Open up your heart and shout

Rise up Lazarus
Rise up from the dust
If in Jesus you believe
Then you shall be released

Go forth John and Paul
Spread the Gospel to them all
Give them courage to believe
And they shall be released

Give them courage to believe

The palest shade of a winter day
They filled her with a raging fire

She shined for him like candlelight
That softly beckons in the night
But he said no right to her face
Then simply turned and walked away

All Heaven watched from way on high
True love given and denied
And while her heart was broke and bleeding
Sorrowful angels wept into their wings

She wore him like a lock and chain
Only in dreams she spoke his name
By day it slipped upon her tongue
The taste of unrequited love 
Now her hair is long and gray
The palest shade of a winter day
She never took a ring of gold
She swears she never loved a soul

I am a soul of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my days
I bid farewell to east Kentucky
The place where I was born and raised
For many a year I have struggled
No pleasure here on Earth I've found
All through this world I'm bound to wander
There is no one to help me now
You can bury me in some deep valley
For many a year in peace I'll lay
Then you may learn to love another
While I am sleeping in my grave
It's fare-you-well my one true lover
I never 'spect to see you again
But there's one promise that is given
I'll meet you in God's golden land

That's the place where I trace my bloodline
And it's there I read on a hillside gravestone

""You'll never leave Harlan alive""

Oh, my grandfather's dad crossed the Cumberland Mountains
Where he took a pretty girl to be his bride
Said, ""Won't you walk with me, out of the mouth of this holler
or we'll never leave Harlan alive""

Where the sun comes up about ten in the mornin'
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinkin'
And you spend your life just thinkin' of how to get away

No one ever knew there was coal in them mountains
Till a man from the northeast arrived
Wavin' hundred dollar bills, said, ""I'll pay you for your minerals""
But he never left Harlan alive

Grandma sold out cheap and they moved out west of Pineville
To a farm where Big Richland River winds
And I bet they danced them a jig
And they laughed and sang a new song
""Who said we'd never leave Harlan alive""

But the times they got hard and tobacco wasn't sellin'
And old granddad knew what he'd do to survive
He went and dug for Harlan coal
And sent the money back to grandma
But he never left Harlan alive

Where the sun comes up about ten in the mornin'
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinkin'
And you spend your life diggin' coal from the bottom of your grave

Patty Loveless,"As each long day rolls by and falls behind me
In the lonely night there's a peacefulness I've found
Though I'm weary even then when I rise to start again
There'll be a diamond, a diamond in my crown

I have wasted all that life has laid before me
I have watched as all the green fields turn to brown
But I shall not disavow all these ties that bind me now
There'll be a diamond, a diamond in my crown

Shining down some day I know
Brighter than all their streets of gold
When the burdens that I carry I will lay down
And the sorrows I have known
I'll see them all overthrown
There'll be a diamond, a diamond in my crown
Then the closer I will be to my sweetest victory
There'll be a diamond a diamond in my crown",Diamond in My Crown

There's no sweet revenge
At love's angry end
And we all need to know

And the bitter cold darkness of night
Floods the days of our lives
With a silence so loud we can't feel at all

To cheer or applaud
When the last curtain falls

Well, the irony is that you're wearing the look I once wore
And in truth I've longed for this moment to settle the score
But it's not all that clear, now hearing
You echo the thoughts of my soul
The justice of time Is really not mine

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Of poetry philosophy and all the things that make you wonder how this world goes round

So for today I'll be still life with window view

Evitando le mani e gli sputi di chi non ha cura di noi

Un re e una regina tra gli dei

Emulando chi sembrava meglio di quanto è davvero
Evitando gli insulti e il veleno di chi non ha cura di noi

Finché tornerà sereno

E sereno verrà così velocemente che non ce ne accorgeremo

Qualche cosa di diverso

Forse la vita sì è quache cosa di diverso

Non trovi che spogliarsi sia la cosa più geniale

E dentro a piccoli discorsi farci entrare

Tutte quante le canzoni

È solo un modo di guardare

You leave me lonely, now

I know your window; I know it's late
I know your stairs and your doorway
I walk down your street and past your gate
I stand by the light at the four way
You watch them as they fall
And they all catch heart attacks
They stay at the carnival, Baby
But they'll never win you back

Will I see you tonight

Patty Smyth,"I'm no angel, it's hard to hide,
Got a rebel mouth and a ticket to ride
I'm no angel, but I'm not so tough
The boys in the town are gonna treat you rough
They're all heroes in the darkness
When they talk in the street
They can make anything dirty
That's supposed to be sweet
I'm no angel, not a slave to love
But this pain in my heart, it fits me like a glove

Something gonna save me, I know it will

I can hear it in my heart

I want to be a rock 'n' roll girl

It's a heartache heard round the world
What's that sound

Who don't know me quite as well
Yeah, like a gypsy she would be my jewel
Spend my days in her lovin' spell

But baby, I fit you like a worn out glove
You know, I ain't going nowhere
There ain't nothing we can't rise above
We've still got a lifetime to share

Isn't it enough that I still love you
Isn't it enough to make you stay
Don't make me suffer, baby
Don't throw it all away

Now I know, you're tired and feelin' all alone
I know what you're going through
I'll satisfy your fire but I'm not made of stone
Tell me what more can I do?

Isn't it enough that I still love you
Isn't it enough to make you stay
Don't make me suffer, baby
Don't throw it all away

Now can you look in my eyes and tell me
There's nothing there, you know
I've compromised enough to show I care
So isn't it enough

Sometimes I'd like to quit you and find somebody
Who don't know me quite the same
But it took so long just to get this far
I'll be damned if I'll do it again

Isn't it enough to make you stay

Don't throw it all away

Patty Smyth,"I met a man who would be king
He had a dream to see forever
It was a promise in the dark
It was a promise we made together
I was a girl who would be queen
I didn't know the cost of freedom
It was a secret he would share
It was a word we both could believe in
Some kind of hero
Catch me again I'm falling
'Cause I can hear you calling

It's never enough, it's never enough,
 it's never enough
It's never enough, it's never enough,

I met a man who had no name
He spoke the language of the spirit
He took a chance for heart & soul
And with a laugh, he dared me to hear it
I met a man who watched the stars
He had the faith behind the reasons
It was a secret he would share
It was a world we all could believe in
Some kind of hero
Catch me again I'm falling
'Cause I can hear you calling

Patty Smyth,"I took a walk today through these grey
 and dirty streets
Thinking of you, missing you,
 and hoping that we'd meet
I didn't tell my legs where to go
They just walked down to the dock
I sat on the edge fighting a shiver
Telling everything I hurt inside

[CHORUS:]
And the river cried 'cause I lost your love
The river cried, oh
The river cried for my lonely soul
The river cried
You were the only one who really knew me
You were the only one in whom I'd confide

And hearing this
The river cried
I saw myself today through these grey
 and dirty streets
Did you have to leave this town
 or did you just have to leave me?
All these questions echo in my mind
Why didn't I see the signs?
The river keeps flowing, I can't keep going
Waiting for you to return my sigh.

And the years went too

'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".",Mood Indigo
Patty Waters,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Patty Waters,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me
Patty Waters,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear

Patty Waters,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",He's Funny That Way
Patty Waters,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove

Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon

I hate to see that evening sun go down

If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues

Since I wondered from my home
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born
Many page in life has turned
Many lessons I have learned
Yet I feel that in those hills I still belong

Way down yonder in the Indian nation
I'd ride my pony on the reservation
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born
Way down yonder in the Indian nation
A cowboys life was my occupation
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born

As I'm standing here today 
I am many miles away
From the place I rode my pony through the draw
Where the oak and blackjack trees 
Kiss the playful prairie breeze
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born

From dirty words and muddy cells your clothes are soiled and stained
But the dirty words and the mud of cells will soon be judged insane

Oh take off your thirsty boots
And stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evenin'
And the mornin' in your eyes

Then tell me of the ones you saw
As far as you could see
Across the plains from field to town
Marchin' to be free
And of the rusted prison gates that tumble by degree
Like laughing children one by one
They look like you and me

So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try
Just lookin' for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes

I know you are no stranger down the crooked rainbow trial
From dancing cliff edge shattered sills to slander shackled jails
Where the voices drift up from below as walls are bein' scaled
Yes all of this and more my friend your song shall not be failed

Oh take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary, from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh, and maybe I can try
Just lookin for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes

Paul & Sheila Smith,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song

Just talking to the rain
You said I've been driving you crazy
And it's keeping you away

So just give me one good reason
Tell me, why I should stay?
'Cause I don't wanna waste another moment
Saying things we were never meant to say

And I, take it just a little bit
I, hold my breath and count to ten
I've been waiting for a chance to let you in

If I just breathe, how do you fill the space in between?
Oh, no, everything is alright
Breathe, everything little piece of me
You'll see everything is alright
If I just breathe

Well, it's ours, so overrated
Not saying how you feel
So you end up watching chances fade
And wonder in which way?

And I, give you just a little time
I, wonder if you realize?
I've been waiting till I see it in your eyes

If I just breathe, how do you fill the space in between?
Oh, no, everything is alright
Breathe, everything little piece of me
You'll see everything is alright
If I just breathe, breathe

So I whisper and I'm
Hoping you hear me

Aren't you glad you've got two ears?
And if your heart is singing, too,
Aren't you glad you're you?

You can see a summer sky,
Or touch a friendly hand,
Or taste an apple pie.

Aren't you glad that you were born?

Keep your fingers under control.

The whole heart whole.
Marry maids can sew and sleep;
Wives can only sew and weep!

Falling in love with love is playing the fool;
Caring too much in such a juvenile fancy.

I gave now from wanting 
Something in return 
So cry just a little for me 

Give it up baby 
A whimper would be fine 
Some kind of clue that 
You're doing time 
Some kind of heartache 
Honey give it a try 
I don't want pity 
I just want what is mine",Cry

Let's pretend that we're together, all alone.
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low,
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go.

Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true,
Or is he holding you the way I do?
Tho' love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know,
Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go?

You can't say the words I want to hear
While you're with another man,
If you want me, answer ""yes"" or ""no,""

Paul Anka,"Everyday my papa would work
To try to make ends meet
To see that we would eat
Keep those shoes upon my feet

Every night my papa would take me
And tuck me in my bed
Kiss me on my head
After all my prayers were said

And there were years
Of sadness and of tears
Through it all
Together we were strong

We were strong
Times were rough
But Papa he was tough
Mama stood beside him all along

Growing up with them was easy
The time had flew on by
The years began to fly
They aged and so did I

And I could tell
That mama she wasn't well
Papa knew and deep down so did she
So did she

When she died
Papa broke down and he cried
And all he could say was, ""God, why her? Take me!""
Everyday he sat there sleeping in a rocking chair

He never went upstais
Because she wasn't there
Then one day my Papa said,
""Son, I'm proud of how you've grown""

He said, ""Go out and make it on your own.
Don't worry. I'm O.K. alone.""
He said, ""There are things that you must do""
He said, ""There's places you must see""

And his eyes were sad as he
As he said goodbye to me
Every time I kess my children
Papa's words ring true

He said, ""Children live through you.
Let them grow! They'll leave you, too""
I remember every word Papa used to say
I kiss my kids and pray

That they'll think of me
Oh how I pray
They will think of me
That way

I think about a night
When the earth smelled of summer
And the sky was streaked with white
And the soft mist of England
was sleeping on a hill

There are new lovers now
on the same silent hill
Looking on the same blue sea
And I know Tom and I
are a  part of them all
And they're all a part of Tom and me

I hope your troubles are few
All my good wishes go with you tonight
I've been in love like you

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star
Be brave and faithful and true
Cling very close to each other tonight
I've been in love like you

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels
And to fly down a street in a trance
You fly down a street on a chance  that you'll meet
And you meet not really by chance

Don't cry young lovers whatever you do
Don't cry because I'm alone

Paul Anka,"Some sleepless night, 
If you should find yourself alone,
Let me be the one you run to,
Let me be the one you come to 
When you need someone to turn to, 
Let me be the one.

To set things right 
When this old world's turned upside down,
Let me be the one you run to,
Let me be the one you come to 
When you need someone to turn to, 
Let me be the one.

For love and understanding, 
To find a quiet place;
For silent understanding, 
A loving touch.
Come to me when things go wrong 
And there's no love to light the way.

Paul Anka,"Anytime you need me babe
Just call I'll be there
Call and see what a good friend can be
When you need someone to care
Nothing more than understanding
Just a man who's undemanding 
Like a leaf that's only landing suddenly
Goes when the wind gently blows

And I'm asking nothing of you love
Only what you want to give
And I wish you what I wish myself 
As long as I may live
Other arms will surely hold you
Just remember the things that I told you
When these arms of mine enfold you
It's not out of greed but for love 
And for need

I love you so, I still do
I'm sure you know when I'm holding you
The sad part of seeing you is goodbye
Call and I'll come when your world's  come undone
I'm like you, I get lonely too 
And I need someone to hold
Knowing well this world can be hell
And sometimes very cold

Nothing firm and nothing binding
Now and then a slight reminding
Waking up one day and finding
Somewhere to run, somewhere to run
Somewhere to run when your world's come undone
Oh babe, I'll be there, I'll be there anytime

There's a certain thing about you
Summer, fall and spring about you
I could write and sing about you 
And never run out, never run out (no)
Never run out of what you're all about 
Oh babe, I'll be there , I'll be there anytime",Anytime (I'll Be There)

Help me make it through the night

When you get to thinking no one cares

Lean on me

You wake up and time has slipped away
And suddenly it's hard to find
The memories you left behind
Remember, do you remember?

The laughter and the tears
The shadows of misty yesteryears
The good times and the bad you've seen
And all the others in between
Remember, do you remember 
The times of your life? (do you remember?)

Reach out for the joy and the sorrow
Put them away in your mind
The memories are time that you borrow
To spend when you get to tomorrow

Here comes the saddest part (comes the saddest part)

So gather moments while you may
Collect the dreams you dream today
Remember, will you remember

Faces of the sadness,
People are trying to survive,
And when it isn't so,
The children are wondering why.

We must keep our promise,
The truth is a parting us,
Peace is the word of the day,
And when you start,
That your heart'll lead the way.

Look around, and what do you see,
All the misery, the pain you see,
Can't believe, some of the things I see
that's going on is wrong.

We've to get along,
If we don't get together,
We will be gone

And what a world will be, 
And what do you start, within your heart,

How long can this go on, 
It isn't right to fight for the right,
That we're belong.

Neither one knows what to say
Both falling for love

Reaching back to yesterday
Longing to know 
If they are the ones to stay
 
After all I'm the one who said we're through
Now I can't live without anymore
Out there lost is the dream that can't come true
Is it worth the reaching for
Don't you want me anymore, darling
 
Hold me till the morning comes
Until I see your smile
Take all the sadness from your eyes
Hold me till the morning sun
Let me stay we've just begun

Where shall we start
Tender words that we can share
Different believes
In time we will get there
 
Look at us now
Wanting more than words can say

But distant all the way
 
Out there lost are the words I still love you
But they worth the reaching for
Do you love me anymore, darling

We're happy tonight
Walking
In a winter wonderland

Gone away
Is the bluebird
Here to stay
Is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking
In a winter wonderland

In the meadow
We can build a snowman
And pretend
That he is parson brown
He'll say are you married?
We'll say no man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking
In a winter wonderland

In the meadow
We can build a snowman
And pretend
That he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun
With Mr. Snowman
Until the other kids
Come knock him down

When it's cold
Ain't it thrilling
When your nose
Gets to chilling
We'll frolic and play
The Eskimo way
Walking
In a winter wonderland

Home safely to me.

You got it tough, I've seen the toughest around

You got to roll with the punches and get what's real

Can't you see me standin' here
I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Can't you see what I mean?

Go ahead an' jump, jump
Go ahead and jump, jump

You say you don't know, you won't know until you begin

I ain't the worst that you've seen
Can't you see what I mean?

Go ahead jump, jump
Go ahead and just jump, jump

Paul Anka,"We move like cagey tigers
We couldn't get closer than this
The way we lovecats
The way we talk
The way we stalk
The way we kiss
We slip through the streets
While everyone sleeps
Getting bigger and sleeker
And wider and brighter
We bite and scratch and scream all night
Let's go and
Throw all the songs we know
Into the sea
You and me
All these years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring
It's a treacherous thing
We missed you hissed the lovecats

We're so wonderfully wonderfully wonderfully
Wonderfully pretty
Oh you know that I'd do anything for you
We should have each other to tea huh? 
We should have each other with cream
Then curl up by the fire
And sleep for awhile
It's the grooviest thing
It's the perfect dream

Hand in hand
Is the only way to land
And always the right way round
Not broken in pieces
Like hated little meeces
How could we miss
Someone as dumb as this

I love you ... let's go
Oh ... solid gone ...
How could we miss someone as dumb
As this?

Always in time, but never in line for dreams

Why do I find it hard to write the next line

You give me fever like I've never known, yes
You're just a product of loneliness

I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up and we'll paint the town
Because you kiss me baby and tell me twice
That you're the one for me

The way you make me feel
You're really turning me on
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone

I like the feelin' you're givin' me
Hold me baby, I'm in ecstasy
And I'll be workin' from nine to five
To buy you things to keep you by my side

And I've never felt so in love before
Promise me baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me

Janey was lovely, she was the queen of my nights
There in the darkness with the radio playing low

And the secrets that we shared
The mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
Till there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove

How she swore that it never would end
I remember how she held me oh so tight

I found myself further and further from my home

And I guess I lost my way
There were oh so many roads
I was living to run and running to live
Never worried about paying or even how much I owed

Moving eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breaking all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searchin'
Searching for shelter again and again

Against the wind
A little something against the wind
I found myself seeking shelter against the wind

Sometimes I lie awake, night after night
Coming apart at the seams
Eager to please, ready to fight
Why do I go to extremes?

[Chorus]

No I don't know why I go to extremes
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
You can be sure when I'm gone
I won't be out there too long
Darling I don't know why I go to extremes",I Go to Extremes
Paul Anka,"Coming out of my cage, I'm doing just fine
And I gotta, gotta be down, I'm wanting it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
Only a kiss, it was only a kiss

Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
He's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
They're going to bed and my stomach is sick
It's all in my head

She's touching his chest
Now, he takes off her dress, now, let me, let me go
I just can't look because it's killing me
And it's taking control

[Chorus]
Jealousy turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes

I'm Mr. Brightside
I'm Mr. Brightside
Mr Brightside

Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
He's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
They're going to bed and my stomach is sick
It's all in my head

Paul Anka,"Came in from a rainy Thursday
On the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights, the TV
And the radio
Still I can't escape the ghost of you

What has happened to it all?
Crazy some say
Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Passion or coincidence
Once prompted you to say
Pride will tear us both apart
Well now pride's gone out the window
Cross the rooftops, runaway
Left me in the vacuum of my heart

What is happening to me?
Crazy some say
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Papers in the roadside
Tell of suffering and greed
Feared today forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here beside the news
Of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk

(Blown away)
(Just blowing away)

And I don't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Any world is my world
(I will learn to survive)

Every world is my world
(I will learn to survive)",Ordinary World
Paul Anka,"Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,
And think of you
Caught up in circles confusion -
Is nothing new
Flashback - warm nights -
Almost left behind
Suitcases of memories,
Time after -

Sometimes you picture me -
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear
What you've said -
Then you say - go slow -
I fall behind -
The second hand unwinds

[Chorus]
If you're lost you can look 
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you 
I'll be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has
Turned to gray
Watching through windows - you're wondering
If I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time -

You said go slow 
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

When you love someone

It feels so right, so warm and true
I need to know if you feel it too

Maybe I'm wrong
Won't you tell me if I'm coming on too strong?
This heart of mine has been hurt before
This time I wanna be sure

I've been waiting for a girl like you
To come into my life
I've been waiting for a girl like you

I've been waiting for someone new
To make me feel alive
Yeah, waiting for a girl like you
To come into my life

When we make love it's understood
It's more than a touch or a word we say
Only in dreams could it be this way
When you love someone
Yeah, really love someone

Now, I know it's right
From the moment I wake up till deep in the night
There's no where on earth that I'd rather be
Than holding you, tenderly

And I boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain

But I'm as blue as a boy can be

[Chorus]
Then I'm walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel

Saw the ghost of Elvis
On Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
Then I watched him walk right through

Now security they did not see him
They just hovered 'round his tomb
But there's a pretty little thing
Waiting for the King
Down in the Jungle Room

They've got catfish on the table
They've got gospel in the air
And Reverend Green be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
But boy you've got a prayer in Memphis

Now Muriel plays piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would

Do a little number
And I sang with all my might
And she said
'Tell me are you a Christian child''
And I said 'Ma'am I am tonight'

Everything that we touched...turned to love.

The old moon laughed and sang a song
As they rocked in the wooden shoe
And the wind that sped them all night long
Ruffled the waves of dew

Well the little stars where the herring fish
That lived in the beautiful sea
""Now cast your nets where ever you wish
Never afraid are we,""
So sang the stars to the fishermen three
Wynken and Blynken and Nod

All night long their nets they threw
To the stars in the twinkling foam
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe
Bringing the fishermen home

'Twas all so pretty a sight it seemed
As if it could not be
But some folks thought 'twas a dream they'd dreamed
Of sailing the beautiful sea
But I shall name you the fishermen three
Wynken and Blynken and Nod

Now Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes
And a Nod is a little head
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
Is a wee-one's trundle bed

So close your eyes while daddy sings
Of the beautiful sights that be
You will see the wonderful things
As you rock in the misty sea
Where the old moon rocked the fishermen three

Paul Austin Kelly,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You
Paul Austin Kelly,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You
Paul Bacon,"The weather is frightening.
The thunder and lightning
Seem to be having their way.
But as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day. 
The turn in the weather
Will keep us together
So I can honestly say,
That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day
And everything's okay.

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain.
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain.

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea,
The clouds broke, they broke and oh what a break for me.

I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in a storm.
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm.

Let the rain pitter patter
But it really doesn't matter 
If the skies are gray.
Long as I can be with you, it's a lovely day.",Isn't This a Lovely Day?

Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout the universe displayed

Then sings my soul my Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
Then sings my soul my Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art

When through the woods, and forest glades I wander
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze

And when I think that God, His Son not sparing
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in
That on the cross my burden gladly bearing
He bled and died to take away my sin

When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow in humble adoration
And there proclaim my God how great Thou art",How Great Thou Art

I don’t need this, anyway.

Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still",My Heart Stood Still
Paul Bley,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love
Paul Bley,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you.",Time on My Hands
Paul Bley,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me
Paul Bley,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head
Paul Bley,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams
Paul Bley,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Paul Bley,"Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed

Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you

Tell me to save my tears
Well I'm so mad about him
I can't live without him

Never treats me sweet and gentle

I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light

I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light",I'm Beginning to See the Light

With dreadful ease

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is

We were young and we knew, and our eyes were alive
Deep inside we knew our love was true
For a while we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last
Every night somethin' right 
Would invite us to begin the dance
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be happy was sad

Oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me one
And not let me stay around?
Oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

With all we would ever need
Love was strong for so long
Never knew that what was wrong
Baby, wasn't right

Til sadness was all we shared
We were scared this affair

Paul Bollenback,"She sits alone by a lamp post 
Tryin' to find the thought that's escaped her mind.
She says, ""Dad's the one I love the most.
But Stipe's not far behind.""
 
She never lets me in, only tells me where she's been
When she's had too much to drink.
I say that I don't care, I just run my hands through her dark hair,
Then I pray to God you gotta help me fly away.
 
And just let her cry if the tears fall down like rain.
Let her sing if it eases all her pain.
Let her go, let her walk right out on me.
And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be, let her be.
 
This morning I woke up alone, found a note standing by the phone
Sayin', ""Maybe, maybe I'll be back someday.""
I wanted to look for you.
You walked in, I didn't know just what I should do,
So I sat back down and had a beer and felt sorry for myself.
 
Sayin' let her cry if the tears fall down like rain.
Let her sing if it eases all her pain.
Let her go, let her walk right out on me.
And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be, let her be.
Ah.  Oh.  No, no, no, no.

Let her sing if it eases all her pain.
Let her go, let her walk right out on me.
And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be, Ah
 
Last night I tried to leave, cried so much I could not believe
She was the same girl I fell in love with long ago.
She went in the back to get high, 
I sat down on my couch and cried, yellin', 
""Oh, mama, please help me.""
Won't you hold my hand and 
 
Let her cry if the tears fall down like rain.
Let her sing if it eases all her pain.
Let her go, let her walk right out on me.

You were a shadow fading in the dawn

I had been searching 
Searching for my destiny 
High and mighty 
Way above the clouds to find the soul in me 
While you were stuck here with your ball and your chain 
I was too far away to ease your pain 
And all you wanted was to feel you were alive again 
So let me hold you 
Let me hold you like it used to be 
Let me tear down 
Everything that's separating you and me 
For I was blinded but now I can see 
The price you have paid for loving me 
And there is nothing I won't do to try to set you free

To live too near to the flame 
Your eyes can't hide the tears you cried 
When you got too near the flame

Just how many times you fall
For you've seen the freedom through the flame
And you can't resist the call
You've seen the freedom through the flame
And you want to taste it all

I did three bitter years inside 
A friend of mine who set me up 
And he was the one got away with the money. 
But I swore tonight would be the night 
This place couldn't hold me no longer.

I saw the green light come shining

I'm so close, you're right in the sights of my gun, 
I'm nervous, I'm out of control

Nobody can hide you 
I'm standing right beside you 
Watching everything you do. 

I thought that I was strong enough 
To take the screws at their own game 
But they've got tricks they keep in store 
For anyone dreaming of beating the system 
They had me down upon my knees 
Soon I was begging for mercy

My girl she said she'd stick it out 
She kissed my fingers through the grille 
She whispered she'd love no-one else 
But then she took off with a creep from the south side

But you won't be here when they creep in tomorrow

That someone else's dreams don't get you nowhere. 
So shut the suitcase, kiss the year goodbye 
Don't let nobody stop you at the doorway 

And close the shutters on this empty room 
Where these crazy dreams come crawling to devour you 
And head on out across that line 
Where she's been waiting all this time 

And tell her that you want her there forever.

Can hardly bear to wait another minute

To you, only to you, no one but you 
This power takes me from the place I belong 
To where only the strong get through

It slips right out of view
Though there are days the light can flicker and fade

Paul Brady,"A night in television wonderland
Just one more fairytale about some rich bitch 
Lying by the swimming pool
It's the golden school
And life is easy when you make the rules
Last Friday was the first time
It only took about a half a minute 
On the stairway
It was child's play
The odds turn out even 
When you give up believing in the...

[Chorus]
Cold law, steel claw, 
Try to get on board; you find the lock is on the door 
Well, I say, no way!
Don't try to keep me out or there'll be hell to pay! 
I don't know who's right or who's wrong
But it doesn't really matter
When you're crawling in the gutter 
It's a see-saw 
A long, hot battle with the cold law 
Is what you get for messing with the 
Steel claw

The politicians have forgotten this place
Except for a flying visit in a black Mercedes 
At election time
They cross the line
And everybody runs to watch the pantomime
If they could see what's going on around here
So many people hanging on to the edge 
Crying out for revolution! 
Retribution!
The odds turn out even 
When you give up believing in the cold law

[Chorus]

Sometimes I think I'm going crazy 
Sometimes I do a line; makes me laugh
Makes me want to take a joy ride 
On the high tide
Sometimes I'm contemplating suicide 
Meanwhile Bobby's out in Benidorm
I know he's making out with some sweet senorita 
And they go dancing
In the moonlight
The odds turn out even 
When you give up the believing in the cold law

Paul Brady,"Inside a second you can hear a flower growing in the wind
But does it reach you when there's darkness all around
How many days will this go on
How many thoughts can I obsess
Why do we come apart
And watch it all go down

Take me away I can't deny it
And all that I want is to touch the sky
Show me the way a simple mind
And no one can say it can't be done

I see it shining on the sun
A road that leads beyond this place
A way to push aside the walls that block our path
If time can truly be a lie
There's nothing left but you and I
Denying everything and shattering the glass

Take me away I can't deny it
And all that I want is to touch the sky
Show me the way a simple mind
And no one can say it can't be done

Out of mind out of time
All alone stuck at home
Can't decide Full of pride
I want it all
Left to be only me
Far away everyday

I want it all

Symbolize separation
Let me be set me free

Take me away I can't deny it

Show me the way a simple mind

 Like news that's too good to be true 
 You want to get in on the action 
 And make believe it came from you 
 And then you start to lift the tempo

 But in the noise and the confusion 
 You're losing contact with the sound 
 Of the airwaves... 
 Check the message on the airwaves 
 All you need is on the airwaves 
 Don't let it slip away. 
 A lover slips into your orbit 
 To show an easier way through 
 But like a fool you think her mission 
 Is to supply the missing parts of you 
 And then you find she can't deliver 
 Your world is turning upside down

 You're losing contact with the sound 
 Of the airwaves...

 The moment you cut the cable 
 The rest of the world goes drifting by 
 Leaving you high and dry 
 Your love was there waiting to slip me the key 
 It's just that behind my curtain 
 Your love wasn't getting through to me 
 And setting my spirit free 
 What started me thinking of changing the plan, 
 What took me so long to find out 
 That you only want me as I am? 
 See how the silence sends it on down to you 
 Now all you need is to believe it's true 
 This lesson is over, this message got through 
 I'm turning the corner 
 You know that I'm coming back to you 
 To be the one I can be 
 I know you told me but I had to find it out for myself 
 Oh sweet baby I cried 
 And when I saw the way I hurt you 
 Saw the tears in your eyes

 And I never make the same one twice

So much waiting

But I don't mind this hurt I feel 
Troubling my soul 
Got my shoulder to the wheel of heartbreak 
Feel it giving 
Feel it give! 
Feel it rock 'n' roll!

Opening the way for the delivery. 

Who can keep from wondering just how long is long... 
Who can have the nerve to say forever? 
Who can find a reason why something right is wrong...

Paul Brady,"Downtown disco, out on the floor, 
 He's been there a hundred times before, 
 Looking for some pretty high class fool to play with 
 Back in his place when he pours out the wine 
 And the crystal snowflakes stand in line - 
 She won't ever find a faster way to heaven. 
 You can find him any night 
 Standing in the upstage light, 
 Waiting for some easy act to follow - 
 Watch him move in perfect time 
 Memorizing all his lines 
 Roll up! Roll up! see the Great Pretender 
 Dinner party, table for two - 
 Video turns to midnight blue, 
 He says ""do you like to do it this way?"" 
 Black satin sheets edged in guilt, 
 Whispered lies underneath the quilt - 
 He'll do anything a woman wants, 
 ''cause he's built for pleasure 
 You can find him etc

 We last, all night",The Great Pretender
Paul Brady,"So many years of reaching out for words unspoken
So many nights of saving love for no-one there
So many hearts that break when promises are broken
How long before you find the answer to your prayer
It's the awakening... It's the awakening...
How high the road that leads us on from Sweet Surrender
How soft the wind that waits to speed us on our way
How young and foolish were we still to be pretending
That we could make our love grow any other way
It's the awakening	(Tonight you see her with different eyes)
It's the awakening	(Tonight you know where your happiness lies)

(Chorus)
And if you're looking for the answers to your questions
Look inside
And if you're wondering why your heart is always restless
Look inside

Could you and I forget the times when we were strangers
When all the beauty that we shared was swept away
When every avenue we walked would lead to nowhere
Could you and I forget the tears of yesterday
It's the awakening	(And you can leave all the sadness behind)
It's the awakening	(And now you're ready to find peace of mind)
It's the awakening.

(Chorus)

And if you're looking for the answers to your questions
Look inside
And if you're wondering why your heart is always restless
Look inside
It's the awakening
And you can dry all the tears from your eyes
It's the awakening
And you don't have to invent a disguise
It's the awakening
Tonight you know where your happiness lies
It's the awakening
The sun is up and the future is bright

Some dream world of a different kind
I know this rhythm we've been moving to is way too slow
Each time our bodies aresupposed to meet
I'm here still missing a beat
And when I look at you I see in your eyes
We're still dancing to a different tune

Take me to your dreaming place
Open up my eyes
Let me see what it takes to be
Your lover in disguise
show me how I do those things
That make you want to stay
'Cause I'll Go crazy if I don't find 
The words I gotta say 
To steal your heart away

I'll buy you diamonds, buy you golden rings
All kinds of Beautiful things
But that don't matter to a lover with a Restless heart 
Cause you still want to wake up to a Different scene 
Some screen gem like the one in your dream
And leave me standing like a foolin' the wings
Still waiting for a part to Play

Take me to your dreaming place 
Open up my eyes
Let me see what it takes to be
Your lover in disguise
Show me? How I can do those things 
That make you want to stay
Cause I'll go crazy if I don't find 
The words I gotta say 
To steal your heart away

I know you think she's right for you
That she's in tune with what you do
That she can touch you deep inside
Where all your deepest feelings lie
But I got something you should know
Before she starts to hurt you so 
You can bet your life she's gonna hurt you

And maybe you think that it's alright
To leave me waiting every night
To put me down in company
In front of everyone we see
To take my loving when it's free 
And then to throw it back at me

Well baby, I just can't stand it
Cause I can be the one for you
And I can make your dreams come true
And I can love you like she can
Cause fancy clothes don't make no woman 
Believe me baby
I got what it takes to make you feel good

And maybe you think a girl should be
As perfect as a girl can be
To love you when your feeling down 
And miss you when you're not around
Well I can't be that one for you
I can only be the one that loves you

That I don't share your point of view

Of the world inside of you
But that kind of blue world

It's going to take a revolution

And don't turn your head away
For your kind of blue world

Time after time, I try to find you...
Then in some place, suddenly I will see your face
But when I get near, you disappear...

Soul child, do you belong in my life?
Do I still keep building my world around you?
Dreams of you in my life forever.

Trying to get a handle on this heart of mine

How to find a way to end these wars with you?

Were we just fools to ever start?
Would it make sense for us to part?

Churning out this hurting deep inside of me

And I'm ducking and I'm diving
And I'm running and I'm hiding

Making me blind I could not see
That you were the perfect one for me

 Of everything that's gone before

 How could this just be an illusion? 
 We play out our part

 The future is a shooting star 
 We try to ignore 
 what's happened before 
 The storybook of who we are 
 Till suddenly one and one makes three 
 And lovers are losers 
 You and me drowning in confusion 
 Love hurts 
 Even when the love is strong 
 Love hurts even while the love goes on 
 Turning these pages in my heart 
 Over and over 
 Still only leads to one conclusion

 Can we just end this fight 
 Make out what's wrong from right 
 Or see with second sight 
 The reason why?

They say the skies of Lebanon are burning.
Those mighty cedars bleeding in the heat. 
They're showing pictures on the television. 
Women and children dying in the street 
And we're still at it in our own place. 
Still trying to reach the future through the past. 
Still trying to carve tomorrow from a tombstone... 

Chorus 

But Hey! Don't listen to me!.
This wasn't meant to be no sad song. 
We've heard too much of that before. 
Right now I only want to be here with you. 
Till the morning dew comes falling. 
I want to take you to the island. 
And trace your footprints in the sand. 
And in the evening when the sun goes down 
We'll make love to the sound of the ocean 

They're raising banners over by the markets 
Whitewashing slogans on the shipyard walls 
Witchdoctors praying for a mighty showdown 
No way our holy flag is gonna fall 
Up here we sacrifice our children 
To feed the worn-out dreams of yesterday 
And teach them dying will lead us into glory... 

Repeat chorus 

Now I know us plain folks don't see all the story. 
And I know this peace and love's just copping out. 
And I guess these young boys dying in the ditches. 
Is just what being free is all about. 
And how this twisted wreckage down on main street. 
Will bring us all together in the end. 
And we'll go marching down the road to freedom....

Who am I 
What do I know

Well I 
Got a feeling that even when the music ends 
Goodbye doesn't say it all
There's another play 
When the curtain falls
We're all rehearsing for forever but until then
Whoah oh oh I guess
That just the way this old world works
Moments of heaven mixed with moments of hurt and
I'll be waiting til we are together again
Everything's falling apart right now
But with all of the hope that my faith allows
I'll be waiting til we are together again
The time we had was touched by god
And I'm thankful but I had a thought

I wondered why something so perfect ever has to end
I falled and prayed and screamed out loud
But the silence never told me how
How to keep on living til we are together again
Whoah oh oh

That's just the way this old world works
Moments of heaven mixed with moments of hurt and

Just like they said it would be
And I can tell by the way that she's all over him
She must be all over me

I guess I should have known by the way she's been acting
This is just how it would be
All I ever wanted was her love everlasting
Looks like she wants to be free
And I can tell by the way that she's all over him
She must be all over me

I'm standing here and my heart goes to pieces
Along with all of my dreams

Now I'm reaching out to hold you
As you turn around to go

I should've been more careful
I should've seen the signs
While all was calm, I guess
I should've read between the lines

So, now I'm standin' in the cold, hard rain
Instead of with you safe and warm
A fool who took your love for granted
In the calm before the storm

So, I'm standin' here alone
I've never felt like this before
Can't believe my heart's been broken
Just like waves against the shore

I could always love and leave them
I was the first one out the door
I can't get used to the idea
Not being with you anymore

A card that explains how much your love means
A table for two with soft candlelight
The words ""I love you,"" somewhere in the night

If you wanted songs
Then I meant to sing
I'd give you the world
If you'd give mine back
What I didn't do
I meant to do that

Late in the night, nothing to say
Maybe a call to talk anyway
A letter or two with some words that rhyme
To promise you love, for now and all time

Then I meant to sing

While other hearts are holdin' on
While other loves are growin' strong
My heart has a history of lettin' go

Through the door
How easy you captured their eyes
And it wasn't your dress and it wasn't my drink

You lit up the room with your smile
When you sat down beside me I felt like a king
Completely taken by you
And I was sorry for every man in this world
Who doesn't know you like I do

Oh, I love how you move and the way your hair flows
But there's so much more I want you to know
I love how it feels when I look in your eyes
'Cause you're even more beautiful on the inside

You've stayed by my side through some very hard times
And you've always been faithful and true
You're a picture of grace under pressure

But if you really hold me tight

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

To see what I could see

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair.

Paul Brown,"I went down to the river, sat beneath the willow tree
The dew dropped on those willow leaves and it rolled right down on me
And that's the reason I've got those weeping willow blues

I went up on the mountain, high as any girl could stand
And looked down on the mean town that took away my lovin' man
And that's the reason I've got those weepin' willow blues

I heard the whistle blowing, the fireman ring the bell 
They're taking away that willow tree that give me this weeping spell
And that's the reason I've got those weeping willow blues

When you're broken hearted and your man is out of town
Go to the river, take the chains and sit down
And if he don't come back to you, I'll tell you what to do
Just jump right overboard, 'cause he ain't no more to you

Folks I love my man, I kiss him morning noon and night
I wash his clothes and keep him clean and try to treat him right

The way he treats me, girls, he'll do the same to you

Knowing someday I'd grow strong 

Without you without you 
A sailor lost at sea 
Without you woman 
The world comes down on me 

Without you in my life 
I'd slowly wilt and die 
But with you by my side 
You're the reason I'm alive 
But with you in my life 
You're the reason I'm alive 
But without you, without you

I could face a mountain 
But I could never climb alone 
I could start another day 
But how many, just don't know 
You're the reason the sun shines down 
And the nights, they don't grow cold 
Only you that I'll hold when I'm young 
Only you as we grow old

Without you in my life 
I'd slowly wilt and die 
But with you by my side 
You're the reason I'm alive 
But with you in my life 
You're the reason I'm alive 
But without you, without you",Without You

Your future looks better than ya past if you present with the man 
You betta BREATHE 

You niggaz can't share my air 
Or walk a mile in the pair I wear 
And I'm gettin better year by year 
Like they say Juan do 
Cops couldn't smell me if you brought the canines through 
And I pace myself 
I know these money hungry bitches want to taste my wealth 
But I keep em' on a diet 
Embrace they health 
Or either keep em' on a quiet 
And space myself 
And just take a deep breath 
I got em' grabbin' they chest 
'cause it's hurtin' em' to see Fab in his best 
And they in they worst 
They rather see me lay in the hearse than lay in the back
And I ain't just layin a verse 
I'm sayin the facts 
I came back with some sicka stones 
That got these broke niggaz lookin at me like they chokin' on a chicken bone 
Every chick I bone 
Can't leave the dick alone

'cause the cops want to lock and harass us 
And make it hard to BREATHE 
They has to react 
Like havin' a asthma attack 
When they see the plasma in back 
You dudes are wheezin' behind me 
My flow is like a coupe, breezin at 90 
That's the reason they signed me 
It's quick metaphors and hard punches on the cuts 
Feels somethin' like hard punches to the gut 
How I address the haters and under estimaters 
And ride up on them like they escalators 
They shook up and hooked up to respirators 
On they last breath talking to investigators 
I'm a breath of fresh air 
And a fresh pair

Meanwhile I try to act so nonchalant
I feel a summer's night with a magic moon

Standin' right along side of you
Wish I could show you how much I care

Till she's here I'm an unhappy man

I'm just a hopeless case

To have her back, hold her next to me

With tears and muddy water
And bits of broken heart

Of a love been torn apart

I live on a battlefield
Though one where not one
Single drop of blood has spilled
Is no less horryfying

Of a bygone situation
Lie shattered, torn and battered
And scattered all around

With tears and muddy water
And bits of broken heart
All around, there is desolation
Scenes of devastation
Of a love been torn apart

You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye

So we open up a quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts

So Don't yield to the fortunes
You sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective
On a different day
And if you don't give up, and don't give in
You may just be O.K.

I'm sure I heard his echo
In my baby's new born tears

There's no turnin' back
No more covering up

You know there's no...
No one to blame
Because we found love again",For Once in Our Lives
Paul Carrack,"I was standing all alone against the world outside 
You were searching for a place to hide 
Lost and lonely, now you've given me the will to survive 

When we're hungry, love will keep us alive 
Don't you worry, sometimes you've just got to let it ride 
The world is changing right before your eyes 
Now I've found you, there's no more emptiness inside 

When we're hungry, love will keep us alive 
I would die for you, climb the highest mountain 
Baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do for you 

Now I've found you, there's no more emptiness inside 
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive 

I would die for you",Love Will Keep Us Alive
Paul Carrack,"The same thoughts going through my head
So many things better left unsaid
Well I'm telling you baby, there's no easy way out

Dreams may shatter, tears may fall
So hard to make any sense at all
Well I'm tellin' you darlin' there's no easy way out

All I can do is wait, I don't care how long it takes

Baby I just want to be standing by your side
Whenever you need whatever I can do

Don't worry bout losing face
You know my heart is in the right place
Well I'm telling you baby there's no easy way out
You know it's only a matter of time
Then everything's gonna work out fine
But I'm tellin' you darlin' there's no easy way out

All I can do is wait, I don't care how long it takes

Baby I, just want to be standing by your side
Whenever you need someone to hold you tight

Try to understand that every word I say is true
Tell me what else can I do?
I just want to be
",No Easy Way Out
Paul Carrack,"Outside in the pouring rain
I walked the lonely streets and searched in vain
Every corner of every street
And every doorway where we used to meet
As I turned to walk away I could swear I saw your face

Long into the night I see
Shadows dancing alone with me
I know it must be
Nothing more than a memory

I try to keep my hurt inside
With some resemblance of my broken pride
I've done everything that I can do
I can't face the thought of losing you
And as I turn to walk away
I thought I saw your face again

Long into the night

People say that I'm crazy
I'm being weak when I should be strong
I've got to pull myself back together before too long
",Nothing More Than a Memory
Paul Carrack,"Since you ask me what it takes to love me
Get it straight right from the start
You've got to move me got to get this to me
Keep it coming right from the heart

Then oh oh oh my my my
I will never let you down
Oh oh oh my my my lovers make this world go around
You've got to keep it uncomplicated
If you see my point of view
Plain and simply stated you must do what you must do

A lot of people spend their lifetime searching
Getting more and having less
You and me though
Now we've got this working every move is happiness

Then oh oh oh my my my

Talkers talking, preachers preaching
Making life a misery
If they could feel every night what we feel
They'd wish they were you and me

Then oh oh oh my my my
",Oh Oh Oh My My My
Paul Carrack,"You might think I keep my distance 
You might think I have no plans to stay 
You might think I have no weakness 
But you don't understand a word I say 
I tell you honestly 
You know you mean the world to me 
And if you're ever in need 
I'll tell you where I'm gonna be 

Oh yeah, alright 
Well, I'm only a breath away 
Oh yeah, don't cry 
'Cause I'm only a breath away 
Only a breath away 

Never been a single moment 
Never even been a day gone by 
When I haven't felt your presence 
Deep within my heart and in my mind 

No matter where you are 
I'll be with you constantly 
And when you're feeling alone 
All you have to do is think of me",Only a Breath Away
Paul Carrack,"They say in time all the truth comes to light 
When you can see past the wrong and the right 
There`s a feelin` inside stronger than pride 
Finds me every lonely night 
Well I have searched the past in my mind 
How we failed to see the danger signs 
Well one good reason why we let our love die 
Is something that I`ve failed to find 

Somewhere in your heart 
There`s a lonely part that beats for me 
Somewhere in your broken heart 
There`s a lonely part that beats for me 

Well I have cried till my tears have turned cold 
I`d trade my pride for peace in my soul 
Please don`t make me pay for the rest of my days 
For emotions that ran out of control 
We`ve all but closed the door on our past 
And this one chance may well be our last 
So before you decide one last look inside 
Is all my shattered dreams can ask 

Somewhere in your heart",Somewhere in Your Heart
Paul Carrack,"Looking back over my shoulder
I can see that look in your eye
I never dreamed it could be over
I never wanted to say goodbye
 
Looking back over my shoulder
With an aching deep in my heart
I wish that we were starting over
Oh instead of drifting so far apart
 
Everybody told me you were leaving
Funny I should be the last to know
Baby please tell me that I'm dreaming
I just never want to let you go
 
Looking back over my shoulder
I can see that look in your eye
Turning my heart over and over
I never wanted to say goodbye
 
I don't mind everybody laughing
But it's enough to make a grown man cry
'Cause I can feel you slipping through my fingers
I don't even know the reason why
 
Every day it's a losing battle
Just to smile and hold my head up high
Could it be that we belong together
Baby won't you give me one more try
One more try
 
Looking back over my shoulder
I can see that look in your eye
I never dreamed it could be over
I never wanted to say goodbye
 
Looking back over my shoulder
Oh with an aching feeling inside
Cutting me up, deeper and deeper
Fills me with a sadness that I can't hide
 
Looking back over my shoulder
I can see that look in your eye
I never dreamed no no it could be over
I never wanted to say goodbye
 
Looking back over my shoulder
I can see that look in your eye",Over My Shoulder [*]
Paul Carrack,"Beautiful World, you taught me to remember 
All the feelings, I lost along the way 
I was afraid, alone in my confusion 
Running and hiding `stead of living from day to day 
When we were walking, we touched the summer flowers 
And I saw the wonder, oh in a young child`s eye 
Well I looked around and saw how truly grateful 
That I should be for all the love I`ve found 

Beautiful World well you shook me to my senses 
And opened my eyes to the love inside of me 
It`s up to me, if I can always believe 
In the way I see it now, what a Beautiful World 
It would always be",Beautiful World
Paul Carrack,"Is it just me or does it seem so different tonight? 
Here with you now I feel that everything is right 
Come to me now 
There's no reason to hesitate 
'Cause I don't know, I don't know 
How much longer I can wait 

[Chorus]
Close to me 
Darlin', I want to feel your heart beating next to mine 
Close to me 
'Cause deep inside I know that you're the one I've wanted 
All this time 

Is it just me or can you feel a magic in the air? 
I close my eyes, and I can feel it everywhere 
Come next to me; hear the words that I want to say 
Well, I don't know, I don't know 
How you make me feel this way

Before you say something you might regret 
I know something's missing 
But I can't begin to accept what you said 
Maybe, you can show me 
Exactly where I'm goin' wrong 
'Cause lately I've been thinking 
Maybe I've been 'round here too long 

[Chorus]
If you'd ever needed someone in your life 
Maybe then you'd know 
Why my heart just wants you to stay 
But my head tells me lo let her go 
If you'd ever needed someone 

One way or another 
Whatever I do, it seems you criticize 
Is there any wonder
The hurt that I feel is so thinly disguised?

I can't help but notice 
Little things that tell me so much 
Is it only a matter of time 
Before I'm missing your tender touch? 

[Chorus] 

If you'd put yourself in my place 
You could never say what's gone is gone 
If you'd ever needed someone",If You'd Ever Needed Someone
Paul Carrack,"I need to hear it, One word from your heart 
All you ever give me, is it goes without saying 
You leave it unspoken, the message is loud and clear 
Here in the silence where it goes without saying 
Well it goes without saying 
I'm feeling like a fool for hanging on 
And if it goes without saying much longer I'm gone 
You take it for granted, as if I can read your mind 
I'm left with a question that never gets answered 
I don't want this feeling of wondering where I stand 
I won't even ask you if you're gonna tell me 
It goes without saying 
How am I supposed to know what's going on 
If it goes without saying much longer I'm gone 
Why should I cry?, Why lie to myself any longer 
If it goes without saying, I'm feeling like a fool 
For hanging on 
When it goes without saying, baby there's no way to know 
What's going on 
If it goes without saying much longer, I don't know how I 
Can say it any stronger if it goes without saying much 
Longer, 
I'm gone",It Goes Without Saying
Paul Carrack,"There's a light that shines on 
Everyone tonight 
But it seems we're just too blind to see 
There's a love that's so deep 
We should never want 
But do we really know what we need? 

[Chorus]
I never thought there would be 
Someone who'd mean so much to me 
In my mind there was no 
Such thing as perfect love 
But now I'm holding you tonight 
And I can see that you were right 
To believe there can be perfect love 

You can live your whole life trying to avoid 
Being hurt, like you've been hurt before 
Then one day you may wake up 
And feel a love so strong 
That you can't hold it back anymore 

[Chorus]

Ever since you called my name 
Nothing's ever been the same 
I want to give my heart to you 
And your perfect love so true 
Oh, your perfect love 
But now you're here with me tonight 
And I can see that you were right 
To believe there can be perfect love",Perfect Love
Paul Carrack,"[Chorus]
I'm still crazy for you
Everything that you do 
Just want to keep you satisfied 
Every trick in the book, girl, by hook or by crook 
Gonna keep you satisfied 

You've become an addiction somehow I can't resist 
Let me make a prediction
Now I know what I've missed 
In my heart there's a whole lot of lovin' 

A feelin' I can't deny 
I can't ignore if I wanted
So, baby, why should I try?

[Chorus]

Well, my heart still pounds like a hammer 
Every time you get close to me 
And my pulse starts to race 
At the thought of your embrace 
And my mind blows naturally 
Don't think I take you for granted 
That's something I'd never do 
Whatever you need to be happy 
Just ask, and I'll give it to you

[Chorus]",Satisfied
Paul Carrack,"Baby you push me a little too hard
Sometimes you pin me down
Catch me off my guard
And when I get outta line
It feels like you squeeze my mind
Baby you twist my words
Like only you know how

My heart can't find a rhythm
It's missing every other beat

Gimme some kinda love baby
Make it like it used to be
Gimme some kinda love baby
I need you right next to me

Sometimes I pushed you
A little too much
Sometimes I crossed that line
And I made you blush
I got a pain I can't nullify
'cause you stop me every single time
We've got to move before it
Becomes too late
You're testing my emotions
Tell me what is there to prove

Gimme some kinda love baby
Make it like it used to be
Gimme some kinda love baby
I ain't so hard to please

Paul Carrack,"Say nothing, I will understand 
I'm on your side; I'm your biggest fan 
You don't need to tell me any precious lies 
'Cause I won't believe them when I look in your eyes

Every kiss from your lips sends a message 
Every touch of your hand tells me so 
In my heart I'm already missing you 
Darlin', I know it's time to let go 

I'm tryin' to convince myself 
When I tell you I will just find somebody else 
'Cause I know inside me, it will only be 
Because I realise you'd truly do the same for me 

[Chorus]

Maybe I just need to get used to it, and I'll be fine 
'Cause I think I recognise 
One by one those tell-tale signs 

Don't worry
You could never hide anything from me
I know you're cryin' deep inside 

[Chorus x 2]",Time to Let Go
Paul Carrack,"I admit it, this time I was wrong 
Anybody can make a mistake 
I overdid it and I can't complain 
If someone's taken my place 
It ain't the first time, it won't be the last 
That I find my life in dissaray 
No use regretting, it's all in the past 
So tell me what can I say 
Is there any point, goin' on about it 
When you know that I can do nothin' right 
I don't know that talkin' it over will change, 
The way I'm feeling tonight 
I used to wake up, jump out of my bed 
With a great big smile on my face 
I was the business, no one could deny 
Now I've fallen from grace 
I just need a chance to forget about it 
Do you really care who was wrong or right 
I don't know that talkin it over will change 
The way I'm feeling tonight 
So if you want your freedom, I won't stand in your way 
Cos I've got my pride, and I won't beg you to stay 
Maybe one day I will write a book about it 
I'll put everything down in black and white 
I don't know that talkin it over will change 
The way I'm feeling tonight

I'm so glad I have something to believe in

And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again

That's where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to hide our wrong
You and me at the dark end of the street

We have to pay for what we stole
It's a sin, and we know it's wrong
But our love keeps coming on strong
Steal away to the dark end of the street

And when the daylight hour rolls around
If by chance we should walk downtown
If we should meet, just walk on by
Oh darling, please don't cry
Tonight we'll meet at the dark end of the street

Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief

The girl has found another and gone away.
With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room.
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain,

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears,
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,
Let it rain, let it rain.
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes.

I know that I'm a hostage

Stilted conversations

We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts

Just like a wolf in sheep's clothing, the devil came in disguise

That we always hold dear
Good old summertime
With the birds and the trees'es
And sweet scented breezes

Then you are in clover
And life is one beautiful rhyme
No trouble annoying
Each one is enjoying
The good old summertime

In the good old summertime
In the good old summertime
Strolling through a shady lane
With your baby mine
You hold her hand and she holds yours
And that's a very good sign
That she's your tootsey-wootsey
In the good, old summertime

Oh, to swim in the pool
You'd play hooky from school
Good old summertime
You'd play ""ring-a-rosie""
With Jim, Kate and Josie
Good old summertime
Those days full of pleasure
We now fondly treasure
When we never thought it a crime
To go stealing cherries
With faces brown as berries

Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

Paul de Leeuw,"Rood is al lang het rood niet meer
Het rood van rode rozen
De kleur van liefde van weleer
Lijkt door de haat gekozen

Dat mooie rood was ooit voor mij
Een kleur van passie en van wijn
Ik wil haar terug, die mooie tijd
Maar zij lijkt lang vervlogen

En alle beelden op TV
Van bloed en oorlog om ons heen
Werken daar ook niet echt aan mee

Dus ik neem heel bewust het besluit
De krant leg ik weg
En de TV gaat uit

Vandaag is rood de kleur van jouw lippen
Vandaag is rood wat rood hoort te zijn
Vandaag is.. rood van rood wit blauw
Van heel mijn hart voor jou
Schreeuw van de roodbedekte daken dat ik van je hou
Vandaag is rood gewoon weer liefde tussen jou en mij

Ik loop de deur door en naar buiten waar de zon begint te schijnen
Laat alles achter, kijk vooruit en met mijn laatste rooie cent
Koop ik een veel te grote bos met hondervijftig rode rozen
Een voor elk jaar waarvan ik hoop dat jij nog bij me bent.

Vandaag is rood de kleur van jouw lippen
Vandaag is rood wat rood hoort te zijn
Vandaag is.. rood van rood wit blauw
Van heel mijn hart voor jou
Schreeuw van de roodbedekte daken dat ik van je hou
Vandaag is rood gewoon weer liefde tussen jou en mij

En nu sta je hier zo voor me
De rode avondzon streelt jouw gezicht
Je bent een wonder voor me
Denk ik, terwijl een doorn mijn vinger prikt

Rood is mijn bloed dat valt op de grond
En even lijk ik verloren
Maar jij brengt mijn vingers naar je mond
En je kust ze
En ik weet


Vandaag is rood de kleur van jouw lippen
Vandaag is rood wat rood hoort te zijn
Vandaag is.. rood van rood wit blauw
Van heel mijn hart voor jou
Schreeuw van de roodbedekte daken dat ik van je hou
Vandaag is rood gewoon weer liefde tussen jou en mij

Vandaag? is rood
Gooi de loper uit
En drink een goed glas wijn
Pluk de dag want het kan zo ineens de laatste zijn
Vandaag is rood gewoon weer liefde tussen jouw en mij

Vandaag staat rood weer voor de liefde
Tussen jou en mij

Hallo boppers

De grote autowegen slingeren zich over bergen en door valleien

Omdat de cabine van mijn truck bijna 25 jaar lang mijn huis is geweest
Het zou voor mij vreemd zijn een geregeld leven te moeten leiden, tja
Tja, ik herinner me mij mijn eerste truck nog die ik bestuurde
Ik was zo trots als een pauw en popelde om hem aan mijn vrouw en mijn
zoontje te laten zien
Mijn jongen was net zo onder de indruk als toen hij voor het eerst ..
Als toen hij voor het eerst sneeuw zag
Hij kon nog maar net een paar woordjes zeggen en zijn vaste begroeting was
altijd
Giddy up go pappa, giddy up go
Daarom gaf ik mijn truck die naam, giddy up go
Een slecht leven was het niet ondanks het feit dat ik het altijd druk had
Het was... het was een jaar of zes erna toen ik op een dag thuis kwam
Maar d'are niemand wa.. 
Het was een jaar of zes erna toen ik op een dag thuis kwam en er niemand
was
Mijn vr.. mijn vrouw was met de kleine jongen vertrokken
Ik kon er niet achterkomen waarheen nie.. waarheen
Niemand wist het
Vanaf die dag was ik alleen met mijn oude giddy up go
In de vele koffietentjes langs de weg had ik in de loop van de tijd veel
vrienden gemaakt
Niemand plaagde mij met die bijzondere naam op mijn kar
Ik had ze over mijn knul verteld en wat zijn reactie was toen hij voor het
eerst mijn truck zag, giddy up go

word ingehaald door een splinternieuwe dieseltruck

Paul de Leeuw,"Ik was een schuchtere naieverd
Van de liefde wist ik niets
En opeens riep zij: dag lieverd
En sprong achter op mijn fiets
En we reden langs de zee
En d'are haren waren blond
En ik vond het onbegrijpelijk mooi
Dat iemand mij een lieverd vond

Fietsten naar een rustig plekje
Met dat indrukwekkend kind
Naar een afgelegen stekje
Net een beetje uit de wind
En toen zei ze weer iets liefs
Wat ik niet helemaal verstond
Maar ik vond het onbegrijpelijk mooi
Dat iemand mij een lieverd vond

Ze droeg een vrolijk strooie hoedje
Toen ze daar zo naast mij zat
En ik dacht, dat kind dat doet je
Ik dacht: dat kind dat doet je wat
Ik had het nauwelijks gedacht
Of ze kuste mij op mijn mond
En ik vond het onbegrijpelijk mooi
Dat iemand mij een lieverd vond

Ik was niet bepaald een echte vlottert
Ik kreeg het warm en ik kreeg het koud
Ik weet nog dat ik heb gestotterd
Wat zijn aan zee de zoenen zout
En ik hoor haar lieve lach
Nog volop schallen in het rond
En ik vond het onbegrijpelijk mooi
Dat iemand mij een lieverd vond

Ik heb heel stil naar haar geluisterd
De lieve dingen die ze zei
Toen heeft de zee mij ingefluisterd
Kom nog een beetje dichterbij
En toen hebben wij gevrijd
Tot de maan te schijnen stond
En ik vond het onbegrijpelijk mooi
Dat ik haar een echte lieverd vond",Lieverd
Paul de Leeuw,"Vogeltje, wat zing je vroeg
Is de nacht niet lang genoeg
Nee, de nacht is altijd veel te kort
Omdat het tegen vieren
Zo ’s morgens tegen vieren
Omdat het dan pas echt gezellig wordt

’t Is gisteren weer eens uit de hand gelopen
Het kwam als altijd heerlijk onverwacht
We zouden effetjes een slokkie kopen
Maar effetjes dat werd een hele nacht
En tegen het ochtendgloren stond die hele zotte troep
Van bassen en tenoren luid te zingen op de stoep
Een agent kwam voorbij

Ik had allang gehoord: “De hoogste tijd”
Maar al die kreten mochten toch niet baten
D’r zaten al weer mensen aan ’t ontbijt
We zongen voor de laatste maal een carnavalsrefrein
En kwamen de melkboer tegen op het lege, stille plein
En die zei en die zei

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for

The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it

That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending

You know I'm yours for just the taking

So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night

Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin

So I imagine my heart with you
See what imagination can do

Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light

You make me smile with my heart, 
Your looks are laughable, un-photo-graphical,

Is your mouth a little weak? 
When you open it to speak, are you smiling?

Darling your eyes are asking, ""Will the flame burn out?""
Well, no one is sure of sun shine, no one is sure of dawn,
But I am sure my love will live on and  on.
I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Beyond the years, 
'Til day is night, 'til wrong is right,
'Til birds refuse to sing,

He/She may be near or ever so far away
But I'll have none except the one I love

Or if it's dark out there;
Somehow that's just the way it is,
And I don't really care!

I go to this or that place,
I seem alive and well,
My head is just a hat place,
My breast an empty shell,
And I've a faded dream to sell.

All alone and all at sea,
Why does nobody care for me?
When there's no love to hold my love,
Why is my heart so frail,
Like a ship without a sail?

Out on the ocean,
Sailors can use a chart;
I'm on the ocean,
Guided by just a lonely heart!

Still alone, all at sea,
Still there's no-one to care for me.
When there's no hand to hold my hand,
Life is a loveless tale,
Like a ship without a sail.

To the monotone of the evening's drone I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night you're sio close to me!
All through the night,
From a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy!

When dawn comes to waken me,

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

Funny, but here's that rainy day

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret

Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

I said, be careful, his bowtie is really a camera

Pressed in organdy
Clothed in crinoline of smoky burgundy
Softer than the rain

Down past the shop displays
I heard cathedral bells
Tripping down the alley ways
As I walked on

And when you ran to me
Your cheeks flushed with the night
We walked on frosted fields
Of juniper and lamplight

Lost in their overcoats
Waiting for the sunset
The sounds of the city sifting through trees
Settle like dust
On the shoulders of the old friends

Sharing a park bench quietly?
How terribly strange to be seventy

Memory brushes the same years
Silently sharing the same fear

A time of innocence
A time of confidences

That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

Paul Desmond,"Won't you stop and take
A little time out with me
Just take five
Stop your busy day
And take the time out
To see if I'm alive

Though I'm going out of my way
Just so I can pass by each day
Not a single word do we say
It's a pantomime and not a play

Still, I know our eyes often meet
I feel tingles down to my feet
When you smile, that's much too discreet
Sends me on my way

Wouldn't it be better
Not to be so polite
You could offer a light
Start a little conversation now
It's alright, just take five

Paul Desmond,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Star Dust
Paul Desmond,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song

Some day my happy arms will hold you
And some day I'll know that moment divine

When all the things you are, are mine

Paul Desmond,"On every tree there sits a bird, singing a song of love
On every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard 
Could break my heart without a word singing a song of love
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
 
A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings

Paul Di'Anno,"There is a sound from the kitchen
And it's a sound he's heard a thousand times before
When he hears his mother crying
He runs away and hides inside his room

But there is no escaping
The anger in his fathers voice
And when the tears are falling
He falls down to his knees and prays

Just hold me and love me
Touch this child of love
And try your best to save this
Broken home

His little arms are black and blue
And there's a little cut right under his eye
Every night he lies awake
And from downstairs the fighting starts again

Have you forgot the reason
Why this little child was born?
Cause if you go on fighting
You'll destroy this family

Just hold him and love him
Touch this child of love
And try your best to save this
Broken home

Stop fighting, stop hurting
Try to love again
And do your best to save this
Broken home

If you ever hold him tight
Let him feel your love again
You will make him smile again

Hold him, love him
And touch this child of love
And try your best to save this

I'm goin' way down south
Way down where I can be free
Ain't no one gonna find me
Ain't no hang-man gonna
He ain't gonna put a rope around me
You better believe it right now
I gotta go now

Hey, Joe
You better run on down
Goodbye everybody
Hey hey Joe",Hey Joe
Paul Gilbert,"Kill
Kill the pain
Put it out
Of its misery

I
Can't explain
All the doubt
All the history

[Chorus]
So I'm sitting here
With a can of beer
Pour it in my ear
Just to see
If it makes it down
To relieve the frown
Of an angry bumblebee
Inside me

Friends
Come and go
As you know
They've got lives to lead

I
Watch them go
Carry on
On my own two feet

And I'm standing here
With a can of beer
Pour it in my ear
Just to see

If it makes it down
To relieve the frown
Of an angry bumblebee
Inside me

Buzzes 'round
And pollinates my frontal lobe
Digs my hemispheres
Into a honey comb
And calls it home

Kill
Kill the pain
Put it out
Of its misery

[Chorus]",Bumblebee
Paul Gilbert,"Look out my window one more time
Seems like another day
Watch as the mailman passes by
Bringin' some bills to pay
Suddenly appears a package
Sent here by a friend, gourmet

[Chorus]
Champagne, only for awhile now
Champagne, stop me anytime
Champagne, take me for a ride now
Champagne, used to drinking wine

Not a bad thing, thank you my friend
For relieving some pain

Look through the note that's set inside
Says to enjoy with friends
Too bad my best one said goodbye
Told me it was the end
I don't want to drink a drop now
Got nothing to celebrate

[Chorus]

Such a sad thing, please my friend
Won't you heal this pain

Where could she be
So many fish in the sea
For her unfortunately
She's not the only one

Look at my new friend dressed up tight
What am I supposed to think
I'll take her out to grab a bite
Then bring her home to drink
Some of my divine love potion
Near a number nine bouquet

Not a bad thing, thank you my friend
For relieving some pain",Champagne
Paul Gilbert,"Got a girl named Michelle
She been treatin' me so well
I don't even want to tell you about her

Got a friend named Marie
She been so good to me
I don't know if I could ever do without her

Double trouble
Gotta stop livin' this lie
I'm in serious trouble
Both girls wavin' bye bye

Took advice from a friend
If I want my pain to end
All I have to do is send her a letter

Soon my heart felt anew
So I started writin' two
To make myself feel twice as better

Paul Gilbert,"I never asked her to stay
And now she's walking away
Singing ""C'est La Vie""
Will I ever learn my lesson?

I didn't know what I had
And so I treated her bad
Now she's running free
Will I ever learn my lesson?

I don't believe what they tell me anymore
About girls who can read your mind
Who know what you're thinking all the time
Who can read your mind
If she knew what I was thinking
She would never ever leave me behind

I drank a bottle of wine
I tried to buy me some time
But something's wrong with me
And nobody wants to listen

I think of her every day
I know she's probably hangin'
Out with Donnie Vie
And they're doing more than kissin'

I don't believe what they tell me anymore
About girls who can read your mind
Who know what you're thinking all the time
Who can read your mind
If she knew what I was thinking
She would never ever leave me behind

Don't believe it, don't believe it
Don't believe it, I don't believe about

'Bout the truth here tonight
I can almost taste her
Million dollar smile

She's never had
To believe her own sadness
We should all join her

Fighting to have their picture taken
Next to a brand new imitation
Of her little ass

Died with her shattered inhibition

That it's always been

If it weren't for streetlights

Watching the tail lights
From the corner of my eye
The moon and the stars must have picked
Another part of the sky

That I haven't got a friend
Cause that's the way

Glowing ten miles away

So much farther away

Even though it's a sin to forget it

Could it be that she would prefer her we
Without me in it
I would understand if another man
Was around to win it
Did the last one leave her cold
Will the mystery unfold
Leaves me wonderin' why
No I can't even try to forget it

Yeah, I knew that it wouldn't be easy
But that don't stop me from trying
And if I said I could just forget you
I'd be lying

My persistence paid, last night she stayed
And we finally made it
The surprise I found is she's been around
And her heart is jaded

Man to raise her children
Man to share her bed
Man, what was she thinking
Will she go out of her head
If she hears this song
And she knows he's wrong

Once upon a time
Was a house in the middle of a country
English burnt it down
But for now it's standing tall
The man inside
Got his job from
Acting funny
We chose the wrong man
We chose the wrong man
We chose the wrong
Man to run the country
Man to wield the sword
Man to spend the money
More than we can all afford
When we find it's gone
And we know he's wrong

Could keep home away
We could put that dude
In solitude

Lock him away
Turn his days into night

He's the wrong man

Everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the Dancing Queen
Young and sweet only seventeen
Dancing Queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene
Dig in the Dancing Queen

You're teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another
Anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the Dancing Queen
Young and sweet only seventeen
Dancing Queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene

Paul Gilbert,"And the lamb lies down on Broadway.

Early morning Manhattan,
Ocean winds blow on the land.
The Movie-Palace is now undone,
The all-night watchmen have had their fun.
Sleeping cheaply on the midnight show,
It's the same old ending-time to go.
Get out!
It seems they cannot leave their dream.
There's something moving in the sidewalk steam,
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.

Nightime's flyers feel their pains.
Drugstore takes down the chains.
Metal motion comes in bursts,
But the gas station can quench that thirst.
Suspension cracked on unmade road
The trucker's eyes read 'Overload'
And out on the subway,
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid
Exits into daylight, spraygun hid,
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.

The lamb seems right out of place,
Yet the Broadway street scene finds a focus in its face.
Somehow it's lying there,
Brings a stillness to the air.
Though man-made light, at night is very bright,
There's no whitewash victim,
As the neons dim, to the coat of white.
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid,
Wipes his gun-he's forgotten what he did,
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.

Suzanne tired her work all done,
Thinks money-honey-be on-neon.
Cabman's velvet glove sounds the horn
And the sawdust king spits out his scorn.
Wonder women draw your blind!
Don't look at me! I'm not your kind.
I'm Rael!
Something inside me has just begun,
Lord knows what I have done,
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.
On Broadway-
They say the lights are always bright on Broadway.
They say there's always magic in the air.",The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

Paul Grabowsky,"I am not such a clever one
About the latest fads
I admit I was never one
Adored by local lads
Not that I ever try to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint
I'm old fashioned
I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands
I know I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

Don't worry

In spite and out of greed

Just for money.

In North Clark Street

They died for money, died for money.

In a love so obviously dead

Whilst she cowers away in a cupboard
And he cowers away in the she'd
Ours still takes us from behind
Like a bar-stool over the head

We could swap this helta-skelter ride
And take tranquility instead
But excitement and uncertainty
Are the girl you actually wed

For so many love is a minefield
Spent fearing where you tread
But ours just flies across the room
Like a bar-stool aimed at head

And if your down on your luck
Just duck
Chances it'll probably miss
And if it ever hits
And your head splits
It's a hell of a good night kiss

When we've grown too old for the stools
We can bring our bruised bodies together
