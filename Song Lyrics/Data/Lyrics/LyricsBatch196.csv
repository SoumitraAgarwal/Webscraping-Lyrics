Jimmy Buffett,"Every night the stars come out to light another town
Just because I'm lonely doesn't mean that gets me down
I cruise the local drive-in watching lovers holding hands
Like movie stills of Coupe de Villes and Japanese sedans 

[Chorus]
Where's the party?
Where's the party?
Everybody I know say they expect me to go to the party 

Sometimes I wish the radio would learn another song
I'd stay at home and watch TV if there was something on
But why should I get all dressed up when there's no place
To go
Still everybody looks at me as if they think I know 

[Chorus]

Everybody I see say they expect to see me at the party 

I could stay here all night long
Wait for her to call
Or I could put my walkman on
And never care at all
Still every night the stars come out to light
Another town
Just because I'm lonely doesn't mean that gets me down 

[Chorus]

Everybody I know say they expect her to show at the party",Where's the Party
Jimmy Buffett,"He took one last look 
Tossed that address book
His odyssey had begun
No time to see sights
Ran all the red lights
Burned all his bridges
Now it's love on the run 

[Chorus:]
Livin' it up 
Is takin' all of his time
But he ain't givin' it up
It suits his temperament fine 

Up on the bandstand, plays for a few fans
Workin' for minimum wage
He sees her lookin', his brain is cookin'
She takes her seat of the foot of the stage 

[Chorus:]
Livin' it up
It's takin' all of his time
But he ain't givin' it up
It suits his temperament fine 

Yeah he loves livin' it up
And takin' all of he's time
But he ain't givin' it up 
It never crosses his mind 

Didn't say much, had a soft touch
Knew what felt good in her man
He was the same way, they split the next day
Sang all the way through the Yucatan 

[Chorus:]
Livin' it up
It's takin' all of our taime
But we ain't givin' it up
It never crosses our mind
No no no he's just livin' it up
And takin' all of his time
But he ain't givin' her up
She suits his temperament fine
Yeah she's just livin' it up
And takin' all of his time.",Livin' It Up
Jimmy Buffett,"Why you want to hurt my heart
Why you want to hurt my heart
When you know that I love you
Everybody 'round us can see
Just how it ought to be
Everybody but you

Played your little game of deception
Soon there's gonna be a connection
When you're blue, oh when you're blue
I know it's just a cryin' shame, nobody left to blame
Nobody but you
If I could turn back
If I could turn back the hands of time
I'd do you a favor, straighten out confusion in your mind
In your mind

Gonna see the voodoo lady
'fore this thing drives me crazy
Learn what to do, do about you
Mix me up one of her potions, forget about my emotions
Forget about you

Why you want to hurt my heart
Why you want to hurt my heart
When you know that I love you
Everybody 'round us can see
Just how it oughta be

Jimmy Buffett,"I talk to her picture
And stare at the wall
And my friends come and offer their help
To my back they're afraid I'm losing it all
To my face they say I'm not myself
And they name all the doctors they think I should see
But they don't understand it's not me 

[Chorus]
She's going out of my mind
And I'm showing all the signs
I thought that our love was one of a kind
Now she's going out of my mind 

The place that I've kept her
Has suited her well
Though it's not where she wanted to be
And from up on that pedestal I couldn't tell
That she'd rather be down here with me
Now she just tells me how we can't relate
But she leaves out the part that I can't take 

[Chorus]

There's a tear in her eye as they drive me away
And I turn to the doctors and say",She's Going Out of My Mind
Jimmy Buffett,"They can can come take it all away
Break your heart in the light of day
Drown your love in a distant bay
So lonely
See the ship heading for the rocks 

See the time melting off the clocks
There's a light shattering all the locks
And saves me
It saves me 

That's why I wander and follow La Vie Dansante
On the night wind that takes me just where I want
That's all I want La Vie Dansante
Why don't you wander and follow La Vie Dansante
On the night wind that takes you just where you want
That's all you'll want La Vie Dansante 

Miss the beat if you close your eyes
Every night wears a new disguise
And I live when a new surprise surrenders 

Feel it all with a willing heart
Every stop is a place to start
If you know how to play the part with feeling
I play with feeling",La Vie Dansante
Jimmy Buffett,"Can't believe I'm still here
With the morning so near
And last night so unclear 

I see a trembling hand
And a cold wedding band
Wonder where do I stand? 

When the wild life betrays me
And I'm too far from home
Will you be there to save me?
Will you shelter my heart til I'm strong?
Or will you just hang up the phone? 

Will my crazy old lies
And my worn out disguise
Turn to tears in your eyes 

What a fool I have been
There's no way I can win
Unless you take me back in 

When the wild life betrays me
And I'm too far from home
Will you be there to save me?
Will you shelter my heart til I'm strong?
Or will you just hang up the phone?",When the Wild Life Betrays Me
Jimmy Buffett,"Mayan moon was burning
We saw visions
Of the past returning
On the shore
The band was playing
We all heard
What the moon was saying 

The world keeps closing in
It has before
It will again
A voice beyond the wind
Says we must go
Beyond the end
So follow
Beyond the end 

A sea of friends are singing
Vaya con dios
Mis amigos
We take their hopes and feelings
To some new world
We'll be revealing 

Old worlds keep closing in
They have before
They will again
Voices call
Beyond the wind
Say we must go
Beyond the end
And follow
Beyond the end",Beyond the End
Jimmy Buffett,"First time I ran
Was to the end of the block
I didn't know then
That it never would stop
Mow I look around
And what do I see
More and more people
Running faster then me
These days
Everybody's on the run 

When I fell in love
For the very first time
I couldn't keep up
With that girl of mine
On a mighty fast track
She ran like the wind
And she never looked back
These days
Everybody's on the run 

Now I've been to England
And I've been to France
I've learned to love oysters
And I know how to dance
Someday I'll die
And come back again
As some little boy
Just running to win
These days
Everybody's on the run 

Look in the mirror
And what do I see
The gypsy and fool that I always will be
These days
Everybody's on the run
These days
Everybody's on the run",Everybody's on the Run
Jimmy Buffett,"Look over here there's a girl
Iv'e never seen her before
Her eyes are looking straight at you
Across the crowded dance floor
Ooh she's smiling
What a beautiful sight
I got a funny feeling
She's gonna dance with you tonight 

She could be the perfect partner
She can take it in her stride
She won't try to lead or follow
The perfect partner by your side 

You've got to take a chance
You got to let somebody move you
It can happen at a dance
When there's a rhythm you can groove to
Ooh here she comes ya'll
She's coming straight to me
She's gonna ask me if I want to dance
I'll just have to wait and see 

She could be the perfect partner
She can take it in her stride
She won't try to lead or follow
The perfect partner by my side 

The worse that can happen
Is she steps on you toes
But til you take that first step with her
How will you know 

That she could be the perfect partner
She can take it in her stride
She won't try to lead or follow
The perfect partner by my side.",Perfect Partner
Jimmy Buffett,"Everyday I read about these operations
That make a heart that's weak so strong again
I relate it to my own situation
And now I know just what to say to you. 

Please bypass this heart
Until I'm well again
Let's not even start to fall where we fell again
The cheating was sweet but my heart is beat
Don't tear it apart
Please bypass this heart
Please bypass this heart 

In simpler times I didn't need a lot of healing
My heart was young and strong and worked just fine
But now you've shown me there's a hurting side of feeling
There's just one cure and here's what you must do 

Please bypass this heart.",Please Bypass This Heart
Jimmy Buffett,"Grapefruit
A bathin' suit
Chew a little Juicy Fruit
Wash away the night

Drive in
You guzzle gin
Commit a little mortal sin
It's good for the soul

And oh it gets so damn lonely
When you're on a plane alone
And if I had the money, honey
I'd strap you in beside me
And never ever leave you
Leave you at home all alone and cryin'

Ten speed
No need
My pickup gets me where I please
Chuggin' down the street

But I'll be leavin'
In a little while
So close your eyes and I'll
I'll be back real soon

""Ah, take it Reefers""
""Ladies choice, Everybody dance""

Jimmy Buffett,"He went to Paris
Looking for answers
To questions that bothered him so

He was impressive
Young and aggressive
Savin' the world on his own
But the warm summer breezes
The French wines and cheeses
Put his ambition at bay
His summers and winters
Scattered like splinters
And four to five years slipped away

Then he went to England
Played the piano
And married an actress named Kim
They had a fine life, she was a good wife
And bore him young son named Jim
And all of the answers, and all the questions
He locked in his attic one day
'Cause he liked the quiet
Clean country livin' and
Twenty more years slipped away

Well, the war took his baby
Bombs killed his lady
And left him with only one eye
His body was battered
His whole world was shattered
And all he could do was just cry
While the tears were falling and he was recalling
Answers he'd never found
So he hopped on a freighter, skidded the ocean
And left England without a sound

Now he lives in the islands
Fishes the pilings
And drinks his green label each day
Writing his memoirs
Losin' his hearin'
But he don't care what most people
Through eighty-six years of perpetual motion
If he likes you he'll smile, and he'll say,
""Jimmy, some of it's magic, some of it's tragic
But I had a good life all of the way.""

And he went to Paris
Lookin' for answers to questions
That bothered him so",He Went to Paris
Jimmy Buffett,"Creola in my soul-a
I loved what they were sayin'
I loved what they were playin'
Creola 

(CHORUS 1)
Creola on my victrola
Makes me feel like dancin'
Fall in love romancing the melody
Creola, Creola, Creola for me 

I remember as a child all the happiness and smiles
That flowed around my grandma's Sunday table
While Auntie Mae was sayin' grace
Papa T would sneak a taste
And catch a funny look from my cousin Mabel 

Then daddy'd beat the drum
The old folks start to hum
Sing the only songs that we all know
Ambiance so fine, dancin' drinkin' wine 
Sing about the lifestyle on the bayou 

(CHORUS 2)
Creola in my soul-a
I loved what they were sayin'
I loved what they were playin'
Creola 

Creola on my victrola
Makes me feel like dancin'
Fall in love romancin' the melody
Creola, Creola, Creola for me 

It's in the mood, it's in the blood
It's in the food, it's in the mud
It's a spicy kind of life
Cre-o-la 

It's in the mood, it's in the blood
It's in the food, it's in the mud
Creola, Creola, Creola for me 

(INSTRUMENTAL 2 VERSES) 

Well the years have come and gone
Still the old song lingers on
I keep it in my heart with fond affection
Like the family good luck charm
That keeps away the harm
Creola's always there for my protection

I loved what they were sayin'

Jimmy Buffett,"(for Emery Clark, who paints it better than I can say it)
They're closin' down the hangout
The air is turnin' cool
They'are shuttin' off the ""superslide""
The kids are back in school 

The tourist traps are empty
Vacancy abounds
Almost like it used to be
Before the circus came to town 

(CHORUS)
That's when it always happens
Same time every year
I come down to talk to me
When the coast is clear 

Hello mister other me
It's been a long time
We hardly get to have these chats
That in itself's a crime 

So tell me all your troubles
I'll surely tell you mine
We'll laugh and smoke and cuss and joke
And have a glass of wine 

(CHORUS)
That's where it always happens
Same place every year
I come down and talk to me
When the coast is clear

Jimmy Buffett,"(For all of those who have dared to try, made it and lived to tell about it.) 

He told it to the monkeys and they didn't talk back
Then he told the old iguana and he didn't attack 

They told me before I started
That it never ever would work out
Stay in school, don't be afool
But I had to see what life is about 

So I went to Biloxi seeking fortune and fame
I got hired, I got fired, I got called dirty names
You'll never never work in dis bidness again
No you'll never, no never
Never work in dis bidness again 

I knew I needed representation 
And I found it one night in a bar
He was a bondsman and a part time agent
And he said that he would make me a star 

He said, ""You don't have to be that good
To make it out in Hollywood
You just have to change and complain.""
Or you'll never, never work in dis bidness again
You'll never, no, never, never work in dis bidness again. 

I parked cars at the Rainbow
I sold maps of the stars
I got my nose broken in Spago's
When I puked on the bar 

All I played's a double barmitzvah
Bubba played a double bar mitzvah 

It's a jungle out there
We love it
Hell, I don't care
I'm going back to my predator friends
I will never, never work in dis bidness again
No, I'll never, no never, never work in this bidness again
You'll never, never work in this bidness again.",You'll Never Work in Dis Bidness Again

If you keep living straight from the heart

Jimmy Buffett,"Mysterious lost weekend in a land
where time stands still
Where people fall in love again
just for one more thrill

by the Caribbean sea
Someone snorkeled by raised her head up high
And my girl said who's she?

Pre you she's just another girl that I once knew
A pleasant smile a pretty face
Another time another place

and the stars that shine above
For bringing us together and 
filling us with love
So don't you fret my lady,
'cause what we have is strong
Let her swim away
out into the bay
your place is here with me

Hard to see in a sky so vast

Different islands, different worlds

What's the right way, who is to say
Tension and suspension
On a boomerang boomerang love
Boomerang boomerang love 

Big blue hole out in the ocean
Where I dive straight down until
I can not see
Feel my way through a bevy of solutions
There I realize the answer lies in me 

Gettin' off of this boomerang love
Comin' up for air
Do what's right do what's fair
Come what may, we'll find a way

No more boom boom

Jimmy Buffett,"My father always said that there's no free ride

Others haven't got a clue
Some will go and some will stay

Where the people stay in motion
Somewhere on the old gulf stream
Do they live or did I dream

with no clock
Covert rendezvous with you at the

Make the whole day one big afternoon
We'll begin with dessert a little coconut tart
Mmmm tastes as sweet as a piece of your heart
Cafe au lait beneath the Paris moon

Brazil's in the air I swear it feels like Mardi Gras time
I savor the scent love that Anik Goutal

Jimmy Buffett,"I went out fishing on a sandy beach
Cast my line out as far as it would reach
Looking for something from the frying pan
I kick back with a beer in my hand 

I must've got a big one cause it's bending my pole
I'm having to fight just to keep my hold
It could be a whale (oh) God only knows
Whatever it is it's not wearing any clothes 

She's larger than life
Made from holy water
She's covered in green
She's got little scales upon her
She's larger than life
She's a mermaid in the night 

She's got a set of gills, like no fish I've ever seen
Long blonde hair and a tail in between
I'm in love with a creature from the sea
And she's bringin' out the crustacean in me 

Her voice is a temptation it's a siren song
When we kiss there could be no wrong
I ask her to marry me, to be my wife
And we could do the backstroke for the rest of our lives 

She's larger than life
Made from holy water
She's covered in green
She's got little scales upon her
She's larger than life
She's a mermaid in the night",Mermaid in the Night
Jimmy Buffett,"I was raised by a maid who came from Martinique
She wore geckos round her neck and bracelets on her feet
A superstitious woman from the land of sugar cane
She'd sing the sun to bed and dance out in the rain
Dance out dance out dance out dance out in the rain 

She'd excite us with his legend that the
Africans had told
About a red iguana who turned lava into gold
We'd mount an expedition headin' out into the bay
Superstitious children playing pirate for a day

Red convertible sixty-five
Headed home to mississippi, he'd been
Around the world

He was singing his own song
When he yelled from the drive, my heart came alive

It's time to kiss a girl
It's time to cross the wild meridian

On the pascagoula run 

Friday night at the stateline bar
Where the waterfront people dwell
Better watch my step if the floor caves in
I'll go right straight to hell
There were pinball machines and cajun queens
Men with knives and scars
Billy moved 'cross the floor through
The real hard core
And said ""here's where it gets bizarre""

And she lives somewhere up around Cheauxvan
He's gonna circle high above her runway of love
Until she gives him her permission to land

And we live it appears

How our lives were controlled by the city 
How they keep us in debt

Got the normal ones living beyond their means 
And the things that they said

For a long time before we got fed up with all the other alternatives 
To politicians and elected our favorite bartender mayor.

And then he turned his own cold hand.

It's just a Cuban crime of passion, 
Messy and old fashioned. 
Yeah, that's what the papers did say. 
It's just a Cuban crime of passion,
Anjejo and knives a slashin'. 
Yeah but that's what the people like to read about, 
Up in America, up in America.

Well they never found Marita,
Some people say she got ill.
Billy Voltaire had no one to claim him,
He was buried on pauper's hill.
And no one talks about 'em no more,
It happned just a week ago.
But people get by and people get high,
In the tropics, they come in they go.

Jimmy Buffett,"I live on a big round ball
I never do dream I may fall
And even one day if I do
Well I'll jump up and smile back at you
I don't even know where we are
They tell me were circling a star
Well I'll take their word, I don't know
But I'm dizzy so it may be so 

I'm riding a big round ball
I never do dream I may fall
And even the high must lay low
But when I do fall I will be glad to go
Yes when I do fall I will be glad to go",Defying Gravity

Full moon in my eyes 
I wonder how in the hell I got here 
Without a disguise 
Should I take this last step 
Or turn myself around 
Or follow my intuition into that border town

Do the despreation samba con nos amigos 
Yo quiero a bailar en Mexico 
Do the desperation samba con nos amigos

From their rooms above 
Skeletons are dancing 
In the name of love 
Don't know where I'm going 
Don't like where I've been 
There may be no exit 
But hell I'm going in

Beside some hotel bed
Opened it up and looked inside

Working vacation in a third world nation
Back to school

Fly down to Miami
Get yourself a boat
Fill it full of suntan oil
And rent yourself a goat

Ain't no student loan

But you will surely learn to roll them bones

If you cut the class
They just track you through the jungle boy
Then they kick your ass

If you lose you buy the booze
And then the student body all falls down

So he took her to this movie called ""Body Heat""
She said, ""The Junior Mints were mushy and the sex was neat.

Frankie told Lola, ""Honey, can't you see that I'll jump start you if
you'll kick start me.""

They stopped at several raw bars where they slurped a dozen each
Bought a bunch of popcorn from the fat man on the dock
Baby, turn back the pages, turn round the clock. 

Lola told Frank, ""Time we put it to the test.""
After Frankie told Lola she was stil the best
They fell asleep in the sand underneath the Florida moon in June.
Lola counted rainbows, Frankie counted sheep
Til they almost got run over by the lieguards' jeep

To the bars and the beaches of my town
And there aren't many reasons I would leave

They never ask too much
And when you're coming off a cold love
That's sure a nice warm touch.

And going half mad days

I pay that man but from where I stand,
It's looking like a prisoner is me.

Is there anymore hope of scoring anymore coke,

In the middle of the second song
Dreaming I was at sea, just my baby and me
When the words started coming out wrong.

The bartender screamed last call.
When I looked to my right I saw a terrible sight
And the bass man took a bad fall.

On a Livingston Saturday night

Two heels a shuffling on the dance floor sand
Sing a song play some pong, shoot a little pool
Hitting on the honeys right out of high school

Sirens where wailing in the gulf coastal heat
And it seemed like the whole world was in forced retreat

Near civil war history my heart skipped a beat

Surrounded by stories surreal and sublime

But it's safer than most things that lovers can do

The guard by the door starts drawing the shade
So write your own ending and hope they come true

Jimmy Buffett,"Scratch my back with a lightning bolt
Thunder rolls like a bass drum note
The sound of the weather is Heaven's ragtime band

We all fell down from the Milky Way
Hangin' 'round here till the Judgment Day
Heaven only knows who is in command

Barefoot children in the rain
Got no need to explain
We'd be swingin' on a ball and chain
It's always understood by those who play the game
Barefoot children in the rain

Show me yours and I'll show you mine
Take me back to days full of monkeyshines
Bouncin' on a bubble full of trouble in the summer sun

Keep your raft from the riverboat
Fiction over fact always has my vote
And wrinkles only go where the smiles have been

Barefoot children in the rain
Got no need to explain
We'd be swingin' on a ball and chain
It's always understood by those who play the game
Barefoot children in the rain

Barefoot children in the rain

Scratch my back with a lightning bolt
Thunder rolls like a bass drum note
The sound of the weather is Heaven's ragtime band

The sky turns blue and the sun appears
But the question's still what are we doin' here
I don't think the answer's close at hand

Barefoot children in the rain
Got no need to explain
We'd be swingin' on a ball and chain
It's always understood by those who play the game
Barefoot children in the rain

In the rain

Keep her well stocked with short stories and long laughs
Go fast enough to get there, but slow enough to see

And I've crossed the oceans

From jingling his change
The idleness and grieving
For all that he retains
By the harbour lights of Sydney
Or the Bora Bora moon
He recites his sad confession
To the seagulls and the loons

Well you can claim that you were born a prince
But you're the only one you can convince
Survivor with no livelihood
That you could ever make it good
But still you dream of what you can pretend

An unexpected passenger
Boarded in Marseilles
An angel full of tenderness
She gave her heart away
She was but a gypsy
He was just a stray
They almost made a miracle but it slowly slipped away
So he follows the equator
With a wish to run aground
It's a very vicious circle
Goin' round and round and round
And he watches from the fantail
As the mainland disappears
Just like the Flying Dutchman
He's a prisoner of his fears

Find a far-off wonderland
Where you might regain command of your life today

On your corporate climb
It might come as quite a shock
But you can't really own that rock

Jimmy Buffett,"Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to run in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, fingle all the way
Oh, what fun on Jah's cool run in a one-horse open sleigh

We're dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh
And o'er the fields we go a-laughin' all the way
The bells on bob-tail ring, they're making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight

Oh, what fun it is to run in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, fingle all the way
Oh, what fun on Jah's cool run in a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago I thought I'd take a run to Port Antonio
I be cruisin' in the sun
The radio was loud, the chicken jerked and fried
And all I had to do that day was drive on the left side

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to run in a one-horse open sleigh

Jimmy Buffett,"Sail on the horizons gotta landfall rendezvous
Captain steers a well-known course, he steers straight & true
As he trims the sheets, he sings a song
He learned on boats and bars
Sailor spends his Christmas in a harbour 'neath the stars 

He's traveled through the doldrums, typhoons and hurricanes
He's logged a million soggy miles with water on his brain
But Christmas is the season better suited for dry land
He'll tell some lies, meet some spies
And dance barefoot in the sand 

(Chorus)
The sailor spends his Christmas in a harbour on the hook
Caye con les, no work today, let's shell the ol' log book
The waterfront is reveling, the season has begun
The sailor spends his Christmas in a harbour having fun. 

There's a party down at Le Selecte, music, rum and cheers
Faces in the shadows, God, I haven't seen for years
A mast & shroud fill with lights
'Neath the waning of the moon
They're an airy celebration in the realm of King Neptune. 

(Chorus) 

Jesus was a fisherman who walked upon the sea
The North Pole is ocean's remote frozen balcony
The continents keep drifting but the children sing and play
'Cause nothing really matters, after all it's Christmas day 

The sailor spends his Christmas in a harbour on the hook.
Vaye con les, no work today, he read it in a book

Jimmy Buffett,"Nothing here is different
Nothing's changed at all
And Livingston's gone to Texas
They say he had a ball

They say he learned to be cowboy
They say he learned to rope and ride
But I wonder if he ever
Thinks about the tears his woman cried

Now Holly, won't you let me
Try and make you smile?
You loved him as if he were your husband
Now he'll be gone a while

Wrote he had to see the country
On starry nights he wish that you were there
And so it shows wherever he goes
Deep inside you know he really cares 

It's crazy and it's different
But it's really being free
And reasons the world would want to question

And women came from Mars,
Then I'd be lunching with my boyfriends
While you girls talked about cigars. 

But that's not how it happened;
Evolution took a different turn.
We may be creatures with some unique features
But we've still got a lot to learn. 

We've made it nearly twenty centuries
A bunch of monkeys with PHD's.

Who seems to have his wires all crossed.

I can't e-mail you my heart.
I can't see your face in cyberspace,
I don't know where to start.
I'm light years behind from the age the call stone.
I'm a carbon based caveman honey, just flesh and bone. 

I ain't no clone, I'm just flesh and bone
Trying to connect with you.
I ain't no clone, I'm just flesh and bone
Tryin' to get the message through. 

Now we live in the age computers.
They run everything in the world.
And I'm a little behind on this technical climb
And your are an Internet girl. 

I've got words but no processor.
I've got feelings but I don't know DOS.
So I just have to go back to basics
And try to get my point across. 

Desperate for a glimpse of the future.,
We use crystals and cards and dice.
And that Y2K is coming our way.
They're talkin' 'bout some worldly strife. 

It's time to think of simpler options.
It's time to formulate a big plan be,
So if your hard drive does crash,
I got some Krugerands stashed.
Come on and sail away with me.

Jimmy Buffett,"Why does the sunset in the west?
And why does my heart keep beating in my chest?
What ever happened to the Duke of Earl?

Fell out of bed and my dog ran away.

I got stuck in a traffic jam,

Then I'd like to kill the guy who invented this
The numbers come together in some kind of a third dimension
A regular algebraic bliss.

Any two plus two will never get you five.
There are fractions in my subtraction and x don't equal why

Jimmy Buffett,"Lindbergh left Long Island in 1927
Thumbed his nose at gravity
And climbed into the heavens.
When he returned to earth that night everything changed,
For the pilot and the planet, everything was rearranged.

Of crazy human beans
It's written on our rocket ships
And in early cave wall scenes.

Who does the show?

And some refuse to dance.
Some play it safely, other take a chance.
Still it's all a mystery
This place we call the world
Where most live as oysters
While some become pearls. 

Elvis was the only man from Northeast Mississippi
Who could shake his hips and still be loved by rednecks, cops and hippies.
It's something more than DNA that tells us who we are
It's method and it's magic, we are of the stars.

Holding out a bloody sword
No matter how I squint I cannot
Make out what it's pointing toward

The days drip slowly on the page
And you catch yourself
Pacing the cage 

I've proved who I am so many times,
The magnetic strip's worn thin
And each time I was someone else
And everyone was taken in.
Powers chatter in high places
Stir up eddies in the dust of rage
Set me to pacing the cage. 

I never knew what you all wanted
So I gave you everything.
All that I could pillage
All the spells that I could sing
It's as if the thing were written
In the constitution of the age
Sooner or later you'll wind up
Pacing the cage

Sometimes the darkness is your friend.

The kind that puzzled the scribes and Pharisees.
I don't worship it like a golden calf,
But change in my pocket is always good for a laugh.

It even makes the Dali Lama smile.

It's a dang fool husband doesn't spring for his wife.

Worth it every cent.

On a reach before a following sea
We were making for the trades on the outside
And the downhill run to Papeete

Off the wind on this heading lie the Marquesas
We got eighty feet of waterline nicely making way
In a noisy bar in Avalon I tried to call you
But on the midnight watch I realized why twice you ran away

Think about how many times I have fallen
Spirits are using me, larger voices calling
What heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten
I have been around the world
Looking for that woman girl
Who knows love can endure
And you know it will. And you know it will.

When you see the southern cross for the first time
You understand just why you came this way
Cause the truth you might be running from is so small
But its as big as the promise, the promise of a coming day

And I'm heading all the way, my dreams are dying
And my love is an anchor tied to you, tied with a silver chain
I have my ship and all her flags are a-flying
She is all I have left and music is her name

And we never failed to fail, it was the easiest thing to do

Is it anger or depression
Fever or aggression

You need a holiday, take a holiday
Find a far off wonderland
Where you take command of your own life today

Take a holiday, you need a holiday

Hoist your sail and wind up on some moonlit bay

You're caught up in the Internet
You think it's such a great asset
But you're wrong, wrong, wrong

Can't replace your fears
Like an island song

Stop worrying about confession
Or making your impressions
On that corporate climb

It might come as quite a shock
But you can't really own that rock
It's just a waste of time

So take a holiday, you need a holiday
Find a far off wonderland
Where you take command of your own life this way

You need a holiday, take a holiday
Grab a pack and hit the trail
Hoist your sail and wind up on some moonlit bay

Well, it's only up to you
No one else can help you to
Go out and have some fun

And if you want to stay alive
And avoid the big nose dive
Be a comedian

So take a holiday, you need a holiday
Get yourself down off that shelf
Find a place to find yourself, quit acting so blase

Take a holiday, you need a holiday
Grab a pack and hit the trail
Wind up in the moon, it's a moonlit bay

Take a holiday, you need a holiday
Grab a pack and hit the trail
Hoist your sail and wind up on some moonlit bay

Wanted to sail upon your waters since I was three feet tall

And in your belly you hold the treasures few have ever seen
Most of 'em dream, most of 'em dream

The cannons don't thunder, there's nothin' to plunder
I'm an over-forty victim of fate
Arriving too late, arriving too late

I've done a bit of smugglin', I've run my share of grass
I made enough money to buy miami, but I pissed it away so fast
Never meant to last, never meant to last

And I have been drunk now for over two weeks
I passed out and I rallied and I sprung a few leaks
But I got stop wishin', got to go fishin'
Down to rock bottom again

Through restful waters and deep commotion

I wrest the waters, fight Neptune's waters
Sail through the sorrows of life's marauders
Unrepenting, often empty
Sail on, sail on sailor

Caught like a sewer rat alone but I sail
Bought like a crust of bread, but oh do I wail

Seldom stumble, never crumble
Try to tumble, life's a rumble
Feel the stinging I've been given
Never ending, unrelenting
Heartbreak searing, always fearing
Never caring, persevering
Sail on, sail on, sailor

I work the seaways, the gale-swept seaways
Past shipwrecked daughters of wicked waters
Uninspired, drenched and tired
Wail on, wail on, sailor

Always needing, even bleeding
Never feeding all my feelings
Damn the thunder, must I blunder
There's no wonder all I'm under
Stop the crying and the lying
And the sighing and my dying

Roll in and out like waves
I got boards to bend I got planks to nail
I got charts to make I got seas to sail

Groovy tells the waitress that his chicken died in vain
Most every day goes by according to design
I live this dream but still it seems I have you on my mind

From the bottom of my heart

After one or two false starts
I believe we found our stride
And the walls that won't come down
We can decorate or climb or find some way to get around
Cause I'm still on your side
From the bottom of my heart

I can't see the future but I know it's coming fast
It's not that hard to wind up knee deep in the past
It's come a lot of Mondays
Since the phone booth that first night
Through years and miles and tears and smiles
I want to get it right

Cause I'm still on your side
From the bottom of my heart

These days I'm up about the time I used to go to bed
Living large was once the deal, now I watch the stars instead
They are timeless and predictable unlike most things that I do
But I tell the wind and my old friend I?m headed home to you

From the bottom of my heart
Off the coast of Carolina
After one or two false starts

All the days we've been apart
Add up to a bunch of nothing
If I'm not still in your heart
I never want you to be
Just a page in my history
Someone I used to love

Your voice breathed in my ear
Or on the telephone
All the tender things we've whispered
To keep from feeling alone
May they never come to be
Just cold gems set in memory
Of someone I used to love

This current flows between us
That will not be denied
You draw me in towards you
Like the moon pulls at the tide
May no shadow ever fall
That will make me have to call
You someone I used to love

Jimmy Buffett,"If I'm over the moon, it's because I'm over you
A day at a time and I'm tickety boo
I don't carry on the way I used to
Whoop de doo, whoop de doo

If I'm doing great, it's because when I get home
I don't go straight to my answer phone
And the tears don't come the way they used to
Whoop de doo, whoop de doo

So many little things are so much better now
They were only the little things anyhow

If I'm over the moon, it's because that's what I am
Funny that once, once I used to give a damn
But I'd do anything in this whole wide world for you
Whoop de doo, whoop de doo

Anything, anything you'd want me to

All my ex's live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my ex's live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee

Rosanna's down in Texarkana
Wanted me to push her broom
Sweet Eileen's in Abilene
She forgot I hung the moon
And Allison's in Galveston
Somehow lost her sanity
And Dimple's who now lives in Temple's
Got the law looking for me

[Chorus]

I remember that old Frio River
Where I learned to swim
But it brings to mind another time
Where I wore my welcome thin
By transcendental meditation
I go there each night
But I always come back to myself
Long before daylight

All my ex's live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my ex's live in Texas

I'd like to call him somethin',

An' half the night.
Tomorrow mornin', I know there'll be hell to pay,
Hey, but that's all right.
I ain't had a day off now in over a year.

I could pay off my tab, pour myself in a cab,
An' be back to work before two.
At a moment like this, I can't help but wonder,
What would Jimmy Buffet do?

Funny you should ask that because I'd say:

Jimmy Buffett,"Hey, have you noticed that the world has changed
That the news is all bad
Well, I think it's time for a song about that

Up on the East side of Manhattan,
They're still dancing with the stars.
While over in sub prime city,
It's getting ugly in the local bars
Watching the news only gives me the blues
There's too much going wrong.
It takes the likes of me to hit the reboot key
And write a high speed drinking song.

Millionaires losing everything.
Hey, welcome to the other side of life!
There goes the yacht, there goes the Rolls,
But you, you get to keep your wife!
And don't forget the automakers
Swimming up stream like a trout.
They let the shit hit the fan
And then they made a plan
We've got a, a lot to drink about.

There's the price of oil,
The war of the spoils.
Here's your bucket for the big bailout?
Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan,
We've got a, a lot to drink about.

Now, Madoff made off with all the money.
And his clients are down to skunk weed.
Repeat after me, it's so easy to see
We're only talking simple greed.
And those Somalian pirates are counting all the gold.
While Bush and Cheney ain't around
And all the good lookers seem to be Russian hookers
From Key West to London town.

With the price of oil,
The war of the spoils.
Here's your bucket for the big bailout?
Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan,
We've got a, a lot to drink about.

So pour me some Tennessee whiskey,
Pour me a fine Jamaican rum.
That loud mouth soup
Can get ya kinda looped
Tequila, of course I'll have some!

Well the family devalues
And little children plan their net worth
And the truth wherever it's hiding,
Can be found on Google Earth.
Citibank's buying jets with our money.
I wanna flog 'em with a buggy whip.
Let's hope Obama and Joe won't let the volcano blow
And patch the hole in our sinking ship.

'Til at last we had to say goodbye,
You're leaving me to face each new tomorrow,

Jimmy C. Newman,"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.

Blamed for the loss of his wife
You know Lord I've been in a prison
For something that I've never done
It's been one hill after another
And I've climbed them all one by one

Oh but this time Lord you gave me a mountain,
A mountain you know I may never climb
It isn't just a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time

My woman got tired of the heartaches
Tired of the grief and the strife,
So tired of working for nothing
Just tired of being my wife

She took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for living
She took my small baby boy

Jimmy Calire,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear
Jimmy Calire,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

The minute you let her under your skin

For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool

One day while Kong was sleepin' on his back
A tyrannosaurus launched a sneak attack
They fought, first Kong went down then up again
The fight went on, no one knew who would win
Kong reached and seized the monster with both hands
And summoned all his strength at his command
He stretched the creature's mouth to lift (?) the split (?)
Then like a child began to play with it
He beat his hairy chest and looked around
Five miles away they heard his roaring sound

Of paradise, where roses grew

Talk with me and you'll know
I wasn't satisfied with living on the side
I started looking around for a possibility
But listen to my story, of what became of me

I met a businessman
Who said he got some friends back East
Said, ""Why don't you come along?
Well we could help you at least""
""Make you into a big star
By playing your guitar""

'Bout a year has come and gone
And left me standing here
Thinking how it could have been
'Cause still I ain't nowhere

They surely took me for a ride
Trampled on my pride
But I'll hold my head up high
Got no more tears to cry

Jimmy Cliff,"So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears
Wish you were here",Many Rivers to Cross [Harder They Come/Soundtrack Version]

Jimmy Cozier,"Just when I though that I would see again
That's when I lose my vision, you were nowhere to be found
Just when I thought that there'd be some form of communication
That's when they said the lines are down, the lines are down

So I'm writing you this heartfelt letter
And I hope that you understand
Deep inside I never meant to do you wrong
Now I know why you are gone

Just when I think it's the beginning
That when it's all over, I let time pass me by
If only I could rearrange things, I'll do it all over
I'd rewrite it line for line, line for line

So I'm writing you this heartfelt letter
And I hope that you understand
Deep inside I never meant to do you wrong, no
Now I know why you are gone

If the ink was to run out the pen
I'd use my teeth just to fill it in
I would fly through the strongest winds
To be with you, I need you, that's why I'm writing you

So I'm writing you this heartfelt letter
And I hope that you understand
Deep inside I never meant to do you wrong, no

With a woman who ain't got my back
When I give you my dough, everything you ask for

You wanna be running back on me

Other women wanna take your place
So it's real hard for me, staying there and see

When the rain comes and I ain't there

Before the break of day you be reaching out for me
And all the shit you said, you will be answering me
'cause you, you gonna see just
Just what you lost when you lose me

If you stay in love with playin' me babe

Sometimes, I think she's really crazy
She blacks out at the drop of a dime
But she's still my baby
She likes to get into confrontations with me
Testin' my patients to see
How far she can go before I loose my head

Sometimes I love her, sometimes I love her not
I ain't lettin' her go 'cause she's all I got
Although she nags me an' complains a lot
I ain't lettin' her go, no, no, no

The next minute she can be sweet as ever
Grinnin' from ear to ear, that's why were together
What could make her change so fast? It's very confusin'
Many times, I felt like up an' leavin', oh, girl
But I'm way too deep in love with her
As crazy as she is, I want her to have my kids

Sometimes I love her, sometimes I love her not
I ain't lettin' her go 'cause she's all I got
Although she nags me an' complains a lot
I ain't lettin' her go, no, no

With her, home is home
I would never turn my back

Stepped up out the club and I can't believe my eyes my

I promised her and I lied
Supposed I lost my love for a night out on the town
Left her standing in her gown
Where would my answers be when questions come around

Lost track of time hangin' with the fellas (oh!)
My jeep broke down had to change the tires (oh!)
My cell was off didn't get your message (oh!)
Or should I just tell her the truth but I can't
Cause she's so much to lose

So much to lose, so much to lose, so much to lose
3:59 I drive up to the crib thinking bout the things I did
Unspeakable if she knew she'd surely fit
Here I go again tellin' lies to my best friend
Now my love life's on a string

And said, ""Boys, I'm Big John's Cajun Queen
Now, I didn't come here to argue or waste anybody's time
I just come to get my man from your dirty old mine
'Cause he moves me

Now where you give up's where old Queenie's gonna start
'Cause I got a powerful love in my heart
So just show me the hole way down in the ground
And tell the whole wide world Big John's been found
And he's livin'""

So down in the mine without a sign of a light
Old Queenie went a-lookin' for John that night
She found him there at the bottom of the pit
And placed a red-hot kiss on his cold blue lips
He started breathin' (aah)

She waited a minute and then she kissed him again
And old John got the power of a hundred men
Up he come a-clawin' and a-diggin' like a mole
And said, ""come on Queenie, we're gonna leave this hole""
They started walkin'

Now a roar from the crowd greeted this fine pair
As they both walked out in that cool night air
And up for silence went Big John's hand
And the Queen said, ""I told you I'd get my man
'Cause he moves me""

Well he said with his voice calm and quiet
Them corn tassels need sucking I got no strength to tie it
Had no rain in so long that the fields are mighty dusty
And it's been so unbearable hot that the kids were even gettin' fussy

Now that grass down and the pasture it should be knee high
If we could just have a little shower Lord it might keep the calf from going dry
Oh but listen to me talking you'd think I wasn't grateful
Why if you didn't know me so well Lord you'd think I was down right hateful

You'd think I forgot about that new calf that you sent
And the money in the mail that took care of the rent
Mama's cough's better and Johnny's home from the navy
And that good Sunday dinner of hot chicken and dumplings and gravy

And that new preacher you sent us Lord he's sure a fine young man
Why he's just convertin' them sinners to beat the man
Well I guess I'll mosey on home now Lord I won't take no more your time

Jimmy Dean,"Many people look through their wallet or their pocket books and, way down at the bottom, past the credit cards and baby pictures and so on, you usually find a little 'ol piece of dog-eared poetry. I was cleaning out my wallet the other day and ran across a whole bunch of I.O.U's, some of 'em thirty-five years overdue. And you know the funny thing, all these I.O.U's are owed to one person and I kinda felt like that maybe now would be a pretty good time for an accountin'.

Mom, I sure hope you're listenin'.
Sweet lady, I.O.U. for so many things...
A lot of services, like night watchman for instance...
Lyin' awake nights, listenin' for coughs and cries and creakin' floorboards
Ha ha, and me comin' in too late.
Boy, you had the eye of an eagle and the roar of a lion,
But you always had a heart as big as a house.
I.O.U. for services like, uh, short order cook, chef, baker...
For makin' sirloin out o' hamburger an' turkey out o' tuna fish,
And big ol' strappin' boys out of leftovers.
I.O.U. for cleanin' services,
The daily scrubbing of face and ears...all work done by hand.
And for the frequent dustin' of a small boy's pants
To try to make sure that you led a spotless life.
And for washin' and ironin' that no laundry could ever do.
For dryin' the tears of childhood 
And ironin' out the problems of growin' up.
I.O.U. for services as a bodyguard, 
For protectin' me from the terrors of thunderstorms and nightmares
Ha, and too many green apples.
And Lord knows, I.O.U. for medical attention,
For nursing me through measles, mumps, bruises,
Bumps, splinters and spring fever.
Oh-oh, let's not forget medical advice...important things like, 
""If you keep on scratching that, it'll never get well."" or
""If you cross your eyes, they're gonna stick like that."".
And probably the most important advice of all,
""Boy, you be sure you got on clean underwear, in case you're in an accident.""
And I.O.U. for veterinarian services,
For feeding every lost dog that I dragged home at the end of the rope,
And for healing the pains of puppy love.
And I.O.U. for entertainment...
Entertainment that kept the household goin' through some pretty rough times...
And for wonderful productions at Christmas, the Fourth of July, birthdays...
And for making make-believe come true...
And you did it all on such a limited budget.
I.O.U. for construction work, for building kites and confidence, hopes and dreams and...
Somehow you made them all touch the sky...
And for cementin' together a family 
So it would stand the worst kind of shocks and blows...
And for layin' down a good strong foundation to build a life on.
I.O.U. for carrier charges...
For carryin' me on your books for the necessities of life
That a growin' boy somehow, well, they just gotta have.
Things like, ha ha, a pair of high top boots,
With a little pocket on the side for a jackknife.
And one thing, Mom, I'll never forget...
When there were two pieces of pie and three hungry people...
You were always the one who decided, well, I'm not really that hungry anyhow.
These are just a few of the things for which payment is long overdue...
The person that I owe 'em to worked very, very cheap...
She managed by simply doin' without a whole lot o' things that she needed herself...
My I.O.U's add up to more than I could ever hope to repay,
But you know the nicest thing about it all...
That I know, that she had marked the entire bill 'Paid In Full'
For just one kiss and four little words...Mom, I love you!",I.O.U.

But like the wind it covers our land

It can lift you up, it can let you down
Take your world, turn it all around

Found that's stronger than love

Trouble their mind day in and day out

Her young close to her breast,then I thank God

Jimmy Dean,"(God put a song in the heart of an angel and softly she sang it to me)
I get to thinkin' lotta times about when I was a lad 
Of the old home place where I grew up of the days both good and bad 
My overalls were hand-me-downs shoes full of holes 
I used to walk four miles to school every day through the rain the sleet and the cold
I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry 
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm and seven hungry mouths to feed
And yet and somehow our homefire never flickered once
Cause when all the things went wrong
Mama took the hymn book down and mama sang a song
(What a friend we have in Jesus)
I've been rocked to sleep many a night to the tune of What a Friend
Morning come Rock of Ages it gently wake me once again
Then daddy'd reach up and take the Bible down and he'd read it
Read it loud and strong
And I always felt that maybe our home was blessed
When daddy'd say mama sing a song
Sister left home first I guess then Bob and Tommy and Dan
By then dad's hair was turning grey and I had to be mama's little man
But it seemed that when dad grew weak mom's faith grew strong
And I think those were the greatest days of all when mama sang a song
(Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee)
I guess the old house is still standin' I don't go back much anymore
No voice is left to fill those halls no steps to grace the floor
For you see mama sings in heaven now round God's golden throne
But I'll always believe that this old world is a whole lot better place
Because one time my mama sang a song (precious mem'ries flood my soul)",Mama Sang a Song

And the auctioneer felt it was hardly worth his while,
To waste much time on the old violin but he held it up with a smile,
Well it sure ain't much but its all we got left I guess we aught to sell it to,
Oh, now who'll start the bid on this old violin?
Just one more and we'll be through.

And then he cried one give me one dollar,
Who'll make it two only two dollars who'll make it three,
Three dollars twice now that's a good price,
Now who's gonna bid for me?

Well the air was hot and the people stood around as the sun was setting low,
From the back of the crowd a gray haired man,
Came forward and picked up the bow,
He wiped the dust from the old violin then he tightened up the strings,
Then he played out a melody pure and sweet, sweeter than the Angels sing, 
And then the music stopped and the auctioneer, 
With a voice that was quiet and low he said now what am I bid,
For this old violin and he held it up with a bow.

And then he cried out one give me one thousand,

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday

I could write a preface on how we met
So the world would never forget, never, never forget

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you, allot
Then the world discovers as my book ends

Jimmy Deuchar,"Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me

Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last

Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Jimmy Donley,"Oh what a price I had to pay
For loving you, you, you

I bought a house, a diamond ring
I had to give up everything
Oh what a price I had to pay
For loving you, you, you

I  stopped my rambling, I even stopped gambling
And I stopped staying out all night
Oh what a price I had to pay
For loving you, you, you

I tried so hard to do what's right
But you only wrecked my life
Oh what a price I had to pay

So, goodbye baby, I'm gone

Jimmy Dorsey,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush

In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear the third man theme

To the Mississippi
We'll take a boat to the land of dreams

Where all the proud and elite folks meet
Heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street

Someday again we'll meet.

I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light

A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear

And I'm on my way.

I'm stepping out with a memory tonight,
To paint the town the way we used to do.
I'll dine at the old cafe where we had so much fun,
And order cocktails for two instead of the usual one.

Then, after dark,
In a Hansom through the park,
While reminiscin' I'll be kissin' you.

If ever we were through.

If I could speak my mind

Whenever we're apart.

Refuse to leave my heart.

I've said them all to you.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,

I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

They still say 'I love you,'
On that you can rely,
No matter what the future brings,

Never out of date,
Hearts full of passion,
Jealousy and hate,
Woman needs man, and man must have his mate,

I played me a waiting game.
If a maid refused me with tossing curls,
I let the earth take a couple of whirls.
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls.
And as time came around, she came my way,
And as time came around, she came.

Oh it's a long, long while, from May to December
But the days grow short, when you reach September.
When the autumn weather, turns the leaves to flame,
One hasn't got time, for the waiting game.

Oh, the days dwindle down, to a precious few.

And these few precious days, I'll spend with you.

A day in the country, a night on the town,

Or else the evening you parted, the morning you met,
The love of your life you can never forget.
The reason is simple. 
The memory belongs
To one of those wonderful songs!

Because it's one of those songs that's so easy to hear.
You listen just once then you play it by ear.

Jimmy Eat World,"What's wrong baby?
Don't they treat you like they should?
Did you take them for it?
Or every penny that you could?

We once walked out on the beach
And once I almost touched your hand
Oh, how I dreamed to finally say such things
Then only to pretend

Don't you know I'm thinking? (know I'm thinking)
Driving 405 past midnight
Don't you know I miss you? (don't you know I miss you?)
Ninth and ash on a Tuesday night

I would write to you from Museum Mile
A toast to you
Your whisper
Your smile

Up the stairs at the Weatherford
A ghost each place I hide

If you don't know
Why would ya say so?
Would you mean this please if this happens?
If you don't know
Why would ya say so?
Won't you get your story straight?
If you don't know, honey
Why'd you just say so?
'cause I need this now
More than I ever did
If you don't know, honey
Then you don't

I left you waiting (I left you waiting)
At the least could we be friends?
Should have never started (never started)
Ain't that the way it always ends?

On my life I'll try today
There's so much I've felt I should say but
Even if your heart would listen
I doubt I could explain

Why would ya say so?
Would you mean this please if this happens?
If you don't know

If you don't, well honey
Then you don't

(Do, do, do)

So here we are now
A sip of wine
A sip of water

Someday maybe
Maybe someday
We'll be smarter

And I'm sorry that I'm such a mess
I drank all my money could get
Took everything you let me have
And never loved you back

Why would ya say so?
Would you mean this please if this happens?

Things are never going to be quite what you want
Even at twenty five you got to start sometime

I wanna always feel like part of this was mine
I wanna fall in love tonight

What are you gonna have to say for yourself?

It was my turn to decide
I knew this was our time
No one else will have me like you do
No one else will have me, only you

You'll sit alone forever
If you wait for the right time
What are you hoping for?
I'm here and now I'm ready
Holding on tight
Don't give away the end
The one thing that stays mine

Ill be 23
I won't always love what Ill never have
I won't always live in my regrets

You're the one that I need
You make the hardest things

Keep my heart

You promise, you promise, that you're done
But I can't tell you from the drugs

Don't let go
We'll dig a great big hole
Down an endless hole
We'll both go
You're so blind
You can't save me this time
Hope comes from inside
And I feel so low tonight

If only you could see

You promise, you promise, that you're done
But I can't tell you from the drugs

In books I never read
When the girls come talk to me
I wish to hell I had

Get up, Get up
Turn the ignition
Get up, Get up
Fire up the system
Play my little part in something big

I'll accept with poise with grace
When they draw my name from the lottery
And they'll say ""all the salt in the world couldnt melt that ice""

I'm a New Jersey success story
And they'll say ""Lord give me the chance to shake that hand""

I was someone you'd have liked
Got an old guitar I had for years I'd let you buy
And I'll tell you something else
That you ain't dying enough to know
Theres still some living left when your prime comes and goes

Get up, Get up
Dance on the ceiling
Get up, Get up
Boy you must be dreaming
Rock on young savior
Don't give up your hopes

I'll accept with poise with grace
When they draw my name from the lottery
And they'll say ""all the salt in the world couldn't melt that ice""

Jimmy Forrest,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night

She gave your very first kiss to you

Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning

Jimmy Forrest,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

When I feel the wind blow across my face

I believe in a place called Calvary
I believe in a man his name is Jesus
And I believe that he gave his life for me

I held her hand as she closed her eyes to sleep
I felt the power of ten thousand angels

Where's the day I'll have started forgetting
But I just go on thinking and sweating

And cursing and crying
And turning and reaching
And waking and dying
And no, not a day goes by
Not a blessed day
But you're still somehow part of my life
And you won't go away
So there's hell to pay
And until I die
I'll die day after day after day
After day
After day after day after day

And day by day my love seems to grow
There isn't any end to my devotion
It's deeper dear by far than any ocean

Jimmy Gourley,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

Jimmy Gourley,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low

Nothing but love in view, then you fall

I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance. 
I'll try to apply myself and teach my heart to sing. 
I'll go my way by myself like a bird on the wing,
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.
I'll go my way by myself, here's how the comedy ends. 
I'll have to deny myself love and laughter and friends.

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

I know now that you're not a plaything
Not a toy, or a puppet on a string

how my heart just fell to my feet

But as his fame grew she was pushed aside,
So the mountain girl would say good-bye,

He let his hair grow long and he dressed in style,

His voice was pure and the fans went wild,
For the folk singer,
He said Sara Jane was much too plain,
So he left her alone as grew more fame,
But sorrow will come like a mountain rain,

He could not sing now his friends were few,

After tossing and turning
And yearning the whole night long

Pretty baby
Since you went away
Haven't spent a happy day

I wake up crying
After sobbing and sighing
And wondering just what went wrong

Pretty baby
I was good to you
Why'd you go and make me blue

I need your arms
To hold me tight
I need your lips
To kiss me goodnight

I'm so unhappy on my own
Don't, don't leave me
Sad and lonely

And yearning the whole night long

Before the crack of dawn,
Sittin' here thinkin'
Oh why was I born?
So broken hearted,
How can I go on?
Since you've been gone, since you've been gone.

I was so happy
With you by my side,
You told me you loved me,
But honey you lied.
You left me here cryin',
How can I go on?
Since you've been gone, since you've been gone.

The night seems like a million years, mmhm,
Waitin' 'til the break of day appears, oh oh oh.
All night long weepin' like a willow,
Tossin' and turnin' on my tear stained pillow,
Guess I'm gonna drown in my own tears.

I'm gonna let the choo-choo cross over my back.

A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun

But soft and sweet and dreaming

With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control

Ride to the rythme of the nickel put the pen in the pack now
And I know you fear me, I done been there
Done that, run that, fun that covered around
And let me kill 'em with the venom we killin 'em with the sound
Every city, every little bitty town
Everybody want to break me down

You really fucked up, poppa you was a roller
But his pockets are all swollen, you met the dope man
And now we on the block ask who told 'em

The smell of the prairie after it rains

Bob Dylan records, the carnival crowd
Beautiful ladies, forgiveness of sin

Abandoned bus stations, AM radio
Beat generation, highways that bend
The feeling I get when I see you again

I went rolling through the fields of grain

I thought about you, can't live without you
No matter how I try
There's something sacred
The way the tears fall from your eyes

I went flying, in a big jet plane
Across the ocean, just to know your name

Island princess, it's my heart's concern
I should've never said goodbye
There's something sacred
When the tears fall from your eyes

Let 'em fall, let 'em fall on me
Let 'em fall, let 'em set me free

I went dreaming and I saw your face
And in that moment, I was touched by grace

And all alone now, I hear the wolves howl
And it makes me wonder why

When sundown pales the sky
I wanna hide a while behind your smile
And everywhere I'd look, your eyes I'd find

For me to love you now would be the sweetest thing
It would make me sing
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind

Diddy, da da, la da da, da da da
Ya da da, da da, la da

When rain has hung the leaves with tears
I want you near to kill my fears
To help me to leave all my blues behind

For standing in your heart
Is where I wanna be and I long to be
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind

Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind

",Catch the Wind
Jimmy LaRocca,"Oh, Baby can you see in your eyes 
Across an advance wind yeah 
What imagine at the sky? 
What do you do you want? do you need? 

Oh Baby when we're sad, we're bad 
I phoned to you midnight call yeah 
But I know it's never change 
Yes, every loneliness is never die 

Never say ever say never ever say
Whenever time has gone 
We found the many things 
Every night every night never ever say
The heart is never end, never ever never end 

Listen to my heart, Looking for your dream 
Happy shining place, oh that you want 
Baby are you free? baby are you sad? 
Do you want to have me living with you? 

Listen to my heart, Looking for your dream 
Now we stand amid contrary wind 
I believe you now 
You can work it out 
Dreams come true 

Oh, Baby it's just the same after all 
It's no use crying over split milk
This word is a commonplace 
But now I say to say to you 

Oh Baby no I can't say fall in love
Because it is heavy heart for me 
But I want to gaze at you 
Please gaze at me tonight forever more 

Never say ever say never ever say
If we'll part if you'll say good-bye to me 
Every night every night never ever say
I'll never forget you never forget your eyes 

Listen to my heart, Looking for your dream 
Maybe it's a long and winding road 
Can I come across? can I'm satisfied? 
Can I have a kindly look and heart? 

Listen to my heart, looking for your dream 
There is a place where we can go 
Wind is blowing so gentle like your smile 
Dreams come true

Jimmy Levine,"All is fair in love 
Love's a crazy game 
Two people vow to stay 
In love as one they say 

But all is changed with time 
The future no one can see 
The road you leave behind 
Ahead lies mystery 

But all is fair in love 
I had to go away 
A writer takes his pen 
To write the words again 
That all in love is fair 

All of fate's a chance 
It's either good or bad 
I tossed my coin to say 
In love with me you'd stay 

But all in war is so cold 
You either win or lose 
When all is put away 
The losing side I'll play 

But all is fair in love 
I should never have left your side 
A writer takes his pen 
To write the words again 
That all in love is fair 
A writer takes his pen 
To write the words again 
That all in love is fair",All in Love Is Fair
Jimmy Levine,"First I was thinking that you're okay
Then I was thinking you're far away
Thought how I might like to get to know you better
I just got to, got to get to know you
Much, much better

[Chorus]
I want you
I want you
I want you
Baby I want you

Made up my mind and I made my plan
I'm on to you like a hardcore fan
I got trackers and lookouts, electronic scanners
Got you on my mind and it's mind over manners

[Chorus]

I got the inside news
I got the latest point of view
I'm looking to pursue
Any stories that I hear of you

Packing my bag and I'm playing my hand
He looks to me like the promised man
Got no time for poses set my explosives
I'm gunning for you I got power packed motives

[Chorus]",I Want You
Jimmy Levine,"I'm not quite sure what I want you to do
So why don't you just stand there
And look at me like I'm fucking insane
I'm your Einstein on acid
Your superman, if you will
If you would, I think you could do a lot worse than me

My t's are dotted and my eyes are crossed
Somewhat funny, somewhat bitter, somewhat lost
I make more sense than your steady one hand clapping
Thinking daisies but I'm pushing up little black roses

Dropped off my common sense
On four mile road
Bad to the marrow
And sour to the bone
Salty like an ocean
I know you want to swim
I think you're wonderful
You're wonderful, you're wonderful

Feeling rather silly, talking's such a chore
I know you want out, I know, I'm such a whore
But I can make you giggle
And do that funny little thing you do
Sleeping with the dogs was never this good

You're not so sure about me
I can tell
But you know me better than anyone
And I'm just lame
You're so great, you know
A total shooting star
I think you're wonderful
You're wonderful, you're wonderful",Wonderful

Jimmy Little,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.

They'd dance all night till the break of day 
When the caller hollered ""do-se-do""
You knew Uncle Pen was ready to go 

Late in the evening about sundown 
High on the hill and above the town
Uncle Pen played the fiddle lord how it would ring
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing

He played an old piece he called ""Soldier's Joy""
And the one called ""The Boston Boy""
The greatest of all was ""Jenny Lynn""
To me that's where the fiddle begins

Look up toward the heavens each night
When the stars seem to shine

Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind
In a moment of glory
A face comes before me

Jimmy Martin,"Some people drink champagne out under the stars
While others drink wine leaning over a bar
But all that I need dear to make me feel fine
Is to know that your love will forever be mine

I'd give an ocean of diamonds or a world filled with flowers
To hold you closely for just a few hours
Hear you whisper softly that you love me too
Would change all the dark clouds to bluest of blue

I don't drink their champagne and I don't drink their wine
So, if you refuse me, my poor heart will pine
I'll be so lonely till the day that I die
And as long as I live dear, you'll still hear me cry

Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things

Jimmy McGriff,"I can only give you love that lasts forever,
And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more, that's all, that's all.",That's All
Jimmy McGriff,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

Jimmy McPartland,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

Jimmy Nail,"blue roses will blossom in the snow
before I ever let you go
blue roses will grow up to the sky
before I ever make you cry
blue roses...
you need more reassurance
than a frightened orphan child
that I'm always gonna want you
that I'll always be beguiled
so I search for words to tell you
that my love for you is blind
but this fragment of a children's song
is all that I can find
blue roses will blossom in the snow
before I ever let you go
blue roses will grow up to the sky
before I ever make you cry
blue roses...
this nursery rhyme is corny,
it is stranded out of time
yet it's simple and it's honest
the same and since when was that a crime ?
and perhaps whoever wrote it
loved someone like I love you
for in matters of the heart I've learned
there's little that is new
blue roses will blossom In the snow
before I ever let you go
blue roses will grow up to the sky
before I ever make you cry
blue roses...

you were an angel in torment
how could I desert you I vowed in that moment

demons wage unholy war
but I'm on my way to save you

now look around it's hard to see integrity
you ask for direction and they don't know

but once upon a time was a long time ago
once upon a time we built a revolution
big steel wheel roll around the world
ten ships sailed and whaled and delivered
all the food necessary for the boys and girls
then one day came a man with a mission
to take away everything they know
once upon a time was a land for heroes
but once upon a time was a long time ago
once upon a time things were oh so simple
you did a day's work you got a day's pay
it didn't come to much but it kept a wife and children
burned in the lantern thatâ€™ld light the way

Jimmy Needham,"I said you gotta leave, you gotta promise me
It's the beginning of my end, you gotta promise me
How can a Holy God renew a wicked Pharisee 
I'm saying, I'm like Peter in the boat so just depart from me
It seems I'm destined for doom like ancient prophesy 
And in the dark I'm consumed it's just to much for me
With sin in full bloom my gloom booms by the full moon
And I'm thinking to myself how can you rescue me?

I can't but sing
My before and after
I'll sing praises to my King

Here's the anthem let it ring
One love two arms three scars 
Draw us to where you are
No one is too far for you to save a heart

Then in the darkness of this room you snuck up next to me
You put your hand upon my wound and whispered rest in me
And there I stepped out of the tomb and into destiny 
The rest they say is history 
Your grace is such a mystery

[Chorus]

I got a name change
And that's the strange thing
Cause I was once stained
But now I'm called saint

Behind the orphan’s stare
Every time I breathe the air

To the star-filled sky

There’s nowhere I go Your glory isn’t revealed
I just look up and see it

Everywhere I go I see arrows
Pointing the way back to You
Everything I see grabs ahold of me
Leading me straight back to You

Maybe Plato’s right
There is more than meets the eye
What I witness with my eyes
Tells a bigger story
Like the serpent on the staff
Like the ark that Noah had
You’re painting pictures that, oh
Echo Your glory
When Moses struck the rock the secret was spilled
‘Cause the spring is Jesus

Pull back and let go
And send me wherever You want me to go

And if love were time, I would spend all mine
Just livin’ inside her world

They warned that you’d demand all my attention
Not to mention you’re my very first child
It’s true I’m spending nearly half an hour
Making faces just to get you to smile
You’ve got me doing these silly little dance moves
I hope this don’t make it onto YouTube

Soon she’ll crawl, then walk, then talk, she’s here for a while
Then sweet sixteen, and like a dream, she’s down the aisle

A lifetime of empty days

Wanted to give her everything

Jimmy Needham,"I remember it was later in December when we got the call
Dead of winter cut deep like a splinter from the weight of it all
When the news came, for me the hardest part of all
Was to see you sitting there so brokenhearted

I'd forgotten how it felt to hit the bottom when
You suffer pain
It was like tryin' to run a hundred miles in the pourin' rain
But the truth is not even storms can kill this flame
My promise to you always remains

In the middle of the cold, dark night
In the middle it'll be all right
I will be there, I will be there
And if pain is the ocean you are swimmin' in
If I can't pull you out, I'm divin' in

Never thought I could love anyone the way that I loved you
And if it took my life I'd fight to protect you, too
But I was helpless and there was nothing I could do
So I'll just wrap my arms around you and say

In the middle of the cold, dark night
In the middle it'll be all right
I will be there, I will be there
And if pain is the ocean you are swimmin' in
If I can't pull you out, I'm divin' in

I believe that God was there
Watching over us
I believe He heard our prayers
He cried along with us
Even when our hearts are scared
He's closer than He seems
And I can hear Him sing

In the middle of the cold, dark night
In the middle it'll be all right
I will be there, I will be there
And if pain is the ocean you are swimmin' in
You can rest assured that I'll be divin' in

In the middle of the cold, dark night

I'm never gonna get out of this prison baby, 
The only way I get out is climb over the wall,

And climb over the wall 
Well I can't climb the ladder baby,

Down in the valley below

The beads of time pass slow
Tired eyes on the sunrise

The woe of aftermath
The drums will shake the castle wall
The ring wraiths ride in black

Sing as you raise your bow

That lights the face so cold

Whose golden tongue she will believe

Take my hand and stop the clock
From turning over
Spirit weave and spirit bend
In the move that has no end
That we must follow

Show me your eyes
Oh light of the sun
Touch me with fire
My mind is undone
All life inspire
My freedom has come
I drift through desire

When you do what you do
I can never, never, never
Let you go
When you feel the way you feel
You can never, never, never

I remember when my world, came falling down
Out there the stars stop dancing
Lost in my darkness now, the rain keeps falling down

Light of my life, where have you gone
Love's true flame dies, without the warmth of your sun

Here comes the blue train rollin'
Across my heart it crawls, the rain still pouring down
Another day escapes me
A little later maybe, love will roll around

Light of my life, where have you gone
Love's true flame dies, without the warmth of your sun

I've been waiting on a corner
Yeah, I've been waiting for a sign now
Oh, I've been waiting on the corner
I've been waiting for a sign now, oh, now

Whistle blowin', blue train rollin', carry my darling son, hey, hey
Whistle blowin', blue train rollin', carry my heart
