Eddie Rabbitt,"I haven't much to offer
But my future looks bright
I do what I do well
I'll always get by

And I don't even have the right to ask you
But I've been loving you so long

Could you love a poor boy?
Could you, Dolly?
Could you love a poor boy?
If you come live with me
Dolly, I'd be so proud

Could you love a poor boy?
Could you, Dolly?
Could you love a poor boy?
If I gave you this ring
Would you wear it on your finger at night?

I haven't got a mansion
But I got a piece of lane
And I'll build a home for you
With these hard-working hands

And I'd love you like there was no tomorrow
Every day of my life

Could you love a poor boy?
Could you, Dolly?
Could you love a poor boy? (Poor boy)
If you come live with me
Dolly, I'd be so proud

Could you love a poor boy?
Could you, Dolly?
Could you love a poor boy? (Poor boy)
If I gave you this ring
Would you wear it on your finger at night?

Could you love a poor boy?
Could you, Dolly?
Could you love a poor boy? (Poor boy)
If you come live with me
Dolly, I'd be so proud

Could you love a poor boy?
Could you, Dolly?
Could you love a poor boy? (Poor boy)
If I gave you this ring
Would you wear it on your finger at night?","Could You Love a Poor Boy, Dolly"
Eddie Rabbitt,"Maybe it's a man's world, but girls make it go 'round
But I wouldn't give a nickel for my peace of ground if it
Weren't for my lady standing on it, sweet and proud
Come on, lady, love me now

'Cause I'm gonna do you right tonight
Turn on your light tonight
I'll be right back to ease your mind
Honey, I'm gonna take my time
I'm gonna do you right tonight

Oh, hazel-eyed lady, you got the softest hands
You make me feel like I've got more than any man, and if you
Give me the time, honey, I'll love you more
Than anyone who came before

Then I'm gonna do you right tonight
Turn on your light tonight
I'll be right back to ease your mind
Honey, I'm gonna take my time
I'm gonna do you right tonight

Do you, do you right tonight
Do you, do you right tonight

Eddie Rabbitt,"I just came in here for a quick one
And you're a lovely lady, there's no denying that
And your invitation sounds inviting
There's only one little thing that's holding me back

I can't get this ring off my finger
And I just couldn't with it looking back at me
'Cause that's true love wrapped around my finger
So I better just drink up and leave

Sure, I think you're a doll, lonely waiting
And I'm sure that loving you would be sweet
And thanks for the compliment you're under
But this little band's become a part of me

And I can't get this ring off my finger
And I just couldn't with it looking back at me
'Cause that's true love wrapped around my finger
So I better just drink up and leave
Yes, I better just drink up and leave",I Can't Get This Ring off My Finger
Eddie Rabbitt,"I don't wanna make love
With anyone else but you
'Cause it would never be as good
With anyone else but you
Oh, no

Now, I've been around enough to know
When you find true love, don't let it go
And I don't wanna make, I don't wanna make love
With anyone else but you

So turn your lamp light low
And let me show you what I mean
Let's go back to that magic place
That only you and I have seen

I don't wanna make love
With anyone else but you
'Cause it would never be love
With anyone else but you
Oh, no

But lonely nights I knew before
I left them all outside your door
And I don't wanna make, I don't wanna make love
With anyone else, with anyone else
But you",I Don't Wanna Make Love (With Anyone But You)
Eddie Rabbitt,"Blood rushing up into my brain
I'm weak and uneasy and I'm feeling strange
Baby (Baby)

Quivering legs and trembling hands
I don't believe even Superman
Can save me (Save me)

Throw your lifeline out to me
I'm a drowning man on a raging sea

And I just got to have you
There's no other way
I just got to have you
Not tomorrow, today

The moment that I first set eyes on you
Well, I made up my mind
My love, it ain't blind, baby
I just got to have you

Well, every man's got his fantasy
But you're beyond my wildest dreams
Baby (Baby)

And I'd give everything I own
Just to get you off alone
Baby (Baby)

Turn your green light on for me
I'm a speeding man on a dead-end street

And I just got to have you (Just got to have you)
There's no other way (Just got to have you)

Eddie Rabbitt,"She turns on the light
And pulls back the covers
Tiptoes to her things on the chair

She slips on her dress
And leans down to kiss me
Walks out the door
Brushing her hair

And I don't know when I'll hold her again
Maybe never
'Cause she's just not free to stay here with me
And be my forever

'Cause there's someone she lies to
To lay here with me

The sheets are still warm
Where she laid beside me
Stealing the moments while we can

Now, here comes the sun
Well, I hope that she made it
Seems it was over before it began

And I don't know when I'll hold her again
Maybe never
But she's just not free to stay here with me
And be my forever

'Cause there's someone she lies to
To lay here with me
There's someone she lies to
To lay here with me",There's Someone She Lies To (To Lay Here with Me)
Eddie Rabbitt,"Takes a wad of dough and he plops it on the table
Makes it flat and round and pours in a ladle of tomato sauce
Spreads it, red, thick, and sweet

Takes a big fistful of mozzarella cheese
Spreads it around with anchovies
Green peppers and onions and mushrooms and little ground beef

Then he puts it on the shelf, and then shoves it in the oven
With tender lovin' care
And he dances around while our tongues hang out
And the smell of heaven fills the air

Tullahoma dancing pizza man
Make me the juiciest pizza in the land
Hey, I'm no penny pincher
Give me that big sixteen-incher
Whoa-oh, make it to go

Tullahoma dancing pizza man

Well, we sat in the booth less than a quarter of an hour
And out of the oven, like a giant sunflower
Who came all ready and steamin' with boilin' cheese

Well, he took his round knife and he cut it up in slices
Put it in a box, looked at me and said the price is
$3.99, I gave him a five, I got $1.01 change

And I was tempted to eat it on the front seat
It smelled so good I could hardly drive
So now, excuse me, please, but I gotta have a piece
Of that scrumptious pizza pie

I got a good-payin' job in Little Rock, Arkansas
I am a hard-workin' guy, patriotic, and I don't break the law

Why do I need you, girl?
You only make me blue

My head keeps spinnin' 'round
The good times that we knew
I'm a fool
And I'm hurtin' for you

Well, it's worth what I go through

He's here! He's here!"") 

I hear him, before I go to sleep 
And focus on the day that's been. 
I realize he's there, 
When I turn the light off and turn over. 

Nobody knows about my man. 
They think he's lost on some horizon. 
And suddenly I find myself 
Listening to a man I've never known before, 

Telling me about the sea, 
All his love, 'til eternity. 

Ooh, he's here again, 
The man with the child in his eyes. 
Ooh, he's here again, 
The man with the child in his eyes. 

He's very understanding, 
And he's so aware of all my situations. 
And when I stay up late, 
He's always waiting, but I feel him hesitate. 

Oh, I'm so worried about my love. 
They say, ""No, no, it won't last forever."" 
And here I am again, my girl, 
Wondering what on Earth I'm doing here. 
Maybe he doesn't love me. 
I just took a trip on my love for him. 

Ooh, he's here again, 
The man with the child in his eyes.
Ooh, he's here again, 
The man with the child in his eyes

Eddie Rabbitt,"Well I know a place where love comes easy
And I know a woman who meets me there
She takes my hand, and gently leads me
And we go up to the room at the top of the stairs.

I close the door and she pulls the curtain
When we make love, it's a private affair.
I've been around and I know for certain
There ain't no room like the room at the top of the stairs.

When we climb up the stairway to heaven
We find love waiting there.
Right at home, oh just me and my baby.
The lovin's good in the room at the top of the stairs.

Eddie Rabbitt,"I remember daddy playing on the violin,
jigs and reels that he brought from Ireland.
And I'm the first born in America, my friend.

I have never been there but someday I'll take a trip.
I'll cross the ocean on a big long silver ship.
Hear them sing those songs I learned from Mama's knee

I just close my eyes and I can almost see,
those shamrock hills and those forty shades of green.
And the roots that tie me to a land I've never known
are calling me home, are calling me home.

Sun shines through my window here in Tennessee.
God sure made this a pretty place to be.
But sometimes it just don't feel like home to me.

So I close my eyes and I can almost see
those shamrock hills and those forty shades of green.
And the roots that tie me to a land I've never known
are calling me home.
Are calling me home.
Are calling me home.",Song of Ireland

I'm so glad that I met you, baby.
And I'm so proud when we walk down the street.
And I know it's crazy to worry like I do.
But I get this feelin' that I'm losing you.
 
I get these suspicions even though 
I know that you love me, baby,
and I really shouldn't feel this way.
Suspicions, I can't help it you're just so good lookin'
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me.

You always turn every head in the room.

Eddie Rabbitt,"I went out walking through the streets paved with gold
Lifted some stones
Saw the skin and bones
Of a city without a soul
I went out walking under an atomic sky
Where the ground wont turn
And the rain it burns
Like the tears when I said goodbye

Yeah I went with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you
I went wandering

I went drifting through the capitals of tin
Where men cant walk
Or freely talk
And sons turn their fathers in
I stopped outside a church house
Where the citizens like to sit
They say they want the kingdom
But they don't want God in it

I went out riding
Down that ol' eight lane
I passed by a thousand signs
Looking for my own name

I went with nothing

But the thought you'd be there too
Looking for you

I went out there
In search of experience
To taste and to touch
And to feel as much
As a man can
Before he repents

I went out searching, lookin' for one good man
A spirit who would not bend or break
Who would sit at his fathers right hand
I went out walking with a Bible and a gun
The word of God lay heavy on my heart
I was sure I was the one
Now Jesus, don't you wait up
Jesus, Ill be home soon
Yeah I went out for the papers
Told her Id be back by noon

Yeah I left with nothing
But the thought you'd be there too
Looking for you
Yeah I left with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you
I went wandering",The Wanderer

You don't love me any more baby please forgive me

And tomorrow I'll remember when you turned to me and said

And the winter still follows the fall

But I never thought
It still would be broken in two

They tell me time is a natural healer
It kinda smooths the pain away
But this hurtin' within
Hasn't yet given in
And it seems like a million days

And your eyes that were beautifully blue
And I can still hear the sound of your voice
When you said we were through

There've been evenings when I couldn't sleep
Oh, my life will be fine for months at a time
Then I'll break down and cry for a week
Cause when I told you I'd love you forever
I know you didn't think it was true
But forever is nothing
Compared to some nights I've been through
These years after you

Go crazy every time
When I know down deep inside
You don't love me

Wind blowing through your hair
Well I'm starting to make

I reached out one night
And you were gone
Don't know why you'd run,
What you're running to or from
All I know is I want to bring you home

So I'm walking in the rain,
Thumbing for a ride
On this lonely Kentucky backroad
I've loved you much too long
My love's too strong
To let you go, never knowing
What went wrong

Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town
That I'll be walking through
With the rain in my shoes,
Searching for you

Sitting on a bench
Outside a general store

Eddie Rabbitt,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Drivin' My Life Away [Single/LP Version]

Eddie Rabbitt,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much

Eddie Rabbitt,"When a man cheats on a woman it's understood he's just a man
But when a woman cheats on her man no one forgives
I drove her out into the night with teardrops in her eyes
And only now I realize the fool I've been

Why couldn't I love her and try to understand her
Instead I said things that I regret
Why couldn't I just hold her and say it didn't matter
Why couldn't I forgive and forget

It's not her fault she slipped one time she never was the cheating kind
But when a woman's unsatisfied she's bound to roam
But I got mad I just saw red I never heard a word she said
And what I'd give to have her back here in my arms",Forgive and Forget
Eddie Rabbitt,"Pure love
Baby, it's pure love
Milk and honey and Captain Crunch
And you in the morning

Pure love
You're the picture of pure love
Ninety-nine and forty-four one-hundreds
Percent pure love

I wake up with sunshine
Layin' beside me
And bluebirds singing right outside my window
Soft, warm kisses
Say good morning
And then I get breakfast in bed
You know you make me so happy

With pure love

Eddie Rabbitt,"I promised me the next time you came 'round
I could look you in the eye and turn you down
But when you stand there in my door, it's such a sin
'Cause one more time I'm gonna let you in

I let you get to me one sweet word at a time
I let you get to me one sweet kiss at a time
And I know when it's over, it won't really be
'Cause every time I let you get to me

Your fingers feel like fire on my skin
Your misty eye satisfied again
And you said you just dropped by to say hello
And here we are where I didn't wanna go

I let you get to me one sweet word at a time
I let you get to me one sweet kiss at a time
And I know when it's over, it won't really be
'Cause every time I let you get to me

Eddie Reed,"In my imagination, I'm finding consolation
Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing
Someone along the Rio Grande
 
It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine

Eddie Reed,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",Love Is Here to Stay
Eddie Reed,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile
Eddie Russ,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Eddie Russell,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Eddie Russell,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April

Sin quererte me acostumbre a tus caricias
Me sentí un rey, nunca había tenido un amor
Tan fiel con el que jugué toda una vida

Al darme cuenta que te engañe ya no quería
Que disolvieras este gran amor que yo sentía
Si me escucharas solo una ves yo te diría
Que por tener de nuevo tu amor todo daría

A pensar que no ahí un camino para seguir sin ti

Sí, ahora es tiempo que sigas andando sin mí a tu lado
Sí, abandono tus besos, tu cuerpo que tanto gocé
Renuncio al calor que saciaba mis ansias
Te dejo porque más ya no quiero perder

Me fallaste, me fallaste
Tú no sabes ser fiel, me fallaste
Tú no sabes querer, me fallaste
Ya tú no cambiarás, me fallaste

Ahora es tiempo que sigas andando sin mí a tu lado
Sí, abandono tus besos, tu cuerpo que tanto gocé
Renuncio al calor que saciaba mis ansias
Te dejo porque más ya no quiero perder

Me fallaste, me fallaste
Tú no sabes ser fiel, me fallaste
Tú no sabes querer, me fallaste
Ya tú no cambiarás, me fallaste

Me fallaste, tú no sabes querer
Chica que desilusión why que mal sabor has dejado en mi corazón
Me fallaste, tú no sabes querer
En verdad abusaste de mis sentimientos fallaste a tu promesa

Me fallaste, tú no sabes querer
Es que tú no sabes querer, tú no sabes lo que es eso
Me fallaste, tú no sabes querer
No, no, vengas pidiendo disculpas, te digo
No quiero, no quiero, no quiero, no quiero

No puedo, lárgate, me molestan las mentiras why fallaste
Me fallaste, tú no sabes querer, renuncio al calor
Que saciaba mis ansias why que tú has destrozado
Me fallaste, tú no sabes querer aunque yo he fracasado contigo

Otro amor me dará lo que pido, ya lo verás
Me fallaste, muchacha, pero que mala decisión
Me fallaste al fallarle a mi cariño, me fallaste
A la larga perderás, me fallaste, eso yo te lo aseguro
Me fallaste why de qué manera

Eddie Santiago,"Perdido, como un gorrión sin nido 
Hoy vuelvo por tu amor, si aun me quieres hazme sitio 
Perdido, como un ave sin destino 
Así me encuentro hoy medio loco triste y vació 
Me faltas tu

Déjame sentirte entre mis brazos 
Deja que sea yo quien diga te amo 
Déjame volver y ser tu abrigo 
Quiero recobrar lo que fue mio 

Entiendo que te asombres o te rías 
Jamas pensé volver pero ves así es la vida 
me tienes con el corazón rendido 
envuelto en soledad

Eddie Santiago,"Cabalgaré toda la noche
Por una senda colorida
Mis besos te daré en derroche
De una manera algo atrevida

Me aferraré de tus cabellos
Por no caer de ese galope
Voy a atender a mis anhelos
Antes que el día nos sofoque

Me perderé de madrugada
Para encontrarte en mi abrazo
Después de nuestra cabalgata
Me acostaré en tu regazo

Sin importar si en ese instante
Soy dominado o si domino
Me sentiré como un gigante
O tan pequeño como un niño

why las estrellas del lugar
Se nos acercan para ver
Why aún conservan su brillar
Después de nuestro amanecer

why en la grandeza de ese instante
Mi amor cabalga sin saber
Que en la belleza de esa hora
El sol espera por nacer

Cabalgare sobre tu cuerpo
Toda la noche disfrutaremos
Lo divino del placer

Cabalgare sobre tu cuerpo
Me aferrare de tus cabellos
Al galopar sobre tu piel

Cabalgare sobre tu cuerpo
Why yo cabalgare lleno de amor
Toda la noche

Cablagare sobre tu cuerpo
Mis besos te dare toda la noche
De una manera algo atrevida

Cabalgare sobre tu cuerpo
Cabalgare toda la noche

Eddie Santiago,"Al fin estamos solos y yo te quiero expresar 
La pasión que siento fuerte y que no puedo ocultar
La vida es una aventura y ambos podemos ahogar 
Con caricias y ternuras nuestro deseo de amar

Yo se que tu sientes por dentro lo mismo que yo
Cuando beso tus labios tiemblas de pasión
Y cuando me signo a tu cuerpo siento el palpitar
De tu corazón y tu cuerpo se quiere entregar

Hagámoslo, y no perdamos tiempo
Que juntos gocemos del momento
Dejemos correr nuestros cuerpos con el sentimiento
Que es justo lo que ambos queremos y es tan natural

Hagámoslo, y lo demás no importa
Olvídate de reglas y de normas
Unidos para encontrar nuevas formas
Sin miedo con nuestras roturas podernos saciar

Al fin estamos solos

Une tu cuerpo al mío, hagámoslo 
Nena no perdamos tiempo, hagámoslo es tiempo de amar, vivámoslo

Une tu cuerpo al mío, hagámoslo
Al fin estamos solos y debemos ahogar, el deseo que nos consume

Une tu cuerpo al mío, hagámoslo
Dejemos que nuestros cuerpos hablen de amor
Olvidándonos del tiempo y de todo

Une tu cuerpo al mío, hagámoslo
Ven y hagámoslo

Eso es así jaja

Eddie Santiago,"Hoy he pensado no vivir más cosido a tu vestido
Soy convencido de que tu cuerpo sólo busca variedad
Quieres amar bordadas con blancas cortinas de inocencia
Quieres saltar de brazo en brazo como es negra tu conciencia

Para que vuelves, si fuiste ciega frente a todo mi tormento
Es imposible que puedas darte a un sólo hombre mucho tiempo
Para que vuelves, tú necesitas siempre besos diferentes
Cambias de cama por cada sol que a fin de noche sea naciente

Hoy he pensado no vivir más cosido a tu vestido
Hoy convencido de que tu cuerpo sólo busca variedad
Quieres brindar tu cruel deseo a los demás por temporada
Luego volar, por alcanzarte muchos se rompen sus alas

Para que vuelves, si fuiste ciega frente a todo mi tormento
Es imposible que puedas darte a un sólo hombre mucho tiempo
Para que vuelves, tú necesitas siempre besos diferentes
Cambias de cama por cada sol que a fin de noche sea naciente

Cambias de cama por cada sol que a fin de noche sea naciente
Cambias de cama por cada sol que a fin de noche sea naciente

Para que vuelves
Si en ti no está la seriedad amando
Para que vuelves
Buscas para tu cuerpo variedad

Para que vuelves
Tú necesitas besos diferentes
Para que vuelves
Quítate de mi vida, vete ya

Para que vuelves
Dime porque quiero saber
Para que vuelves
No puedes dar tu amor a un sólo hombre

Para que vuelves
Fuiste ciega frente a todo mi tormento
Para que vuelves
Para que vuelves, para que vuelves

Yo no debo alejarme de ti 
Si lo único que hago bien, es amarte 
En todo lo demás vivo intentando 
Solo tu puedes salvarme 
Es algo infantil lo que te pido 
Soy consciente se precisan otras cosas, otras cosas 
No se vive solamente de cariño 
Y en un páramo suelen nacer las rosas 
Solo puedo prometerte que a mi lado 
No podrá abrumarte la rutina 
Estarás de sobresalto en sobresalto 
Llenare cada rincón de nuestras vidas 
Hoy te propongo que compartas mi bohemia 
Y que sepas valorar a la pobreza 
Será como vivir en una isla, a la voz naturaleza 

Por eso yo no debo alejarme de ti 
Si lo único que hago bien, es amarte 
No hagas que me sienta un ser inútil 
Ahora que ya se a que dedicarme 
Hay infinidad de carpinteros 
Y no se que cantidad de comerciantes

Tu amante, no lo olvides 

Hoy yo descubrí que soy tu amante 
Sin darme cuenta comprendí que tu 
Eres lo mejor de mis momentos 
Hoy yo descubrí que soy tu amante 
El amor que vivimos tan loco y 
Apresurado es nuestro escape del mundo que nos rodea 
Hoy yo descubrí que soy tu amante 
Ser amante es respirar placer en lo mejor de cada instante 
Hoy yo descubrí que soy tu amante 
Tu tienes picardía y fuego en la piel 
Me excitas a que te tenga que querer

Eddie Santiago,"Todo empezó en el invierno pasado (que bien) 
Me enamoré sin querer y sin pensarlo (ya ves) 
Creí tener la oportunidad de amar y ser feliz 
Cuando descubrí tanto amor junto a ti

Todo empezó en el momento indicado (que bien) 
Ojos café, un blue jeans medio gastado (recién) 
Te vi pasar desde mi carro y me arroje detrás de ti 
¿Quieres caminar conmigo si?

Y juntos nos fuimos del brazo con la tarde a cuesta 
La brisa riendo en tu cara de niña traviesa 
Y juntos nos fuimos del brazo con la tarde a cuesta 
La noche llegó con un beso y miradas inquietas 
Y unas copas que se suben poco a poco a la cabeza 
Y un abrazo cuerpo a cuerpo y en la puerta la inocencia 

Todo empezó en el momento indicado (que bien) 
Mi corazón ya estaba decepcionado, sin fe 
Pero tu amor cambió mi suerte y yo estoy aquí amándote 
Y después de amar te amaré aún mas",Todo Empezo

Nuestro ventanal se asoma el día
Y siento tu calor aferrado a mi piel
Estas dormida

No se sí despertarte con un beso
Me siento tan feliz al contemplarte
Quisiera por tus sueños internarme
Que nadie nos separé

En esta habitación vivimos nuestro
Amor del mundo oculto
Sabiendo que después vendrá la
Realidad así es la vida

No sé cómo expresarte lo que siento
Es breve nuestro amor y es tan inmenso
Quisiera entre tus barcos refugiarme
Que nadie nos separé

Quisiera detener el tiempo
Y olvidar las horas
Porque la dicha es un instante
Y yo la siento ahora

No sé si despertarte con un beso
Me siento tan feliz al contemplarte
Quisiera por tus sueños internarme
Que nadie nos separé

Es breve pero es inmenso
Este momento de amor
Tú y yo recibiendo la mañana
En la cama haciéndolo

Es breve pero es inmenso
Este momento de amor
Es breve el tiempo pero el disfrute
Que conseguimos nos llena

Es breve pero es inmenso
Este momento de amor
Como me quieres tú como te quiero yo
Vale la pena vivir

Tu respirar agitado y tus
Suspiros me excitan

Es breve pero es inmenso
Este momento de amor
Viviendo este amor oculto
Es como vivir nuestro propio mundo

Es breve pero es inmenso
Este momento de amor
Cuando lo hacemos
La entrega es mutua

Es breve pero es inmenso
Este momento de amor
Me gusta contemplarte desnuda
Siempre que estas en mi lecho

Es breve pero es inmenso
Este momento de amor
Que sea interminable

Let me tell you, a fortune like that once was mine

When I lost her I was lost beyond despair

A heavy rain a fallin'

I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

I believe it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just got to do your own thing

I find me a place in a box car
So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I'm all right

Eddie Skuller,"I lost myself on a cool damp night
I gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree

I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see 
And be what I want to be

When I think more than I want to think
I do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you
 
Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
Listen to me, I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she, coming to me nearly here? 

Lilac wine is sweet and heady where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love? 
Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isn't that she, or am I just going crazy, dear?

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Eddie South,"Carolina 
Gave me Dinah; 
I'm the proudest one 
Beneath the Dixie sun. 

News is spreadin' 
'Bout our weddin'; 
I hear church bells ringin', 
Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Eddie South,"Yesterday you came my way,
And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Eddie South,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity

Eddie South,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street
Eddie Spaghetti,"The bartender's working on a late night shift
She's bonka blonds and bon aims on a midnight drift
And the dance band's playing the same old slam
I'm sinking whiskey and you're sipping fine wine
I don't know what it is you're trying to prove
Well it should be you but it's me who can hardly move
And I've got my reputation lying on the line
Come on baby, be a good dog and help the blind

Won't you carry me home
(like a truck, pick me up)

You ain't no lady but you've sure got taste in men
That head of yours has got you by time and time again
My arms and legs are aching and my head's about to blow
And your back's been breakin' and I'd hate to spoil the show
But I've just spent next weeks wages and I'm right out of coin
But you want more and it's half past four and they want

To close the joint
But we can't afford a taxi, and it's too late for the
Bus
But I've been told by friends of mine you're someone I
Can trust

Won't you carry me home
(don't let me lie here in all this beer)

You drank all your booze and half of mine
I'm bleary eyed and you're waiting for the sunshine (to
Come and kill me)
Just like the man who threw me on the floor
Don't matter, while I'm down here I might as well try
And find the f**king door
Excuse me, have you seen my swizzle stick
And have you got a plastic bag 'cause I'm gonna be sick
I'm dead drunk and heave'n hanging upside down
And you're getting up and leaving, you think I'm gonna
Drown

Won't you carry me home",Carry Me Home
Eddie Spaghetti,"Yesterday a sad goodbye
I told you that it wouldn't be for long
But it seems like a thousand years since I've been gone
Oh, what I'd give to hold you in my arms
Can't you see how much I need you tonight
I'm going crazy girl, can't get you off of my mind
Everyday that I live without you
I just can't help but dream about you
Everywhere I go
And after all the love that I've left behind me
You're the one I keep inside me
Everywhere I go... I get that feeling
It's hard to be so far apart
When thoughts of you keep coming on so strong
I picture you in every face I see
Now I know I left a part of me back home with you
There's nothing like falling for the very first time
I won't forget you girl, for the rest of my life
Everyday that I live without you
I just can't help but dream about you
Everywhere I go
And after all the love that I've left behind me

Got a mind full of questions and a teacher in my soul

Holding me like gravity are places that pull
If ever there was someone to keep me at home
It would be you

Everyone I come across in cages they bought
They think of me and my wandering
But I'm never what they thought
Got my indignation but I'm pure in all my thoughts
I'm alive

Wind in my hair, I feel part of everywhere
Underneath my being is a road that disappeared

A big hard sun
Beaten on the big people
In the big hard world

When she comes to greet me
She is mercy at my feet
When I see her pin her charm
She just throws it back again
Once I dug an early grave
To find a better land
She just smiled and laughed at me
And took her blues back again

When I saw what I had done
Bound down and flew away the hours
Of her garden and her sun
So I tried to warn her
I'll turn to see her weep

And it's still coming down on me

Eddie Vedder,"Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""
Birds singin’ in the sycamore trees
Dream a little dream of me

Say nighty-night and kiss me
Hold me tight and tell me you’ll miss me
'Cause I’m alone as blue as can be

Ever fell before
I'm falling fast while hoping
I'll land in your arms
'Cause all my time is spent here
Longing to belong
To you

I dream of circles perfect
Eyes within your face
My heart's an open wound that
Only you'd replace
And though the moon is rising
Can't put your picture down
Love can be frightening when you fall

And when the time is right, I

There's nothing I can do about it
And a little bit of love that I get
May be all that you can give
But I can't live without it

One little thought to me

Nearer to your heart?

Before we drifted apart
Once in a while?

In love's smouldering embers
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
The spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented

The hurt don't show but who knows, time will tell
I believe in nothing but the pain

Forever never be the same

Crashed and on their way
Father he enjoyed collisions others walked away
Like snowflakes falls in May
And the doors are open now as the bells are ringing out
'Cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow
Goodbye for now

Nature has its own religion gospel from the land
Father ruled by long division, young men they pretend
Old men comprehend

And the clouds breaks at dawn shedding light upon this town
They'll all come around
As the man of the hour is taking his final bow
Goodbye for now

And the road
The old man paved
The broken seams along the way
The rusted signs, left just for me

As the curtain comes down
I feel that this is just goodbye for now",Man of the Hour
Eddie Vedder,"Don't let anyone say that it's just a game
For I've seen other teams and it's never the same
When you're born in Chicago you're blessed and you're healed
The first time you walk into Wrigley Field
Our heroes wear pinstripes, heroes in blue
Give us the chance to feel like heroes too
Forever we'll win and if we should lose
We know someday we'll go all the way
Yeah, someday we'll go all the way

We are one with the Cubs, with the Cubs we're in love
Yeah, hold our head high as the underdogs
We are not fair-weather but foul-weather fans
We're like brothers in arms in the streets and the stands
There's magic in the ivy and the old scoreboard
The same one I stared at as a kid keeping score
In a world full of greed, I could never want more
And someday we'll go all the way
Yeah, someday we'll go all the way
Yeah, someday we'll go all the way
Yeah, someday we'll go all the way
Yeah, someday we'll go all the way

And here's to the men and the legends we've known
Teaching us faith and giving us hope
United we stand and united we'll fall
Down to our knees the day we win it all

And Ernie Banks said ""oh, let's play two""
Or did he mean two hundred years?
In the same ballpark, our diamond, our jewel
The home of our joy and our tears
Keeping traditions and wishes made new
A place where our grandfathers, fathers they grew
A spiritual feeling if I ever knew
And if you ain't been I am sorry for you
And when the day comes with that last winning run
And I'm crying and covered in beer
I'll look to the sky and know I was right
To think someday we'll go all the way
Yeah, someday we'll go all the way
Yeah, someday we'll go all the way
Yeah, someday we'll go all the way

Eddie Zip,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues
Eddie Zip,"Evenings are crowded with memories
Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining

I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

Yes, someone to call me their own
Oh, I wish I had someone to live with

Oh, please meet me tonight in the moonlight
Oh, please meet me tonight all alone
For I have a sad story to tell you
It's a story that's never been told.

I'll be carried to the new jail tomorrow
Leaving my poor darling alone
With the cold prison bars all around me
And my head on a pillow of stone.
Now, I have a grand ship on the ocean
All mounted with silver and gold
And before my poor darling would suffer
Oh, that ship would be anchored and sold.
Now if I had the wings like an angel
Over these prison walls I would fly
And I'd fly to the arms of my darling
And there I'd be willing to die",The Prisonner Song

Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
I guess I never told you
That I am so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied

I just never took the time

Lives an old German's daughter
By the banks of the old river Rhine

Look up toward the heavens each night
When the stars seem to shine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you

Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind
In a moment of glory

Eddy Arnold,"Seems that I don't think about you too much
And I'm not too sure why I thought of you now
Time has a way of numbing the touch but I still recall when you left me
Just how much it hurts me to stand there just watching you leave
I couldn't believe it was true
After moments we shared and the souls that we bared I've never loved anyone more
But like I said I don't think of you much
There's someone beside me who helps me forget
He's shown me how not to think of you now but when I remember you I don't regret
That we couldn't hold on to the dreams that we shared

Now I woke up this morning a quarter past three
I just couldn't realize this could happen to me
That's all she wrote

Now listen pretty mama you know you done me wrong
Didn't even give a warning till after you were gone
That's all you wrote

Now someday you'll be sorry your heart will ache with pain
You'd give a million dollars to write that note again

Now listen all you ramblers who think your girl is true
Don't ever be too certain or you'll be singing too

But when you ask forgiveness I'll just say travel on
That's all I'll write won't write more
The gloom will then be hanging round your front door",That's All She Wrote
Eddy Arnold,"Now after loving you what else is there to do
Cause darling all the rest will just be second best
I know I'll go tonight comparing them to you
I'll be no good to anyone after loving you

And heartaches will remain for they can't re-eraze
Many loves may come along but they won't live up to you
I'll be no good to anyone after loving you

Anytime you say, you want me back again

And you find true friends are few

The coyotes are howlin'
Way out where the doggies roam.
Where spurs are a jinglin'
And the cowboy is singin'
His lonesome cattle call.

He rides in the sun,
'Til his days work is done.
And rounds up the cattle each fall.
Singin' his cattle call.

For hours he would ride.
On the range far and wide.
When the night wind blows up and slow.
His heart is a feather.

My heart would cry more than the weeping willow tree
If my darling and her heart were not for me

Eddy Arnold,"(His robe his robe the robe of calvary
Twas worn by my redeemer who lives eternaly)

Kings wear robes of gold and velvet soon their glory fades away
But the king of kings in heaven wore a homespun robe that day
Soldiers gambled for his garment while the sun turned dark above
But the men who crucified him were forgiven by his love

His robe his robe...

Those who saw his robe knew torment if they lived by sin and fault
But if they renounce the evil they were welcome by the Lord
Though it seems so plain and humble there was fate in every breath
He who wore that lives forever he has risen from the death

His robe his robe...

Just to know I've done my best as I go to take my rest

The scent of wildflowers in the air is just the touch of God's hand
The wasteland fall that fills the sky the hum of wild wings sailing by
The warm earth bed on which I lie is just the touch of God's hand)

The desert yields a water pool where wild things meet their thirst to cool

He sent his servant into town to the house where she was dwelling
Said you must come to my Master if your name'd be Barbara Allen

So slowly slowly she got up and slowly she came nigh him
But the only thing she said to him young man I think you're dying

Oh I am sick so very sick and death is on me dwelling
No better I will ever be if I can't have Barbara Allen

Eddy Arnold,"I can't recall my mother I don't remember dad
Mister and Mississippi was all I ever had
Oh I was born to wander oh I was born to roam
And Mister and Mississippi made me feel at home

Oh I was born to wander...

My cradle was the river my school a river boat
My teacher was a gambler the slickest one afloat
He taught me not to gamble on a petticoat

My teacher was a gambler...
Oh I was born to wander...

Oh Betty Mae I love you I love you Betty Mae
I love you like a barefoot boy loves a summer day
The way a wand'ring gypsy loves the changing scenes
Just like the restless river loves old New Orleans

Oh I was born to wander...

Eddy Arnold,"Moonlight and magnolia, starlight in your hair
All the world a dream come true
Did it really happen, was I really there, was I really there with you?
 
We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night

Eddy Arnold,"As I walked out in the streets of Laredo, 
As I walked out in Laredo one day, 
I spied a young cowboy wrapped up in white linen, 
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay.

""Oh beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly;
Sing the Death March as you carry me along. 
Take me to the valley, there lay the sod o'er me, 
I'm a young cowboy and know IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve done wrong.""

""I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy."" 
These words he did say as I boldly walked by. 
""Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story; 
Got shot in the breast and I know I must die!"" 

""My friends and relations they live in the Nation:
They know not where their dear boy has gone.
I first came to Texas and hired to a ranchman,
Oh I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong.""

""It was once in the saddle I used to go dashing:
It was once in the saddle I used to go gay.
First to the dram house and then to the card house,
Got shot in the breast and I'm dying today.""

""Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin;
Get six pretty maidens to sing me a song.
Put bunches of roses all over my coffin,
Put roses to deaden the sods as they fall.""

""Go gather around you a group of young cowboys,
And tell them the story of this my sad fate.
Tell one and the other before they go further,
To stop their wild roving before it's too late.""

""Oh, bury me beside my knife and my shooter,
My spurs on my heels, my rifle by my side.
And over my coffin put a bottle of brandy,
That the cowboys may drink as they carry me along.""

""Go fetch me some water, a cool cup of water 
To cool my parched lips,"" the poor cowboy then said. 
Before I returned his spirit had left him 
Had gone to his Maker, the cowboy was dead. 

We beat the drum slowly and played the fife lowly,
And bitterly wept as we bore him along.
For we all loved our comrade, so brave, young, and handsome,
We all loved our comrade although he'd done wrong.",The Streets of Laredo

When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced him to my loved one

Now I know just how much I have lost

Not a mill that I haven't been through
But when you're standin' close to me I don't know what to do

It's kinda silly I must admit to let you scare me right out of my wits
But when your eyes look into mine well all I can see it's a danger sign
I take the tiger by the tail take the bull by the horns
Look the bear right square in the eye
And one of these days just wait and see a wild cat I will be
I'll pick up and carry you off and take you home with me

Eddy Arnold,"From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
From the queen of flowin' mountains to the south bells by the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome and known quite well by all
She's the combination of the Wabash Cannonball

Listen to the jingle the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland through the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear that lonesome hoboes call
You're trav'ling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball

She came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she rolled into the station you could hear the people say
There's a girl from Tennessee she's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball

And always be remembered in the courts of Alabam
His earthly race is over and the curtains round him fall
We'll carry him home to Vict'ry on the Wabash Cannonball

Sayin' Steve you're way behind time
This is not '38 but this it's old '97
You must put her in Spencer on time

He turned around and said to his black greasy fireman
Just shovel on a little more coal
And when we cross that White Oak Mountain
You can watch old '97 roll

He was goin' down the grade makin' ninety miles an hour
His whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle
A scalded to death by the steam

It's a mighty rough road from Lynchburg to Danville
With a line on a three mile grade
It was on this grade that he lost his air brakes
And he see what a jump we made

And wild and sweet the words repeat of peace on earth goodwill to men

Had rolled along the unbroken song of peace on earth goodwill to men

And in despair I bowed my head there is no peace on earth I said

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep

Down the chimney broad and black with your pack you'll creep
All the stockings you will find hanging in a row
Mine will be the shortest one you'll be sure to know

Nelly wants a storybook, she thinks dolls are folly

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Now the war was over and their life could begin
Molly saw her darling standing at the door again

It's so nice to hear your voice again Molly
So nice to feel your arms around me Molly
Oh how happy I'd be if I only could see you
Sweet sweet Molly please don't cry

Maybe I should have written to let you know ahead a time
But I was afraid that you'd worry if you knew that I'd gone blind
Do I hear you crying Molly please don't cry you silly thing
See what you've done you've even brought a tear into my eye

Oh how happy I'd be if I only could see you
Sweet sweet Molly please don't cry

Where's my son why does he looks like Molly
Everybody says he took after me Lord I wish I could see

Guess he'll get used to me in time won't he Molly

Why do the birds go on singing why do the stars glow above
Don't they know it's the end of the world it ended when I lost your love

I wake up in the morning and I wonder why everything's the same as it was
I can't understand no I can't understand how life goes on the way it does

Four walls to see

But here where you've left me, I'll stay

I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

Then suddenly I got that old time feeling I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

That today was our last day
I said there'd be no sorrow
That I'd laugh when you walked away

Full of funny as you went out the door
That I'd have another one waiting

Eddy Arnold,"Come all you rounders, if you wanna hear
The story 'bout a brave engineer
Casey Jones was the rounder's name
On a 68 wheeler, boys, he won his fame

The caller called Casey at a half past four
He kissed his wife at the station door
Mounted to the cabin with his orders in his hand
And it took his final trip to the Promised Land

Casey Jones mounted to the cabin
Casey Jones with the orders in his hand
Casey Jones mounted to the cabin
And it took his final trip to the Promised Land

Put in your water and shovel your coal
Put your head out the window watch the drivers roll
I'll run her till she leaves the rails
'Cause I made hours late with the western mail

He looked at his watch but the watch was slow
He looked at the water and the water was low
He looked at the fireman and then he said
""We're gonna reach Frisco Buffalo'd be dead""

Casey Jones gonna reach Frisco
Casey Jones Buffalo'd be dead
Casey Jones we're gonna reach Frisco
We're gonna reach Frisco Buffalo'd be dead

Casey pulled up that Reno hill
He whistled for the crossing with an awful shrill
The switchman knew by the engine's moan
That the man at the throttle was Casey Jones

He pulled up within two miles of the place
There number four stared him straight in the face
He turned to his fireman, said, ""Boy, you'd better jump
'Cause there's two locomotives that are going to bump""

Casey Jones two locomotives
Casey Jones that's going to bump
Casey Jones two locomotives
There's two locomotives that's going to bump

Casey said just before he died
""There're two more roads that I'd like to ride""
The fireman said, ""Would that be
The Northern Pacific and the Santa Fe""

Mrs. Jones sat at on her bed a sighin'
Just to see the message that Casey was dyin'
Go to bed children and stop your cryin'
'Cause daddy's still a ridin' that heavenly line

Casey Jones mounted to the cabin
Casey Jones with the orders in his hand
Casey Jones mounted to the cabin
And it took his final trip to the Promised Land

Eddy Arnold,"The days gone by are drifting through my memory
The days gone by are shadding in my heart
How often have I closed my eyes so I might see
The days gone by that never quite depart

Old friends hello I called to you across the years
And then my heart I hear your soft reply
Old friends hello though we're apart I'm near you see
Oh how I love to dream of days gone by

",Days Gone By
Eddy Arnold,"Everybody asks me if I still love you and if you're still on my mind
They ask me to tell about my broken heart and I tell 'em that I'm feelin' fine
So I lie a little bit and I proudly say our book of love is closed
And your memory never bothers me and when it does it comes and goes

It comes and goes all right it comes every morning and it goes all night
I save a lotta pride and I haven't really lied
I tell 'em that it comes and goes

Everybody asks me if I cried when you left me and if I've cried for you since
They ask me to tell so they can all get together and laugh it up at my expense
So I lie a little bit and I proudly say not one teardrop flows
If there is a little pain it's not a constant thing it kinda just comes and goes

It comes and goes all right it comes every morning and it goes all night
I save a lot of pride and I haven't really lied
I tell 'em that it comes and goes.

I know that you want me to
But too much waters run under that old bridge
There's too many rivers between me and you

There's just too many rivers to cross babe
Too many dreams have been lost
And there's too many long nights I've turned and tossed
There's too many rivers to cross

Now don't think for a moment I blame only you

I've done some things I never thought I'd ever do
Now as I stand here looking down at you
You ask me why it is I frown I guess it's cause I've been to town

I've been to town beyond the boulevard and down the beach
I've learned some things that only time can teach
For instance love is more than just a speech
It's got to find a common ground I know because I've been to town

Don't tell me any more lies I can't waste any more years
I've seen my image in your eyes dissolve in disappointed tears
I've been to town you ask me do I know the Milky Way
I do and furthermore I'd like to say it isn't milky white it's dirty gray

Every little thing I'd do for you it only pleases me when it pleases you

Eddy Arnold,"(Don't you touch me if you don't love me)

Your hand is like a torch each time you touch me
That look in your eyes pulls me apart
Don't open the door to heaven if I can't come in
Don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheart

Your kiss is like a drink when I'm thirsty
And I'm thirsty for you with all my heart
Don't love me then act as though we've never kissed
Don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheart

Don't give me something that you might take away
To have you then lose you wouldn't be smart on my part
Don't open the door to heaven if I can't come in
Don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheart",Don't Touch Me
Eddy Arnold,"Here comes more tears to cry here comes more heartaches by
Here comes my baby back again
Here comes more misery here come old memories

Eddy Arnold,"Well I said if you're happy that I'm glad
At times for all the fun that we've had
I said if it's over I hope that you walk through fields of clover
But that's a lie I hope you're sad

Well I said I wish all the best to you
And good luck to your someone new
I said if it's true love then go ahead and take all my best with you love
But that's a lie I hope you're blue

If I'm not careful you'll catch me in a lie
And all I have to do is look at you and you'll see a grown man cry

A thing called sadness not much of a friend when you walked out it walked in
It's in every chair where I sit down it follows me all over town
A thing called sadness not much of a friend when you walked out it walked in

What in the world am I going to do this old friend can't take the place of you
It only brings back memories of you and all the things that we used to do

Eddy Arnold,"Why did you tell me that you love me
When you really didn't love me oh darling why
And why did you let me dream on
Now the pretty dream's gone and all I can do is cry
And I will never understand it
Was that the way you planned it was it all just a lie
Goodbye you broke the heart I gave you
But someday your heart will break too
And you'll wonder why

And you'll wonder why",Why

My world's so cold and empty since you've gone
Baby sweet sweet baby
Without you I don't know how I'll go on

You're gonna know what it means to be lonely
You're gonna know what it means to be blue
You're gonna know how it feels to feel your heart breaking in two
When the wheel of hurt comes wheeling round to you

I'll see you're crying bitter tears one day baby
I'll hear you say you're so sorry we are through
I'll be the first one to have you because you'll need someone that's true
When the wheel of hurt comes wheeling round to you

You're gonna learn the truth the hard way but what you learn you'll always know
That it's bad luck to hurt somebody when that somebody loves you so

Eddy Arnold,"What do you do when your world stops turning
To start your world turning again

You know you should leave get her out of your mind
Turn the page close the door say goodbye
You know that it's hopeless she's gone like the wind
Your world won't start turning again

What do you do when your world stops turning
And the torch starts burning again
What do you do when your hearts starts hurting
To start your world turning again

You live without night and you live without day

You hope that it's maybe she'll come back
And then your world will start turning again

Eddy Arnold,"(We'll hide away in our castle made of walls)

Close the blinds draw the drapes lock the doors
Tonight our home will be just mine and yours
Take the phone off the hook so no one will intrude
No jingling bell to break the spell and spoil the mood

Turn down the lights and make the music soft and low
There's no one else on earth but us for all we know
We're king and queen of all we survey here in our love hide away
Till daylight falls on our castle made of walls

Turn down the lights...
We'll hide away in our castle made of walls

Eddy Arnold,"It sure gets lonely alone no one to cry to alone
Time sure goes slower since you're gone don't keep me lonely too long
I need to hold you in my arms and hear you say you need me
Don't let me live on dreams alone don't keep me lonely too long

Mem'ries are bad for one so lonely
My tortured heart cries out because it loves and wants you only
Yes I'm too lonely alone afraid I can't stand alone
Without your love I can't go on don't keep me lonely too long




",Don't Keep Me Lonely Too Long
Eddy Arnold,"That faint sweet smell of her perfume a powder box that plays a tune
Lacy objects around the room that's all that's left of my baby
The record that she loved to play some clothes she hadn't put away
Some bills of hers I'll have to pay that's all that's left of my baby

But baby's gone to my regret for baby wants my baby gets
I was just a stepping stone she's stepping nigher now baby's gone
I could give her things away reminders that she's gone to stay

Eddy Arnold,"Once I had a secret love that lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star the way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are and why I'm so in love with you

Just for one branch I'd search my whole life through
I've heard them say a greener land is waiting there
Where peaple wake and find their dreams come true

Above the clouds beyond the stormy sea
I long to share a world of sweet contentment there
In that bright land where grows the olive tree

So let me fly please lead me and I'll follow you...

It lingered there to touch your hair and walk with me
All summer long we sang our song and strolled a golden sand

The world was new beneath the blue umbrella sky
Then softer than a piper man one day it called to you
I lost you to the summer wind (the summer wind)

And guess who sighs these lullabys through nights that never end

Eddy Arnold,"YESTERDAY WHEN I WAS YOUNG
Writers Charles Aznavour, Herbert Kretzmer

Yesterday when I was young the taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue. I teased at life as if it were a foolish game, the way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame. The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned I always built alas on weak and shifting sand. I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day and only now I see how the years ran away. Yesterday when I was young so many drinking songs were waiting to be sung, so many wayward pleasures lay in store for me and so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see. I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out, I never stopped to think what life was all about and every conversation I can now recall concerned itself with me and nothing else at all. Yesterday the moon was blue and every crazy day brought something new to do. I used my magic age as if it were a wand and never saw the waste and emptiness beyond. The game of love I played with arrogance and pride and every flame I lit too quickly quickly died. The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away and only I am left on stage to end the play. There are so many songs in me that won't be sung; I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue. The time has come for me to pay for yesterday when I was young.



",Yesterday When I Was Young
Eddy Arnold,"Your walls are lines with pictures of your triumphs through the years
Your doors is bolted tight against all wordly want and fear
But you left your passion and your pain with your first love back in school
You fool you fool

In your penthouse high from the dirty streets I swear you'll never find
The answers to the questions that muddy up your mind
For your window shades are drawn upon the wicked and the cruel
You fool you fool

You give your share the charity without a second thought
And you are kind to animals for that's what you've been taught
But all your real emotion you proudly overrule
You fool you fool

You've planned your life so carefully for society's delight
And still you can't quite understand why things just don't seem right
It's a love like fresh out homemade bread will sat aside to cool
You fool you fool you fool",You Fool
Eddy Arnold,"I just can't help believin'
When she smiles up soft and gentle
With a trace of misty mornin'
And the promise of tomorrow in her eyes

And I just can't help believin'
When she's lyin' close beside me
And my heart beats with the rhythm of her sighs

This time the girl is gonna stay
This time the girl is gonna stay for more than just a day

I just can't help believin'
When she slips her hand in my hand
And it feels so small and helpless
That my fingers fold around it like a glove

And I just can't help believin'
When she's whisperin' her magic
And her tears are shinin' honey sweet with love

This time the girl is gonna stay (This time the girl is gonna stay)
This time the girl is gonna stay for more than just a day

For more than just a day

So kiss me and smile for me tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe I hate to go

There's so many times I've let you down so many times I've played around
I tell you now that they don't mean a thing

When I come back I'll wear your wedding ring
So kiss me and smile for me...

Eddy Arnold,"Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the morning
When through a sleepy haze I see her lying there
Soft as the rain that falls on summer flowers
Warm as the sunlight shining on her golden hair

When I awake I see her there so close beside me
I want to take her in my arms
The ache is there so deep inside me

Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the morning
Chasing the rainbow in her dreams so far away
And when she turns to touch me I kiss her face so softly
And then my Mary wakes to love another day

And Mary's there in summer days or stormy weather
She doesn't care, or right or wrong the love we share
We share together

Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the evening

And I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you again

Can you take good care of Jenny
Can you take her to school everyday
Can you teach her how to play
All the games that little girls play
Hear what I say
Can you teach her how to roll up her hair
Can you make sure each night that she says her prayers
Well if you can do all these things
Then maybe she won't miss me
Maybe she won't miss me

And tonight as you laid in that big lonely bed
And you look at that pillow 
Where I laid my head
With your heart on fire
Will you have no desire

Or to hold me

And if you can forget 
The good times we had

The love we share will always be, there'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light and make us realize all night it's over

When you walk away from me, there is no place to put my hand
Except to shade my eyes against the sun, that rises over land
I watch you walk away, somehow I have to let you go now it's over

If you knew just how I really feel, you might turn yet
There are so many times that people have to love and then forget
Though there might have been a way
I have to force myself to say it's over

So I turn my back and turn my collar to the wind
Move along in silence, trying not to think at all

Eddy Arnold,"I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend
",Loving Her Was Easier

Tells me the sun is going down

It wasn't me
That started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go
And do my patriotic chore
And yes, it's true that

Its hard to love a man 
Whose legs are bent and paralyzed
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age

But it won't be long I've heard them say until I not around

Older than the trees,
Younger than the mountains
Growing like a breeze.

Country roads, take me home
To the place where I belong:
West Virginia, mountain mom,
Take me home, country roads.

Miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky,
Misty taste of moonshine,
Teardrop in my eye.

Radio reminds me of my home far away 
And driving down the road I get a feeling
I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

Give her all your love and kiss my baby girl
Then you closed your eyes and went to sleep

And baby I will I promise I will
Every day that I'll live all the love I can give baby I will

And kiss you when I hold her on my knees

Sometimes you've hurt me deep inside
And you're so careless with my pride
But when you touch me the world is new
I was born to love you so what can I do

Sometimes you're distant and you're cold
And it's a stranger that I hold
But when you want me my dreams come true
I was born to love you so what can I do

No matter what I do I think about you
Those lonely hours when you're away

I couldn't make it for a day

I got to thinkin' it over how much I'd missed
So I got me a girl and I kissed her and then

Well I asked her to marry and be my sweet wife
I told her we'd be so happy for the rest of our life
I begged her and pleaded like a natural man
And then whups oh Lordy well she gave me her hand

Because she had kisses sweeter than wine...

Well we worked very hard both me and my wife
A working hand in hand to have a good life
We had corn in the fields and whaet in the bins
And then whups oh Lord I was the father of twins

Because she had kisses sweeter than wine...

Well our children then numbered just about four
And they all had the sweethearts a knockin' at the door
They all got married and they wouldn't hesitate
I was whups oh Lord the grandfather of eight

Because she had kisses sweeter than wine...

Well now that I'm old and ready to go
We get to thinkin' what happened a long time ago
Had a lotta kids a lotta trouble and pain
But then whups oh Lord we'd do it all again

In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons.

If the whole world stopped lovin' the way you stopped lovin' me
Have you ever stopped to wonder what kind of place this would be
If the whole world stopped lovin' the way you stopped lovin' me
If every heart was broken the way that you broke my own
And the whole world stopped lovin' how long would living go on
Hear the church bells in the steeple as they ring their song through the air
If the whole world stopped lovin' there'd be no steeple bells there
The tears would fill the river till the rivers flooded the sea

Addin' redskin arrows to the country's woes
Now Injun fightin' is somethin' he knows
So he shoulders his rifle and off he goes

Off through the woods he's a marchin' along
Makin' up yarns and a singin' a song
Itchin' for fightin' and rightin' a wrong

Till the Creeks was whipped an' peace was in store
An' while he was handlin' this risky chore
Made hisself a legend for evermore

The western march had just begun
So he packed his gear and his trusty gun
And lit out grinnin' to follow the sun

He heard of Houston and Austin so
To the Texas plains he just had to go
Where freedom was fightin' another foe
And they needed him at the Alamo

He's a devil not a man and he spreads the burning sand with water

Where the water's running free and it's waitin' there for me and you

The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star's a pool of water cool water
But with the dawn I'll wake and yawn
And carry on to water cool water

Just one thing more than water cool water

Twas a dirty little coward that shot Mr Howard
They laid Jesse James in his grave

I wonder how he does feel
For he ate of Jesse's bread and he slept in Jesse's bed
Then he laid Jesse James in his grave

It was his brother Frank that robbed the Gallatin bank
And carried the money from the town
It was in this very place that they had a little race
For they shot Captain Sheets to the ground

Jesse was a man a friend to the poor
He never would see a man suffer pain
And with his brother Frank he robbed the Chicago bank
And stopped the Glendale train

And carried the money from the town
It was in this very place that they had a little race
For they shot Captain Sheets to the ground

They went to the crossing not very far from there
And there they did the same
And the agent on his knees he delivered up the keys
To the outlaws Frank and Jesse James

Jesse had a wife to mourn all her life

It was on a Saturday night Jesse was at home
Talking to his family brave
When the thief and the coward a little Robert Ford
Laid Jesse James in his grave

How people held their breath when they heard of Jesse's death
And wondered how he ever came to die
Twas one of the gang dirty Robert Ford

Eddy Arnold,"The red headed stranger from Blue Rock Montana
Rode into town one day
And under his knees was a raging black stallion
And lopin' behind was a bay

The red headed stranger had eyes like the thunder
His lips that were sad and tight
His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside
His heart was heavy as night

Don't cross him, don't boss him, he's wild in his sorrow
He's ridin' and hidin' his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him, just wait till tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again

A yellow haired woman leaned out of her window
Watched as he passed her way
She drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion
But cast greedy eyes on the bay

But how could she know that this dancing bay pony
Meant more to him than life
For this was the horse his little lost darlin' was ridden
When she was his wife

The yellow haired lady came down to the tavern
Looked up the stranger there
He bought her a drink and he gave her some money
He just didn't seem to care

She followed him out as he saddled his stallion
And laughed as she grabbed at the bay
But he shot her so quick they had no time to warn her
She never heard anyone say

Don't cross him, don't boss him

They buried the yellow haired woman at sunset
The stranger went free of course
Cause you can't hang a man for shootin' a woman
Who's a tryin' to steal your horse

Don't cross him, don't boss him",The Red Headed Stranger
Eddy Arnold,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' thru the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves wuz made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered thru the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
with sweat,
They're ridin' hard to atch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Made me a slave to my wandering ways.

And I was born the next of kin

Just shovel on a little more coal
And when we cross that White Oak Mountain
You can watch old 97 roll

His whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle
Scalded to death by the steam

It was on this grade that he lost his air brakes

I used to think when you fell in love,
Bells rang and whistles blew
Like the fourth of July, but it was December
When I fell in love with you.
It happened like a snowfall
It came without a sound
And when I looked the world had changed
Everything was new.
I thought it was just snow fallin',
Softly comin' down.
But while I held you in my arms,
I was fallin', too.

The sky wasn't blue the very first time
I looked into your eyes.
It was heavy and gray, the middle of winter
So you took me by surprise.

Everything was new
I thought it was just snow fallin',
Softly comin' down.
But while I held you in my arms,

Eddy Arnold,"They say a man's home is his castle
He's like a king on a throne
It may be a shack down alongside the track

Don't rob another man's castle

Eddy Arnold,"It's a sin, my darling how I love you
Because I know our love can never be
It's a sin to keep this memory of you
When silence proves that you've forgotten me

The dream I built for us has tumbled
Each promise broken like my heart
It's a sin, my darling how I love you
So much in love and yet so far apart

It's a sin to hide behind this heartache
To make believe that I've found someone new
It's a sin to say that I don't miss you
When people know I'm still in love with you

I'm sure you're happy with another
Who shares the love I couldn't win
Why pretend that I can't live without you
When deep inside I know that it's a sin",It's a Sin
Eddy Arnold,"Your baby loves you now so don't make her blue now
You'd better start bein' true now I'm telling you why

Because if you break her heart somebody's gonna come along
And he'll steal her away from you somebody like me

Let me tell you friend I'm not botherin'
But I think it's such a sin if you don't treat her right

Because if you break her heart

She wants to be held tight now each and every night now
You'd better treat her right now I'm telling you why

Because if you break her heart

I hope you listen to now each word that I've told you now
These things you'd better do now or you will live alone

Because if you break her heart
Will steal her away somebody like me",Somebody Like Me
Eddy Arnold,"AWAY IN A MANGER
Writer W.J. Kirkpatrick

Away in a manger, no crib for His bed, The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head, The stars in the sky looked down where He lay, The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay. The cattle are lowing, the poor Babe awakes, But little Lord Jesus no crying He makes, I love, Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky And stay by my cradle 'til morning is nigh. Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay Close by me forever and ever I pray. Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care And lead us to heaven to live with Thee there.

Nor thorns infest the ground.

There were no presents, there was no tree
From the sky there came a gloom

No shopping malls, no flashing lights
Just one big star to fill the night

Eddy Arnold,"And now the end is near and so I face the final curtain
My friend I'll say it clear I'll state my case of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full I've traveled each and every highway
And more much more than this I did it my way

Regrets I've had a few but then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption
I planned each chartered course each careful step along the byway
And more much more than this I did it my way

Yes there were times I'm sure you knew when I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way

I've loved I've laughed and cried I've had my fill my share of losing
And now as tears subside I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that and may I say not in a shy way
Oh no oh no not me I did it my way

For what is a man what has he got if not himself then he has not
To say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows and did it my way
And did it my way




",My Way
Eddy Arnold,"It's not the pale moon that excites me 
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 
It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

To hold you ever so tight 

And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You
Eddy Arnold,"Smile though your heart is aching smile even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky you'll get by
If you smile through your fear and sorrow smile and maybe tomorrow

Light up your face with gladness hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near

Eddy Arnold,"It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

It's knowing I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bons
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks
And I'd be planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking

It's knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
You're movin' on the back roads by the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junk yards and the highways come between us
And some other woman crying to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still run in silence, tears of joy stain my face
And a summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walking on the back roads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind
",Gentle on My Mind
Eddy Arnold,"And I wake up in the mornin'
With my hair down in my eyes and she says, ""Hi""
And I stumble to the breakfast table
While the kids are goin' off to school, goodbye

Says, ""How you feelin', hon?""
And I look across at smilin' lips
That warm my heart and see my morning sun

There's no such thing as Doctor Seuss
Disneyland and Mother Goose is no nursery rhyme

God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when myself is feelin' low
I think about her face aglow to ease my mind

Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy
And ask her if she could get away and meet me
And grab a bite to eat

And she drops what she's doing
And hurries down to meet me and I'm always late
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me
Cause she's made that way

And if that's not lovin' me then all I've got to say

Writer Tommy Dilbeck

I asked a little boy to call his daddy He said he couldn't and sighed And when I asked him what was wrong Here's what the little boy replied. My Daddy is only a picture, In a frame that hangs on the wall Each day I talk to my daddy, But he never talks at all. I tell him all of my secrets And all of my little plans And from the way he smiles at me, I know he understands. The angels took Daddy to heaven, When I was just goin' on three But I'll bet they never told him How blue and lonesome we'd be. I try to cheer up my mommie, When the tears roll down her face My daddy is only a picture, But I'm tryin' to take his place.

Eddy Arnold,"I'm hearing funny stories and they're far from being true
But you know how talk gets around
Those busy tongues are wagging saying I walked out on you
But you know how talk gets around

I must admit our romance wasn't all that it should be
We tried to claim a love we'd never found
They say you're living reckless and they're blaming it on me
But you know how talk gets around

I hear you're glad we parted that you're saying you don't care
Now you know how talk gets around
They're telling everybody that I didn't treat you fair
And you know how talk gets around

For some lonely girl in a one room world whose tears won't let her rest

As she clutches her pillow so tight

It's three a.m. in New York City but the wino he doesn't know
His bottle is empty his pockets are empty and where did his pals all go
He shared with them and he cared for them
For a while everything was all right
Now he's one of those lonely people in the night

Just take what they may give you and give but what you can

Eddy Arnold,"See the tree how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long, it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted, it was just a twig

And then the first snow came
And she ran out to brush the snow away so it wouldn't die
Came running in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself, I laughed till I cried

She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so
And I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago

And it would sure embarrass her
When I came home from working late 'cause I would know
That she'd been there a crying
Over some sad and silly late, late show

And honey, I miss you
And I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

She wrecked the car and she was sad
So afraid that I'd be mad but what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me and hugged my neck

I came home unexpectedly
Found her crying needlessly in the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and Robins sing, she went away

And honey, I miss you
And I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

Yes, one day while I was not at home
While she was there and all alone the angels came
Now all I have is memories
Of honey and I wake up nights and call her name

And now my life's an empty stage
Where honey lived and honey played and love grew up
A small cloud passes overhead
And cries down on the flower bed that honey loved

Yes, see the tree how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long, it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted, it was just a twig

And honey, I miss you
And I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

Eddy Arnold,"It's hung there on the front porch
Since this old house was built
It's where the old men whittle
And the women fleece their quilts
It's held four generations
Through whatever life could bring
That ol' swing
That ol' porch swing
It held a grieving widow
When my daddy's daddy died
And now it rocks my children
When they close their sleepy eyes
It's where I popped the question
With a quarter karat ring
That ol' swing
That ol' porch swing

It's been there through the sunshine
It's had it's share of rain
Been a witness to some good times
And a like amount of pain
If it could tell it's story
What a violin could sing
That ol' swing
That ol' porch swing

It's where brother read the letter
That sent him off to war
We knew he had to go and fight
But we didn't know what for
When he came home he just sat there
And never said a thing
In that swing
That ol' porch swing

It's been there through the sunshine
It's had it's share of rain
Been a witness to some good times
And a like amount of pain

Eddy Arnold,"I could have a mansion
That is higher than the trees
I could have all the gifts I want
And never ask please

I could fly to Paris
[?] at my beck and call
Why do I go through life
With nothing at all

But when I dream
I dream of you
Maybe someday
You will come true

I can be the singer
Or the clown in every room
I can even call someone
Take me to the moon

I can put my makeup on
And drive the men insane
I can go to bed alone
And never know his name

I dream of you

Eddy Arnold,"Call her your sweetheart whenever she feels blue
You know there's not a thing she wouldn't do for you
And when you are tempted to wander astray
Remember there are times she feels the very same way

Let her know that she means more than all the world to you
You'll find the future holds a treasure worth much more than gold
If you'll only call her your sweetheart

Eddy Arnold,"Sitting alone in an old rockin' chair
I saw an old mother with silvery hair
She seemed so neglected by those who should care
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair
Her hands were calloused and wrinkled and old
A life of hard work was the story they told
And I've thought of angels as I saw her there
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair

Bless her old heart do you think she'd complain
Though life has been bitter she'd live it again
And carry the cross that is more than her share
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair
It wouldn't take much to gladden her heart
Just some small remembrance on somebody's part
A letter would brighten her empty life there
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair

I know some kids in an orphan's home
Who think they owned heaven if she was their own
They'd never be willing to let her sit there
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair
I look at her and I think what a shame
The ones who forgot her she loves just the same
And I think of angels as I see her there

I lost my true lover for courtin' too slow
Oh courtin's a pleasure parting is grief
And a false hearted lover is worse than a thief

A thief will just rob you take all that you have
But false hearted lovers take you to your grave
The grave will decay you turn you into dust
And it just isn't one girl a poor boy can trust

Don't place your affection on a green willow tree

If in the dusk of the twilight dimmed be the region afar

Um-pah! Um-pah! Um-pah-pah-pah!'
Oh what fun a wonderful time
Finding love for only a dime.
Oh, the Merry-Go-Round broke down

Things turned out fine and now she's mine

Eddy Duchin,"Moon over Miami
Shine on my love and me
So we can stroll beside the roll
Of the rolling sea

Moon over Miami
Shine on as we begin
A dream or two that may come true
When the tide comes in

Hark to the song of the smiling troubadours
Hark to the throbbing guitars
Hear how the waves offer thunderous applause
After each song to the stars

Moon over Miami
You know we're waiting for
A little love, a little kiss
On Miami shore",Moon over Miami
Eddy Duchin,"Live was as calm as a summer sea
When silver moonlight beams
And then a new love beckoned me
Wrecking the ship of my dreams
 
Riptide caught in a riptide, torn between two loves
The old and the new
Riptide lost in a riptide
Where will it take me what shall I do?
My heart is tossed on a sea of emotion
One love offers romance
The other devotion
A new love is calling
The old love is pleading
I'm caught in a riptide what shall I do?

Eddy Duchin,"Bluebird you sing of happiness
Swinging in a blossom laden tree
But tell me bluebird
Will there be happiness for me?

Will I discover Someone to care for me?
A perfect lover to hold me tenderly?
Will someone ever sing me A love song while we dance?
Will the music bring me romance?

Will there be someone Whenever skies are gray
To kiss my lonely tears away?
And will that someone be all I dreamed my love would be
Someone to care for me?

Eddy Duchin,"You're just too marvelous, too marvelous for words

Eddy Duchin,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment

Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves
Eddy Louiss,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan
Eddy Louiss,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues
Eddy Louiss,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you
",I'm Getting Sentimental over You [Instrumental]
Eddy Louiss,"Some sunny day, baby 
When everything seems OK, baby 
You'll wake up and find that you're alone 
'Cause I'll be gone 
Gone, gone, gone, really gone, gone, gone, gone 
'Cause you done me wrong 

Everyone that you meet, baby 
As you walk down the street, baby 
Will ask you why you're walkin' all alone 
Why you're on your own 
Just say I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, really gone 
'Cause you done me wrong 

If you change your ways, baby 
You might get me to stay, baby 
You better hurry up if you don't wanna be alone 
'Cause I'll be gone

'Cause you done me wrong","Gone, Gone, Gone!"

Eddy Mitchell,"My mind is clearer now
At last
All too well
I can see
Where we all
Soon will be
If you strip away
The myth
From the man
You will see
Where we all
Soon will be

Jesus
You've started to believe
The things they say of you
You really do believe
This talk of God is true

And all the good you've done
Will soon be swept away
You've begun to matter more
Than the things you say

Listen Jesus
I don't like what I see
All I ask is that you listen to me
And remember
I've been your right hand man all along
You have set them all on fire
They think they've found the new Messiah
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong

I remember when this whole thing began
No talk of God then, we called you a man
And believe me
My admiration for you hasn't died
But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied

Nazareth's most famous son
Should have stayed a great unknown
Like his father carving wood
He'd have made good
Tables, chairs and oaken chests
Would have suited Jesus best
He'd have caused nobody harm
No one alarm

Listen Jesus, do you care for your race?
Don't you see we must keep in our place?
We are occupied
Have you forgotten how put down we are?
I am frightened by the crowd
For we are getting much too loud
And they'll crush us if we go too far
If we go too far

Listen Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour
All your followers are blind
Too much heaven on their minds
It was beautiful, but now it's sour
Yes it's all gone sour
Ah ah ah ah ah
God Jesus, it's all gone sour

Listen Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live
So come on, come on, listen to me
Ah ah
Come on, listen, listen to me
Come on and listen to me
Ah ah",La  Chanson de Judas

But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore

It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed
And the wants and needs of a woman your age really I realize
But it won't be long, I've heard them say, until I'm not around
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

She's leaving now cause I just heard the slamming of the door

Au bar il commande deux whiskies
Le chien refuse, l'homme se sacrifie

Faites-moi taire si je mens, mais laissez-moi le temps
De vous parler d'un bar où il se passe des tas de choses
Car un soir sur le tard, un kangourou est venu boire

L'animal paya et sortit
On ne le revit plus car l'homme
Vendait trop cher son rhum

Mais je gagne beaucoup surtout à être connu
Je suis parti de rien mais j'attends toujours une chose
Si vous voulez me joindre, soyez les bienvenus

Sans toi, je n'suis pas mieux

Affûtées dans tes yeux
T'es déjà passée sur mon corps
Et mon coeur handicapé
Mais tu reviens sur tous mes torts
Oh ! me laisse pas tomber

De nous deux qui est l'plus lâche
Lui, muet, moi qu'entends rien ?
Comme ça, j'ai pas d'états d'âme
J'dors, calme et serein
Je fais pas l'sac des vieilles dames
J'braque pas les vieux dans les trains

Et ça me fait penser aux trois singes
Qui refusent de parler, qui s'taisent comme des images
Et s'comportent comme des humains

Et ça me fait penser aux trois singes
Qui se ferment les yeux, se cachent le visage
Et s'comportent comme des humains
Il leur manque que la parole
Bah ! Qu'ils la prennent
Moi, j'n'en fais rien
Animal moi j'n'ai pas cette carapace
Animal qui t'protège du bien comme du mal
Je traverse la vie, l'espace
Sans m'occuper d'mon prochain
Et j'efface toute trace
Qui m'indiquerait mon chemin
Je ne veux d'mal à personne
La délation, c'est pas bien
Une balance c'est pas un homme
J'suis surtout pas un témoin


Et ça me fait penser aux trois singes

En clair, faudrait qu'je t'aime

Eddy Mitchell,"Le bris de glace d'un coup de cristal est crispant
Mais demeure élégant
Le cri du bar qui ferme est déchirant
Tout comme un son dolby surround
Quelle que soit la ville, le lieu, l'endroit ou l'heure
Y'a toujours l'instant où y'a un blues qui pleure
Pourquoi les gens qui s'aiment aiment s'faire du mal
Meme à titre expérimental ?
Les larmes sont peut-etre plus salées
Dans les yeux des amours blessés
Quelle que soit la nuit, le p'tit jour est là à l'heure
Les brèves de comptoir s'terminent sur des rancoeurs

Considérés comm' des mutants ?

Là où les autres font semblant
Quelles que soient leurs vies, le meilleur est ailleurs

Comme quoi parti de pas grand chose, on peut arriver à rien.  

J'téléphone, je n'faxe pas
J'cherche pas mes mots, je n'écris pas
J'ai perdu l'sens de la grammaire
J'suis r'tourné à l'ère primaire
Mes pensées sont banales
Enrichissantes, certes, mais vénales
""Golden Boy"" j'suis dans les affaires
J'côtoie les grands de cette terre
En amour là j'suis mal
J'dévalue, j'gagne pas à l'oral
La bourse de Tokyo vers minuit
Neuf heures de New York, c'est quinze heures à Paris
Ça m'laisse pas l'temps d't'aimer
""Golden Boy"" pas le temps de rêver
C'qui est compatible dans la vie
C'est qu'les gens qui s'aiment s'retrouvent dans l'même lit

Déjà p'tit, à l'école
J'faisais dans l'trafic de chewing-gums
Coco-Boer et Tutti Frutti
Contre un d'voir, j'gonflais les prix
Tête dans l'ordinateur
J'suis d'venu myope boursicoteur
Puis un ""raider"" m'a tout appris
Tout sauf le sens de la vie
""Golden Boy"", ça doit faire
Les p'tits déj's, les repas d'affaires
Délits d'initiés le midi
O. P. A. le soir, cocktails l'après-midi
Sortir tard les clients

Surtout pour un couple, c'est l'enfer garanti.",Golden Boy
Eddy Mitchell,"J'aime pas les gens qui sont toujours heureux
L'bonheur suprême, ça me paraît douteux
L'trop plein d'amour, ça déborde puis ça lasse
Ça se joue à deux jusqu'à temps que ça s'casse
Si pour Karl Marx la religion c'est l'opium
Adam et Ève alors c'est quoi ? C'est des pommes ?
Roméo, Juliette, Paul et Virginie
Sont aussi tartes que Frankie et Johnnie

Moi…
J'aime pas les gens heureux
Faut toujours qu'ils s'aiment
Il n'y en a que pour eux
C'est toujours les mêmes
Ils sont partout chez eux
L'amour ça rend zen
J'aime pas les gens heureux
J'suis jaloux, y m'gênent
Ils sont seuls au monde just' elle et lui
Hypnotisés, se déplacent comme des zombies
J'suis transparent pour eux, j'suis pas d'ici
Si elle partait, elle le ferait pleurer
Encore faut-il qu'elle veuill' bien s'en aller
Si l'un des deux devait quitter la vie
Inconsolable, elle porterait le deuil jour et nuit
J'aime pas les gens qu'ont d'l'amour dans les yeux
Faut les prév'nir, où on f'ra des malheureux
Ça se soigne pas mais parfois ça guérit
Restent les souv'nirs qui vous collent à la vie

Mais l'présent est incertain
J'oublie les visages et les noms peu mémorables
Mais s'ils changent qui s'en souvient ?
Y'a qu'Dieu qui r'connaît les siens
La peur c'est un monde qui s'réveille tous les matins
Les religions s'en servent bien
Les animaux grondent juste pour faire les malins
Effrayer le genre humain
C'est l'safari quotidien

Pour l'attaque, pour tuer
Mais pas d'chat policier
Y'a des chiens engagés
Enrôlés dans l'armée
Et qu'on envoie dans l'espace
Mais jamais de chat de chasse
Maou, maou, maou

Est-ce que l'homme est bon ? À manger, c'est pas certain
Faut vraiment qu'il n'y ait plus rien
Les nuits de plein' lune les loups-garous font festin
L'amour, c'est pour les félins
Paraît qu'Dieu reconnaît les siens

C'est la plus belle de tout l' quartier
Et mon plus grand désir c'est d' lui parler
Elle aguiche mes amis, même les plus petits

Pourtant pour elle j' n'ai pas l'impression d'exister
Mais tout ceci ne m'empêche pas de penser
""Cette fille-là, mon vieux
Elle est terrible""

Hé, regarde un peu, cette voiture
On la dirait vraiment faite pour moi
Et il doit faire bon rouler avec ça
Hélas, lorsque je pense au prix de l'essence

Je perds subitement l'envie de m' la payer
Mais tout ceci ne m'empêche pas de penser
""Cette voiture-là, mon vieux
Elle est terrible""

Attends un peu que je travaille
Quand je pourrai me la payer comptant
J'inviterai la belle fille à monter dedans
La capote baissée sans trop nous presser

Nous descendrons les Champs-Elysées
Et les copains nous voyant passer diront médusés
""Y a pas à dire, ce gars-là
Il est terrible""

C'est beau de rouler en rêvant
Voilà que j'arrête ma vieille citron
Et j'ai bonne mine devant la belle maison
De celle que j'aime, les poches à plat

Pourtant si elle m'embrassait rien qu'une fois
Je dirais certainement en parlant de moi
""Y a pas à dire, ce gars-là
Il est terribl""

Eddy Mitchell,"À l'école quand j'étais petit
Les grands se cachaient sous leur lit
Pour fumer en cachette une cigarette
Ils se faufilaient
Sans un bruit
À la faveur de la nuit
Certains d'entre eux fumaient dans les toilettes
Le privilège qu'ils m'accordaient
C'est moi, le petit, qui craquait
Une allumette pour leur cigarette

Fume, fume, fume cette cigarette
Fume, fume, fume, fume cette cigarette
Et j'entends leur voix me dire
Elle revient en souvenir
Pour devenir un homme
Fume cette cigarette

La surveillante des cours du soir
M'a entraîné dans le parloir
Je n'ai pas l'impression d'être à la fête
Elle dit qu'il faut me rattraper
Qu' j'ai besoin d cours particuliers
Qu'elle a toujours maté les fortes têtes
Elle m'a reçu dans son peignoir
M'a demandé si j' voulais boire
Et tendu un paquet de cigarettes

Fume, fume, fume cette cigarette
Fume, fume, fume, fume cette cigarette
Et j'entends sa voix me dire
Elles reviennent en souvenir
Pour devenir un homme
Fume cette cigarette
Mais j'ai vraiment fumé plus tard
Lorsque j'ai vu Humphrey Bogart
Pincer entre ses lèvres une cigarette
Identifié à ce héros
Je marchais en courbant le dos
Je me prenais pour un roi du racket
Je n'ai connu que des déboires
Je rentrais en toussant le soir
Sans la moindre féminine conquête

Fume, fume, fume cette cigarette
Fume, fume, fume, fume cette cigarette
Et j'entends des voix me dire
Elles reviennent en souvenir
Pour devenir un homme
Fume cette cigarette

Il m'arrive souvent de fumer
Des choses plus ou moins bien roulées
Qui n' ressemblent pas toujours aux cigarettes
Je n'ai rien compris et rien vu
Mais un homme je suis devenu
Accroché pour toujours aux cigarettes

Fume, fume, fume cette cigarette
Fume, fume, fume, fume cette cigarette
Et j'entends des voix me dire
Elles reviennent en souvenir
Pour devenir un homme

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Until I first met you, I was lonesome
And when you came in sight, dear, my heart grew light
And this old world seemed new to me

You're really swell, I have to admit you
Deserve expressions that really fit you
And so I've racked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me

Bei mir bist do schon, please let me explain
Bei mir bist do schon means you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the land

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

I've tried to explain, bei mir bist do schon
So kiss me and say you understand

Bei mir bist do schon, you've heard it all before
 but let me try to explain
Bei mir bist do schon means that you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, it's such an old refrain
 and yet I should explain
It means I am begging for your hand

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""

The Lord is the stronghold of my life.
Whom shall I fear? Whom shall I fear?

When men advance against me
And all my foes surround me,
They will stumble and fall, stumble and fall.
Though all the world besiege me,
And war break out against me,
I am sure in the Lord, sure in the Lord.

And in the day of trouble,
I'm safe within His dwelling,
He will hide me, He will hide me.
My head will be exalted
So far above my enemies,
I will sing to the Lord, sing to the Lord.

There is one thing that I ask of the Lord
For the days of my life;
That I may dwell in the house of the Lord
All the days of my life.

Through your love and through the ram,
You saved the son of Abraham;
Through the power of your hand,
Turned the sea into dry land.
To the outcast on her knees,
You were the God who really sees,

You set your children free.

Through the years you've made it clear,

Though your word contained the plan,

Eden's Curse,"They hide away in the darkness after midnight
Now they?re forbidden and they look in from the outside

When they failed to pass his test
Temptation got the better of them
They will suffer for their quest
Forever after be condemned

They lost their innocence that day
When they sealed mankind?s fate
There?s a price that we will all pay for eternity
Nobody can save us

Betrayed our father
Brother seeks brother
We set the tone and our offspring did worse
So heaven help us, they?ve fallen under Eden?s Curse

His brother?s blood he wipes off from his own knife
And he shall pay through this one and the next life

When they failed to pass his test
Temptation got the better of them
They will suffer for their quest
Forever after be condemned

They lost their innocence that day
When they sealed mankind?s fate
There?s a price that we will all pay for eternity
Nobody can save us

Betrayed our father

We set the tone and our offspring did worse
So heaven help us, they?ve fallen under Eden?s Curse

We set the tone and our offspring did worse
So heaven help us, they?ve fallen under Eden?s Curse

Eden-Stell Guitar Duo,"Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Edenbridge,"Out in the prairie the bison dared to roam
The crying of a lone shot claimed they're forever gone
High in the breezing winds an eagle dared to fly
For the white man's sake the covenant was just a lie

Out in the flowing streams the beaver dared to build
The never ending ignorance the paleface's guilt
A single tent was left lonesome in the woods
When the cannons spoke the words
Murderers took off the hoods

[Chorus]

For all times rise
Cheyenne spirit rise
By the grace of all your wisdom
In the hunting grounds it flies
Chase the track and ride free
Eternal unity
Let the flutes play for a last time
Ban the white man's tyranny

And they came riding with their hate
And marching with their greed
External territories
Served their senseless need
But they stood tall in their own fate
They knew their bloody way
Along the line of fire
Into the grand decay

Edenbridge,"In my darkest hour I pray
For a life seemed gone astray
See a flower grow

In a never ending night
Far away a colored light
I can see a rainbow rise

I could believe
In the love I found so long
You're the air that I breathe
Let us dream a dream
Forever shine on
In the heaven of delight
Where love will shine a light
Let your beauty flow
Forever shine on

In the distance I behold
Existing seems so cold
I hear an angel sing

In the evening glow I seek
For a glimmering mountain's peak
Imagining I was free

Like a candle in the wind
We are fragile and we suffer
From within our deepest hearts
Let the wind breeze through your hair
And let your spirit fly
Forever shine on

Edenbridge,"I remember a past life, a life long ago
Memories are reveries
And visions fading into grey

I behold the paleness with the glimpse of an eye
There's no friend in no man's land
Streets leading to wild frontiers

[Pre-Chorus]

Let the torchlight shine above you
Scan a flashlight of a dream
Take the spell and hold the spirit of the flame
And rise up with the light

[Chorus]

Holy fire glimmering eve
Follow traces until you believe
Light a candle for the magical ring
And wait until the night's breaking in

Am I walking the false path the one of no return
Counting strides the mind divides
The ever-turning wheel of time

Then I'm crossing the border beyond the no man's land
Lizard eyes and painted skies
The turning point right on my way

[Chorus]",Holy Fire
Edenbridge,"I'm walking along the river
Raindrops fall from the sky
The eagle above never wonders
'bout all the feelings gone by

The flower buds open their hearts
They're begging for water to fall
As they're starting to fill up my senses
I recognize them all

[Chorus]

Falling far beyond the horizon
Falling in my and your lane
Falling in fear as the ground comes near
They're falling in the rain
They're falling in the rain

Throstle in the tree can you hear me
Let me hear singing your tune
Stars in the sky let me be part
When we take a dance with the moon

Butterfly open your wings
Woodpecker answer my call
Walking in midst the silence
Where I hear the raindrops fall

In silence they roam in the grass
In silence they drop on a stone
In masses they fall from heaven above
But when they fall they die alone

And with the coming night I hear 'em cry

From the fear they were overrun
From the hurricane they were spun
The candle has lost its flame
'cause they play the final game

Out from the dust they danced apart from all
All warnings overheard until they call

The storm has turned the tides
All is changing from left to right
The gloom it came over them
Again and again

[Chorus]

As we stand here in vain we're awaiting soon
The falling twilight of midnight at noon
There's no sun to see there's only one moon
'cause it's midnight at noon

The sun has set beyond the western sky
And with the coming night I hear 'em cry

From the hurricane they were spun

Edenbridge,"The edge of the abyss where the journeys end
Visible crossroads where mortal lives will bend
The moment of truth, the calm before the storm
The camouflage of liars abruptly will be torn

At the end of the tunnel I'm awaiting the truth
Through the misty twilight perhaps eternal youth
Do I feel the pale void, do I feel the seventh sky?
When life runs like a movie as the time goes by

[Chorus]

Do I fly, do I cry, do I see the light?
In blinding colors does it shine so bright
Can I flee, can I see, can I be something new?
When the clock strikes the hour I'm transcending into

Heading for a new land beyond the fading sun
Thoughts dwell in my mind the journey has begun
The vision it seems so clear but does it pretend?
Travelling souls in riot, the beginning or the end?

The howling of the sirens I don't hear 'em no more
Walls of fears been torn if we knew why thunders roar
Dancing the dance at the carnival of dreams
The aim of restless travellers is where the beacon beams

[Chorus]

And here I am walking in silence, making my steps beyond
Beyond the afterglow in a constant flow of light
The rainbow seems so near, finally I am here

The guardian angels they're calling my name
An astral dream in the sky?
They're dancing at the carnival of souls
They dance into the light into eternal light
I'm singing the tune in unison with angels
In the key of lordian harmony
The journey has an end
I'm waiting in command
Never to contend ... in the end",My Last Step Beyond
Edenbridge,"Along the banks of astral silence
The Honey Rivers flow
Time seems standing still before my eyes

The velvet sound of the ocean waves
White sand underneath
In the land of eternity

The old bridge tells a story
Of long gone centuries
And the gardens of a king far away

The palms around they whisper
The sacred holy rhymes
To keep legends alive

Endless the night awaiting the morning
Awakened by a dream
The moon touches the sky
While the light catches my eye I'm beholding
The stars seem to shine more intensive than ever
Enlighting the path in the dark
And then the horizon is visible for me
I'm breathing

[Chorus]

The heartbeat of the paradise to feel
Sunrise in Eden
And Aurora greets the day
Wishing afterglow away
To let the magic kingdom shine in light
An endless flow in Elysian Fields

And I'm holding on once more
To the moments I long for
To the ageless beauty of a world that sleeps",Sunrise in Eden
Edenbridge,"Seems I was sleeping for one thousand years
The wheel of time has turned into the age of tears
How long I am in there I cannot tell for sure
But the flower starts to fade she has to endure

Take me back from beyond the horizon
For a little while
Let me feel the idea of a sun dance
I will hold my head up high
Just before leaving
Like a raindrop in the sun
Could I believe that I am one

Was it a wonder or a present from above
How should know if I will ever laugh
But time is unyielding it's never standing still
To control the forces that are breaking down my will

On top of the mountains one touch in the sky

Lifting shadows of the past

Their eyes full of regrets

I am waiting for a sign

Myself from space and time

The key that may unlock the chain

And someone speaks my name from far away

I will reach for the sources of light
As we are all finding our new hemisphere
I am turning just yearning to feel
Feel your dreams, don't toss them away

Ancient myth arcana, Elysian seas of time
The stones of wisdom shine again, the moonlight hides the rhyme
In long gone days of yore, one thousand years before

Here I can feel the inner flame
Could forget what we became
And the false mirages can't deceive, deceive me no more

I am facing countless shadows in despair
But I won't follow them into the gloomy calm aside of light

[Chorus]

Thorns of roses that I feel, secrecy under the seal
Hear the tolling of the bell, bring me under your spell

See the mysteries in twilight they're turning away
From darkness to light (into infinity)

Here where the dreams of Eden's near
Leaving to a distant sphere
To Elysian seas of time we ride
I am longing for infinity

Far beyond the open gate
To the secret places never seen before
For this final odyssey into

",Ascending
Edenbridge,"I believe in the secret path that's hiding from 
Our eyes,the night-time skies 
Are weaving a web of haze 
Golden shores are so far away from silver dreams 
Arcades cast platinum shades 
Way back to the early days 

Here 
The stardust angel spreads his wings and rides the winds of time 
Touched by the moonlight's sonant symphony 
 
Color my sky 
Forsaken am I 
From out of the shadows 
There's a light to rely 
Unbrocken wings 
The rising of kings 
To a new age we're waiting 
For the dawning of springs 

I believe in calling spirits of the trees 
Per chance, we're staying in trance 
We summon the coming age 
Listening to the tunes of whales and dolphins here 
Our seams, mistreated and squeezed 
Will turn into furious rage

Just follow into the light
And what if your whole world stays behind
It's robbing you of your sight

Look behind the charading games they played

Take those chains here away from me
Don't pour some oil into the fire
Shake off the past and you will agree
Will-o'-the wisps they will be never leading me

Don't dream of life just live your dream
And use the power of believing
I am eternal, into the light I ride
Into the cosmic force beyond the other side
I am a traveler in time
And I will find my way back into
My way back into the light
Right into the light I ride

Within a velvety reverie
As far as eyes can see

the vesper bell's tolling
From the belfry up near
The ring of truth I try to hear
Shooting a glance at the wild sea
Land will be rising at view

to take the line of least resist
Will slow and sure deceive
The deadlock of this waiting game
The feelings you relieve

[chorus]

losing all the narrow bounds in me
As far as eyes can see





",As Far as Eyes Can See
Edenbridge,"[intro-chorus]
See visionary eye
The deadend fire coming from the sky
Flamboyant signs of imminent times

on mazarine seas the ship sails near to the wind
By sagging spirits the hopes were pinned
To rock in the ropes of sand

denying the peril, pride goes before a fall
Picking its way to the port of call
Apparent horizons to strand

[chorus]
See visionary eye
The deadend fire coming from the sky
Flamboyant signs of imminent times
Skyward I stare
In the streak of the lightning
Into st. elmo's fire
The deadend fire
Into st. elmo's fire

with mounting suspense, waiting for augury
Visions are blending upon the sea
Dimming and fading away

into the wind's eye to terra incognita
The clouds are releasing a shining star
Until the kiss-off the way

[chorus]

in the afterglow here in the peacock blue
The signs will all be inside you

",Deadend Fire
Edenbridge,"We're hunting open secrets
We're searching high and low
Intrepid we might be we'll never know
Under a press of canvas
We're on the parting of the ways
We lost the trace

we're gathering life's roses
We're in a quandary
But on the sly we never can't be free
We face the stormy petrel
And beg for wings to fly away
Forever away

[chorus]
Will all be there
At farpoint anywhere
My visions leading me that far
Could we foresee
Then we would turn the key
Dimensions open who we are

our mascots left us lonely
Inmidst our palisade
This ragged garden shows what we have made
We cut the old alliance
We skipped off from our legacy
How could we

Your pounding heartbeat slows
The space age has begun beyond recall

",Farpoint Anywhere
Edenbridge,"An outcast of victorian society
A crying jag since long-gone childhood days
The dream to be an albatross
With alabaster wings
To be flying
Before the last bell rings

The crushing arms of loneliness embracing still
The sear and yellow leaf is drawing near
This jaded heart escaping from the shadowplay
What is the measure of a man ?
And the price that we all pay

The final curtain falls
None of the orchestra will play
The stageplay life will hold
The freakshow at the fair
Is there a straw in bursting dalles
Will someone care?

The looking glass, deceiver of reality
The try of make-believe in who we are
And the hiding in the mists of night will never end
But a graceful heart prevails
And the meaning of a friend

None of the orchestra will play

Was it a waking dream in me ?
The spiral staircase led to places so unknown

and out of a clear sky falling
I'm searching high and low for hold
Right on the brink of ruin

If I could hear your calls
Reflected to the nines
Revealing precious memories
The whispering gallery
The place of mystery
In echoes from a silent sea

and there the shadows danced
Before I heard the clarion call
In their centennial desperation I won't fall

shaken to their foundations
A mereghost of their former selves
Well nigh they've gone to glory

Will it be my guiding star
On the floatbridge to forever
I can go on so far
This alluring jack o' lantern
And the relics of the past
Leading on to your decay
The pendulum swings so fast

On the flare path of your magnificient

A rock in the surf we've been living for
A line in the sand, the future in hand by a dream

and when the whole world's glided
Through our hands misguided
An ordeal by fire, a dance on a wire without end

While the clock ticks on and on

And the guardians of time will stand by
And praise your tale

The battle to win

Will come to deceive
Before the well of life runs dry

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

I couldn't stop movin' when it first took hold
It was a warm spring night at the old town hall
There was a group called 'The Jokers', they were layin' it down
Doncha know I'm never gonna lose that funky sound?

Edgar Winter,"I thought she noticed me when I saw her
She seemed to check me out right away
So I 
Asked her name
I played the old game
Her reception seemed to be ok
She was a cute little thing about fifteen
And she liked to make the schoolboys stare
It was an instant cosmic need
A Teenage Love Affair
It was getting hotter minute by minute
As each second brought her closer to me
And then we 
Finally touched and
We touched and we touched
And her hands felt their way over me
So we made love there in the daytime
When her mama left, we went upstairs
It was a total cosmic deed
A Teenage Love Affair
Teenage love affair,
A teenage love affair
Teenage love affair,
A teenage love affair
Teenage love affair,
A teenage love affair
Teenage love affair,

Then I heard a strange rumor about her
And i didn't know just what to say
It really 
Brought me down
You know it turned me around
Cause no girl had ever done me that way
But it didn't take long til I found out
That there's a lotta sexy girls out there
And I've got a built-in cosmic need

Edgar Winter,"You know I've heard it said there's beauty in distortion
By some people who've withdrawn to find their heads
Now they say that there is humor in misfortune
You know I wonder if they'll laugh when I am dead

Why am I fighting to live if I 'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

Hey, you know some people say that values are subjective,
But they're just speaking words that someone else has said.
And so they live and fight and kill with no objective
Sometimes it's hard to tell the living from the dead

Why am I fighting to live if I 'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

Yeah, you know I used to weave my words into confusion
And so I hope you'll understand me when I 'm through
You know I used to live my life as an illusion,
But reality will make my dreams come true

So I'll keep fighting to live till there's no reason to fight
And I'll keep trying to see until the end is in sight
You know I'm trying to give so see'mon give me a try

Ever since the first day
That I met you
I knew that I could not forget you

And though all your friends said
You are no good for me
All they had to give
Was their sympathy

They say I'm not the man
That I used to be
I guess that's the way
That it had to be

'Cause you were my light
My wrong and my right
You were my sight
My day and my night

You are the one who took the time
To understand
Showed me what it was
To be your man

And lord knows if I hurt you
I hope you understood
That I was just trying to do
What I thought was good

You say I'm not the man
That I used to be
I guess that's the way
That it had to be

You were my light
My wrong and my right
You were my sight
My day and my night

Now that your memory
Begins to fade
I can't help a crying
Bout the games we played

And though I never, never
See your face again
No I feel the same

Then he said, ""Yes, I think it can be easily done 
Just take everything down to Highway 61"" 

Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night 
Told the first father that things weren't right 
""My complexion,"" she says, ""is much too white""

He said, ""Hmm, you're right, let me tell the second mother this has been done"" 
But the second mother was with the seventh son 
And they were both out on Highway 61

to begin. 
Another man with a will as strong declared a war to win.

And the earth was shaking, and the people prayed for their

Gathering evil in all its might.

She is queen alone in the human zone, dethroned the king unpure.

where the elder ones are joined

they walk. 
Now you must use your power. Show the human race you are the

Use their trust forever and then deceive their weakened minds. 
Fool them to destroy themselves in hopelessness. 
Belie their seeds, belie their dreams. Hope has ceased to be."" 
The people worshiped their queen. 
Such beauty before her time was unseen. 
Their were fooled by her presence and disguise. 
Faithfully they listened and swallowed all her lies. 
""The times are changing, re-arranging he pattern of our lives. 
So let your heart stop beating beneath this twisted sky."" 
They were embraced by sadness, but not afraid to die. 
""So pass this sacred dagger and let yourself fly free. 
So pretend you're dreaming and rise above this world of you 
and me.""

to the higher ground.

Eternal detest from the ones left unblessed, so possessed. 
Their last caress was your knife in their hearts. 
Fed from her deed, watching them bleed. 
In her own conceit, a world to delete, lies at her feet. 
Her demon inside do no longer hide. 
Showing its face of hate and disgrace leaving their saviour 
unpraised.] 

The ones who didn't follow. 
Now sharing this moment of grief. 
The end of their own existence? 
In death they had no belief. 
Despite all the faith in their queen they couldn't believe 
what they had seen. 
What was the reason for this sacrifice. 
Nothing is gained from this great demise. 
After the ordeal we know she has the powers to decieve us all. 
But their dream of sons and daughters has made them standing 
tall. 
For the king had showed them it could be done when his woman 
gave birth to the sacred one. 
But is she of man, made of flesh and blood, or is she the 
offspring of the unholy

A leader was chosen to unveil the hidden truth. 
The brave ones were gathered, the strongest were sent to the 
queen. 
Her reason to be must be known. 
After many moons the troopsreach the temple of their majesty. 
Guarded by a hundred faithful knights. 
There is no escape, there's no entry to her sacred halls. 
Is our vision true or false? 
They rtied to find the answer but they were led astray into a 
maze of slumper far from the light of day. 
The riddle remained unanswered. 
The queen could read ones mind, make sure that no one will find 
the reason for her mission here. 
The highness writhe in anger, her trust had been betrayed. 
The queen was filled with langour, her decision has been made. 
She would unleash her hate. 
Destined to devastate. 
She heard her demons roar, marching into war. 
The spirit of their beloved king ho spoke unto his men, he 
came to bring a message 
of great importance and trust. 
""The gift from the gods has come to cover the world in dust. 
Her forces are closing in to your sanctuary. 
So use your imagination to end her reign. 
Remember these words, and be strong!"" 
The chosen few were sacrificed for the others life. 
They were the bait, they would seal the soldiers fate. 
A massive grave, to break the soldiers spell. 
The forces fell into the abyss, never to rise again. 
Towards the queen the last of the brave ones wandered, 
to terminate this creature non-divine. 
The loss of troops forced her powers to release the magic 
uncontrolled that had wasted a thousand soul. 
The palace controlled by demons is the heart of all evil pos- 
sessed by the queen and her unholy servants. 
""If we destroy it, the earth will be ours and it will bring us 
eternal existance. 
We'll pray for the gift of breeding. This is a game we can't 
concede, 
it is worth all the blood we may bleed. We must close the gate 
so she can't return. We'll seal her fate, watch her temple 
burn and 
we'll capture her soul in the chambers of crimson sleep. 
And there she will suffer eternally for what she has done to 
man. 
We fought our way into her dwelling-place, we searched the 
corridors 
of this infernal maze, to seek our enemy the one to slay. 
We are the ones, we will not obey. 
A disillusioned servant with great knowledge in her secrets, 
we found him walking aimlessly trying to find his peace. 
He said: 
'Cover her eyes, they are the root of her inhuman forces. 
Then she's just the child you thought she, 
disconnect all her sources.'"" 
They found a way to blind her and it could cost some lives. 
But they must seal the entry from where all evil derives. 
Two of the brave ones were sent to distract her while the 
others made their way 
to behind her throne. 
She saw her enemies for the last time 
as their leader covered her eyes. 
We saw the return of innocence, the symbol of purity we once 
knew. 
We carried her to the chambers to forever lock-up her soul. 
And now the reborn earth, blessed with the gift of birth can 
see her in this cage

Confess your sins to God, don't be afraid.

made. I can heal your wounds and cleanse
your soul, but never return all those
lives you stole.

Abandon your thoughts to the mighty.
Into the chapel of holyness, live for the
Sacred empire, engender the Enigma.

[Psalm 2 'Celestial Dissension']
The further side, a confounded lie, panegyration a reunion of riddles? 
The sorrow, the funeral truth, mentally fraud wih pseudo relics, enigma, unholy, ungodly, commander of the regeneration.

Insidious and caught, implored by disgrace. 
Inhumation... The burial of man. Confession... 
Unify all evil. Deep inside, the unknown quest, the sphere is so depressaid, 
a harp with broken strings, and the ground, this mazy world do still exist, 
then ghouls arise fromthe mist. 

Renascent through the holy scripture, submission to what for us is illusion. 
From the tenebrous depths of history, who will divulge the mystery.

At the dark end of the hall,

Slower than a slow dance on a hot summer night.
Faster than the skin breaks on the edge of a knife,

What's it mean to be alive?

At her first sight of snow;
Saw an old man dying
In a room he didn't know.
While the world turns through the ages,
It's a most peculiar ride.
Holding on to one another,
Moving at the speed of life.
We just go on at the speed of life.
A family on the midway, in the carnival lights,
Moving in a circle through the sounds and the sights,
And it all goes by at the speed of life.

But you are strange! You are guilty I guess!
And after the torture you will confess and burn!

Is to take a picture

Sacred hell, sacred hell

So the fend must be back on our ball
Lose all your sins, lose all your sorrows

But a 1000 Masters of disguise
Eternal damnation 'cause humans they hide
They think that Satan shall rise",Sacred Hell
Edguy,"Seasons come and seasons go
Here I wait for something to be
Try to get as much as I can see
Hungry for life
But have you see the sands of time
Every day is a moment in past
Every heartbeat a step to my last
I won't survive

I don't know what time is made to be
If it is a friend or enemy or does it only run
Run to set and end
Secrets of a crazy dream or just a bad
Reality, I don't know

Do you feel the sands of time
Runnin' low to break the line
First we learn to fly, then we learn to cry
Later in the evening we will die

Questions roamin' through my brain
I'll be leavin' into a grave
I'll be dead but my soul will be save
For a time called forever

All the seasons will have been gone
There'll be times that you will forget
My name and the words that I said
Then my time will be over",Sands of Time
Edguy,"[Sammet]
Open my eyes and see my bleeding wounded hands...
Feeling the pain too hard to stand...To stand
Caught in the now and here
While they are on the way.
Hiding imagination, leading us astray...

Use your mind!
You will leave the flesh dimensions behind
Sanity can be the toll
Leading to the core of your soul

[Chorus]
We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy
We are the kingdom of light and dreams
Gnosis and life... Avantasia!
We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy
We are the kingdom of light and dreams
Gnosis and life... Avantasia!

Walking along the icy gallery of pain
Tell me now... What can keep the flame alive?
Lack of imagination - raising up the tower
Where they hold our souls
To take away the power.

Watching a face and a smile and a light
When yo're walking alone in the street
I know your look always gives you the might
Many miles from your ass to your feet
And I dream what I've seen
Is what I want it to be selfmade reality
How many miles to the gate of reality
How many steps left to go to my dreams
How many miles to the land where my dreams come true
Dreams which come true just have died
Look like a queen but you talk like a pawn and I know you're a fool in disguise
Godfather tell me how to carry on
Blinded by fantasies of lies
And I dream what I've seen
Is what I want it to be self made reality
How many miles to the gate of reality
How many steps left to go to my dreams
How many miles to the land where my dreams come true
Dreams which come true just have died
I see your smile, a golden masquerade
And I know my dream it will be my fate
Time has stolen my fantasy
'Cause it has become a pale reality

Deep inside your mind
Some call us their fantasy
But some do never find
We can teach philosophy
But still we must commend...
The state of our existence
Right into your hand

Welcome to this place in here
Come overstep all your fears...

Where have you all been once
When I was alone?
When I was a hero
In their crazy wicked show
You've sent no little spark
Into my darkened view of life.
Did not make me ask
For what is wrong and what is right.

And still I regret to be here.
I'm dreaming of Anna in tears...

May justice be done
I hold on to pray but no god seems to hear me
The pain I will face is my price for disgrace
For things that I've never done

The toll of the bell and the flight of the raven
They open my cell and I feel it's too late
There's no need to yell they don't want to hear me
The morning has come
It seems like my work's been done.
Today I'll be the one

Sometimes it's good to be schizophrene
Cause when I'm close to the end I've got always a friend
On my lonesome way to the final decay
I listen to a voice telling me

[Chorus]

Now dream away, follow me astray
To a world that we can reach on wings of a dream

[Repeat]

I've got the key to the end of the nightmare
To leave all the dreams of bane and despair
The life I redeem has got the price of insanity
That you just can't get cause you're not even mad
You only trust in your eyes

Once upon a time there was a noble man like me
He only cared about the things he saw
One dark night without a moon he loved
The dog of his queen
Thinking it was her he enjoyed the life in the raw

Edguy,"Sitting by the window 
Staring out into the night 
Waiting up for the light of day 
And the sound of silence 
The faintly flaring candle light 
Parting has got me 
Around to go insane 
Alone I try to while away my time 
Seconds turn to ages 
As I close my eyes and wait 
Sometimes I wonder 
What's the reason why 
We long for someone to embrace 
And say hello to say goodbye 
Carry on - and I will forever 
Longing drives bad memories away 
And still carry on and I will forever 
Cause when I see you smile 
I dare to believe again 
Is there anybody out there 
To keep on looking for 
If you don't know then lie to me 
Blue eyed for a letdown 
If this is what it takes 
To maybe see the light 
I'll dare to shed another tear 
Oh I Know 
The blows cold tonight 
But anyhow I gotta go 
Tell me girl where are you now 
Carry on an I will forever
I tried to build a wall 
And let nobody in 
To be on my own 
Without love and without pain 
Without pain 
I don't know why 
But everywhere 
I look into your face 
Into your face 
I am caught and I relapse again 
Carry on, it's forever 
Longing drives and memories away 
Carry on and I will forever",Forever
Edguy,"When you wake up in the fire 
And your harbor lies in ruins 
You wonder why the giant has been shot 
Fired off down from the sky 
You plead for explanation 
Is it accident or rule 
And where is your childhood hero 
To drive all the demons away 
What if the light 
Shines in darkness my friend 
And darkness just can't comprehend 
So blaze the trail on your own 
Go it alone 
We are falling, falling to rise 
Pain is the guide out of the wastelands 
We don't need a hero 
We are falling, falling to rise 
No charlatan to show you the light 
We don't need a hero 
Indignity is the leader 
To escort us to fen 
Where they say the light is endemic 
If only I could comprehend 
Now you're old enough to face it

Hit you as they watch your tracks 
Apart from the way that they understand

If wondering is heaven or hell
You say that you've got the view

Nor cryptic message scrawled upon every wall

Nor fearful gestures made for instant recall
In lies your heart will not share

The spirit that guides you follow it through
To the spirit inside you always be true
You know you'll despair
If the spirit inside is used without care

The battlefield of glory pales into rust
The river flows much thicker fed by each thrust
No beast alive does compare
The spirit beside you everywhere
Let not your head be turned by tainted reward
And dreams of fortune won forever to hoard
Your conscience could not repair
The spirit inside used without care

Cause it will be your shelter, help you how to decide
And it will be your helper should your loyalties divide

You long to be see-through, so nobody can tell
Whenever they make you bleed your pride away

Now you're driven by one track mind, initiating you
Splendid flowers, blossom from the wounds
The strong of the poison, sweetest as the bloom
Don't you try to stand your ground
'Cause you're only coming home

Through the heart of fire
You're home, found the asylum
In a world with a broken dance, on shards of glass
I see fire, ruins and fire, and fire
In world with a broken dance, with shattered dreams

It's burning inside you, it's emotional hell
And you keep on smiling, upon the icy tides
A stream of fire, to sweep the fears away
Seems like forever, too long you've had to wait
Locked in darkness, for wicked harmony
Little angel thrown away, she'll be back another day

Through the heart of fire
You're home, found the asylum

Come seek humiliation, now let them dance

We go all the way, do we need the pain?
Waking up in a black tomorrow
I've been there before, was it all wasted again?
We go all the way, do we need the pain?

Contando cada sombra no seu sonho atormentado acorrentado sei lá, drogado se pá
Enfraquecido, injustiçado, se afogando no mar eu to lá, lado a lado com a fé no coração
Nem que pra isso eu amanheça dormindo no chão, meu irmão!

We came back to see her
She was older cold and even mean
Not like we remembered

Out along the old road
Where the Indian Paintbrush grows
She began to cry and said she wanted us to know

There were hard times
When the family was broken
There were hard times
Then she lit up a smoke and said

Gonna open up my umbrella and keep it off of me
It's so easy to go somewhere

When I hear the clock and see the dust come off the chair

There were hard times
I don't wanna remember
There were hard times
And I don't want to see ya

And one man was lying over blood and a broom
The store door was swingin' in a midnight breeze
And another man ran through the dark and the trees
Lost in the moment of what he needs
Lost in the moment of what he needs
He ran past the motel threw his gun in the trash
Looked down through the darkness and counted the cash
The man at the store was trying to stand
Looked up through the white light and reached out his hand
Lost in the moment of what he needs
Lost in the moment of what he needs
Are you there can you hear me
Are you there
The ambulance arrived but it was too late
In the spin of the red lights they covered his face
He had a wife who was waiting watching TV in bed
Wondering why he wasn't home yet
Their baby was sleeping until the telephone rang
He woke and he cried out but nobody came
Lost in the moment of what he needs
Lost in the moment of what he needs
Are you there can you hear me
Are you there
She doesn't know what they'll do now now that he's gone
Try to get over and try to get on

She wanted to kiss him and brush back his hair

He was fine before he met her
Eyes like faded jeans, soft and blue and he had seen
Everything, and he had been everywhere
Til he turned his gaze her way, longed to see it every day
Heard a voice inside him say you'll never never never be the same

Once in a while
Once in a blue moon
There comes somebody like you

They got fire and they got fever
He was more than fine; she was more than young
And the orange setting sun was beautiful
Ever so at ease, in the summer evening breeze
They would talk and they would tease
And never never never want to leave

Were all worried they've called the cops.
Are you crazy? Where have you gone?
She said what would you do if you were me?
When its suicide to stay, and murder to leave.
She ran out of gas down in New Mexico.
And got a job at a local cafe.
Friday nights they featured live rock and roll.
She fell in love with a boy who played.
He had soulful eyes and Indian blood.
No intention of staying around.
All he took was his harmonica and her heart when he left town.
He said what would you do if you were me?
When its suicide to stay, and murder to leave?
She never married but she did have a child.
A sweet young girl by the name of Sioux.
She had spirit and a heart breaking smile.
And some beat up moccasin boots.
And they had nothing but each others love.
An apartment by the tracks.
And when the day came that Sioux grew up. She said someday Ill be back.

With food, love, and more love?
But the voices from the airshaft remind me

Channel of amazing depth.

Water pulling under me.
I'm not moving, You move me.
I'm ready for this current now.
Take me to the river.

Edison Glass,"I shut all my windows
They protect me from the storm
I'm alone but I wait for someone
One who keeps the lights on
One who keeps the house warm

I feel a swaying rhythm
If we get swept to sea I'll be happy
It's all we wish for now
I wish you'd keep the lights down
I wish you'd keep the house warm

We have enough we can handle it
If we don't make I will fall apart
All is in vain for us.

I think we can make it now
I think that we can make it
I wish you'd keep the lights down
I wish you'd keep the house warm

They are screaming with
A perpetuate and constant flowing
Rhyming and flowing

You mean the world to me
Are we ok? Maybe we can talk about it

Do you feel?

I can make this last
And I can hold you tightly
When loneliness has never felt so alive

You look beautiful now
You look prettier now

Are you ok? Maybe we can talk about it",You Mean the World to Me

She knew, it seemed
That sound, that song was troubling me

Do tell
No, no, no
Please, sir
Here we go

Sleepwalking, sleep, sleepwalking

Last night, I awoke to an opera house full of empty seats
Performing Einstein on the beach
You've stifled this too long and the dream inside is far too strong
You've got to, got to, learn to let go, let go

Open your lips
Let out a song
Open your heart
And let it sing

Open your heart

Que no se apartan de mí
El día que te conocí
La noche que te perdí

No sé que pueda decirte
O lo que tengo que hacer
Para volver a mirarme
En esos ojos que amé

Al cielo pido silencio
Para que no vuelvas a mi
O que tan sólo me diga
Que es lo que ha sido de ti

Regresa mi amor te lo pido
A menos que seas muy feliz
Regresa para que compruebes

Que pierdes el tiempo sin mi
Para que no busques en nadie
Lo que tienes en mi

Dos espinas llevo clavadas
Muy dentro del corazón
Nuestra primera vez
Y lo que no pudo ser

A Dios le pido que entiendas
Que si alguien te ama soy yo
Me duelen tanto tus dudas
Pero yo se que vendrás

Regresa mi amor te lo pido
A menos que seas muy feliz
Regresa para que compruebes

Que pierdes el tiempo sin mi
Para que no busques en nadie
Lo que tienes en mi

Como tú me tienes
Tan ilusionada
Tan dueño de mi alma te confías

Por qué dices que me quieres
Me provocas y me hieres

Porque estoy enamorada
Tú te burlas y me engañas
Porque soy tan entregada
Es que abusas tú de mí

Porque estoy enamorada
Me he negado muchas veces
A caer en otros brazos te aprovechas
Porque sabes que yo estoy enamorada

Sabes que me tienes
Tan desesperada
Tan dueño de nada

Ni se pide ni se ruega ni se da

Las heridas de volver a equivocarnos
Levantarse y corregir de tener la vista en alto

Pero ya no encontré dentro de tía
Lo que hasta ayer me hizo
Sentir tan mujer

Cuando grita la piel
Es mejor escucharla
Porque está conectada
En línea recta al corazón
No soporta que el silencio
Se haga dueño del amor

Cuando grita la piel
Es que ya está cansada
De esperas que el invierno
No se acabe de marchar
Es que no aguanta tanto frio
Es que ya no resiste más

Cuando grita la piel

Dime
¿Dónde están las cosas que decías?
Lo que me juraste
¿A dónde volverá?

Cuando grita la piel
Es mejor escucharla
Porque está conectada
En línea recta al corazón
No soporta que el silencio
Se haga dueño del amor

Cuando grita la piel
Es que ya está cansada
De esperar que el invierno
No se acabe de marchar
Es que no aguanta tanto frio
Es que ya no resiste más

Cuando grita la piel

",Cuando Grita La Piel
Edith Márquez,"Déjenme si estoy llorando
Ni un consuelo estoy buscando
Quiero estar solo con mi dolor

Si me ves que a solas voy llorando
Es que estoy de pronto recordando
A un amor que aun no consigo
Olvidar

Déjame si estoy llorando
Es que sigo procurando
En cada lagrima darme paz

Desechándola se llena el alma
Si ha sufrido perdiendo la calma
Y yo quiero olvidar que tu amor
Ya se fue

Si me ven que estoy llorando
Es que solo voy sacando
La nostalgia que ahora vive en mi
No me pidan ni una explicación
Si es que va a dañar mi corazón

La felicidad que ya perdí
Me ha negado en este mar de llanto
Sentiré que no te quise tanto
Y quizás me olvidare de ti

Déjenme si estoy llorando
Que no puedo soportar
Vivir sin ella ni un minuto más

Déjenme solo con este dolor
Que fue mi error
No aceptar el final
Distanciarlo fue mejor

Que poco a poco las lagrimas
Borran los recuerdos la nostalgia
O al menos trata de de engañar al alma
Disfrazando la soledad
Pero la verdad no es esa

Porque también yo no lo olvido
Mi conciencia aun esta conmigo
De tus labios no me he desprendido
A pesar de todo no lo consigo

He intentado alejarte de mi lado
No he encontrado el método correcto de lógralo
Recordarla a cada momento por tanto tiempo
Me es imposible olvidar, sin razonar déjenme llorar

Si me ven que estoy llorando
Es que solo voy sacando
La nostalgia que ahora vive en mi
No me pidan ni una explicación
Si es que va a dañar mi corazón

La felicidad que ya perdí
Lo ha negado en este mar de llanto
Sentiré que no te quise tanto
Y quizás me olvidare de ti

",Déjenme Si Estoy Llorando
Edith Márquez,"No renunciaré
A esa flor que tu me das cada mañana
A vivir conscientemente enamorada
A soñar juntos los dos de madrugada

No renunciaré
A la luz que tu me das si estoy a oscuras
A saber que esto es amor y no aventura
A encontrar limpio el camino de la duda

No renunciaré
Ni a tus ojos, ni a tus brazos ni a tu boca
Ni a tu risa, ni a tu loco proceder
Ni a tus besos con los que me vuelvo loca
Ni a la fuerza con que tu me haces querer

No renunciaré
Ni a tus ojos, ni a tus brazos ni a tu boca
Ni a tu risa, ni a tu loco proceder
Ni a tus besos con los que me vuelvo loca
Ni a la fuerza con que tu me haces querer

No renunciaré
A la luz que tu me das si estoy a oscuras
A saber que esto es amor y no aventura
A encontrar limpio el camino de la duda

No renunciaré
Yo sin ti sería un barco a la deriva
Una más de las que van por él perdidas
Y sin ti sentido no tendría mi vida

No renunciaré
Ni a tus ojos, ni a tus brazos ni a tu boca
Ni a tu risa, ni a tu loco proceder
Ni a tus besos con los que me vuelvo loca
Ni a la fuerza con que tu me haces querer

No renunciaré

Edith Márquez,"Perdona si te estoy llamando en este momento
Pero me hacía falta escuchar de nuevo
Aunque sea un instante tu respiración

Disculpa se que estoy violando nuestro juramento
Se que estás con alguien, que no es el momento
Pero hay algo urgente que decirte hoy

Estoy muriendo, muriendo por verte
Agonizando muy lento y muy fuerte

Vida, devuélveme mis fantasías
Mis ganas de vivir la vida
Devuélveme el aire

Cariño mío, sin ti yo me siento vacío
Las tardes son un laberinto
Y las noches me saben
A puro dolor

Quisiera decirte que hoy estoy de maravilla
Que no me ha afectado lo de tu partida
Pero con un dedo no se tapa el sol

Estoy muriendo, muriendo por verte
Agonizando muy lento y muy fuerte

Vida, devuélveme mis fantasías
Mis ganas de vivir la vida
Devuélveme el aire

Cariño mío, sin ti yo me siento vacío
Las tardes son un laberinto
Y las noches me saben
A puro dolor

Agonizando a puro dolor
A puro dolor, agonizando
Pues no te tengo a mi lado

Estoy muriendo
Agonizando a puro dolor
A puro dolor, agonizando

Edith Márquez,"Decir te quiero decir amor no significa nada
Las palabras sinceras las que tienen valor son
Las que salen del alma

Preguntas sin respuestas llenas de

Como una piedra en un rio
Y un amor como el mio no se puede acabar
Ni estando lejos te olvido
Y no se puede quemar porque esta hecho
De fuego, ni perder ni ganar
Porque este amor no es un juego

Comme égaré, presqu'ignoré
Voici qu'en la nuit étoilée
Un nouveau-né nous est donné
Jean-François Nicot il se nomme
Il est joufflu, tendre et rosé
À l'église, beau petit homme
Demain tu seras baptisé

Une cloche sonne, sonne
Sa voix, d'écho en écho
Dit au monde qui s'étonne:
""C'est pour Jean-François Nicot
C'est pour accueillir une âme
Une fleur qui s'ouvre au jour
À peine, à peine une flamme
Encore faible qui réclame
Protection, tendresse, amour""

Village au fond de la vallée
Loin des chemins, loin des humains
Voici qu'après dix-neuf années
Cœur en émoi, le Jean-François
Prend pour femme la douce Elise
Blanche comme fleur de pommier
Devant Dieu, dans la vieille église
Ce jour, ils se sont mariés

Toutes les cloches sonnent, sonnent
Leurs voix, d'écho en écho
Merveilleusement couronnent
La noce à François Nicot
""Un seul cœur, une seule âme""
Dit le prêtre, ""et, pour toujours
Soyez une pure flamme
Qui s'élève et qui proclame
La grandeur de votre amour""

Village au fond de la vallée
Des jours, des nuits, le temps a fui
Voici qu'en la nuit étoilée
Un c?ur s'endort, François est mort
Car toute chair est comme l'herbe
Elle est comme la fleur des champs
Epis, fruits mûrs, bouquets et gerbes
Hélas! vont en se desséchant

Une cloche sonne, sonne
Elle chante dans le vent
Obsédante et monotone
Elle redit aux vivants:
""Ne tremblez pas, c?urs fidèles
Dieu vous fera signe un jour
Vous trouverez sous son aile
Avec la vie éternelle

Edith Piaf,"Notre bonheur est merveilleux.
Notre amour fait plaisir à Dieu.
Il est plus pur, il est plus clair
Que l'eau limpide des rivières.
Mon coeur étouff' quand tu es là.
Ne touche pas à tout cela !

Si un jour,
Tu brisais notre amour,
Si un jour,
Tu partais pour toujours,
Tout sombrerait dans la nuit.
Les oiseaux, dans leurs nids,
Ne chanteraient plus
Leurs chants éperdus.
Si un jour,
Tu brisais notre amour,
Si un jour,
Tu partais sans retour,
Les fleurs perdraient leur parfum
Et ce serait la fin de toute joie.
Reste avec moi.
Crois-moi, c'est vrai :
J'en mourrais si tu partais.

Tes yeux pour moi sont bien plus beaux
Qu'un rayon de lune dans l'eau.
Lorsque tu pars quelques instants,
C'est comme la neige au printemps.
Tu reviens, tu me tends les bras.

Souffrir par toi

Et que tes poings
Ont l'air d'être lourds,
J'dis toujours oui
Et t'en profites
Et j't'obéis.

Ah... t'es pas méchant.
T'es un peu brute.
C'est pas d'ta faute

J'ai peur des coups,

Alors j'dis rien
Parce que je t'aime

C'est bon tout d'même.
Puis ça vaut mieux
Car j'aurais tort.
Y a qu'à nous voir,
C'est toi le plus fort.

Mais y a des jours
Où t'es plus l'même.
Quand t'as l'cafard
Ou des ennuis,
Quand t'as besoin d'sentir
Qu'on t'aime
Et ces jours-là,
Tu deviens tout petit.
Alors j'te prends
Sur ma poitrine.
J'écoute ton c?ur
Et c'est très doux.
J'deviens toute grande
Et j'te câline.
J'suis presque heureuse
Et j'oublie tout.
Là, dans mes bras,
T'oses plus rien dire.
T'as sur les lèvres
Un beau sourire
Et, comme un p'tit môme,
Tu t'endors.

Là-haut dans l'Nord où c'qu'y a du vent.

Il avait la fraud' dans le sang.
Il attendait les nuits sans lune
- Quand i'fait sombre, on pass'bien mieux. -
Pour s'faufiler par les grand's dunes
Où l'vent de la mer nous piqu'les yeux.

Ohé, la douane !
Ohé, les gabelous !
Lâchez tous les chiens
Et puis planquez-vous
Au fond d'vos cabanes.

Au fond d'vos cabanes,

Et lâchez les chiens.
Ohé, les gabelous !
Ohé, la douane !

Quand il avait rien d'autre à faire,
Les nuits où qu'il faisait trop clair,
Il changeait les poteaux frontières
Et foutait le monde à l'envers
Ou bien, d'autres fois, en plein passage,
Quand il avait bu un bon coup,
Il poussait de vrais cris sauvages
Et v'là qu'je passe dépêchez-vous.

Ohé, la douane !
Ohé, les gabelous !
Lâchez tous les chiens
Et puis planquez-vous

Regardez sur la dune

Ohé, la douane !

Il pouvait pas s'mettre dans la tête
Qu'la loi des hommes, c'est très sérieux.
C'était comme une sorte de poète
Et ces types-là, c'est dangereux.
Alors une nuit qu'y avait d'la lune,
Qu'y baladait pour son plaisir,
Ils l'ont étendu sur la dune
A coup d'fusil pour en finir.

Ohé, la douane !
Ohé, les gabelous !
Planquez tous vos chiens
Et puis amenez-vous.
Du fond d'vos cabanes,
C'est d'la belle ouvrage,
Seulement, ce soir,
Ce n'était qu'un homme.
Il travaillait pas.

Alors, fallait pas...

Un sourire d'ange.
J'allais passer sans le voir
Mais quand il m'a dit bonsoir
D'une voix chantante,
J'ai compris que, ce soir-là,
Malgré la pluie et le froid,
Je serais contente.
Il avait un regard très doux.
Il venait de je ne sais où.

D'où viens-tu ? Quel est ton nom ?
Le navire est ma maison.
La mer mon village.
Mon nom, nul ne le saura.
Je suis simplement un gars
Ardent à l'ouvrage
Et si j'ai le coeur trop lourd,
Donne-moi donc un peu d'amour,
J'ai soif de caresses.
Et moi, fille au coeur blasé,
J'ai senti, sous ses baisers,
Une tendre ivresse.
Il avait un regard très doux
Il venait de je ne sais où.

Simplement, sans boniments,
J'aimais mon nouvel amant,
Mon époux d'une heure.
Comme bien des malheureux,
Il croyait voir dans mes yeux
La femme qu'on pleure
Et, follement, j'espérais
Qu'au matin, il me dirait
Suis-moi je t'emmène.
J'aurais dit oui, je le sens,
Mais il a fui, me laissant
Rivée à ma chaîne.
Il avait un regard très doux.
Il venait de je ne sais où.

J'ai rêvé de l'étranger
Et, le coeur tout dérangé
Par les cigarettes,
Par l'alcool et le cafard,

M'a tourné la tête
Mais on dit que, près du port,
On a repêché le corps

Ne trouva pour le bercer
Que la mer câline.

Et pour que ma chanson soit belle
Je me content du refrain

Ils s'aimeront toute la vie

Et ces mots-là, ça compte tout de même.
On s'est aimé huit jours tout plein
Puis il m'a dit un beau matin :
""V'là que j'm'en vais. N'aie trop d'peine.
J'suis matelot, faut qu'tu comprennes.""

""Les marins ça fait des voyages.
On reste jamais pour bien longtemps.
On part joyeux, on revient content.

De s'faire du mal à son bonheur.
Faut pas pleurer ! Aie du courage !
La mer est belle et puis dis-toi
Qu'on n'y peut rien ni toi ni moi
Et qu'les marins, faut qu'ça voyage.""

J'l'ai vu partir sur son navire.
Y m'faisait d'loin un beau sourire,
Et d'un seul coup je n'l'ai plus vu
Et puis l'bateau a disparu.
La mer chantait d'une voix câline.
On a parlé comme des copines.

Les marins ça fait des voyages.
On reste jamais pour bien longtemps.
S'il revient joyeux, il repart content.
Pour les aimer, faut du courage,
Mais les retours c'est tout plaisir
Et leurs amours peuvent pas mourir.
Le voilà qui part, mon pauvr'bonheur.
Dessus la mer vogue mon coeur
Mais v'là qu'je pense qu'y a des naufrages.
Sois bonne, la mer : ne l'garde pas.
Si tu veux bien, on partagera,
Comme les marins, faut qu'ça voyage.

J'l'ai attendu pendant des s'maines,
Et puis maint'nant c'est plus la peine.
Il m'a fait dire par ses amis
Qu'y r'viendrait plus, qu'c'était fini.
Il m'avait fait cadeau d'une bague.
Je l'ai jetée au creux des vagues.

Les marins ça fait des voyages.
On les espère pendant longtemps.
Y'en a qui r'viennent de temps en temps.
D'autres s'font voler l'coeur au passage.
Y a plus d'retour, y a plus d'plaisir.
Y a plus d'amour, y a qu'à mourir.
Celui qu'j'aimais, y r'viendra pas
Et puis s'y r'vient, il recommenc'ra,
Car les marins, faut qu'ça voyage.
Ça court toujours vers d'autres bonheurs
Et ça nous laisse avec notre coeur,
Notre coeur fané pour tout partage.","Les Marins, Ça Fait des Voyages"
Edith Piaf,"1. D'un bout à l'autre de la s'maine
Sur les boul'vards, dans les faubourgs,
On les voit traîner par centaine,
Leurs guêtres sal's et leurs amours
Dans des chemises de dix jours,
Sous la lumièr' des réverbères
Prenant des airs de Pompadour,
Ce sont nos belles Ferronnières ;
Ce sont nos poupé's, nos guignols, nos pantins,
Ecoutez dans la nuit ell's chantent ce refrain :

R : C'est nous les mômes, 
Les môm's de la cloche,
Clochard's qui s'en vont
Sans un rond en poche,
C'est nous les paumées,
Les puré's d'paumées,
Qui sommes aimées
Un soir n'importe où
Nous avons pourtant
L'c?ur pas exigeant, 
Mais personn'n'en veut,
Ben tant pis pour eux,
Quéqu'ça fout,
On s'en fout,
Nul ne s'y accroche
Il n'y'a pas d'amour
Et l'on s'ra toujours
Les môm's de la cloche

2. Mais comme ell's n'ont pas les toilettes
Qu'il faut pour les quartiers rupins,
C'n'est pas aux gal'ries La fayette
Qu'ell's vont fair' chaqu' soir leur turbin :
Le long du Canal Saint-Martin,
Au Sébasto, à la Chapelle,
On est toujours assez grandin
Pour le Monsieur qui vous appelle,
C'est d'larticl' populair' c'n'est pas du beau joujou,
Y'a ps d'poupée en soie aux bazars à trent'sous

R : C'est nous les mômes,

Clochard's qui s'en vont
Sans un rond en poche,
C'est nous les paumées,
Les puré's d'paumé'es,
Qui sommes aimées
Un soir n'importe où
Tout comm' nos ribouis
On n'est pas verni's,
Jamais l'on ira
Sur la Riviera
Quéqu'ça fout, 
On s'en fout,
Quand l'agent nous fauche,
On va fair' quatr' jours
Là-bas dans la tour, 
Les môm's de la cloche

3. Ell's ont vendu tout's leurs carresses
Ell's fur'nt payé's tant bien que mal,
Mais un jour plus rien dans la caisse,
Ell's vont se fich' dans le canal.
Et sans avoir comme un cheval
La pitié des gens de la rue
On les emporte à l'hôpital ;
La foule dit : ce n'est qu'un' grue,
Et voilà comment les poupé's, les pantins, 
Lorsqu'ell's n'ont plus le sou s'en vont tout's à Pantin.

R : C'est nous les mômes, 
Les môm's de la cloche,
Clochard's qui s'en vont
Sans ami, sans proche,
C'est nous les paumées,
Les puré's d'paumées,
Qui s'en vont dormir
Dans l'horrible trou
Derrièr' not' convoi
Jamais l'on ne voit
Ni fleur, ni couronne,
Mêm' pas un' personne

C’était un gars que la déveine
Avait un jour pris par le bras
Pour m’emmener dormir à Fresnes
Et c’est des trucs qu’on oublie
Tombé d’un vilain paradis
Avec un drôle de regard étrange
Qu’avait pas l’air d’être avec lui
Dans les endroits où l’on va boire
Croyant noyer tous ses ennuis
Il trimballait ses idées noires
Mais ses ennuis nageaient mieux que lui

Il couchait avec la détresse
C’est pas une fille à fréquenter
Et c’est pour ça que ses maîtresses
L’une après l’autre l’avait quitté
Il avait du malheur à revendre
Mais personne pour lui acheter
Alors l’histoire de lui en prendre
Moi je me suis mise à l’aimer
J’allais venir à bout de sa misère
On devait s’épouser en Janvier
Comme par hasard y’a eu la guerre
Alors on n’a pas pu se marier

Alors il s’est mis à m’écrire
Des mots qu’il n’avait jamais dit
Avant il pouvait pas le dire
Personne lui avait appris
Il disait « j’apprends l’espérance
Je sais que tout va commencer
Tu es mon gala de bienfaisance
Et grâce à toi tout va changer »
Je pensais la déveine se repose
C’était pour mieux lui marcher dessus
On l’a retrouvé parmi les choses
Mort avant même d’avoir vécu",Il Riait

Depuis je suis desesperee

Je te vois partout sur la terre

Ma nuit, mes jours, mes aubes claires

Tu es partout car tu es dans mon coeur
Tu es partout car tu es mon bonheur

Meme la vie ne represente que toi
Des fois je reve que je suis dans tes bras
Et qu'a l'oreille tu me parles tout bas
Tu dis des choses qui font fermer les yeux
Et moi je trouve ca merveilleux

Peut-etre un jour tu reviendras
Je sais que mon coeur t'attendras
Tu ne pourras pas oublier
Les jours que nous avons passes
Mes yeux te cherchent sans arret
Ecoute bien mon coeur t'appelle
Nous pourrons si bien nous aimer

We loved each other tenderly
Like we loved all lovers
Then when day you left me
Ever since I've been desperate
I see you everywhere in the sky
I see you everywhere on the earth
You are my joy and my sun
My nights, my days, my clear dawns

(CHORUS)

You are everywhere because you are in my heart
You are everywhere because you are my happiness
Everything that is around me
Even life does not represent you
Sometimes I dream that I am in your arms
And you speak softly in my ear
You tell me things that make me close my eyes
And I find that marvellous

Maybe one day you will return
I know that my heart waits for you
You can not forget
The past days we spent together
My eyes never stop searching for you
Listen well, my heart calls you
We can love each other again
And you'll see life would be beautiful

Pour ta femme infidèle
Bravo! Bravo!
Et tu fais la vaisselle
Bravo! Bravo!

Le cirque est déserté
Le rire est inutile
Mon clown est enfermé
Dans un certain asile
Succès de camisole
Bravos de cabanon
Des mains devenues folles
Lui battent leur chanson

Je suis roi et je règne
Bravo! Bravo!
J'ai des rires qui saignent
Bravo! Bravo!
Venez, que l'on m'acclame
J'ai fait mon numéro
Tout en jetant ma femme
Du haut du chapiteau
Bravo! Bravo!",Bravo Pour le Clown
Edith Piaf,"C’est l’amour qui fait qu’on aime
C’est l’amour qui fait rêver
C’est l’amour qui veut qu’on s’aime
C’est l’amour qui fait pleurer

Mais tous ceux qui croient qu’ils s’aiment
Ceux qui font semblant d’aimer
Oui, tous ceux qui croient qu’ils s’aiment
Ne pourront jamais pleurer

Dans l’amour, il faut des larmes
Dans l’amour, il faut donner

Et ceux qui n’ont pas de larmes
Ne pourrons jamais aimer
Il faut tant, et tant de larmes
Pour avoir, le droit d’aimer

Mon amour, oh, toi que j’aime
Tu me fais souvent pleurer

J’ai donné, donné mes larmes
J’ai pleuré pour mieux t’aimer
J’ai payé de tant de larmes
Pour toujours, le droit d’aimer
Pour toujours, le droit d’aimer",C'est l'Amour
Edith Piaf,"Peut-être bien qu'ailleurs
Une femme a le cœur
Éperdu de bonheur
Comme moi
Et que d'un geste heureux
Elle soulève un peu
Le rideau de soie bleue
Comme moi
Pour regarder en bas
Son amour qui viendra
La prendre dans ses bras
Comme moi
Elle attend son amour
Les yeux de son amour
Les bras de son amour
Comme moi

Peut-être bien aussi
Qu'à l'instant, elle vit
Le meilleur de sa vie
Comme moi
Et qu'en fermant les yeux
Elle abandonne un peu
Sa main dans ses cheveux
Comme moi
Peut-être qu'à son cœur
Elle épingle une fleur
Et puis regarde l'heure
Comme moi
Et pense à son amour
Aux yeux de son amour
Aux bras de son amour
Comme moi

Peut-être bien encore
Qu'elle entendra plus fort
Son cœur battre et qu'alors
Comme moi
Elle voudra crier
En entendant monter
Un pas dans l'escalier
Comme moi
Comme moi dans l'instant
Où mon cœur en suspens
Se retient un moment
Contre toi
Et puis meurt, mon amour
Dans tes yeux, mon amour
Dans tes bras mon amour
Mon amour",Comme Moi
Edith Piaf,"Esgourdez rien qu'un instant
La goualante du pauvre Jean
Que les femmes n'aimaient pas
Mais n'oubliez pas
Dans la vie y a qu'une morale
Qu'on soit riche ou sans un sou
Sans amour on n'est rien du tout (On n'est rien du tout)

Il vivait au jour le jour
Dans la soie et le velours
Il pionçait dans de beaux draps
Mais n'oubliez pas
Dans la vie on est peau de balle
Quand notre cœur est au clou
Sans amour on n'est rien du tout (On n'est rien du tout)

Il bectait chez les barons
Il guinchait dans les salons
Et lichait tous les tafias
Mais n'oubliez pas
Rien ne vaut une belle fille
Qui partage votre ragoût
Sans amour on n'est rien du tout (On n'est rien du tout)

Pour gagner des picaillons
Il fut un méchant larron
On le saluait bien bas
Mais n'oubliez pas
Un jour on fait la pirouette
Et derrière les verrous
Sans amour on n'est rien du tout (On n'est rien du tout)

Esgourdez bien jeunes gens
Profitez de vos vingt ans
On ne les a qu'une fois
Et n'oubliez pas
Plutôt qu'une cordelette
Mieux vaut une femme à son cou
Sans amour on n'est rien du tout (On n'est rien du tout)

Et voilà mes braves gens
La goualante du pauvre Jean
Qui vous dit en vous quittant
Aimez-vous!",La Goualante du Pauvre Jean
Edith Piaf,"Mon Dieu, mon Dieu, mon Dieu!
Laissez-le-moi
Encore un peu
Mon amoureux!
Un jour, deux jours, huit jours
Laissez-le-moi
Encore un peu
À moi

Le temps de s'adorer
De se le dire
Le temps de se fabriquer
Des souvenirs
Mon Dieu, oh oui mon Dieu!
Laissez-le-moi
Remplir un peu
Ma vie

Mon Dieu, mon Dieu, mon Dieu!
Laissez-le-moi
Encore un peu
Mon amoureux
Six mois, trois mois, deux mois
Laissez-le-moi
Pour seulement
Un mois

Le temps de commencer
Ou de finir
Le temps d'illuminer
Ou de souffrir
Mon Dieu, mon Dieu, mon Dieu!
Même si j'ai tort
Laissez-le-moi
Un peu
Même si j'ai tort
Laissez-le-moi

Encore",Mon Dieu
Edith Piaf,"Tu me fais tourner la tête
Mon manège à moi c'est toi
Je suis toujours à la fête
Quand tu m'prends dans tes bras
Je ferais le tour du monde
Ça ne tourn'rait pas plus qu'ça
La terre n'est pas assez ronde
Pour m'étourdir autant qu'toi

Ah, ce qu'on est bien tous les deux
Quand on est ensembl' nous deux
Quelle vie on a tous les deux
Quand on s'aime comme nous deux
On pourrait changer d'planète
Tant qu'j'ai mon coeur près du tien
J'entends les flonflons de la fête
Et la terre n'y est pour rien

Ah oui, parlons-en de la terre
Pour qui elle se prend, la terre?
Ma parol' 'y a qu'elle sur terre
Y'a qu'elle pour faire tant de mystères

Mais pour nous il y a pas de problèmes
Car c'est pour la vie qu'on s'aime
Et s'il y avait pas d'vie même
Nous on s'aimerait quand même

Car

Tu me fais tourner la tête
Mon manège à moi c'est toi
Je suis toujours à la fête
Quand tu me tiens dans tes bras
Je ferais le tour du monde
Ça ne tourn'rait pas plus qu'ça
La terre n'est pas assez ronde
Pour m'étourdir autant qu'toi

Edith Piaf,"Non, rien de rien, non, je ne regrette rien
Ni le bien qu'on m'a fait, ni le mal
Tout ça m'est bien égal
Non, rien de rien, non, je ne regrette rien
C'est payé, balayé, oublié, je me fous du passé

Avec mes souvenirs j'ai allumé le feu
Mes chagrins, mes plaisirs
Je n'ai plus besoin d'eux
Balayé les amours avec leurs trémolos
Balayé pour toujours
Je reparts a zéro

Non, rien de rien, non, je ne regrette rien
Ni le bien qu'on m'a fait, ni le mal
Tout ça m'est bien égal
Non, rien de rien, non, je ne regrette rien
Car ma vie, car mes joies
Aujourd’hui ça commence avec toi","Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien"
Edith Piaf,"Tire les ficelles
Tire les ficelles
Ton Polichinelle
Te tendras les bras

Tourne la baguette
Et ta marionnette
Penchera la tête
Et te sourira

Tant que tes doigts lestes
Commandent mes gestes
Tu te fous du reste
Ça ne compte pas

Tire les ficelles
Et Polichinelle
Aussitôt fera
Ce que tu voudras

Tire les ficelles
Tire les ficelles
Ton Polichinelle
Fera mille tours

Te dira, ""Je t'aime""
Cachera ses peines
Cachera sa haine
Sous les mots d'amour

J'irai dans le monde
Pour que toi dans l'ombre
Tu aies le triomphe
Auquel tu as droit

Ton Polichinelle
Fera tant de zèle
Que dès qu'on nous verra
On t'applaudira

Sais-tu seulement
Si j'ai un coeur
Sais-tu seulement
Si j'ai une âme

C'est pas prévu dans ton programme
De prestidigitateur

Tire les ficelles
Tire les ficelles
De Polichinelle
Mais prends garde à toi

Car il est possible
Que je me délivre
Des fils invisibles
Qui m'attachent à toi

En brisant le charme
Je retrouve une âme
Je redeviens femme
Je redeviens moi

Faut que t'en profites
On se lasse vite
Et le jour viendra
Où ça cassera
Où ça cassera
Où ça cassera",Polichinelle
Edith Piaf,"On n'a pas dans le cœur de quoi toujours aimer
Et l'on verse des pleurs en voulant trop aimer
On croit être sincère, on croit avoir trouvé
Le seul être sur terre qu'on ne peut remplacer
On n'a pas dans le cœur de quoi toujours aimer
Et l'on verses des pleurs en voulant trop aimer
Un jour on se réveille, ce n'est plus tout à fait
Le rayon de soleil qui vous embellissait

On regrette le temps où l'on croyait s'aimer
On regrette le temps où le cœur s'emballait
Il ne nous reste plus que quelques souvenirs
De pauvres souvenirs qu'on cherche à retenir

Mais moi, j'ai dans le cœur de quoi toujours aimer
J'aurai toujours assez de larmes pour pleurer
J'aurai toujours assez de rires pour effacer
Les tristes souvenirs accrochés au passé
Mais moi, j'ai dans le cœur de quoi toujours aimer
J'aurai toujours assez de larmes pour pleurer
Je veux toujours aimer, je veux toujours souffrir

Si je n'dois plus aimer, mois je préfre mourir
Mais, moi, j'ai dans le cœur de quoi toujours aimer",Toujours Aimer
Edith Piaf,"Des yeux qui font baisser les miens
Un rire qui se perd sur sa bouche
Voilà le portrait sans retouche
De l'homme auquel j'appartiens

Quand il me prend dans ses bras
Il me parle tout bas
Je vois la vie en rose

Il me dit des mots d'amour
Des mots de tous les jours
Et ça me fait quelque chose

Il est entré dans mon cœur
Une part de bonheur
Dont je connais la cause

C'est lui pour moi, moi pour lui dans la vie
Il me l'a dit, l'a juré pour la vie

Et dès que je l'aperçois
Alors je sens en moi
Mon cœur qui bat

Des nuits d'amour à ne plus en finir
Un grand bonheur qui prend sa place
Des ennuis, des chagrins, s'effacent
Heureux, heureux à en mourir

Il me parle tout bas

Edith Piaf,"Un piano est mort
Et celle-là l'aimait
Quand elle était jeune
Et quand elle venait se saouler l'dedans de pathétique
En se frottant au piano nostalgique
Qu'il était beau, le piano, bon piano, vieux piano des copains
À l'époque des copains
Chez Bianco l'argentier
Vers trois heures du matin
Quand elle buvait son demi d'oubli
Et seule, maintenant
Elle pense au vivant
De ce vieux piano mort
Elle voit, elle entend
Les messes de ses vingt ans
Tomber d'un accord
Au bar, quand elle boit
C'est vrai qu'elle revoit
Des mains sur l'ivoire blanc
Les mains de Bianco
Des mains qui lui font cadeau
D'un peu du vieux temps
Mais dans son jean
Un fantôme en blue jean
Un deuxième et puis vingt
Qui discutent en copains
D'un bistrot démodé
D'un piano démodé
Elle a crié ""Moi je sais! Moi je sais!""
Elle va raconter
L'histoire enfermée
Dans le vieux piano mort
Et c'est l'aventure
Qui bat la mesure
De plus en plus fort
Au clair de la vie
Les mains des amis
Les yeux des lendemains
La vie devant nous
L'amour, et puis tout
Et tout, et plus rien
Ils sont tous morts
Au milieu d'un accord
Ils sont morts dans Ravel
Dans un drôle d'arc-en-ciel

Edith Piaf,"Je revois la ville en fête et en délire
Suffoquant sous le soleil et sous la joie
Et j'entends dans la musique les cris, les rires
Qui éclatent et rebondissent autour de moi
Et perdue parmi ces gens qui me bousculent
Étourdie, désemparée, je reste là.
Quand soudain, je me retourne, il se recule,
Et la foule vient me jeter entre ses bras

Emportés par la foule qui nous traîne
Nous entraîne
Écrasés l'un contre l'autre
Nous ne formons qu'un seul corps
Et le flot sans effort
Nous pousse, enchaînés l'un et l'autre
Et nous laisse tous deux
Épanouis, enivrés et heureux.

Entraînés par la foule qui s'élance
Et qui danse
Une folle farandole
Nos deux mains restent soudées
Et parfois soulevés
Nos deux corps enlacés s'envolent
Et retombent tous deux
Épanouis, enivrés et heureux

Et la joie éclaboussée par son sourire
Me transperce et rejaillit au fond de moi.
Mais soudain je pousse un cri parmi les rires
Quand la foule vient l'arracher d'entre mes bras

Emportés par la foule qui nous traîne
Nous entraîne
Nous éloigne l'un de l'autre
Je lutte et je me débats
Mais le son de ma voix
S'étouffe dans les rires des autres
Et je crie de douleur, de fureur et de rage
Et je pleure

Et traînée par la foule qui s'élance
Et qui danse
Une folle farandole
Je suis emportée au loin
Et je crispe mes poings, maudissant la foule qui me vole
L'homme qu'elle m'avait donné
Et que je n'ai jamais retrouvé",La  Foule (Recontre Avec Raymond Assot)
Edith Piaf,"Il est venu pour la moisson.
C'était un fort et beau garçon
Aux yeux câlins, aux lèvres dures.
Tout en moissonnant, il chantait
Et, dans sa voix, l'on entendait
Toutes les voix de la nature.
Il a chanté le clair printemps,
Les oiseaux, les prés éclatants,
Les taillis verts, les fleurs nouvelles.
Le soir, pour les gens rassemblés,
Il a dit la chanson des blés
Dans la fausse courbe des Javelles.

Il a chanté.
Les moissonneurs l'ont écouté
Et la maîtresse aussi l'écoute.
Il a chanté
Puis il a dit ""A ma santé!
Et demain, je reprends la route""
Quand tout dormait, vers la minuit,
Comme il allait partir sans bruit,
La femme du maître est venue,
Toute pâle et le cœur battant
Et belle de désir pourtant
Et sous sa mante presque nue.
Elle a dit: ""C'est toi que j'attends,
Depuis des jours, depuis des ans.
Qu'importe une existence brève.
Reste auprès de moi jusqu'au jour
Chante-moi la chanson d'amour
Et que je vive enfin mon rêve!""

Il a chanté.
Les yeux clos, elle a écouté
Sa douce voix qui la prend toute.
Il a chanté
L'amour, la mort, la volupté
Et, tous deux, ils ont pris la route.

Ils sont partis le lendemain.
Elle a connu l'âpre chemin,
La faim, le travail, la tristesse
Car son amant, vite lassé,
Sans un regret pour le passé,
A caressé d'autres maîtresses.
N'en pouvant plus d'avoir souffert,
Après des nuits, des jours d'enfer
Elle a dit, la pauvre amoureuse
""Bien-aimé, n'aie point de remords.
Chante-moi la chanson des morts
Et laisse-moi, je suis heureuse""

Il a chanté.
Les yeux clos, elle a écouté
Le grand frisson qui la brûlait toute.
Il a chanté.
Dans un soupir, elle a passé
Et puis il a repris la route",Il  a Chante

Edith Piaf,"Les amants de Paris couchent sur ma chanson.
A Paris, les amants s'aiment à leur façon.
Les refrains que je leur dis,
C'est plus beau que les beaux jours.
Ça fait des tas de printemps et le printemps fait l'amour.
Mon couplet s'est perdu
Sur les bords d'un jardin.
On ne me l'a jamais rendu
Et pourtant, je sais bien
Que les amants de Paris m'ont volé mes chansons.
A Paris, les amants ont de drôles de façons

Les amants de Paris se font à Robinson
Quand on marque des points à coups d'accordéon.
Les amants de Paris vont changer de saison
En traînant par la main mon petit brin de chanson.
Y a plein d'or, plein de lilas
Et des yeux pour les voir.
D'habitude c'est comme ça
Que commencement les histoires.
Les amants de Paris se font à Robinson.
A Paris, les amants ont de drôles de façons.

J'ai la chaîne d'amour au bout de mes deux mains.
Y a des millions d'amants et je n'ai qu'un refrain.
On y voit tout autour les gars du monde entier
Qui donneraient bien le printemps pour venir s'aligner.
Pour eux c'est pas beaucoup
Car des beaux mois de mai,
J'en ai collé partout
Dans leurs calendriers
Les amants de Paris ont usé mes chansons.
A Paris, les amants s'aiment à leur façon.

Donnez-moi des chansons
Pour qu'on s'aime à Paris",Les Amants de Paris
Edith Piaf,"Elle lui disait ""On se croirait à Venise
Où les ruisseaux débordaient d'une eau grise""
Comme il pleuvait. Comme il pleuvait
Elle lui disait ""On se croirait en gondole,
J'entends ton cœur qui joue sa barcarolle.""
Comme il pleuvait Comme il pleuvait

Ils étaient là, blottis dans leur roulotte
Avec la nuit et l'orage à la porte.

Elle lui disait ""On se croirait à Venise.""
Il répondait ""Mais on est à Venise!""
Comme ils s'aimaient. Comme ils s'aimaient
Voici les feux scintillant par centaines,
La jolie nuit bariolée de lanternes.
Ferme les yeux
Tu verras mieux

Mais on ne voyait qu'un pauvre réverbère
Qui n'éclairait même pas leur misère
Et tout là-bas, au coin de la rue,
Une petite plaque d'un bleu pâli,
Où l'on voyait, écrit dessus
""Porte d'Italie""

La-la-la",Les Amants de Venise
